00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.894, Speaker A: To the EVM working group's weekly public update today. Looks like we're going to have not too many people. Wait a bit.
00:00:08.932 - 00:00:14.958, Speaker B: Wait a bit. I'm not sure that we have started. Looks like it started.
00:00:15.124 - 00:00:15.406, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:15.428 - 00:00:15.710, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:00:15.780 - 00:00:35.960, Speaker A: Okay. All right, well, let's do that again. So, hello everyone. Welcome to the EVM Working group's weekly update. I'm today we are not going to have a very long call. I think we don't have too many people joining us today. Let me share my screen.
00:00:35.960 - 00:00:39.386, Speaker A: You need to give me the permissions for that.
00:00:39.488 - 00:00:40.780, Speaker B: Yeah. Second.
00:00:44.350 - 00:01:13.860, Speaker A: Okay, let's have a look here. Okay. I trust everybody can see hack MD. Okay. Right. So we had planned a bigger agenda for today, but many people had conflicts and personal matters to attend to. So this will be a short call.
00:01:13.860 - 00:01:52.640, Speaker A: So today let's go over the current goal, the updates. And I don't think we have too much discussion with just us today. And here we need to add one more thing. Roadmap. So our current goal is that we are working. The overarching objective is that we are working towards a testnet release by the end of Q one. And to that end we are onboarding the new team members.
00:01:52.640 - 00:02:26.650, Speaker A: We had two team members join us last week and I hope we will have one more join us next. Are we have finished the roadmap planning with Alex and are now tasking out the things that need to be done. Let's talk about those in a bit. So, team updates, Alex, you can begin. Muted.
00:02:28.270 - 00:03:08.394, Speaker B: Yeah, so in general, the main thing that I was working during this week was the roadmap. These were the roadmap for both breach and EVM projects. And this is something that Arthur is going to share you with in some time. And there were also some organizational work, sorry, some organizational work connected to the governance forum. So not big of that. Some comments, some reading going a little bit different in some of the discussions, a little bit of the organization up there, the categories and stuff like that. Yeah.
00:03:08.394 - 00:03:16.570, Speaker B: And still a bit of hiring. I was spending some time, but mostly this is related for the bridge.
00:03:22.450 - 00:03:22.910, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:22.980 - 00:03:29.600, Speaker B: Some calls with the partners, with potential partners, things like that.
00:03:30.370 - 00:03:30.830, Speaker A: Okay.
00:03:30.900 - 00:03:38.498, Speaker B: So not that much to report, but lots of small tasks that just needed to be done.
00:03:38.664 - 00:04:14.880, Speaker A: Yeah. The same thing here this week has not been any coding, so I miss coding by now. Recruiting took up most of my time this week and I think we have some good results on that to announce soon. Additionally, the project management and planning took a lot of time. So we have created the roadmap for the EBM and indeed. Bridge. Jeff Ghani yes.
00:04:15.330 - 00:05:40.982, Speaker C: From my side reading a lot of documentation and specifically I start reading near protocol documentation and deep diving to that and I investigate that a lot of documentations probably out of dated and some page is not exist. But it's okay because I deep dive into near core quad and I look into structures and I understand how currently probably it work. And I want to say that for me it's really interesting and I really excited how it works. And additionally I want to say that currently probably I understand deeply how blockchain and runtime are working. I'm not sure that that understanding is completed, but from my side I want to in my free time reading that documentation because for me it's really interesting. Additionally, I want to say that I spent time to play with tutorials and from my side I started test validation lab. Currently I investigate the process because for me it's interesting too and how it works, how typically works with network.
00:05:40.982 - 00:05:58.558, Speaker C: So on I look into videos and tutorials additional about near protocol and after that I try some examples and building some applications. Not a lot, but I tried.
00:05:58.724 - 00:06:10.434, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, great. Yeah. Let's talk about if you're ready to take on some tasks next week. How do you feel about that?
00:06:10.632 - 00:06:12.706, Speaker C: I think it's a good idea.
00:06:12.888 - 00:07:21.530, Speaker A: Okay, so let's discuss after the call some tasks that can be good to start with. Thank you. And Frank is not able to join us today because of personal reasons, but his updates are that he finished well. He has a draft pull request for benchmarks ESC 721 benchmarks relating to the crypto zombies contract, and there is an issue still before we can merge it, he's getting an unexpected revert from the EVM, which he can't reproduce outside of our EVM. So that's something to investigate. I will add the link there later investigating and Ilya has a lot of updates, but I think we better let him speak about those in case he joins. So these are, let's call them architectural experiments.
00:07:21.530 - 00:07:23.370, Speaker A: Kirill.
00:07:26.190 - 00:09:00.060, Speaker D: Yeah, so this week's I would say I'm still on the onboarding stage and I'm getting myself familiarized within the whole New York system itself and exploring the forum articles, discussions about the near, about the base token for the bridge, et cetera. And I'm also exploring the videos. And for anyone who is interested in near, I can definitely recommend to take a look at the launch and learn series that are also mentioned in our onboarding guides and the near core overview by Maxtin. This series, I believe is very awesome and it's absolutely recommended for everybody who wants to deep dive in near for more. And I still haven't finished all of them yet, so I will continue with this as well. This week I also passed through some tutorials that were onboarding guide and still continue this because quite a lot of them there. And I also started exploring the New York smart contract on the solidity side and researching the possibilities for the upgradability for that contract and reviewing the possible solutions for that, including the open zeppelin one that we have just recently discussed to be a good idea to look for.
00:09:00.060 - 00:10:08.720, Speaker D: And I will continue with this part on the next week and probably test some use cases and comparing some of the approaches for that upgradability. And also yesterday we discussed with Alex Shochenko my probably first tasks for the following week. And I'm also started on this today and walking. The first one will be to walk over the Rendell Bridge documentation and check if everything is correct, is everything is launchable, do we have any issues with it? And if we have to correct this and then I will start to move into more refactoring and changing some parts of the breach related contract. These are the following tasks, so I will start with them after finishing the first one, but I believe this is a good start and looks good as from my side.
00:10:10.210 - 00:10:44.138, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. And Mike can't join us today. He has a scheduling conflict, but I think he didn't have any updates for this week. Okay, let me actually change the agenda a little bit. Since we've been asked to provide also the concept for the next week, let's make our agenda like this. So we discuss the current goal this week. Today specifically, we'll talk about the roadmap and then the high level tasking for next week.
00:10:44.138 - 00:11:27.674, Speaker A: Already a little bit touched on. So roadmap. So we have here a roadmap, I assume I shared my screen, not the tab. So you guys can see the roadmap, right? Somebody can confirm? Yeah. Okay, so we have a roadmap roughly outlined. This is not maybe the best way to look at it. I'll copy the chronological bullet points into here soonish, but let's have a look at it in a different way.
00:11:27.674 - 00:12:24.410, Speaker A: I'm going to share another window here. Where are we? There we are. Okay, so I've been doing a little bit diagramming with Alex in terms of how the task dependencies or milestone dependencies work look like, and this is the result. We also have one for the bridge, but that's for Alex to present on the next call. Okay, so here our objective. This quarter is the testnet release, followed by the beginning of the bug bounty for the testnet. So everything feeds into this, and this is achievable this quarter, although we are pretty much at the limit.
00:12:24.410 - 00:13:09.746, Speaker A: We can't have too many curveballs thrown at us if we're going to make this objective. Right now, there's a bit of a curveball in terms of the potential architectural changes that Ilya would like to make, which we need to discuss. Latest on next week's call and settle. But we have a lot of things we can proceed on in any case. Now, the critical path, as in the most critical path through this diagram looks like this. We have a bug bounty that we need to start in a month for the beta nets, and about three weeks after that, we need to take a decision for whether we are going to. In terms of what the bug bounty result is, they're going to have to take a decision.
00:13:09.746 - 00:13:58.550, Speaker A: Can we go to testnet? If we can? Well, the bug bounty program will run in any case, a little bit longer. It will run to the end of the month, and the testnet release would immediately follow in the last days of March or soon thereafter. In order to be able to begin the bug bounty program, we need a number of things, indeed, almost all the things. So let's look here. For one thing, we need to finish the upgrade of open Ethereum to a version which is incorporating the Berlin hard fork properly. That version doesn't exist as yet. It's in the works branch, but it will exist soon, and we need to get on board that branch.
00:13:58.550 - 00:14:46.600, Speaker A: And the reason we need this for the bug bounty program is that otherwise we are testing with a fundamentally different virtual machine, as in, the difference between what we are using right now and open Ethereum. Three, two is vast. So we better get onto this branch as soon as possible for this bug bounty to be meaningful. Now, secondarily, nobody can really work on this bug bounty, or few people can work on this bug bounty if we haven't properly documented how to use the beta net. Now, Mike's already done a great job on that. We have a ton of material on it, but we need a little bit more still. So that's largely for documentation and tooling this task over here.
00:14:46.600 - 00:15:34.040, Speaker A: On the other hand, there's no sense in launching the debug bounty if we haven't already completed the switch over to s balances in the evm. So that's also a dependency. Now, what we don't need for the bug bounty, we don't need ESC 20 bridging by the way, is everybody able to see the text in screen sharing? It can be a little bit small. I'm going to zoom in. So zooming in a little so we don't need for the bug bounty, the ESC 20 bridging. That's a separate matter that fits into the eventual testament release, a shared goal with the bridge team. What we do need, most likely this is not necessarily a given.
00:15:34.040 - 00:16:44.330, Speaker A: We probably need the f connector so that we can move over liquidity in some form from, let's say an Ethereum testnet to debug bounty. This is not a hard dependency because we could conceive of other ways to give people balances, but at the very least we need the upgrade and we need documentation on how to work with it. Now towards the quarterly objective, the Testnet release. There are other things we need, some are not very hard dependencies. So for example, we will ask at the end of the quarter the partners who have played with the beta net EVM how they feel about it, if they feel it's ready or not to go to testnet. On the other hand, this is not a hard dependency because feedback is fussy and it can potentially be addressed after the Testnet release. But in any case, it's there things we definitely need in order to do the Testnet release.
00:16:44.330 - 00:17:13.910, Speaker A: We need more information for the SRA team or the infrastructure team on how to handle any problems that might arise. Now you might think this would also be good before the beta net bounty when everybody's trying to break our beta net. And yes, you will be correct, but it's not a hard dependency there. It is a hard dependency for a testnet release. We also have to involve the community. Of course. We can't just willynilly upgrade Testnet ourselves.
00:17:13.910 - 00:18:15.050, Speaker A: Anything that goes to Testnet is slated for mainnet and we need to have a proper conversation about it. So about two weeks from now we should put up a proposal in the governance forum and start to get some discussion and ultimately approval from stakeholders. We can't schedule the upgrade without that. We also have concerns about performance. So right now the EVM is entirely unbenched. Now there's no huge reason to believe that we will have a performance issue there, bottleneck, but we better test it with some significant volume. And to that end we have the plan to develop a replayer, as in take the transaction feed from for example, initially one of the Ethereum testnets and just replay it on, bid on it and then eventually testnet.
00:18:15.050 - 00:18:41.554, Speaker A: So that's pretty much let's see all the milestones. We also have other things that are needed for this to be usable on Testnet, such as the Rainbow bridge front end. I think Alex actually this is probably out of date. We discussed we don't necessarily need the front end, we just need the connector to work, right?
00:18:41.672 - 00:19:13.850, Speaker B: Yeah, that's correct. So depending on, well, probably the testnet is not something that is going to be widely used by the end users. Obviously it would be a good thing for them to be able to do this, but still, and we expect that the developers that are going to try deploy the contracts, try how they are working, they would be able to go step by step with the connectors from command line interface and scheduling some and simple scripts.
00:19:14.010 - 00:19:55.290, Speaker A: Right. So this is the preliminary roadmap. There are many things that are implicit here. For example, in terms of the feature completeness that's not really explicitly addressed here, except in terms of, let's say the upgrade to open Ethereum. We have more things we could add here, but this is the general outline of how we're going to get to a testament release. This will be published later today in the forum on the EVM category on the forum. And I believe Alex plans to do the same for the bridge, for the bridge roadmap.
00:19:55.290 - 00:20:46.330, Speaker A: And then we will be able to share this with the marketing department and others who have an interest in it, including all external stakeholders. So let's talk about this a little bit. Do people have any questions, comments at this stage? I take that as a no. Okay. Now, in terms of the near term priorities, we have a few things that should be done pretty much immediately. So Alex is working on the bug bounty, arranging the bug bounty. We still have a little bit of time to that, but not too much.
00:20:46.330 - 00:22:00.142, Speaker A: Pretty much needs to be organized soon. He's also working on the bug bounty for the bridge team, which will run concurrently, as in also beginning on March 1. However, a difference between the two teams or the bug bounties is that the EVM is for bug bounty is for the beta net and the bridge teams. Bug Bounty is for the testnet, something we'll have to try and make clear in our communications on that. I am going to tackle the upgrade to open Ethereum as of next week, even though it is not a final branch yet. We better get onto that branch and handle any issues that come up as soon as including communication with the upstream. I'm hoping every Tuesday on calls with the open Ethereum team, they have a kind of community call where we can give feedback and what's not on this roadmap because it kind of came extemporary are the architectural changes that Eli is experimenting with and proposing.
00:22:00.142 - 00:23:02.386, Speaker A: And we will have to work through decision points on those next week in order for any of this to be feasible. So I hope we can have a good conversation about those decisions next week. Friday. So, Yevgeni, what I would propose that you could tackle now, you remember we had discussed that you and Kirill would tackle the bridge f connector from sort of both sides of the team divide as in Kirill from the bridge side and you from the EVM side. And that probably makes sense, although the timeline is pretty short and I know you guys sounding half time currently. What we'll probably have to do here is that we'll split up this work a little bit. So again, these are not tasks.
00:23:02.386 - 00:23:36.530, Speaker A: These are milestones. We'll split up the task in here a little bit and let's get you onto this in whatever form you're comfortable with. We'll discuss that on the Monday call. Latest for Kirill. I think you already had your tasks from Alex and for Frank. We're going to have to pull Frank off benchmarking. We still need Frank on performance but we're going to have to pull him to the replayer as of next week.
00:23:36.530 - 00:24:28.530, Speaker A: So Frank will work on the current pull request that he opened today. The work in progress. Let's see, what was the name of that? Right. So his pull request is 3866 and he needs to finish that. He has the thing has to troubleshoot with that, which could take some time. But after that we need to pull him to the replayer so that we can deploy it a month from now given that he's also halftime currently. So those are the immediate priorities plus the whole question with Ilya, Max and others regarding not breaking protocol consensus and having a good architecture for the EVM.
00:24:28.530 - 00:24:54.778, Speaker A: So that means let's go back to the agenda here. Agenda. Agenda. There we are. And I'll add the diagram and information here. For next week, though. That means that.
00:24:54.778 - 00:25:24.274, Speaker A: Let me consult my notes here. Right. So, Frank, on the replay for Yevgeni, we would need to figure out in terms of the onboarding guide. Have you set up already the local setup? The local setup for the pet shop, which is actually a lot of work, can take hours and hours. Do you already have all of that set up?
00:25:24.472 - 00:25:27.574, Speaker C: No. For pet shop. I am not analyzed pet shop.
00:25:27.612 - 00:25:28.438, Speaker B: I'm sorry.
00:25:28.604 - 00:25:29.174, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:29.292 - 00:25:30.920, Speaker C: I analyze another.
00:25:33.290 - 00:25:58.270, Speaker A: All right. So I would say that the first focus there would be to work through the Ethereum. Compatibility tutorials. So we need you to understand all of that material to be able to work on this. And those are all currently written up tutorials. We don't have any video on that and they are all from Mike. So in case of any feedback, talk to Mike directly.
00:25:58.270 - 00:26:34.970, Speaker A: For the pet shop, the near pet shop on EVM example, which I think is the most useful one to try to fully understand. There's two ways you can run that. You can use it on Betanet, which is super simple. It only takes a few minutes to get started if you have a beta net wallet, and that's good to work through, but ultimately you need the local setup and the local setup is a pain in the ass. It's no question about it. It will take some hours to figure out. Now, you had to set up everything in your debit environment with Docker that might or might not be reasonable.
00:26:34.970 - 00:27:13.062, Speaker A: Try to have a look at the instructions, see how much work there would be to do in Docker versus a local virtual machine. It can be that the local virtualbox or something like this could be a lot faster than figuring out how to get that dockerized. So in any case, let's talk about those on the Monday call. Latest. Now Curiel, Alex has guided, and on my side, I'll book on the open Ethereum chain to begin with and then deal with the base token in coordination with Ilia and Alex. Maybe you want to speak yourself, what your plan was for next week.
00:27:13.196 - 00:28:11.980, Speaker B: Yeah, so my plan, unfortunately, this week I was not able to do a deep dive into Zenhub. This is something that is already a long standing thing to do. So I'm going to do that. And yeah, I'm going to go straight into the governance questions because there are two things, the governance of the bridge and the rollout of the EVM, which both of these things should be prepared pretty quick. And a thing that is in parallel with this is the preparation of the bug bounty programs. So like multiple things here, I'm going to see what is going to move faster and still have a bit of coordination of the better testing community on the bridge side. So this also can take some time.
00:28:12.350 - 00:28:47.160, Speaker A: Okay, that sounds about right. And from Mike, in case he's available, we will try to figure out what needs to be done for the bug bounty in terms of documentation and tooling and then actually test those things out. And of course, Alex, we both have to get a little bit more organized with Zenhub. Okay. All right. So I think that's pretty much our required agenda. We managed to fit into half an hour.
00:28:47.160 - 00:28:58.214, Speaker A: Do we have anything to discuss with the set of people here? I would generally prefer we would have more people for discussion, but can we discuss anything useful?
00:28:58.342 - 00:29:44.134, Speaker B: We have some people joined, actually. I would like to bring to attention of the whole EVM team the discussion that is happening right now with regards to the accounting for the storage. And I believe our inputs here will be pretty important. So the idea is that currently storage takes quite a lot of near tokens to be locked. And for example, for the two fa, for the accounts of the users, it takes around 36 near, which is at current price is ridiculous. So there is an idea to lower this down.
00:29:44.172 - 00:29:44.326, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:44.348 - 00:30:44.620, Speaker B: And the reason for such high cost was that the model for it was calculated some time ago. Since then the price changed. And also there are some kind of changes in the amount of storage requirements of the smart contract, stuff like that. So this needs to be reconsidered. And this is something that is happening at the moment. This is extremely important because the current model for EVM team, because the current model that Nier is using is orthogonal to ethereum approach, where people are just paying, doing a one time payment in gas for the storage. Obviously, if the storage is free, then people are getting some gas back.
00:30:44.620 - 00:31:20.070, Speaker B: But this is something that is not widely used at the moment and potentially we can just skip that type of functionality. So there is an idea of bringing these two worlds. Yeah. And obviously this means that accounting for storage should be in case we are keeping things as is in near and in EVM. This means that accounting for storage are different in these runtimes. So that's the problem. So it's not uniform across the chain.
00:31:20.070 - 00:31:41.534, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm encouraging everyone to go, especially from the tech team, to go a little bit deeper into the discussion, express his own opinion on. So this is something that is, from a point of view, pretty important to us.
00:31:41.732 - 00:32:46.910, Speaker A: Plus, we have the question that if we are going to implement Ilias proposed architectural changes, then that does muddy the borders a little bit with regards to the storage accounting, as in that moves back to the normal native webassembly contract side, which then might make it too expensive. Yeah. So there's certainly some things to work through there. Anything else to discuss today? Okay, well, with that, we can have the shortest meeting ever. I like that there are discussions that need to be had, but looks like we're having them next week when we have more people available. So let's see here. Let's check for questions on YouTube as well.
00:32:48.800 - 00:32:50.300, Speaker B: No questions there.
00:32:50.450 - 00:32:51.150, Speaker A: Okay.
00:32:52.560 - 00:32:54.350, Speaker B: Kirill, you wanted to say something.
00:32:55.040 - 00:32:57.724, Speaker D: No, nothing at the.
00:32:57.922 - 00:33:17.700, Speaker A: Ok. Ok. Well, then. Then I wish everybody a happy weekend. And we have some busy weeks ahead of us. Let's Monday on what we're actually going to do and how. Okay, bye bye.
00:33:17.700 - 00:33:19.028, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:33:19.194 - 00:33:19.810, Speaker D: In the next call.
