00:00:00.570 - 00:00:26.582, Speaker A: All right, look, guys, I know that we have a lot to talk about, and we don't have that much time to talk about it. And I'm going to be perfectly honest with every single person in this room. I'm under prepared. So if it's a shit show, well, there's nothing you can do about it because you can't get signal in here anywhere. And there's no Wi Fi, so, hey, we're gonna be fine. For those of you who don't know, my name is David Morrison. As you can see, I'm on the screen right behind you.
00:00:26.582 - 00:00:40.380, Speaker A: I do all things social media and beyond at the near foundation, but it's not about me. It's about these wonderful folks here. So, guys and Mona, would you please go ahead and introduce yourself? The project that you represent and what you're all about.
00:00:41.630 - 00:01:03.678, Speaker B: Cool, I'll start. So, my name is Mona. I got into the space in 2016, founded one of the early DFI protocols. It was known as Melon protocol at the time, and it has since been rebranded to enzyme. It was the first on chain asset management protocol. And, yeah, and I'll stop there because I know we're on time.
00:01:03.844 - 00:01:17.620, Speaker C: Hello, everybody, my name is Claudio. I'm co founder of Metapool, the first and leading liquid staking solution on near and Aurora. And, yeah, we've been on mainet for around 19 months, and, yeah, alive and kicking, so I can't complain about that.
00:01:18.810 - 00:01:30.010, Speaker D: Hey, everyone, my name is Kendall. I'm one of the co founders of proximity, and we just try to help talented founders like these guys be as successful as possible building the DeFi ecosystem on Nier.
00:01:30.990 - 00:01:50.190, Speaker E: Hi, everyone. I'm ran, co founder of Orderly Network. We are a decentralized order book infrastructure powered by Nier, and we want to power the next generation of DeFi applications and any apps that have trading needs to use orderly.
00:01:51.090 - 00:02:08.878, Speaker A: Brilliant. Well, thank you so much. Nothing less than an honor to be here with you all. Let's kick it off with something bad. 2022. That was shit, wasn't it? For crypto, the world of web3. But I think I speak for everyone in this room when I say that DFI kind of proved itself there.
00:02:08.878 - 00:02:23.420, Speaker A: How did DFI change over those twelve months, and I guess into the first quarter of 2023, if it did at all? And what lessons can you take out of it for surviving things like what happened in 2022.
00:02:26.330 - 00:02:42.646, Speaker B: Okay, cool, I'll kick off then. Yeah, so I think 2022. Let's start with 2021. There was a lot of hype. 2020 and 20,002, one, there was a lot of hype. There was this movement called DFI 2.0. There was a lot of fast projects.
00:02:42.646 - 00:03:15.350, Speaker B: They were quick to market. They were maybe not following all your typical procedures, auditing, et cetera, rushing stuff out. And it was all about yield. DFI became about yield, which is not really what DFI is all about. So 2022, that all came crashing down. And I think going forward came crashing down because people took too much risk, people cut corners, people were not as transparent as they should have been. And also investors got a bit greedy.
00:03:15.350 - 00:03:36.720, Speaker B: And I'd like to think that 2023 and the recovery from that is actually going back to the DFI 1.0 values, which were built on transparency, decentralization, easy access and cheaper access. And I think that's something that near can really bring to the table, especially the last two.
00:03:37.090 - 00:04:04.994, Speaker C: Yeah, for us, we're a liquid staking derivative on Nier and Aurora. Yeah, we saw this explosive growth based on the narrative of cheap transactions, fast protocol, and we understood those were some of the fundamentals of why we built on Nier in Aurora. But then again, the market shifted. Right. The liquidity went out. Right. And there's a couple of rug pulls and bad situations.
00:04:04.994 - 00:04:24.134, Speaker C: The bad actors got weeded out. Right. Hopefully. And for us, the big learning is how do we go to fundamentals, right. For us, we provide a liquid staking derivative, which is destineer. It's a yield bearing asset. It is the less risky asset right now on DeFi.
00:04:24.134 - 00:05:16.758, Speaker C: And then it's understanding who you partner with and how do you provide value and stay true to the ethos of decentralization. How can you build protocols that are running on daos if that can be achieved or not? Right? And so we're continue building on top of it, and we're bullish on it. We're bullish on eer and Aurora. We understand also that it's a multi chain world and it's building those bridges and understanding how do you bring value to normal users. And more importantly, how do you bring that big opportunity of participating in DFI protocols without paying 50, $60 of transactions for those fees? I think neo brings that. And now we're back to the fundamentals, understanding how do we bring in mass adoption into DFI. For us, the big opportunity is going to be emergent markets.
00:05:16.758 - 00:05:26.800, Speaker C: And so that's where we cut our bread and butter. We're a team that is based in Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador. And so we understand the pain points there. And so that's where we're building our future.
00:05:29.810 - 00:06:33.060, Speaker D: Mean, I think, you know, both of you really nailed it. It's very much this return of sanity, a return to our roots, a return to fundamentals, and a return to building these resilient, accessible systems. And I think what was really positive about 2022, as you kind of alluded to, is that a lot of projects died and blew up fantastically, but a lot of even maybe not more projects, but certainly many projects actually didn't thrive, but they survived, and they were incredibly resilient in front of a pretty insane set of circumstances with one of the largest exchanges blowing up overnight, with regulators sinking their teeth into as many projects as they can. And a lot of these projects, particularly the DFI 1.0 and some of these fundamentally driven projects, are still here, I would say even stronger than ever, because now we know they can handle even the harshest of circumstances. And I think what's now returned for us looking forward is people are really thinking about how they can build systems that can actually withstand those extremely harsh market circumstances and most importantly, provide new access to net new people, which is really what DeFi is kind of all about.
00:06:34.470 - 00:06:36.760, Speaker A: Absolutely. Randy, anything you want to add?
00:06:37.610 - 00:07:03.658, Speaker E: Yeah, I think you guys covered most of everything. I started my career in Trapi back in six, during the financial cris, I was at Freddie Mac, center of the financial crisis. And what happened recently with FTX is also a CFI crisis, reminded me very much of what happened back in six. Eight. It's no different. It's a centralized failure. It's not a cause of DFI, it's not due to the blockchain.
00:07:03.658 - 00:07:27.526, Speaker E: I think DFI survived very well. If you look at all the protocols in DFI, they survived. So I think that proves that DeFi, and we strongly believe that DeFi is the future. First to replace, well, to take market share from CFI and then perhaps tradfi. That's something that we very much believe in. DeFI is very early. The user experience, the Uiux is not good.
00:07:27.526 - 00:07:35.740, Speaker E: It will improve. It's missing order books. And that's why we're building orderly. So we are very bullish on DeFi and DeFi on near.
00:07:36.190 - 00:08:07.840, Speaker A: Awesome, guys, thanks so much. Let's talk about LSD or lsds liquid staking derivatives. I think we've seen a lot of hype around these over the past few months, particularly in the ethereum ecosystem and certainly beyond. But what role do you guys think that they play in the realm of DeFi, particularly when we're in a bear market? Claudia?
00:08:08.740 - 00:08:10.672, Speaker C: I'm trying to push the ball the other way.
00:08:10.726 - 00:08:11.184, Speaker E: Right?
00:08:11.302 - 00:08:40.620, Speaker C: No, for us, we understood last year that there needed to be a middle ground between institutional retail, right. And so we started onboarding custodial services. We announced last year at Nearcon the support for fireblocks. Then at staking summit, it was Finoa. Now we're announcing that we're supporting Credo as well, and we got another ace up our sleeves. But then that'll leave for consensus. Sorry, no alpha today, David.
00:08:40.620 - 00:09:29.848, Speaker C: And the reason for this is that we feel that there's still a lot of the tokenomics around proof of stake protocols are with institutional investors. And so that's why we supported custodial services. And we believe also that this is a good way to also bridge between Web 2.0 or fintech applications that want to have access to liquid staking derivatives, but they have regulations that they have to comply to. And this is where a solution such as fireblocks, Credor, Finoa, can really become that bridge into web3 and also and web two applications on the financial side. So that's at least our take on it. And as everything right, we're alpha beta testing assumptions.
00:09:29.848 - 00:09:43.090, Speaker C: We're trying to make educated bets into understanding how do we unlock liquidity in these proof of stake protocols. And having near as the underlying infrastructure to build these solutions makes it all the while better.
00:09:45.060 - 00:10:44.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll just add, we've also been very focused last year using leveraging the bear market to bring the best of both worlds together. And enzyme is in the asset management space, which is very heavily regulated, whether it's on chain or off chain. And finding that bridge is really where we've been the focus. We believe that, as these guys alluded to, the future is more DeFi, not more CFI, because we've seen from this bear market that DeFi came out of this relatively unscathed. But in order for DeFi to be scalable and the next bull market, I really believe that the next wave up will be from institutions and new players that we haven't seen before. And for that, the infrastructure needs a little bit more work. And that's what people like metapool, ourselves and some others have been working on.
00:10:44.740 - 00:11:13.550, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. That's an interesting point that you raised, Morna, and it leads on to my next question. Feel free to chime in if you want to answer it, but Kendall ran. I think you guys are pretty well equipped for it. For those in the room who don't know, can you explain a little bit about the differences between the DeFi ecosystem within Nia and then perhaps some other chains that people are more familiar with. And if there is any major differences, how can people really leverage these in turbulent times like today?
00:11:14.960 - 00:12:08.040, Speaker D: Yeah, happy to kick that one off. Well, I think what's interesting about the near DeFi ecosystem is that it started to kind of coalesce around some areas that other ecosystems haven't been as focused on. And my personal favorite one to talk about is order books like the guys at orderly are building. And the reason that we're so excited about it is because if you look at the majority of price discovery, that happens on the most liquid markets, period, and that this includes crypto, by the way, that happens on order books. And I think what's really fascinating about near and some of these higher throughput chains is that we can actually finally build these protocols on these chains, whereas we couldn't on base layer eth. Now, some of the l two s maybe, but certainly not base layer eth. And so what's interesting is we're starting to see near be less about kind of copy, like near the DFI, be less about kind of like looking at what worked on Ethereum and some of the design decisions that were made for protocols on Ethereum.
00:12:08.040 - 00:12:26.580, Speaker D: And they're starting to actually lean into the things that near enables that weren't actually possible on those other ecosystems. And specifically, this is something like orderbooks. And so I think we're really excited to see how the entirety of the near DFI ecosystem, but even beyond that, starts to evolve around these kind of new primitives.
00:12:29.080 - 00:13:00.200, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll just add one point. So just with the building we were on near for about a year, building orderly slide for three months on Mainnet. Six pairs listed. Not much yet, but a lot more perps coming very soon. Three big integrations with uis, with a lot of users coming this month and the next, that whole process has been really smooth. Near's account system is actually very good for exchanges. That's one point that a lot of other chains do not have.
00:13:00.200 - 00:13:23.620, Speaker E: The fast finality time, the cheap transaction costs. It's really good for order books, which are very high latency, high TPS kind of systems that require, if the fees are too expensive, it just doesn't work. But it's working properly. Now, we don't have a ton of volumes yet, but we can really see a scale in an effective way that doesn't clog up the system or become too costly.
00:13:24.840 - 00:13:54.370, Speaker A: All right, brilliant. Got a couple more questions, guys. I know we do want to keep it tight, stable, coins. That's a hot topic, right? Especially in the near ecosystem, perhaps. I think some people consider them somewhat a safe haven, particularly in turbulent times and bear markets. But how can you best utilize stablecoins to make sure you come out of a bear market on the other side a little bit better than when you went in? And if your answer is just leave them and don't fucking touch them, then that's fine too.
00:13:55.540 - 00:15:03.140, Speaker B: I'm actually in the camp that right now, this is not investment advice. You shouldn't be doing anything with your stable coins because the yield in DeFi is so low that it's just not worth any of the smart contract risk. However, I do think it's interesting times to start getting, like, for companies that have substantial Runway and that can take a little bit more risk, I think it's an interesting time to start getting into sort of a little bit more volatile assets, as long as you can maintain, like a healthy Runway. Because for me, the interesting thing is that since November 11, when FTX filed for bankruptcy, we've had so much bad news in the space, and all we've seen is the crypto space drift higher, which for me tells me that the leverage is out of the system and anyone who was going to sell has sold now. And so it could be the basis of us bottoming out. And maybe this is the time to start accumulating more higher beta stuff again and then putting that to work where the yields are more exciting there. Things like, yeah, I'm not going to name stuff because that is investment advice.
00:15:05.560 - 00:15:34.384, Speaker C: So my two cent on stablecoins, and I believe here, like just a show of hands, who lives in an emerging market? Argentina, Mexico. No show of hands. Okay, just one there. And this is a big thing, right? Most of you don't feel the pain of inflation. Most of you do not know what 300% inflation means. So for you, stablecoins are right now at a bear market. She said, it's useless, right? Don't go there.
00:15:34.384 - 00:16:22.316, Speaker C: But in Argentina, it's a safe haven. Safe haven, why? Because in this, I'm going to quote my co founder Lucio, when this bear market started, he said, why are people so nervous about, I live in a country which has a shitcoin as a fiat currency. Why is everybody worrying? Right? And of course, yes, I went there two weeks ago and they understood the value of a stablecoin. So there are illegal money exchanges that trade bitcoin, ETH, USDC, USDT for argentinian pesos, and likewise as well. And it brings a ton of value to emerging markets because it's the way that you hedge inflation. We're doing an early POC with Cresi IO. It's a crypto credit card in Mexico.
00:16:22.316 - 00:16:56.132, Speaker C: And so what we're doing with them is that we're allowing people to collateralize near and they grab a loan in pesos, but behind it on the back channel is, or, sorry, on the smart contract, it's USDC. USDT. So that way you're hedging. The cresi is doing a great job there because they're hedging against inflation. They know that they did an emission on mexican pesos and so they're making a business out of that. Right. So there are a lot of opportunities in emerging markets for stablecoins.
00:16:56.132 - 00:17:30.020, Speaker C: So we're bullish on it, but we understand that there's also a lot of risk. And here is where it's a fine line that you're threading here. And you have to understand that you are playing with people's money and resources and you have to be mindful of it. But then again, these are regulated fintech applications, and so that gives us the confidence that they're going to be putting users best interest in front of what they're doing. But that's just a small part of the equation. Perfect.
00:17:30.090 - 00:17:32.470, Speaker A: Kendall. Rand, is there anything else you want to add to that?
00:17:33.880 - 00:17:35.664, Speaker D: I think that summed it up very nicely.
00:17:35.712 - 00:17:37.220, Speaker C: I'll leave it with that.
00:17:37.370 - 00:17:37.792, Speaker E: Awesome.
00:17:37.866 - 00:17:56.430, Speaker A: Okay, look, I know we are a bit tight on time, so I will leave you with this one final question. Top tips to survive bear markets by leveraging defi. You can even suggest that they should perhaps brew green tea every single morning. Whatever it might be. Take it away.
00:17:58.000 - 00:18:14.900, Speaker D: I'll just say that bear markets are builders markets. So this is the best time, it's the least noisy time, to kind of look at the fundamentals, understand how these things work, understand what's done really well in these harsh conditions and what hasn't, and just get back to kind of the basics.
00:18:17.080 - 00:18:46.350, Speaker B: I'd say I totally agree with what Kendall said. I think a strategy that we used in the last bear market was cut costs aggressively and get your team to buy into taking tokens as compensation. Because ultimately, if you believe that this is the bottom of the market, then this really pays off longer term. You can extend your Runway by getting them to cut the fiat costs and then really get a payoff longer term for everyone on the team.
00:18:49.440 - 00:19:13.940, Speaker E: Well, we are fortunate to have raised 20 million last year and we have enough Runway. And for the rest of the if there's builders out there, we're happy to support you guys. If you want to build a decks on top of orderly or if you have any trading liquidity features in your app, happy to chat with you because we're very supportive of builders and we need that for waterly.
00:19:15.400 - 00:19:40.544, Speaker C: Yeah, for us. So we have a liquid staking SDK as well. So if there's any builders out there that want to build on top of it. So I'll be mentoring tomorrow, all day, all night during the buildathon. So hit me up on Telegram or WhatsApp or whatever. Glad to help you out. If you're interested also in understanding better emerging markets, by all means, let's have a conversation, you guys and gals and them.
00:19:40.544 - 00:20:00.880, Speaker C: You're building great products and sometimes where the value creation will be first seen or where you'll be having a great impact is in emerging markets. So I incentivize everybody to have a look at it and yeah, just hit me up there and I'm glad to help out anybody that's building on this hackathon.
00:20:01.300 - 00:20:13.510, Speaker A: Brilliant. Thank you so much. Mona Clario, Kendall Rand, thank you for all the wonderful information you shared with us today. Let's hear it for them. I know we're low energy. The party soon, don't worry. And thank you very much.
