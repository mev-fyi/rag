00:00:00.330 - 00:00:44.634, Speaker A: Hey everyone, Dorian here to give you the latest on tapping the near ecosystem. This is nearbytes. Bear with me on this new mic. I was traveling to London and my old microphone unfortunately broke. So until I get back to United States, we're gonna be using this one for now. So first up on the list is a new social login from the wild sector team coming up ago. So this is announced in the community call that happens bi weekly conducted by Josh Ford, which I really encourage you guys to get part of because it's really cool way to get in touch with the core team members as discuss new products and new features coming out of the pagoda ecosystem and giving you a chance to talk to them directly and ask questions about the new tooling and or standards to move forward.
00:00:44.634 - 00:00:48.330, Speaker A: The new social login feature will allow for users to log to decentralized application.
00:00:48.400 - 00:00:50.666, Speaker UNK: With Google or Facebook utilizing a new.

If you guys want more information, just stay tuned, stay subscribed to the channel. We're going to come out and give you more information as the product progresses. Speaking of metatransactions, the first working group call will be taking place on November 21, which will allow you to help shape the foundation of the near ecosystem. So I really encourage you guys to get started.

So keep an eye for that. I hope you guys like it. It will be built to get full front end and smart contracts. So a full decentralized application from the ground up just to teach you guys how to get started with building your own decentralized application on top of deer.
