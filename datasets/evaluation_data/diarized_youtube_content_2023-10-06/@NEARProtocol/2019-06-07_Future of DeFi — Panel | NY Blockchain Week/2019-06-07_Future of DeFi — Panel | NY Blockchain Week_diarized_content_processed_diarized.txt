00:00:04.880 - 00:00:46.210, Speaker A: I'll just start with a quick word about near protocol. We are pretty much a layer one blockchain, and our main focus is pretty much bring blockchain to everybody, make it usable, scalable. Pretty much every developer be able to build on this decentralized future, and every single customer in the world pretty much convert to it. And I'm really excited to kind of hear how so far the projects presented here have been evolving, as well as what they're looking forward in the future. So without further ado, please like few words of introductions and we can dive into questions. And if you have some more questions, we will do them later.
00:00:48.020 - 00:00:48.432, Speaker B: Cool.
00:00:48.486 - 00:01:27.230, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Richard, working on a project called Balance, and we have a web user interface that people use to interact with their Ethereum based tokens. The innovation there was just showing you your token balances, which turned out to be a lot more challenging than we expected, and recently been focusing much more on a mobile tracker for all of the interactions that your wallets make with decentralized finance. After talking to lots of users, discovered that most people are kind of doing these big trades on the desktop or using a kind of hardware wallet, but they'd like to keep track of them on their phone. So those are the two products that balance has in the market right now.
00:01:29.460 - 00:01:48.340, Speaker D: Kane from Synthetix. We're a synthetic asset trading platform. So we've got assets like synthetic BTC, synthetic BNB, inverse assets, et cetera. So we basically allow people to have exposure on Ethereum to assets that aren't trading on Ethereum.
00:01:51.240 - 00:02:44.150, Speaker B: My name is Mariano, I work at Maker. We developed dive tablecoin and we're essentially one of the backbones of DFI. Now, Dai is not the biggest coin in terms of supply. We're right now at maybe 82. Well, after this last rally, we may be at 84, 84 million, which is not a lot if you compare it to other tokens, maybe like tether, that has been up to like 2 billion. But one of the things, key issues that I think we solve is decentralization, and we consider Dai the most decentralized stablecoin in the ecosystem. And yeah, we'll talk more about it.
00:02:44.940 - 00:03:08.460, Speaker E: I'm Calvin. I'm the head of strategy at Compound, which broadly means I focus on business growth. Compound is a ethereum based lending protocol, so we create on chain liquidity pools that are openly accessible and programmatically accessible for lending and borrowing. Ethereum based crypto assets.
00:03:15.520 - 00:03:26.070, Speaker A: Okay, great. So let's jump in. So, first question to kind of keep you guys warm, what's your customer right now. And what do you think is your ideal customer?
00:03:28.680 - 00:03:53.980, Speaker C: Yes. So today, I think is the 10,000 people tweeting about DFI. It's a very small audience and I pay quite a bit of attention to the number of people who are actively using DAi on a weekly basis. We're under 20,000 there. So it's an incredibly narrow customer base, but I'm optimistic that's going to expand. And sure, these folks have different approaches.
00:03:55.440 - 00:04:28.890, Speaker D: Yeah, I think at the moment most of the DeFi users are kind of decentralization maximalists or people that are ideologically aligned to decentralization because there's a lot of trade offs. So our user base is pretty small right now. But the hope is that as all of these different protocols kind of come together and enable new use cases like compound and maker working together, et cetera, and better interfaces to kind of interact with these protocols, that we'll be able to bring more mainstream adoption, more average users into the space.
00:04:30.940 - 00:05:21.268, Speaker B: So we usually divide our user base in two. There's more, but essentially DAi creators and Dai holders. DAi creators are the people who speculate, right? They open up a CDP, they're power users. They want to maybe expose themselves to more risk by leveraging the DAI to buy more ether, or they want to take out a loan for something. And the DAI holder is someone who may not be that savvy, and all they want to do is hold a stable asset. Those are the two main ones. And even though there's some overlap, they're so different that it essentially requires two different strategies altogether.
00:05:21.268 - 00:05:33.950, Speaker B: Because some of them really want power tools to create cdps to interact with a system. And other people, they just want to see a number that actually doesn't change over time as much.
00:05:37.200 - 00:06:12.500, Speaker E: We have lenders and borrowers at this point. Most of the people who hold a lot of crypto over the bear market of the past twelve or 18 months or whatever are pretty much long for a long time. So the value proposition to lenders is pretty simple, and I think it could be anybody. If you are long crypto and you can earn any percentage of yield, even if it's 1-2-3 it's pretty attractive. On the borrowing side, it's more complex. There's a few reasons people borrow. People borrow to lever up, people borrow to short, and people borrow for basically working capital.
00:06:12.500 - 00:06:55.640, Speaker E: Those are three of the primary reasons. So that encompasses miners for working capital, market makers for working capital, and funds to either lever up or short. Today, in compound, most of our users are really crypto savvy, really kind of like decentralized, ideal types of crypto investors who are willing to spend the time to learn how to use a protocol like compound or even understand how ethereum works. But we think the product has value for the biggest funds and institutions, and that's where we're trying to build bridges to connect something like compound to those types of users.
00:07:00.140 - 00:07:34.390, Speaker A: So it's interesting because pretty much you're saying right now it's all crypto savvy people, people who already own a lot of crypto, people who want to have crypto holdings, but don't want the thing to change or want it to grow, ideally. So the question is, given that, what is the metric that you're optimizing for? Right. What is actually the goal for your protocol or application be right, because maybe it's not mass adoption or how do you kind of compare that and mass adoption for every customer in the world kind of thing?
00:07:39.320 - 00:08:27.380, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what I like about Dai is that because it has become the kind of base currency for this decentralized finance movement, tracking its progress and the impact that you have on that progress for balance could be, like, one way of looking at it. And so if we're in this phase of tens of thousands, what gets us another zero will be something that you can focus on now. And then once we're there, it's probably a different set of things that where you get to add another zero to that number. So I'm thinking really just about the next zero, and I don't know where I'll go after that, but I'd be curious to hear how we get from kind of really 10,000 monthly active users of this system to kind of 100,000 and then onwards.
00:08:30.200 - 00:09:20.340, Speaker D: The main use case of our protocol at the moment is through synthetics exchange, which is a Dex. So trading volume is obviously something that we're tracking. So on Friday, we did about $400,000 in trading volume, which also was coincidentally, the largest day for Bitmax, which is, like the most centralized competitor of ours, that did about 10 billion. So we're a little ways away from them, still a ways to go. But it's a huge market in trading. So that's one thing that we watch really closely, is just trading volume and growth, but also we watch, like, daily active users as well. Right, because someone can come in and do a big block trade of 100 grand, but you could also have 50 people coming in and trading 100, $200, and that's just as important because we want not just a few large whales trading, but actually user growth as well, because that kind of helps to spread the message.
00:09:20.340 - 00:09:23.270, Speaker D: So those are the kind of the two main metrics that we follow.
00:09:26.360 - 00:10:00.160, Speaker B: I would say 1 billion die. Talking about adding an extra zero, it's. That's personal. That's like my metric. That's what I would like to see. I think there is internally at maker a number maybe not necessarily related to actual supply, but for me it would really be a billion die. That would mean that depending.
00:10:00.160 - 00:10:27.070, Speaker B: It's almost impossible to do right now just with single collateral die. Right. Because I'm not going to do the math here, but at the moment, we have almost 2% of all ether locked up in the system. Right. And there's only so much eth that you can lock up. So essentially we need to come out with multilateral DAi and have that die be created by borrowing from other assets. Right.
00:10:27.070 - 00:11:00.950, Speaker B: But that is the metric that I would like to see. And right now, the other ones that we check is amount of active die holders internal volume. The other day we had almost 100 million die moved around in 24 hours. It's difficult to check how much of that is actual wash trading, which there's probably a lot of it, but even then, I don't think we've had ever hit 100 million die moved transfer in 24 hours. So those are the big ones.
00:11:03.080 - 00:11:49.072, Speaker E: What we care about is borrowing. We have about $40 million of assets in the protocol across five markets, and we have about five and a half million dollars of open borrowing right now. Borrowing makes everything work. If there's no borrowing, there's no interest rate. If there's no interest rate, people aren't going to supply any capital. So while supplied assets is a nice number, kind of for news or Twitter or to spread, because aum is a large number, borrowing is much less than Aum, but it's what we care about the most. And I would just say the capabilities that I think blockchain enables for this type of borrowing, like basically it's always on and always accessible, and everything settles every 15 seconds on the Ethereum blockchain.
00:11:49.072 - 00:12:05.290, Speaker E: You can't do that in traditional securities lending. Things settle like midday or once a day. So there's a lot of potential for interesting borrowing functionality that doesn't exist today, but that's what we care about.
00:12:12.480 - 00:12:39.430, Speaker A: You have pretty much all those great metrics, which are pretty low right now, and you aspiring for more. So the question is, what is actually stopping to have that extra zero on every of those metrics and there's different levels. Right. There's protocol level, your application level, or there is generally people are not aware of it. Right.
00:12:42.200 - 00:13:23.300, Speaker C: Yeah, I spent a lot of time talking to fiat crypto on ramps. I really think that the more of those, the better. I'm pretty excited about one project in eastern Europe called ramp that's doing kind of swaps so you can do from your bank account into crypto. Really excited about wire and their move to a kind of fiat to crypto API. But I kind of want to see like a thousand competitors go after this because coinbase shut down their API or change the terms of it. So it's not really become a piece of infrastructure that you can rely on. So, yeah, I think more people competing on these smooth fiat decrypto on ramps in every single country in the world is going to help people slide over to these assets a lot more easily.
00:13:25.480 - 00:14:22.100, Speaker D: I think just generally in the space, usability is one of the kind of most difficult aspects of adoption. You need some level of sophistication right now to be able to use these platforms and these dapps, but it's gotten a lot better even in the last year. So I think we're seeing a movement towards better user experience and more accessibility. But there's obviously other things as well, like scalability is a pretty important thing, particularly for dexes and trading platforms, less so for lending, I think. But for us, we want people to be able to have the exact same experience on our platform on chain without having a custodian of their assets as they have on something like BitMex. So if we can get to that point, then once you've got that kind of equal utility, then people will start to shift over. So that's kind of the goal.
00:14:24.120 - 00:15:15.012, Speaker B: So in our case, one of the things is, of course, that single collateral die was always meant to be like a beta version of the final product. Right? Multicolateral die is the idea realized of everything we've been working for. So one of the things we have is a debt ceiling of 100 million, so we would never go above that amount. And people, at the beginning, they started using it without actually considering that this was never supposed to grow as big as it did. And so a lot of projects, for example, Auger never introduced Dai into the system just because they. No, no, let's wait for MCD. Let's wait for MCD.
00:15:15.012 - 00:15:50.130, Speaker B: And I think that's probably one of the platforms that could actually give another use to the token that's not mostly for speculation. So that's probably one of the big ones. There's a few projects that we talked with that they just didn't want to do the work to include Dai as it is, and said that, well, if you are calling this a beta, then we're just going to wait for you to build the finished product. Right? Yes.
00:15:54.580 - 00:16:58.504, Speaker E: The way I kind of think about it is like we started on Ethereum and then we built the combat protocol on top of Ethereum. It's kind of one layer above the largest funds and institutions are somewhere what they're used to using are they don't care if the solution is decentralized or not. They only care about if it offers interesting functionality that they couldn't achieve before. And I think that most of the largest funds and institutions who have the most money and also are sophisticated enough to borrow, they don't even have the right good infrastructure today to trade in a centralized trade, well, in a centralized manner. So there's a lot of people developing centralized trading solutions for funds and institutions. There's a lot of people developing kind of like decentralized solutions. And somewhere they're going to have to meet in the middle, like whether it's up to someone like compound to build the tools that abstract away what compound really is at the Ethereum layer until it shows up in the equivalent of schwab.com
00:16:58.504 - 00:17:10.910, Speaker E: or whatever, or if it's the responsibility of someone who's building portfolio management tools for funds to eventually integrate DeFi solutions, I don't know. I think both attempts are going to happen, but I think we're going to have to meet somewhere in the middle there.
00:17:12.400 - 00:17:27.516, Speaker F: I mean, I kind of came mid question. I have no idea what it was. I'm happy to start with the next one. Or you can. Yeah, my name is Hayden Adams. I created a project called Uniswap. It's a decentralized exchange protocol built on top of Ethereum.
00:17:27.516 - 00:17:32.710, Speaker F: Yeah, that's about it.
00:17:35.800 - 00:17:47.524, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, let's do that. Well, what are the interesting insights you see in the market from running this application in real life? What are the new emerging behaviors?
00:17:47.572 - 00:17:52.344, Speaker F: You see the new emerging behaviors specifically on Uniswap or in general?
00:17:52.542 - 00:17:53.290, Speaker A: Both.
00:17:53.740 - 00:18:36.488, Speaker F: Yeah, I think that uniswap, the new emerging behaviors, I mean, definitely, like front running and arbitrage are two things that it's not that new, I guess that's not new at all, but maybe everyone being able to compete to do it right now, I guess you have to have this hardware set up. I don't know. I mean, Uniswap is kind of cool because it allows you to do fully decentralized, fully censorship resistant trading, which is not something that really existed before in the markets. So I think that's cool. I don't know, I'm a little out of breath because I've ran here. I was like half an hour away. Yeah.
00:18:36.488 - 00:18:41.450, Speaker F: When I realized I was supposed to be here. Yeah, I'm not sure.
00:18:44.380 - 00:18:50.300, Speaker E: I think unisox is super cool. And like emerging Unisox.
00:18:51.040 - 00:19:10.370, Speaker F: Unisox exchange a dynamically priced sock. Every sock you buy increases the price of the next one, and then you can sell it back into the market, or you can burn them to redeem them for a pair of socks, and we'll mail them to you anywhere in the world. Doesn't matter. Shipping, taxes included. Yeah, I don't think that that was doable before.
00:19:14.660 - 00:20:15.052, Speaker E: What I think for combine, we care about assets on, we want to build so that assets get swept into compound. And I think something like Unisox, this mechanism has the potential to bring on new types of assets on chain that aren't on chain today, like socks. But anyways, the two things that come to mind when you ask that question are, number one, the arbitraging of yield across different types of products. So now you could stake liquidity on Uniswap, or there's like many places you can seek yield either through proof of stake protocols or different types of lending protocols, and people will arbitrage those rates. And the other thing that I was thinking about. Give me 1 second. Oh yeah, the people borrowing for governance.
00:20:15.052 - 00:20:47.600, Speaker E: So before, realistically, you should be borrowing assets not only to lever up short or for working capital, but to use them. But none of these assets have had any actual use, and they're starting to be, I think one of the first use cases of many of these tokens that actually don't have like an intrinsic utility is that you can use them to vote. So there have been votes like zero x related votes, or maker votes potentially, where someone could borrow maker to vote or auger to vote, or zero x to vote. And I think that's an interesting emerging behavior.
00:20:53.560 - 00:21:36.032, Speaker B: Well, there's this term I've heard. I don't know if it comes from David Hoffman, someone else, they call it money. Just, it's grabbing everything that everybody here is building on and just creating something new, putting one on top of the other, one next to the other. Something that we've seen is a lot of projects are now paying their employees in Dai if possible. There's people in projects that actually requested that because they were getting paid in etH, maybe. And in 2017, it was probably like a very good thing. And then in 2018, they figured not so much.
00:21:36.032 - 00:22:46.150, Speaker B: Right? And one of the cool things that I see is streaming salaries. I don't know if you've seen it. If you work for 30 days, then five or ten or 15 days later after the month ended, you get paid. It's like, why can I not be paid per second? And if ten days have passed, I have already ten days of my salary that I can take out. But that's not even the best thing. It's like, how about you start paying me my money the moment it's happening? But then instead of just putting it there, how about you lend some of it on compound or put it in a liquidity pool or even do some trading if you want to get risky with the money that is just coming in and eventually controlling everything via a mobile wallet? That I think is pretty much like what this talk is about the future of Defi. That's what I want to see.
00:22:48.140 - 00:23:50.488, Speaker D: I think one of the things we've seen recently, certainly with Uniswap, is probably the best example of it, is this idea of pool liquidity or peer to contract trading. We've got a similar model, although the limitations are slightly different. But the idea is that anyone can turn up at this contract and interact with it, right? And not having order matching, not having to find a counterparty, means that for the average user, it's a lot more usable, and you don't need to bootstrap network effects in the same way. So when you start a kind of peer to peer trading exchange built on zero x, something like radar, for example, if you have a new token that's listed and there's no liquidity, the average user who turns up who wants to trade it on that market is going to have a pretty bad experience. Whereas with uniswap, people can kind of dump all their tokens in there. They can do that over the course of like a week or two weeks or whatever. And then every time a user turns up to trade, there's a market that's automatically there, it doesn't need to be matched.
00:23:50.488 - 00:24:33.530, Speaker D: And I think that that's something that's kind of routing around the limitations of a decentralized system where arbitrage and front running and all of those problems kind of exist. And obviously we still have front running and uniswap, but it's a different kind of front running. And I think that those sorts of solutions where instead of just trying to replicate an existing system and say, let's just try and replicate binance, but on chain or whatever, we're just starting to see kind of experimentation and iteration and finding a little bit better fit. So for me, those kinds of unique solutions that work with decentralization rather than trying to fight against it, I think are going to be what kind of gets us a lot more utility over the next twelve to 18 months.
00:24:35.020 - 00:24:35.432, Speaker B: Cool.
00:24:35.486 - 00:25:08.896, Speaker C: Yeah. Just curious, how many people here, if you don't mind raising your hand, have tried opening a CDP or like holding it? Okay, cool. So, I mean, that's about a third of the room. The big insight I had was adding CDP tracking to the mobile app that we were working on. Just increased usage by like 100 times over a month. So people are checking their CDP religiously because a lot of them are running it right to the wire. That was a really cool insight.
00:25:08.896 - 00:26:15.732, Speaker C: And Maker has like a very mature set of APIs that take the data from the Ethereum blockchain and then present an API that I could design a user interface for. And my natural inclination is then to go through as many of the decentralized financial products as possible and to kind of craft other interfaces that will allow people to check other things. But that is where I've run into a few issues and I'm kind of going down the rabbit hole is accurately reflecting the state of the blockchain is quite difficult. And so different projects have stood up their own APIs where they're kind of ingesting data from Ethereum and then presenting an endpoint. But sometimes actually those endpoints are incorrect and so the balances are out of sync, the tokens aren't matching, and then we're all going back to ether scan for the data. And so my fear here is just giving people wrong information and it can be quite challenging. And that is really what I'm hoping to do with balance, is find the kind of best data sources and present the kind of clearest data to people for this decentralized financial movement.
00:26:15.732 - 00:26:40.850, Speaker C: But the irony is that you're kind of extremely dependent on centralized services to ingest the data and present you with an API. So that's been my biggest insight, is that what is in your wallet is way beyond a set of tokens now. It's a kind of set of relationships with different contracts. Expressing that with a crystal clear user interface is tricky, especially when the data quality is still not great. So that's what I've been learning.
00:26:41.700 - 00:27:14.940, Speaker B: Can I add one thing? No. Because when you were saying I was remembering something that happened with the cdps, and this was totally nothing that we planned, but we eventually wanted to have, like, a secondary market of cdps where people would sell off if they couldn't pay out their debt or anything. But before that even came out, people started trading their cdps because of their id number. And I remember, can I tell it, you bought CDP 420.
00:27:15.010 - 00:27:19.596, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. That's my charity, CDP.
00:27:19.708 - 00:28:30.070, Speaker B: It's his charity, CDP. CDP 420. And the guys from instadap are here, and they actually use, I don't know if they still do it, because the fees right now are a little bit high. But they opened the CDP and they had a button where anybody could pay out some of their debt as a contribution for making the site. And I know that a few people started doing this because almost nobody knew that you can pay out anybody's debt, right? Only the owner of the CDP can actually create debt, but anybody can pay it. And when the instad up guys, they put out a button saying, pay die for any CDP, some of the most well known ones that always like to have round numbers, people were paying out like cents or like, one way of die and messing up the whole numbers, and then they would be like, okay, they would draw again, one way, and then they would do it again. It was kind of crazy.
00:28:33.900 - 00:28:57.710, Speaker A: The war of wave. Awesome. So you guys build interfaces, protocols, exchanges. What do you think is missing in defi space? What do you think? What would be one app that you would like? Oh, yeah, we'll use it today, and it will pretty much improve the ecosystem and kind of probably help with bringing more people, more liquidity into the market.
00:28:59.700 - 00:30:30.216, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we have to offer things that are just not possible and that are enabled by a protocol or a blockchain, and that might look like a kind of better savings rate on your die or your dollars, where it just kind of beats anyone else in the market, but it probably also involves, I think, some level of access. I think one of the things that is very exciting to me about this entire movement, I spent a little bit of time at stripe, and I really only think it could have been the collisons that built that company, because to get the keys to the kingdom, right, to get access to the FTP servers, for the banks to issue the payments and charge the cards, and kind of manage Wells Fargo's relationship, that was a masterclass in negotiation for some early 20 year olds. I mean, absolutely incredible. And that really speaks to how hard it is to access a kind of closed source financial system. Which is kind of deeply ingrained by very, very few institutions. What excites me here is that everyone gets to play with this stuff. And just as Linux found kind of product market fit with the Internet, my hope is that ethereum and other protocols and this kind of open source financial system finds product market fit in places that are not being served by traditional financial institutions.
00:30:30.216 - 00:30:34.110, Speaker C: And that trend is kind of going to play out over the next 20 years.
00:30:37.920 - 00:31:14.676, Speaker D: I want to say better interfaces and mobile interfaces and things like that. But I think that what we've sort of seen as adoption has grown over the last, say, month, even as we've added new assets and people have started trading more, is that there's still a lot of friction, even in error generation, for example. Right? Like transaction goes wrong, like literally the other day. And I'll blame sleep deprivation, but it was probably a bit of idiocy. It took me seven transactions to actually send some tokens to someone because they were locked. I had debt against them, and I kept getting. It was like out of gas.
00:31:14.676 - 00:31:53.348, Speaker D: And I was like, okay, more gas. Then it was through just a random error at me and I had to go back and work out. And this is the thing that I helped to build, right? So I think we can kind of say let's build better interfaces. But if the interface just throws a generic, sorry, error at you, it makes it really hard for the average user who's coming in, who maybe doesn't quite understand exactly what the interaction is. So I think that there's even some very low level infrastructure things that are still missing that we need to be able to pass up error reporting and error messages and really kind of graceful errors, which sounds like obvious, but it's still a pretty big problem.
00:31:53.434 - 00:31:55.270, Speaker A: I think you should check out near.
00:31:59.640 - 00:32:29.264, Speaker B: Mike. I think one of the things I would like to see is better on off ramps into and out of fiat. In my case, I've been getting paid and died, like I said, for pretty much two years now, ever since we released the alpha version. So if the current die, the single collateral die, is the beta. PSi was the alpha. There was no market for it. It was just the foundation would trade you back ether when you needed it.
00:32:29.264 - 00:33:26.820, Speaker B: Right? But even before then, living in Argentina with inflation of almost 50%, I always chose crypto to get paid ever since, I think maybe 2013. So started being bitcoin, then ether, then die, and always trying to convert that into fiat was always a problem. I'm not that idealistic to think that it's going to like the day when we pay for our coffee with bitcoin or with any other token. I know that it can be done, but I don't think that that's one of the major concerns. For example, for me, it's been fine just trading crypto once a month. I get my paycheck. I change some into argentine pesos to pay my rent, groceries, everything.
00:33:26.820 - 00:34:11.090, Speaker B: And then whatever else, either I loan it on compound, on Dharma and DyDX. I buy a little bit of crypto just to speculate. But for me, that's been good enough, just doing like one off ramp into fiat per month. But I think there's still a lot of ways we can do better. Even here in the States, there's pretty much only wire or going to coinbase and trading into USDC, into Dai. And I think if we can somewhat figure out how to get lower fees on that, we can also maybe increase adoption for it.
00:34:13.320 - 00:34:53.856, Speaker E: I think for compound one thing that would be two things that would be super meaningful to us. One is cross chain asset transfers. We can only support ethereum based assets. Like, you go down coin market cap on tokens, not very far, and you start getting the pretty small cap, very illiquid assets. So being able to support the more liquid, biggest assets would be huge. Also, privacy. There's lots of different approaches now to solving privacy for on chain transactions, but that would also be really huge for onboarding lots of different types of users, I think.
00:34:54.038 - 00:34:56.320, Speaker B: Do you have a wrap BTC?
00:34:56.660 - 00:35:12.244, Speaker E: We don't support it yet. We said that we would add it. We have version two coming out in a matter of weeks. And we said we would add it when WrAp BTC reaches $2 million of wrap. But it hasn't reached it because more assets have been tokenized. It reached it because bitcoin keeps going.
00:35:12.282 - 00:35:14.470, Speaker D: Up in USD value.
00:35:15.000 - 00:35:19.530, Speaker E: But, yeah, we want to. I mean, we hope that's a success. We're certainly cheering for it.
00:35:20.380 - 00:35:33.864, Speaker F: Hello. Okay. Yeah, I'm pretty happy with the state of Ethereum. I think that there's been a lot of good progress. I think some of our biggest issues right now are probably related to UX. It's not that expensive to make a transaction on Ethereum.
00:35:33.912 - 00:35:34.172, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:34.226 - 00:36:06.288, Speaker F: Making a trade on Uniswap is $0.02. Opening a CDP is probably a few cents. So I think I'm excited to see people continue to push the boundaries of UX. And I think that probably includes account management and private key management. I guess another area, I think that we probably need a killer DaP, like when cryptokitties came out and kind of took over the network and everything. Kind of all the gas prices went up really high. I think we need another one of those, but probably on a layer two solution.
00:36:06.288 - 00:36:51.270, Speaker F: So people have assets in some sort of game or some sort of DAP, but it's running on an l two solution and it has the UX of a really high quality website today. Another thing that I'm really hoping for and actually something I'm working on is price oracles just sort of improving. I want to improve uniswap as a price oracle so that people can kind of trust it. Right now, you can check the price on uniswap, but you don't really know how reliable it is or how that weighs into like a historical, there's no history to, it's just like, what's the current price? And you don't know if a miner just manipulated it or not. So I think price oracles as well.
00:36:54.140 - 00:37:05.160, Speaker A: We've touched before on this, but one interesting question is how do you guys think of governance around decentralized finance.
00:37:07.760 - 00:37:52.330, Speaker F: Governance? I'm very hesitant. So I think a lot of projects implemented governance solutions. I was very hesitant to implement anything governance related into Uniswap because I felt like, I don't know, no offense to any projects that exist. I don't really know if just like voting with money is the best way. And it's not to say that it's necessarily a horrible way. I think, for example, in a proof of stake, it makes sense because you put money, you stake it, and then you can get slashed, you can get penalized, but you kind of need some sort of punishable offense. I don't know.
00:37:52.330 - 00:38:38.072, Speaker F: The way I did governance in Uniswap is basically, I can propose a new version and if people think it's better, they can migrate their liquidity over. There's some problems there, which is that it's a little bit difficult to upgrade. So if I wanted to rapidly iterate, maybe it's a little bit more difficult. But then the other trade off there, and I know actually compound has been kind of weighing the same trade off. But I guess the other side of that is that if you're creating an open source financial system and people are trusting it with their money and they're locking up money in it, maybe it shouldn't be something that can be upgraded that fast. Maybe it should require people that really opt into it and choose to move over. Yeah, I don't know.
00:38:38.072 - 00:38:53.630, Speaker F: It's kind of a difficult topic. It's something I'm still sort of thinking about a lot, but don't have any end all solutions. I think minimizing the need for governance is the best move until we figure out better ways to do it.
00:38:55.920 - 00:40:03.350, Speaker E: I think that's a fair assessment. I don't think anyone has really carved out a path towards what to me is really compelling on chain governance of a protocol. Yet I think the ideal of decentralized on chain governance is so compelling that people should definitely keep working on it. But I don't know what the right answer is for compound. One of the interesting things that we do think about for far into the future, at least on the time frame of years, is if each market that we support, if the suppliers of assets to those markets could basically use their stake of supply as voting power to decide like the interest rate models or the collateral ratios or collateral factors, or what they'll take as collateral, or how much people can borrow, things like that. So then owners of that asset could control that interest rate market on compound, make decisions around it. But certainly we'll probably getting there.
00:40:03.350 - 00:40:11.460, Speaker E: We'll decide what constraints can be voted upon, things like that. It's really hard to get to full decentralized on chain governance.
00:40:13.480 - 00:40:17.370, Speaker B: So maker governance, right?
00:40:17.820 - 00:40:18.570, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:22.140 - 00:41:13.770, Speaker B: So yeah, we've been doing on chain governance for year and a half, right. It's had its ups and downs. There's still a lot of people that own a lot of NKR. So we saw that the other day. I think with an Aragon vote as well, it's like whales can influence this kind of votes. The good thing we have with the NKR holders is that most of them that do participate, they do so religiously. It's like lately, for the past few months, once we actually started looking at modifying the interest rates, the stability fee per week, which is something we had to do to protect the peg, to get die back to one dollars.
00:41:13.770 - 00:42:07.550, Speaker B: There's almost 200 people that are very active. They participate in the community, they propose new things. But still, in the end, the barrier to actually vote on chain is still pretty complicated. You have to have control of your asset, you have to lock it up in a contract. And last week we had a vulnerability on our voting contract. The good thing is that since only like 200 people vote and they're very active, we had, I don't know, close to 200K MKR locked up in the voting contract. And in a matter of maybe 24 hours, 98% of it was removed in a good way.
00:42:07.550 - 00:42:32.304, Speaker B: It was not like people freed up their assets and they moved to the new contract. Right. We still have a couple of stragglers there, and now we have to get people to trust the contract again. Right. So we had that audited once again. We disclosed the vulnerability and now we're back on track. Right.
00:42:32.304 - 00:43:16.850, Speaker B: We had to miss one whole week of governance. The good thing is that we had the rally, we had the stability fee high enough and the peg was pretty much one. One. So there was not a lot of need to actually influence the system. But one of the things we're coming up for the next version is timed governance vote. So there's going to be certain things in the system that cannot change until certain time has passed. And I don't want to get too into the specifics of it, but I think you can look at maker governance as, I'm not going to say a success.
00:43:16.850 - 00:44:05.216, Speaker B: It's one of the big projects doing it out in the open. And anybody with any amount of MKR can come to the governance meetings every Thursday and participate. And even if they don't have enough voting power themselves, they can try to rally the community around a proposal. So eventually getting new tokens into multilateral dai or if you think the stability fee is way too high, okay, why is it? And do you have data to back it? And maybe you can get one of the big whales there voting in your favor. I think governance is actually one of the coolest things, even if it's now kind of like a dirty word. Right. Work in progress, it is always, yeah.
00:44:05.238 - 00:44:31.764, Speaker D: I mean, on some level it's pretty simple, right. We just wait for real world governance to become a solved problem and then implement that on chain. So that's kind of our plan. But at the moment, our governance model is very much like a startup. We were chatting. We're obviously a much smaller scale than maker and a lot of the projects out there. So it's still very experimental.
00:44:31.764 - 00:44:55.932, Speaker D: And that gives us a lot of leeway to kind of be experimental about how we do things and iterate and kind of move as quickly as possible. And so the approach that we've taken is we're a startup. We debate things internally. We debate things externally with some of our stakeholders, but we haven't implemented any kind of on chain governance, but that's not, I guess, sustainable in the long term. So at some point you need to make a decision and start to cut some bridges.
00:44:55.996 - 00:44:56.272, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:56.326 - 00:45:24.840, Speaker D: So there's certain things that we can upgrade in the contracts that we want to not be able to upgrade. There's certain things like the oracles that we want to decentralize so as soon as we have viable decentralized solutions, we'll move to that. So I think for us, it's kind of an iterative process of trying to kind of move away from centralization, but you need to balance it with usability. And if we had just put out the first version of the contracts and said we're done, that would have been a pretty abject failure.
00:45:27.740 - 00:46:34.530, Speaker C: Yeah, it's not something that I have to focus on with the stage of my projects at, but one thing I've been curious about is when that identity piece will start to kick off. Facebook brought identity to the web, and I think that helped you to kind of link one person to kind of one account largely. And what is going to bring the notion of a person into all of these protocols such that you can have kind of one person, one vote? Will there be some kind of combination of the way you speak, the way you type, the way you look, the way you walk, generating some kind of kind of essence of your digital self, and that will allow you to kind of communicate to that, to a protocol anonymously? I'm not sure what that looks like, but it strikes me that without identity, most governance is a plutocracy, and that if you're super rich, you can sway the vote. And as we've read in history, that plutocracies generally don't pan out that well over time. So those are just some observations, but not something I'm focused on right now.
00:46:36.580 - 00:47:50.410, Speaker A: Yeah. One thing we're trying to figure out is can we pretty much combine plutocracy and meritocracy in kind of one system where plutocracy provides oversight over a meritocracy, which you would think right now Ethereum is meritocracy, but there's no clear guidelines how it works and there's no oversight from kind of people who actually are heavily invested in Ethereum and they do not have any levels on top of it. It's like figuring out a mechanics how to merge those two things. I think maker and kind of doing that by having maker token owners and then maker kind of company or companies providing input to the stock and holders, which is like what they think is the reason. So combining two things I think is very important. So actually, do we have any questions in the audience? Does anybody want to ask this very knowledgeable gentleman? All right, well, I have one more question. What are the hacks that you done pretty much to work around infrastructure failures? And this is very like, I have deep knowledge to access.
00:47:53.980 - 00:48:44.970, Speaker C: Yeah. So pertaining to the problem I was bringing up earlier. I'm really excited about graph protocol because they kind of came up with this insight that the state of Ethereum may be kind of tens of gigabytes, but the amount of data that people might want out of that state could run to kind of many terabytes. So a good example of this is Etherscan, which is a kind of central point of failure in the protocol. It has the list of all the token addresses, the token names and the token logos, and it has ingested the Ethereum blockchain, stepped through all the state transitions and come up with token balances. And this turns out to be like a really, really difficult problem. But there's also similar problems for lots of other protocols where you're wishing to kind of understand the underlying state of Ethereum by knowing what's on the blockchain and knowing what changed and then presenting that data to an application.
00:48:44.970 - 00:49:02.880, Speaker C: And so there have been lots of kind of hacks and little things that I've used to get access to data, but I'm very excited about the graph protocol team specifically because that is their kind of raise on Detroit, that is their focus, which is how can we allow developers and people to see what's going on. I think that's pretty exciting.
00:49:05.860 - 00:49:47.740, Speaker D: This is actually something we're planning to implement. So we're talking to scale about essentially using an l two chain to push oracle information into the chain as a way of not having, I guess, fairly high latency for the number of ticks at the moment, price feed updates kind of once every three to five minutes. And so what we wanted to do is push kind of subsecond price ticks into an l two chain, which then can be read off the main chain, which will make kind of the granularity of pricing a lot better. So that's something we're planning to do that obviously is kind of necessitated by just block times, right, and block propagation.
00:49:50.260 - 00:51:25.932, Speaker B: So, hacks, I will tell you, since somebody mentioned cryptokitties back when I was still writing the Oracle software, I think I had put a hard cap of no more than maybe 40 gigaway per transaction, just because there was this method where if the transaction would not go through after a couple of minutes, then it would try again with higher gas, higher gas. And then I said, I'm going to put a hard cap on it just because I don't know, something could happen. And I want to eventually send all the ether in the account to pay for gas, right? And then one day the oracle stopped, like, the individual feeds stopped working and they were going down one by one. And what happened is that cryptokitties was on and then we started seeing gas prices in the hundreds of gigawatts, something that I thought was never going to be. It's like, I thought, okay, 40 gigaways is going to be enough for everybody, right? And just, we started modifying the software. Essentially, all we did was add an extra zero to it and say, okay, maybe 400 gigaway, it's going to be enough for everybody, right? And trying to get everybody on the phone, like people from all around the world that are the oracle providers to update the system before enough of the fees went down so that the price wouldn't be inaccessible. Because if it is, then you really cannot do any operation on the system.
00:51:25.932 - 00:52:04.728, Speaker B: You cannot draw die, you cannot pay it back, just because we don't know what the price of the collateral is. Right. So I just remember that one. It's also one of the things that is going to be most interesting in the future, the future of the oracles and on chain only information. Maybe with uniswap, I think we're still a little bit off there. But no, there was something there. I think it happened to somebody using nuo that they had put an option or something for.
00:52:04.728 - 00:52:09.390, Speaker B: I think it was a link token and they got liquidated because.
00:52:11.760 - 00:52:14.956, Speaker F: Not a very powerful on chain oracle right now.
00:52:14.978 - 00:52:31.308, Speaker B: No, exactly. Right now, because there's not enough volume and not enough liquidity, you can actually swing the prices for very little money. But the guys from Marvel protocol, they built polaris, that it has, like, checkpoints.
00:52:31.404 - 00:52:36.230, Speaker F: It's better than just using the raw contracts. But hopefully what I'm going to be working on will make it even better.
00:52:37.960 - 00:52:39.252, Speaker B: I want to read about that.
00:52:39.386 - 00:52:40.630, Speaker F: I haven't written anything.
00:52:43.080 - 00:53:20.236, Speaker E: The class of problems that come to mind when you ask that question for us are mostly also oracle issues, I think so. I agree with everything that's been said here. One thing that doesn't directly answer your question, but I'm really excited about is in version two of compound in a matter of weeks, keep your eye out. One thing we're doing is today you supply ether into compound and your ether is earning interest. You can withdraw it whenever you want. In version two, you get compound ether. We're calling c ether, which represents your balance in compound.
00:53:20.236 - 00:53:46.650, Speaker E: And now you could move this to cold storage. You could split it amongst many other assets, many other wallets. You could use it to create a liquidity pool on uniswap. You can start to rehypothecate this. What has been called like super liquid collateral around to different systems while continuing to earn interest in compound. And I think this is kind of like a hack on the collateral system that could get really interesting.
00:53:48.220 - 00:54:17.910, Speaker F: I would avoid using the word rehypothecation. It's a little bit of a different answer here, but I don't really see any infrastructure failure. I think that the fact that uniswap exists and the fact that I was able to create it is kind of a testament to the incredible power of Ethereum and not really, I don't know, it doesn't feel like a failure. It feels like an incredible success. I don't know. Yeah.
00:54:22.590 - 00:54:28.842, Speaker A: What do you guys think about smart contract based accounts instead of users just having direct private keys?
00:54:28.906 - 00:55:03.890, Speaker F: I think they're pretty cool. I think nosis safe is the first. I think they're pretty cool. Right? What do we think? Sorry, what do we think of smart contract based accounts instead of just user generated accounts? Well, in Ethereum 2.0 there'll be account abstraction. It will all be the same where you will be able to make your accounts have code, arbitrary code in them. But up until then, on the current system, well, it's unclear exactly how it will be implemented.
00:55:03.890 - 00:55:14.860, Speaker F: So it might be anyway. But for now I do think that they're great. I think that Nosisafe is a cool start. I've heard of some others that are coming out. Yeah, I think they're cool.
00:55:19.730 - 00:56:05.002, Speaker B: Yeah. Thinking about what we are building right now, most of the new system for MCD is pretty much going to have to be used via proxies just because there's so much stuff. You want to do everything atomically right now. It's like you want to put ether and you want to open a CDP and you want to draw a die. You want to put that into some other defi project. You want to do everything atomically, so you pretty much need proxies for that. And then just one step further, you want to have that be controlled by probably a smart contract account that can do that and a lot more.
00:56:05.002 - 00:56:53.180, Speaker B: So I think we're going to see that happening plenty right now. Even in this version, the current version of SCD that we have, I think like 80%, maybe more of all cdps are actually owned by proxies and not individual accounts. The thing is that that also leads to a little bit of a UI problem. Sometimes it's not as simple as using software with metamask. Maybe so creates another level of indirection, but at least if we can get a little bit better of that I do think that everything eventually is going to be like you said, once we have, I thought there was going to be a count abstraction in Ethereum one.
00:56:54.350 - 00:56:57.120, Speaker F: No one knows what's up with them, but 2.0 will definitely.
00:57:01.890 - 00:57:02.446, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:02.548 - 00:57:58.160, Speaker D: I think to add to what Hayden said, it's easy to kind of complain about some of the rough edges of Ethereum. It's not done yet, but if you use it regularly, if you're interacting with Ethereum and various protocols on a daily basis, it's fucking amazing. The fact that it even exists at all is incredible. Every day I'm doing something and I'm just astounded, right, that it's even a thing that exists in the world. So it's easy to kind of look at some of the issues that we see, but the things that are already there and the things that are going to kind of emerge over the next few years are just kind of astounding. So I think we need to be sort of measured in what we say about things and just kind of be careful about trying to poke too many holes, because there's a lot to be happy about as well.
00:57:59.890 - 00:59:18.518, Speaker C: Just for folks who may not be aware of what a kind of smart contract wallet is, or a basic wallet, this is something I've been researching an awful lot. So a typical wallet is when you download a kind of piece of software and you have your public key and your private key. So metamask might be an example where the private key is hidden away from you, encrypted by a password, or you say a wallet like trustwallet, where you're given a kind of password and the private key again is stored on the phone public key. Is there a smart wallet? Is this idea that what you're going to engage in is I'm going to store my funds in a smart contract that is living on Ethereum, and so that this smart contract will be the kind of holder of my funds, and then I can assign keys to different devices. So one could be your phone, one could be a web based, could be a browser, and this is a kind of next step in wallet technology in that it's going to give people more options. So two of the companies that are pushing on this really hard are Gnosis, who've done a kind of formally verified set of smart contracts that are open source, and they've built client apps for Android, iOS and Chrome. And then there's a company called Argent Europe based that are also doing a slightly different design of smart contract based wallet.
00:59:18.518 - 01:00:29.530, Speaker C: And so the kind of number one support complaint that my ether wallet trust and my crypto have gone through is how do I reset my password? And so obviously that's a huge issue in terms of usability, in terms of people. A lot of people have lost access to their money or they bought tokens, particularly as this bull run is returning, you're starting to see people wanting to get access to those funds again or see what they're worth, and they're going to be sorely disappointed because they will have forgotten their password and that will be that. And if that's going to be the state of ethereum continuing forwards, it means that kind of capital is going to accrue and pool in centralized services like Coinbase, which server a great role, which basically allowed my dad to unlock the bitcoin that I sent him six years ago. I'm extremely appreciative for Coinbase because my dad's really happy about that. But smart contract wallets point to a direction I'm really excited about, which is that we can have password recovery systems that can be reasonably solid for different levels of capital. So if someone just has $1,000, there's a certain level of security, there's $10,000, there's more security, there's $100,000. Honestly, you can jog on and learn to use a ledger.
01:00:29.530 - 01:00:58.860, Speaker C: But my point is that the direction of smart wallets is very exciting to me because it points to a place where lots of people can access financial services. They don't have to become super experts on managing personal security. They can have some kind of reset mechanism which isn't dependent on a company. And that, I think, is a great infrastructure that over time could really help a lot of people hold charge of their funds. That's the trend I'm seeing and something I'm investigating a lot.
01:01:01.710 - 01:01:52.280, Speaker A: Yeah, we're actually building this kind of stuff on the protocol level, where all accounts are contracts, all contracts are accounts, and all access is done through access keys. So you can always kind of add, remove, program them, et cetera. And yeah, we actually have a blog post about this idea of progressive security where you start with like, well, I don't actually care. It's like $2 cryptokitty. Why do I need to deal with all those blockchain pass phrases, et cetera? Now? But then one day, one day, but then you move it to cold storage, you just swap the keys, remove old one, plug in new one, et cetera. All right, well, that was an awesome panel. I mean, please to give a round of applause for our panel close.
