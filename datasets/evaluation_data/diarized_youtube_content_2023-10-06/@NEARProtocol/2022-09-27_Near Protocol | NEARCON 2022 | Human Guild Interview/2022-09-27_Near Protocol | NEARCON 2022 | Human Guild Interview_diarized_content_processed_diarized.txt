00:00:00.410 - 00:00:00.960, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.050 - 00:00:14.720, Speaker B: I'm with the legendary Sasha here. I'm sure many of you already know Sasha, but Sasha, just for the people living under a rock, can you just tell them who you are and what you're up to?
00:00:15.170 - 00:00:46.102, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, I've been working near ecosystem since beginning, since August of 2018. Originally I was the only person talking to the market. I then I started incubator accelerator called Open Web Collective. Last year I was one of the first offshoots out of the near called Human Guild. So we started to focus more and more on incubations of gaming on near natively. And so we are right now in a gaming arcade inside of New Yorkon where we have 16 or so games presenting their playable versions to gamers.
00:00:46.246 - 00:00:58.560, Speaker B: What would you say to people that are interested in near or that want to build games on near? For all the game developers that would like to build, do you have any words you'd want to say to them or anything?
00:00:59.010 - 00:01:37.434, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say it's very challenging because there's a lot to figure out. How to go to market in a web3 native way, how to build sustainable economy, how to build a balance of gameplay and economy. But the important piece is that there is a lot less competition than in web two gaming. So if people build something useful, then they'll get a lot of attention. I think in near ecosystem, people are really waiting for applications and games to launch. And another piece is that we're trying to instill the collaborative mindset for founders. We want founders to teach founders similarly how when nearer was starting, it was very collaborative with other layer ones, L2.
00:01:37.434 - 00:01:52.590, Speaker C: So there's a lot of cross collaboration in terms of approaches. So we're trying to do that in human guild at least. So if you're a founder considering building a game on near, talk to us. We want to integrate you with the rest of the community and you'll be figuring things out together.
00:01:52.740 - 00:01:57.090, Speaker B: Sweet, man. What makes you optimistic about web3 and near?
00:01:57.160 - 00:02:21.050, Speaker C: Sasha, why someone would build on near? I think it comes down to two things when it comes to gaming, usability and finality. Usability means you can bring mass market audience into your games. Finality means that you get faster response from blockchain and so you can build more real time use cases, which expands number of use cases available to game developers.
00:02:21.470 - 00:02:26.300, Speaker B: All right, here's a fun one for you. Sasha, what is web3?
00:02:27.070 - 00:03:04.920, Speaker C: I think web3 is more of a philosophy. Different people think about web3 very differently. It has some problems with branding because it's so general. But I think Web three is an opportunity to redo the Internet, right, with the servers being available to the public as opposed to kind of locked in corporate servers of like Facebook and Google, the guys who kind of control the current iteration of the Internet. So I think web3 is a digital property rights. It's opportunity for developers, investors, founders, users to work on a platform that would not change rules for them.
00:03:05.850 - 00:03:10.920, Speaker B: Sasha, do you have any tips for people to get the most out of web3?
00:03:11.290 - 00:03:38.270, Speaker C: I think the important piece is to start trying different applications and different games. I think the real way you build intuition for the web3 space is not by reading about it, but actually trying applications. So I suggest anyone who is interested in web3 is try applications, try games if you're a gamer or other applications that will allow you to build intuition for the space, then you figure out what do you get out of web3 in terms of what personally to you is appealing.
00:03:39.730 - 00:03:42.400, Speaker B: Sasha, thank you so much for your time, man. I appreciate you.
00:03:44.610 - 00:03:48.900, Speaker A: You our channel.
