00:00:00.250 - 00:00:43.050, Speaker A: Hi there, everybody. I'm glad that people have come to see this panel because we have a very exciting panel for you. So I'm Joy McKnight. I'm editor of the banker publication, which is part of the Financial Times Group. And I have some fantastic expert panelists with me today. Right beside me I have Nuno Lima de Luz, who's senior associate in Portugal at international firm Quattro Casas and president of the Portuguese Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies association. Next to him I have Josh Klayman, who is us head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets, as well as co head of global technology sector at law firm Linklators.
00:00:43.050 - 00:01:37.020, Speaker A: And next to her I have Mary Beth Buchanan, strategic advisor to the near foundation, as well as sitting on the board of the Cardano foundation and has previously been a federal prosecutor and also a partner at a very large law firm. So it's a very legal heavy panel, which is a good thing. As we're discussing the EU's markets in crypto assets regulation, or mika, which entered into force in June 2023 and is currently going through a consultation process with member states often hailed as a world first in the regulation of crypto assets. So from the bankers readership position, I. E. The banks, this framework is very welcomed and is something they've been waiting for before they could really get actively engaged with the crypto assets. And obviously many of them have been doing some things on the side.
00:01:37.020 - 00:02:43.620, Speaker A: But the big institutions have really needed this regulatory clarity so that they feel comfortable that they won't be on the receiving end of regulatory fines. However, what is clear is the EU's new framework approaches crypto asset services. From the standpoint of the traditional market structure, it draws heavily on existing rules, such as the markets and financial instruments directive, or MiFID, among others, to create a market design for financial instruments. And it applies a regulatory principle of same activities, same risk, same rules, which is intended to level the playing field for service providers. So banks and other intermediaries and financial market infrastructures that require supervision are all applauding the new regulatory framework, or at least think it's a step in the right direction. And Nuno, I'm going to pose the first question to you. Well, this is all well and good, but then what does Mika bring to the crypto community? What does it include? And then what does it leave out?
00:02:44.630 - 00:03:38.866, Speaker B: Well, thank you. It was a very good introduction. So the markets in crypto assets regulation brings a lot to the table. It was intended the way it was designed initially was to tackle the Libra DM issue. Yeah. So basically the way that met wanted to proceed with and to launch an art, an asset reference token as the way they intended, that was a way and could bring a little bit of disruption to the financial stability and the monetary policy throughout the world.
00:03:38.968 - 00:03:42.610, Speaker A: Yeah. So the central banks, they made that announcement.
00:03:42.950 - 00:03:43.458, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:03:43.544 - 00:03:44.386, Speaker A: They were on it.
00:03:44.488 - 00:04:55.018, Speaker B: Imagine the whole community and the users that are within Facebook getting a token that they could easily use to pay for services. There are a lot of users for Facebook. So, yeah, that was the biggest motivation for the European Union to launch this regulation in our jurisdiction. So basically, Bika tried to tackle that issue first. Basically it's constructed as a way to regulate asset reference tokens and emoney tokens, typically the stable coins that we know nowadays, USDC, USDT, whatever. So that was the main focus of this regulation. And after that, because as every law must be, it needs to be general and applicable to a lot of different subjects, and not just only for a specific target, they've built other things around that.
00:04:55.018 - 00:06:48.542, Speaker B: So nowadays we have a good framework that regulates the crypto asset service providers, how they provide their services, what type of services are comprised in that regulation, and the requirements that they need to have in order to provide those kind of services. I think it will be a very good framework and under the typical Brussels effect that the regulation in the European Union has throughout the world, I think it will be a major landmark and be replicated. The basic things that Mika says will be replicated in other jurisdictions. But yeah, in terms of what does it include and what it leaves out of that regulation, it includes how crypto asset service provider must register the needs that they have, the requirements, let's say, for example, the need to separate funds from clients, from the users and their own funds. Well, FTX could have been tackled if Mika was already into force and FTX was registered in the European Union, that could have been prevented, let's say. So, yeah, it has a lot of requirements that provide some kind of clarity to the end user and it's all about consumer protection in the end of the day. So it brings a lot into the table on that side.
00:06:48.542 - 00:08:00.440, Speaker B: Well, it leaves out the nfts because it's a very complex issue to tackle because nfTs, you must see the underlying asset that is being represented by an NFT. Nowadays it's mostly IP, IP content or IP assets that are being represented as an NFT. But an NFT, an ERC 721 or 1155 has a lot of complexity. And so nfts were left aside and decentralized DeFi projects were also left out of this regulation because it's also a very complex issue to tackle. So, yeah, basically nfts on that side. Real non fungible tokens are left out of Mika and Defi. But I think it will be revisited in the near future as long as the legislator, the lawmakers, the regulators start to understand how everything works.
00:08:01.050 - 00:08:04.982, Speaker A: Yeah. Because there's these different phases of consultation that's still.
00:08:05.116 - 00:08:06.120, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:08:07.530 - 00:08:08.082, Speaker A: Excellent.
00:08:08.146 - 00:08:11.034, Speaker B: We'll have some time to do that.
00:08:11.152 - 00:08:20.490, Speaker A: Mary Beth, I was going to bring yourself in now. So what are the pros and cons for small and medium sized companies or projects?
00:08:21.390 - 00:09:33.730, Speaker C: First, I'd like to thank all of the hardy participants out there who enjoyed the great party last night and are still here, and you're awake. So thank you for being here, because this is definitely one of the highlights of the conference, the Mika legislation. There are definitely pros and cons, and I would say the absolute biggest pro is that with this expansive legislation, the European Union is sending a loud and clear message that crypto assets are. You know, this might not seem like a big thing, but it is huge because so many businesses that operate globally in the crypto asset space are always wondering, are we welcome? Are we not welcome? What's the law? If we come here, are we going to have a hard time operating? So to have this legislation is a welcome. Matt, bring your business to the European Union. The second major benefit is the passportability of the license. And again, another huge game changer.
00:09:33.730 - 00:10:30.754, Speaker C: Having been general counsel to a european crypto asset business, I can tell you that it is really hard, or was really hard before Mika, to try to decide where we want to do business across Europe. And there's very little distance, obviously, the countries are so close, yet the rules are so different. And without having the ability to passport, companies have to be really careful about deciding where they want to do business. And it's no small business decision. And these decisions involve the commitment of significant resources, in some cases, the commitment to actually physically move a business and have certain employees to be present in certain jurisdictions. And these decisions aren't made lightly, and they're obviously made at the board level. And so they take a long time to make those decisions.
00:10:30.754 - 00:11:22.386, Speaker C: And then in some cases, even after a particular business model has been vetted and the company moves into a jurisdiction, the deal flow isn't there. And then they realize that they put a lot of resources into a particular country, and they're going to have to change course. So passportability. Number one. I would say the major cons for a small to medium business would be the increased compliance burdens. So some of the bigger institutions, they've already had these programs in place, and so this isn't a significant thing for them. But for a small business to have to certify that each particular crypto asset is appropriate for a particular customer and that the compliance programs are adequate to protect that customer, that's a pretty high burden.
00:11:22.386 - 00:12:11.334, Speaker C: And if the company fails to meet that burden, the penalty is twelve and a half percent profits. I mean, huge. That's three times bigger than a GDPR violation. So this is something that they really need to get right and put the proper procedures in place to make sure that they can meet that burden. Something that nuno did mention. One of the downsides is that there are some activities that are left out, the NFTs and DeFi activities. And I think he's correct that over the next year or two, there still will be some significant debate about particular defi activities and whether some DeFi activities may get swept in.
00:12:11.334 - 00:12:33.342, Speaker C: And so I think that the final word on this probably has not yet been written, and we'll have to see what happens there. But overall, it's a strong message for crypto assets across the European Union and hopefully other countries around the world, including the US, will take a page out of this book.
00:12:33.476 - 00:12:48.740, Speaker A: Well, I have to say, you did a great segue into the next question, which is for Josh. And so the, how does Mika, for example, and what's happening in terms of the EU, how does that compare to the regulatory environment in the US?
00:12:49.590 - 00:13:03.222, Speaker D: So I don't think that the US has frequently been accused of providing clarity for digital assets regulation, unless you speak with. So that's one difference.
00:13:03.356 - 00:13:03.702, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:03.756 - 00:13:11.382, Speaker D: But I think part of that is because rather than having a statute or agreement of some sort, we have case law.
00:13:11.436 - 00:13:11.606, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:11.628 - 00:13:16.630, Speaker D: And the case law has grown up in different sorts of ways. And we have principles based laws.
00:13:16.710 - 00:13:16.906, Speaker A: Now.
00:13:16.928 - 00:13:40.846, Speaker D: We do have statutes like the 33 act, the Securities act or the Exchange act, the 34 act, and so on. But we have lots of regulators that overlap. They have overlapping jurisdiction. And I think people are pretty familiar with that. Now, the well worn test, the Howey test, and tests about whether something looks like a note that is a security. Right. The Reeves test, family resemblance tests, which are lesser known.
00:13:40.846 - 00:14:21.306, Speaker D: But I think what I would say is the regulatory perimeter, the concept that something would be outside of the regulatory perimeter is kind of foreign to our regulators in the US because so much is focused on how is something offered, how is something marketed, how is something sold? So looking at the activities as well, what this means is that while under Mika, NFTs and DeFi are expressly left out, the SEC has made clear that NFTs can be, in their view, securities and has had some recent settlements with impact theory and stoner cats.
00:14:21.418 - 00:14:21.790, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:21.860 - 00:15:12.810, Speaker D: And with respect to DeFi, we've seen proposed rule changes that would expand the definition of exchange to try and capture aspects of DeFi that currently aren't captured under existing law. We've also seen courts within the US really grappling with these issues and sometimes pushing back on the regulators in ways that I don't think the regulators necessarily expected. Also, with respect to DeFi, you may be aware of the recent private action that was attempted to be brought against uniswap labs where the court there, which happens to be the same judge that's deciding SEC v. Coinbase, and that was the judge for the Tornado cash action by treasury in the US, where that judge said, actually the SEC hasn't really, we're not there yet. Congress needs to act. Right. This is a matter for Congress.
00:15:12.810 - 00:15:34.614, Speaker D: And that's something that I think a lot of people in the US have been saying for a while. Of course the Congress has its own challenges. I would just plant a seed about something that I think is coming down the pike, which is the same regulators that are very concerned about digital assets in the US are the same ones that are now very worried about.
00:15:34.812 - 00:15:35.222, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:35.276 - 00:16:19.246, Speaker D: And both of these industries have incredible promise and as the regulators will remind know, attendant potentially serious risks. And I think within the US, there's an increased focus on national security. Actually just did a podcast about this. But why I say this is that there have been some things that have come along over the years and they've not been fully developed. The US Department of Commerce is not one of those agencies that really comes to mind in our space. We think SEC, CFTC, FinCEn, et cetera. But actually there are some things in the works that could expand the kind of KYC, AML, CFT sanctions stuff to infrastructure providers, like infrastructure as a service providers.
00:16:19.246 - 00:16:46.510, Speaker D: And if you think about our industry, if you're not a money services business, you're not a money transmitter. You may say, I'm just infrastructure. Just keep this in mind. You'll also see if you saw Biden's executive order on AI. I know that's a little bit outside of this, but I'm telling you, these agencies are all coming together. There's a really high focus on national security as well as competition, and the Department of Commerce is going to play a key role in that, too. So I would just say, keep your eyes peeled for the Department of Commerce.
00:16:46.510 - 00:16:51.646, Speaker D: And, yeah, there are lots of differences between the US and Mika, but I.
00:16:51.668 - 00:17:21.420, Speaker A: Have to say, that's so interesting. So thanks for raising that, something that never really occurred to me either. Mary Beth, I was going to ask the next question to you, which, know, all the things I said at the beginning of the banks and the big institutions now have the ability to actually engage with crypto assets, et cetera, under think. Do you think what I said was actually true in the terms of, do you think that it provides that framework for the big institutions to get involved, and then do you think they'll all go rushing in?
00:17:21.790 - 00:18:52.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that the big banks are really the true winners here with Mika, because the crypto asset businesses that are not financial institutions have to apply for authorization to operate under Mika, whereas the banks, as financial institutions and persons, do not have to apply for authorization, but they do have to meet the notice provisions. So they have to notify their home regulator that they intend to offer crypto assets, and they have to file the white paper. But that white paper doesn't have to be approved by anyone, and of course, they have to comply with all of the compliance requirements. But for a big bank, they already have extensive compliance procedures, they have anti money laundering programs, they have terrorist financing programs, they have sanction programs, and so they're already ahead of the game. The other area is that they already have been segregating customer accounts. And this might not seem like a big deal, but for a small crypto asset business, many of them have been operating with an omnibus wallet, and they were not segregating customer funds in separate accounts. So for some of those businesses, even just doing that is a hurdle.
00:18:52.194 - 00:19:30.686, Speaker C: But for the banks, they're already so far out ahead of the game. And I think that the banks, particularly in the US, have been sitting on the sidelines realizing that there's a lot of opportunity in offering crypto assets, and they have been wanting to do it. But because of the lack of clarity, the banks have not gotten into the game, and they're not offering crypto assets, and so their customers are kind of being left out. But here, now that they've gotten the green light, they will be able to offer those assets to their bigger and smaller financial clients.
00:19:30.878 - 00:19:34.180, Speaker A: Excellent. Nino, do you think the banks will be rushing in?
00:19:34.790 - 00:20:46.570, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been seeing a lot of movement on that area. Even in Portugal, we have clients that are moving towards that direction. This is a boat that has set sail a long time ago. So there's no way to circumvent or to ignore this space of the digital assets and crypto assets for that part. Yeah. I think that, as Mary Beth said, this regulatory package was basically built to allow for financial institutions to come on board and the tradfi to come on board on this new reality and the process of getting on board in this new industry. It's much more simpler for the tradfi industry because all that compliance and structure that they have facilitates this onboarding, because we can't forget that Mika is basically constructed as a way to protect the consumer, the end user.
00:20:46.570 - 00:22:47.582, Speaker B: Well, tradfi is typically, we have some issues sometimes, but it's basically constructed to give that confidence and to be a trustable environment for the investors and the end users. So I think that Mika allows for that process to be much more clearer and to bring that level playing field, as you said, to the whole industry on that side. But I wanted to say as well that to pick up on what Mary Beth said, that, well, this will be very harsh to smaller projects to come on board because the requirements are very burdensome for smaller projects. And everyone will need to address if they are on a starting point, if they are really a crypto asset service provider under the legal definition, and then how they can tackle all the requirements that Mika brings. And I think that a lot of M and a movements will come on board where big traditional web two, web one corporations will try to acquire or to include or to bring on board some projects that are still developing, that want to develop these type of products. So, yeah, to give a much shorter answer to your question, yeah, I think that the banks and the tradfi industry will get on board now because they have the legal clarity and it's not traveling on uncharted waters now.
00:22:47.636 - 00:23:25.706, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. Well, I just wanted to close because it's a bit of a shame because we only have like two minutes left, but I just wanted to close with the question that was posed as the topic of this panel, which is like, is it enough to entice crypto builders, the crypto builders, to come to the EU? My other question was, has the EU really stolen a march on other jurisdictions? And back to your point about you expect it to be replicated in other jurisdictions, but does it include the whole community? Will it entice the crypto builders?
00:23:25.898 - 00:24:21.182, Speaker B: Well, to be very summary, to summarize everything. Yeah, I think it will. It is enough to entice crypto builders. It provides a lot of legal clarity and foreseeability for the future on that side. So I think it will entice the crypto builders to build more and to build with more clarity on what they can build or not. One of the pillars of Mika was also to allow to have new sorts of new ways to finance the way that you do some kind of business. So it was one of the pillars, and the European Union and the European Commission addressed that.
00:24:21.182 - 00:24:40.040, Speaker B: So doing icos or initial crypto offerings is one of the ways that Mika tries to abridge that. So I think it will be very good to build more and build better in that sense.
00:24:40.890 - 00:24:47.334, Speaker A: Josh, we have yes or no? Almost time. You think it will?
00:24:47.452 - 00:25:16.062, Speaker D: I mean, yes, I think Mika has incentivized builders to come, but I think that's also just because, as Maryabad said, it's a welcome. And so, you know, there's talk about Mika, too, and other things that will come along, but I think really, builders want to build, and so if there's a jurisdiction that is not making it literally onerous for them and potentially riskier than it should be, builders are going to build.
00:25:16.196 - 00:25:18.938, Speaker A: Excellent. Yes or no, Marybeth?
00:25:19.034 - 00:25:27.766, Speaker C: Yes, it's technology agnostic, and it's clear that they're not regulating the technology. So, yes, I agree. The builders will come.
00:25:27.868 - 00:25:37.380, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, thank you so much, Mary Beth, Josh, Nuno, I thought it was a fantastic panel, and thanks so much for our audience for braving and coming to watch it. Thank you.
