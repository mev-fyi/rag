00:00:00.330 - 00:01:02.638, Speaker A: Now that you're up to speed on what near is and how it works, you're almost ready to try it out for yourself. To begin interacting with the near platform and its blossoming ecosystem of decentralized applications, you'll first need to get your hands on a near wallet. Much like a wallet you might use to hold your cash, cards and identity documents, your near wallet is used to securely manage your digital identity and assets on the near blockchain. As a non custodial, web based application, the official near wallet gives you full control over your assets, allowing you to earn, create and play without restrictions. First time using cryptocurrencies? Don't worry, Nier is designed to be super simple to use. Think PayPal combined with Apple's App Store, albeit without the corporate titans pulling the strings to create your wallet, head over to wallet near, where you will be able to register an account using your email address. You'll then be free to manage your tokens and digital collectibles and explore the range of defi apps, games, NFT collections, and more.
00:01:02.638 - 00:01:41.740, Speaker A: Built on Nier, it's also the gateway to the near staking system, which allows you to stake your Nier coins with your validator of choice. By staking, you'll not only earn a generous yield on your staked balance, but you'll also be helping to secure and grow the near network. Staking your near couldn't be easier. To get started, simply load up your wallet, head over to the staking tab, choose a validator and select the amount of near to stake. After submitting your stake, your rewards will be distributed every 12 hours. For long term holders, this can be an incredibly rewarding way to utilize your idle near coins. A new world of opportunities is now what? Fingertips are you ready.
