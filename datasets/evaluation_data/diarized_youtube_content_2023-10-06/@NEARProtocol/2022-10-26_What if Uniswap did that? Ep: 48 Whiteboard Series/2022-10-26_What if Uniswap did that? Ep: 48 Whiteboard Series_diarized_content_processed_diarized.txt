00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.962, Speaker B: Well, what are you borrowing when you're flash borrowing? Well, you're borrowing one side of this, so you're actually changing the price slightly.
00:00:06.026 - 00:00:22.800, Speaker A: Yeah, you literally just say, I'm gonna drop the. But then, but then this contract can just do it themselves. They can just give everyone the minimal price. The minimal, like, whatever the price that user said, the minimum, they will be fine with it. Can just give it to that and take all the money to itself. Why doesn't do that?
00:00:23.410 - 00:00:26.402, Speaker B: That's a great question. You should ask them why their token doesn't.
00:00:26.546 - 00:00:35.540, Speaker A: No, but whatever uniswap just did that, it will always give them whatever minimal price or fail it is true.
