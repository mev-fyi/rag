I love to teach a lot and I'm also an instructor at a blockchain academy and teacher at NBA course in Brazil too. About Journals Platform it is a blockchain system. We have tools to publish it, store and explore the web3. We are using IPFs to storage the content in a decentralized way and one of the tools is the indexer. The indexer is a structure of smudge content and we have two versions of this indexer.
00:01:45.930 - 00:02:34.854, Speaker A: The first version, it's a command line interface. It focus on the technical users and make the process of deploying fast and easy using the terminal with the index, you can publish the content at web3 and you can define the keywords and search of them after. This is a picture of the indexer. I will not try to use the Internet here. The other version of the index application. It's a decentralized web application. It's published at IFFS two and with this it's easy to upload the index.
00:02:34.854 - 00:03:14.298, Speaker A: The web3 content. For the users that are non tech info, it's very easy. We communicated directly with the blockchain. No underlines, no technical engrogement. It's intuitive and we have a friendly interface interface. This is a picture of the indexer and you can only drag your zip file with your website here and index the content to search. As the other tool we have, we use this.
00:03:14.298 - 00:03:50.038, Speaker A: These tools are in the first version, it's in alpha version, very new. But after you can try to use it. The general searches is how you explore the web3.
