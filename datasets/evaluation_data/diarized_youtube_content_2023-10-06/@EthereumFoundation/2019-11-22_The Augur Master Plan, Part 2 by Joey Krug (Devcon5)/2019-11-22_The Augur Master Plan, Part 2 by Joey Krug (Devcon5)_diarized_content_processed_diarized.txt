00:00:11.690 - 00:00:44.422, Speaker A: Joey from Auger and Pantsura. And we're going to go through Auger V two and yawn. So the idea behind Auger really is to provide. Osin's actually going forward on. So, okay, so the idea behind Congress to provide universal access to tools that increase and protect wealth through finance embedding. And so this really goes back to this concept of anybody, anywhere in the world should be able to create a financial market on whatever they want. That could be anything from a horse race to soccer match, whether Trump will be impeached or the price of Tesla.
00:00:44.422 - 00:01:14.862, Speaker A: Friday closing bell. And so our mission, the way we're going to actually do that, is by creating the world's most accessible no limit betting platform. And this really goes back to when I was in middle school and I bet you on these horse races. I bet 25 to 30 races a day. And I kind of, if you're good at it, you'll actually get cut down, so your limits get reduced, and all of a sudden you can't bet very much. And that's really the problem we're trying to solve the limits problem and then the accessibility problem. So augment v one was really a proof of concept.
00:01:14.862 - 00:01:46.478, Speaker A: It wasn't really a great user experience. You had to download an app, took hours, sometimes days to sync. You actually get this kind of big landing page. You connect the wallet, you had to download metamask, and then once you got there, the markets were really wide. You couldn't really see that much. Trading page was kind of indecipherable. You just scroll down, place your bet, a bunch of text, more tech, more text, and it was a pretty bad experience.
00:01:46.478 - 00:02:15.074, Speaker A: We just wanted to prove out that it was actually possible. We were doing a lot of things. People cover super crazy. People said that it's impossible to do all this stuff. We wanted to prove that you could do it, even if it had a really bad user experience. And so the original plan was release the one that was functional but not usable, then add zero x to allow off chain trading so you can get off chain order placements, cancellations and modifications. That's really important because it allows market makers to actually market make and reprice their ods, especially in events.
00:02:15.074 - 00:02:52.770, Speaker A: Move quickly, then add die, add maker. And the reason for that is if you're betting an e, you need to be confident on the EtH price, up or down over a time window in the event you're betting, which is really difficult. And then finally release a version three that has high throughput and low latency, even on order fills and at that point it should be no different than a regular betting or trading site, except it allows you to access it from anywhere. There's no limits and it's mobile and it's just a great user experience. And so in Q one 2020, we're going to release all of it. V 1.5 with Zero X, V two with Dai, and then shortly after V three is fast trading.
00:02:52.770 - 00:03:16.938, Speaker A: And so here's kind of a preview of ogre V two. So the markets are much more condensed. It's much easier to browse if you log in. There's sign in options where you can log in with the email, Google phone number, metamask as well. So it's a really simple sign in process. If you want to add funds, you can add them in with a debit card, eventually credit cards. It's a much more seamless process.
00:03:16.938 - 00:03:38.146, Speaker A: Actually, using the notes page, you'll be able to use Dai only. So you don't need to own ether at all. In any of this part of this process. You never even really need to know that you're using Ethereum. I think that's really powerful. So here you can see someone's betting on whether trump will win dinner, and then if they want to buy the price, and then we actually show that it's pending. E one.
00:03:38.146 - 00:04:18.606, Speaker A: It just kind of magically appeared like 30 seconds to a minute later here it actually gives you kind of real time updates based on what's happening on chain. Your order is placed and that's kind of a trade in offer. B two, don't really need to know your given needs. And so what's next for offer is really kind of the master plan part too, which is all these uis. We sort of design the mobile first, starting with the mobile experience. That's where about 60% of betting takes place. Then working backwards to a desktop experience, making tools that make it really easy to market make, because having a clarity is super important, focusing on user acquisition growth and also bringing sort of the offline social vetting experience online.
00:04:18.606 - 00:04:46.754, Speaker A: We're going to have some features coming up pretty soon that do that. And there's one more thing we're going to do, which is we're going to release a vetting UI. So this looks pretty similar to something like Betfair. It's a little bit more modern and it allows you to back and lay individual events. The numbers there are how much money you'll win if you bet. So 6.3 extra money, how many dollars you can bet, and then we're going to eventually release an even simpler version of this that's just really easy to lose.
00:04:46.754 - 00:05:10.940, Speaker A: And that's basically what we're working on. I guess one really final thing takes about 10 seconds is in August v, 114 percent of markets that were created were invalid. This is a huge problem that people have historically associated with Auger. After we implemented changes in the end of June to alleviate those problems, of the most recent 143 markets created on Auger, only one of them was invalid. And in v two, we had even more changes to try to lower that even farther. Thanks.
