00:00:13.050 - 00:01:02.160, Speaker A: The title of the workshop is legal Trial Shooting for these projects. And before I say a few words about myself, I'd like to learn a bit more about you and also test out a polling system that will be necessary for this workshop. So, can everyone see the screen? Please visit this website. At this link you'll be able to vote, like, answer the questions that will appear on the screen. In case you don't have Internet connection, you'll find details of one network over there, but it's only 15 connections. So use your own internet if you have and don't try it as well. And let's see if it works.
00:01:02.160 - 00:01:31.580, Speaker A: And by this question, I just mean that you're not necessarily part of DeFi project, but if you are interested in this space, you want to work in this space, you are dealing with some problems related to the DeFi space I don't have.
00:01:35.790 - 00:01:44.650, Speaker B: All right, so it's working righteous.
00:01:47.950 - 00:01:49.500, Speaker A: Does it work for everyone?
00:01:49.950 - 00:01:50.566, Speaker B: Yes.
00:01:50.688 - 00:02:10.040, Speaker A: Okay, that's great. So let's move to another question to you, which is another type of question. Which area of DeFi is of most interest to you? And here you should be able to type a response here we have some examples, right? So that will give me a feeling of what's most interesting for you guys.
00:02:25.450 - 00:02:30.640, Speaker B: Predominantly, it.
00:02:40.210 - 00:02:48.862, Speaker A: Really cool. Seems like it reflects what are the most hot, the hottest topics right now. Really cool.
00:02:48.996 - 00:02:50.400, Speaker C: Risk is so small.
00:02:52.770 - 00:03:11.770, Speaker A: No one appears, right? Everybody said lending, right? And the last question to you guys, where are you based? And here I rather mean where is your DeFi project based?
00:03:11.920 - 00:03:12.282, Speaker D: Right?
00:03:12.336 - 00:04:13.266, Speaker A: Or where is your main interest in terms of DeFi activity? So even if you live in Japan, but you're working on US based project, both in the US. I know that for decentralized projects it might not be so easy, but let's give your best guesses. Okay? Here we can counter. So now a few words about myself. I'm YASC. I'm a blockchain fintech lawyer in crypto for more than five years. And here you have a few affiliations.
00:04:13.266 - 00:04:48.520, Speaker A: Those are most important ones, I think. So I'm a legal counsel at the Maker Foundation, and also I serve on some industry bodies and some DeFi focus groups, such as the Multi Chain Asset Managers Association in Switzerland. I'm a graduate of Oxford. And also I got to Harvard Law School. But my assumption was that I wouldn't go there before the Multi Collateral Dice launched. And it's going to happen next month. So I will be finally to go to Harvard next year.
00:04:48.520 - 00:05:36.162, Speaker A: I'm going to launch a blog focused on the legal aspects of DeFi under this address as soon as I have some time. And also I'm a huge Lego fan. So actually the first thing I did yesterday was to go to the local Lego store to buy some stuff. An important disclaimer before we start, I am a lawyer, just not your lawyer. Nothing here is going to be legal advice, at least for me. Are there any other lawyers in the room? All right, quite a few. So you guys are free to give out your legal advice, but nothing would I say is legal advice and views are my own, right? So I'm not necessarily representing Maker Views right now, or any other organization that I'm somewhat guilty with, Lego included.
00:05:36.162 - 00:06:34.442, Speaker A: So now, troubleshooting of some legal problems. So at first my idea for this workshop was to present you some very specific problems that I think are relevant for DHI projects, which also follows through my practice. But I hope that this workshop format, it would be a better opportunity for this particular format to actually ask you about some thoughts that you have on the topic. So what's going to happen? I'm going to present you a few more general problems that I see, legal problems that I see in the DeFi space. And I'd like you guys to ask you about your opinions about these problems and also about possible solutions. And we can also have some discussion around this. So, any questions the moment? Remember, this is a workshop, so I'd really like to see some discussion here.
00:06:34.442 - 00:07:46.946, Speaker A: Let me present the first one. It's going to be like a test, one that I call Front End liability, which it seems pretty obvious to me, but let me explain in case it isn't to some of you. Even fully decentralized products in the DeFi space, which are some smart contract based protocols that are immutable, unstable and so on, they use some centralized front ends to attract users, right? And decentralized front ends are usually some websites which have some visual domain, centralized hosting. There are some fees collected at this front end level, there is data collection going on just like everything that you'd expect from some usual traditional financial services. When you visited this website and you're getting some services, you are paying for them, your data has been collected and so on. And these front ends and the operators sometimes may run into legal trouble because what they do is they facilitate access to financial services and products. And I have one specific example.
00:07:46.946 - 00:08:20.138, Speaker A: I was trying to provide examples to each of the problems that I'm presenting. You probably know this website, Interdelta, and you probably know that they were hit by some enforcement action in the US. And when you look at the content of their settlement, it's quite striking that the SEC, the American SEC, recognizes the difference between the protocol level and the front end level. Yet in the practice it's really difficult to differently analyze both.
00:08:20.224 - 00:08:20.570, Speaker D: Right?
00:08:20.640 - 00:09:20.480, Speaker A: And it's clear from the language that they're using, they mentioned that a few times that the website Data Delta website had features similar to online future trading platforms, right? And they actually listed these features, right. They are displaying the orders, they're sorted by price and color. There is user account information provided fields to input, deposit, withdrawal and so on, right. They provide all of this information and said this looks like exchange, right? This looks like securities trading venue. There is no difference from the user perspective and of course we all know that there is a certain smart contract going on in the background. Perhaps Ether Delta is not the best example of a totally decentralized product yet you can see that especially if there is just a single frontend to the protocol, which is very often the case in the DeFi space. There is a certain problem that from the regulator's perspective they will not see differently than any other centralized products.
00:09:20.480 - 00:09:27.380, Speaker A: Any questions to these problems, to this problem? Before we get to my questions to you guys?
00:09:28.310 - 00:09:28.882, Speaker D: Go ahead.
00:09:28.936 - 00:09:47.110, Speaker E: So since the front end liability provides just a centralized point of entry, isn't the fact that anyone could make a front end for it remove that liability or is that not affected because there is one sort of official front end.
00:09:47.180 - 00:10:57.646, Speaker A: So one reservation from my side? That's a good question. I'm not talking about any specific regulatory regime, right. I'm trying to abstract away certain problems and all of them I think would be relevant in many jurisdictions around the globe, right? So of course answer to this type of question might be different in some places. I'm just talking about a certain practice, right, that very often these protocols have single front ends, right? And of course this is a very good advice that I'm giving out sometimes that you need to make this difference between protocol layer and front end layer, right? So that you focus your efforts on the protocol layer only. But from the strictly business perspective it's just difficult, right? It's just difficult to encourage people to build something on their protocol and it's just difficult to build a business model on your profile sole, right, so that's why people want to bootstrap this activity, they want to earn money on this. They are building this front end, right, which might get them some regulatory troubles. And actually I have a second example which is not something that question on.
00:10:57.668 - 00:11:03.630, Speaker E: That how do you think about actual traffic? So there might be different front ends.
00:11:04.370 - 00:11:06.706, Speaker A: But would the regulators look at that.
00:11:06.728 - 00:11:08.386, Speaker E: And say 90% of the traffic is.
00:11:08.408 - 00:11:09.810, Speaker F: Going to a specific one?
00:11:09.880 - 00:11:47.262, Speaker A: They want to make the distinction. Again, it's difficult to answer this question without any confidence, right? But I think it's going to be relevant no matter what a precise legal rule or its interpretation, if that's clear that you are providing a certain financial service via this certain front end and you are using this claims about decentralization smart contract based protocol, some other front ends, this is not going to work. If functionally and practically this service is mostly available via this single front end, which does not make it different from any centralized services.
00:11:47.396 - 00:11:48.080, Speaker D: Right?
00:11:48.610 - 00:12:43.650, Speaker A: And the second example is about you've probably heard about the recent Fat AML recommendations. This is a kind of like a global AML regulatory intergovernmental body. They are setting certain standards and recently they came up with a new recommendation that is very relevant for crypto. And so far, the interpretations, like all of this is going to be implemented in all of the countries, right? So this is like an international level, let's say, and so far the interpretations are quite positive, right? So they recognize that, they seem to recognize that if there is a certain service that is decentralized and especially noncustodial, the amount of requirements should not apply, right? But we'll see how this work works out in many countries and I can clearly see that in some places the interpretation might be different.
00:12:43.720 - 00:12:44.002, Speaker D: Right?
00:12:44.056 - 00:13:29.230, Speaker A: So actually something that is providing, even if it's not custodial, but it's providing virtually the same service as some centralized product is going to be subject to AML requirements, which is of course difficult, right? Because there is nothing like I'm aware of AML at the protocol level. You need to apply AML at the front end level and then you end up in a situation in which this protocol is not so relevant anymore because you need a certain front end operator to use these services. So now some questions to you guys that I'm really curious about. This is the first one, front end liability, the problem that I just presented. Have you considered this problem before?
00:13:29.300 - 00:13:29.582, Speaker D: Right?
00:13:29.636 - 00:14:32.238, Speaker A: So I know that majority of you are working on DeFi projects. And now the question is, did you consider this when working on your project? Does it work for everyone, this polling solution? Yeah. Okay, all right, that's interesting. So there is sample acknowledgment of this problem. It would be great to have some discussion, but let's hone it until my last question. The second question is how relevant is this issue for your project, the ones you are working on? Is this something you think that you have considered it? But is it relevant for your particular.
00:14:32.324 - 00:14:32.960, Speaker B: Project.
00:14:58.030 - 00:16:38.680, Speaker A: That people are actually building these front ends on top of their protocols? And there is a second liability, of course, this is not to scare you off, right? These problems that are presenting, these are just issues that I think we should spread knowledge about them also in order to educate regulators and lawmakers about these problems, right? Because sometimes these people are just not aware that there is this split between sometimes like quite obvious to us, but not to them, this split between probable and prong. And now more general question, how relevant is this for the entire DeFi space, in your opinion? All right. And the last key question, if everyone's finished with this one, what's the best solution? So initially I was planning this as like myself, proposing some solutions to you guys, but I'm very curious about your solution. So here we can propose, I think, two solutions and then upvote or downvote solutions provided by some other people.
00:16:39.890 - 00:16:40.640, Speaker B: It.
00:16:46.130 - 00:17:03.440, Speaker A: Anyone remember about uploading and downloading this will give us a feeling of what evolution support.
00:17:04.610 - 00:17:16.230, Speaker B: We freedom.
00:17:48.610 - 00:18:55.510, Speaker A: Should be option that's that's a cool one, but it's it's losing it wonder what all right, so it seems to me it seems like multiple front ends is a winning option, yet looks at like IPFS appears in at least three others, right? So that's certainly a solution that also came to my mind. And people are saying about this for a long time. Does anyone any proponent of this idea know what's the state of actually being able to decentralize both hosting and domains is anyone aware of because everyone knows that it's possible, right? But I haven't seen anything like that in practice.
00:18:56.330 - 00:19:25.630, Speaker G: I would say the state is that the problem is the DNS end, right? You can use ENS or something and I think now, like MetaMask will handle getting you to that domain. I may be wrong, but the problem is that's not widely supported. So in the end, if you want anybody to just be able to access your website, you need something, somewhere for basically anyone except the most already technological.
00:19:25.970 - 00:19:49.234, Speaker A: Be able to do it. Because definitely this technological solution is a problem, right? So just like front ends are a problem because they are centralized. So let's decentralize front ends would be probably a very good solution, right? But the fact that it does not exist in practice at least, my conclusion is that it's not ready. It does not exist.
00:19:49.282 - 00:19:49.638, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:49.724 - 00:20:05.086, Speaker A: It's a cool solution that it's not available right now. Multiple front ends, that's a really cool idea. That is at least two options as well. It's just like does anyone want to share experience on that one?
00:20:05.268 - 00:20:24.400, Speaker E: I just have a question regarding that one and it maybe goes back to Ether Delta. And because I don't exactly see how this will front end solves the problem with the Ether Delta case, if I had been the one to implement that front end on their protocol, would I have been the one receiving the.
00:20:36.730 - 00:20:37.046, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:37.068 - 00:21:00.046, Speaker A: I think that of course, it wouldn't be like a super suit. I mean, by doing this, you are just underlining the fact that the front end layer is separate from the protocol layer, right? So the part of the legal strategy here that I'm seeing from time to time is to say, okay, there might be some regulated activities going on in there, but they are not happening on.
00:21:00.068 - 00:21:00.842, Speaker B: The front end layer.
00:21:00.906 - 00:21:33.820, Speaker A: We are just like providing this information. They're happening on the protocol layer. Try regulated protocols, not the front end operators. This is at the core of this strategy. Does anyone want to have any experience with this? Like building a decentralized product and trying to actually bootstrap multi front end support? Because for some reason it's not happening very often as well, right? I already said at the beginning that my feeling is that it's just difficult from the business perspective, right, to encourage people to do this. But if there's something else good.
00:21:34.270 - 00:21:41.994, Speaker E: My experience was talking about earlier, they focus on what the spirit of the law and so if you're enabling people, that's their issue.
00:21:42.032 - 00:21:43.734, Speaker A: So I can't agree with these activities.
00:21:43.862 - 00:21:53.120, Speaker E: Just enabling an activity which they seem to be illegal and so they're going to go after whoever is enabling that multiple front ends from my perspective, doesn't solve anything.
00:21:55.330 - 00:22:21.500, Speaker F: Just to add to that, I think that, yes, my experience with regulators are similar, but I think that there are multiple front ends thing. It's not really you can't go to a regulator and say, listen, look, there's another front end, let me off. That's the kind of argument you make to a judge in an extremely legal argument saying because of this, and it's a little more complicated than that, but because of this technicality, let me off, you won't get the regulator off your back, it won't come to you.
00:22:21.870 - 00:22:34.734, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. I think that we need to think about this together with test solution, full decoupled protocol and front end, right. This is the first step that needs to be done in order to disconnect making any sense.
00:22:34.932 - 00:22:41.902, Speaker E: And it's like in terms of bootstrapping those multiple, how do you incentivize someone to create a front end?
00:22:41.956 - 00:22:42.222, Speaker D: Right?
00:22:42.276 - 00:23:20.182, Speaker E: Because it feels like it's not clear that just creating a front end on top of this protocol, I'm not actually just shouldering a bunch of that regulatory risk. So my incentive is going to have to be pretty strong to weigh into those waters. Also, if you don't have some sort of really consistent and sustainable business model, then these projects become harder and harder to be able to properly sustain and expand themselves. Especially with all the legal risks associated with most DeFi projects. That gets very expensive very quickly.
00:23:20.336 - 00:23:44.142, Speaker A: Yeah. Yesterday, if you attended the grooms maker CEO speech, you could see his hint at part of our strategy. I mean, like approach or ideal approach, which is regulate on edges, right? And in the same way as bitcoin or ethereum. No one is trying to regulate what's happening in these networks, yet there is certain regulation on edges such as exchanges.
00:23:44.206 - 00:23:44.626, Speaker D: Right.
00:23:44.728 - 00:24:21.342, Speaker A: This is like a certain strategy that many people are trying to convince regulators to so that they leave this decentralized part alone and try to regulate around. But of course, for them it's difficult to accept something like this, right. To allow that certain regulator activity is just being transferred to some protocol layer. And that's why I think that it's not here on the list. But I could see it on the phone that there was another option changing the law.
00:24:21.396 - 00:24:21.806, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:21.908 - 00:24:58.410, Speaker A: No one knows how exactly, but that's a certain option as well, right. Perhaps this law doesn't work anymore in this context. Right. This is like for us, it's obvious. How can you regulate this thing, right? You can regulate this content, you can put these guys to jail. But this protocol still exists, right? This is like the blockchain itself, if the smart contract is built in this way, right? Any other comments on some other solutions here? Right, we have this one. Try template and change your blending.
00:24:58.410 - 00:26:33.462, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting one in practice, is there anyone from Gnosis here? Because in practice this is being followed by Dev, right? They established this dxDAO which is governing Tatchex decks, right? They're trying to out in practice so that these Dow is actually controlling the decks. I mean, interesting, but outside of this example, I haven't seen this in practice, right? The question is the question is if you really can have centralized hosting owned by Dao, right? This is still open, right? There is a certain risk that at least some jurisdiction, this Dao would be just classified as a certain partnership or association or something which would not protect its members or whoever from liability, right? But let's move to other problems because there are six of them, as we are just number one. So the second one I called decentralization. And the problem is again simple, I think, which is that decentralized financial products are often partially centralized. And this, I think is quite obvious to many people in this space. They're just examples of decentralized centralization spots. There is also sometimes lack of transparency, right, so that people are actually not aware or they don't know what centralized and what's decentralized.
00:26:33.526 - 00:26:33.706, Speaker D: Right.
00:26:33.728 - 00:28:09.078, Speaker A: There is like certain marketing about decentralized financial services. Yet when people look closer, sometimes it's just clear that just some parts are decentralized or there are some centralized elements. And I think Texas is the best example of that, right? So that people for business reasons are incorporating some centralization in their services so that it's more faster, it's better for reusers because it provides the better service. And why is that important? This undermines the core legal claim of many DeFi projects, right? Because many projects talking about totally high level legal strategy, they're saying this is complete decentralized, right? I'm not controlling it, so why would I be responsible for this if I'm not running this? Yet it seems that sometimes there are some operators or people with keys that can do something. And again, example compound was last month, compound was like there was such a spotlight on this project due to some centralized features, which is not necessarily accusation or anything against Compound because at least to my knowledge, they're writing this quite openly in their white paper, that it has decentralized functionalities with this ultimate goal towards full decentralization.
00:28:09.174 - 00:28:09.530, Speaker D: Right?
00:28:09.600 - 00:28:35.490, Speaker A: But that's the reality of many DeFi projects, right? That due to many reasons also lack of sufficient development of technology, they are implementing decentralized features. But still this may undermine this legal strategy. So now questions, and this will be the same one, did you consider this problem in the legal.
00:28:39.670 - 00:28:42.050, Speaker E: How does it affect you on the legal?
00:28:43.990 - 00:28:53.906, Speaker A: I just explained decentralization by itself is very often like a legal right. Don't regulate this product. This is central, this is decentralized.
00:28:53.938 - 00:28:54.134, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:54.172 - 00:28:59.798, Speaker A: So there is no one to regulate. Yet in many cases you actually see that there is someone behind.
00:28:59.884 - 00:29:00.518, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:00.684 - 00:29:10.602, Speaker A: For example, even if this is noncustodial, there is someone who is controlling price feeds which effectively gives a lot of control over the product.
00:29:10.736 - 00:29:11.418, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:11.584 - 00:29:15.454, Speaker E: So they can come for you for using control.
00:29:15.572 - 00:29:18.782, Speaker A: It just undermines this very claim that there is no one behind it.
00:29:18.836 - 00:29:19.006, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:19.028 - 00:29:22.890, Speaker A: So that it's running on the town. It's like complete decentralized like bitcoin.
00:29:22.970 - 00:29:23.600, Speaker B: Right?
00:29:28.050 - 00:29:28.846, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:29.028 - 00:30:08.270, Speaker A: So quite a big awareness of this stuff. The let's move to the next question which is become relevant in this issue for your project. Does anyone want to openly say which project they are representing and why they're choosing one of these options?
00:30:08.340 - 00:30:08.878, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:30:08.964 - 00:31:11.246, Speaker E: Yeah, so I'm with Sopho finance we do optimize interest rates across and so I think from our perspective, one we're like we're literally launching today so we're super new and obviously we've seen generally it's really hard to launch straight fully decentralized. Right. I think one of the ways that we're thinking about it is trying to make sure we're decentralized in the direct areas in which case in which we're maybe running a little bit into a gray area in terms of regulation. Right, so I'd be interested to hear kind of your perspective on that of custodianship for example. I mean that's totally unrelated to topo custodianship is element of centralization but it's also like you can be compliant with regulation in that capacity but then like these other elements where you're maybe a little less compliant with standard regulation, those are the areas that you focus on your defense.
00:31:11.358 - 00:31:28.882, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good point and that's absolutely true. Again, I'm trying to present extremely general problems so that people might think about that no matter from what country they're coming and what they're actually doing. But of course this highly depends on context.
00:31:28.946 - 00:31:29.174, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:29.212 - 00:33:22.830, Speaker A: So your certain decentralization centralization balance, the result might be that you are subject to AML requirements in certain jurisdictions but not to securities trading requirements, right? That really depends. Of course you need to very carefully look into specifics and also specific regulation like in the given country in order to come up with precise answers. Out of necessity we need to stay on this high level label. Okay, next question. How relevant is this issue for entire DeFi space? And the last one solutions, any ideas of how to I know that it's extremely general but at the same time I see this problem being repeated in many contexts. Any solutions to this one? Does anyone want to say what they understand by gradual decentralization?
00:33:29.090 - 00:34:04.186, Speaker E: I didn't put it but what I assume I mean is that you sort of either do smart contract upgradability or some proxy content you can do. You start out at a point where you are fairly centralized, so you have maybe seven Oracles or maybe some databases, maybe IP hashes, and then as you and then through multiple stages, multiple sprints, you sort of design the architecture of the application. Smart contract. You need more and more decentralized, so less reliance on centralized points of data, black boxes or other Oracles. If somebody wants to contradict me, I.
00:34:04.208 - 00:34:16.830, Speaker F: Just want to add one more thing to that. It's also important to be careful about token allocations and governance and make sure that over time allocations become more distributed.
00:34:17.650 - 00:34:40.680, Speaker A: Certainly if a token is a part of a certain problem, certainly that's the case. And I think transparency is a really good point. It's getting a lot of votes as well, right? This is not like a solution per se, but at least it really delivers a lot of value towards your users and potentially interested regulators as well, so that you're transparent in what you're doing.
00:34:44.810 - 00:34:45.222, Speaker D: Right?
00:34:45.276 - 00:36:14.014, Speaker A: Awareness is possibly about the same thing, right? Let's move on. So the third problem is about integrative incumbent finance, which is not only a legal problem, I think, but also so one example is that these are like from the legal institutional perspective, these are two completely different boards, right? And one specific example of that is that in DeFi or blockchain in general, we are mostly talking about bearer assets, right? Like Bitcoin. So that you own the keys, you own the assets, right? And that's all. There is no custody, there's no other party here. In traditional finance, this is about almost all about registered assets. So that your asset is actually a claim against someone that sometimes it's really complicated who this other person is that is somehow obligated towards you, right? If you are holding like a stock, like most of the countries in the world, you're having this claim against company. But actually there is a certain custodian, there is a certain broker that is actually holding this legal, right? And this is just an example, right? We all know that DeFi is mostly about building things that are permissionless in traditional finance.
00:36:14.014 - 00:37:05.214, Speaker A: By their definition, these are permissions options that are based on some trusted parties and essential counterparties. And now example at Maker, we actually had this discussion in the community recently about MCD and non trustless or permission as I call it, assets in SCD, right? How would that play out? And how exactly can we combine this permissioned nature of many assets with the permissionless nature of the whole product of MCD and the Maker system? And that sounds extremely general, but there are very practical questions about it, right? Like how do you answer this question? What will happen if certain asset that is held as collateral is frozen?
00:37:05.262 - 00:37:05.522, Speaker D: Right.
00:37:05.576 - 00:37:08.470, Speaker A: Or their force transfer function is used?
00:37:08.540 - 00:37:09.254, Speaker D: Right?
00:37:09.452 - 00:38:18.150, Speaker A: These are also technical problems, not to mention that they're legal ones, right? Because what does it mean to stop something and who's holding this asset once it is in a permissionless network? So that's a very specific problem because that's not necessarily a problem, regulatory problem, right. As the other ones that we are talking about, that there is a certain risk that us as defined projects creators might be held to liability. This is a strictly legal problem that we have because we somehow want these real world assets to be brought into the DeFi space. Yet we are facing these problems. And this is also not just about assets but also integrating with the traditional financial infrastructure, right? So, for example, bringing DeFi assets into traditional finance, this is the same problem, right? How to bring permissionless assets into a permissionless environment. There we go with questions. Did you consider this problem? It might not be totally relevant for some projects, for some other it is extremely relevant.
00:38:20.370 - 00:38:30.014, Speaker B: It's perfectly so.
00:38:30.052 - 00:38:35.860, Speaker A: Let's see if you guys think it's relevant for you.
00:38:49.370 - 00:38:50.230, Speaker D: All right?
00:38:50.380 - 00:39:03.590, Speaker B: Anyone wants to comment on that's?
00:39:05.550 - 00:39:59.240, Speaker A: Also a legal problem in a way that this is how regulation is built, right? Like financial laws are response to how financial system works and it works in a permissioned manner, right? This is perhaps the source of the problem. And how relevant is for the entire DeFi space? Of course, it depends on the perspective, right? Because if people are thinking about DeFi, it's like completely something completely alternative towards the traditional financial system. Perhaps it's not relevant at all. But those that think about integration and converging those areas, it is probably super relevant. Let me speed up a bit.
00:40:00.370 - 00:40:01.120, Speaker B: It.
00:40:50.370 - 00:42:28.714, Speaker A: It seems that friendly jurisdictions are getting a lot of votes both up and down, vote regulate on the edges, which is a winning option. Here is a nice one. Yet it's not a solution in a way that it's not something that we can apply, right? Because we are not regulating. But of course, one thing that is becoming more and more obvious to me is that we as the DeFi movement need to engage in these regulatory discussions. Right now it seems that certain momentum is building, especially in the stablecoin space with Libre approaching. And we need to build this awareness, right? How DeFi projects are different from all the other that might also function like crypto space, yet they're here. I think that majority of us is saying that change the law, regulate on the ages, which is like convince regulators or lock America to regulate on the edges and sandbox facilities or to convince them to build sandboxes is the winning option.
00:42:28.714 - 00:43:32.000, Speaker A: And that's something I agree with in a way that I think that's what we need to do, right? Just to try to evaluate how the law is functioning currently, right? Next problem, which is very simple. DeFi is global. This is again by very definition something that people can use whenever they want, wherever they want. Yes, regulation is. Local, right? Like you are facing sometimes completely different problems in many jurisdictions, sometimes not completely different. Yet these details are of utmost importance and I have now it's not an example, it's a country example because that's what we are pursuing as well. We are facing this problem as well, right? That Dai might be and right now I'm wearing Mate representative Dai might be treated in many countries differently, right.
00:43:32.000 - 00:44:07.190, Speaker A: Money is a financial instrument as something else, right, depending on the local laws. Yet we are trying to do our best sometimes in regulatory dialogue as well to protect this free status of digital cash, right, of like a spot instrument that is not regulated. It's just not a regulated instrument. So far we are doing good job here, but the problem remains, right, that these products, services might be regulated differently and it's difficult for us to respond to that, right? Because we are building something that is global.
00:44:09.370 - 00:44:24.926, Speaker B: Did you consider there is problematic and.
00:44:24.948 - 00:44:42.440, Speaker A: By the way, this data, I'm I'm going to share it, of course, I hope that is giving the option to save all of this. Of course, all of this is completely anonymous, right? But it's going to be very useful, I think, and interesting to see this disaggregated data and present it to the wider community.
00:44:45.050 - 00:44:47.766, Speaker C: So global compliance sounds like, yes, it.
00:44:47.788 - 00:44:50.106, Speaker A: Might be a problem, but it also sounds like it could be a way.
00:44:50.128 - 00:44:58.954, Speaker C: To frame the solution, right? Like there could be global standards around globally. Wild financial things.
00:44:59.072 - 00:44:59.740, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:01.390 - 00:45:08.320, Speaker C: Do you know the current state of any global standards around maybe the most prevalent things?
00:45:08.850 - 00:45:44.934, Speaker E: We're like a million miles from that. Yeah, just because even just between the United States and China and then the European Union and then Southeast, there's just so many widely different ways to run their economies and there is just an entire structure where we mean YouTube, for example, and Netflix all have to completely map around the way they contribute form organized media. Even something like Blockchain, something like DeFi would be an absolute best try to get them into the same table, let alone agree on that set of financial assets and credibility.
00:45:45.062 - 00:46:18.086, Speaker A: That's true. But actually I devoted my talk at the DeFi summit in London last month exactly to the topic, like 30 minutes exactly to that. So encourage everyone to have a look if you're interested. This is also interesting because sometimes it's just people are just saying, hey, we are not available or operating in any specific country. We are available globally. But that means that no specific laws apply to us, right? Because we are not present specifically in any country. So that forms some strategy for some people as well.
00:46:18.086 - 00:46:20.840, Speaker A: Right. How relevant is that for your first?
00:46:33.150 - 00:46:43.840, Speaker C: So related to the question of global compliance standards, who would be the kind of multinational regulatory body to watch?
00:46:45.410 - 00:46:59.026, Speaker A: There's nothing like that. But there is something what is called standard setting bodies which are not necessarily regulators in terms they're not able to adopt binding rules, but they are developing their standards and encouraging others to adopt them.
00:46:59.048 - 00:46:59.282, Speaker D: Right.
00:46:59.336 - 00:47:00.610, Speaker C: Is that like IMF.
00:47:02.950 - 00:47:04.130, Speaker F: Standards or something?
00:47:04.280 - 00:47:12.502, Speaker A: Fat is an example. Fat in AML space, there's IOSCO in security space and a few others.
00:47:12.556 - 00:47:12.774, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:12.812 - 00:47:19.606, Speaker A: And they are like think tanks that are producing yeah, I mean, actual regulators and countries are participating in these bodies.
00:47:19.638 - 00:47:19.786, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:19.808 - 00:47:54.530, Speaker A: So they're not like just think tanks. And as an example of Faf shows, they are extremely relevant. How relevant is it for the entirety of space? And as I said, this is the current stage at least it's not necessarily like a bad thing.
00:47:54.600 - 00:47:54.882, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:54.936 - 00:48:04.230, Speaker A: Although always so if it's like a certain legal issue, that's not necessarily a problem. Right. So what's the best solution?
00:48:19.890 - 00:48:20.640, Speaker B: It.
00:49:13.170 - 00:49:14.910, Speaker A: It'S not necessarily a problem.
00:49:15.060 - 00:49:15.760, Speaker D: Right.
00:49:20.130 - 00:50:02.700, Speaker A: And global standards? Yes, definitely an interesting one. Yet they might be at least in some like AML, for example, that's something that might be some close to global coordination that's happening already. Some other things, like secret regulation, this is going to be probably impossible to get coordination. One interesting example is the approach to stablecoins with Libera approaching and all of these mass people from central bankers, from various countries saying that they're not going to allow this. This will be a very interesting test for international coordination. Are all the major economists actually able to coordinate on this matter?
00:50:03.490 - 00:50:05.520, Speaker F: I'm the one who said it's not a problem.
00:50:05.970 - 00:50:07.614, Speaker E: I find it interesting that the top.
00:50:07.652 - 00:50:34.418, Speaker F: Two options are literally opposite of each other. But I think people underestimate how difficult it is. If you have global standards that you don't like, you basically start having to go I won't say underground, but you start having to play in the spaces between the regulations people. Is it implemented a bit differently here? Is it done a bit differently here? That sort of thing is great for lawyers, but not for people who want to build projects.
00:50:34.594 - 00:50:43.990, Speaker A: And these standards exist. Like these laws are more or less similar in many countries because the policy concerns are the same or almost identical.
00:50:44.070 - 00:50:44.506, Speaker D: Right.
00:50:44.608 - 00:50:50.646, Speaker A: So there are certain standards. The question is if these are not details which are problematic here.
00:50:50.688 - 00:50:51.374, Speaker B: Right.
00:50:51.572 - 00:50:56.106, Speaker E: When you come from a country that has bad regulations, pretty much you don't.
00:50:56.138 - 00:50:58.334, Speaker A: Care about like for example for example.
00:50:58.452 - 00:51:12.222, Speaker E: On Honduras, you have a lot of problems. Corruption pretty much just don't care. So it's better just to disrupt. So that's a thing that it works disruptive.
00:51:12.366 - 00:51:32.630, Speaker C: Is there a difference between global standards of regulation and global standards of definition about various things? Like maybe like for example, definition of die is diet security is not. I don't know how the world works with definitions versus regulation.
00:51:32.710 - 00:51:34.602, Speaker A: No, that's more or less the same.
00:51:34.656 - 00:51:35.260, Speaker D: As.
00:51:38.430 - 00:51:59.314, Speaker A: For the purpose of AML work at Fat, it was extremely relevant how virtual currency is defined. Right. That was one of the core problems. Right. Let's run this really quickly. Developer liability, I'm not sure if that requires any explanation here. Just one example, because there was a lot of theoretical thoughts about this.
00:51:59.314 - 00:52:27.046, Speaker A: But one example avoid laws are being implemented by many countries in Europe right now and this is something that the UK government proposed. They asked the question, would it make sense to apply this regulation to people that are dealing with the publication of open source software, which includes, but is not limited to non custodian wallet software and other types of crypto related software?
00:52:27.078 - 00:52:27.274, Speaker D: Right.
00:52:27.312 - 00:52:35.146, Speaker A: So this would be not just banks or crypto exchanges that would be subject to this type of regulation, but also open source.
00:52:35.178 - 00:52:35.760, Speaker B: That.
00:52:37.810 - 00:53:17.574, Speaker A: Did you consider this problem? All right, that's actually quite surprising. I thought it would be close to 100%. Yes. But let's move on. How relevant is this issue for your project? I mean, it's of course difficult to say, right, if you're not a lawyer, but just your feeling about it, people are afraid to answer. Not relevant.
00:53:17.622 - 00:53:18.220, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:22.910 - 00:53:56.454, Speaker A: It's how relevant it is for the entire defect space. You it the reasoning again is that if you have decentralized financial services and regulators are looking for something that is called access points, you may want to address users, miners, but developers like people that are actually doing this shit and not only developing protocols but also front ends seem like an office.
00:53:56.652 - 00:54:04.666, Speaker F: But from the regulatory cost point of view, do you think regulators will run after these developers? Because that includes a huge amount of cost for this.
00:54:04.848 - 00:54:27.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, again, this is like a general problem that might materialize in some specific context, right? Of course, I do not foresee this world in which developers would need to go underground because there would be like huge regulatory enforcement action at all of you guys. Right, but in some context that might be relevant, like a shot with the same values.
00:54:27.982 - 00:54:28.386, Speaker D: Right.
00:54:28.488 - 00:54:33.714, Speaker A: It's enough if there is like this small detail that would really make a difference.
00:54:33.912 - 00:54:36.470, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:54:36.620 - 00:55:00.538, Speaker A: Solutions. Actually, I think that here the best solution would be to but I wait.
00:55:00.624 - 00:55:01.260, Speaker B: Until.
00:55:08.110 - 00:55:10.570, Speaker A: Anonymous test, dark desk.
00:55:12.190 - 00:55:12.940, Speaker B: It.
00:55:18.070 - 00:55:23.010, Speaker A: You know, it's it's not that sometimes we may think that it's like without any sense at all.
00:55:23.080 - 00:55:23.362, Speaker D: Right.
00:55:23.416 - 00:55:34.662, Speaker A: But you know, imagine like a dev that is just developing a Ponzi scheme with full knowledge that it's going to serve this purpose, with deploying the code and promoting the code.
00:55:34.716 - 00:55:35.320, Speaker D: Right.
00:55:36.090 - 00:55:45.900, Speaker A: That's non obvious, right. Whether we might want to go after this. There is a certain rationale for doing right. We're fine.
00:55:48.270 - 00:55:53.662, Speaker F: But what is the definition of a developer over here if it's an open source and everybody can contribute the community.
00:55:53.716 - 00:56:26.706, Speaker A: Of that's true, right? Yes, that's true. Right. Okay, so we are really running out of time. So let's quickly go through the last piece, which is just like pure legal partners, right? So some cases in which you might want to do something that do this legally, you just can't. And two examples. The first one is just is just impossible to beat the regulated tax right now due to some legal requirements. This is like the precise provision.
00:56:26.706 - 00:57:14.630, Speaker A: We don't have time to elaborate on this. And this I'm not going to say because I avoid it at all costs that you just mentioned. But this is another problem, right? It actually stops a lot of blockchain projects because people don't know how to deal with. So, last series of questions, legal barriers, laws that are just not responding well to this new product. Which does not mean that sometimes the fact that they are not covering something explicitly is not a problem, it's rather opportunity, but sometimes they are stopping people from doing things legally.
00:57:16.570 - 00:57:17.238, Speaker D: All right.
00:57:17.324 - 00:57:53.780, Speaker A: Not sure how many answers does have, but seems like how relevant is this for your project? Sometimes people overestimate this because they have a certain feelings about the law in general. But this is a real problem very often. How is this relevant for the whole DeFi space?
00:58:07.390 - 00:58:46.770, Speaker B: It FM.
00:58:50.410 - 00:59:38.374, Speaker A: This one actually has like a very simple solution, right? Just change the law, just make these people that are responsible for this aware of these problems, which is possibly the best result. Sometimes the question is if we want to do that, right? Especially those people that have this mindset of building something that's completely alternative. They just don't want to make people aware as regulators, right? Because they think that it's going to bring some problems and it's a valid problem. So there is a wind option. All right, so we are radically late. I think that time up. This is the card.
00:59:38.374 - 01:00:05.998, Speaker A: So thank you very much. I'm going to use this data hopefully on DeFi Law blog and present these ideas. And I really hope that this will be just like the initial discussion about general problems and we'll get into specifics as a community, right? Because we really need to share these problems, common problems, as we can see as projects and think about solutions that would apply to everyone.
01:00:06.084 - 01:00:13.838, Speaker E: Can you just mention the last two ones? Just to begin research on all? There were eight, right? Eight problems.
01:00:14.004 - 01:00:22.080, Speaker A: No, six. Sorry, that's my mistake. These were six problems. So that's actually the very end. Thanks.
01:00:24.610 - 01:00:39.010, Speaker B: You, Sam.
