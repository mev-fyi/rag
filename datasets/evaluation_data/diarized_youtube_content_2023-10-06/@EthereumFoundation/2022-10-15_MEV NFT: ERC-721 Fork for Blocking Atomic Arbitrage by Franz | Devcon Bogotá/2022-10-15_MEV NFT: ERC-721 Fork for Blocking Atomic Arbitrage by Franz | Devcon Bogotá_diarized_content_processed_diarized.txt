00:00:00.250 - 00:00:44.154, Speaker A: Um, yeah. What started this talk? It started in April. There was a tweet by Bert Miller from Flashbots about a moonbird that was actually bought for 44 E and then immediately leased, sold in one single transaction for 240 E. And when I saw this, I was like, wow, this is pretty insane. And I really dived into the topic. So at first I'm going to give a short introduction. What is mev? Basically, who can say? Here what happens.
00:00:44.154 - 00:01:34.146, Speaker A: If you click, like, swap on uniswap in a one sentence, maybe the transaction gets submitted to the mempool. And the technical view is you have the public map pool where you can submit the transaction. And in traditional finance, you only have like, a centralized server and then the transactions get executed. With the public mapool, though, people can see your transaction and they can insert their own transaction before or even I mean, the miner itself can insert the transactions, manipulate them, block them. And yeah, there's a more technical explanation about what's different in POS in the last slide, but due time. Yeah. So basically mev exists also in all the auctions.
00:01:34.146 - 00:02:14.310, Speaker A: It's basically if you skip the auction, make a contract with the seller itself. In this case, the seller is the block space. And yeah. What is an NFT? For me, it was kind of interesting to understand that NFT is kind of like the same as an ERC 20 token, but with an ID that was much more understandable to me than like non fungible token. And if you look at Google search volume, you will see that one to 10,000 people google how to create a ERC 20 token each month. And people want to create an NFT. It's like 10,000 to 10,0000 people.
00:02:14.310 - 00:02:46.682, Speaker A: So you could assume that NFTs are very mainstream. And also the gas, if you look at Ethereum, is kind of high from NFT projects. So Openc is always in the top ten of gas vendors. You can see the beautiful NFT project on the side. Another question. What happens if you make a collection bid on an NFT site? It doesn't work on every marketplace, but maybe someone knows. No.
00:02:46.682 - 00:03:48.946, Speaker A: So basically, if you click and make a collection bid on an NFT marketplace, usually the auction is off chain, but once the contract gets settled in the mempool, people can still do arbitrage. So let's dive into this rabbit hole. So what is NFT arbitrage? Basically, you buy the NFT at one marketplace and you sell it at the other marketplace. What is special about it is in crypto, you can do it in a single transaction in one block. There's some particular cases about NFTs and mev or in general value extraction. So the moonbird example is pretty extreme, I find. And also the apecoin, maybe you've heard of it, they had a token for every NFT holder, and there was a trader who basically lend the NFTs, claimed the tokens and then sold them immediately.
00:03:48.946 - 00:04:40.866, Speaker A: So he netted more than like, $600,000, I think. So what can we do about it? Because if you look at the Lifecycle of NFT, it's like, pretty mainstream. And I don't assume Bill Murray knows what happens in the mempool. There's a couple of resources to educate yourself. There's this website, Mev Tools, which shows also how to mint an NFT or submitted transactions through Flashbots, which is basically skipping the mempool. There's other ways you can avoid it, right? So if you have an auction where you have a commit reveal, you first commit, and then once you place a bid, you reveal your bid, and you cannot front run it because you need the commit first. So when you buy an ENS domain, you have to wait 1 minute.
00:04:40.866 - 00:05:18.990, Speaker A: That's basically the reason why. So the lifecycle of NFT, you have the minting process here. It can lead to gas wars. So, I don't know. There was a soccer project that actually had $1 million in gas fees, and the NFT mint was less valuable than it's crazy, right? And if you submit a transaction to Flashpots, basically, if it fails, you don't need to pay gas. So that's important. But also, there's been cases where an NFT project might be super successful and people were bribing the miners to make sure that they minted.
00:05:18.990 - 00:06:07.220, Speaker A: So even if you're like a normal consumer, you don't have any chance to mint it. Right. And the holding time of an NFT, I mean, it indicates basically, if the NFTs are flipped. And yeah, the transfer function is basically for auctions. What can we do? And one idea is we just fork the ERC 71 contract, and if you think about, okay, what is atomic arbitrage? You sell it and buy it in one block. So we just simply lock the last transfer and we block the ID from being transferred twice per block. It's a very simple solution, but obviously some contracts might not work with it.
00:06:07.220 - 00:06:42.906, Speaker A: So what else can we do? What are conclusions? First of all, there's different stakeholders. So the markets, they just want to sell. The artists just want to sell. The users, I mean, they don't spend so much money. NFT is a bit like long tail. There's been a case where somebody just wrote a function for I think it was a potato or something, and the volume is pretty variable, so it might not be the best trading for a high volume trading company. And, yeah, there's different resources.
00:06:42.906 - 00:07:04.998, Speaker A: We've been working on an extension which shows mev activity, phishing activity, and, yeah, time is over. Here's the sources. Thank you so much. Thanks to Alan, Bertmiller and so many more. Maybe I forgot some. And you can find me on Twitter under filmfronts. Thank you.
00:07:04.998 - 00:07:06.530, Speaker A: Smash. Bye.
