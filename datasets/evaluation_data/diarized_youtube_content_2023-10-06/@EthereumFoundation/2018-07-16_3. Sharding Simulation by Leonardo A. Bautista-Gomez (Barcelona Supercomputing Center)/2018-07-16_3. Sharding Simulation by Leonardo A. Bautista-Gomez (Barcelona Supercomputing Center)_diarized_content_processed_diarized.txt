00:00:09.740 - 00:00:55.470, Speaker A: So good morning, my name is Renaldo Bautista. First of all I want to thank you foundation for inviting me to this event. So this is my first talk in the blockchain community or the token community. So allow me to first introduce myself. So I'm originally from Nicaragua, which is that and then I moved to Paris where I did my distributed computing. I did my bachelor and a master in the Politics university. Then I moved to Tokyo, where I did my PhD on photographs for hyperformance computing at the Doctor Institute of Technology.
00:00:55.470 - 00:02:05.632, Speaker A: At the end of my PhD I got to offer a position as a postdoc researcher in arguing lab near to Chicago where the frequently two years ago I also offered senior researcher position at the Bacterial Computing Center which is where I am working right now to give you an introduction of the bacteria computing center. It's that over 500 employees, 80% of those researchers. We do research in computer science, hyperformed computing applications, air science, biology, climate and so on. So this is also the cost of one of the biggest supercomputers in Europe. It's Marinostom Four which is located in Barcelona and it has a performance of about eleven petaflops. It's actually top 22nd super, fastest supercomputer in the world. I think it's in the top five of the fastest supercomputers in Europe.
00:02:05.632 - 00:02:58.020, Speaker A: This is a picture of it. It's located just next to our offices. It has 3456 nodes. Each one of those nodes has two processors, single platinum, each one with twelve cores. So that allows you to make executions on over 150,000 processes at the same time. In this supercomputer we do simulations about climate, weather simulations, computational flow dynamics, molecular dynamics, artificial intelligence and so on. And so my idea for this project was to try to simulate a sharpie blockchain in a super and basically tune all the parameters that we are still discussing about how is the best way to implement Sharding.
00:02:58.020 - 00:03:48.624, Speaker A: What this allows you to do is also to play with different aspects that are not that easy to play in a testnet. For example, you could try to play with the reliability of the nodes and increase or decrease the vulnerability. You could try to accelerate time a little bit because you are doing a simulation. You can try to play with different number of notaries different number of charts, what is the best look ahead period in order for the clients to update in time and so on and so on and so on. The idea of this project is to simulate blockchain in the supercomputer. So I was doing a first implementation on my own with message passive internet interface. We call it MPI.
00:03:48.624 - 00:04:39.060, Speaker A: It's a library to communicate between different processes in a supercomputer. But at the same time italic released a proof of concept about charging. So I took this code and I tried to study understand it, I documented it and I refactor it because this code is running sequential in one single node. And the idea would be to have this running on a distributed scenario, many, many cores at the same time. So this is what I'm doing. The good thing is that this already implements some of the things that we have been putting, like a different chain and so on and so on. Okay, so the idea is to run this well, to parallelize this, to implement all the features that are not there.
00:04:39.060 - 00:05:09.680, Speaker A: There are quite a number of features that are not and try to make experiments in a sort of computer. This gives you different types of results. This is just a nice figure that shows you how different charts behave. The blue one, the blue line is the main chain. The green one is the beacon chain. The yellow ones are the charts. The charts and the red line, that is basically the connection between the collations in different charts and the blocks in the different chain.
00:05:09.680 - 00:05:48.296, Speaker A: But of course, this doesn't give you much information about how the network is behaving whether this parameter is just good or not. And so this is what I'm implementing right now on this code. So this is basically the status of the project. The project is due to start as of now. We have a first version of the code that is online in this link. And if you are interested on contributing or helping or have questions, don't hesitate to contact me. You have my email address and everything.
00:05:48.296 - 00:05:49.190, Speaker A: So thank you.
