00:00:13.530 - 00:00:15.294, Speaker A: We did not expect this interest.
00:00:15.492 - 00:00:25.150, Speaker B: We are simply facilitators and will not be speaking very much all about you guys and collaborating. We are trying to solve a coordination problem by having this workshop.
00:00:27.530 - 00:01:10.986, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Should we get started? Okay, so as Eva said, we're just going to talk for a brief second to give you an intro to why we put on this workshop, why we're giving you guys the space to talk a little bit on our thoughts and then how the session is going to go. So if you don't know where you are, this is workshop on dows titled beyond Dows Evolving human Organization. So we're going to be talking all things dows and everything wonderful and horrible about them. So as I said, we're just going to run really quickly, maybe ten to 15 minutes. The format of the session is a workshop, so we're going to have you guys working with each other. It's something that you can come in and out of, but it would be great for you guys to say the whole session.
00:01:10.986 - 00:01:51.226, Speaker A: It's an hour and a half, so it's not too long. We promise that it will probably be okay. So let's just start off with why we're holding this session. So even I think that dows can be more than multi things. And that's probably, I mean, I hope not a hot take, but dows are representing this really cool thing that we're all talking about. I mean, that's why we're all in the room here today, because this is something that is really interesting, but also really big. So what inspired this workshop? So I guess I wanted to go through why we think dows can be more than multi sigs.
00:01:51.226 - 00:01:56.274, Speaker A: And from our observation in the space, what we really think is happening, and.
00:01:56.312 - 00:01:57.698, Speaker C: Pitch that to you guys, see what.
00:01:57.704 - 00:02:32.730, Speaker A: You think, and then we can have a conversation about it. So we believe that the hegemonic approach to human coordination is being challenged as those underserved and disempowered by the current system search for more open, adaptable, and representative policies. So with the emergence of dows, this weird thing that we're all building, decentralized governance and token engineering. We now have this new design space to reengineer incentives and mechanisms. And that's really cool. But the word dows kind of sucks. I mean, really sucks.
00:02:32.730 - 00:03:18.220, Speaker A: It kind of means all of these different things that don't really line up. And so it causes a lot of confusion, it causes a lot of inability to work with each other, and it causes this whole space to be completely not accessible. To anybody who could actually use this technology to solve their problems. These people who are being disempowered and underserved by our traditional power structures, right? So this is just a little bit of the dows that are in the space. We have everything from grant dows to people solving climate change. Dows to people helping political candidates means this self with to the office. And so there's a lot of different things happening, and it's kind of a lot to him.
00:03:18.220 - 00:04:02.474, Speaker A: But one resounding thing that is kind of connecting all of these is that they're kind of envisioning this new way of organization, right? One that wants sustainability over profit, regeneration instead of scarcity, and more cooperative, distributed ways of organizing and working over hierarchical. Did I say that? Right? And centralized ways of working. And this is really fucking cool. This is something that, hey, I'm like, serious. I like this stuff. This is what a lot of people have been working towards for a very long time. So this isn't new to just the people in this room.
00:04:02.474 - 00:04:48.130, Speaker A: This is very new to us, but it's not new to everybody outside this room, is what I was meant to say. So this is a really cool vision, right? This is a very counter hegemonic approach to organization that could serve and empower the people who are being disempowered and underserved right now. So Steve and I wanted to get this space to start talking how we can evolve beyond doubt, beyond this weird little thing that we all really like talking about. And how do we start getting towards that vision of sustainable, regenerative, and cooperative organizations. Right? And so we believe that there's three things that we need to make that happen. One is collaboration. This is something that cannot be done alone.
00:04:48.130 - 00:05:02.678, Speaker A: That's quite obvious. The second is accessibility. So this cannot just be accessible to the people who can come out to Osaka, Japan, for Devcon. This should be something that anybody can access and build with and also common ground.
00:05:02.854 - 00:05:03.818, Speaker C: We kind of have to get on.
00:05:03.824 - 00:05:33.474, Speaker A: The same page about what we're building. And what's really cool is that most of the workshops on dows at Devcon have been around the same concept of how are we getting working within the same language, within the same frameworks. And that's super important for our evolutionary process. So, yeah, that's the basis for this workshop. Eva is going to take it and tell you how we're trying to provide the space to start approaching that counterhedgemonic vision, and we can go from there. Thank you, Abby.
00:05:33.602 - 00:06:19.222, Speaker B: So one of the biggest criticisms I have with Ethereum is that we talk about these buzwords like Dow without thinking about why it might just boost our cloud or ICO, but we haven't really thought about how to apply it into outside of this room and to web two. So people who don't know the word Dow and the people who will never care about the word dow. And so the best way we thought to do this was to collaborate and have people share their learnings. We have several dows represented here, or people working on them. And aside from Twitter, there's not a lot of collaboration. And so this in itself was trying to solve a coordination problem by allowing for that collaboration and talking more about how do we make it more accessible and what should we be thinking about in terms of common ground as a tool set. So Dow itself is not a thing, but things like co ops and savings groups have existed for a while.
00:06:19.222 - 00:06:53.280, Speaker B: And so how do daos play into a larger ecosystem of organization types outside of just this ethereum buzword? And so we have a few prompts here, and I'll go through them exactly what we think you guys should be talking about. Our goal would be if you guys could separate into six groups. And so we have on the walls each of these prompts. And if there are people who don't want to work on the prompts, that's fine. We also recognize this room is massive right now. So if it makes more sense to do it all together, we can do that, although that might be harder. We probably won't get through all of them, but I can start going through them.
00:06:53.280 - 00:07:40.478, Speaker B: So here are the prompts that are on whiteboard. So, firstly, why dows? Why are we here in the first place? Why do we think these are different organization types than, like I mentioned, co ops or savings groups or credit unions? And if they're not different, then how can we start collaborating more with the history that has existed, with experimentation globally and different kinds of developing and developed nations? To dow or not to dao. So a lot of people like to now include the word Dow in everything. I would say that's not always the best use case. And so we want to pin down when is it not right to use a Dao and really think about why are we saying the word Dow? Is it simply for cloud? Or does it actually provide a tool set for us that can improve the.
00:07:40.484 - 00:07:41.630, Speaker A: Way that we organize?
00:07:43.890 - 00:08:57.154, Speaker B: Dow toolkit so aside from the technical infrastructure, what other components are necessary for us to achieve it? So companies like Openlaw are doing a lot of innovation around the legal structure? What other business structure should we have? Are we using the same social tools like discord, et cetera? And if so, that's awesome. But maybe we should be more pinpointed on how we actually need those. There's like a lot of controversy on leadership or project management within a Dow, and you still need those web two tools to achieve the organization that we want within a Dow. So governing dows, how are they different from the existing structures? Do we need identity solutions? What other components do we need to make them successful outside of the civil attack problem? What other problems exist within dows and how can we solve them? Experimentation. So, as I mentioned, there's a lot of people here who are either making dows or part of DAos, and it would be great for everyone to share their learnings. And so something we learned in Molec is like a lot of people are participating in a lot of different dows, but without a fundamental shelling point to communicate that we actually aren't sharing a lot of information. Dow flavors.
00:08:57.154 - 00:09:24.850, Speaker B: So I guess piggybacking a little on the taxonomy Dow workshop earlier today. What are the components of different kinds of dows? What are the different kinds of dows? What are the features that dows should have to be successful? And maybe there's people here who were part of that workshop that would be great to have you guys participate in that. But defining more so the lines between different dow types might make it easier for us to identify what is a dow outside of this vague term.
00:09:28.390 - 00:10:15.150, Speaker A: Cool. So those prompts were created by even I, but also pushed out to the general community in a bunch of Twitter ship hosting that we've been doing. And so we've actually built out those prompts with a lot more, like, guiding questions that can be used to lead the groups, and you'll be able to find those on the hack nd page and the Excel sheet. But so we don't just want you guys to just jump in and have discussions. We want this to be something that is actionable, and so we can pull out these insights and actually apply them back to the community. So what do we want from you? Right. So first, we want you guys to capture and share the key insights from your discussion group through collaborative note sharing, and then actually work together, obviously, and play nicely and engage with each other.
00:10:15.150 - 00:11:03.342, Speaker A: And then we want you guys to present those insights to each other. So we want this to be a quick breakout session where people dive into each of these prompts and then come back together and share these insights. So that means that we're going to have to have one group leader for each group and one person who's taking notes, and those are the two people. So I can't wait to see all those hands volunteer for the groups. That's going to be really great. And then I guess the guiding framework for what we want out of this session, because it's so hard to dive into all of these big topics and have structured conversation, is more of a proposal for frameworks, deliverables, and continued work that can come out of this workshop, that can be worked on with each other, with different groups, and then again pushed back to the community so we can be evolving together. This work only begins here.
00:11:03.342 - 00:11:44.046, Speaker A: This is not something that we believe will stop when it exits this room. Our goal is just to create space for people to come together and have these discussions. And also, we just want you guys to take inspiration and use this as a launchpase for more collaborative discussions around Dao. As Eva said, we have tons of people who are representing the different Dao groups, Dao builders, Daos in general here in this room. So take this time to kind of break down those project silos and have conversations that in real life, not just over Twitter, which is really important. So to talk about logistics. And then I'll take a couple questions just to make sure that we're all on the same page.
00:11:44.046 - 00:12:10.146, Speaker A: We're actually going to be doing our note sharing. If anybody didn't know we have this, like hack and D for Devcon, this is a QR code to get it, or you can just find it through the Devcon app. And we've actually set up the document with all of the different group categories. This is the link when we didn't think that we would have slides. And so this is where we're going to be taking our notes and sharing insights. And this will be accessible by everybody. And again, whoever is volunteering to take notes, do this in the hack.
00:12:10.146 - 00:12:42.334, Speaker A: Indeed. That would be great. So about the group. Okay, so to go back to the original question, we have a really big group of people here. So I want to do a quick check on if people would rather these small working groups where you split into corners, or a larger group discussion that even I facilitate and work through each of the problems. So who wants working group? Raise your hand. Yeah, really high.
00:12:42.334 - 00:12:51.474, Speaker A: Okay, now, who wants larger group discussion? Does anybody want to make the case.
00:12:51.512 - 00:13:01.814, Speaker D: For one or the other, what, 500? That in itself is the case for.
00:13:01.852 - 00:13:02.760, Speaker E: Working group.
00:13:06.410 - 00:13:08.040, Speaker D: Organization right now.
00:13:09.530 - 00:13:12.274, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, guys, I think we're going to go with groups.
00:13:12.322 - 00:13:12.630, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:12.700 - 00:13:21.286, Speaker D: Also, I mean, if a group forms and wants to go somewhere else, if you tell what time we come back, I mean, there's more space in this room for working groups.
00:13:21.398 - 00:13:22.220, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:13:23.070 - 00:13:24.682, Speaker A: Can I just mention that? Yeah.
00:13:24.736 - 00:13:27.406, Speaker B: Just as he said, you don't have to work physically here because this is.
00:13:27.428 - 00:13:28.234, Speaker A: All on half empty.
00:13:28.282 - 00:13:37.394, Speaker B: We'll see all of it. And our goal is to publish all of this as a collaborative effort on some medium of choice with all of your notes and also the frameworks or.
00:13:37.432 - 00:13:38.978, Speaker A: Deliverables that you guys create on how.
00:13:38.984 - 00:14:16.640, Speaker B: To make these easier. Basically, dow itself, a decentralized organization, is not new. We think it's new because we have this new fun thing called a smart contract that allows decentralized coordination. We want to better understand what are the differences and similarities between things like co ops, savings groups, credit unions, et cetera that are very parallel to grant dows or Aragon dows, et cetera. And what are the tools that we need now to make those easier, given that we have this new technology stack that we're using?
00:14:17.010 - 00:14:27.938, Speaker A: All of these prompts are on this excel sheet that you can also access through the hack MD document. So if you want more information on the prompts, you can find them here. So I think that we're going to.
00:14:27.944 - 00:14:48.730, Speaker B: Do, yes, there's stickers on the wall for the group by your prompt, but if you don't want to be in this room, as it is quite packed, as our moderator said, you can leave and then come back. I think coming back at 430 would make sense. We wanted half an hour at the end for discussion and presentation.
00:14:49.310 - 00:15:18.174, Speaker A: Yeah. So let everybody take the time. Now coordinate like the amazing distributed people that you are and divine yourself into one of these six prompts. If you have another prompt and you have a group around you and you want to talk about something else, go ahead. Now is the time. All the information is on the hack MD. All right, guys, let's wrap it up.
00:15:18.174 - 00:15:23.440, Speaker A: Quick thing. If you can add as many attendees, can you add your name?
00:15:25.370 - 00:15:26.120, Speaker E: But.
00:15:29.770 - 00:15:30.520, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:38.090 - 00:15:50.286, Speaker D: I think what I've learned is dows are, dows should be applied like a defense based.
00:15:50.428 - 00:15:51.310, Speaker F: It doesn't.
00:15:53.250 - 00:15:54.670, Speaker D: Hold out of hero.
00:15:57.970 - 00:15:59.040, Speaker F: Might be cool.
00:16:03.970 - 00:16:04.720, Speaker D: Like.
00:16:40.370 - 00:17:15.190, Speaker A: Right, guys, we know you guys like each other so much. That's so great. So excited. If everybody can just take a second, quiet down. I'm gonna give a couple sharing the backup. All right, guys, take a think. We're gonna spend, like, 2025 minutes just discussing our insights.
00:17:15.190 - 00:17:44.794, Speaker A: Please add your name. You still got stragglers in the back. Is everybody listening to my beautiful voice? I hope so. Okay, cool. Hi, guys. That was, from what I heard from those discussions, everything sounded really great. So I'm really excited to hear from all of you guys.
00:17:44.794 - 00:18:04.600, Speaker A: The game plan now is I want each group to nominate one person to come up and share the general key highlights, proposals moving forward, whatever they think is relevant that they want to share with the other groups. Nominate one person and that person is going to have around five minutes or however long that they want.
00:18:12.570 - 00:18:14.434, Speaker B: If you took notes outside of hack.
00:18:14.482 - 00:18:16.022, Speaker A: MD, make sure to put them into.
00:18:16.076 - 00:18:17.978, Speaker B: Hack MD before you leave, because we.
00:18:17.984 - 00:18:49.746, Speaker A: Know some people were taking different notes. Right. I think we have everybody in the room now, so I'm going to repeat those instructions one more time. So one lovely person from each group is going to come up and spend however long, maybe max five minutes, sharing the insights, thoughts, general discussion points that they think is really important for every other group to hear. So I want every group to nominate one person. That person is going to come up here, microphone and have the full attention of the room. So we're going to do that for each group.
00:18:49.746 - 00:19:09.430, Speaker A: I think we ended up only having five groups. So again, this will be probably like 2025 minutes. We'd love for everybody to stay to hear all the insights, and then that's it. Okay, great. Any questions? No? Okay, so who wants to start first? Or should we start one through six inverse, six inverse?
00:19:27.090 - 00:20:01.686, Speaker D: Are you part of the James now? Ours was about the flavors of dows. We basically just tried to go through and think of all the characteristics that could be on off switches or could be scales or sort of about philosophies. And so these different points that make up the flavors of doubt. The first one was the permissionlessness of it. Is it purposely really open and permission, or is it for managing funds for close in that group of people? The permissionlessness of it. The second one, is it for profit, for sustainability? Not at all. And just doing grants.
00:20:01.686 - 00:20:52.026, Speaker D: Right. Where does a given dow sit? The next one was around the number of members. So how many people, again, purposely? Is it small, is it large? Is it meant to scale to a million people? Or is it only meant to be five? The next one that was pretty key was the fund allocation. So is the point of it just to deploy capital in different ways? Or is it how to govern what color to paint my mum's house? The next one was, is the token or not token, right. So that was something I came up to, Andrew wrote down, but does it have a token inside of it? Is that the point to it? Or is there not at all. And it doesn't require it. The other thing, is it focused on sort of like people and open access and creating a better world almost? Or does it have sort of like hard coded in it what the point of it is? Right.
00:20:52.026 - 00:20:59.070, Speaker D: So it should never change and just say like this, or it should develop over time. That immutability of the dow was another one of the flavors.
00:21:01.810 - 00:21:03.022, Speaker E: And then one of the things we.
00:21:03.076 - 00:21:14.686, Speaker D: Talked through was going through dowstat colony, Aragon, Panvala. Nice. And then sort of the Mollite forks and what all those flavors, I don't want to do everyone else's.
00:21:14.718 - 00:21:16.386, Speaker E: I can sort of do those will.
00:21:16.408 - 00:21:27.560, Speaker D: Be on the hack MD. So, yes, the calls for those sort of six different pieces of the puzzle and then also the different companies of how dizzle works.
00:21:33.310 - 00:21:39.594, Speaker A: Anybody want to ask anything for this group or add? No.
00:21:39.792 - 00:21:41.418, Speaker G: What do you plan on for next step?
00:21:41.504 - 00:21:42.282, Speaker D: What's that?
00:21:42.416 - 00:21:44.218, Speaker E: Did you plan on anything for next step?
00:21:44.304 - 00:22:05.990, Speaker D: Oh, jeez. Now you. I think next steps for the different, the flavors of the Dow. I mean, I think we're going to get them up on hacking there maybe sort of expanding out these flavors. I think no one wants to ask a question now, but I'm pretty sure there's other flavors and other attributes that make up a Dow. So contributing to them, I think would be really useful in sort of building out this list and also putting back the community. Right.
00:22:06.060 - 00:22:06.838, Speaker E: Because I think there's a lot of.
00:22:06.844 - 00:22:12.214, Speaker D: Community members that aren't in this room that actually care a lot about dows and sort of understanding how at least.
00:22:12.252 - 00:22:13.046, Speaker E: The people who are in the room.
00:22:13.068 - 00:22:23.094, Speaker D: Are thinking about these ideas and thinking about the different flavors and attributes that make up a Dow is really important. So we'd encourage you to go to the hackmd as well and contribute to the discussion and build out these flavors.
00:22:23.222 - 00:22:24.460, Speaker B: We had one question.
00:22:25.310 - 00:22:49.406, Speaker E: That's not a question, but a comment is because I have, like a crazy idea that you could build Dao around, like a state you have in Dao around crazy things, like, for example, proof of presence or anything else that is important for the given community. So, for example, and have as much say about things related to a thing as many times you attend this conference.
00:22:49.438 - 00:22:50.386, Speaker F: As related to that thing.
00:22:50.408 - 00:22:51.986, Speaker E: Maybe that's not the best measure, but.
00:22:52.008 - 00:22:53.406, Speaker F: You can come out with better measures.
00:22:53.438 - 00:22:56.930, Speaker E: So that doesn't have to be like a value token.
00:22:57.010 - 00:22:57.926, Speaker F: It doesn't have to be.
00:22:57.948 - 00:22:58.678, Speaker D: Anyways, money.
00:22:58.764 - 00:23:00.520, Speaker E: Tough for a seat. Yes.
00:23:01.770 - 00:23:02.520, Speaker A: Cool.
00:23:02.970 - 00:23:03.766, Speaker G: Nice.
00:23:03.948 - 00:23:16.380, Speaker A: Agree. That's what that means. Experimentation. Who's coming up? Announce yourself.
00:23:17.150 - 00:23:18.410, Speaker E: Experimentation.
00:23:22.110 - 00:24:05.958, Speaker F: Hi, I'm Dan Finley, speaking for the experimentation team we spoke on. There were like four themes, major topics. There was what have we learned from past experiments or a variety of past doubt creators in the group? We talked about what we should be cautious of with future endeavors, and then also what do we want to do with future endeavors? And then I've got like in a little assorted category. So for past experiments that were in our group, we had a great photo about gitcoin with their recent CLR model. And so it's based on quadratic application of them. And it may have some questions, open questions about identity verification and things like that. But the last round was very successful.
00:24:05.958 - 00:24:52.010, Speaker F: In particular, 2200 contributions were made. And they noted, Vivek noted that it seemed that a UX improvement that helped people visualize how their vote was really affecting it. It gave this kind of social media windfall of enthusiasm, participation, which was really cool to hear about. There was some conversation about this thing called Lib Dao that I hadn't heard about. It was a plasma scaling dao that it sounded like it had some autonomous reputation enforcement that would penalize people for things as simple as being sick for a week. And so there was this kind of sentiment like sometimes a Dow, you encode things don't reflect the community sentiment. There did seem to be a group sentiment that if the group had agreed to slash reputation, this wouldn't seem so bad, but the fact that somebody just didn't vote for a week felt inhumane.
00:24:52.010 - 00:25:08.074, Speaker F: Then there's some other Dow alluded to that had some private hrvish issue that is now a public vote. And so there's question of how many of these kinds of more human things should be on chain.
00:25:08.122 - 00:25:08.926, Speaker G: In general.
00:25:09.108 - 00:25:39.122, Speaker F: There's a little bit of conversation about adapt PS experiment from the anti pop and status they're curating adapts. It was deliberately designed to avoid voting because voter participation is going to come back to later voter participation. Part problem. Then we're talking about what you should be cautious of when building dows. Actually we have one major thread that kind of dominated here. There was like a question of. It was like politics versus autonomy.
00:25:39.122 - 00:25:51.740, Speaker F: And it kind of ties back into just the theme of autonomy. When we're defining Dao, autonomous is a letter in the word and how important is that into it. There was like testimony from.
00:25:53.630 - 00:25:54.314, Speaker D: I know everybody.
00:25:54.352 - 00:26:21.654, Speaker F: If I'm the founder, I know how to hustle the boats and get an initiative passed. And some people might not want to be a part of a dow that is like that. And there was kind of a conversation about both dows are going to have strong or weak cultures, and maybe the trust minimization in these systems comes from transparency, not the lack of trust system. So those are the experiments. We had another thread about what we should be cautious about.
00:26:21.692 - 00:26:22.230, Speaker E: Oh, sorry.
00:26:22.300 - 00:26:24.310, Speaker F: That was, that was what we should be cautious.
00:26:25.610 - 00:26:25.974, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:26.012 - 00:26:44.246, Speaker F: So can we avoid politics, or is that intrinsic to. I think that was an interesting conversation. And what can we experiment with besides Dao? For one thing, a dow is a set of mechanisms. They can be coupled with norms in a community. Those norms can be self fulfilling and create feedback loops.
00:26:44.278 - 00:26:44.426, Speaker E: Right?
00:26:44.448 - 00:27:02.260, Speaker F: If you've established some norms, like you've got a community that goes one way and flash people, like, obviously you're going to create a self fulfilling kind of community in that way. One concept, you donate on chain and you get, for every dollar you successfully allocate, you get a token and you help oversee the fund. Sounded a lot like Kanbali. She's talking around.
00:27:03.510 - 00:27:04.354, Speaker D: Okay. Yeah.
00:27:04.392 - 00:27:09.366, Speaker F: Anyway, so there's probably a few devotees like that. And then also, what was the last thing?
00:27:09.388 - 00:27:10.066, Speaker E: Oh, other thoughts.
00:27:10.098 - 00:27:22.986, Speaker F: Here's assorted things. Oh yeah, the whole autonomy thread. Can you avoid politics? More dials should think about profiles for users that are participating and gearing the experience towards them. I actually wish I asked for more.
00:27:23.008 - 00:27:24.154, Speaker D: Detail on that because I wasn't clear.
00:27:24.192 - 00:27:50.254, Speaker F: Whether it was like building experience towards profiles of people where letting people represent profile. I'm loosely summarizing that. I didn't fully grock it. Sorry. And then there can be problems with information asymmetry in DAos. When there's people who are curating and stuff, like they might know what are actually good proposals and stuff. There are costs that are non monetary.
00:27:50.254 - 00:28:47.394, Speaker F: The usage kind of comes back to voting costs. So how do you make decisions? What are the real costs? There was a little taxonomy kind of similar to what a group one suggested. Like some are fund allocation vehicles and some are decision making or parameter setting dows. Sometimes legal restrictions can play into dows. So you can either bake that into the incentives and mechanisms that you're considering when designing your dow, or you can just copy and paste bylaws from the existing corporate or governance structures, and you can basically just have those with guaranteed trustless enforcement. There's a little bit of a thread, I think we got a little bit of agreement by the end where it was like dows are kind of just us building rules that are more trustlessly enforced. It seems like we got kind of loose agreement, but there are a couple caveats about whether there was no a DAO cannot have a dictator, and no, a DAO has its rules enforced, trustworthy, and transparency.
00:28:47.394 - 00:29:24.734, Speaker F: So those are two big caveats. That isn't just organization, but voter participation should be required. Should we opt in? There's an idea. What if your lock screen on your phone required you to vote on stuff before you could use it? And yeah, security tokens. There's the notion of, like, maybe you get future revenues for voting. Well, questions about how Dow changes the rules and questions of how do you deal with early members having a dominant reputation in their dow. So should you decay or is it a good thing to have reputation? I don't know.
00:29:24.852 - 00:29:42.790, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyway, yeah. Cool. That's great. Any questions or additions to add to that? That was a really comprehensive list. I'm really excited to read a lot of really good ideas.
00:29:43.610 - 00:29:55.558, Speaker B: The profile thing is kind of interesting, Dan, I guess a comment or what I take away from that is like, we should definitely have, culture is what brings people together. And so profiles are. Culture is a component of profiles.
00:29:55.574 - 00:29:56.554, Speaker C: And so if you have too many.
00:29:56.592 - 00:30:03.440, Speaker B: Heterogeneous people, then it's really hard to actually create culture or like an aligned goal. That's how I'd interpreted that.
00:30:05.730 - 00:30:15.380, Speaker A: Great. That's awesome. Yeah, tons of thoughts there. Okay, cool. So let's move on to governing. Dows governance. Who wants to come tonight? Hey, announce yourself.
00:30:17.430 - 00:30:33.606, Speaker G: Hi, my name is Jason. I'm from Malaysia. And this is John Light. He is from Aragon. Aragon network. So we have a lot of amazing content. Personally, that's what I think in the last 15 minutes.
00:30:33.606 - 00:31:08.834, Speaker G: So we talk about governance. Okay. Reason being is because if the governance model breaks down, then everything basically fucks over. So the first prompt is, should governance be on chain and off chain? Not all should be on chain. It really depends on what you're looking at, where you draw the line. Incentivization models, for example, on a DAo should be on chain. The line is drawn based on what the purpose of the Dow is.
00:31:08.834 - 00:31:42.630, Speaker G: A good example that was brought up was Molok. Dow is a good reference to check out. They are very clear line ETH 2.0 development. Voting should be on chain, and it should be centered around a shared vision. So the second prompt that we went into was, how do we support decentralized governance? Immediately, one of the members said that before anything else, the interface is very important because the current voting itself already sucks. So we need to make the voting experience much more easier for people to come in.
00:31:42.630 - 00:31:50.526, Speaker G: And they said, look at Aragon. Aragon is a good reference to look app. And one of the other members mentioned.
00:31:50.628 - 00:31:51.646, Speaker E: It would be cool if we have.
00:31:51.668 - 00:32:18.540, Speaker G: An app, build a big community and test the concept. And another member mentioned, not only do we need a good interface, we also need a better prompt, how to guide users to make informed decisions, so how we communicate and coordinate so that people will participate and it'll be meaningful. Then we move on to the third prompt, which is.
00:32:21.390 - 00:32:22.300, Speaker F: What is.
00:32:25.230 - 00:32:31.050, Speaker G: Can somebody shout out, what's governance? Yeah, how do you test governance?
00:32:31.130 - 00:32:31.760, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:32.450 - 00:33:55.240, Speaker G: So before we even talk about testing, one member pointed out something very important, which is to first establish what success does look like. Successful governance should match with returns, not necessarily financial returns, but also social wellbeing returns. The fourth prompt that we went into is that how much does dows look and mirror to corporation models? And are there any lessons that we can learn from it? So in the very short time that we have, there was a lot of examples that we can refer to again, social benefit cooperation, donor advisor funds, participatory budgeting, like for example, what's happening in the US Madrid, please feel free. There's all these keywords, keynotes that you can check out later and you can do research on them as well. The fifth prompt is, when do we need to use identity solutions in Dao? So what was brought up was whenever there's quadratic funding or whenever there's one person, one equals one vote, that an identity solution is relevant. Who is working on this? We brought up identity. One of the members point out that when it comes to identity, it really is the holy grail of this subject matter, but we still need to continue to work on it with what we have.
00:33:55.240 - 00:34:46.466, Speaker G: Another member mentioned know, rather than Facebook giving me an identity, why not? We work backwards that a person can basically put in the identity that he wants and then fills it up from there, rather than having the centralized authority giving the identity. That was a very interesting idea. I thought, why couldn't I just use IPFs, put my identity on the blockchain and then build it from there? One other member also brought up. Right, sorry. Identity as one vote can be capitalistic, because when that happens, the more you have, the more power you also have in the voting process. What would be interesting, but more difficult to actually do, is to have identity as one unique person. And as for next steps.
00:34:46.466 - 00:34:47.080, Speaker G: John?
00:34:48.410 - 00:36:03.514, Speaker F: Yeah, great summary. So, yes, the next steps that I pulled out we didn't discuss as a group because we got absorbed into the discussion itself. But some next steps I pulled out of the discussion would be perhaps to develop good information, curation and discussion methods. So first, facilitating a great way to have discussions around decisions that dows are making, but then also to curate that information for people who maybe aren't as engaged in all of the discussions, but who want to contribute to the decision making. Another is delegated voting. I think that kind of follows from that, where if somebody isn't able to make an informed decision, they might be able to delegate their vote to somebody who they trust to make a good decision on their behalf. And along these lines, it would be good to have an easy voting interface that perhaps works with maybe all of the different Dow models so people can see what dows they're a part of and vote really easily.
00:36:03.514 - 00:37:15.400, Speaker F: I think you're going to need delegated voting for that so that they can keep their keys offline and then just vote from keys that are on their phone or something. It would be great to have a unique personhood mechanism to enable ID dependent mechanisms like quadratic funding or quadratic voting that he mentioned earlier. So he mentioned a couple of projects that are working on this, and it would be good to see these integrated directly with dow or voting mechanisms. So like bright ID or identity. And then finally, perhaps we could design some off the shelf models that people could use for low stakes, short run dows so that we can quickly experiment with governance and most importantly, in a diverse set of communities so that we can see how these tools interact with a bunch of different types of cultures and people from different backgrounds and age groups and so on and so forth, in a way where people don't feel like, intimidated by just how much is at stake, but something that could just be quick and fun. But yeah, I think those would all be pretty cool. Next steps to take on as a community.
00:37:21.710 - 00:37:30.854, Speaker B: I just want to address something you said as a next step, which is an easy interface. And actually, dowstack has something called alchemy, which is where all the Daos are housed.
00:37:30.902 - 00:37:33.350, Speaker A: You can participate.
00:37:33.510 - 00:37:46.266, Speaker B: And also vengeance is building something called Dow House, which is where you can access a bunch of the Molok forks and actually do some of the functions from there instead of like a Molok site, something like a rage quiz. So we definitely have these things growing.
00:37:46.298 - 00:37:47.360, Speaker A: In our system.
00:37:52.070 - 00:37:52.962, Speaker E: Where you can access.
00:37:53.016 - 00:37:54.594, Speaker G: All your dowels from all the things.
00:37:54.632 - 00:37:55.346, Speaker E: At the same time.
00:37:55.448 - 00:37:58.778, Speaker F: My Dow dashboard, there's an e Berlin.
00:37:58.814 - 00:38:02.578, Speaker E: Project and the Dow house for launching your own mode.
00:38:02.754 - 00:38:04.166, Speaker B: Launching and access.
00:38:04.348 - 00:38:11.658, Speaker A: Yeah, it'd be cool. Maybe another one is to list these resources so we can all understand and start coordinating between them. That would be really nice.
00:38:11.744 - 00:38:15.274, Speaker D: And that was mentioned on your slide on.
00:38:15.472 - 00:38:21.566, Speaker E: Bring it all this because maybe we.
00:38:21.588 - 00:38:34.510, Speaker G: Could, in fact, somebody from our team, they talked about having a united dows. So imagine that. Don't say United nations.
00:38:37.090 - 00:38:38.334, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Thanks, guys.
00:38:38.372 - 00:38:48.982, Speaker B: That was awesome. I noticed your group hasn't put your notes into the hack and tea.
00:38:49.036 - 00:38:53.750, Speaker A: Please do so so we can capture them. Thank you. Go ahead.
00:38:53.900 - 00:38:56.662, Speaker D: Should we start a new dow to continue with all of this?
00:38:56.716 - 00:39:11.722, Speaker A: Oh, my goodness. Okay. We still have two more to go before we lose all of our attention. This is so awesome. And I'm really enjoying this. So I don't think that the Dow toolkit met, right. Okay, so that one canceled.
00:39:11.722 - 00:39:13.466, Speaker A: So to dow or not to dow.
00:39:13.498 - 00:39:14.730, Speaker B: We talked about ethics.
00:39:14.890 - 00:39:16.000, Speaker A: Come on up.
00:39:16.690 - 00:39:17.760, Speaker C: Announce yourself.
00:39:18.450 - 00:39:24.500, Speaker A: Is this feedback really annoying? Are you guys good? We can cut the mic.
00:39:28.710 - 00:39:30.450, Speaker C: Hi, everybody. I'm Georgia.
00:39:30.950 - 00:39:32.162, Speaker A: We don't have it in a very.
00:39:32.216 - 00:39:50.986, Speaker C: Kind of cohesive manner, but I'm going to go through, we were on or not to dao and there was strong opinions, both sides in our group. Some people, very much like Dao is never a solution for anything all the way up to. We should be using it all the time.
00:39:51.168 - 00:39:52.266, Speaker A: So I'm going to go through some.
00:39:52.288 - 00:40:34.440, Speaker C: Of the points that we brought up. It was a lot around ethical concerns, the main problems that we were addressing and how governance by vote kind of assumes that voters are informed. So there's an ethical problem with assuming that voters are informed. Definitely. When votes are weighted, this could allow for differences and discrepancies in how well a voter is informed as well. So we were looking at whether there's an ethical responsibility to impress upon voters that they should be informed as much as possible, as constantly as possible. And so that comes to information asymmetry, which other people have been talking about already.
00:40:34.440 - 00:41:29.098, Speaker C: We talked about accessibility issues, single issue voters. What about people who only care about one thing and are not going to participate in everything else? What does that do? And most people default to inaction. So what happens when we change this model? We're insisting that they take action in order to participate. And that goes against a lot of behavioral psychology around how people operate. So what is going to motivate them to take part? And who has the privilege to participate all the time? So if taking part in this dow involves you to be constantly voting, who are those people who are going to do that? Maybe not the person with two jobs and many kids. So there's some questions there. And then if you think about, well, if we're going to incentivize people to take part.
00:41:29.098 - 00:42:06.226, Speaker C: What damage does incentivization do? So if it's about gamification, what are people going to do to win the game? Do they really care then about the activity that they're involved in, whether they're voting or not? There's a strong feeling that there's a lack of knowledge generally amongst people building dows about the existing literature out there, specifically around evoting and why evoting is problematic. So I can't remember the name. This guy over here, got lots to talk about that. So talk to him if you want.
00:42:06.248 - 00:42:08.740, Speaker A: To learn more about that bill.
00:42:09.770 - 00:43:07.240, Speaker C: So I'm a user researcher, so I care about understanding the needs of users. And I think we should be speaking to people who we're building for to understand their problems and their motivations, rather than just building it and seeing who will come. And that's a good way of addressing the ethics there, too. So yes, another things that we could look at is if it's for communities, all communities, specifically marginalized populations as well, we could be understanding the reasons why people now don't vote. If we could solve that problem and understand that and address it, then that could probably then solve for all the people who do also want to vote as well. So you can have higher participation there and also understand why people are voting for the wrong reasons, too. So there was feeling that the scope of current Dow seems a bit too large.
00:43:07.240 - 00:44:29.570, Speaker C: And we came to the conclusion that in order for a dow to really make sense, you need a group of people who have in common a desire to collaborate, cooperate and have accessibility to do this thing. If one of these three things is missing, then it's probably not right to have a Dow for it. There is definitely feeling that where a Dow is addressing something really life changing, where the proposals could mean life or death or significant effects for people's lives. We are not ready right now to be addressing any of those kind of problems and thinking about what is the risk to a person who leaves a dow. Is there a risk to them in any way, too? We talked just a little bit more about just because this was brought up, the idea of could you get someone to vote in order to unlock their phone? Well, what we might end up doing is in order to incentivize people to take part in dows, we could be building in the same manipulative design practices from web two applications in order to get people to vote. So there's an ethical question around there as to whether we really want to be doing that. Do we want to make it a game so that people participate if they don't actually really care of the outcome.
00:44:29.570 - 00:44:38.840, Speaker C: I think that's about it, but we're going to put our notes in. Thanks everyone in our group. You put your name on this thing, I'll hand it around. Thank you.
00:44:50.170 - 00:44:56.378, Speaker D: So do you have any thoughts on this whole idea of precautionary principle? In what cases is okay?
00:44:56.544 - 00:45:02.686, Speaker C: Yes, we came up with the idea that small communities around single issues are.
00:45:02.708 - 00:45:04.078, Speaker A: The first place right now.
00:45:04.164 - 00:45:25.010, Speaker C: So particularly groups who can muster around a problem together and solve it that way. So I think there were some examples. Let's organize access to water for your community, for example, or protect this land, something which is a direct purpose and not very contentious.
00:45:27.510 - 00:45:32.694, Speaker A: Great. Thanks, guys. Any others? Did I see a hand?
00:45:32.812 - 00:45:52.814, Speaker E: No, it would have been an answer or a question. Maybe blockchains are interesting for social scalability to some extent. And maybe those kind of organizations in small complete communities would need a blockchain. And maybe you can organize with the.
00:45:52.852 - 00:45:54.026, Speaker D: Face to face interaction.
00:45:54.058 - 00:46:01.226, Speaker E: Yes, maybe that's the interest in you. That is, take those structures and scale them up for larger.
00:46:01.338 - 00:46:12.260, Speaker C: Well, there was a question that we had in our group, which is if this is already working effectively within a small community by whatever method they have, then why complicated by adding a.
00:46:15.050 - 00:46:15.750, Speaker D: Trust?
00:46:15.900 - 00:46:17.400, Speaker C: What if they trust each other?
00:46:22.170 - 00:46:37.814, Speaker B: There's a question of whether we're all building to create the US and blockchains easier. But are there actual tools that a blockchain can provide to help this community even if they're doing okay? Is there something else that this technology brings that would improve the coordination it requires?
00:46:37.862 - 00:46:47.834, Speaker C: Behavior change. And behavior change is the hardest thing to get people to do. So right now the barriers to entry is way too high. That's what we should be addressing.
00:46:47.962 - 00:46:59.410, Speaker A: Yeah, and maybe finding the use cases and the places where people are ready to make that behavioral change, but not so much focusing on the ones where they're not ready for it yet and analyzing that, which is a really good.
00:46:59.480 - 00:47:00.100, Speaker B: Point.
00:47:04.070 - 00:47:06.946, Speaker A: I think tools like Lumio, I don't know how many people are familiar.
00:47:06.978 - 00:47:12.600, Speaker B: With Lumio where it's basically interface for voting. I feel like that's very good for.
00:47:13.530 - 00:47:15.126, Speaker C: Small group of people who trust each.
00:47:15.148 - 00:47:18.082, Speaker A: Other and have some kind of capacity.
00:47:18.146 - 00:47:20.098, Speaker B: Let'S say, or like kind of experience interface.
00:47:20.194 - 00:47:21.814, Speaker A: So that still definitely seems a lot.
00:47:21.852 - 00:47:23.878, Speaker C: But I find that non blockchain tools.
00:47:23.894 - 00:47:26.506, Speaker B: That are also very similar to what they would scale up to be are.
00:47:26.528 - 00:47:27.702, Speaker A: Really good onboarding tools.
00:47:27.766 - 00:47:34.750, Speaker B: So I'd always start with a small group with Lumia before I kind of move on to something that has gas transactions, et cetera.
00:47:36.370 - 00:47:38.314, Speaker A: But it's really good, like paper prototyping.
00:47:38.362 - 00:47:45.358, Speaker E: And Lumio has another very cool advantage that we actually shoot, maybe model after talk about. It's not just made for photo, it's.
00:47:45.374 - 00:47:46.900, Speaker F: Made for sense making around.
00:47:48.630 - 00:48:05.080, Speaker E: Geared around finding a better collective solution than any individual solution. And that could be something we should be thinking about instead of, yes, no binary things. But at the same time, I can argue that no, we should keep it warm and simple. Yes, no binary thing.
00:48:06.090 - 00:48:22.046, Speaker D: Yeah. On talking about the behavioral change as well. I think a really interesting idea behind that is that when you look at governance right now as a space, we try to be pretty well as this community, at least. We try to be pretty anti money. Let's do that. But I think when you look at governance right now, money plays a huge role. Right.
00:48:22.046 - 00:48:40.274, Speaker D: You're the US president, you get paid bajillion dollars and then you get a bajillion dollars forever. Right. But every year of your life and these whole governance structures that have been built up and financed around that, I think that's from the Moloch thing. That's what's going on with Peter at the moment. Right. Peter's been pushing Moloch for a long time and only now has he received the first check for actually, well, you got. Right.
00:48:40.274 - 00:48:56.786, Speaker D: Yeah. That happened. And that's really important. Right. And I think the people that are coordinating these dows and the bureaucracy we build into these systems, there needs to be financial backing behind them because otherwise things won't happen. And I think right now, dows don't incentivize people enough to get involved.
00:48:56.898 - 00:48:57.174, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:57.212 - 00:49:11.830, Speaker B: That brings up the interesting question of like, are we actually changing the way that our organizations work? People still need to be paid for the work of even creating or coordinating a Dow. And we have this contrarian view that there's no leaders in dows when there are fundamental leaders and they should also be compensated.
00:49:11.990 - 00:49:16.282, Speaker A: But then also we have the ability to capture value in different ways than traditional profit structures.
00:49:16.346 - 00:49:16.526, Speaker E: Right.
00:49:16.548 - 00:49:26.686, Speaker A: So now we also have the opportunity to redesign the incentives, which is really nice because we get to create a new way for people to be rewarded and to capture work for their labor.
00:49:26.798 - 00:49:46.070, Speaker D: Then why do we call it Dow? I just think that we are using a wrong name. And by calling it Dow, then we're going to have a person that is going to be leading the efforts. It's not really decentralized.
00:49:46.410 - 00:49:48.826, Speaker E: The leader could change every second.
00:49:48.928 - 00:49:49.194, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:49:49.232 - 00:49:57.530, Speaker F: Someone has to do something. I wouldn't say it's.
00:50:01.870 - 00:50:02.570, Speaker D: A big difference.
00:50:02.640 - 00:50:06.298, Speaker G: Between leadership and control. And so you can have leadership is informed.
00:50:06.314 - 00:50:36.360, Speaker D: That's a great point. I wouldn't say it's like wrong, but I agree. Dow is a term that's much broader than what each specific implementation indicates. Each implementation and the community that forms, the culture that forms around each implementation, you could describe each as either a company or co op or some sort of threat. Dow, though, is kind of this blanket. Yeah, but it's called decentralized, right? Yeah, no, I agree.
00:50:39.690 - 00:50:44.074, Speaker B: If you want to be speaking, then talking about the autonomous is not making sense.
00:50:44.192 - 00:50:49.900, Speaker D: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. That we're using the wrong naming convention. That's exactly what I'm saying.
00:50:56.030 - 00:50:57.610, Speaker A: Let's make this coordinated.
00:51:00.350 - 00:51:01.518, Speaker D: Centralization that I.
00:51:01.524 - 00:51:06.434, Speaker F: Think sometimes is grouping of one thing. You can have decentralized financing models and.
00:51:06.472 - 00:51:08.382, Speaker D: Also have some type of leadership.
00:51:08.446 - 00:51:20.294, Speaker F: You can have decentralization of leadership, but actual centralization of funding. So I think it's a bit of a mystery. I could say if there is leadership, it's not decentralized because we see the same thing on layer one.
00:51:20.332 - 00:51:20.582, Speaker D: Right.
00:51:20.636 - 00:51:24.406, Speaker F: You're going to decentralized node structures and still have centralization because it's all on.
00:51:24.428 - 00:51:25.910, Speaker G: AWS or something like that.
00:51:25.980 - 00:51:28.134, Speaker E: So I agree if you do say.
00:51:28.172 - 00:51:29.566, Speaker G: That it needs to be maybe a.
00:51:29.568 - 00:51:31.946, Speaker D: Little more nuanced, but I see where you're coming from.
00:51:32.128 - 00:51:33.420, Speaker A: I saw one. Right?
00:51:34.590 - 00:51:40.540, Speaker D: Yeah, I see the letters D and a have more to do with the medium than.
00:51:44.930 - 00:52:03.054, Speaker B: I would also add that leader doesn't imply that the leader has more decision making power as much as it is who is executing who is taking up the trash. Doesn't mean they're the ones deciding where the trash is going. I think also we don't have to compact everything into a Dow.
00:52:03.102 - 00:52:03.314, Speaker A: Right.
00:52:03.352 - 00:52:08.834, Speaker B: We don't need to say that a participatory or horizontal or collaborative organization has to be a dow.
00:52:08.882 - 00:52:11.714, Speaker A: There's value in these potentially separately.
00:52:11.842 - 00:52:26.170, Speaker B: And also, I think we have to your point, we also need to acknowledge that back end labor happens to organize and socialize and create the communications around how you implement a Dow or a horizontal organization. We want to honor that labor, however.
00:52:26.240 - 00:52:27.340, Speaker C: We want to do it.
00:52:29.630 - 00:52:31.178, Speaker D: Just to back on this, because I.
00:52:31.184 - 00:52:33.518, Speaker E: Think we have a broader problem at.
00:52:33.524 - 00:52:37.198, Speaker D: Hand, which you're looking to edition like we are open source space.
00:52:37.284 - 00:52:37.678, Speaker E: Right.
00:52:37.764 - 00:52:45.146, Speaker D: So there are people here that are contributing with work which we cannot remunerate based on the work produced.
00:52:45.258 - 00:52:45.774, Speaker F: Kind of.
00:52:45.812 - 00:52:46.302, Speaker E: Right.
00:52:46.436 - 00:52:48.226, Speaker D: Because they can't cooperate so we have.
00:52:48.248 - 00:52:50.146, Speaker G: To come up, we fucking have to.
00:52:50.168 - 00:52:51.742, Speaker E: Come up with a way to reward.
00:52:51.806 - 00:53:08.386, Speaker D: People who are contributing to the common good. And I think that if we do it for ourselves, then it might be easier to come to other people and let them know we figured out for ourselves. Because we already hear people talking about licensing, coding on Ethereum. Go to Diehouse and join the raid.
00:53:08.418 - 00:53:09.110, Speaker G: Guild.
00:53:10.890 - 00:53:16.810, Speaker F: Just to experiment on that exact thing. If you want to try to work together, to work on how we can do that right now.
00:53:16.880 - 00:53:17.820, Speaker D: What's the name?
00:53:20.510 - 00:53:21.770, Speaker F: Don't call it a dow.
00:53:22.350 - 00:53:45.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we still have one more group. So this discussion is so amazing. What would be so cool? If people have other thoughts that they want to contribute, please put it in the hack and we can continue this discussion. But that's really awesome. Thank you, everybody, for participating. But we still have one more group, and I want to give them the opportunity to say all their things. So why dows? I mean, this is great that we're ending on number one, basically what the fuck we're talking about.
00:53:45.780 - 00:53:49.400, Speaker A: So come on up, announce yourself, and then.
00:53:53.450 - 00:53:54.326, Speaker D: Thank you, guys.
00:53:54.428 - 00:54:20.334, Speaker E: David, you can call me dog. I like dog more dog. Keep my identities in check. So, yeah, we've been meandering between three different kind of things about the state of the Daos right now. So we discussed a lot about Molokdao, about the rated Rojan Dao, all those. We also talked a lot about the old failures of the Daos, and we also talked about what Daos could do.
00:54:20.372 - 00:54:22.158, Speaker G: If we just envision this great future.
00:54:22.244 - 00:54:57.706, Speaker E: Where we don't have all this shit. We only have the dows and they do what we want, even though we don't know what we want. What I'm saying is it was a very difficult discussion to put into key points. So I'll just give you what we have. So first key point, we had a consensus that offline and online communities really require deep relationships and most often trust as well. And we weren't really sure if it is possible to just model the trust away and just find a mechanism that we can just not have the trust. So it's definitely something that any discussion about dows will be getting back into.
00:54:57.706 - 00:55:21.406, Speaker E: We also found several use cases. You can find them in the hack MD. I'll just read some of them. So one of the biggest use cases we had was that dows allow, and that's a claim, dows allow, sidestepping the current structures that force organizations. Just ignore DAOs as a structure into this binary decision. Are we doing this for profit.
00:55:21.438 - 00:55:22.114, Speaker G: Are we doing this?
00:55:22.152 - 00:56:02.880, Speaker E: Not for profit. So our claim is we can use DAOs to kind of enable the spectrum in between these two. And like somebody from the middle said a few minutes ago that we can also really decide whether we want to have the spectrum more on the funding side, more on the governance side. Decentralized oath. We want to have this fluent. And another claim that we make is that dows, because they are kind of shared software stack, enable fluency in all of that. And this is what we believe is one of the key points for anyone who's investigating Dow, that this fluency in the structures is one of the key, so to speak, selling points that we're all somehow subconsciously hoping for.
00:56:02.880 - 00:56:13.582, Speaker E: What else do we have here? Oh yeah. One of the typical use cases is governance of decentralized projects using dows. You all know a few projects that simply are Daos and they self organize.
00:56:13.646 - 00:56:14.994, Speaker G: And I guess they don't give a.
00:56:15.032 - 00:56:21.000, Speaker E: Rat'S ass about legal implications because why would you. I'm with them. I'm with them.
00:56:22.730 - 00:56:24.198, Speaker G: What else we have here?
00:56:24.364 - 00:57:09.320, Speaker E: Yeah, obviously a new means to capture value and enable value creation with less social and legal friction. I'm not really sure if this is the case in all cases. That's why we actually are having this workshop, I guess, to just enable these design patterns that will make it easier for future generations of conscious people to design those just in a better way. And a big claim we had, accessibility is still not very equally distributed. I mean, there are populations that are not online, and there are populations that do not know that you can actually have an organization on the Internet. There are people who are unaware that forums exist. That's a problem that is just going to, in my opinion, personal opinion, solve itself with time, with the development of the digital space in general.
00:57:09.320 - 00:57:59.800, Speaker E: One claim that we had as well is that dows provide digital interface to a social process that often or in the past was hidden. So, for instance, there was this example of the Yang dao. Or if we just imagine we have a more advanced version of that, which is actually a super PAC, you could kind of see what's going on in a social system that you normally wouldn't even be able to see. You wouldn't be able to see results, outcomes of that system. But now you can just go online, or in the future you could go online and just check what's going on, who's voting. Maybe if you cannot attribute individual identities to individual votes, you can still see what's going on without having to ask your immediate surrounding social network. So maybe we can actually gain some sort of super transparency that is not really something that humans have had in the past.
00:57:59.800 - 00:58:13.654, Speaker E: And. Anything to add, guys and gals? Oh no, the gal went to, I guess that's it mostly, I think. Do we have some time for open discussion?
00:58:13.702 - 00:58:18.410, Speaker A: Yeah. Anybody have any other questions? Why are we all here?
00:58:18.560 - 00:58:20.140, Speaker B: Why doubt for you guys?
00:58:23.490 - 00:58:28.506, Speaker G: Some people are all about new. Okay, some people are all about new kinds of governance.
00:58:28.618 - 00:58:30.554, Speaker E: I say governance is boring.
00:58:30.682 - 00:58:34.900, Speaker G: What I care about is new kinds of money blockchains allow you to do.
00:58:35.590 - 00:58:36.900, Speaker E: Tokens are great.
00:58:39.350 - 00:58:40.690, Speaker D: Government sucks.
00:58:42.150 - 00:58:43.650, Speaker E: Solve more profits.
00:58:45.830 - 00:59:05.018, Speaker D: So for me, why doubts is that you can contribute around a shared mission. If you were a company with shareholders or nonprofits, very hard to contribute. And because I come from insurance background and insurance as it is, because it's shareholder value maximizing, whereas traditionally it's always been about helping the community as a.
00:59:05.024 - 00:59:06.474, Speaker E: Whole and why you have people.
00:59:06.592 - 00:59:25.282, Speaker D: But that structure is very limiting for it to scale up shareholder. So whether or not you can work. But it's exploring a new way to sort of push a mission that benefits the society as a whole versus one.
00:59:25.336 - 00:59:27.410, Speaker G: Or person or one entity.
00:59:27.750 - 00:59:52.070, Speaker E: Adding to that, I think that's also to discuss local community example. I believe that there can be a nice set up even if you have a trust and you have that knowledge between people and common goal, like to create mechanics where you can coordinate decisions and also make it from people from outside the bubble. This is like a more general parallel.
00:59:53.070 - 01:00:46.790, Speaker G: I like the second one, which is basically when you have a daO, it's really about taking trust to the next level. Not only has blockchain given us cryptocurrencies where we have a trustless monetary system, but now we can delegate the trust and we can see change in places where traditionally we are not seeing change. Like for example, my personal interest is in renewable energy. I'm very frustrated. I don't believe that the large corporations and the governments will work together to transition us to 100%. So what if we have a dow that basically collects funds to give out loans for people who actually want to install solar panels and we don't compromise that. It's free from corruption, it's free from manipulation.
01:00:46.790 - 01:00:51.020, Speaker G: Shared vision. Basically, the money goes to where it is.
01:00:53.870 - 01:01:38.246, Speaker D: Yeah, a bit conscious that to me it's saying that this might be sort of, but it's kind of like reinventing the wheel in some respect. And it was a good point just from someone in our group who works already in organizations where they do have these mechanisms already I think it's cool for us to play with it. And that was the point we came to, that it's kind of good to experiment and learn the lingo, and to me, so I've been great in doing that. And then when I go to an organization and do the same thing, it's like, oh, yeah, they were just doing that in a digital form. I just kind of wonder the advantages. So for some who are coming from the digital space, it gives them more exposure to these processes. And I think for those who aren't already involved in that process and can do that in a community project, say they'll have their own perspective.
01:01:38.246 - 01:02:07.220, Speaker D: They'll just feel like they're part of the process. And if these digital tools can give good visibility of where a vote goes and say, oh, I voted on that, and then now I have a fountain built for my community or something that's a positive side to it. I'm sort of torn to say there will be an element of reinventing the wheel to get familiar and play with it a bit, but hopefully there is something that we're leaving before adding to it that is saying, here is the tangible benefits. I think it's there, but.
01:02:10.730 - 01:02:20.726, Speaker A: I love that, guys. I think we're going to cut it right there. That was a great inspirational way to assist that. So thank you so much. We are already at 530, so we've gone over. Thank you so much for spending this.
01:02:20.748 - 01:02:21.542, Speaker B: Much time with us.
01:02:21.596 - 01:02:49.770, Speaker A: Please add any thoughts to hack MD. Even I are going to be taking this and putting something out into the community. So also, stay tuned. This is our Twitter. But again, thank you guys so much for your raise. Here's.
