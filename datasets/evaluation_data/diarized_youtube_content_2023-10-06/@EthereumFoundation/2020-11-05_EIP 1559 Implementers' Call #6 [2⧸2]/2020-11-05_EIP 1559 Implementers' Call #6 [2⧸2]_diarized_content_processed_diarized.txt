00:00:00.250 - 00:00:26.086, Speaker A: The public testnet. So this is similar to our recent discussion on Robson. So if we create a public testnet like this, and even if we set the difficulty to something very low, then anyone can actually start mining on this and raise the difficulty very quickly and cause trouble. So will we limit the block miners by IP or by adding some signature and extra data? One of the two we have to.
00:00:26.108 - 00:00:39.750, Speaker B: Do, or just restart it every. My suggestion is to aggressively restart the chain and move it every time you restart.
00:00:39.910 - 00:00:40.186, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:40.208 - 00:00:41.770, Speaker B: And I guess following.
00:00:43.550 - 00:01:02.798, Speaker C: Like once we have a solution for think and we've tested it on Robson, I would be fine moving it there. But just in the meantime to get this out ASAP, I'd also be in favor of restarting the chain more frequently than trying to solve this problem as like a blocker to getting this testnet out.
00:01:02.964 - 00:01:13.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Restarting the chain here, we cannot restart the Robson, but we can restart this testnet. So there should be no attack. Or maybe if it start being the problem, then we can do something.
00:01:13.544 - 00:01:14.260, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:16.230 - 00:01:37.260, Speaker B: Probably good to just have a simple process that allows the people who involved to easily coordinate for where the new chain is because you have to be able to find it and you don't want the attacker to be able to automatically move. So you just want some just human process that you just all agree. Okay, we'll post it in this private channel or whatever the chain id.
00:01:38.270 - 00:01:44.880, Speaker C: We can use the 1559 discord. And if that becomes a problem, we can use a chat between.
00:01:46.770 - 00:01:53.018, Speaker B: Just something that's not easily automated for the attacker to automatically follow. Like they have to be a human paying attention sitting around.
00:01:53.204 - 00:02:02.770, Speaker C: Good point. Yeah. So let's start with the fee market channel and if that gets compromised, we can find something more robust.
00:02:04.150 - 00:02:04.900, Speaker B: Sure.
00:02:06.790 - 00:02:09.202, Speaker C: Okay, sorry, go ahead.
00:02:09.336 - 00:02:20.490, Speaker D: Yeah, I have a question about JSON RPC. So do we need to expose two additional fields on transaction structure on ETh? Get transaction by hash endpoint?
00:02:21.390 - 00:02:34.220, Speaker E: Yes, this is a plan. Yeah, I will write those four eips. I already wrote eips for the block data. And I will write eips for the transaction data.
00:02:35.070 - 00:02:42.800, Speaker D: Yeah, we exposed that, but we checked it with Onbeso and on beso it's returned the old.
00:02:43.190 - 00:02:50.500, Speaker E: Yeah, we still not have implemented get transaction by hash. Yeah.
00:02:54.710 - 00:02:56.200, Speaker C: Okay. Anything else?
00:02:56.650 - 00:02:57.446, Speaker D: No.
00:02:57.628 - 00:03:16.540, Speaker C: Okay, cool. Yeah, so on the testnets we have the poa. We said we'll finish that. I think we did do this, right, Abdel? We did run the base one. This one's done. And then these two, we're basically combining into the fork of main net.
00:03:19.790 - 00:03:20.154, Speaker B: And.
00:03:20.192 - 00:03:53.270, Speaker C: Then I guess, yeah, other testing. So nethermind, you mentioned you're using 1559 as part of a client network. Filecoin also has 1559. Near protocol also has it. I should link dare a bit, had the write up about it. And then from silo they're also working on 1559, and they mentioned they can kind of help for testing with our work if there's overlap. But their implementation is slightly different from Ethereum's.
00:03:53.270 - 00:04:49.610, Speaker C: So I'm talking with them to see if there's anything where there's a lot of value for them to contribute. If people have ideas about testing that is kind of falling through the cracks and where not having exactly the same implementation can be valuable, please ping me. And then. Yeah, just on the r D side, I guess. In terms of theoretical analysis for the eeps since the last call, the biggest change is Vitalik put together some slides about 1559 that were quite good. So if people want to have a look at that to give a good overview, and then in terms of comparing 1559 with the alternatives, I linked your notebook here, Barnabay, and then Barnabay, in terms of simulations on the last call, you mentioned a couple more things. So I've just linked them there for people to be aware.
00:04:49.610 - 00:05:46.780, Speaker C: And then the final bit is the community outreach. So we shared already we've done a report with the cat herders about people's thoughts on 1559. We're continuing to do more outreach, mostly around wallets and exchanges. It's going a bit slower now, so I'm not sure exactly when we'll have an update on this, but it's kind of happening in the background and that's basically all I had on the agenda. Is there anything else that people feel we should bring? Share? Well, I guess we'll have a full transcript for this. I'll share an update on Twitter today. And I guess the big things are just continuing to work on the tooling, getting the work started on the testnet, and trying to specify this transaction pool behavior.
00:05:46.780 - 00:05:52.590, Speaker C: We have another call scheduled in four weeks. Does that seem reasonable in terms of timeline for people?
00:05:56.680 - 00:05:57.710, Speaker D: Yeah, us.
00:05:58.560 - 00:06:03.870, Speaker C: Okay, cool. Well, yeah, thanks everybody for joining. Appreciate you all taking the time.
00:06:04.240 - 00:06:05.928, Speaker E: Thank you. Bye.
00:06:06.104 - 00:06:06.760, Speaker D: Thanks. Bye.
