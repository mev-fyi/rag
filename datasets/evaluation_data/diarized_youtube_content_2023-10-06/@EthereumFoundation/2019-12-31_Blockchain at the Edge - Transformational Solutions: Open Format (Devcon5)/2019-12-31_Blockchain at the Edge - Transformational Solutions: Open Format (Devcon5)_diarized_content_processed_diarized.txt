00:00:17.370 - 00:00:21.710, Speaker A: And I will have you stop talking for a moment and then I'll get you all talking again.
00:00:21.780 - 00:00:22.960, Speaker B: Sorry about that.
00:00:23.730 - 00:00:25.078, Speaker A: Hello, good morning.
00:00:25.204 - 00:00:25.880, Speaker B: Welcome.
00:00:26.730 - 00:01:20.466, Speaker A: This is blockchain at the edge day two. My name is Hadosta Damian. I'm a facilitator with consensus. We will talk at you for as short a time as possible so that you can talk to each other. What we started with yesterday was a two and a half hour session where we had about 50, 60 people through the room thinking through some specific ideas, use cases and information around instances where we might use blockchain for social impact. Or as like american scholar Bell Hook says, moving the margin to the center. So thinking about instances of where we're going to use blockchain, that might be for people who experience marginalization, but actually making that the center, the focus of what we're doing as opposed to an edge.
00:01:20.466 - 00:01:52.838, Speaker A: Right. So what we're going to do real quick is we are going to orient you all to where we left off yesterday. We're going to break into groups by interest area so you can keep sharing with each other. We will also have an other new interest area. If anything that we were working on doesn't interest you, we're going to have a little time for thinking, ideation, things like that. Then we're going to share back as a group. And the goal of what we're doing over the week is to build on each other's thinking and grow our learning collective.
00:01:52.838 - 00:02:06.370, Speaker A: So I will invite somebody who was in, who was in this group to talk about where the ideas around finance and financial autonomy landed.
00:02:06.870 - 00:02:10.498, Speaker B: Okay, what we did yesterday is.
00:02:10.664 - 00:02:30.542, Speaker C: So I'm Tati Mehraying. I'm also a consensus and I'm also with women in blockchain. Anyways, so in this area, we talked about financial issues and how we can resolve them and what they might be. Right? And so we ended up zooming in.
00:02:30.676 - 00:02:31.360, Speaker A: On.
00:02:34.850 - 00:03:29.130, Speaker C: Two main issues that came up, one being access, not having financial access. For example, let's say in Kenya, somebody was here who was talking about a project helping people by creating circular economies. So that would mean creating access for people who otherwise wouldn't have access by providing basically tokenization of assets, but then making them liquid. Right. Being able to exchange them by having a token. And that way you could exchange them and that token wouldn't come from, like, wouldn't have to be paid for. So therefore, it's creating a value chain that didn't exist before versus another issue in the financial category being, for example, countries in financial crisis where the money is devalued.
00:03:29.210 - 00:03:31.950, Speaker B: So what you have is going away.
00:03:32.100 - 00:03:38.706, Speaker C: And also countries under sanctions, right. You earn your money and somehow you.
00:03:38.728 - 00:03:39.890, Speaker B: Have no control over it.
00:03:39.960 - 00:04:25.458, Speaker C: So that ended up being, the main topics were being about ownership and access. Right. And so one of the learnings was that in some ways, the proposed solution to create liquidity, it was kind of like everybody becomes their own little central bank. Could be, when it's scaled, be the old system. Right. And this would actually be exactly what we're trying to find alternatives for. While on the other hand, creating a system like, let's say, for example, bitcoin, to be able to maintain control over your finances, could also prevent access.
00:04:25.458 - 00:05:16.906, Speaker C: So this is where we landed at the very end that we had these two topics around finance, and that potentially the solution for one part of the problem could recreate the old system, and the solution for the other part of the problem could maintain the original problem. And so we haven't gotten further than that, but we also came up with a couple of ideas that have to be requirements. And they were like features like being permissionless, being tamper proof, being trustless, being accessible, being global, and building an ecosystem and providing interoperability. So anybody who is interested in this area later should join on this side. I'm giving over back to. All right, thank you, Patty.
00:05:16.938 - 00:05:18.098, Speaker B: All right, so for folks who are.
00:05:18.104 - 00:05:24.030, Speaker A: Just joining us, welcome, welcome. We are orienting to where we left off with our problems and ideas yesterday.
00:05:24.110 - 00:05:24.994, Speaker B: And we're going to get you into.
00:05:25.032 - 00:05:32.134, Speaker A: Working groups in a few minutes. But first, I'm going to hand you over to Alique, who will talk a little bit about another problem area we were working on.
00:05:32.252 - 00:05:46.460, Speaker D: Hi, I'm alique Kellis. So yesterday, same as Cessi was saying, that very small problem we were trying to solve for was IDs, lack of IDs, decentralized identities in general.
00:05:46.830 - 00:05:48.266, Speaker B: Not a small problem.
00:05:48.448 - 00:06:36.154, Speaker D: Very hard to start to a solution against that. But we synthesize it down to a couple of areas, and they are undocumented migrants. Refugee and asylum seekers need protected, verifiable, transferable identification because of access to social services. Formal work and protection are contingent on an ID. That was the problem statement we came up with. And the second one we came up with was without the ability to own ID, children, elders, mentally ill, sick need the ability to determine who is responsible for and able to act on behalf of them and their ID because these.
00:06:36.192 - 00:06:37.974, Speaker A: Peoples are the most vulnerable.
00:06:38.102 - 00:06:47.230, Speaker D: So again, vulnerable communities that need to be centered and less on the edge. So we got this topical.
00:06:47.970 - 00:06:49.450, Speaker B: We grouped around this topic.
00:06:49.530 - 00:06:58.306, Speaker D: There's other issues here. Again, if you're kind of an ID person, personally, I'm more of like a track and trace person, but no one.
00:06:58.328 - 00:07:03.314, Speaker B: Wanted to do that yesterday. So I ended up with ID and.
00:07:03.352 - 00:07:07.560, Speaker D: I'm like, okay, so have fun to party with me over here.
00:07:09.290 - 00:07:23.998, Speaker A: Thank you, Elise. The final issue area that we jammed on yesterday was on governance, but in particular, thinking about co ops as dows question marks.
00:07:24.034 - 00:07:24.330, Speaker C: Right?
00:07:24.400 - 00:08:13.866, Speaker A: Like using a really grounded example of cooperative businesses and centralized autonomous organizations. Some of our big ideas were around what it meant to allocate scarce public resources fairly, how many ways welcome, how we could impact the supply chain positively, and how we might combat corruption and monopolies to help small businesses and to help individuals who are small businesses. So one of the problem statements that we landed on, let's see if I can read it from here. Farmers and co op need a method to distribute value from its field efficiently and fairly, because often smaller farmers are not treated fairly, there's a problem.
00:08:13.968 - 00:08:14.282, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:14.336 - 00:09:13.680, Speaker A: And then we also pulled back and had a few more abstracted problem statements around decision makers or leaders in organizations needing to be able to make decisions in ways that are transparent. Right. So if you want to think about how cooperative and how governance might support small businesses being more efficient and fair for small business owners, you jam over here. You'll see that we have a fourth area. Right. If talking about decision making in small business and governance for co op or Ie or financial control and ownership or currently doesn't appeal to you, you are going to go to the other area and we will generate topics there. So in a moment, when I say go, you're all going to stand up and move and find a seat or bring over a seat with you into the area that you would like to talk about and work on for the next 40 minutes or so.
00:09:14.130 - 00:09:28.260, Speaker C: So again, is everybody clear on every one of the topics? Because I know some of you came in late. Financial is related to financial accessibility and maintaining the assets you have.
00:09:28.710 - 00:09:30.850, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. Cool.
00:09:31.000 - 00:09:47.910, Speaker A: So, financial accessibility, governance and cooperative organization ID and positive digital security. I don't want to talk about any of those. Let's talk about something else.
00:09:47.980 - 00:09:54.154, Speaker C: If you have a burning topic in your mind, you always wanted to talk about and you wanted to get other people around, go here, propose it.
00:09:54.192 - 00:09:55.340, Speaker E: What about talking?
00:09:57.470 - 00:09:58.422, Speaker B: They are related.
00:09:58.486 - 00:10:05.200, Speaker C: You're totally right. Financial is related to ID. They're all related. We have only an hour, right?
00:10:06.770 - 00:10:08.522, Speaker A: Let's get people talking in groups.
00:10:08.586 - 00:10:09.006, Speaker B: Yes.
00:10:09.108 - 00:10:40.790, Speaker A: So on the count of three, you're all going to get up. So the purpose of what you're going to do in your group is you're going to look at the problem statements that were left and you're going to improve them. The problem statements that we have, you just came up with yesterday. They're not good yet. Right. And there's so much more information that you, with what you know, your experiences, you can add to these issue areas and these problem statements. That's what we're going to work on over the next 40 minutes or so, because we know that we have built something that we as a group can improve on.
00:10:40.790 - 00:10:45.800, Speaker A: So everybody stand up. Find a seat in the issue area you'd like to work on.
00:10:49.530 - 00:11:02.640, Speaker B: Yes. Um, everybody welcome. Well.
00:11:05.010 - 00:11:06.000, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:11:15.370 - 00:11:17.926, Speaker A: Yeah, somebody really good morning.
00:11:17.948 - 00:11:28.600, Speaker E: How you doing? I work with the brand. Exactly. Coffee, car.
00:11:39.970 - 00:11:40.720, Speaker B: But.
00:12:00.690 - 00:12:05.140, Speaker E: You'Re more focused there. Like other stuff.
00:12:07.590 - 00:12:11.522, Speaker F: Gets cozy. Wonderful.
00:12:11.586 - 00:12:13.080, Speaker C: Anybody go find this.
00:12:13.930 - 00:12:21.270, Speaker B: Okay. There's some more chance in the background.
00:13:04.250 - 00:13:05.480, Speaker E: We are at the color.
00:13:20.370 - 00:13:51.720, Speaker B: Yeah. Each other like. Yeah, you were good. Let's, let's look at the.
00:13:57.450 - 00:13:58.600, Speaker E: Way trying to talk.
00:14:09.970 - 00:14:11.790, Speaker C: So problem stage.
00:14:15.810 - 00:14:27.310, Speaker B: People in poverty need access, funding and out existing credit. They need accessibility.
00:14:27.830 - 00:14:30.990, Speaker C: People in developing markets need more secure.
00:14:31.070 - 00:15:04.190, Speaker B: Ways of storing their money. Because the current way storing under. It's not that. And there was another one. Everyone needs unjaceable digital cash to guarantee their freedom. One is talking about credit like this is talking about how they store in an environment.
00:15:07.890 - 00:15:08.570, Speaker C: Authority.
00:15:08.650 - 00:15:16.320, Speaker B: This is like. So the difference and exactly what she talked about.
00:15:19.330 - 00:15:19.694, Speaker C: Yes.
00:15:19.732 - 00:16:22.360, Speaker B: Nobody wanted the other night it was share. So in terms of like what you want to around, but I would do. So why don't you.
00:16:27.130 - 00:16:28.520, Speaker D: So one of the.
00:16:30.730 - 00:17:12.326, Speaker B: Why don't you like um. Like I mentioned, one of the learnings was that something that drives like the secular economy we talked about yesterday might actually repeat that whole system.
00:17:12.428 - 00:17:15.314, Speaker C: And something that is good for protecting.
00:17:15.362 - 00:17:33.438, Speaker B: Your finances might actually have already the issue distribution. Right. So bitcoin for example, the much higher than we have. Neither one of them is an unchangeable problem.
00:17:33.524 - 00:17:34.254, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:34.452 - 00:17:56.850, Speaker B: But where do we want anybody have any thoughts about those problem statements or any, any story about anything that you can say how that relates to your background, at least in the sobriety.
00:17:58.230 - 00:17:59.330, Speaker E: For instance.
00:18:02.710 - 00:18:10.886, Speaker F: Several careers in order to get to work because they want to pretty much reject migrants, but they don't.
00:18:10.918 - 00:18:13.020, Speaker B: Like they just.
00:18:15.790 - 00:18:22.880, Speaker F: Allow her or him to work. So that is part of how the government.
00:18:23.890 - 00:18:25.950, Speaker B: How you can obtain.
00:18:28.370 - 00:18:29.726, Speaker E: Money or a.
00:18:29.748 - 00:18:38.030, Speaker B: Word that you can do with a kind of permission of the government where the migration.
00:18:41.410 - 00:18:43.086, Speaker F: People can actually find like.
00:18:43.108 - 00:18:58.422, Speaker B: Kids are being there too. I mean, it's not permission about what is gonna happen with the government that those migrants can stay in the country and they don't want.
00:18:58.556 - 00:18:59.400, Speaker F: They want.
00:19:02.090 - 00:19:10.310, Speaker B: So that's kind of like. That's a similar. That's a similar science.
00:19:35.050 - 00:19:50.838, Speaker F: We have a new unicorn. The second unicorn in Latin America is called Rafi. It's a delivery service. So we have now the problem in our borders with venezuelan migration.
00:19:50.934 - 00:19:51.434, Speaker A: Right?
00:19:51.552 - 00:20:16.290, Speaker F: So all migrants are coming and they're not ready, which is a big problem. And what happened with Rafi, these venezuelan migrants, they can join Rafi as a company, as an independent worker. So this company is actually giving them.
00:20:16.360 - 00:20:20.740, Speaker B: Access to get a formal job.
00:20:21.190 - 00:20:28.762, Speaker F: And this formal job is paid with token, but private token by Raffy.
00:20:28.926 - 00:20:29.640, Speaker B: So.
00:20:31.370 - 00:20:40.050, Speaker F: R a B E A. That is a great example of accessibility.
00:20:40.210 - 00:20:41.890, Speaker E: Through a private token.
00:20:42.050 - 00:20:44.966, Speaker F: But still there is some issues that.
00:20:44.988 - 00:20:45.720, Speaker E: We have.
00:20:47.610 - 00:20:50.638, Speaker F: The conditions of the world point.
00:20:50.804 - 00:21:10.690, Speaker B: Okay, so one thing was not solved. Okay, so you're also saying that untraceably.
00:21:11.750 - 00:21:12.500, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:21:15.530 - 00:21:16.760, Speaker F: They are all interested.
00:21:18.650 - 00:21:35.734, Speaker B: But it's good to have these examples here because right now it says everyone. But to make it more specific. Okay, let's look into funding without existing credit record.
00:21:35.852 - 00:21:44.640, Speaker E: Basically we write it. You can't even.
00:22:04.050 - 00:22:24.600, Speaker B: Travel. They. Yeah. Okay, you talking about who is that? One thing that came up yesterday too. Who is yesterday. But.
00:22:27.930 - 00:22:28.680, Speaker C: Once.
00:22:55.370 - 00:23:26.974, Speaker B: Kind of exchanging or you say good, then that's a solution. Right? Director will is working on that. So that was a thought even.
00:23:27.012 - 00:23:28.030, Speaker E: No one's nowhere.
00:23:33.750 - 00:23:35.620, Speaker B: Any other thoughts about.
00:23:37.830 - 00:23:46.900, Speaker F: The issue? Like we can like helping you.
00:23:49.050 - 00:23:53.080, Speaker E: When unison like try to do that is going to.
00:23:57.610 - 00:23:59.030, Speaker F: We have a private.
00:24:03.950 - 00:24:13.338, Speaker C: Okay, you're proposing that blockchain as you mentioned.
00:24:13.504 - 00:24:16.126, Speaker B: And if they're cooperating parties, potentially they.
00:24:16.148 - 00:24:18.830, Speaker D: Could actually change any other candidate leader.
00:24:19.730 - 00:24:58.380, Speaker B: But as long as you're aware of that then. But the transparency and of mountain tools. So it's something to think about. It cannot be. And then also small comments, you know.
00:25:02.190 - 00:25:03.520, Speaker D: Just kind of like.
00:25:07.570 - 00:26:09.040, Speaker B: Are projecting red providing or not like.
00:26:15.370 - 00:26:16.470, Speaker E: Where it risk.
00:26:19.370 - 00:26:20.680, Speaker F: So it seems.
00:26:26.570 - 00:26:27.640, Speaker B: Like. So now.
00:26:30.330 - 00:26:31.110, Speaker E: You'Re.
00:26:32.490 - 00:26:33.400, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:26:37.530 - 00:26:38.600, Speaker E: More than one.
00:26:42.690 - 00:26:43.054, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:43.092 - 00:28:31.520, Speaker B: So yeah, that's a good point. Something I was thinking of yesterday that we were talking about learning. Maybe we can look at that came up already. Like came out kind of like so early, but not. But the nurse. But they know that we can also think about that. So like altogether solar panels about.
00:28:31.520 - 00:30:24.320, Speaker B: Yeah. Understanding. But it was about. And understand protective actually value. There's like when you understand what their value, understand how they fit into. And then you can actually start catering. Catering micro traveled the world.
00:30:24.320 - 00:32:48.450, Speaker B: They don't rely, they don't value like ingredients. So yeah. Private entities publicly how do you in a way making a great case there's that long. Yeah. Aggregate but invisible and it's done Maryland people that would otherwise.
00:32:58.890 - 00:33:00.310, Speaker D: But I think.
00:33:00.460 - 00:33:20.894, Speaker B: Tension between the people like yeah, really great.
00:33:21.092 - 00:33:21.502, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:33:21.556 - 00:33:52.214, Speaker B: Like I already said like wonderful in our right now is visible so they can have and there are people want.
00:33:52.252 - 00:34:02.380, Speaker E: To not be seen anymore. Right. And I think those tie into the question of accessibility. People who ownership of their wealth are at risk want to not be there.
00:34:05.630 - 00:34:14.720, Speaker B: Yeah. So they want to.
00:34:17.490 - 00:34:18.240, Speaker C: Get.
00:34:22.290 - 00:34:40.280, Speaker B: Like um. Yeah.
00:34:43.370 - 00:34:44.120, Speaker D: Like.
00:34:49.050 - 00:34:49.800, Speaker E: Very.
00:34:55.130 - 00:35:06.430, Speaker B: Different type where I was like distribution.
00:35:19.010 - 00:35:19.760, Speaker E: So.
00:35:23.810 - 00:35:53.310, Speaker B: Yeah there is the creating mapping.
00:35:53.730 - 00:35:54.720, Speaker C: So basically.
00:35:59.330 - 00:36:41.066, Speaker B: The one creating is journey.
00:36:41.098 - 00:36:44.190, Speaker E: About things we're doing rabbit.
00:36:48.610 - 00:37:31.120, Speaker B: Government. I mean that's exactly where we basically about creating an alternative. So. And then looking there's around this. But they've never liked. Okay.
00:37:42.630 - 00:37:43.380, Speaker C: Anybody.
00:37:46.470 - 00:37:58.738, Speaker B: Yeah. Economic in terms of like. Okay. So I added the learning that people becoming participation.
00:37:58.834 - 00:37:59.094, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:59.132 - 00:38:03.650, Speaker B: And that zoomed in a little further.
00:38:03.810 - 00:38:06.294, Speaker C: Understanding one being like how do we.
00:38:06.332 - 00:39:11.120, Speaker B: Aggregate the value and also how can we guarantee that visibility is not the only thing that comes out that they have their own think about income. And in here part of the idea added redistribution of crypto supply can so it's not, this is not a solution but it's like because that could be on the mining side that could be area that is actually all about and.
