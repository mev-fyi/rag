00:00:14.650 - 00:00:58.270, Speaker A: The idea is for this to be a very interactive session. So I wanted to go through first just real quickly as an example, like what we're doing right now in Kenya and how we're trying to scale those kinds of solutions. And these are all just pictures that I got sent yesterday from people in the field working on these currencies there. And then we're going to play a bit of a game. This organization I started in 2010 and we started printing Vouchers in Kenya as a means of exchange for people. And we've been doing that progressively and progressively till now. We've got about 6000 small businesses that use networks.
00:00:58.270 - 00:01:56.020, Speaker A: I started this work about that was me 20 years ago at Stanford at the Accelerator. And I got super into agent based modeling and I got really unhappy with trying to look for pentacles. Turns out they don't exist. So I started doing agent based modeling. And the idea behind it was that if you could change one thing about economic systems, it was who gets to issue the money. And I was very connected with my parents, did a lot of aid work and someone told me one day that people creating currencies was just a normal thing, that it was being done all around the world. There was a book by Bernard Leotard that started popularizing these ideas and this was like back in 2007, there were some numbers like this, but no one really knew exactly how many of these little local currencies were existing around the world.
00:01:56.020 - 00:02:58.138, Speaker A: So I left physics and I started going into economics and I went and started studying these in the US and Europe. And there's a lot of actually super impressive systems. I mean, here in Japan, actually, a lot of the history of community currencies started in terms of them being popularized even by the state and national municipalities. So there's a really long history to this. And really you could say that people creating money was how well, I mean, creating local currencies was how all currencies started in the first place. And I started doing development work in Kenya, thinking that, well, all of these solutions that we saw all around the world in terms of groups getting together and creating their own endogenous local money, this would be a place where there's a lot of excess capacity and very, very little actual medium of exchange to make liquid that capacity in goods and services. So I moved into the slums.
00:02:58.138 - 00:04:06.300, Speaker A: This is Kibera. But I was in all sorts of slums across Kenya and we started getting together groups of businesses in those areas and basically just coming up with basic agreements and playing games like we're going to do. Today just as a demonstration and just coming up with what are the sort of rule sets we would need to make a functional medium of exchange in the vacuum of the Kenyan shilling? So when the Kenyan Shilling is doing very well, you don't need this stuff. But when it goes down, can we create this sort of counter cyclist mechanism so that these guys can still trade their goods and services and it's good to see when does that break down and how we've been trying to bypass those challenges. A lot of the original work I did in Kenya was based on the idea that there's a lot of aid flowing into Africa, like Tony mentioned, and all over the world, and that mostly it's ineffective. There's huge amounts of middlemen that are taking 80% of the actual money. Very little gets to actual people's hands.
00:04:06.300 - 00:04:52.280, Speaker A: And even when it does, it tends to just be a band aid. It's not really building local economies. And so we would work the idea of this was that you're connecting marketplaces together so that people can build more and more on top of that, and that the money doesn't just come into a community and run back out, that there's a time for it to sort of sink in. And so there's huge amounts of projects that we did where this example, people were collecting trash in this community, but all the businesses that were using these were the organizers of it. The people would be given out vouchers for sorting through trash. And we're trying to clean up all the plastic that is there's a lot of water in it and you get a lot of mosquitoes. So there's a huge amount of malaria in the area.
00:04:52.280 - 00:05:25.394, Speaker A: And so people would get these to collect trash. They could go and use them at the businesses, the businesses could circulate them. And then there was some collateral behind this in donor funds in that case. And that was all race until the donor funds were over. Right? And so that was like a one year project where we saw about five times the circulation and the usage of the money. So if we had paid people to just collect the trash, we would have gotten one fifth of the actual effect. So it was a nice test.
00:05:25.394 - 00:06:02.640, Speaker A: So that was the first one I did. This was the second one. And this one ended up getting really popular and we didn't back it with anything. We went into businesses just like I showed you before, and we just said, hey, we're going to create vouchers for everybody. So everyone starts with about $4 worth of vouchers, which is enough for about a meal. And they were just going to voluntarily trade them amongst themselves. And they had a system of kind of social guarantee where if Nick spends his and then stops accepting them back, he had four guaranteers that would go and beat him up.
00:06:02.640 - 00:06:07.140, Speaker A: Not really beat him up, but.
00:06:08.950 - 00:06:09.314, Speaker B: Figure.
00:06:09.352 - 00:06:40.650, Speaker A: Out what's wrong, help his business if there's a problem. So it was a nice community support mechanism and we had a huge bloom out of that. There was a lot of trade going on. We had grad students there that were helping do, like, tracking serial numbers at the time, and very low tech. We had stickers so people would know where to spend them. We had quite a few schools involved so kids could pay their school fees there's charcoal. This is like a mondazi.
00:06:40.650 - 00:07:24.634, Speaker A: And it was going so well that people started also trying to bribe the police with them. And then they took us to jail. Um, and so this is, you know, like, you know, as we start to talk about, like, what are the challenges of working in these areas is, well, this is so all of this stuff is very unregulated. You know, banks don't necessarily like it when other people print money. And so the Central Bank came after us and put us in jail and charged us with, well, a few things. Originally, it was terrorism. They claimed we were part of Al Shabaab and we were doing Professionist Plus.
00:07:24.634 - 00:08:05.000, Speaker A: And it was a time where there was a lot of that going on in Kenya also. So it was kind of bad timing, in a sense. Eventually, they charged us with forgery, and we went through about six months of court cases. And eventually the Attorney General, we did a big petition internationally. So, like, all those projects I was showing you before, there was a meetup in Japan just here a month ago, and every two years, there's a meetup of all these community currency practitioners and researchers. It's worth checking out. So, anyway, there was a big international petition, and the government was very embarrassed about the situation because it got to be a big news thing.
00:08:05.000 - 00:08:58.886, Speaker A: There was a comedy show that was created based on this as well in Kenya. So it was like all these people in these places where the government doesn't help them at all, they have no rights whatsoever, were making their own money, and it was circulating more and more useful to them than the Kenyan Shillings, which were just there once in a while. So it was filling the gap, in other words. And the fact that the government would come after us in this way was really ended up being very, very embarrassing to the government. The Attorney General came out and said, there's no law being broken here under Kenya Revenue Authority, like taxation or the Central Banking Act. And so that was like, we were given a clean slate. They also recommended that the Central Bank start to regulate these things now that we've gone blockchain and we're not printing so much anymore.
00:08:58.886 - 00:09:20.346, Speaker A: They do actually like us a bit more because they want to be a bit tech savvy. We'll see. So this is Relaunching after that court case. Like, this is one of the members of Parliament here coming out. And these are the people voting. This is his voting block, essentially. So there was a lot of huge hype.
00:09:20.346 - 00:09:58.826, Speaker A: And then pretty soon after, we launched another five currencies around Nairobi and some more in Mombasa. And this is a local chief. This is actually two different school headmasters. And always there was this idea of what's behind you. So back then, there was no hard guarantee, there was a lot of soft guarantees. It was essentially a social backing. Without the ability to litigate or anything like that, you would end up with a lot of often like traffic jams with these know, like, Kim here stops accepting them one day.
00:09:58.826 - 00:10:28.342, Speaker A: And we were all expecting him to accept them. Let's say he just moves or his business is shut down. You get a lot of this situation where people lose confidence quite quickly in them. So you end up with this kind of stop, go, stop, go. And most of these groups were about 100 to 200 businesses of that scale. And none of them really grew much bigger than that. And there was this general problem of how do they even know each other, that they're accepting it, and then how do they build cohesion around it.
00:10:28.342 - 00:10:52.510, Speaker A: And a lot of those groups are also very tribal. They speak a certain language and they really don't want to grow much bigger than that. And so the group size, group unit, in fact, even today, we still kind of use that unit. The trick has been coming up with protocols that connect them together. So all these groups creating their currencies. And we'll go into a little bit how that works. So like a 20 shilling note here.
00:10:52.510 - 00:11:27.782, Speaker A: What was really gratifying to me was that these notes were changing hands maybe about twice a day. And this is based on serial numbers way back then. We have actual data now to back that up. And that's about the cost of a meal. And that one piece of paper was facilitating about 700 meals, new meals in the community a year. And that just makes my hair stand up on it because it's huge. I mean, if you can imagine, one piece of paper enables 700 meals over a year.
00:11:27.782 - 00:11:50.814, Speaker A: One physical, little stupid piece of paper. It makes it ridiculous. What we're doing as humans, in a sense. Like, people are not eating because they're missing pieces of paper. It's weird, right? And here we're talking billions of people living in this basic lifestyle where money is sometimes there, sometimes not. And the ability to barter doesn't really exist. You have this kind of coincidence at once.
00:11:50.814 - 00:12:31.200, Speaker A: You can't really always be trading fish for water and things like that. It really doesn't work. And you end up with a lot of informal debt. And so one of the first things people do when they start using these is they clear a lot of those, like 20 shilling debts that they've had with their neighbor for five years. And they hated each other before. And we had an interesting study that showed that people were like 300 times more likely to start doing gifting with each other after starting these programs because they cleared a lot of that debt. We do a bit of branding when we go into the first community in an area, but then they start spreading it out from there.
00:12:31.200 - 00:12:54.290, Speaker A: This guy's selling water right here. What's his motivation? He's joining because he gets an initial amount of credit in the group and he's getting a lot more customers is the idea. So his turnover is going up and up and up. I mean, generally we see something like an increase of about 30% turnover for a business in the first few months of joining one of these programs.
00:12:55.050 - 00:13:03.238, Speaker B: Yeah, this might be a stupid question, but why is the national currency not there in the first place?
00:13:03.324 - 00:14:05.162, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of challenges around distribution. Obviously you could say there's enough money in the world. If we had $1 in the world and it was moving at the speed of light, that'd be enough, right? So we just have terribly inefficient markets where money is also just pooling and collecting in certain areas. In traditional economics you would say, well, if there's supply and demand in the community, well, then prices of commodities should go up and down. So whatever is remaining money should be enough. But prices are not elastic, right? And so you end up with this situation where there's literally just a swamp of money, maybe in a post harvest season, and then all of that money is spent on things like external stuff like sending your kid off to a boarding school or paying for petrol or gas in your car. And so it's like this analogy of having a bucket, right? Like you've got a bucket of water and there's just this leaking hole coming out the side.
00:14:05.162 - 00:14:55.834, Speaker A: So you throw money at that problem, but it's leaking up so quickly that there's nothing you can do to allow that money to stay there long enough to build industries and produce more employment. So a lot of these programs, like the cash transfer programs, you're dealing with giant holes in that bucket and you would hope that the money produces enough capacity in the community to start absorbing more and more of that money and using it in the community. But that's just generally not the case. There's a lot of different factors to that we can discuss more. So we go a lot through the entire supply chain. Mostly this is all to I mean, really, we go into a community, we do a lot of training with the chief and elders as we go in, but then it just becomes word of mouth at that point.
00:14:55.952 - 00:15:20.420, Speaker C: It will something also. I mean, these are communities that are living on less than like a dollar a day anyways. So the quantum of cash is more important in terms of that they may not actually have enough to live on. 80% of the world's poor is living like in these type of areas and it's actually growing. So they may have some scraps of cash around but it's the quantum cash that's really important.
00:15:25.270 - 00:16:17.762, Speaker A: What's super important in these systems is sub levels of social backing or local production, local goods and services. And so like schools, for instance, our baby schools or our primary schools, they're paying tuition fees, they're paying all sorts of fees. And so if those teachers can be getting part of their salary in these systems, the parents can be paying that. The teachers can use it for food in the community and circulate back to the community. So schools ended up being a good sink for the currency and a nice sort of like backer of last resort. Cooperative maze mills is another thing that was really super popular, where, like, this group was actually working with Red Cross years before this, and Red Cross came in and pumped a bunch of cash into the community because it was a food insecure area. And they actually trained them to do collective farming work and dig water pants together.
00:16:17.762 - 00:17:10.358, Speaker A: And so they actually spurred a lot of really actually good healthy community action but they were paying for it directly and when they stopped paying for it all the system just collapsed again. And so this was one of about 500 groups that Red Cross did this in and they saw what we were doing on the coast and they started their own system. And so there was a one group out of this massive groups of farmers that started doing this and they've grown to about 2000 users now. So they've gone to about 23 different villages now and so they're spreading super rapidly. In this case what they did was they said, well to replace that money of Red Cross we are basically going to create a voucher. We give it out essentially just one AirDrop to the whole community of the same $4. About that $4 can be used at this cooperative maze mill so they can bring their corn to grind it and so that's the service everyone knows they can always get for it.
00:17:10.358 - 00:18:01.158, Speaker A: They would then take any excess so they would pay off their operating costs in that so they have some workers there and then any excess operating cost goes back to pay for those activities that they were doing with Red Cross. So they created their own funding mechanism for doing that and so it keeps going around and then all the other business started accepting it. So as long as everyone knows there was actually some fundamental backing there that was enough to build that trust in that system. So I think we're going to go back to this idea of like your piece of paper or your token is a guarantee against what and just how important is that trust? Distribution shops. This is coconut oil. This is just an example. Marciana, she's 64.
00:18:01.158 - 00:18:32.970, Speaker A: She takes care of a family of seven. She lost her daughter. So she's the grandmother of those kids. And she makes Uji, which is like a porridge. And basically there's quite a few periods, like January, for instance, or maybe the first week of every month where the market generally crash and people don't have enough money to pay for her Uji. But now she has a whole market of people that can still come in with these. She can use them to pay for her kids school fees.
00:18:32.970 - 00:19:12.542, Speaker A: She can use them to buy her ingredients. So she has enough of a market now with this to stay so that her kids are less hungry and they're going to school more regularly. This is my co founder, Carolyn Delma. And she basically goes into these communities. She's generally one of the people who does the initial training with the elders and the chiefs and the women. And then she brings in a woman like that to go train the next community. And she's been amazingly effective at creating viral mechanisms where this person gets incentivized to go and build the next currency in the next community.
00:19:12.542 - 00:19:53.180, Speaker A: And that next community can actually pay this woman with their currency just to facilitate and set it up and do the training. So I wanted to do a game real quick here. So, yeah, so everyone's going to get two fives and two tens. And these are some of the currencies we use in Kenya. And if you have a pen, if you can write your contact on the back, like either telegram or Twitter handle, that would be good. So basically what you're doing here, you're minting your money. So imagine you were a business.
00:19:53.180 - 00:20:36.982, Speaker A: Think about, oh yeah, you've got to borrow Pins. So think about what you can offer. So in this simulation here, we're a market. I'm going to have you guys eventually all stand up. And the idea is, what could you sell to someone else in this room? And let's say it's maybe a secret, maybe it's advice, maybe, you know, some tips on pole dancing. Whatever it is, think about what you can offer. Think about what you want need to buy, and basically go ahead and try to buy and sell.
00:20:36.982 - 00:21:47.310, Speaker A: I'm just going to give you 5 minutes to just kind of experience this process in Kenya. Imagine you're a group of businesses selling different types of vegetables and shoes and imported items or services, right? Everybody's got them. And I'm just going to give you guys a few minutes and I'll ring a bell when you guys should stop trading. Everybody good? Everybody got some money? If you would write your name on it, write your name on the backs of them, you'll see, like there's an endorsement area on the back. Because again, these are claims against what right. If you think about this, if you're a business and you're missing vouchers for your business services, well, you should essentially be liable for these, right? So if you're buying advice off someone, well, they should be able to come back for whatever you have, or someone else should, right? Your name, contact somebody else is going to end up with those, and then they're going to come after you. We've got to clear our debts.
00:21:47.310 - 00:22:45.306, Speaker A: I'll give you guys just another minute to write your name from the back wood. Yeah, you don't you don't have to write what it is you're selling on there. You'll just tell the person. Okay. Raise your hand if you're ready. Waiting. You should get the material.
00:22:45.306 - 00:22:55.190, Speaker A: Yeah, but yeah.
00:22:55.380 - 00:22:56.120, Speaker D: Um.
00:23:07.310 - 00:23:08.182, Speaker B: Opening bell.
00:23:08.246 - 00:23:09.260, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:23:10.030 - 00:23:11.340, Speaker D: Are we all ready?
00:23:15.950 - 00:23:20.380, Speaker A: I think about your goal in the session right now is basically buy sell as much as you can.
00:23:23.950 - 00:23:25.610, Speaker B: Well, we had a workshop.
00:23:27.310 - 00:24:01.510, Speaker A: And feel free to, like, call out, like, what is it you're selling? You know, try to get some clients. Okay, so everyone started should have started with 30. And, you know, who did we trust to make sure that was true? We had some sort of central bank here that was issuing money to everybody. Okay, so everyone started with 30 of these vouchers. They were vouchers for your goods and services, right. And you were trading with each other, so ultimately they should be claims against you as a business. This is our demo for kind of what we do in Kenya.
00:24:01.510 - 00:24:24.594, Speaker A: In reality, in Kenya, it's a group of businesses. So what would be on the back of them would be the endorsement of that business network. And generally those are registered as, like, community based organizations in Kenya as a collective. So everyone started let's hear who thinks they are the richest in the room right now. Anybody? So count your money. Who's got more than 30? Raise your hand if you have more than 30.
00:24:24.632 - 00:24:24.834, Speaker B: Okay?
00:24:24.872 - 00:25:01.454, Speaker A: Who's got more than 40? More than 40? Who's got more than 50? Who's got more than 60? 70. How much you got? Kim, how much you got? 70. 70. Kim's up here, right? And I'm sure we've got quite a few people along the way. Does anyone have nuns? So Finney's down here, actually, sorry, we started there. So Finney's actually going to be negative in our chart. So here's our zero down here.
00:25:01.454 - 00:25:27.342, Speaker A: So what does that mean? And how are we sort of like duplicating regular economics with this, right? We've experienced some inequality now in the room, but these are claims. So, Kim, whose money do you have there? Do you have anybody in particular? I have fenny. Okay, there she is. So Kim's got some of Fenny's money, right? What are you offering? Fenny?
00:25:27.486 - 00:25:29.066, Speaker D: Bad legal vibes.
00:25:29.118 - 00:25:31.960, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. You never said it was bad.
00:25:33.370 - 00:26:43.050, Speaker A: So what happens in this case where she's gotten a credit by the community and nobody wants to go and buy back for her? Or maybe she's refused? So what happens in that situation? How do we clear these credits? And so this has been sort of one of the challenges of these systems for forever, where you create a closed system. People start circulating these, you create some sort of you agree on a credit line with people. And if there's no real collateral here, what's actually backing this? If it's just this social commitment, do we have a way to take Fenny to court? Probably not, right? Maybe we could go to her house and try to take some stuff out of it. But that's not the situation you want to be in, right? We don't want to have to go to Penny's house and start finding whatever value that she's sort of extracted from the community that she's defaulted on. And so this ends up being a huge challenge. We try to solve it with social mechanisms, but this can also cause a lot of traffic jams. Like, Kim's got a lot of money.
00:26:43.050 - 00:27:47.034, Speaker A: Well, what happens when Kim leaves town and maybe he takes some of that money so it's not moving anymore? Or we have a lot of people, few people way up here, and you end up with a lot of these. So, you know, it's nice that there's currency for these communities, but you see a lot of the same kind of problems. So what pops to your mind? Who's issuing these? How would multiple issues, issuers, even know about each other? How would they develop relative pricing? So if you imagine, like me as the central bank here, printing these out and issuing them fairly well, maybe you trust me to do that. But imagine you've got 16 or 30 of these issuers within a region. How would that work? And so what we're really trying to do in Kenya is like, I don't want to be the central bank, I don't want to be the trusted party for this. We want to create a system that's much more trustless. Right? And so we need systems of price discovery and guarantees and collateral.
00:27:47.034 - 00:28:45.730, Speaker A: How would you put on chain collateral? How would you put something that is a guarantee so that even if Fenny leaves the system and you're holding the bills so they're claims against Fenny, let's say, but they also be claims against something else. And so we'll talk a bit about actually the idea of staking dye into these systems, which is something that we've already started, you know, with paper, obviously, printing paper. I would never recommend it to anyone. It's not fun. Are they like national currency? There's a soft peg to the national currency, right? It's just a soft peg, in a sense, with these. There is no pool of money behind these, right? We're just calling them vouchers for Kenyan shillings. There's a big challenge.
00:28:45.730 - 00:29:17.802, Speaker A: People would recommend it. Usually they would use them as mixed pricing. Usually they would mix, as in, like, whatever you don't have in shillings, this is your top up. So that's the most common use case is as a top up. And then just on these bills, you'll see expirations as well. So every year we put a little stamp on there says it expires. And if you want to keep using your vouchers, you've got to come back to the group with as much as you got in the first place and then you just get the next stamp on your Vouchers.
00:29:17.802 - 00:30:11.280, Speaker A: If you have more than you started with, they'll only stamp those that they gave you. So it's sort of a credit clearing at the end of the year, right? We want everyone to kind of come back to level, so we try to put in those mechanisms. The idea is called Stamp script and it was popularized in Austria post World War. And there was a mayor that started issuing these and he would accept them as tax credit and for the local bus services. And it really took off and really circulated extremely fast. And it was outlawed by the government in a few months, or no, I think it circulated for like two years. And so the idea of fantasy Stamp script is just to basically tell people it needs to move, right? So it's sort of helping facilitate that credit clearing process.
00:30:11.280 - 00:30:50.038, Speaker A: If Kim stays with these for too long, they don't do them any good. So there's a lot of monetary design that can go into the currency themselves. And we can also put that sort of stuff on smart contract. So we've got 3.7 billion people are so not connected to the internet, so how are they going to use the blockchain? And we'll get into more of just the blockchain in general, but 2.5 billion of those at least live with signal. So there's a huge, huge population that has access to phones, right? And these are mostly, in our case, it's like little Nokia push button phones.
00:30:50.038 - 00:31:27.314, Speaker A: And so there's this thing called unstructured supplementary service data. It's an interactive menu based technology and it's supported on almost all mobile devices. And it looks a bit like this. You dial up what's called like a short code. And we have a server sitting there on the telecom that's waiting for the result of this menu driven system. So they can do I'll show you some examples. This isn't actually what the layout looks like, but they can do things like we have a marketplace, so they can access their wallets, look at their balances, they can do transactions, they can look at a directory.
00:31:27.314 - 00:32:07.000, Speaker A: They can actually enter in what it is they want to sell. We can have a little ranking system which I'll show you in a second because we're really limited in characters, so we can only show like the top four of each marketplace category. So you can say, I want to look for food and it'll show you that day. Who are the top users of businesses accepting? Yeah, it's a centralized stepping stone in a way. There's a lot of ideas where we want to have this completely decentralized. We want them to be able to manage their own keys. That just doesn't seem practical at least for the time being.
00:32:07.000 - 00:32:46.926, Speaker A: These are some examples of actual users. We've got Maasai guys who have little solar panels that they stick in their hair. Sometimes they're trading goats and things like so USSD coming in, we've got an AWS system. This is really simplistic and actually so Nick from Tempo is going to talk more about this after this. And then we're pushing out to a side chain. Right now we've been using these proof of authority based systems and XDI has die built into it. It's a hard spoon and it's uploaded to Ethereum so it's backed up on Ethereum.
00:32:46.926 - 00:33:30.474, Speaker A: So we have the security of Ethereum but the cost for this is almost nothing. It's like ten thousandths of a cent to do a transaction on that. So we can do as many as we want and they can clear in real time. So I basically send a signal to you. I say I'm going to trade with you and both parties get a receipt within about a second, maybe up to 5 seconds and the receipt is just an SMS coming back to both parties. So what we do today we are still in this process. So grassroots economics is going in on either behalf of a donor or when communities call us in we go in and do a training and we mint that token for them and we create an amount that's basically based on that population.
00:33:30.474 - 00:34:34.770, Speaker A: Right now this is some of the stuff we're trying to get away from where we want them to self generate their own tokens and manage them themselves. So we're building those systems so that they can do all that work themselves and our work is just going in and doing sensitization and training. So again we're doing this airdropping for new users and then we also get donors involved. Food security is one thing but there's quite a few other categories where we have donors that are already putting money into those communities and we're trying to get them to change how they put their money into the community based on some parameters of how the community is using that money. So it's giving donors a way to actually get parameters or impact measurements in those communities. So savings in loan groups and other key businesses like I showed you the schools, what's the backing? It's a guarantee against what? So there's still that there's a huge need for that social backing to be there and then all these community currencies are now exchangeable with each other as well. And so we'll go into what is those mechanisms.
00:34:34.770 - 00:35:13.694, Speaker A: We're also getting into the point where they're exchangeable to national currency. So the ability to put collateral, take national currency let's say from a donor or from the savings groups itself. They can put that, they basically can buy die with it. They can stake that die into a reserve and that gives these local currencies the ability to essentially cash out and in. And we have automated conversion between tokens. So each user right now, when they go into the system, they choose their community token. And whenever a foreign token comes into their wallet, it automatically converts into their own token.
00:35:13.694 - 00:35:53.020, Speaker A: And that actually creates price imbalances between the communities. And we'll go into that a little bit. And again, we're using POA as a side chain. Yeah. Okay, so we're not going to go too much into the math here, but the idea is that your price of your token is based on two things reserve. So what's actually behind it? So we're in the situation now where we're just starting to connect this to Dai. So if you've got Dai in reserve, and let's say I have $25,000 of Dai and I create a supply of $100,000.
00:35:53.020 - 00:36:30.534, Speaker A: So I've got 25% here. You can imagine, right? So my reserve ratio is 25% if I choose an F. So F is a target reserve ratio. So if I say F is one, when I create the smart contract, I say, okay, we have a standard on what we're going to allow for the reserve ratio to be. And so basically, let's look at it this way. So imagine here's this example where we've got a price of one to one with a reserve at a point. So here's what we want to do.
00:36:30.534 - 00:36:55.886, Speaker A: We want to be able to create currency. We love the idea of this sort of social backing. It's very nice, but it breaks down quite easily. So we want a way of putting actual collateral into the system. We don't have enough die to give everyone, right? And people just don't have enough money in general. So we need to be able to create more money. And it's sort of irresponsible to do that with just pure social backing.
00:36:55.886 - 00:37:54.822, Speaker A: It's really hard for a group, especially as those groups try to expand out. It ends up being something that may work with a dozen businesses well that know each other well, speak the same language, but as those start to scale and grow out, it breaks down really, really quickly. And so doing this for ten years with paper currencies groups of 100 to 200 businesses, that's about it. Scaling beyond that not so easy. So we've created dozens of these currencies all over Kenya. Now the question is, well, how do we bring them together? Is there a mechanism to allow them to trade with each other? But also, how do we allow them to put real collateral into those systems and leverage? So Red Cross again, is pumping money into these communities already, and generally that money just leaks right back right out. And can we have them instead? Put that money into these reserves is the idea.
00:37:54.822 - 00:38:22.182, Speaker A: So just looking at this graph again, so imagine you've got a total reserve for your so you're a token creator now in the community. You could be a group of businesses that come together that are doing savings. And you've got a reserve of Kenyan shillings. There's e money in Kenya. So we have an interface that goes directly from that same USSD menu to deposit into their own savings account. That is in dai. So this dai.
00:38:22.182 - 00:38:47.750, Speaker A: So here's your dai that's locked into this contract. And then we're going to mint four times that in tokens. So if we've got a 25% reserve ratio, we've got four times the leverage is the idea. So we've created a whole bunch of tokens here and we say that they're one to one with each other. In other words, every one of my tokens. So if I started with 25,000 die, now I have 100,000 die. That's what I'm saying, that they're one to one.
00:38:47.750 - 00:39:03.642, Speaker A: It's not die anymore. It's my die, right? It's my token. They name it themselves. So it's their credit, essentially. It's a credit against some reserve. So we've minted money here. And what's really exciting about this is we need something like $2.5
00:39:03.642 - 00:39:58.406, Speaker A: trillion in the next five years if we want to do any of these activities that the UN is specifying under the Sustainable Development Goals to deal with refugee issues. And that's also the same size as the World Bank's quoted credit gap. Like, there's not enough credit in the world anyways at all right now in terms of demand. So if communities have a means of creating their own credit and doing it safely with some actual collateral behind it, this could be the solution for that. So that's the idea in terms of scaling all this stuff and working with Red Cross, nick is basically designing those interfaces right now of how to on and off ramp money in and out of these systems. So I'm sure there's a lot of questions here. One is, what happens when there's less and less reserve in that system? So let's say people start pulling out that reserve.
00:39:58.406 - 00:40:35.426, Speaker A: Well, what happens is the price is going to drop down below. So if we said, okay, this is essentially one to one with shillings, call it a die shilling. So once it starts dropping below a shilling so I have a token now that is only let's say we're down here at like we get down to that far, .5. So people are starting to cash out. Okay, there's some mechanisms we can put in the smart contract that limit how fast they can cash out. That can be a choice of the community. So actually what we do in Kenya right now is that they can actually only cash out 10% of their balance, so of their supply.
00:40:35.426 - 00:41:22.454, Speaker A: If they want to cash this out into this, they only do 10% a week right now. And that's a choice with the community. So the idea is that's their reserve, they own it, they should feel as they're pulling that reserve out, their price is dropping and dropping. What does that mean? Well, it means there's an opportunity for the next community over here to buy into that community. So if I want to buy her tomatoes and I'm in another community and I see that my currency is now more valuable compared to hers, there's this sort of arbitrage opportunity. And if I go and buy from her with my tokens from my community, basically the reserve behind mine, actually, when she converts it to hers, which happens automatically, that reserve goes into her currency and it brings that price back up. So there's a price stability among the communities when that happens.
00:41:22.454 - 00:42:02.878, Speaker A: And there's also an opportunity for me to go in or for her to say, well, I can actually use my shilling now, or a donor could come in and say, I can use my dollar shilling, I have more purchasing power with it. Right? So for one shilling now, I'm going to get more tokens out. Does that make sense? So that drives it back up. And so we're depending on basically two things. We're depending on markets between communities in terms of that sort of market arbitrage. We're also depending on the market in and out of the Kenyan shown to stabilize those prices. This curve, the shape of this curve depends on that reserve ratio.
00:42:02.878 - 00:42:14.200, Speaker A: Okay? And so right now, we've actually been using 25% quite a bit here. And we've got twelve communities trading with each other and they've all been very stable with respect to each other.
00:42:19.390 - 00:42:25.094, Speaker B: How long has there been how long has it been stable?
00:42:25.222 - 00:42:53.890, Speaker A: We've been doing this for about a year and a half now. The biggest fluctuation I've seen was about like a 0.8 to a .2 or sorry, 1.2 in terms of price gap in that those tend to clear within about a month of each other. It's really interesting to look at those oscillatory effects. And there's also this sort of like concept of negative feedback.
00:42:53.890 - 00:43:28.254, Speaker A: The collateral is die, not either, right? Yes, that's the idea. Right now it's just pure cash, in fact. So I have a top level token. So instead of the Dai, we just have a temporary token that's not connected to anything. And then I've got a bank account and we're making that pay happen with the bank account. Right? So we take that bank account, put it into emoney, and we just send it back and forth right now. And that's not a fun process to do.
00:43:28.254 - 00:44:24.340, Speaker A: And so eventually a whole interface for how this thing works will be through the local E Money system. And then like, Nick is also working in a lot of areas where there is no E Money system. And so in that case, he's working with local vendors that sort of act as E Money. Maybe he can show I'll talk about it, maybe it's a good time to just show some slides. Yeah. Think about also if like the Fenny situation, like, imagine Fenny leaves the community or no one can get anything from her and let's say she was representing a whole token. Okay, so this is a village, people are using a currency, but now all of a sudden the main thing people were buying from it is gone.
00:44:24.340 - 00:45:25.410, Speaker A: Say the school breaks down or there's a huge drought or the water source for one of these communities is completely gone. Well, people still have a claim against that reserve now is the idea, right? So it's giving them some backing and they can move that to her community over here. So the price of Feni's token is going to collapse, right? Her token's value is going to go up. If there's anything this community can offer, let's say maybe not now, but next month when they rebuild or something like this, well, they can use that money back in her community. And so this idea of being okay with the idea that the value collapsing completely doesn't have to be a bad thing because it means that those people move their reserves somewhere else and I think tokens should be able to fail. I don't think that's a bad thing. And if there's a community of tokens of currencies, then that creates a market where things can be more stable.
00:45:27.770 - 00:45:38.422, Speaker E: Before you said that there was a need for a kind of social backing like the school, where people would be like the buyer of last resort for their respective communities.
00:45:38.486 - 00:45:39.100, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:39.550 - 00:45:46.150, Speaker E: Does having a reserve reduce the pressure on that main social backer?
00:45:46.230 - 00:46:39.002, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So there's like a buffer now. If school has accepted as much as they really want to at that point, then people always have the option of cashing out. And as they start cashing out, that does start dropping the price and it also gives an incentive for other people to start putting more money back into the system. With tokens in general, there needs to be something behind it, right? And even if that's like the savings of these groups, they're actually saving in these currencies as well. But they have a savings in the national currency, right, that goes into their collateral, but they actually demand savings also in the local currency and so that creates a demand as well. And these groups of women will loan it to each other as well and they charge interest that goes back into the group itself.
00:46:39.002 - 00:47:22.922, Speaker A: So it's not really extractive interest like you would have with banks. And so that also creates some pressure and demand. And we've had some municipalities accepting them for like there's a daily business fee for going to some of these marketplaces. And so if there's any demand for it at all, then as long as if that price starts to drop down, well, there's always a point at which it's worth it to buy back in because you need to pay for that thing, whatever it is. Churches have started using these a lot for Tidings. Mosques are using them for Zakat at the end of the year, during Ramadan, and they see it as like a but they don't charge interest on there. So different groups use them in totally different ways.
00:47:22.922 - 00:47:37.854, Speaker A: And I can't even tell you what half of those ways are. I mean, we've got a lot of grad students and researchers that come out into those communities. But, yeah, the idea of having backing is, I think, super important to me.
00:47:37.892 - 00:47:38.142, Speaker B: Why?
00:47:38.196 - 00:47:59.490, Speaker A: The community currency movement over the last, like, 30 years. It's been a very social movement, but it's also been very isolating. Generally, they don't connect to each other. They don't connect to national currency at all. And there's this sort of wall, like, we don't need your currency. There's a remote down there. All right? I think the TV just died.
00:48:01.990 - 00:48:09.526, Speaker B: What I can just go is I can just put my laptop in the middle of the room. If there's savings in the community, what's the average saving per community?
00:48:09.628 - 00:48:37.346, Speaker A: As far as the whole yeah. So they'll save up to something. Like a group is actually 25. Lemons. So even within one quote unquote community, you could have many, many of these groups. And generally, you have, like, maybe a dozen of these savings groups, and they are saving, like, one to $2 a week per person, and they get up to something like $200 in total. So generally, having a pool of $200, they start loaning that out in general.
00:48:37.346 - 00:49:13.706, Speaker A: So what we're doing is we're saying, well, hey, you guys can also start to leverage the savings that you have into more credits. Because as much as this whole savings thing has been amazing across Africa, like, these tabletop banks have actually done amazing work. Like Catholic Relief Services is one of these groups that have created a thing called silk, which is savings and internal lending cooperatives. And they do really amazing work. And they do it all with these three choir notebooks that they cut with, like, razor blades. They're really amazing. And I'm super impressed with what was.
00:49:13.728 - 00:49:14.586, Speaker B: The name of that?
00:49:14.688 - 00:49:43.880, Speaker A: Catholic catholic Relief Services has developed this thing called Silk, which is worth looking, and they have a training manual. And it's gone really viral because those groups go and train the next groups and they get paid by the next group to basically be the auditor of that group, the trusted party. And what we've been doing is just so they can use national currency, they can use Mpeza, and now they can also leverage. So we're just adding a tool to their tool set right now. And that's how we've been spreading as well.
00:49:46.330 - 00:50:00.950, Speaker E: Is this possible to supplement the programs that give directly does So if I was to donate rather than to give directly directly you would give it to the reserves of the community that can then leverage it as an internal credit unit.
00:50:01.030 - 00:50:25.730, Speaker A: That's totally the idea. And be able to use the data for your decision. Let's say Red Cross is seeing that there's a drought coming. That's the time now to start feeding that reserve, give it more value. And they could also look at metrics, like if you want to support education. And everyone's also got a wallet, so you could just give to them individually.
00:50:27.050 - 00:50:30.230, Speaker B: I really love that you read that one because it's like the end goal.
00:50:31.530 - 00:50:32.374, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:50:32.572 - 00:50:42.234, Speaker B: Awesome. Just so I can tailor this presentation. Who was here yesterday for my Oxfam talk? Okay, so not too many. Okay.
00:50:42.272 - 00:50:42.938, Speaker A: So I'm going to do a little.
00:50:42.944 - 00:51:15.634, Speaker B: Bit of overlap just to cover some of the stuff. Sorry. So my name's Nick and I'm the co founder of SEMPO. SEMPO is really focused on creating payments infrastructure and savings infrastructure to create financial inclusion in exactly some of the markets that Will is talking about. So one way of looking at us is that we're just about a payments rail, which is kind of cool in the first place. But what I really love about what we're doing is that it really dives deep into some token economics here. So it's a lot more than just a regular payment system.
00:51:15.634 - 00:51:55.326, Speaker B: It's about really setting in that framework in place to really set up entire new ways of making infrastructure, working in psycho from the ground up and reimagining a lot of that. And I think that this time we're living in right now is really exciting because it's really the first time that anyone was actually seriously able to doing these sorts of alternative financial systems inside community. So now people going nuts about it because of the nature of what decentralization frequency we can pass through creating new equity models. So this is vanuatu. I just got back from working in Vanuatu. It's a collection of 87 islands in.
00:51:55.348 - 00:51:56.686, Speaker A: The middle of the CIS Ocean.
00:51:56.718 - 00:52:38.266, Speaker B: They're some of the most isolated islands on the planet and also some of the most disaster prone. So we get volcanoes. This is Tana Volcano, which is just super cool. And I should show you a video of it. And they have typhoons and all those sort of things. So one of the nature of having these isolated islands is that banking infrastructure is basically non existent because it's just too expensive when you have these little small populations in the surface across islands to actually put bank branches on each island. So there's actually more people with a volcano on their landmass than there is with a bank on their landmass.
00:52:38.266 - 00:53:30.190, Speaker B: There's more people who are volcanoed than there are banks. You don't get money that you get lava. So this is like something makes that Will is facing and if you want to get cash to people, really, really challenging. And so what we do is because the magic of the Internet, we basically set up these entirely digital network and site communities where we have people payment cards or mobile phone based digital payments. And it allows people to spend things at local stores. And then we can set up payment links with the stores themselves because it's a lot easier to get cash to stores who tend to have a higher level of financial inclusion than it is to get money to sort of set up payments directly to individuals in terms of fiat on ramps and off ramps. So that's the space we're playing in on top of these sort of token economics that we'll have.
00:53:30.190 - 00:53:41.978, Speaker B: Talking about this is like a whole bunch of problems when you actually try and do this in practice though, because once again we're talking about some really remote and quite isolated communities.
00:53:42.154 - 00:53:46.290, Speaker A: Sorry, are these part of some margination?
00:53:46.370 - 00:53:52.918, Speaker B: Yeah. Better watch it. Better watch residence, better watching. Okay. It is easy if I have a.
00:53:52.924 - 00:54:03.180, Speaker A: Real presentation raising any of you ever heard of that country? I didn't know about it before.
00:54:08.270 - 00:54:09.980, Speaker B: I should just show where it is.
00:54:13.970 - 00:54:14.846, Speaker A: That's where it is.
00:54:14.868 - 00:54:22.910, Speaker B: It's like literally this little scattered set of islands. And this is what, this is what Pacific island communities look like. They're like highly sparse island.
00:54:25.030 - 00:54:25.780, Speaker A: Yes.
00:54:29.110 - 00:55:04.942, Speaker B: So the classic problem we face is this sort of internet penetration. Just to give you an idea of what the communities actually look like. These are the sort of places that these islands have. So there's not necessarily a cyanide penetration. What we've found is actually a really common failure mode is that there is going to be three or four gene networks, but these communities are sort of ryan on the fridges. I don't know if you guys have ever experienced like attached connection. What we find is really common in practice is that you ostensibly have internet, but it will be there for like 5 minutes and it'll be gone for 5 minutes.
00:55:04.942 - 00:55:59.870, Speaker B: It's not an all nothing thing. So you sit there and you send an SMS and then forget that you send an SMS and then 5 minutes later goes whoop in your pocket? And so this is kind of okay for a lot of things that are like synchronous or asynchronous sort of actions that we go through. Like trying to send an email is actually pretty okay when you have only questionable internet. But it really does break down for a lot of payment processes because payments are something that you don't really have the privilege of going away and saying hey, trust me, the money will come in 10 minutes. People need a guarantee on the spot because it's in person interaction. So we really need something that's really quite responsive. And so what we actually do, one of the things we've worked on inside communities is actually using contactless payment cards.
00:55:59.870 - 00:57:17.750, Speaker B: The reason we use these is we do a little bit we take a little bit of centralization to our process, but it allows us to basically store data and balance on side the cards in such a way that we can case transactions on the mobile phones themselves and then put through payments at a later stage. And so the main challenge here, as you might imagine, is just the risk of a double spend attack. Because if you're making a payment at one store and then you go to another store, and neither of those stores are connected to internet right at this very moment, and they're storing their transactions to make later, how can you be certain that the person hasn't actually just spent all of their money at the previous store? And now when you're accepting a payment for them, they've got no money left? The great thing about these cards is that they've got secure hardware on them. It's not full cryptographic hardware, but it's hard to tamper with because there's a chip inside a card. So what we actually do in order to prevent a double spend attraction on the local level, is that we record the balance on the card at any given time. And the balance consists of basically two items. Your balance consists of the amount of money that you've had loaded onto the card in total sub, minus the amount of money that you've had subtracted off the card in total.
00:57:17.750 - 00:58:05.190, Speaker B: So if you had $10, you spent five of it or three of it. Let's make it your remaining balance is seven. But of course, the big challenge of these sort of processes is that you don't want people to be able to basically reverse their card and roll back in time. So we record the balances. These two numbers, the first one that Matt voted on is verified using the signature that's basically the vendor will have a list of trusted testers. And so when the person goes and tops up their card at any point in time, a signature is loaded on attesting to that ballot. There can be any one of delegated organizations that actually sets the balance for those communities.
00:58:05.190 - 00:58:54.834, Speaker B: And then when they go and make the payment, we actually use a one way counter on the card that is incremented but can't be rolled back. So that means we can be pretty certain of what the balance is on these cards at any point in time. And it means that when you go to a store, the vendors know the cards aren't going to be out of date. So that's some of the things we're sort of playing in that sort of community. One of the biggest challenges we've actually found, or traditionally an issue with sort of setting up payment networks inside communities is regulatory capture, which is basically the process of existing incomers regulating any competitors out of the market facebook is really facing right now. So I'm gonna I think it's like super interesting. I think it's like something that isn't discussed enough is mpaza.
00:58:54.834 - 00:59:45.394, Speaker B: It's like this fascinating story of payment mechanisms. So who here has heard of mpaza? Okay, who here knows how Mpeza works? Kind of okay, so I'll go through it. Mpeza's origin story is one of my favorite origin stories out there. I don't know how much this is true versus something that was sort of manufactured after the fact, but I like it anyway, so I'm going to tell it to pretend it's true. So basically Mpadia just started off as this way of sharing anti mental credits on communities. And I don't think there was a particularly strong hypothesis around what this was necessarily supposed to be. But in Kenya the classic problem it's a Kenyan product the classic problem people used to face is that there's a high amount of sort of local remittances between communities.
00:59:45.394 - 01:00:54.318, Speaker B: So you'll have people in rural villages who send family members back to some of the large cities to actually earn money, earn a living wage and then send that money home. And the process of sending that money home, it was something of a chaotic process because there was no money transfer mechanisms. So you either had the choice of getting on an eight hour bus ride yourself to send that money back in your backpack, or you could go through some sort of delegated type process, like a wallet network, where you basically ask someone to get on the bus and give you trust that maybe, hopefully, they give the money to your family. And if they don't, that's unfortunate, isn't it? And so mpaser what happened is it started this way of sharing these SMS credits, but what people actually started to do is that you'd have these basically informal kiosks that popped up on both sides in the city and in the local communities. And someone realized that, say, Penny is in the city and I'm a worker in the city and you're in the village, and I'm trying to get money to you. I could transfer my SMS, or I might have $5. I might not even have a mobile phone.
01:00:54.318 - 01:01:40.886, Speaker B: And I go, hey Benny, can I buy $5 of SMS credits? Off she go, okay, I'm going to charge you $0.10 for that. And then she would send those $5 of SMS credits to a kiosk in the village, who would then take a small fee of those SMS credits and then provide cash to my family member on the swap. So basically this SMS credit transfer process was basically turned into a way of transferring money even though it wasn't designed to, and voterphone notice this and thought it was really, really cool and built some more infrastructure around it. And that basically resulted in this payment process that we have today. And it is subsequently ballooned just from a way of making informal businesses to a way of making payments. So now it's really, really common to see these sort of setups.
01:01:40.886 - 01:01:47.360, Speaker B: And I'm sorry the image is so blurry. We have kiosks and they have these numbers absolutely right.
01:01:47.730 - 01:01:52.160, Speaker A: So you can either send it to someone with their phone number or they can have a little agent number.
01:01:53.330 - 01:02:33.322, Speaker B: And so Kenya has a population of what, 50 million? 50 million. And it was an. Absolute flying success there. So 2014, more money was transferred in sub Saharan Africa than Europe and North America put together. And another counterpart of counterpart of counterparty competitor of Mpaza english is my first language. MTM was also doing very well in decide to launch us into Nigeria. But they didn't go through the process of basically courting the Reserve Bank over there.
01:02:33.322 - 01:03:24.860, Speaker B: And what happened in the Reserve Bank basically completely kicked them out of the community by charging them. They were finding them basically a million dollars a day. And this was a process of basically the incumbent banks, basically forcing these communities, these existing telecom providers, to play by their looks. And this is actually one of the most common causes of failure of any sort of financial system. Moving into a country is just being forced out by existing incumbents who have the ear of whatever the regulatory authority is there. And it's something we've had to be pretty careful about. When we went to Chibatawashu, cryptocurrency was actually banned outright, and the reason was because they'd had one of the sort of scams, I think it was one coin scam recently, and the Reserve Bank was just no.
01:03:24.860 - 01:03:34.206, Speaker B: And so one of the things we've just learned the hard way is that you just need to spend a ton of time before you even watch these things. Just like speaking to authorities and setting.
01:03:34.238 - 01:03:35.554, Speaker A: Expectations around what's going to happen.
01:03:35.592 - 01:03:44.274, Speaker B: Otherwise you lose your sort of space. Yeah.
01:03:44.312 - 01:03:44.674, Speaker A: So sorry.
01:03:44.712 - 01:04:14.322, Speaker B: This is one that I really like, but it's one that everyone yesterday has seen. So apologies for everyone. Yeah. So we built a lot of platform working in northern Lebanon on the border of Syria. This is a refugee camp we're walking out of this called the Camp of a Car in a Car province. This is a really, really it's a tinder box community. There's about 20,000 refugees for every 5000 locals.
01:04:14.322 - 01:05:17.860, Speaker B: So the population split is just completely reversed, which makes it really interesting. We built a lot of our Android app while working overham, and we went in this pin orfed system that we thought was really going to work really, really well. So you'd have your card, you touch it to the back of the phone. What we found when we got there was that there was an existing cash based payment process in place that was using Debit Mastercards that had been distributed for refugees. And what had happened was that refugees were actually writing fair pins on the back of their card, handing this across to recipients, handing this to the vendors who would check their cards and then make what's super fascinating about this, and this is something I didn't cover yesterday. I think it's like the interesting part about this is the reason this breaks down. The problem that actually arises here isn't one of security.
01:05:17.860 - 01:06:22.534, Speaker B: The communities we're working with, like the concept of what would happen if your card was stolen wasn't something that was super prevalent and super concerning to these communities. What actually caused the real breakdown that happened as a consequence of this was that the entire control over the payment flow actually swapped over from where you check how much they paid and then enter your Pin to being controlled entirely by the vendor. And what this meant was that vendors were basically able to enter any amount into the payment terminal and then confirm it before the person making the payment could even check the amount. So the Pin wasn't even a Pin so much as preventing security. The key function of the Pin in this case, and I think it's probably true in a lot of societies, is actually just to make sure that you have the processes forcing the recipient to be able to check the balance before they make their payment. So we actually spoke to, oh yeah, this one's cool. I'll jump to the solution in a SEC.
01:06:22.534 - 01:07:13.302, Speaker B: But I think this is a really fascinating example because we talked about our system being based on Arabic, Hebrews, but this is what actually Arabs look like. They're pretty much foreign. So if you're forced to like, imagine if you were someone who was literate or didn't understand the local dumbbell set. If you like us and you guys are trying to remember a Pin that looks like this, it just doesn't work. So some alternatives have been played with, but at the end of the day, what we actually did was we spoke to a lot of refugees and in Lebanon, mobile phone penetration amongst communities is smartphone penetration is actually close to 100%. And recipients all taught us the same thing. The language was very much focused around this problem.
01:07:13.302 - 01:08:02.918, Speaker B: I said that it wasn't that we want to have security because we don't feel safe about our Pins. It was we want to be able to check and confirm the payment before it goes through. The last thing we want is we're talking about low literacy people is very big number that says how much we're about to pay and then a tick or a cross to make that payment. So it's actually what we implemented. This is a lady who has actually had learning difficulties, so really struggled with regular literacy. She's scanning a QR code that's generated by the vendor in the store and then the payment would come up with a check or the cross and the payment would go through. One thing we learned about making in store payments in this process, and it comes back to that Internet connectivity thing, is that you really don't have the luxury of a lot of time when you're actually working to actually let the payment go through.
01:08:02.918 - 01:08:52.600, Speaker B: And this is something that really struggles when we're talking about decentralized finance. My best guess is around after about more than so we talk about like 10 seconds not being like ten or 15 seconds not being awkwardly gone to UN to wait for a payment. But if I was to stand here for like 15 seconds, it would probably be excruciatingly awkward for all of us. Yeah, 7 seconds and I'm done. So the point is that these payment processes seem to happen really quick. Even looking at something like POA and the confirmation time on that, it just doesn't work fast enough. And so this comes back to a lot more, this sort of optimistic settlement and why we have to do it that sort of speed, which is something that sort of got us through a lot of that process.
01:08:52.600 - 01:09:46.338, Speaker B: Yeah, this one's super interesting. So we talked about basically trying to make repayments to vendors. What we found is that most vendors don't actually have access to a bank account at all. So repaying a lot of the vendors became subsequently impossible as well. And so we actually basically set up these almost borderline shadow banking processes where we actually had some larger vendors in the community who had liquidity in their own rights that we could actually use to pay back smaller vendors. So this is Lloyd, she's one of the vendors who works with vendor One too. And she had a larger throughput of money inside her community and so was able to act as that buffer.
01:09:46.338 - 01:10:36.466, Speaker B: So smaller vendors would actually come and when they needed to cash out, they'd actually go to her, transfer their dai credits over to that vendor and then receive money back. One of the challenges around this is when we think of banks, we think of them as in the absence of total economic failure, as basically having cash on hand. Right. We don't think of a bank run being like a very real problem on a day to day basis. When you go to an ATM, you expect it to be pretty regular for them to have enough physical cash to pull out in the communities. When you start to use sort of a shadow banking process, liquidity becomes like this really constant challenge. And you hear stories of it is totally normal for these sort of micro vendors to actually just run out of money on a day to day basis.
01:10:36.466 - 01:11:19.958, Speaker B: So people have this expectation of trying to cash out and then maybe they'll be able to do it on that day or maybe not to. Maybe they won't be able to because the vendor just doesn't have any cash on them at that stage. And so one of the things we've had to battle with a lot is once you've actually started to use like a distributed network for payments, is actually ensuring that all the elements of the system actually have enough liquidity to do these cash outs. And this is something I think is really excited about starting about swapping to entirely digital processes that you can actually start. Liquidity becomes an issue. But you were talking about how like $10,000 thousand shillings folks basically were like impossible to get rid of.
01:11:20.044 - 01:11:47.760, Speaker A: Yeah, so $10. There's the highest denominated bill. And if you walk around with that in a typical village or slum, you're going to spend probably an hour maybe trying to break that into smaller, smaller bits. And usually it involves like, you would pay her for it, and she'd be like, Hold on a second. And then she'd just leave her shop. She would come back maybe 1020 minutes. You hope she comes back.
01:11:47.760 - 01:11:59.620, Speaker A: Actually, the worst thing is my tip to you, if you're a foreigner in Kenya, if you can carry around change, definitely do it, because you will get that bill back quite often.
01:12:00.870 - 01:12:05.146, Speaker B: So I think that's everything I got in terms of the challenges we're sort of faced.
01:12:05.278 - 01:12:06.760, Speaker A: Is there any questions?
01:12:11.130 - 01:13:23.230, Speaker E: I've actually worked on a project to try to implement Mpesa, actually, because after it was acquired by Vodafone, they started rolling communities. But it was in Eastern Europe, and it wasn't really that popular, mainly because well, at least so I heard in Kenya, it was popular because carrying large amounts of cash was also a security concern, while carrying large amounts of cash in Europe is. And one of the aspects is that people are just used to having physical cash for settlements. There are some countries in which the access to cash is very prevalent, but there's still additional benefits. For example, you have cash, but you can't pay your mortgage in cash, right? So they try to actually implement systems in which to try to facilitate digital payments, to increase access to credit and additional banking services. But kind of like, what's the relationship essentially, between certain communities and their ability and willingness to go the digital route versus.
01:13:25.730 - 01:14:13.280, Speaker B: So one of my favorite stories from the Pacific Islands is when an organization tries to implement mobile money in the Sultan Islands. And what we've found is there's something really critical about the physicality of things, because the physicality of things represents their existence in many ways. And this organization basically got the messaging around mobile money, like, just completely got it wrong. And what they found was that there's these stories of these people who would go to their local vendors who had the cash and could access these liquidity points and say, here's my endpaser account. I'd like to withdraw all my money. And so they withdraw all their life savings. They sit there, they count it all, and they go, okay, put it all back in, please.
01:14:13.280 - 01:14:24.754, Speaker B: And it's just because they wanted to be convinced that this physical cash actually existed. This is a classic example of that.
01:14:24.792 - 01:14:40.520, Speaker E: Breakdown, but at least they put it back in. That's a crazy thing, because the communities that I worked in, they didn't actually, because they experienced hyperinflation within their lifetime. So they would take it out and they would literally bury it.
01:14:43.770 - 01:15:19.250, Speaker B: Benoitu recently introduced Plastic Banknotes, and everyone said, the best thing about New Plastic Banknotes is you can bury them in the ground for long without them washing. That is the revolution in banknotes. But yeah, so I mean, these are like it really comes down to I think even Japan is this classic example. This is still very much like a catch based economy. And I would be loathe to talk about what single defining factor has set whether this thing is going to work or not. It's far too complex.
01:15:19.990 - 01:15:51.374, Speaker C: I think it also has to do with the telecom provider. Just like for example in Zimbabwe you have Echo net which has Echo cash does. You know, in Kenya, Safaricom is basically the government. It's huge, it's massive. And they control everything in so many ways. So it just depends in countries where the government is less influential than the businesses, I think that dynamic is really important.
01:15:51.492 - 01:16:32.380, Speaker B: I think the other thing is that this is like all digital financial literacy things and all banking, like trying to bring everyone on to being banked. It all comes back to what's the value proposition. Actually having money in a digital form is not a value proposition in its own right. It doesn't just because something's now ones and zeros instead of digital doesn't make it better. And the number one reason that Kenya worked is because it was solving this problem of geographic boundaries. People hated the process of taking money from their local, getting money back to their local. And this is something we've found in Pacific as well.
01:16:32.380 - 01:17:27.100, Speaker B: There's about three things we've noticed determines equals payments. Like how HR provides. Number three is cost. Number two is like trust. How much do you know? Do family members recommend this payment provider versus this one? The number one thing that actually determines like choice of payment provider is locality. People just very good reason cannot be belted to drive 4 hours to their back, right? So if you're in a community and if you're in these concentrated European communities where you've got an ATM round the corner or there's geographically everything's quite concentrated, then this motivation of oh, I can get cash out right now is suddenly a lot stronger. Or the need for finding a digital process just isn't there as much anymore because you don't need to worry about how to move the money.
01:17:27.100 - 01:18:01.910, Speaker B: Actually I live in Germany. Recently I saw news reporter about rural Germany. The folks have actually a car with an ATM driving around because they had to close down these ATMs. They're actually too costly to operate. And that's in a country which is also very cash driven. So maybe this is not even the merging economy's unique problem. I wanted to ask though about the privacy concerns of all this.
01:18:01.910 - 01:18:56.454, Speaker B: Is that just kind of a first world problem and do you have to give it up in these situations, especially at Facer, right the moment that it turns into an actual payment facilitator, that means that the cell phone companies knows every single transaction like you did. And that's a pretty risky pool of information right there. Yeah, this is something that we're still working because we can do an anonymous between an individual and their Dai account. But the reality is the dye account is a full network, right? You can see every single transaction that's gone into them because we're not missing the money or anything like that. It's something that I think is like unresolved complicated for us, is like how you ensure that this is as private as possible and how you reach those balances. One of the things we've found is.
01:18:56.492 - 01:18:58.746, Speaker A: That one of the big selling points.
01:18:58.768 - 01:19:57.240, Speaker B: That allows us to get around this regulatory challenge is that reserve banks are just, especially in the pacific island, just totally terrified of being blacklisted by international government bodies or inappropriate money. Was actually on the EU blacklist until like, a year ago because they were just too flippant with the way they were treating regulation. It was too easy for people to borrow the money and the blockchain makes this a lot easier. So it's like, how do you match like, here's something, versus what is good tools to use? Exactly. I just want a supplement question to that. So part of that though, is like, you were talking of digital literacy, privacy, literacy. Is there any literacy or is it even relevant to be relevant? So this is like super interesting and this is actually from the humanitarian space.
01:19:57.240 - 01:20:32.550, Speaker B: There's been a tense to basically, like, obviously these office not worrying about it, not worried about it, but they absolutely understand the consequences of this. And one of the reasons they like the cards is the beautiful thing about a contactless payment card or something like this is the only thing that is used to prove that it's yours is the physical possession of it. It can be that simple. Which means that you don't have to have any other account information to prove that it's yours. Right? If you have it, it's yours. That's how our wallets work, right? I don't need to have my name on a wallet with my money in it to walk into a store paying people for it. People really like this.
01:20:32.550 - 01:21:18.022, Speaker B: And there's been a lot of cases in communities where some sort of biometric esque process has been used. So at the very least, like taking a photo of someone and people find it really, really disturbing to see. Like when you go and make a payment to go, hang on, you have my face attached to this payment account. And some NGOs have tried to basically say that people don't care about this because the Usability is so much nicer. In the classic example, UNHCR uses biometrics to authenticate all of their sort of NGO level. Going into a store, you wanting to get your food, we'll scan your virus and we'll give you your food. And they said it's okay because the Usability is all higher.
01:21:18.022 - 01:22:02.030, Speaker B: Which is absolutely right. If you don't need to remember opinions, ID, you buy your virus, it's great. But communities, absolutely they hate this because the rising refugees, they're totally worried about the data being handed across to the Myanmar government that have basically been oppressed using this data. And the thing is that they don't really have a choice. There's this concept of consent and then there's like non coercive consent. So if you're a person that has no other good alternative to how you're going to get your money, get your foods and vegetables, and people are like, well, you can either have your iris scanned or you can go and starve and die. That's not really consent.
01:22:02.030 - 01:22:27.014, Speaker B: Right? That's just coercing someone into having their iris scanned. And it's something that's just put under the rug and said, oh, can you okay with this? Then I'll just don't worry about this. And it's absolutely not true. So it's something that's like, I think, yeah, a huge bobby, you get this ask, but with cash you can easily.
01:22:27.062 - 01:22:29.494, Speaker C: Divide it so you don't have one point of failure.
01:22:29.542 - 01:23:06.214, Speaker B: So you can leave half your cash with your family and then go and go shopping, but with the card, you take it with you and if something happens to the card, then all your money is gone. Basically, yes. So we actually where possible, so when we've used these in the past, we've used them for cash aid programs. So what I mean is that it's money on, say, a weekly basis. No one has high value on these cards at any point. We follow collectively, we follow the exact same process that you would have if you were to have a mobile account, which is the card isn't tied to one account and then ideally, you have a secondary account. That is not directly tied to the card.
01:23:06.214 - 01:23:17.290, Speaker B: And you have some highly authenticated way that is less user friendly of shifting money between the two where possible. But that once again requires some thresholds of literacy in terms of how you're convenient.
01:23:18.030 - 01:23:19.306, Speaker A: I think, though, you have to put.
01:23:19.328 - 01:23:50.166, Speaker C: Some context around why you guys did the card. Because it was around emergency relief. Right. It wasn't so much that it was meant to be able to circulate within the community, it was tied to this kind of like volcano erupts. How do we get money quickly into the ground without having to spend time registering everybody active apparel? Right? And I think that if it's something where they want to use as a community currency to circulate it, then you probably have a different system that you might think of or a different process.
01:23:50.348 - 01:24:19.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, fundamentally, cards aren't great for community currencies like Will's talking about, because a card doesn't really what you want in community currency is for everyone to be able to act as basically both a consumer and for a buyer and a seller because you accept community currency in exchange for a good service and you go and purchase a different booking service for someone else. And a card is an eight. Like it's just a one way. So it really doesn't work in all context.
01:24:23.750 - 01:24:45.206, Speaker E: Sorry to harp back on the privacy issue as well, but for cash donation projects, you do have to kind of identify the individual, not necessarily through biometrics, but it's definitely part of it. There's a whole registration process, so you do have to kind of create a digital identity to tie to the Ethereum account.
01:24:45.388 - 01:24:47.560, Speaker B: Okay, let's play this game. This one's good.
01:24:48.810 - 01:25:24.180, Speaker E: The real question I had after this is so you have a personally identifying information, and then the second part is that who runs the nodes of the side chains? Because you kind of manage the data. And if you have the ability to de anonymize every account and anyone who has access to that internal side chain has basically everyone's entire financial history. I was wondering where does that fit? Because it's that balance of decentralization, but if you actually put it on mainnet, it's like broadcasting your financial history on Twitter right now.
01:25:26.070 - 01:26:04.682, Speaker B: Yes. Okay, I'm going to answer the first one first. Okay, well, I hope there's actually not really a question there, but we had real trouble actually doing like, KYC on each individual. And the most common reason we found about a while actually, was that people never spelled their names the same on. It was just ridiculous. You couldn't actually get enough documentation for each individual to actually cross check them enough to actually give them a full KYC check. Even people's dates of birth differ by days, months, or even years between birth certificate and driver's losses.
01:26:04.682 - 01:26:38.940, Speaker B: This isn't like stuff nefarious plot by people to conceal identity from the government. It's just like the nature of document keeping in these communities. Right? And it means that these sort of processes of direct cash out just don't really work. So what we actually do is we play a little game with the regulatory system and we actually create two A. We use die, use the die as like the store of value inside the entire system. But we actually wrap that in a secondary token. And secondary token includes a whitelist on it.
01:26:38.940 - 01:27:35.790, Speaker B: When you have a secondary token, you can only convert that back into dai, which is a fully very liquid token if you're on that whitelist. And so that whitelist is exclusively reserved for people who have KYC documentation. If you're not on the whitelist, you can still trade it with vendors on a day to day basis and we do KYC checks on the vendors, but then you can't cash it out into money. You just don't know who you are. And what I really like this is it's basically taking one token and making two things to two different people depending on their level of verification. But it means fundamentally, as a core, it means that we can safely give these tokens to people and we can have literally no idea who they are, but because we know they can only spend it at these vendors who I know are selling fruits and vegetables or clothing or something like that, not anti aircraft weapons. I don't know where you're going to buy an aircraft.
01:27:35.790 - 01:27:47.970, Speaker B: It means that we avoid a lot of those debates around, like, whether this person's KYC or not, because now it's an e voucher rather than an actual piece of fiat currency or cryptocurrency.
01:27:48.950 - 01:27:52.786, Speaker E: So this news story might actually have.
01:27:52.808 - 01:27:54.226, Speaker A: Been about your work, but there was.
01:27:54.248 - 01:28:09.894, Speaker E: Like a disaster, natural disaster, some kind of hurricane, and then all of a sudden there was a massive community need so that they decided to AirDrop actual payments directly to a community that had this type of program implemented.
01:28:09.942 - 01:28:10.586, Speaker A: Right.
01:28:10.768 - 01:28:27.120, Speaker E: So is that possible only through KYC people, or would you have systems in which you kind of like, okay, we didn't get to everyone, but we have a trust system that says we have trusted parties that are able to kind of do it for us.
01:28:28.290 - 01:28:46.420, Speaker B: What we do is you AirDrop the tokens to everyone. The tokens, not the actual cryptocurrency, and then you do your KYC on the vendors. Okay, this is going to give us coverage. We know that you can buy 90% of your things through verified vendors. So now we sort of have that coverage. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. Okay.
01:28:47.190 - 01:29:28.334, Speaker A: In Kenya, we use the telecom as our sort of proxy KYC. So if we know their phone number, they already went through a KYC process to get that line. And so you can identify who the person is by that phone number. And then we store all that information, though, off chain. And then the transactions though, right now are on a public blockchain. So if you were to go in and try to find out the wallet ID of that user by going through the community and doing transactions, technically could, but you kind of have to be there in the community. So, I mean, there is a security level where there is sort of like coinbase of wallet management system in place, right, that it has that identity.
01:29:28.334 - 01:29:30.850, Speaker A: But then we're still using a public ledger right now.
01:29:31.000 - 01:29:39.618, Speaker B: Yeah. So we don't have a good answer to your second question regarding who's running the node. Yeah. Because we're on POA, which is a public side chain.
01:29:39.714 - 01:29:41.922, Speaker E: Oh, you're actually doing it on the XDI chain.
01:29:41.986 - 01:29:42.358, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:29:42.444 - 01:29:44.902, Speaker B: Because XDI helps avert timing issues and cost issues.
01:29:44.956 - 01:29:47.270, Speaker A: Got it. I thought you were running your own implementation.
01:29:48.330 - 01:29:49.550, Speaker B: Because they're credential.
01:29:49.730 - 01:29:54.090, Speaker E: Yeah, it's the same infrastructure and they're way below capacity, so it makes sense.
01:29:54.160 - 01:30:00.150, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'll talk about the quantifiable images of blockchain. Let me ask the chips.
01:30:00.310 - 01:30:19.220, Speaker A: So what's kind of the flow if there's a disaster? I imagine that you got to get everybody onboarded, right? You've got to get the merchants onboarded, the users onboarded. So walk through just kind of the typical flow, I guess, is it you work with the nonprofits on the ground and they're the ones that are kind of onboarding everybody, or it's the flow a little bit.
01:30:22.070 - 01:31:21.326, Speaker B: You basically got it not for profits onboard vendors and recipients. I mean, simplest hypothesis around like how we want to operate as a company is that these sort of cash transfer programs are actually a really great the biggest problem with the reason we haven't seen any cryptocurrency spend processes actually come up in practicing countries, I think is one, because of regulation, what Liberty is experiencing right now. And two, it's this cold start network problem, right. Even if I had crypto yen right now, I can't walk into a lawsuit and go, hey, I'd like to buy something with my crypto yen. They're going to be like, who are you? And so cache programs are actually this really awesome way to kick start these vendor networks inside communities. Because what we've found is that if you tell vendors we'd like to get you onto this sub esoteric cash program sorry, some payments. No, it's a lot of effort.
01:31:21.326 - 01:31:49.520, Speaker B: If you tell them there's like a whole bunch of money, you have to be injected into this committee and the people who make payments really want to get the profit. There's something a lot more willing because now it's just a financial decision. And so we work with the NGOs to basically set up those networks. The NGOs do a lot of that work of actually just selecting recipients. We don't have a stronger we're payment, not a beneficiary selection. And then the vendors is like an economic, just regular sales process. So that happens pretty quickly.
01:31:51.810 - 01:32:21.814, Speaker C: So the Red Cross will have hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the country. And I'll give you an example. Like with Malawi when they asked them, there was a flood. Sometimes we can't get the money in the country quick enough. We can drive the trucks from South Africa full of cash across the border and then dumping them in a village. And actually we didn't AirDrop before, you don't know who's getting cash or strapping it to people's. So like we have to put in the context of how we do cash delivery, cash assistance.
01:32:21.814 - 01:32:40.574, Speaker C: Today, not everybody gets registered and you don't know who actually is getting cash because you have to drop it in a zone which can be totally devastating. And so even getting this far is pretty remarkable. And I think the nice thing about Nick's project is that they've cut down.
01:32:40.612 - 01:32:42.062, Speaker B: The registration process really quickly.
01:32:42.116 - 01:32:51.506, Speaker C: But you're predefining who these people are you getting them in the system. That's also where the community currency. Because then you start to build into this network like a mesh where people.
01:32:51.528 - 01:32:52.958, Speaker A: Are already pre registered.
01:32:53.134 - 01:33:33.278, Speaker C: And then I think a really important thing around Airdropping is that if there are droughts or issues, since they're already on the network, you can start issuing. Tokens. I mean that's the one thing with the community earning is that you can actually provide the leverage and as the peril gets more and more proof positive, you can increase the number of tokens. But if it is like a false positive, you can extract the token burn off. Because the problem we have too is we give cash to people, once they have cash it's gone, whereas it's token based or evaluator based, we can just extract it and then back to zero where we were. So it's still really archaic in how we distribute cash. It's getting better, but not in a.
01:33:33.284 - 01:33:42.530, Speaker A: Lot of areas with the phones getting pendant. There's the ability to do like self wallet creation, right? So you just dial the short code. You've never been on the system before.
01:33:42.600 - 01:33:44.834, Speaker B: You create a wallet instantly to use.
01:33:44.872 - 01:34:06.650, Speaker A: Within the network and there's a viral growth of it. We go in and do implementation work as well. But once people have those wallets there's also information about them. Who are you going to AirDrop to? There's already that network there and people can self register. That speeds things up dramatically.
01:34:08.190 - 01:34:35.890, Speaker B: This is Christian back. Yeah, I was wondering if this is enabling system where people receiving money they can start to transact in ways that they weren't able to receive money. So instead of donating money for a community could be possible to invest money in your community. Adam, you want to jump to mean you're better to talk about basically community currency.
01:34:37.590 - 01:35:34.534, Speaker A: So this is the whole idea of know this idea of having collateral behind these systems is to basically say well, can we invest into the growth of that economy? So if you remember this little bonding curve that we were using, the idea is that if here's my price and here's my reserve and here we're at a price of one to one with a reserve. So if I'm an investor into that economy, well, the more demand on that there is the better. So as that economy grows, if they're exporting, those prices are going to go up and I can extract that off. If you're an impact investor you could donate that profit back into the community and even using this potentially as a tool for remittances. So that's at least on our side. That's how we're thinking about this as sort of an investment opportunity to bring in private equity. Red Cross doesn't have enough money again to do all these things.
01:35:34.534 - 01:35:55.280, Speaker A: So bringing in private equity to invest into these reserves. So it's similar to investing into the collateral of a microfinance for instance, right? Like they need seed capital and so if there's a way to inject seed capital into these currencies there's the potential to really grow these economies much more.
01:35:56.610 - 01:36:19.986, Speaker B: One of my favorite things that sort of has come out of these digital payment spaces in these emerging economies is the concept of micro payments for daily needs. And so there's this really innovative program. I think it's in Canyon where this organization has come in and basically been selling efficient hot water heaters to communities.
01:36:20.018 - 01:36:21.350, Speaker A: Or efficient solar panels.
01:36:23.930 - 01:37:11.400, Speaker B: And no individual can afford to make the pacer for this outright on the spot because it's quite expensive. But it's something that's going to be a net return for that family in the long run a lot better than the existing system they have in place. And so what they do is to buy it, you hook it up to your end pays or account and it just takes out a tiny payment each week or month over the space of like a year or so. And this would be something that would just logistically be impossible to collect these 400,000 people on it. There's no way it make financial sense to collect a shilling at a time around these communities on a monthly basis. And so by just having it hooked up to this digital payment system, it actually is now diesel in a way it wouldn't be. And I think it's fascinating, something was just a lot of places to do a process.
01:37:13.210 - 01:37:19.720, Speaker A: And copa is to loans as a mobile lending system and they do solar panels and all sorts of stuff like that. It's really cool.
01:37:20.410 - 01:38:12.478, Speaker C: One thing so to the point about this investment side, just to add a little bit more color to it, the worldwide humanitarian budget is about $29 billion a year and it's only up 1% over last year. But the funding gap is over 30 something billion. But when you look at kind of funding flows, you have remittance around $550,000,000,000 a year, just remittance. And foreign direct investment is about the same. About between those two, it's about a trillion dollars. So from remittance and foreign direct investment and then you have private equity funding which goes which is like kind of lumpy that goes 300 billion a year. And so the point about getting tapping into those markets to be able to play in that kind of net with such humanitarian and development assistance opens up this kind of floodgate to financing.
01:38:12.478 - 01:38:30.000, Speaker C: And that's what these systems allow for. They allow these rails to get into these communities and build adjacency value, which is if you invest in one community, it helps the other network. It has like this network effect. So as an investor you can invest in one or two of these communities and see the uplift happen around and then get your cash out.
01:38:33.430 - 01:39:20.560, Speaker B: I bring this point because in Brazil we had social point of San Palo's social point that working very like this community that uses that social point developed so much that it was much more efficient than government problems, that acquired money by taxes invested on health, infrastructure and everything else so could tap a huge amount of investment. And we are speaking about government footage being better applied for social impact on those communities. And you started to mention on the bonding codes for that. Do you have any models for that or even prototypes of this working?
01:39:21.090 - 01:39:53.210, Speaker A: I've got some agent based models that you can find online. They're on GitHub as well, so you can look at that. And then there's a lot of modeling around bonding curves. Right now, coming out. Block Science is doing quite a bit of that work as well, which is very cool. And the body curve we're using has kind of we basically forked a version of what was originally the Bancorp protocol, and it's got a very simple set of equations on it, but it's been pretty battle tested. I think they've put $2 billion through those systems.
01:39:53.630 - 01:39:57.642, Speaker B: So far, it's a Roberto X five.
01:39:57.696 - 01:40:01.100, Speaker A: But, yeah, just connect with me and I can send you that stuff.
01:40:02.510 - 01:40:03.820, Speaker B: Awesome. Two questions.
01:40:07.330 - 01:40:27.380, Speaker A: I'll go first. So if we wanted to donate, get involved, what nonprofits? Is it Red Cross? Is Red Cross doing stuff here? What are ways in which it sounds like you're, like, a tech startup and I don't know, are you a nonprofit? Yeah, but what are ways in which we can participate in these things?
01:40:27.990 - 01:41:19.926, Speaker C: So I can see one thing that all of us are working on a project called Community Inclusion Currency that we are building this global open source platform to allow any organization to do this type of work. And the Danish Red Cross, which is where I'm from, we brought together the Red Cross network, along with Accenture and a few other groups to build this platform out. And we're looking at like seven or eight different countries today. So you can either go through Red Cross, you can go through one of these guys here, or put it in dye directly, give it to Dyer. I mean, there's lots of rails to get in there, but to really move the market, it has to be something significant inside in some ways, but it also doesn't have to be active. It could be, what, $10,000 to see a coin or 5000. So it just depends on the quantum of cash.
01:41:20.028 - 01:41:28.326, Speaker A: What's the project called? Community inclusion currency. Is there a website? We're working on it.
01:41:28.348 - 01:41:28.582, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:41:28.636 - 01:42:03.700, Speaker A: Cool. On the terms of community currencies, if you go to grassroots economics or look up grassroots economics, you'll find what we've been doing for the last ten years or so. And this is sort of scaling that up. And our organization is really trying to just do all the awareness and create MOOCs and do the documentation and go and create the trainers of trainers. Nick's organization. Right now, they've just open sourced their whole platform. So, like, all the stuff of bringing in USSD and all these payment rails is what he's working a lot on.
01:42:03.700 - 01:42:06.338, Speaker A: They're looking for believe.
01:42:06.424 - 01:42:07.060, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:42:08.790 - 01:42:20.114, Speaker A: I think that's really exciting because they're basically saying, here's an open source platform that we're building along with Red Cross and other partners, and they want to be the cheapest Rails in and out of that system, right? So they're doing the e money licensing.
01:42:20.162 - 01:42:20.706, Speaker B: And all that stuff.
01:42:20.748 - 01:43:08.650, Speaker A: So I think it's a great investment on that side. What we really want is the ability like something like Kiva, where you can just or you can say, look, here's $200 to see the reserve of this women's group, for instance. And those types of things like quadratic funding, all these kind of cool funding mechanisms can fit really perfectly into just saying we're going to push some money into these reserves. And that's exactly what Red Cross is doing as well. Like, how do we parameterize how we give cash out to communities and then look at those impacts? We have a website called WW Sarafu CZ, which is sort of a temporary dashboard for all the data. So you can look at I'll just write it up here. Hopefully it's up now, but you can look at just some of those kind of like impact measurements.
01:43:08.650 - 01:44:00.714, Speaker A: This is just the last year of we've got about like 70,000 transactions on there and we've anonymized. So you don't know who they are, but you can look at the wallet IDs, right? And so you can actually download that entire database of every single transaction. You know the gender of both parties, you know the products of both parties, you know what they're buying. It's a huge data set. This is among about I think we're at 5600 users right now, and they've done about 120K USD of transactions just in the last few months. And so the systems are starting to churn out a huge amount of information. And that information all relates to things like food security, education, what types of foods are they buying, nutrition, all that kind of stuff.
01:44:00.714 - 01:45:05.840, Speaker A: So picking out sustainable development goals and being able to say these transactions relate to these washout comes, for instance, for water and sanitation. There's a huge amount of work that needs to be done in terms of also customizing localizing the systems. Once this platform is really rolling, and ideally even by end November, we'll have things are working, but it's like sticks and bubble gum kind know stage at this point. And once that's up there, there's a huge need for customization, for data analysis, for prediction, for marketplaces. So bringing this to Bogota in Colombia, you would probably want a GPS app that's going to tell you where to go buy or how to use your currencies and marketplaces, all kinds of stuff like that. So there's a lot of layers that need to be built up and localized completely. So hopefully that's App Store esque concept where you plug in.
01:45:09.490 - 01:45:53.854, Speaker B: We'Re open source. But our observance is that this is going to totally change. I mean, at this point, I think. So $440,000,000,000 is sent globally into and the overheads on that process right now are just absolutely huge because you have to go through the banking services and the banking services just charge up to 20% which is just money that's basically managed to the ego. Organizations like Transferlight have got around this basically by doing peer to peer matching. The idea if I'm trying to send money between the US and Australia and someone's trying to send money from Australia to the US. Well, rather than going for the banking service you can have my money and I can have yours and we're done.
01:45:53.854 - 01:46:28.390, Speaker B: Which is really cut off because it skips that middle process. But it only works in places. It only allows you to skip banking processes in places where there's a symmetric flow of money in both directions. Right? The second you've got all of money flowing in one way then there's no one to match with and so the process breaks down. The really cool thing about these bonding curves and what we're doing with cryptocurrency, once you have the vendor network on the ground, you don't need the matching. So you can do asymmetric flows of money into places like Canyon. And we do some things that I'm also today about we basically repeg.
01:46:28.390 - 01:46:59.250, Speaker B: We repeg to the local currency using a synthetic asset. We take the same concept for what Dai does and then we do that to Dai again one more time so that then gets pegged to local currency that people aren't exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. And that repegging process is a lot more efficient than what goes on in regular markets because it's basically aggregating through miswat style exchanges. So we think there's some really interesting things that can be done there at a portable scale just to totally change the way we do financing and get money into communities.
01:47:00.070 - 01:47:32.814, Speaker E: Actually I was going to ask about that because people are exposed to US dollar price risk as well, right? And what is it like? Because most developing countries they would rather use the US dollar except obviously their governments would probably fall apart if they did. So isn't there kind of like a balancing act that if you're very successful and you allow people to essentially completely escape the shackles of their own local currency would they?
01:47:32.852 - 01:48:17.446, Speaker B: Just two answers to that. One is that we've noticed people often we haven't worked in a community yet where there's been like monetary failure or existing financial system breakdown. We like to work in communities where actually that asset of the financial system works well. And the reason we do that is because then we can use this synthetic asset process to pay to the local currency. And that means that a government retains control over their monetary policy. So if they want to artificially lower the price of their currency by an order of magnitude, just by printing infinite money, they're able to and there's nothing we can our system won't disrupt that. That's the design pragmatic choice of senpo.
01:48:17.446 - 01:48:26.666, Speaker B: That is the way you don't focus on governments. It's the way you end up going to jail. So yeah, we're yet to operate in a place like Venezuela.
01:48:26.698 - 01:49:05.894, Speaker A: Venezuela, Kenya. There's a blockchain task force there. The government, they're very excited about this idea of potentially creating a Kenyan Shilling, a digital Kenyan Shilling their own, and treating these exactly as they would the private banking world, right? So they create reserve currency. Banks can leverage that just like they do now. They have a 10% reserve requirement, right? Well, we're just saying, put that on chain and make it honest, because you don't really know does the bank have 10% reserve or not? And the bonding curve gives you transparency to that situation. And so we can basically say, well, let villages or groups also act. Like if the government wants them to have a reserve requirement, wonderful.
01:49:05.894 - 01:49:49.526, Speaker A: That's a great situation now. So they've just allowed communities now to act as their own banks and that would be a huge win. So I can see there can be a lot of play in the regulatory environment. If they want to start regulating this in that way by having some insurance or collateral requirements in their own tokens, wonderful. That could be a really wonderful way to bring governments on board. And I don't think Chase Bank should issue dollars or in Kenya, like Wells Fargo should not be issuing shillings, they should be issuing Wells Fargo shillings, right, which should be on a bonding curve. And they should be honest about how much reserve they have if they start, because we've had four banks over issue supply of credit and go bankrupt in the last four years and it's caused huge harm across the world.
01:49:49.526 - 01:50:10.878, Speaker A: I mean, this is not just Kenya, right? This is the whole world doing this. So if we can create honest banking this way and redo how we think about fractional reserve and put it on the blockchain, I think that would be a huge win. So I tend to lump this thing into that sort of like there was a movement towards transparent fractional reserve or something like that, that would be super.
01:50:11.044 - 01:51:06.990, Speaker B: Just to extend on that. I think the concept of Bitcoin or some sort of global reserve life about creating financial inclusion and actually being used like a payment process in emerging economies is just like a totally naive myth, including the suggestion that it will help save women's problems. Things like ripple communities fundamentally need to work on the currencies they used to. And so if you're talking about trying to use something like Bitcoin to shift your money efficiently between one community and the other, you need to take your Bitcoin or your ripple and then go through some sort of exchange process with a bank to then convert that into your local currency. You've basically missed out. You're going through the existing banking process again and all you've done is add an extra layer back into the pocket. So really, these sort of syntheticization processes and these ideas of creating on chain reserves is the only way this is actually going to create, like, borders?
01:51:09.510 - 01:51:16.686, Speaker A: Is cachet becoming more and more the way? Is that becoming more and more common among the ways that's it so drawing.
01:51:16.718 - 01:51:17.974, Speaker B: 40% year on year.
01:51:18.092 - 01:51:22.930, Speaker A: Okay, Red Cross, is that something that is happening more and more just like straight cash aid?
01:51:23.090 - 01:51:31.420, Speaker C: The global cash market right now is about red Cross accounts for a billion dollars a year.
01:51:31.790 - 01:51:34.010, Speaker A: And is it on? Like, is it growing quickly?
01:51:34.080 - 01:52:03.010, Speaker C: Yeah, the Red Cross is I mean, we did start actually looking at cash in itself as a component and understanding what that quantum is. A few years ago, it wasn't part of it. The United Nations is about 2.6 billion or so, and it counts for probably about 15% of our overall aid. And it's growing. I mean, 40% is I don't think it's quite 40% because that's a huge I mean, that would go from, like, five no.
01:52:03.080 - 01:52:11.878, Speaker B: So you're you're you're a year out of date. It's not $10 billion a year is transferred with cash growing that quickly. $10 billion now is on cash.
01:52:11.964 - 01:52:33.280, Speaker C: The latest number since 2018 yes. Was 4.6. I don't know if I fully agree with that. No, because when you give cash, there's different ways it's like cash to other organizations. How do they actually calculate what that cash is? Sometimes the actual handing out physical cash is about four points, but whatever. Still a shitload of money.
01:52:34.690 - 01:53:46.740, Speaker D: Can I just jump in? Yeah. I work a lot with you guys, but my specialty is cash transfer and delivery and humanitarian. So I think what's important to know that's not immediate knowledge in this space is that the local humanitarian summit had a bunch of commitments. Grand bargain callers from the world's biggest donors, but also from the member countries of the United Nations and local governments saying that one of the number one priorities today is to deliver the maximum amount of humanitarian aid possible in the form of payment. So whether it's cash in hand, whether it's like debit cards, whether it's using a blockchain rail, whether it's paper vouchers, that's considered the gold standard in humanitarian practice today, and that's what's really driving a lot of this growth. But the problem is that those actors that are delivering don't necessarily know and are not necessarily aware that there is now a technology that's like programmable money that can allow them to make their systems more efficient. So in that sense, I think it's a massive, untapped market of endless use cases for the blockchain sector to engage with.
01:53:47.290 - 01:54:10.330, Speaker B: I think we're out of time. So I'm going to put my Twitter or telegram is E-N-J-E-Y-W-N-J-W for my initials. But if you want to get in contact, I think we put my J W and Wills W O Federation.
