00:00:11.930 - 00:00:14.234, Speaker A: So hello everybody, my name is Dario.
00:00:14.362 - 00:00:22.750, Speaker B: Hello everybody, my name is Fernando. Both we are back for IO Builders which is a blockchain mentor studio in Madrid, Spain.
00:00:23.810 - 00:00:47.340, Speaker A: So today we want to present your Emoney token standard. It's a standard for financial payments and any operation that is using tokenized money. Some of the possible use cases that we were thinking about originally and that we have already implemented are bond issuing, supply chain, cash pooling market liquidity, smart league contracts but there are many more possible use cases for the standard.
00:00:48.270 - 00:01:00.000, Speaker B: So mainly the functionalities we were envisioning to include to the standard were compliance holds during payout and fundings that we are going to review probably in the next phase of that.
00:01:01.010 - 00:01:41.280, Speaker A: So our first building block was the compliance. So if compliance what we want to do is any compliance check like antimoney laundering or KYC to do it completely on chain. So can everything be done in one transaction? Another thing that we were thinking about was a multi token support. So it's not just one token that is supported per contract but is really several. And then one possible use case for this would be every government in the world could put up their own compliance smart contract with their specific compliance rules and every token that's regulated and forced under their jurisdiction could use this contract to check these rules and not have to implement their own implementation all the time.
00:01:42.050 - 00:02:11.510, Speaker B: The second building block is our keystone which is mainly warrantied health guaranteed alone. So you have health balance with the alone that can only be transferred on a given trigger. The trigger will be only done by a notary and the notary is the one who's going to execute it or either to release it or either the PE will release it and you can configure holds with a given expiration.
00:02:13.050 - 00:02:59.350, Speaker A: So the hoard we use like a thing that we build on top above. So one thing that we put on top is the clearing. So the clearing can just be imagined as a harbor transfer but it's done in two steps and not at one. So the second step is here needed because there will be compliance checks that need to be done off chain. So depending on the off chain compliance checks, a clearing agent can to decide to either execute to transfer or not. And the important thing here is because it's using the hold during these compliance checks the token are really held. So whenever a clearing agent makes his decisions, we assure that the tokens are really there in the account of the balance holder and are really there to be transferred.
00:03:00.330 - 00:03:46.340, Speaker B: And the last building block is mainly enabling decentralized start request into the funding and payout request. So mainly nowadays funding and payout requests must be done centralized. In this case we enable to do this request decentralized where we have a payment instruction. This payment instruction instructs the operator of the emoney token to either fund or either to pay out and the payment details are not disclosured inside the chain, they're interchange off chain and then the operator reads the family request of the other request and then tries to fulfill it.
00:03:47.030 - 00:04:14.142, Speaker A: So if you put all these four things together we come to our Imani token standard which is published by us under ERP 2020. So the important thing here is also it extends the ERC 20 so this means all the functions that you use in the ERC 20 are also supported there. And our main goal here is really that financial institutions have a way to embrace decentralization of the blockchain specifically so.
00:04:14.196 - 00:04:44.950, Speaker B: Standard needs user adoption. So this is why we have been working with different workgroups. So nowadays we are working with the top taxonomic initiative which is part of the EA mainly reshaping and fine tuning our standard. In the other way we are part of the ITU which has included our research into the last research of the ITU and the different board groups and their fine tuning and going deeper in our implementation.
00:04:45.530 - 00:05:08.830, Speaker A: So the standard is already finished, it can be used by anybody but we're also thinking about some other functionalities that we could add in the future. One thing would be overdrafts that we could use in the tokens, another thing would be the Escrows which would be a more complex hold but also implementing existing standards for standard error codes and localized error messages.
00:05:10.610 - 00:05:44.360, Speaker B: We have built this standard between three parties. Adara, which is a company also based in Spain, focused on liquidity market IO Builders, which we are based on, and Iocash is a product and the first venture was Iobuilder, which is a B to P payment platform based on tokenized euros with an emoney license and where you can check out more@emoneystander.org. And we are more than happy to bring more people on board and work together on this.
00:05:45.290 - 00:05:46.520, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:05:49.610 - 00:06:03.450, Speaker B: You Sam.
