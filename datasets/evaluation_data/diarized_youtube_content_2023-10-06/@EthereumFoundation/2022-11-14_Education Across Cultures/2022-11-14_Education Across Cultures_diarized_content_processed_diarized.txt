00:00:12.250 - 00:00:27.320, Speaker A: Everyone, thanks for being here. Thanks to the panelists. I guess let's just kick it off with a quick round of introductions. Let us know what you all do and what the projects you're working for do.
00:00:27.770 - 00:00:52.970, Speaker B: Okay, so my name is Camila Ramos and I'll preface it with saying we all have like 17 jobs, so I'll name the relevant ones here. I'm the head of developer relations at Fuel Labs. I'm a core contributor at Women Build Web three, which is what we're going to be focusing on today from my end. And I'm a lifelong educator. I've been in education for seven years now and that's what I did before becoming an engineer and then eventually before kind of transitioning back into education via Devrel.
00:00:54.110 - 00:01:13.730, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having me. My name is Avianshu. I work at Devfolio where we have built the biggest web3 dev community in India. We do different programs such as hackathons, fellowships, we do grants and a bunch of other stuff. We are also co host of ETH India, which is scheduled to be the biggest web3 Ethereum hackathon in Asia.
00:01:16.490 - 00:01:32.620, Speaker D: Hi, good afternoon everyone. My name is Yan, I'm from China. I'm a defined developer. Last year I built a developer community in China called. Yeah, we sponsored by foundation twice. Thanks.
00:01:36.350 - 00:02:01.890, Speaker E: Hello, I'm Ulaish. I'm here with it blockchain, which is biggest and first blockchain club in Turkey. We do lots of educational and event stuff and we are grantee in ESP with our open source bootcamp for smart contract developing. Also I'm smart contract developer in italian studio and I'm the biggest supporter of the constable proposal.
00:02:08.250 - 00:02:23.210, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks guys. What got you all motivated to start an educational series? Why is it important to educate and how did you all get involved with it?
00:02:23.360 - 00:03:01.922, Speaker E: I can start we as a university club. We want to be different from the other university club in our school, in our country. And we want to be a club which builds, which produce, which makes lots of beneficial stuff as a public good. And in first we couldn't do anything because we are very started at the first times and first we educated ourselves. Then we realized that we need more friends to build together. Then we do a few groups to help people to learn something. Then it failed.
00:03:01.922 - 00:03:22.010, Speaker E: Then we thought we should do more open more accessible content so that we can have people to join web3 development. Then we see lots of people from Turkey are learning with us. Then we see we are joining hackathons.
00:03:22.090 - 00:04:00.300, Speaker C: And only the top tier folks who get access to premium institutes. They get a lot of opportunities while the other folks really don't also. So we thought, that's some BS. What we did was we started doing our programs and what really got us into the ethereum ecosystem was the ethos of decentralization, being accessible, being permissionless. So we started off with ETH India in 2018, and since then we have done a bunch of ETH India and ethnia online hackathons. Like I said, we have done fellowships and yeah, we have been doing since then. We are now at 250,000 devs in our community.
00:04:00.300 - 00:04:04.140, Speaker C: We're still going strong and we'll talk more about it.
00:04:06.750 - 00:05:06.160, Speaker D: Thank you. Last May, I helped my friends to hold a hack zone in China and worked as the advisor. During today's competition, I found many developers. There was a huge gap among the developers, although most of them know how to code with solidity. But many of them don't know the base components of dev development, such as using Chainlink, graph IPFs. Few of them know the famous project Scaffold ETH, which can save them a lot of time developing their MMVP in Hackathon. And so they spend too much time on Google.
00:05:06.160 - 00:05:35.586, Speaker D: So at the same time, my friend Jolie, who wanted to learn blockchain, so I advised him to learn dev development directly. It can save you a lot of time. Then I had the idea to build open source project to help developers to learn dev development. We called the open source project dev learning directly. So that's my motivation.
00:05:35.698 - 00:05:36.600, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:05:37.370 - 00:06:19.558, Speaker B: Yeah, so women build Web three is a community for intermediate and advanced developers. And I came from a web two background. I was an engineer at PayPal, and I kind of started experimenting with crypto and blockchain development on the side. And when I was ready to dive in, there weren't really that many communities specifically for my type of person. I found a lot of communities were onboarding women and were doing kind of zero to one stuff. And I was looking for where can I go from like one to ten? How can I actually start building, given that I have all of the baseline things to start? And it came together around web3 con, which is the hackathon that developer dow organizes. And we were all kind of like, how do we find teammates who are women that are kind of on my level so we can build something dope? And we realized there really didn't exist that community.
00:06:19.558 - 00:06:39.578, Speaker B: And I just happened to tweet out. This was back like six months ago, before I had Twitter followers and I just happened to tweet. Is there anyone who wants to be on my team who's like an engineer, who's a girl, we can build something cool. And I expected maybe two or three people to reach out. And maybe like 45 women ended up reaching out and being like, I want to participate. Like, I've been looking for something like this. So that's how we initially got together.
00:06:39.578 - 00:07:35.310, Speaker B: We hacked, we shipped a bunch of cool stuff, and after we looked around and we're like, all right, we have this really cool community of engineers. What should we do next? And as we were experimenting, potentially expanding the program that we built, or the project we built at the hackathon, we realized there really wasn't a lot of high quality educational resources that were up to date that weren't like blatant shills. So there's a lot of platforms out there that have kind of like their own type, of course, but they basically just keep using their thing over and over. And we really couldn't find anything where we could kind of level up for blockchain development. And as we got together, we decided, let's build this open source course called building full stack Dapps, where we walk people through everything from writing a smart contract, writing API, writing their front end, doing off chain storage, and kind of just getting through the full stack and not just putting the education out there, but really walking people through it. Because our goal was less about teaching you how to code. We're not going to sit there and teach you what a struct is and what an array is.
00:07:35.310 - 00:08:25.806, Speaker B: We actually just give you the code and we kind of focus on bigger picture thing where it's like, now you have this architectural reference for how to build a DAP, and then you can tweak it and go back and learn the things that you maybe don't know. But now you have this thing that you can fork and always build something that works from. And since we launched it, we launched it in English and Spanish. Over 10,000 lines of curriculum and over 2500 devs have taken it so far. And that was kind of part one of our initiative. And then we started thinking, okay, how can we support the teams that come from this? How can we stick to our mission of supporting the growth of developers? So then we worked with the EF and a bunch of other amazing organizations who contributed to our project to start an accelerator where we're deploying $150,000 directly to teams with no strings attached just to support their projects. And kind of just be like, we just want to give money to people building dope stuff and that's where we are now.
00:08:25.806 - 00:08:31.230, Speaker B: We just accepted our first cohort, the accelerator like this week and it launches officially on Monday.
00:08:32.210 - 00:09:13.550, Speaker A: That is awesome. Thanks for everyone for the work that you're doing and for all the people that you've already onboarded to this space. It's something that's incredibly important. So something that you've all sort of touched on in this last part. The title is education across cultures. So how do you all think about the cultural nuances or the language barriers or something specific to your region or community? When creating educational content, we are trying.
00:09:13.620 - 00:10:05.050, Speaker E: To prepare our contents by thinking how we can learn by these contents. We had too much time to learn them and maybe we see lots of contents and we can combine them and create a content like how we can learn. And our friends are similar to us and how they can learn. It's one of the k or what we try to do. Also we prepared our lots of contents. Coding comments or namings are in English. We are not pushing them to doing everything in Turkish, just we are trying to tell what is the on what we are doing that and it's just only turkish parts.
00:10:05.050 - 00:10:17.010, Speaker E: We are preparing them to do really sectoral stuff and help them by their native language as banning the barriers.
00:10:18.790 - 00:11:05.570, Speaker C: So thankfully we don't have to translate language of the content given that in India English is normally speaking and also the language of education. But how we go about educating folks and onboarding them to web3 is and our motto is never stop building. So how we go about it is even in our fellowships where we take them through a curriculum, everything is focused on building. So every module has a task where you have to build something out and the entire eight week course finalizes culminates into a final building sprint. So as long as a building, we believe if you build you'll learn. So that's what we have been focusing on. So any program that we do is kind of centered around building projects.
00:11:07.750 - 00:12:04.660, Speaker D: Okay. Most content over our GitHub is still chinese, but I wanted to introduce is that our government rules? That is very interesting. We attract most of chinese excellent developers and overseas chinese developers. First of all, our community is a nonprofit organization. Core members are driven by interest and passion. We are funded by grant and donation grant such as Eder Foundation Grant, Gitcoin grant donations such as chinese famous project like Luprin Squirrel novice. Our government has three points.
00:12:04.660 - 00:13:17.546, Speaker D: The first one is that people who submit a poor request or give a sharing meeting in our community can join our developer group. So it helped me gather many talent developers in our community to help us build together. At the same time, they can enjoy high quality communication with other developers. The second one is that with more and more developers join our community. We set a limit of 120 people, but we build a new communication group that there is no thread sword here. The last one is an interesting one, that we are high quality, qualified developers. So many guys wanted to advise or post a recruitment in our community.
00:13:17.546 - 00:13:36.080, Speaker D: So we add a rule that you must give a sharing meeting to show your technology level. Then you can send a recruitment post in our community. Thank you.
00:13:36.530 - 00:14:08.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us, we shipped, like I said initially, everything in English and Spanish, and that was important to us, to not have it be later translated as like a second thought. But rather we want to be inclusive. And obviously that's not every language in the world. We're not impacting all the developers in the, you know, the culture of our community is shaped by those in it. And it just so happens that some of our core contributors are latino. So that's how it worked out that way. But I think there's a really special kind of nuance about Latin America that isn't really understood by developer communities focused in North America and Europe.
00:14:08.054 - 00:15:05.002, Speaker B: Is that similar to kind of hacker culture? 20, 30, 40 years ago, before, computer science was really something that you could take in school, people who learned how to code just like learned on their own, they were hackers. So computer science people weren't always academics. And it's a similar story in Latin America where if you're a coder, it runs the possibility that you actually don't speak English because you might not have gone to college, you might have just learned how to code by yourself. And for us that's like a huge problem because we're missing out on all of the talent that is actually good engineering talent, but everything is in English. So that's something that we keep in mind where in Latin America, the way it kind of works is that if you go to a good school and if you go to university and you get the privilege of being educated, you probably know English because they teach it in school. But if you come from that background where you're not offered that opportunity, but you somehow get to teach yourself how to code, which that in and of itself is a huge feat. We as a community are giving them more blockers where everything's in English.
00:15:05.002 - 00:15:42.060, Speaker B: All of the Ethereum conferences are in North America and Europe where they can't get visas. So this year for me was really special to see Devcon be in Colombia. This is where I'm from. But outside of that, ETH global also focused on Latin America this year, doing a bunch of hackathons here for the very first time. And I think just this was a really good place for us to get together because I think more people are starting to think globally and are starting to think about what happens when we don't think of others. And not just from a moral perspective. Like, we should do this because it's good, because we should, but we should do this if we want innovation and if we want the best talent from all over the world, we have to be able to reach them.
00:15:43.870 - 00:15:59.760, Speaker A: And what do you think needs to happen for us to reach more people, either globally or in your local communities? What is something that's missing that we need to reach and educate more people?
00:16:02.210 - 00:16:03.120, Speaker C: I think.
00:16:06.610 - 00:16:07.950, Speaker F: From sector.
00:16:11.970 - 00:16:12.542, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:16:12.596 - 00:16:40.460, Speaker E: Hi. Okay. When some newcomers see some experts from the sector, for example, some good developers from ethereum, they are more willing to do something or they are more willing to learn something. I think some events or hackathons or little educations that focused on some little regions can be more effective to take more newcomers to the real world.
00:16:41.230 - 00:17:07.506, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the answer is pretty straightforward. Just like, give money, give money, let the experts in the field do what they do. It's not scalable for us to be like, we're going to go to every country and do an ETH hackathon and try to translate everything in Spanish. It's more sustainable to instead empower people who are already leaders in their communities. Give them money, give them resources, give them support, and just let them do their thing. And that's exactly what ITU is. A great example of that.
00:17:07.506 - 00:17:27.340, Speaker B: They are from Istanbul and they just decided like, hey, we want to see a change. They got support from the EF and other people, and now there's a growing community to the point that Devcon might be there next year, simply because this one group of kids decided that they wanted to start this community. And a community like us happened to get behind them. So just give money.
00:17:28.750 - 00:18:09.180, Speaker C: I agree. So EF has been great, giving support to all the programs and everything that has been happening across the globe. But also adding to his point, I think we need more advocates, we need more educators. And the reason why also we are calling ETH India the biggest, Asia's biggest Ethereum hackathon is there are not a lot of events happening there. Like Camila mentioned, it's a lot of events in North America now, in Letham as well, but not that much in, let's say, Asia. So the idea is to bring in more advocates, bring in more exposure, and I think for the rest, TF has been great supporting us.
00:18:11.310 - 00:18:58.550, Speaker D: Okay. Our community is not only a developer community. We also translate MIT open course, blockchain and money taught by Sec. Charman. It's a very wonderful course that we translated it to Chinese and summarize it to help more people to know blockchain and web3. What's more, we also translate the soviet individuals. This book is also a very wonderful book to help people know cryptocurrency.
00:18:58.550 - 00:19:06.540, Speaker D: So through this way, we attract many non developers to join our community. Okay.
00:19:09.630 - 00:19:27.220, Speaker A: Does it work? Yes, it does. What are some of the biggest. No, I was just testing, testing, testing. So what are some of the biggest challenges that you have faced in getting to this point and how do you see your project evolving, moving forward?
00:19:28.310 - 00:19:52.140, Speaker C: Right. Like I said. So what we do is we work with a bunch of educators and mentors. It has been a challenge to find a lot of them. Folks like Austin Griffith and Patrick Collins have been of help, but I don't think we have enough. So I would ask people to get more into education and get more into advocacy. But for our community, a couple of challenges that have been there.
00:19:52.140 - 00:20:30.854, Speaker C: One is that in India, while Web three and Ethereum is going mainstream in the dev community, it's still not going mainstream for the end users. So oftentimes what we see is the devs who are building for the community, who is building is not the end user. So that's a problem that we have faced and we are kind of trying to solve for. And again with web3 and with the ethereum, a lot of folks are in it for, I would say, not the right motivations. So we have been kind of focused on finding that right signal compared to all the fluff that is in the ecosystem. So that's something that we have been trying to tackle and focus on.
00:20:31.052 - 00:21:32.538, Speaker E: I think two biggest challenges are motivation and sustainability. We should motivate our educators to do something in continuous way. They should do their responsibilities on time. It's one of the biggest problems. And how we are deal with them is showing some results, showing some people who learned with us, showing our resource in some other places and the sustainability about that we cannot do everything in each year. Some newcomers should take our place and give some more better things than us. If we can find some newcomers and we can help them to do some real things, it will be great.
00:21:32.538 - 00:21:47.760, Speaker E: And we are dealing with them with doing more educations, more meetups, more workshops, and I can't say we deal with both of them, but we are working and we are talking with our friends to how to deal with them.
00:21:50.610 - 00:23:18.890, Speaker D: There are two challenges we are facing now. The first one is that how to internationalize our community. We are not only wanted to be a local community but also meet global developers. We have invited many famous project developers to give a Shani meeting in our community like Stockware, Inferra and Mina. But you know, I find an interesting phenomenon is that in China I see many talent developers who are good at math and coding, but their English is not so well, is there, limited. So we are trying our best to translating our project and invite more international project to give a Shani meeting. The second one is that with our project motor accumulating, it is becoming more and more harder for newcomers to join us to make a contribution and become the corn contributor.
00:23:20.590 - 00:23:52.178, Speaker B: I think for us the biggest challenge has been, and we're kind of just heading it now, is kind of sustainability. We never wanted to be a community that was funded by grants because that's just not sustainable. And we actually came together around April like Peak bull market. And it was really easy to get support from organizations, but we kind of knew that just wasn't the path we wanted to go out. So we had this idea to be a service dow where we would do Devrel. And that's kind of how this idea of the open source course that we did came from. We're like, you guys need Devrel, you can't hire Devrel.
00:23:52.178 - 00:24:08.198, Speaker B: We're educators who are willing to create this content as a public good, so pay us for it. And that's what happened. And it went amazing. But now things have changed. Companies, it turns out you actually have to keep working to do it. And we're like, wow, we just did six months of work to build this course. We're exhausted.
00:24:08.198 - 00:24:51.878, Speaker B: We don't really want to do this again because where is the time to then work on our own skills and kind of tend to the mission that we first set out to be? So for us, I think we're thinking through how can we sustainably stay alive and fund our core team who's working and make sure that they're taken care of? Fund all of the things that we need to pay for, which aren't much, right. But we do need money to continue the projects that we're doing. And it's really a matter of how do we split up our limited time between being a service dow and making money to sustain ourselves and then actually serving our members and serving ourselves by using that money and putting it to use. And in this first iteration, that looks like the accelerator. But now we're kind of like, all right, we're going to spend all the money in our treasury, which is good. That was what we wanted. We wanted to deploy all the money.
00:24:51.878 - 00:25:28.390, Speaker B: The goal is not to build up a huge treasury and just have it. The goal is to deploy. And now we're thinking through, how do we do this again without doing six months of work? Because that was scary and it was a lot of work. And imagine it was a team of like 30 people working ten to 20 hours a week for four and a half months to deliver the highest quality content in English and Spanish, and then coordinating speakers, coordinating the VCs that we wanted them to talk to, coordinating the supporters, coordinating the mentors. So that's kind of our problem is like, what's next for us? How do we do it sustainably and still stay true to our mission?
00:25:29.370 - 00:25:40.360, Speaker A: And building on something that you said, I guess, is how do you all think of forkability and open sourcing the content and everything that you're working on?
00:25:41.450 - 00:26:14.014, Speaker B: Yeah, no, all our stuff is open sourced. We encourage people to make PRS against it, keep it up to date as a community. Part of our treasury goes to paying our contributor readers to make sure that that stays up to date because obviously we don't want to be those projects we were kind of trying to solve the problem for, which is that there is a lot of education, but if you leave it alone for a month, it's already out of date. If you leave it alone for a week, it's probably already out of date. And when you build something like we did with literally like six or seven protocols, that thing, you need to work on it every day if you want it to still work. So it's open for contributions. Women build web3 on GitHub.
00:26:14.014 - 00:26:15.640, Speaker B: Go update it.
00:26:16.810 - 00:27:06.562, Speaker E: When we start to create our contents, we have a few promises between our team. One is being free and never accept any money from our learners, and other one is being open source to reach more audience by our content. If someone can fork our education and do something better, we will be really happier. Also, if someone use our content and makes another content, it's really good for us. It shows our work is really beneficial and we can reach lots of people with them. And we always think everybody can use our education. Everybody can add our education to their contents.
00:27:06.562 - 00:27:21.820, Speaker E: Also, we get some offers to add our education to their learning schedule. And we say it's only open source and it's everyone's. And we are open for everything.
00:27:24.670 - 00:27:42.320, Speaker C: Well, while our fellowship curriculum is not open source right now, we are planning for it. We want to open source it. Currently it's maintained by our team, which is a task. But yeah, the plan is to open source it so the community can drive it and we can go from there.
00:27:44.550 - 00:28:33.840, Speaker D: In my opinion, GitHub notion and Google Doc is necessary. If someone wanted to join our community, you can request, then our core contributor will view your request and merge. Or not. If someone wanted to give a shiny meeting in our community, you just write down your schedule on our Google Doc and we will arrange a meeting for you. So it's very decentralized and easy for compilation. The second one is we are trying our best to translate our content into English. We force our developers to learn English too.
00:28:35.590 - 00:29:07.500, Speaker A: Yeah, so as someone working, spending most of my time on an open source project, which is ethereum.org, I can also say that open sourcing stuff can lead to massive improvements. A lot of why ethereum.org is a great resource is because anyone can contribute to the code or the content or the design or the translations. All the aspects of it, really. I think we're approaching time. Does anyone else have any questions?
00:29:12.030 - 00:29:13.100, Speaker F: I'm coming.
00:29:20.850 - 00:29:49.674, Speaker G: Thank you for this panel. I really agree with most of the thing that the panelists said. So I just want to like a bit background. We're a group of Farsi speakers that we studied in 2014 on working on blockchain education and all nonprofit. We even translated ethereum.org to farsi. One of the main challenges we have is we never got any reply from any of the funds, EF included, just because of the keyword Iran, I think.
00:29:49.674 - 00:30:16.846, Speaker G: And we even got our gift and grants for nonprofit education done by women. Blockchain Parsi suspended just because of the keyword Iran. And we are really challenging. We're self funded for the last eight years, and I would say it's our last breath. And we really need the support. Like, even motivational support. Just, I say, hey, you guys doing well or something? Not even just funds.
00:30:16.846 - 00:30:30.150, Speaker G: Just want to say this is a unique challenge we're facing. And I really want the community to talk about this rather than just do the sanction treatment, which is like, not do not engage. And yeah, that's mainly.
00:30:31.050 - 00:30:45.820, Speaker B: Thanks for bringing that up, really. Thank you. I don't have any rules, so apply for a grant through women. Build web3. We deploy capital directly to teams doing cool things like you guys. So happy to talk after. I'm sure the EF team.
00:30:45.820 - 00:30:54.080, Speaker B: I don't know what their response is, but I'm sure you could talk to someone in person today, and I'm sure they're super grateful for all of your contributions. And yes, let's please talk after this.
00:30:55.170 - 00:30:58.990, Speaker F: Anybody else have anything to add? Rob.
00:31:05.830 - 00:31:27.830, Speaker A: I was wondering, do you find there's like content, like the subjects of the examples of your tutorials or the technology in your tutorials that are culturally specific or motivating? Like something in one culture wouldn't work in another in terms of the examples.
00:31:30.410 - 00:32:08.870, Speaker E: Also, thanks for drop. One of the first tutorials in our club was with Rob from remix. And thank you again. We are preparing our contents, like thinking how it benefits to persons to work in a global project and create a global impact with their knowledge. So we don't do any cultural specific content, but we think cultural specific things only on thinking about how our friends can learn by our contents.
00:32:09.850 - 00:33:07.410, Speaker B: We don't do any cultural specific things by geographic region, but as a community of women and nonbinary people, we have noticed, and through just my career as an educator, I've noticed work that has to do with improving real humans lives is what writes the generalization. Okay, but women tend to be more interested in things like that, where it's like an example of, I don't know, minting a token hasn't really been that impactful. But when we talk about how this can actually affect real people in real communities, people are a lot more excited about that in our community specifically. So for our course, for example, instead of doing some financial use case, which is good, the group kind of decided to do this web3 version of Eventbrite. If you know the platform, it's like an event creation and management platform. And then from there, all the teams that have applied to the accelerator, and I know because I've read the applications, they're all like solving real world problems. And then it's just funny as like a hackathon judge and an educator, then you go to a hackathon and see the projects by men, and it's like 1000% yield farming.
00:33:07.410 - 00:33:16.794, Speaker B: Cryptodigbut.com it's like all the craziest things. So not like region specific, but I do think there's like a cultural piece there amongst women versus men. Thank you.
00:33:16.832 - 00:33:18.220, Speaker F: We have one more over here.
00:33:18.990 - 00:33:57.986, Speaker H: Just two minutes. Last year, so we worked on creating some learning content, and I have some credentials working with a community of close to 17,000 developers. So just a suggestion for all of you to think about the framework in which you are building your learning content and communities. So the way we looked at it is learning is not a standalone silo in the web3 world. Specifically. If you are looking at making learners web3 builders, you should look at it as learn, collaborate, build and earn. All the four are important if you want your learners to get tangible outcomes.
00:33:57.986 - 00:34:45.400, Speaker H: So the most important thing here that a lot of people leave out is the collaborate part. How can you look at your learners immediately finding some things avenues to collaborate with people and working on? So typically learning starts. A lot of people attempt the one on ones, but beyond that the real fun starts when people start looking at intermediate to advanced learning. That's where you start building. And for that when you have a group of people collaborating, they can start building great stuff. And this is where contributing to the ecosystem, getting some grants, all those things come into picture. So when you are looking at improving or expanding your communities, please look at the collaboration part and it'll contribute to the entire ecosystem in a large way.
00:34:48.010 - 00:35:07.760, Speaker C: Actually that is something that you're right, that works very well because for our fellowships we usually onboard 25 to 50 devs and what we have seen is after the cohort as well, they stick to whatever communication medium they are at and it's great where they are bouncing off ideas. They are building stuff together. So collaboration is also a key part. I think.
00:35:08.210 - 00:36:04.000, Speaker E: We don't have cord source stations in the terms, but we have small developers group in our university community and we are trying to motivate them to build something together. This can be little groups projects or this can be attending some online or physical hackathons. And we do the earn part by motivating people to when they create something beneficial for the club, for the community, they will get its revenue by earning the profits of earning the grants of all of the stuff, all of the education, by maybe going another hackathon in another country, maybe reaching some educational content. It's our way to motivate people to collaborate and earn something.
00:36:05.170 - 00:36:28.530, Speaker F: Thank you. I think we're just about time now. And before you guys leave, I just wanted to have two quick announcements. Well, and one other thing. Luca didn't get to introduce himself whenever he started this panel, and I just want to mention that him, along with the ethereum.org team, has been able to get the website translated into 50 languages. I mean, I mentioned that earlier on her talk, but I just think that's an amazing feat.
00:36:28.610 - 00:36:29.640, Speaker B: Snap. There.
