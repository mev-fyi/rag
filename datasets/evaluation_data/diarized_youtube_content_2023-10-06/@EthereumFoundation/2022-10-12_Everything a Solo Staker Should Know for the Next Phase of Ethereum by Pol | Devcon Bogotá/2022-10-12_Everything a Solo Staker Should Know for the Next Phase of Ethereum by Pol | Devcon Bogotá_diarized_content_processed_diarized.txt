00:00:08.730 - 00:00:43.190, Speaker A: Okay, good. No, I hope the talk that we're going to have today convinces these last group of people that this might not be the best decision for Ethereum and that it's actually not that hard to take cards into your own matter and to actually start doing it yourself. So, yeah, let's go for it. This is what Vitalik published not that long ago, and this is the roadmap of Ethereum. And solo stakers are people that are not professional stakers. They're not professional validators. They're people that have their own jobs.
00:00:43.190 - 00:01:39.258, Speaker A: They're people that might or might not have children, they might have hobies, they might have other things to do than just keeping up with this. So how the heck are they supposed to keep up with all of this? And that's the purpose of this talk. We're going to try to lay down in the next 25 minutes the next things that are going to be huge and that are going to impact us all as solo stakers and that we need to take into account and how to react with it. So first of all, let to try to convince these people that are still staking with Kraken, okay? So it is vital that there are more solo stakers. The reason of this talk is because we need to convince you that you can stake and that is actually worth it. It is vital for Ethereum and it's actually an existential threat to Ethereum if we don't have enough solo stakers. So we all have seen this.
00:01:39.258 - 00:02:27.002, Speaker A: We all have seen how very few entities control a huge majority of the validators. Who here remembers the steam fiasco, the blockchain steam fiasco, right. So actually having centralized validators, or centralized it actually can do things like steam fiasco was just in. Sun bought Steemit, which was a company that was behind the blockchain steam. And there were some people that did not agree with him. So he basically went to Poloniex and a few other exchanges and said like, hey guys, take this couple Milli and we're going to vote for an invalid state transaction. When the accounts of these opponents of mine are going to be emptied from one block to another.
00:02:27.002 - 00:03:11.740, Speaker A: Imagine your Ethereum accounts emptied like this invalid state transaction. This is what happens when we got centralized validators. So yes, it is dangerous, okay? But not only this, there's even a more insidious thing that's happening in Ethereum right now. Right now we have compliant block production through things like MeV Boost. We have a 32% of the blocks being produced in Ethereum right now. A 32% of blocks produced that are OFAC compliant. That means that if you have ever used tornado cash, there's a 32% of the blocks where your transactions are not going in.
00:03:11.740 - 00:03:36.106, Speaker A: Did you know that? Did you know that you're being censored in 32% of the blocks? This is huge. And this is Mev Boost. And if we go into the MEV boost produced blocks, this is 87% come from relayers that have said that they are going to comply with OFAC. This is why it's so important. Right. Okay, so, brief introduction to dab node. Dab node.
00:03:36.106 - 00:03:58.120, Speaker A: We're here to make it easy. We're here to make it easier for people to run nodes. We provide a UI, you don't even need to be technical. There's auto updates, so you don't need to do the testing. We test for you, and then we push the updates and it will be updated. This saves about 72 hours of DevOps. DevOps work per year only on Geth and prism, for example.
00:03:58.120 - 00:04:32.050, Speaker A: Then there's like all sorts of nice, beautiful things, like a web3 sign that holds the keys for you, et cetera, et cetera. And there's a huge community of thousands of validators that are doing the exact same thing as you and where you can just rely on them, ask for support, et cetera. This is one of the things that we have done. This is what you need. This is what you see. This is the UI that you will use in order to set up a validator. You need to choose your execution client, choose your consensus client, put the keys into the remote signer, or use optionally, Meb boost.
00:04:32.050 - 00:04:57.946, Speaker A: Okay, enough. The thing that a solo staker needs to know is that you are the key for the future of Ethereum. All right, Mev. Okay, so Mev. MeV stands for maximal extractable value. And the first thing that we need to know here is that the value is extracted from who? From the user. People say, like, oh, Mev, but they're doing nice things.
00:04:57.946 - 00:05:37.480, Speaker A: They do arbitrage between Dexes. So we can, like, if I have a token, my price will be the same everywhere. Yeah, that's a good thing, right? But how about everything else? You got price execution in every trade that you do in a Dex, you got gas wars and network congestion. Whenever there's like a juicy MeV opportunity, you get the potential and the threat of chain reorgs if there's something really juicy and the conditions are right and the validators are incentivized to attack themselves. So if I come after a block where there's a really juicy MeV opportunity, I'm incentivized to screw up the guy that comes before me so I can keep the MeV opportunity. Right.
00:05:38.410 - 00:06:27.270, Speaker B: Okay, so yes, how to map all of this related to Meb? So mainly for me and for most of us, Meb is not a feature, it's a bug. It has a lot of implications on the Ethereum design because of that, because it's something that is leading in the wrong direction. So mainly PBS has formed to try to mitigate this situation, PBS proposal block separation. And we are going to talk about that later on. So that is why the consent of the community and the researcher to try to mitigate as much as we can the MEB. And that is why we are starting to see new proposals like single slot finality. Single slot finality is a proposal to be able to have finality in just one epoch.
00:06:27.270 - 00:07:06.930, Speaker B: And the idea is to remove these opportunities from the protocol itself, but also the single secretary leader election that is related to the validator anonymity is something that is also researching right now, and we are talking later on. So mainly we are seeing how the cinema foundation is trying to find ways to mitigate this situation at a protocol level. But there are some things that we cannot mitigate. So far, we have seen that it's really, really hard to find a solution to MEB. So that is why the PBS or MEb smoothing is a way to make this more fair and try to mitigate these situations.
00:07:07.850 - 00:07:11.240, Speaker A: All right, so what do you need to know for me?
00:07:13.050 - 00:07:13.622, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:07:13.676 - 00:07:58.082, Speaker A: Yeah. MeV is a centralizing force. It's a centralizing force because MeV researchers will not give you as a solo staker, a juicy 10 million MeV opportunity. Because you, as a solo staker that has only 42,032 ETH in your validator, you would be happy to take this 10 million, shut down your validator and go live in the Bahamas for the rest of your life. So it is a trustful system. And as a solo staker, you cannot access MeV opportunities if you don't use MeV boost right now. In the future, PBS provides the same separation of powers and allows for easier builder decentralization and removes the need to trust the builder of the block.
00:07:58.082 - 00:08:34.998, Speaker A: But right now, MeV is a huge centralizing force that basically makes that us as solo stakers will only have two sources of revenue, which are block production, so block reward and transaction fees. And the big companies, the big trusted companies that can sign agreements would have those two. Plus meb opportunities. So Meb boost is for now, as solo stakers, the only solution that we have to access this revenue.
00:08:35.114 - 00:08:48.870, Speaker B: Yeah, mainly the feeling that we are having with semi B is that we are putting the incentivization in the ground plates. We are incentivized people to extract this value from users. So that is why we should try to find a way to remove this from the protocol.
00:08:50.330 - 00:09:42.354, Speaker A: Okay, DVT. DVT is the next hot topic and it's distributed validators. So right now there's this equality of one validator key, one validator client, which basically means that whoever runs the machine, whoever runs the validator client also has access to that key and can do all sorts of bad things to this. It can slash you, it can ransom you, it can just exit you, it can just shut the validator down. So you get inactivity leak and DVT comes in. So the DVT comes in, so you can split the validator key in different key shares and distribute it over many validator clients. This allows for high availability, because imagine these validator shares as sort of like a multi sig.
00:09:42.354 - 00:10:38.966, Speaker A: So if three of these shares are online out of four, so if one of them are offline, we can still continue validating. It also allows for different trust assumptions because you can distribute these shares, so nobody with one of these shares, you can't slash people, you can't exit, you can't do all of this stuff. So actually we do not require so much. We can afford to give these keys to other people and not require so much collateral. Right now, rocket pool still requires somebody to put 16 e huge amount of collateral because that's what they can get from, that's how much damage they can do. So with DVT, we get a different trust assumption and the potential for lower collateral requirements. Moreover, those who already run nodes and already have a validator set up, they can monetize through DVT technologies on top of their validator sets.
00:10:38.966 - 00:11:33.910, Speaker A: So it's a way to bump up your rewards for having a validator. Okay, so that's exactly what you need to know about DVT. You'll be able to monetize your machine by leveraging other protocols on top of it. These protocols are like SSV Network or OBel or Diva, and that people will be able to participate in validation even with less than 32 E, because you can do a setup and then you can participate in this, which is great for accessibility, because we're making part of the benefits of running infrastructure to people that are not rich to people that do not have 32 E. So it's great for accessibility. All right, withdrawals, withdrawals, withdrawals. That's all we're waiting for, right? Like we've got this 32 e withdrawals are going to be a new system level operation which will have no gas cost and they will not even go to the VEM.
00:11:33.910 - 00:12:05.300, Speaker A: They will increase the balance of the withdrawal address automatically. It'll be a limited block per block, just like right now. Joining as a validator is also limited block per block. There's a limited amount of people that can join the validator set. The same thing will happen with withdrawals. And what we need to know is that we will be able to get our money if we want to. Now, there's something more interesting to think about here, which is what will happen when people are able to take this.
00:12:05.300 - 00:12:29.180, Speaker A: Will staking pools be, will people take out of staking pools and start solo staking? That's what we're hoping. Or will the opposite happen? So what's going to make it easier to convince people to take out of staking pools and centralized exchanges and start running. And start running it themselves?
00:12:30.130 - 00:13:38.546, Speaker B: All right, so yeah, now it's time to talk about prototype sharding and the future of resilium. So mainly the roadmap of studio changed completely at the moment that Vitalik make this Reddit post. So mainly we realized that if we facilitate roll ads, they have better scalability and potential than the previous execution shards. So mainly everything changed at that moment. We forget about having execution on the shards and we move to a way to provide data validity for other L2 application that are going to happen during these years. So Melissa, thing that happened with prototype starting is that instead of providing more space for transactions, we are going to provide more space for data that the L2 solutions can use it in the future. So the idea is mainly that the execution is going to happen on these CKVMs and roll ups, keeping the execution part of Ethereum as it is, and mainly from the point of view, validator is just a way to validate the data that's available.
00:13:38.546 - 00:14:39.970, Speaker B: So it's not going to include the need of validate this data as in the state of Ethereum. So yeah, what you need to know about this melee, the bitcoin chain is going to store these new blocks and the data is going to be used by the roll apps. So Melly, the idea is that you get a Berkele tree approved of this data and you can use a pre compiled smart contract in Ethereum that validates this data, allowing them to verify the state of these L2 solutions. Yeah, mainly the idea behind this is like solution, like the CKBM, like Polygon yesterday, that are going to be able to have a proof of the state and take the security of Ethereum inside these L2 solutions. So mainly Ethereum is trying to provide these new tools for these kind of solutions, making the scalability going in that direction.
00:14:40.130 - 00:15:17.220, Speaker A: So what do we need to know? We need to know that those blobs, those new blobs of data will be stored in the beacon chain, which will mean that our beacon chains as validators, auto stakers will grow, will bloat. But hey, it will not grow indefinitely because this data will only be stored for about a month. So that's great. So our beacon chains will not just continuously grow and grow and grow, at least the part of the blobs, but every month we'll be deleting this data. So it will grow, but it will now grow indefinitely, right?
00:15:17.590 - 00:16:07.970, Speaker B: Yeah, next big topic, anonymity. Yeah, that's also a critical point of the network. So yeah, the thing is, since we are using random in the becoming chain to select the validator proposals, it's possible to know beforehand who is going to be the next one. And since we are using leap to B network to communicate with this node, it's also possible to get the IP of the nodes. So mainly the thing is that since we have also MIF in this situation, people want or could try to attack these nodes because they can get the minor extraction value or the maximal extraction value from the block. So at the end is the same problem that before we are putting the integration to attack the network. So we are making right integrations for the solar stakers.
00:16:07.970 - 00:16:49.706, Speaker B: But this is not just that. The thing is, the single secret leader election is a protocol that is going to allow to hide who is going to be the next proposal. And with that you can protect this kind of attacks. And this is something that is already in the blockchain, in the protocol. And it's obviously very important to protect the privacy of the validators. So what you need to know about this? Yeah, because the list of proposal of the new epoch are node, it's possible to be targeted by these attackers. This new protocol protects the privacy of the validators at the moment to provoke the block.
00:16:49.706 - 00:17:02.740, Speaker B: But we need also new ways to hide the communication between nodes, because the IP is still exposed. So that is why private solutions like Hopper or other can provide this kind of privacy protection at IP level.
00:17:03.910 - 00:17:08.390, Speaker A: Right, next hot topic, statelessness and PBS.
00:17:10.090 - 00:18:06.902, Speaker B: Yeah, a good one. So yeah, this has been a hot topic in the research part of the protocol from several years ago. So mainly the thing that we have right now is that we need to have all the state of execution client to be able to verify the next block. So this is a problem because we are taking all the complexity, all the historical data from Ethereum, and we need to store this in our devices to be a solo stakers. So mainly the proposal is to try to remove this complexity with the idea to be able to verify a block without the need of having all the state. So the big idea is just to have a witness of the state at that moment. And if you have this proof and this witness, you can validate that the transaction from one state to the another one is correct.
00:18:06.902 - 00:18:19.270, Speaker B: So mainly the good part of this is that we can remove all the state of Ethereum and just to have very small proof of the current state and be able to verify a block.
00:18:19.350 - 00:18:58.760, Speaker A: So you're telling me that if we create a block through this witness and through this proof, we can prove only the parts of the state that we need to prove that this block is valid and include it in the block itself. So a validator of the block will be able to look at the block in itself and it'll include this proof, so it'll be able to tell if it's valid or not. Yeah, exactly. Which means that we need to link this with. Okay, so we're starting to separate who does all of this proof production and who does the validator work.
00:19:00.570 - 00:19:32.034, Speaker B: Yeah, PBS. PBS is going to be also a very important part of the protocol because the thing that Paul just mentioned. So mainly the idea is that we are going to split the roles on the network, we are going to have proposal and block producers. So mainly the idea is that the block producer is the one that is going to create all of this to generate the weakness and is the one that is going to take this high computation. We don't have too much time.
00:19:32.072 - 00:19:32.514, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:32.632 - 00:19:45.720, Speaker B: Okay, so yeah, the idea is just to put all this computation in the block producers and the validators are going to be more or less the same. So they only need to validate this proof in a short way.
00:19:47.290 - 00:19:49.078, Speaker A: So what do we need to know?
00:19:49.244 - 00:20:26.770, Speaker B: Yeah, mainly that the hardware requirement for holding the state disappears. And that is really good. And also if we link with the blocked things, it's like, okay, we are getting more space here and we are putting block there. So more or less we are going to be the same. It's going to increase the bandwidth, but not too much, because we are going to move from practitioner Merkel trees to vertical trees that are more efficient ways to prove the state. So mainly as a validator, I think the result is going to be more or less same. It has been always a need that validators need to be running custom hardware.
00:20:26.770 - 00:20:28.920, Speaker B: So we keep on that level.
00:20:29.930 - 00:21:10.206, Speaker A: Okay, I'm going to take the dank sharding and data availability sampling. Okay. So this is going to be the last thing, and the key part that solo stakers need to know right now about this is that we do not know which are the consequences that it will have. So we cannot possibly know right now because there's not a specific implementation of the data availability sampling. So data availability sampling. What it will allow us is to remember those blobs of data that we have mentioned before. So these blobs of data will not necessarily be fully downloaded.
00:21:10.206 - 00:21:55.018, Speaker A: We'll be able to just prove a sample of this, to take a sample of this data and prove somehow that this exists and this is valid and available for download. But we do not know yet what's going to be for solo stakers because there's too many moving pieces and this is way too far away. So for the moment, for solo stakers, what it matters is the protodank sharding the existence of these data blobs, et cetera. So, to summarize very, very quickly on the topics that we have spoken MEV, it's a bug, not a feature. It's a centralizing force, and it screws up our censorship resistance for DVT. We will be able to leverage our setups to earn extra rewards for the withdrawals. Pretty self explanatory.
00:21:55.018 - 00:22:28.980, Speaker A: We'll be able to take our deposits out. Protodunk sharding. Our consensus layer will grow with these blobs of data validator anonymity, single secret layer election will save us from the MEV extractors that come behind us, and they want to get us offline to get the MEV opportunities. Statelessness is that we will have less drive requirements, but we will have more bandwidth and unsharding that we don't really know. So in 25 minutes, this is everything you needed to know about the next phase of Ethereum. Thank you very much. Thank you.
