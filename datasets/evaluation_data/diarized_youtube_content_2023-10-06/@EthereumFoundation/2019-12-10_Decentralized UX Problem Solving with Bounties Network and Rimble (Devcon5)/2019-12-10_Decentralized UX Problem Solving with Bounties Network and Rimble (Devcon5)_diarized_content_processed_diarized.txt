00:00:16.730 - 00:00:55.662, Speaker A: So thank you for coming. My name is Corwin. I am the co founder and the designer of Bounty Network. We are just going to kind of introduce ourselves. We want to keep this super casual today and spend as little time with us talking as possible so that we can give time to questions and get started on workshop activities, which are, by the way, going to last until next Monday. The contest will be open until next Monday. Get started on them today, let you guys ask some questions and then give you guys help with any setup or anything if you need.
00:00:55.662 - 00:02:27.750, Speaker A: Yeah. So just to talk a little bit about Bonti's network. Bonti's network is a platform that allows individuals to create projects and incentivize other individuals to complete those projects and get paid in cryptocurrency. We use these sort of incentive mechanisms for a variety of experiments and likely been trending towards working with organizations and community type structures to get those community leaders to incentivize their members to complete tasks, projects to provide feedback to each other in a sort of decentralized manner in a sort of done for Defcon this year. Sorry, could you project a little bit more? Yes, sorry. One of the things that we've done for Devcon this year is actually set up bounty network specifically for this Devcon. So if you go to Japan bouncies Network, you will be able to our bounty explorer, which is dedicated to dedicated wood as a conference specifically, there are already a ton of bounties up that anybody is welcome to complete and earn some e die for doing certain tasks around the conference.
00:02:27.750 - 00:02:46.560, Speaker A: But this is also where we will be posting the bounties that we've created for this workshop in particular. And here you can just find information about myself, and I'll let Zach introduce himself in the room.
00:02:46.950 - 00:03:55.634, Speaker B: Hi, everybody, I'm Zach Talman. I'm the project manager for Rimble. Rimble is an open source library of react components, design patterns, and Ux guides to help you make dapps that everyone can use. The bounty network and Rimble are kicking off this little experiment in decentralized problem solving today with the goal of uncovering new UX patterns that might help improve Dapp usability. Rimble is a research driven offering, and we are constantly researching UX problems that are common among dapps, and prototyping and testing potential solutions with users. And in doing that, we've uncovered a number of challenges that people in this room might be familiar with. But we want to bring a community around to coalesce around creative solutions.
00:03:55.634 - 00:04:38.726, Speaker B: And so we're partnering with Bounty's team on this initiative to incentivize this collaborative generation of these creative and effective UX solutions in response to these bounties. So Corwin's going to talk a little bit about the bounties themselves and then we'll get into the meat kind of substance of the prompt. Like Corwin said, we are going to try to keep this pretty casual and pretty quick because we want you guys to start talking about this. People in this room are going to do the interesting work here between now and now and Monday. So we want to make ourselves available for questions, but also just have you.
00:04:38.748 - 00:04:42.774, Speaker A: Guys start to talk to each other about potential ideas as well.
00:04:42.972 - 00:04:46.390, Speaker B: So Ford's going to talk about kind of the structure, a little bit of the bounties.
00:04:47.870 - 00:05:25.806, Speaker A: So for this workshop, we have four bounties that we've created for you guys to sort of take on. Just out of curiosity, who in this room has an interest or experience currently works as. Couldn't hear it because the door is open. What? Couldn't hear it because the door was open. I'll say it again. Come on in. All right, so we have four bounties that we've created for this workshop, and they're centered around design and Ux and front end and usability for dapps.
00:05:25.806 - 00:06:11.326, Speaker A: Can I get just a brief show of hands of who work in any of those areas or who has a keen interest in any of those areas? Cool, great. So what we want to do as we introduce these bounties is encourage. You aren't extremely technical. You don't have a background in design, background in Ux. I would encourage you all to still attempt to submit to these bounties. We're kind of structuring them so that you are being incentivized to participate. And then there's larger incentives for people who want to go that step further, to kind of go above and beyond in their submission.
00:06:11.326 - 00:07:03.060, Speaker A: So what I want to do is talk about the submission requirements and the evaluation criteria as we introduce each of these bounties. So, like Zach said, each of these bounties comes out of research that rimble has done around usability problems that have been identified in DAPs, common usability problems. And so we've created a prompt for four of these usability issues that we've identified. And the first of these is onboarding new DAP users. So the submission requirements. And I'll just kind of go through this briefly and then show you what the other bounties are. Because the submission requirements and evaluation criteria for each of these bounties is going to be fairly similar.
00:07:03.060 - 00:08:11.686, Speaker A: Like I said before, we want as many people to be able to participate as possible. So the minimum requirements for a submission to each of these bounties is going to be a clearly articulated and written explanation of your solution and the pain points that it attempts to solve from the prompt, and if possible, some sort of visual accompaniment to that written explanation to sort of help you explain what your solution is and how you came to it. Ideal submissions would include design files illustrating user flows, prototypes, working demos, links to source code. Use of the rimble component library is encouraged. Those who are a little bit more technical and are curious or willing to experiment with that. It's really easy to get set up and we have the guys up here that can help with you for evaluation criteria. This is how we're going to be evaluating each of the submissions to these bounties.
00:08:11.686 - 00:09:39.634, Speaker A: I won't read through all of them there because they're available to you, but essentially, does your solution provide a new and improved approach to these common usability problems? Because of that, can we expect users to be able to accomplish the tasks they need to accomplish? Can the pattern be applied to a wide range of contexts? Not all DApps share the same usability concerns, but if you can come up with that can be applied to more than one in more than one context, then that's always a plus. Implementation of fidelity. So again, we want everyone to be able to participate. So technical implementations and high fidelity submissions are not a requirement. You can keep things simple, you can keep your submissions limited to just expressions of ideas that you thought through, but you get bonus points if your submission is particularly complete and well thought through and thorough, and has deliverables that are attached to that submission. That kind of show off what you have thought of and what you built. And then the remaining criteria are going to be accessibility and error handling.
00:09:39.634 - 00:10:32.470, Speaker A: So is your prior team accessible and error handling? Do they consider different states that a user might encounter when they come into contact with these patterns? These are more directed towards the more minded folks in the group. So just to go through each of the prompts really quickly. So the first one is going to be about onboarding new DAP users. The second is going to be about smart contract interaction, third is going to be about transaction states, and the fourth is going to be about ease address. I'll let that kind of expand upon what each of those bounties are, what the prompts are, and how they sort of came to be, how the problems came about.
00:10:32.620 - 00:12:03.300, Speaker B: We tried to put a pretty good amount of context into the text of the bounties themselves. So I'd encourage everyone, if you can, to open them up and read through. I'm not going to go through read through these line by line in the interest of time, but could be a helpful reference. So the first one here is onboarding new DAP users. Rimble's research has told us something that probably everyone in this room knows very well, that is really hard for someone new to Ethereum to use an app. So the typical onboarding workflow has tons of pitfalls and areas for potential failure and abandonment, frustration, confusion. So the process usually at a high level, including something like connecting to a wallet, signing in to a wallet, adding funds, connecting the wallet to the DAP, and then proceeding to try to accomplish whatever they were originally attempting to do is a process that we have seen lots of attempted solutions, some more successful than others, but we think we'd all agree that this is a major pain point and one that is certainly confirmed as a challenge through Rimble's research.
00:12:03.300 - 00:13:33.940, Speaker B: Unfortunately for us, none of these are there's no one size fits all kind of global onboarding solution, and each application brings its own context and its own user goals that it's trying to fulfill, and it's really having its own. Each application has its own conversation with the user, and this is where I plug my friend Ryan's workshop, I think on Thursday on conversational design, later on this week. So the challenge here is to create a reusable pattern or set of patterns to improve upon some aspect of the onboarding workflow. This could be a model of the entire onboarding process, or just a novel approach to some portion of it. So we have a laundry list of relevant scenarios that could be accounted for here. Checking for web3, cable browser, checking for a connected wallet, and different scenarios involved there. Checking for specific network, signing a wallet message, funding the wallet and funding the wallet in different ways.
00:13:33.940 - 00:14:12.350, Speaker B: Getting the balance of an ETH address, displaying current ETH price or current gas price. I just want to reiterate, we aren't saying this prompt is to create a perfect end to end onboarding flow. If you have that, that would be an amazing submission to this bounty. But improving in a novel way on any aspect or angle on that workflow is going to be valuable, and collectively we're all doing that. We think that there's a tremendous opportunity here.
00:14:12.500 - 00:14:48.200, Speaker A: There's also an opportunity for, if you have friends in the room or if you have any interest in collaborating, to sort of take these prompts piecemeal and sort of say, I'm interested in this part of the process, this person is interested in this part of the process. Is there an opportunity for collaborated on a solution in an attempt to submit something that's a little bit more high caliber? Because there are going to be prizes that are larger than just the payout that you're going to receive for your submission being accepted, and I'll go over that at the end.
00:14:50.030 - 00:16:31.500, Speaker B: The second prompt is on smart contract interactions. So on. Chain interactions with smart contracts typically introduce some levels of complexity that are greater than just a basic wallet to wallet transaction experience for users and product teams and users end users would all collectively benefit from having a set of consistent patterns for a lot of that common functionality associated with that process. Things that we've seen come up in our research there are estimating gas costs, dealing with transaction time, but we've also looked at more complex end to end workflows, like opening CDP. So, similarly to the previous prompt, if you have a novel approach to any one aspect to smart contract interaction, user experience, whether that's just one of those types, individual functionalities such as estimated gas price, or a new approach to an entire workflow, opening a CDP, an ERC 20 token swap, all of those would be fantastic submission ideas for this prompt. So again, we've kind of included a little bit of a laundry list of possible ideas. But these aren't necessarily constraints, just a place to get started.
00:16:31.500 - 00:16:37.580, Speaker B: The third process on transaction space.
00:16:40.270 - 00:16:40.646, Speaker A: This.
00:16:40.688 - 00:17:51.714, Speaker B: Is another one that has come up over and over again in our user research that everyone, nearly everyone we've talked to, has expressed concern or lack of confidence around transactions. They're permanent, they're scary, they involve your money. And that creates a lot of tension and nervousness and anxiety among users. If you're in this room, you probably know to look at ether scan or metamask to understand more about a transaction. But a lot of users who aren't as familiar don't know to do that. So how can we create a set of patterns that builders can use to provide a more informative experience that alleviates anxiety during the transaction process? Help people understand more about what is happening without overloading them with information and accounting for different contexts, some where more.
00:17:51.752 - 00:17:54.580, Speaker A: Information is needed, somewhere less information is needed.
00:17:56.470 - 00:19:15.040, Speaker B: So here we reference some potential we can get into it. But some of those scenarios might be a user rejecting a transaction, or a transaction getting rejected for for low gas transaction stuck pending in the Mem pool due to low gas resubmitting a transaction. So there's a lot of these kind of transaction related scenarios that are severe pitfalls for the uninitiated user and really strong opportunities here. And then the last prompt we have is around wallet exploration. Wallet address exploration. We recently performed an inventory of patterns, UI patterns among a pretty wide number range of DAPps for displaying information associated with an Ethereum address in the DAP. And we got this just huge sprawling variance in height of information.
00:19:15.040 - 00:20:53.200, Speaker B: Some were very simple displays of just an address and a balance, and some were these rich displays of information, including tokens and other assets and transaction histories and currency conversion. Lots and lots and lots of information. Again, each DAP has its own context and its own needs, and these are all potentially very valid approaches. But we would all benefit, I think, from more consistent patterns for displaying information associated with the wallet address in a DAP. And how can we start to create some of those models that recognizing each DAP has its own context, but can we create elements that are recognizable to users and start to build some more of that confidence? So things we possible scenarios to account for here might be wallet balance, recent transactions I mentioned tokens, currency conversion to fiat, adding funds through an onramp, those sorts of things. So again, we wanted to keep this short and put a lot of this into the bounties themselves because really we don't see this moment as what's important. What we see where the value we see coming is in the work that hopefully you guys are going to do over the next week.
00:20:53.200 - 00:21:17.860, Speaker B: And we are here to answer questions now we're going to be around to answer questions this week. Please feel free to put comments on the bounties themselves. We'll be keeping an eye on those on Twitter, really. Wherever you can reach us, we will be here to answer.
00:21:18.730 - 00:22:04.530, Speaker A: Yeah, so just a few more housekeeping things before we open it up to any questions that you guys might have. So some requirements. Well, actually, let me talk about the prizes first. So I've gone through some of the evaluation criteria for how we're going to be judging the submissions that anybody chooses to submit with their boundary fulfillment. For any of these prompts, you're welcome to do one, you're welcome to do all of them. But basically, based on that evaluation criteria, your submission will either be accepted or it won't. If it is accepted, you will receive the amount that is payout for the value, which is around five dollars, zero point three feet.
00:22:04.530 - 00:23:39.522, Speaker A: And this is just meeting, having your submission be accepted, that meets the minimum requirements again. So this is submissions that meet some of the criteria will likely be accepted you don't need to hit check every single box because there are some of these evaluation criteria that are more geared towards the technical folks in the room, but there's kind of a second tier of prizes that we want to give out for exceptional submissions. So these are going to be submissions that meet most, if not all of the evaluation criteria, sort of submissions that we see go above and beyond to provide demos, prototypes, examples of things that are maybe particularly innovative, particularly thoughtful, particularly thorough. And so for each prompt, what's going to happen is there's going to be a first prize winner and a second prize winner. The first prize is going to receive zero point 54 E, and that's equivalent to $100 at the time of the activation of this bounty. And the second prize is going to receive zero point 27 E, which is equivalent to $50 us. So we just really want to encourage, we have that lower tier incentive because we want to encourage everyone to participate, earn some ETH, have fun, talk to your colleagues about solutions that you have, ideas that you have.
00:23:39.522 - 00:24:30.020, Speaker A: But then we also want to incentivize people that want to take that step further and really go deep and explore solutions to some of these really common feasibility problems that we've identified. So some of the things you're going to need to participate are going to be a wallet, and you're going to need to set up an account. Sign up for an account on Bounty's network the sign up process for an account on Bounty's network is really straightforward. You essentially just link your wallet, provide a minimum amount of information. It's really kind of up to you what information you want to provide. And once you've done that, you are free to submit to any of these bounties once your submission is ready. And again, there's a comment section on each of the bounties where you're welcome to ask questions.
00:24:30.020 - 00:24:34.782, Speaker A: I will be receiving those, since I was the one who created the bounties.
00:24:34.926 - 00:24:36.086, Speaker B: But we're going to be sort of.
00:24:36.108 - 00:25:27.702, Speaker A: Collectively addressing each of those questions. And those conversations can start on bounties, or you can get in touch with us via Twitter or what have you, and we will get back to you. We'll sort of be in conversation throughout the duration of the bounty active timeline, which again is until next Monday. Also, we also encourage people to comment on other people's submissions. If you see someone submit something, because all of the submissions are going to be visible to everyone that's participating in this workshop. If you see someone submitting some solution, tell them what you think about it. Tell them asking questions, ask them.
00:25:27.702 - 00:26:16.226, Speaker A: Have you thought about this? Because that really kind of opens doors and opportunities for collaboration, which is really what Bounty network is all about. Our focus is on community. Our focus is on collaboration and sort of incentivizing that and encouraging that and seeing which ways we can use those mechanisms. So please be as active as you can be and don't hold back. So, yeah, that's it. Any questions, feel free to ask. And as with the remaining time, if you want to stick around and start doing things like signing up for your account on Bounty's network, reading the prompts, you are perfectly welcome to do that, and we'll be around to help you do that.
00:26:16.226 - 00:26:54.640, Speaker A: If you have any questions around, setting up a wallet, setting up an account, and then we will also be around to answer questions about the specific prompt. But the prompts will be active for the next week and you're welcome to work on them throughout the week. And once you reach the deadline, we will be accepting the submission. You'll be receiving your piece instantaneously once your submission is accepted, and then we'll be contacting the first place and second place winners to receive those higher tier prizes for those acceptable submissions. Any questions?
00:26:55.970 - 00:27:01.620, Speaker C: What's the percentage of bounces that never gets even submitted to?
00:27:02.310 - 00:27:04.670, Speaker B: Doesn't even get one submitted submission.
00:27:04.750 - 00:27:05.380, Speaker C: Yes.
00:27:06.330 - 00:27:10.678, Speaker A: Don't know that off the top of my head, but I can get back.
00:27:10.684 - 00:27:14.710, Speaker C: To you on that wall park again ballpark.
00:27:17.130 - 00:28:12.294, Speaker A: Very few. Very few. A lot of the submissions, a lot of the bounces that we create or that get created on Bounty's network are in partnership with individuals or partnership with organizations. And so because we've kind of created that ground for experimenting, since a lot of the bounties come out of partnerships or events or conferences or efforts like that, most of them see activity. We don't see a lot of people at this point in time. Since bounty network is very young and still in a very much an experimental stage, we don't see a lot of people creating bounties just on their own. So you don't see a lot of people saying, hey, I'll pay you zero point whatever ETH to bring me pizza.
00:28:12.294 - 00:28:18.090, Speaker A: Is that actually happening? Although you could do that very easily.
00:28:22.770 - 00:28:49.720, Speaker D: Hi, my name is Jody Rich. We run a conference in New York in February, all about NFTS developers, and we'd love to talk to you about your great work on boundaries for our audience. My question, and maybe it's for the room, is, is $5 enough to get an engineer to actually make a submission and it's $50 and $100, a big enough price.
00:28:52.170 - 00:28:53.346, Speaker C: Designer.
00:28:53.538 - 00:28:55.000, Speaker A: What do you people think?
00:28:55.530 - 00:29:00.040, Speaker C: No, that was my second question.
00:29:02.330 - 00:29:10.314, Speaker A: The reason we started off with a lower submission payout for individual submissions is.
00:29:10.432 - 00:29:11.466, Speaker B: A couple of reasons.
00:29:11.578 - 00:30:31.318, Speaker A: One is because the minimum sort of requirement for a submission is basically writing a paragraph about what you think of the potential solution for something, maybe including a sketch of what that looks like, something very low fidelity. And so for those less technical minded people, we want to be able to reward them with something. But we also recognize that for the people that are going to be spending more time and more effort in their submissions, that's where the higher tier award comes in. But this is actually a really great point because this is a problem that exists in the world of contest style freelancing, I guess, is what you could call it, where you have a lot of people working who are not guaranteed to receive payments or anything. This is something that is huge problem on platforms that you see like fiver platforms that you see like upwork things like 99 design where there's hundreds of people submitting their work, hundreds of people spending hours doing these things and they're not getting compensated. That's something that we really care about. It's something that we don't have a solution for right now.
00:30:31.318 - 00:31:38.106, Speaker A: It's something that we want to work towards a solution for. So I just want to make sure to say that. I also want to say that we are the type of platform and organization that is happy to have this conversation. And if you in the room feel like you want to discuss openly about what a more reasonable payout would be for those just initial submissions and as well as what those prizes might be for those exceptional submissions, let's talk about it. And we're totally willing to increase those, change those. We're also willing to extend a deadline. If you guys feel like the time that's given is not enough, I will say one thing that we did talk about was maybe having changing the prize to be a range and taking into account the time and effort that has gone into the submission and paying the first prize amount, increasing the first prize amount to account for those kinds of things.
00:31:38.106 - 00:32:05.540, Speaker A: So let's definitely have those conversations. We're totally open to it. We don't want anyone to feel like their work, their hard work has gone unrewarded. And this is a problem that exists across all sorts of platforms that are sort of solved this distributed, remote, centralized work problem space. And that's a conversation that we're interested in continuing to have.
00:32:08.650 - 00:32:14.886, Speaker C: Pick the vote. Have the room vote on the question I answered alone. But let's see what the others say as well.
00:32:15.068 - 00:32:19.180, Speaker D: Yeah. Who thinks that $5 is enough? Anyone?
00:32:20.270 - 00:32:22.762, Speaker A: So I think a better question than five.
00:32:22.816 - 00:32:24.582, Speaker B: Is $5 enough for submission?
00:32:24.646 - 00:32:41.114, Speaker A: Because ultimately my submission would be a paragraph that's kind of crappy two minutes sketch, which I think that's fair. Do you think it would be reasonable to maybe introduce additional tiers with additional criteria? Is that more reasonable?
00:32:41.242 - 00:32:47.860, Speaker B: I think the submission reward could be zero and it would be still okay.
00:32:49.270 - 00:32:52.738, Speaker A: The problem for me is like, well, I work as a designer, I know my hourly rate.
00:32:52.824 - 00:33:04.678, Speaker B: I mentioned the winning solution should include demos and prototypes and explanation of error states. And that's many hours. And the best case scenario of $100.
00:33:04.764 - 00:33:07.720, Speaker A: Doesn'T cover almost like a single hour.
00:33:08.890 - 00:33:10.506, Speaker B: And on top of that, there is.
00:33:10.528 - 00:33:12.650, Speaker A: A risk that I will not even get that right.
00:33:12.720 - 00:33:15.450, Speaker B: So I'm looking that into hours times.
00:33:15.520 - 00:34:21.470, Speaker A: Risk multiplier, and that equals no. Okay, yeah, that's totally fair. One thing, we had 111 people sign up for this workshop, which obviously there's not 111 people in this room, which is good, which is great. And be a little bit more flexible with this. So, no, I hear you, and I agree with you as a designer. I agree with you as a designer, as we attempt to solve problems specifically for spaces like design, and where those kinds of projects and workflows and careers, where do those fit into platforms like this, and how do you address the problems that are innate to those spaces? Again, you want to make sure that it's fair. Also, one thing we're considering, and this is not an excuse, but one thing we are considering is that we are at the bottom of a bear market and offering half as ETH.
00:34:21.470 - 00:34:50.906, Speaker A: There's that potential. Who says that they know anything about progress? Right? But, yeah. So let's have that conversation. Let's change the reward amount. I want everyone who participates to feel like it's fair and to feel like that they're not just doing this for nothing, because ultimately, that's how everyone feels that no one's going to do it. Right.
00:34:51.008 - 00:36:40.326, Speaker B: One of the challenges with making the criteria somewhat burdensome is that when we're talking about the challenges with user experience in some of these areas, issues like error states are where a lot of those user failures are happening. And so that was our rationale for elevating that top level of evaluation criteria. Normally, that would probably be something as an app, something like an afterthought in a competition like model. But just in the research that we've done. That's where we see a lot of users failing, and so we don't want that to be left behind in some of these solutions. So I guess there's a little bit of an inherent tension in doing that, but not necessarily. But how do we make that worthwhile? And so maybe the answer is to make some of those evaluation criteria a little bit more flexible so that when we say how is it handling errors, maybe we remove that from the critical acceptance criteria but introduce it more as part of the prompt to recognize that that's part of the critical problems that we're solving.
00:36:40.326 - 00:36:44.960, Speaker B: So not necessarily saying you have to have comprehensive error state coverage in this.
00:36:46.770 - 00:37:22.186, Speaker D: Can I change the topic just for a minute? Ask your questions. I understand the problem that you're trying to solve with Rimble is to bring in non blockchain users and to try and make the experience much easier for them. I've just tried to use drimble app demo on my phone and it says your browser doesn't support our blockchain features. And I'm just wondering why you assume that I have to have a wallet to be able to use your tools. You must have put a lot of thought into that. Why do I have to have a.
00:37:22.208 - 00:37:24.140, Speaker A: Wallet to use your tool?
00:37:29.070 - 00:37:54.820, Speaker B: You don't have to use that is a demo of wallet specific components featured in ripple. That's not ripple, public facing website or documentation or anything like that. The tool is a component library itself for developers. It's meant for people.
00:37:56.470 - 00:38:08.570, Speaker D: No, but I think one of the big mistakes we make as a community is we assume that people A, understand what a wallet is and B, that they want to have a wallet. And I think that's a huge mistake.
00:38:10.670 - 00:38:13.434, Speaker B: Absolutely. We completely agree.
00:38:13.552 - 00:38:15.066, Speaker D: We completely agree with you.
00:38:15.168 - 00:38:30.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're at the point, at this point in time, what can we practically right now, what can we implement that's not what we already have, which is wallets. And the research.
00:38:32.610 - 00:38:42.340, Speaker B: We have a UX guide on connecting to a wallet that I think better articulates our recommendations there.
00:38:44.870 - 00:39:11.750, Speaker A: I also want to say recently bounty network has transaction that allows for new users who haven't gone through the process of acquiring to still be able to fulfill a bounty. And basically what we do is we subsidize the gas fees for those users. And so that's an example of like a first step. Right?
00:39:11.840 - 00:39:12.750, Speaker B: That's really cool.
00:39:12.820 - 00:39:41.958, Speaker A: Exactly. And that's like something that we're looking to expand and to continue to experiment with is how can we use mechanisms like that? Because obviously there is a cost to the network. In the future, hopefully people will recognize the benefits outweigh the cost of things like gas and whatnot. But until then, there are things like metatransactions that we can use to sort of offload some of that, take some of that pressure off or use a.
00:39:41.964 - 00:39:44.150, Speaker D: Side chain, or use a side chain.
00:39:46.170 - 00:39:49.480, Speaker A: That's one thing we're talking about as well.
00:39:54.350 - 00:40:09.834, Speaker E: On the engineering perspective, because when you make a question for a broader answer and you have a lot of contributions to that, you can have a lot of overlapper on work somehow.
00:40:09.962 - 00:40:11.294, Speaker A: I think it's a very hard thing.
00:40:11.332 - 00:40:59.338, Speaker E: To do, but if somehow you can make the questions more specific and go fill in them with time instead of having a few options with a broad scope, that would really take a lot of times, like there could be like 20 or even 100 of tasks that are going to be completed and I don't need to work on them anymore. So in a few minutes or more than a few hours, I can make contribution that I am very sure it's going to be a concise and very good usage contribution for what your guys are asking. It's much more secure for me to contribute with a specific subject than try to win a prize for a very broader subject.
00:40:59.434 - 00:41:34.874, Speaker A: Sure. So breaking out each of the prompts into more specific bounties that have more limited and specific criteria just to build on this point. I think the issue is just working within the creative fields as far as bounty those types of tasks in the first place. Absolutely. So I think if you guys came to the front of the room and said, hey, guys, we're going to do this for free, everyone would be willing to do it as soon as you put a $5 value. As humans, we want consistency in our thinking, and I probably do ourselves, so $5 makes me feel attacked, all of them.
00:41:35.072 - 00:41:36.474, Speaker B: Whereas you said, hey, do it for.
00:41:36.512 - 00:42:20.460, Speaker A: Free, I'd be gung hole about it. I think everyone would be working right now instead of having these conversations. So maybe you guys have to kind of go back and look at what type of tasks are actually absolutely geared towards bounties and what absolutely doesn't really work in that. And that's like something that we're trying to figure out, right. And that's something that I want to say, first of all, that I fucking love hearing all of the feedback from you guys because it's insight into how we can evolve the product and how we can. It's affirming to hear you guys echo the same skepticism that I have towards the platform that I'm building. Right.
00:42:20.460 - 00:43:59.080, Speaker A: For things like competition style, anything, really. And how do you make that fair? Can you make it fair? How does it apply to specific skill sets? Does it work for some and not for others? These are all questions that we're attempting to ask, and that's why the founding network in particular is kind of shifting our focus to be less on a sort of competition style freelancing platform and more about engaging with communities and getting communities to incentivize their community members to participate in some sort of collective collaborative action. That sounds different than something like Fiver, which is like, pay $5 and you get a logo. That's not what we want bounty to be, and that's not the direction that bounty. And so that's where, if you have a chance, I'd love it if you guys could go on and just check out some of the projects that we've done that are more like community oriented and getting partners and communities to work with us to incentivize community members to do things that benefit the community. This exercise in particular does resemble a little bit more of that competition kind of thing. Part of that comes from the fact that we have sort of this restriction of this workshop type of event.
00:43:59.080 - 00:44:10.566, Speaker A: And so that's not necessarily. We're not necessarily the case. Yeah. So what if we just get paper and some stuff and hairstyle just drawing.
00:44:10.598 - 00:44:12.682, Speaker C: Out things, and then in an hour.
00:44:12.736 - 00:44:14.560, Speaker A: Say, okay, this is what we come up with.
00:44:14.930 - 00:44:18.414, Speaker C: Maybe that's an idea. Just get your hands dirty and do something.
00:44:18.612 - 00:44:22.858, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, you have a week to do that. Yeah. The thing for me is I don't.
00:44:22.874 - 00:44:24.890, Speaker C: Have a week because I have a very short schedule.
00:44:24.970 - 00:44:25.310, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:25.380 - 00:44:28.386, Speaker C: So I don't know if everybody here has a whole week to spend, but.
00:44:28.408 - 00:44:29.538, Speaker A: I would love to spend now an.
00:44:29.544 - 00:44:31.966, Speaker C: Hour with some people to come with greater solutions.
00:44:32.078 - 00:44:52.650, Speaker A: And, yeah, you're absolutely welcome to do that. And for the people who want to continue to engage in their conversations around these problems, I'd love to continue talking to you about that stuff. Those are problems that we're trying to solve, and they're hard, and there's no clear answers. I really appreciate everyone's feedback.
00:44:54.430 - 00:45:35.670, Speaker C: To build on what Akil said. I agree 100%, and I agree with him as well. I would do this a breakout, rather. And you're probably putting it on the wrong perspective. Like, Akil was right saying that if you put a price on it, you're making it kind of an insult. You should maybe focus on the intrinsic motivator, like give something beyond the money like credit. I don't know if you are going to put somewhere the visibility of somebody who has found the solution that is maybe for a designer that is entering the space, a better solution than $5, right.
00:45:35.670 - 00:46:09.460, Speaker C: Also in this space, we are like 200 designers, and we know all each other. It's a hyper technical space, and we know that you need to know a lot, you need to have studied a lot. So it's a very specific kind of designer that can tackle these questions that you have. So it's for specialized designers. And again, if you put a price on it, you are pricing it wrong until you put the right price on it.
00:46:11.190 - 00:46:43.120, Speaker A: Part of the goal in doing it this way was to try and get people that don't necessarily fall into that category. And so we wanted people to come and participate and to help to think about these problems with us who may be like first time DAP users or whatnot, who do run into these problems, who maybe have limited experience with Dapps and have run into these problems before and have thoughts about them that they would like to share.
00:46:44.210 - 00:46:47.022, Speaker D: Can I just add. Sorry, what's your name?
00:46:47.076 - 00:46:48.030, Speaker C: Beltran.
00:46:50.210 - 00:47:28.220, Speaker D: Cameron and I are running a conference in five months in New York. And if there are any designers who would like an incentive or bounty program that fits what you think is right, we are completely open to an experiment in February this year in New York. And so if you think we can do something that's better than $5 or $0, please tell us, because we would love to run a bounty program during nftNYC that suits what the community thinks is right.
00:47:29.470 - 00:47:29.978, Speaker C: Sure.
00:47:30.064 - 00:47:30.746, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:47:30.848 - 00:47:31.622, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:47:31.776 - 00:47:32.430, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:47:32.500 - 00:48:30.510, Speaker A: Yeah, let's chat. Cool. Well, with that, I think we'll just kind of let you guys go. If you feel like you want to stay or have any questions about the bounty in particular, bounty network in particular, feel free. And again, I want to have a place to continue this discussion for those who care to continue the discussion around things like pricing and fair rewards and things like that. So what would be the best way to do that? Anybody off the top of their heads? Some kind of slack channel or telegram group or something like that? I know everyone's in a million of those already, but all of this feedback is valuable to me, and I'm interested in hearing it and collecting it. So let's put a book free bump feed on the bonfies.
00:48:30.510 - 00:48:35.042, Speaker A: All right, I'll do that today and.
00:48:35.096 - 00:49:10.090, Speaker C: Have Stephen Pink redeem it. He wrote a book on. It's called drive, autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Those are the three drives especially for creative kind of tasks, for which he proves. Also that research proves that motivating through extrinsic motivators like money, it's wrong. You will not get the result as if you're using intrinsic motivators. Which is why I was suggesting you should look for other rewards or payout.
00:49:11.470 - 00:49:12.730, Speaker D: Could we totally.
00:49:16.350 - 00:49:58.780, Speaker A: You can join the bounties lab. So if you go to the bounties network site, actually, that would be great place to do it. So I am actually going to do what you're suggesting. I'm going to put up a bounty to continue this conversation and just have people that want to participate in the conversation. And then there's also, you have the option to join our slack, which is like a community slack that the bounty team has. And we love to engage with you about these kinds of difficult problems on there. Is there like a rimble bouncy channel or something? I can think one.
00:50:03.410 - 00:50:57.950, Speaker B: And we recognize this was a very thoughtful discussion. We hope you recognize we are kind of operating within the constraints of the conference schedule, and that drove a little bit of the structure and planning this to be a week long kind of asynchronous thing, as opposed to more of a dedicated in person session. We love to spend that time, too. And like I said before, we are going to be here. So grab one of us and we'd love to talk and encourage all of you guys to spend some time together if you are interested in participating. And we really look forward to seeing what people can come up with and appreciate everybody's participation.
00:50:58.290 - 00:51:13.360, Speaker A: Perhaps before people leave the room, you could write out the prompts on the board, and if people want to kind of boil us around the topics or collaboration later. Thank you, everyone.
