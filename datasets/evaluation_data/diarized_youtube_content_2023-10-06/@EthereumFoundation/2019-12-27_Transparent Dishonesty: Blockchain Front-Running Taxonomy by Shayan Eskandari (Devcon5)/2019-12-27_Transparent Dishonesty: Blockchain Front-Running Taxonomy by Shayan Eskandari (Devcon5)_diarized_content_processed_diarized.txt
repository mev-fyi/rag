00:00:12.730 - 00:00:26.438, Speaker A: Hi everyone. I'm Cheyenne. This is a talk about transplant dishonesty. I spent some time making this website, so I would just stop talking to myself. So I'm presenting Content Villagence and Concordia University. This lighting talk is for Shilling. This paper.
00:00:26.438 - 00:00:53.786, Speaker A: This paper was a peer reviewed first paper on blockchain front running that was published in Financial Cryptography. You can find this paper online. It's an interesting read. I'll tell you a short description here. So what is front training like? You've been hearing it all everywhere. Front running in the financial industry market has been around for more than three decades and there's no clear definition of it. And actually it took the financial crypto since 1987 to talk about front running.
00:00:53.786 - 00:01:15.346, Speaker A: And in 2012 there was more rules about what this is. And this is unethical thing to do. They thought this is a really cool thing to do and they make a lot of money out of it. So in blockchain, front running has been especially Ethereum. They've been talking a lot about this. This is a talk on Devon three in cancun they talk about front running on blockchain? Sorry, I'm talking too fast. A lot.
00:01:15.346 - 00:01:41.354, Speaker A: I'm going to say here, there was like a lot of things on Bancor that will attack with front running. A lot of projects consider front running an attack and they start talking about it early on. This is a great paper, flashboys 2.0 by Field Iron that might prepare front run. This paper. So I'm impaired. And also in the recent Fairwin Ponzi scheme or Fair scheme, that front running was a big issue.
00:01:41.354 - 00:02:12.840, Speaker A: And Daniel Luca, one of our colleagues, actually started found this bug and started talking about it. So to have the same base, I define front running as benefiting from acting on early access to information. And this benefiting means even DDoSing, the system. Like anything that you benefit as an attacker. Attacker could be just doing this for fun. And also the early means in Ethereum, all the nodes have early access to this information called Memphis. Like just a transaction that was sent.
00:02:12.840 - 00:02:38.990, Speaker A: And now are all front ending attacks the same? Like we just say this is a front running attack, but we don't know what that means exactly. You spend pages on talking about what attack you're talking about. So let's talk about some examples. So I go by one. One. But let's say Alice wants to send a transaction to do something on Ethereum. So in this case, Alice wants to send a transaction to buy a domain name, let's say ENS.
00:02:38.990 - 00:02:57.598, Speaker A: And everyone can see that transaction and get that domain before her. So just have a way to talk about this. We don't really care if Alice transaction gets accepted after yours. You just want to get your transaction before that. So we call this displacement attack. Displacement front running attack. So we can displace that transaction.
00:02:57.598 - 00:03:21.366, Speaker A: There is some other one. So Alice wants to trade on a decentral exchange. What you want to do as an attacker, you want to sandwich her trade or get your trade before her trade. So in this case you care about Alice's transaction, you want to just run before that. So in this case we call it insertion from lending attack. So insert your transaction right before that. The other one like Alice wants to buy a lottery ticket.
00:03:21.366 - 00:03:57.510, Speaker A: If you know a formal 3D that was a whole big lottery on ethereum going on. So you have a lottery ticket but you want to prevent her from buying the ticket. So in this case you want to run your transaction and prevent her or anyone else from running a transaction. So we call it suppression attack or on some blogs it's called block stopping attack. There is some other attacks like more details. Alice wants to cancel her transaction on decentralized exchange to send the transaction to cancel. So you want to fill the order before it is cancelled and get profit from that.
00:03:57.510 - 00:04:22.286, Speaker A: So you don't care about Alice's transaction. So it would be a displacement attack. But the transaction you're sending is field. So it's different than cancel. So it's different one. So it's asymmetric it's asymmetric it's a different transaction. So in this paper we come up with this table is the taxonomy fronthearting attacks that you can explain any kind of attacks with two or three words instead of explaining your whole time.
00:04:22.286 - 00:04:44.678, Speaker A: We have for more on this and we try to have it some more best practices. So on the paper we go also on the team mitigation leaks of mind other things. There's no time to talk about this but there is a lot that we talk. Please read this paper. I would like to discuss this on Twitter or any other place. And Cheyenne Es is my website. You can get my Twitter, their email or any other thing.
00:04:44.678 - 00:04:48.660, Speaker A: And concept. Vision is who I work with right now. Thanks.
