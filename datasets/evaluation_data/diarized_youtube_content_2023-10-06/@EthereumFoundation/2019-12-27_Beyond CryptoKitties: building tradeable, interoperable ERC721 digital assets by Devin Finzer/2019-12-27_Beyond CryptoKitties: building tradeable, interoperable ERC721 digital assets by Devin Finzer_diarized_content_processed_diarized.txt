00:00:12.810 - 00:00:21.646, Speaker A: It was intended to be sort of a workshop. So if anyone wants to at the like, sort of halfway through, we'll be doing some coding if anyone wants to.
00:00:21.828 - 00:00:24.854, Speaker B: Take out their laptop and try some stuff out.
00:00:25.012 - 00:01:10.306, Speaker A: If not, no. So the workshop overview, the introduction is just a little bit of background on NFTs for those of you who aren't as familiar with them, a little bit of background on OpenSea. And then the second part of the presentation will be the development goal of deploying a Tradable NFT conference ticket with the sub goals of implementing a simple ERC 721 contract, viewing the tickets on a marketplace, putting them on sale, and then maybe as a take home task programmatically, selling the tickets using something like that.
00:01:10.328 - 00:01:11.570, Speaker B: Openc SDK.
00:01:13.750 - 00:01:35.334, Speaker A: So how many of you are familiar with ERC 721? Okay, so it's the majority of the room. So this is probably just a refresher, but ERC 20 represents what are called fungible assets. So currencies and ERC 721 was designed.
00:01:35.382 - 00:01:42.670, Speaker B: To represent unique or non fungible digital assets. So each one was associated with a.
00:01:42.740 - 00:02:03.698, Speaker A: Unique identifier and the space of one of the reasons we're excited about non fungible assets is we actually think that the number of currencies that individuals will use on a day to day basis is limited to maybe stable coins, maybe in game currencies, things like this. But the number of digital assets that.
00:02:03.704 - 00:02:14.054, Speaker B: We already use on a day to day basis is very wide. So things like game items, things like domain names, things like event tickets. And then when you start connecting these.
00:02:14.092 - 00:02:17.446, Speaker A: Digital assets to the real world, you.
00:02:17.468 - 00:02:23.260, Speaker B: Have things like real estate or physical items as well that could be represented using this standard.
00:02:25.710 - 00:03:01.894, Speaker A: So, a little bit of history of ERC 721. So in 2017, has anyone heard of CryptoPunks? Okay, so most people. So Crypto Punks was sort of the first non fungible asset on Ethereum. There were non fungible assets using Bitcoin counterparties. It was sort of the first one that was the idea of a crypto collectible on Ethereum, but there was no standard around it. And what CryptoKitties did was, number one, they built a game around these assets, but they also pioneered the ERC 721.
00:03:01.932 - 00:03:09.362, Speaker B: Standard, which was sort of refined by the Ethereum community such that it could be leveraged by other projects.
00:03:09.506 - 00:03:14.282, Speaker A: So one of those early projects was a project called Decentraland, which represented their.
00:03:14.336 - 00:03:17.642, Speaker B: Virtual land using the ERC 721 standard.
00:03:17.696 - 00:03:28.862, Speaker A: That was in late 2017. In early 2018, we sort of had a miniature craze around non fungible tokens that was a lot more isolated to.
00:03:28.996 - 00:03:35.986, Speaker B: The early adopter, tech enthusiasts relative to the craze that we saw around ICOs and ERT 20s.
00:03:36.088 - 00:03:45.666, Speaker A: But there were a lot of CryptoKitty clones like crypto bots, crypto fighters. And there were also these games called Hot Potato games, which were kind of.
00:03:45.688 - 00:03:50.918, Speaker B: These games where you would buy a collectible with the intention of selling it at a higher price.
00:03:51.004 - 00:03:52.694, Speaker A: So it was kind of this even.
00:03:52.732 - 00:04:00.140, Speaker B: More experimental period than we're going through right now with a lot of Scammy projects as well.
00:04:00.830 - 00:04:18.894, Speaker A: In mid 2018, we started seeing higher quality projects enter the space. So the two right there, there were a lot are Gods Unchained, which is a trading card game that used ERC 721 to represent their assets. And then MLB Crypto, which was actually.
00:04:18.932 - 00:04:22.270, Speaker B: An officially licensed game from the MLB.
00:04:23.170 - 00:05:09.486, Speaker A: That have these crypto collectibles associated with them. And that brings us to 2019, where actually it's less of a well known space in the crypto year, but there's actually quite a lot of activity happening in the NFT space right now. So Formula One recently auctioned off some cars using our marketplace. Actually, there's a couple of Japanese games that are becoming really popular. There's a space game that is kind of like Eve Online, if anyone's played that. And then there are starting to be.
00:05:09.668 - 00:05:12.726, Speaker B: Assets that are not in just collectibles and gaming.
00:05:12.778 - 00:05:17.394, Speaker A: So ENS is one of those that is using the ERC 721 standard to.
00:05:17.432 - 00:05:20.930, Speaker B: Allow their names to be tradable.
00:05:22.630 - 00:05:41.450, Speaker A: So one question one might ask is why is gaming kind of the leader here? So why is this an interesting fit for gaming? Number one, I think gaming is often like a digital sort of a playground for new technology. We saw this with the mobile phone.
00:05:41.600 - 00:05:43.450, Speaker B: We saw this with the early internet.
00:05:43.790 - 00:05:52.014, Speaker A: But the shift in gaming that folks are excited about is this idea that as a game developer, you sort of.
00:05:52.052 - 00:05:54.730, Speaker B: Manage every piece of your economy.
00:05:54.890 - 00:06:33.186, Speaker A: You manage the supply of your items. You usually don't allow other items to be imported into your game. There's nothing really exported from the game. It's sort of this highly controlled, isolationist economy. And what's exciting is that with blockchains and digital ownership, you could have an open economy where you could export things from the game, you could trade them on open marketplaces, you could do all these interesting things. And so this is kind of the shift that people are excited about in the gaming community. So a little background on OpenSea.
00:06:33.186 - 00:06:59.806, Speaker A: So OpenSea is a marketplace for all of these items. So starting with ERC 721, but we recently did add support for a new standard called 1155. We have around 700,000 monthly volume on the lower side of decentralized exchanges. But this is volume that people this is actual unique digital assets that are being traded.
00:06:59.838 - 00:07:04.340, Speaker B: It's not just tokens, which there is a lot of wash trading for.
00:07:04.710 - 00:07:17.222, Speaker A: We also provide an API. This is more of a convenience for wallets that are trying to show ERC 721 items. So this is used by Coinbase Wallet, Trustwallet, Opera and maybe 20 other different.
00:07:17.276 - 00:07:19.110, Speaker B: Wallets all use our API.
00:07:19.850 - 00:07:54.702, Speaker A: And then we partner with a lot of games to build customize white labeled marketplaces. So this is kind of what Openc looks like the moment you have an ERC 721 item. You can put it on sale. Kind of like Ebay trades are wallet to wallet, so they never leave your account, they're never escrowed. And we also provide a lot of the functionality that ebay provides for digital assets. So this is the Formula One car. You can see it was actually last sold for 415 Ether.
00:07:54.702 - 00:07:57.266, Speaker A: I think this is a record sale.
00:07:57.458 - 00:07:59.014, Speaker B: In the NFT community.
00:07:59.212 - 00:08:03.382, Speaker A: And basically we provide an interface for.
00:08:03.436 - 00:08:07.350, Speaker B: Allowing people to do ebay style auctions for these items.
00:08:09.870 - 00:08:37.054, Speaker A: So if you were to build your own marketplace on OpenSea, essentially what you get out of the box is all of the functionality that's built into the OpenSea website. Every single OpenSea feature. You can customize it. And actually, I'll talk about some of these other features. So this is what it looks like for this game, crypto Space Commanders. You have this browsable view of your items.
00:08:37.182 - 00:08:43.730, Speaker B: You can add rich metadata to them to kind of control how they're displayed on the marketplace.
00:08:45.270 - 00:08:52.806, Speaker A: And then the most important element of this model is that we allow the developer of an NFT to take a.
00:08:52.828 - 00:08:55.906, Speaker B: Cut of every secondary sale on their marketplace.
00:08:56.018 - 00:09:11.822, Speaker A: So our model right now is transaction fee based. That might change in the future, but we think that there should be an incentive for developers to promote their marketplace. We also provide a toolkit for which.
00:09:11.876 - 00:09:13.758, Speaker B: We'Ll talk a little bit about in.
00:09:13.764 - 00:09:18.490, Speaker A: The workshop piece for programmatically creating marketplaces.
00:09:18.650 - 00:09:21.422, Speaker B: So this is a marketplace created by.
00:09:21.556 - 00:09:30.014, Speaker A: Ethereum, which is a trading card game. And you can see that the marketplace that they've created and the OpenSea marketplace.
00:09:30.062 - 00:09:32.686, Speaker B: Are actually synchronized such that every sale.
00:09:32.798 - 00:09:35.006, Speaker A: Or every auction that happens on their.
00:09:35.048 - 00:09:37.698, Speaker B: Marketplace also happens on OpenSea.
00:09:37.714 - 00:09:47.330, Speaker A: It shares the same contracts and the same order books. So a couple examples of interesting NFT.
00:09:47.410 - 00:09:49.178, Speaker B: Projects to kind of make some of.
00:09:49.184 - 00:10:16.114, Speaker A: This a little more concrete. So this is a project called Crypto Voxels. Who here has heard of crypto voxels? Okay, so not that many people. So Crypto Voxels is a virtual world where the land is represented as ERC 721 NFTs. And it actually just started as one developer, and he just started selling this virtual land.
00:10:16.152 - 00:10:23.060, Speaker B: He sold it at a pretty low price. And when you own this land, it's kind of like minecraft. You could build things on top of it.
00:10:24.070 - 00:10:35.462, Speaker A: So here the other interesting thing the developer did, was he allowed you to pull in your assets into this virtual world. So this is a CryptoKitties museum inside.
00:10:35.516 - 00:10:45.180, Speaker B: Of Crypto Voxels where you could actually go and purchase these CryptoKitties inside of the virtual world. So I'll do a quick demo.
00:10:53.010 - 00:11:06.660, Speaker A: So one interesting thing that has happened is there are now folks who are curators of digital collectibles, and they have started.
00:11:08.470 - 00:11:24.710, Speaker B: Creating galleries in Crypto Voxels to explore these artwork. So this is a gallery from someone who basically thinks of themselves as a digital art curator and has sort of created this museum.
00:11:34.030 - 00:11:59.138, Speaker A: Another interesting NFT project was cryptostamp. So Cryptostamp is an interesting one because it was actually coupled to a physical stamp. So the Austrian postal service basically created this line of collectible stamps where if you purchase one, you would not only get a real usable stamp a lot.
00:11:59.144 - 00:12:00.306, Speaker B: Of people probably don't use those these.
00:12:00.328 - 00:12:04.526, Speaker A: Days, but you would get a stamp, and then you'd also get a crypto.
00:12:04.558 - 00:12:08.114, Speaker B: Collectible that you could trade on an open marketplace.
00:12:08.242 - 00:12:12.886, Speaker A: And this was kind of an interesting way to engage an existing community of.
00:12:12.988 - 00:12:16.034, Speaker B: Stamp collectors in digital assets.
00:12:16.162 - 00:12:22.422, Speaker A: And we think we'll see a lot of that kind of tethering these virtual.
00:12:22.486 - 00:12:25.050, Speaker B: Assets to a real life physical asset.
00:12:28.430 - 00:12:49.662, Speaker A: And then, of course, the most recent one is the ENS project. So ENS is a name system for ethereum. So you can think of it kind of like.com and right now, these assets are tradable as ERC 721s. Most recently, we collaborated with the ENS.
00:12:49.726 - 00:13:06.280, Speaker B: Team on doing the auctions for their short name names. So these were basically names like Set ETH that were reserved for an auction system that is actually currently taking place right now.
00:13:08.750 - 00:13:15.594, Speaker A: All right, so I guess any questions about NFTs or ERC 721 before I.
00:13:15.632 - 00:13:19.100, Speaker B: Hop into the workshop part?
00:13:22.130 - 00:13:30.160, Speaker A: Is there a conference about NFT? NFT, NYC february 20.
00:13:34.230 - 00:13:36.900, Speaker C: What's the growth comment you've seen?
00:13:38.070 - 00:13:42.578, Speaker A: So the initial spike in usage of.
00:13:42.584 - 00:13:57.366, Speaker B: NFTs was crypto goodies. And you probably remember these cats selling for like $50,000 each, and nothing has risen to that level of market volume. But I think that was to some.
00:13:57.388 - 00:14:01.574, Speaker A: Extent an anomaly in terms of market volume growth.
00:14:01.702 - 00:14:10.570, Speaker B: It's sort of slow but steady linear growth at the moment. So we're seeing high growth in the number of projects that enter the space.
00:14:10.720 - 00:14:13.626, Speaker A: We're seeing sort of gradual growth in.
00:14:13.648 - 00:14:26.226, Speaker B: The number of users that are trying them out. So it's a lot of the same early adopter type folks who are kind of trying these out. And there's a variety of reasons that's the case. I think usability, Scalability, all those is.
00:14:26.248 - 00:14:29.662, Speaker A: It gaming or is it yeah, it's all in gaming.
00:14:29.726 - 00:14:30.580, Speaker C: Pretty much.
00:14:33.350 - 00:14:41.782, Speaker A: The art. It's also interesting, but still pretty small, I think, for art.
00:14:41.836 - 00:14:49.626, Speaker B: The biggest thing is having a place to display the art. So projects like Crypto, Voxels and Decentraland kind of add that utility to the art.
00:14:49.648 - 00:14:51.574, Speaker A: But there are a number of crypto.
00:14:51.622 - 00:15:02.140, Speaker B: Artists who have sold quirks for five to ten E because they have such a solid reputation in the space. So it is starting to be interesting.
00:15:03.070 - 00:15:06.890, Speaker D: Are there tools for integrating composable NFTs of life trading?
00:15:08.450 - 00:15:11.294, Speaker A: Yeah, so there was a standard called.
00:15:11.332 - 00:15:14.386, Speaker B: ERC Nine Nine Eight that did that.
00:15:14.568 - 00:15:17.634, Speaker A: I'm not aware of any easy to.
00:15:17.672 - 00:15:34.680, Speaker B: Use tools that allow you to we have bundles which basically allow you to sell a bunch of NFTs at the same time, but that's a little bit different. I don't know of any websites at the moment that are making it really easy to compose NFTs together, but it's an interesting project.
00:15:35.370 - 00:15:39.434, Speaker E: What do you think needs to happen before we can see multiple of the.
00:15:39.552 - 00:15:52.400, Speaker A: Growth, before we see high growth of volume transactions on this open market? Yeah, that's like a common question I think for everyone.
00:15:52.930 - 00:15:54.990, Speaker B: It's asked at nearly every panel.
00:15:56.290 - 00:16:04.782, Speaker A: Yeah, for NFTs I think maybe a couple different axes. So one is quality of the games.
00:16:04.846 - 00:16:34.860, Speaker B: Which is steadily growing but the development time of the game is actually typically pretty long. So I think the quality of the experiences have to be high enough for people to want to use them and right now they're getting there but they're not quite there and then just usability of the network in general. So things, better wallets, potentially better blockchains for people to build these assets on.
00:16:35.710 - 00:16:38.646, Speaker A: What's preventing existing and high quality games.
00:16:38.678 - 00:16:40.330, Speaker F: From move towards the blockchain?
00:16:41.250 - 00:16:57.026, Speaker A: I think the main thing preventing them is well, I guess a couple of things. One is I think it's kind of tricky for an existing game to just move their assets to the blockchain, especially if it was a really big game.
00:16:57.128 - 00:16:59.860, Speaker B: And they wanted the same user experience.
00:17:00.950 - 00:17:02.894, Speaker A: They could hide away all the Ethereum.
00:17:02.942 - 00:17:08.040, Speaker B: Stuff but then they're just basically using a really expensive database for their game.
00:17:09.690 - 00:17:11.606, Speaker A: So I think the games that are.
00:17:11.628 - 00:17:17.602, Speaker B: Most effective have to be new games and those new games suffer from the.
00:17:17.756 - 00:17:24.074, Speaker A: Onboarding experience of getting ether. Some hide it but then they use.
00:17:24.112 - 00:17:37.440, Speaker B: Everything and then they're kind of competing with every other game. But if they leverage the blockchain in an interesting way then there are some really interesting user benefits like trading on open marketplaces, using them in the actual world.
00:17:38.130 - 00:17:54.050, Speaker A: Are we seeing any adoption from virtual reality mainstays or augmented reality producers? Not just the games, but maybe even like interest from the manufacturers of the headsets and such? I'm not sure.
00:17:54.120 - 00:17:58.920, Speaker B: Yeah, other than the virtual reality projects, I'm not sure.
00:18:00.730 - 00:18:32.190, Speaker E: How do you think about the kind of global scarcity of these NFCs? Because it seems to be, like one property that they have is that they're unique individually but kind of collectively they dilute each other. Because unlike collectibles in the real world where there's kind of, like, minimal cost of production it's really easy for lots of people to start creating these and they all just end up kind of diluting each other. So where do you think the value ends up brewing? Is it around the utility of the NFT because you can't kind of fake that or are there brands like Think?
00:18:32.260 - 00:19:01.810, Speaker B: Yeah, utility and Provenance and maybe some other things. So utility of the NFT in a game, right? Same as, like, fortnite, right? If you can wear a legendary or a well known skin that's cool, you can show it off. So that's sort of utility. And then Providence is like oh, this was the officially endorsed Disney collectible. And hence and Disney has said, this.
00:19:01.820 - 00:19:03.242, Speaker A: Is the smart contract we're using.
00:19:03.296 - 00:19:22.122, Speaker B: There will only be this number of them. I think that kind of with the Austrian postal service. Right. Not a huge brand, but they basically said, this is the official crypto stamp for the Austrian postal service. There's only five red stamps, hence those might be valuable for collectors.
00:19:22.266 - 00:19:29.410, Speaker E: Have you seen anyone trying to create a kind of art here at the age via, like, having to burn some other assets?
00:19:30.870 - 00:19:36.118, Speaker A: Yeah, so there have been a lot of swap your CryptoKitty or burn your.
00:19:36.124 - 00:20:00.880, Speaker B: CryptoKitty to receive crypto. I think it was like Crypto Strikers that did this. So that's a really good point. I think a very interesting way to engage the existing community is to leverage the existing set of NFTs, right. So go to CryptoKitties and say, oh, now they're useful in this other game, or you can trade them in for our game asset. That's better, or something like that.
00:20:03.090 - 00:20:03.454, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:20:03.492 - 00:20:14.900, Speaker B: And then there's also, like, NFT airdrops now, so people will airdrop a promotional NFT in your account. There's like tons of things you could do. It's pretty interesting, actually.
00:20:18.070 - 00:20:25.670, Speaker C: Have you seen anybody kind of use NFTs as like a commissioning based system? Like, I have this asset, so therefore I have the rights to this?
00:20:25.820 - 00:20:26.182, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:20:26.236 - 00:20:30.520, Speaker A: So there's the unlock protocol, which is.
00:20:31.050 - 00:20:54.062, Speaker B: Basically sort of a subscription service that you buy an NFT and then you get access to content or something like that. So that's kind of what they're going after, is they're talking to publishers and saying for. That also a DevCon ticket sold on OpenSea for seven E the other day. So tickets are kind of a permissioning system.
00:20:54.116 - 00:20:54.720, Speaker F: Right.
00:20:55.810 - 00:20:57.760, Speaker B: So there's stuff like that.
00:21:02.390 - 00:21:11.650, Speaker A: All right, so now digging into the nitty gritty. So if anyone has their laptop, they can follow along.
00:21:11.720 - 00:21:14.980, Speaker B: If not, just watch me do stuff.
00:21:15.290 - 00:21:35.834, Speaker A: So this is the ERC 721 interface. It's basically a lot like ERC 20, except that the key method is sort of this owner of token ID. Right. So the token ID you can think.
00:21:35.872 - 00:21:43.706, Speaker B: Of as, for example, like an individual CryptoKitty would have a token ID of something and to check who owns that.
00:21:43.728 - 00:21:48.334, Speaker A: CryptoKitty you call owner of. And then maybe some of you are.
00:21:48.372 - 00:21:52.142, Speaker B: Familiar with the idea of approved in ERT 20.
00:21:52.196 - 00:21:54.260, Speaker A: But basically this is a way for.
00:21:55.110 - 00:22:28.140, Speaker B: An individual to say, I approve this account to transfer my item. So for exchanges this is very useful because you can approve OpenSea or actually a proxy, but that's kind of a detail to transfer your items in the event of a sale so that they don't have to actually leave your wallet while they're on sale. And then this transfer from is obviously a really key one. This is basically the ability to transfer a CryptoKitty or what have you from an address to another address.
00:22:29.550 - 00:22:37.422, Speaker A: Then the kind of interesting, very interesting part of ERT 721 is you have.
00:22:37.476 - 00:22:48.446, Speaker B: These Token IDs, but how do you actually represent what a CryptoKitty is, which has a name, it has an image.
00:22:48.558 - 00:22:58.386, Speaker A: It has a description, it has maybe some traits. So where does that live? And at the moment, all of that lives off chain. I don't think there's can't think of.
00:22:58.408 - 00:23:09.054, Speaker B: A single ERC 721 that has put a lot of data on chain. There are 720 ones that put some data on chain, but most have some off chain component.
00:23:09.202 - 00:23:23.486, Speaker A: So that's where this Token Uri comes into play. So Token Uri is basically a way for the ERC 721 developer to say, this is where you can grab all.
00:23:23.508 - 00:23:28.254, Speaker B: The data for my item. So this takes in a Token ID.
00:23:28.292 - 00:23:43.474, Speaker A: And returns a URL. So here's an example of some data that would be returned from the URL when you hit it that represents the asset. So this is actually one of our.
00:23:43.512 - 00:23:46.370, Speaker B: Test assets called an Open Sea Creature.
00:23:46.530 - 00:23:56.742, Speaker A: And you can see it has a description, an image, a name, an external URL, and these all map to this item, right?
00:23:56.796 - 00:24:00.454, Speaker B: So you can see the image.
00:24:00.582 - 00:24:20.494, Speaker A: This view on OpenSea Creature is basically the external URL that you would kind of click into. And then it has these properties which this is kind of an addition that OpenSea made up to allow you to add a little more rich data to your items. But what's cool is that as long.
00:24:20.532 - 00:24:23.440, Speaker B: As you implement the Token Uri and.
00:24:24.050 - 00:24:26.674, Speaker A: You conform to the ERC 721 standard.
00:24:26.792 - 00:24:34.966, Speaker B: You kind of get it all for free. And as you can see, this is automatically tradable all that stuff because it is ERC 721.
00:24:34.968 - 00:24:41.462, Speaker A: And then the other interesting thing is this is also what is allowing for.
00:24:41.596 - 00:24:50.694, Speaker B: Limited degrees of interoperability. So this is that same OpenSea Creature inside of that crypto Voxels game that I was mentioning.
00:24:50.742 - 00:24:50.954, Speaker F: Right?
00:24:50.992 - 00:25:17.122, Speaker B: So now, because that metadata is standardized, crypto Voxels or whatever site can go and pull it or use the openc API, which makes it a little more convenient to grab this asset and display it in a virtual world. And Ether Scan as well has actually recently just started listing all the inventory of ERC 721s, which I think is.
00:25:17.256 - 00:25:19.394, Speaker A: An interesting sign that they're sort of.
00:25:19.432 - 00:25:29.430, Speaker B: Starting to achieve the same level of significance as ERC 20, which has had a nice ether scan interface for a while.
00:25:29.580 - 00:25:47.498, Speaker A: Did crypto also need any kind of permission or anything to grab and display it? Is there any kind of control over who can look at it? They don't own it. Right, so they did not need permission to check who the owner of that NFT is.
00:25:47.664 - 00:26:00.990, Speaker B: They didn't need permission to call the API to get the data. In cryptovoxel's case, they use our API as kind of a convenience thing. We kind of aggregate some data nicely. But yeah, no, they don't need any permission.
00:26:02.050 - 00:26:16.254, Speaker A: Can that metadata be changed by anyone Uri? Yeah, so we'll see if I get to the coding part of this, that it can be changed depending on where it's hosted.
00:26:16.302 - 00:26:35.800, Speaker B: So if you host it on an HTP server, you can certainly change it. There's not really a good standard around the metadata changing and then everything updating kind of just like pull. But if you post it on some decentralized Immutable file storage thing, then obviously.
00:26:38.090 - 00:26:53.760, Speaker D: I had a question about you to approve. So what happens if you approve it? You keep it in your wallet, but then when it actually gets sold, are you able to transfer?
00:26:55.570 - 00:26:59.540, Speaker A: Yeah. So before it gets sold, can you transfer it?
00:27:00.550 - 00:27:07.060, Speaker D: Could it be possible for something to be sold, for someone to think they're buying something?
00:27:09.610 - 00:27:14.342, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. So if I put a sale up.
00:27:14.396 - 00:27:40.570, Speaker B: On OpenSea, for example, that says I'm going to sell this, but then I transfer it somewhere else, then that sale will be kind of canceled by us. We'll keep track of, is the sale valid? And then maybe the more of an attack is like transferring it right before it gets bought. So in that case, the sale transaction would fail.
00:27:40.650 - 00:27:40.894, Speaker F: Right.
00:27:40.932 - 00:27:46.494, Speaker B: Because it would try to transfer something that no longer is in that account. So it's an atomic swap.
00:27:46.542 - 00:27:46.802, Speaker F: Right.
00:27:46.856 - 00:27:55.022, Speaker B: So there's no sort of scenario where, like, in the middle of the sale transaction, something gets transferred because this is like blockchain.
00:27:55.086 - 00:28:01.800, Speaker F: Right. Cool.
00:28:02.570 - 00:28:20.570, Speaker A: So did the token metadata. Yeah. So if anyone wants to try out deploying an ERC 721 contract, I made a starter repo that forks our basic.
00:28:21.090 - 00:28:25.002, Speaker B: Demo repo for folks who are non.
00:28:25.066 - 00:28:25.870, Speaker F: Technical.
00:28:29.810 - 00:28:32.234, Speaker A: There'S tons of ways to mint.
00:28:32.362 - 00:28:35.118, Speaker B: NFTs, which I encourage you to recommend.
00:28:35.204 - 00:28:43.170, Speaker A: Or encourage you to try out. So one example here is our rinkabee.
00:28:44.070 - 00:28:49.586, Speaker B: Instance of OpenSea, which is basically kind of a playground for creating NFTs.
00:28:49.778 - 00:28:51.922, Speaker A: You can go in our storefront manager.
00:28:51.986 - 00:28:59.142, Speaker B: And actually deploy a new contract and then Mint NFTs. There's also Mint Space.
00:28:59.196 - 00:29:06.886, Speaker A: I think I saw them in Nvidia Mintbase, which is a much better tool for deploying. Got to work on your SEO.
00:29:06.918 - 00:29:07.114, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:29:07.152 - 00:29:08.074, Speaker A: And mint base.
00:29:08.112 - 00:29:08.486, Speaker F: IO.
00:29:08.518 - 00:29:15.758, Speaker A: It's right there, down four. So Mintbase is like a much more.
00:29:15.844 - 00:29:48.410, Speaker B: Feature rich way of deploying. Interesting. NFTs our storefront manager, just like kind of this is one that I was deploying earlier this morning, but I'm pretending that these are the tickets for NFP NYC. And for the nontechnical folks, you can go to the Develop menu storefront manager and sort of go through the process with MetaMask for deploying a ERC 721 with an image and a name and description.
00:29:50.990 - 00:30:04.558, Speaker A: What's interesting about this is you can deploy an ERC 721 using any of these tools, and they're all compatible with each other. So it doesn't really matter if you.
00:30:04.564 - 00:30:18.340, Speaker B: Use Openc to deploy it, use Mintbase, or if you do it yourself. And for the developers, I'll go into a little bit of code to show what this would actually look like.
00:30:23.190 - 00:30:27.430, Speaker A: So this is can you blow that up?
00:30:27.500 - 00:30:31.000, Speaker F: Yeah, not.
00:30:38.350 - 00:30:48.540, Speaker A: So this is an example tradable ERC 721 token. A tradable ERC, 721 token. Don't think of it as anything really special.
00:30:48.990 - 00:31:34.300, Speaker B: We just added some utility functions. Oh, sorry. Also, my linter is not very happy. Just a simple way to mint. If you go to our documentation, you'll also see some special stuff we do with pre approving tokens for trading. But basically it's just an ERC 721 inherited from the Open Zeppelin ERC 721 Full, which has all sorts of nice things associated with it. It has the Token Uri, it has easy ways to mint, easy ways to burn all that stuff.
00:31:34.300 - 00:31:40.366, Speaker B: It's very simple to deploy 721, even.
00:31:40.388 - 00:31:41.386, Speaker A: If you're not a coder.
00:31:41.498 - 00:32:09.654, Speaker B: But even as a coder, you can do it pretty easily. So I will attempt to deploy this so I won't try to have everyone do it because I think we don't have enough time.
00:32:09.692 - 00:32:25.690, Speaker A: But basically you could create a N file and that would sort of configure all the accounts that you want to use to deploy your contract.
00:32:26.110 - 00:32:29.226, Speaker B: So it also sets up a you.
00:32:29.248 - 00:32:33.440, Speaker A: Can get an infuria key and inject it in there.
00:32:34.370 - 00:32:40.510, Speaker B: And then if you run the Minting script, or sorry, if you run the deployment script.
00:32:43.350 - 00:32:44.420, Speaker F: This one.
00:32:47.990 - 00:32:58.750, Speaker B: Then in theory this will give you a new ERC 721 contract. And one cool thing is that Openc.
00:32:58.830 - 00:33:02.694, Speaker A: Will actually pick up kind of like Ether scan will pick up any new.
00:33:02.732 - 00:33:04.882, Speaker B: ERC, seven hundred and twenty one S that are deployed.
00:33:05.026 - 00:33:10.390, Speaker A: So once we mint our first asset on this ERC 721 contract.
00:33:12.490 - 00:34:13.254, Speaker B: It'Ll automatically show up on Openc and you could go and trade it. So we'll wait for the contract to deploy. In the meantime, I can start talking about the Minting script. So, yeah, here it is. So here's our contract. Oh, no, sorry, that's so the Minting script.
00:34:13.302 - 00:34:14.750, Speaker A: This is this is kind of where.
00:34:14.820 - 00:34:31.630, Speaker B: The Token Uri immutable versus non immutable data storage becomes kind of interesting. So this Minting script I made earlier today, and it basically just uses some.
00:34:31.700 - 00:34:34.334, Speaker A: JSON storage site that I found.
00:34:34.452 - 00:34:45.714, Speaker B: So if we go to this, I literally just created a little bit of JSON.
00:34:45.762 - 00:34:45.974, Speaker F: Right?
00:34:46.012 - 00:34:57.066, Speaker B: So name? Hello, description? Hi there. And then an image. And this is really good enough for the metadata standard, technically, but to the.
00:34:57.088 - 00:35:00.334, Speaker A: Point back there, I could go and modify this.
00:35:00.372 - 00:35:00.526, Speaker F: Right?
00:35:00.548 - 00:35:03.680, Speaker B: So if you're trying to create an NFT that.
00:35:05.490 - 00:35:10.474, Speaker A: Has an immutable image associated with it, it's always the same name, et cetera.
00:35:10.522 - 00:35:21.090, Speaker B: Then you'll probably want to look into something like IPFS so that your customers can have this guarantee that their items won't be changed.
00:35:22.870 - 00:35:43.174, Speaker C: Yeah. On that note, it seems like most people are using URLs for that. Are most readers of NFTs configured to pull the URL? Or do many of them have support for say reading an IPFS dash.
00:35:43.302 - 00:35:51.530, Speaker A: Yeah, so certainly we have support for IPFS. There's not that many NFT readers.
00:35:52.030 - 00:35:54.300, Speaker B: Most of them use our API, because.
00:35:54.990 - 00:35:57.038, Speaker A: In the early days with CryptoKitties, there.
00:35:57.044 - 00:36:07.394, Speaker B: Was actually no token Uri standard. And so everyone just had their own weird API that showed data in some random way. And people still deploy ERC 721 without.
00:36:07.432 - 00:36:08.930, Speaker A: Conforming to the metadata standard.
00:36:09.080 - 00:36:29.080, Speaker B: So a lot of folks use our API, which is not a very good thing. We don't want to be the central point of NFT management or whatever, but yeah, if you were building a open source NFT aggregator, you would definitely want to support something like.
00:36:35.630 - 00:36:42.110, Speaker A: My other time, four minutes. So we do have our ERC 721 contract.
00:36:42.930 - 00:36:51.200, Speaker B: We can go on Rinkabee Etherscan and check it out.
00:36:51.650 - 00:36:52.510, Speaker F: Exciting.
00:36:54.470 - 00:37:05.314, Speaker B: And then we could mint some items on here. So don't worry, this like environment stuff.
00:37:05.352 - 00:37:09.460, Speaker F: Is not I'll just like throw away. So.
00:37:13.750 - 00:38:02.326, Speaker B: I'm gonna replace this address here, and then hopefully if I run the Minting script, it'll mint some items with that metadata that I showed you. And after it's done that, you can view an item on Openc if you just use a little bit of URL wizardry by hittingassets address TokenID. I think we have to wait for.
00:38:02.348 - 00:38:03.830, Speaker F: It to deploy.
00:38:24.210 - 00:38:40.900, Speaker B: So it has minted token ID number one, and now we can go to Rinkabee One and hopefully it should show up. Yeah, so that's the image I used. It was called hello.
00:38:41.430 - 00:38:43.058, Speaker A: And then some other interesting things you.
00:38:43.064 - 00:39:16.240, Speaker B: Can do here are you can immediately put this on sale both through the Openc UI or programmatically. Through our SDK, you can sell it in a different token. On mainnet, we support stablecoins and things like that. On testnet, we support this test token. You could create sort of a Dutch auction where you started at a certain price, ended another price. You could create a private sale ebay style auction. You could bundle it together with other NFTs, even from other contracts and things like that.
00:39:16.240 - 00:39:27.380, Speaker B: So there's all these things you can immediately do with it and you can see the history for it. So it was born a minute ago to my account.
00:39:29.350 - 00:39:35.454, Speaker A: And lastly, because I think I'm running out of time, you can configure this.
00:39:35.512 - 00:40:17.970, Speaker B: So you get a free storefront. So deployed a lot of contracts called Creature, but assets Creature 49, and you can actually edit this storefront. And what's interesting here is we use the ownable owner of the contract to permission who can edit their storefront. So if I go to edit storefront, I can add an image for the storefront and description, and then my marketplace fees, which are basically whenever something sells, I'll take a cut of those sales to a payout address and then a little bit around how the items are displayed.
00:40:19.830 - 00:40:20.580, Speaker F: Okay.
00:40:24.630 - 00:40:27.480, Speaker A: All right, any last minute questions?
00:40:30.570 - 00:40:31.480, Speaker F: All right.
00:40:34.010 - 00:40:34.580, Speaker B: Thanks so much.
