00:00:12.010 - 00:00:54.750, Speaker A: Hello everyone. I'm Sean, and I'm a software engineer at Airsoft. And today we'll be analyzing decentralized exchange liquidity. So since Ethereum was introduced in 2015, the popularity of decentralized exchanges has exploded. And as expected, many individuals and businesses took advantage coming up niches. This boom birthed a lot of amazing projects and with true innovation. But it also created a saturated market of DEXes.
00:00:54.750 - 00:01:57.010, Speaker A: So currently there's hundreds of DEXes in the wild, with most of them in Ethereum. And since the source of liquidity for each of these DEXes is different, the price can also vary drastically. On average, there can be more than a 20% difference in price across DEXes, so this makes it very hard to keep track of which Dex has the best price for a given amount of token. So that's why we decided to build Dex Index. Dex Index is a Dex price aggregator that fetches quotes from 13 popular DEXes currently. And it's powered by an open source JavaScript library, that is anyone can contribute to and also use for their own projects. Also it's open source so that we don't give any particular decks an unfair advantage.
00:01:57.010 - 00:03:04.680, Speaker A: It also has a clean and simple UI, so you can do what you need to do, which is finding the best price. As you can see, we just select an action sell or buy an amount and a token and you'll get a list of DEXes with quotes ordered by Best price. Using Dex index is very simple. You just import the library and you call main function, which would get you the list of the quotes given the parameters ordered by Best Price. You can also look at the documentation to see other features that Dex Index provides, like the command line tool. And since we launched Dex Index in January, we gained some popularity from over 4000 unique users from 33 countries, fetching more than 43,000 quotes from 1200 tokens. And we also saw some open source community activity as well.
00:03:04.680 - 00:04:12.720, Speaker A: We believe that this growing popularity of Dex Index is actually due to a growing issue in the Ethereum community, and that is that data needs consolidation. So while diversity and innovation is great and produces amazing projects, people still want a consolidated source of data. So what does that tell us? Well, the community needs your help to build tools that not only find the best amongst competitors, but one that actually creates a friendly and easy environment for users currently in and entering the Ethereum community. Dextendex can also use their help. We currently have 13 popular DEXes integrated, but we can always use four. Whether it be DEXes you love and want to see or DEXes you're currently working on. So feel free to submit a pull request and our team will gladly take a look at it.
00:04:12.720 - 00:04:13.900, Speaker A: Thank you.
