00:00:12.730 - 00:00:46.982, Speaker A: So I'll be focusing on the asset, not so much ethereum, the protocol. And it turns out there's only one Defcon talk about Ether, the asset, and that's the one right now. And I'm hoping that this time next year, we will have multiple talks about ether, the asset. Because in my opinion, E 30 asset is critical. For Ethereum to be successful in its mission in becoming the settlement layer for the Internet of value. We need to understand it, we need to nurture it. So, yeah, without Efer, there's no ethereum.
00:00:46.982 - 00:01:42.570, Speaker A: And if Ethereum becomes the settlement layer for the Internet of value, then de facto efer will become something very special, namely money for the Internet, Internet money. And there's this deep friendship between Ether and Ethereum that I'm going to try and tell you about today. But before we get there, I want to give you a mental model around the temperature of money, or some people call it the velocity of money. I'm going to invite you to think of money as water, which can be in multiple states. It can be liquid, it could be solid if it's cooled down and frozen. And it can be in this gas state if it has extremely high velocity. And this is interesting because at layer one, we have mechanisms that explore these extreme temperatures.
00:01:42.570 - 00:02:26.438, Speaker A: So you can take Efer water, and at layer one, you can freeze it, you can stake it, and in the process of staking, you're reducing the velocity of that Efer because it's kind of put in a black box and can't move. And something similar happens with the burn. The burn is all about destroying EF, consuming it, vaporizing it, and turning it into gas vapor. And something very similar happens at L2. So at layer one, all of this is enshrined in the sense that Efer has a monopoly. And at L2, there's something similar happening, but it's more of an emergent ecosystem. It's more competitive.
00:02:26.438 - 00:03:25.086, Speaker A: So what happens at L2 is that ether, or other forms of money, get bonded and get used as collateral in the context of decentralized finance. And money could also be used as currency when you're transacting, for example, when eth flows through the pipes of uniswap. And the word currency comes from the word current, and it's basically money that is moving. And most of the time, when people hear the word money, they think currency, and they only think about the high velocity use cases. But it turns out that especially for Ethereum, we shouldn't be discounting the low velocity use cases as those are extremely important as well. Using efer as collateral is a use of money. So just to recap, we have Efer programmable money, which can be programmed to do various things that contribute towards Ethereum, a little bit like a stem cell.
00:03:25.086 - 00:04:11.770, Speaker A: It can be fully programmed to be a brain cell or a heart cell or liver cell. And ether could be programmed to be stake, contribute towards security. It can be programmed to be base fees and contribute towards the sustainability of Ethereum as a project. Economic sustainability, economic security. It can contribute as economic bandwidth in the context of defi, and it can contribute to economic activity that is on top of Ethereum within the decentralized ecosystem. And one thing that I want to highlight again is that there's these two different economies. There's the cold economy of money, mostly collateral money, and there's the hot economy.
00:04:11.770 - 00:05:05.166, Speaker A: And both are extremely important. And in this talk, we're going to go through the various uses of efer, that kind of help Ethereum become a settlement layer for the Internet of value, starting with security. So if Ethereum is going to settle the Internet of value, it shouldn't get crushed by the economic weight of it, because the Internet of value is going to be massive. It's going to be tens of trillions of dollars, and we can't have the internal value be secured by, like, a tiny amount of ethereum economic security. And so there's this important concept of the security ratio, which is simply the total value secured divided by the economic security that Ethereum has. And right now, we're at a point where the security ratio is very healthy. It's only 20.
00:05:05.166 - 00:05:50.538, Speaker A: The lower the better. And Ethereum is securing roughly $400 billion of value in the form of ERC, twenty s and nfts. And because it has roughly $20 billion of economic security, that gives us the security ratio of 20, $20 billion of economic security. Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? Well, in a way, it is a good thing, especially for Ethereum, that is such a nascent project. And it's especially good that it's become. Ethereum today is the most secure blockchain, even surpassing its older brother, bitcoin, by a factor of two x. So if you want to do a 51% attack on Ethereum, that's going to cost you $20 billion.
00:05:50.538 - 00:06:42.182, Speaker A: If you want to do a 51% attack on bitcoin, that's going to cost you roughly $10 billion. But $20 billion, in the grand scheme of things, is that a lot? No, it's not. I would argue that we want trillions of dollars of economic security for Ethereum, partly because we want to keep that security ratio relatively low, but also because we don't want any attacker, even the most sophisticated ones like nation states, to be able to attack Ethereum. And if we have so much economic activity, then we'll be protected. Now, the economic security comes from these eth deposits. And in the last two years we've had a very healthy, continuous stream of deposits on the order of 20,000 e every single day for roughly two years. And so now we're at a point where we have 14.2
00:06:42.182 - 00:07:34.366, Speaker A: million e staked, and we can ask ourselves how much eth can we expect to be staked in the long term? And the way that I think about it is by looking at what incentivizes people to stake, which is issuance. So there's two parts to staking. There's the cold economy, where you're freezing money at stake, but there's also the hot component, which is when you're issuing ether as incentives for validators. And it turns out you can look at the yield from issuance. And there's this relationship, which is that every time the amount of e stake grows by a factor of four x, the yield from issuance decreases by a factor of two. So with 4 million e staked, the yield from issuance would be 8%. With 16 million e staked it would be 4%.
00:07:34.366 - 00:08:16.060, Speaker A: And with 64 million e staked, it would be 6%. Sorry, 2%. And now it turns out that what we should expect is that the yield from issuance is going to have an equilibrium with the cost of money. And if the cost of money is, let's say 3%, then we should expect something between 16 and 64, something like 30 million e staked. Now this brings us to the importance of the e price, because we have, let's say, two x increase in the amount of e staked. Like how are we going to get trillions of dollars of economic security? So today we have $20 billion of economic security. We want to get, let's say, to $1 trillion.
00:08:16.060 - 00:08:55.718, Speaker A: That's a 50 x increase. We can get a two x increase from e stake to $40 billion, but we're going to need more than that. And specifically, we're going to need the price of efer to go up 25 x in order to get this really robust amount of economic security. Now one thing I want to mention at the end of this first section is this idea of minimizing the cost of security. So issuance has negative externalities because it dilutes all the holders. And at Genesis, we were issuing a lot of ETH, roughly 12.5 million e every single year.
00:08:55.718 - 00:09:37.242, Speaker A: And now we're at a point at the merge where we've decreased that by roughly a factor of 20 x. And we've reached a point where the issuance is extremely small and it's essentially optimal. And that because we can't improve it, this is actually a forcing function for us to essentially ossify it, because we've reached the best possible design. Great. So now that we understand that ETH is critical to the security of Ethereum, let's talk about sustainability. Now, what do I mean by sustainability? We can think of Ethereum as a company, and the product that it's selling is blockspace. Specifically, secure blockspace, extremely secure blockspace.
00:09:37.242 - 00:10:09.018, Speaker A: And as a project, it has income and it has expenses, and that leads to profits. And we want profit to eventually be positive. We want the project to be successful, to be sustainable. So income is the block space, sales, expenses is the security budget. And that's basically for Ethereum, is the burn, minus the issuance. And we can go further than that. We can actually look at pe ratios, for example, and analyze Ethereum almost as if it was a tech stock.
00:10:09.018 - 00:11:04.610, Speaker A: Now, since the merge, despite the massive reduction in cost of security, we are still not sustainable in the sense that Ethereum is still not able to pay for its security to compensate that with the income that it gets from selling block space. But the good news is that the amount of unsustainability is absolutely tiny. It's less than 0.1% per year. If we were to zoom out a little bit, because right now we're at a moment in history where the depth of a bear market and the transaction fees are very low. But if we were to zoom out even just a little bit, then we'll see that actually ethereum is in a position to burn much, much faster than it is issuing. So if we take all the data that we have since EIP 1559, we're burning roughly at a rate that's 3.5
00:11:04.610 - 00:12:04.510, Speaker A: times the amount that we're issuing today. And so the supply growth is expected to be negative. And so we have this shape of the supply, which we should have, which is that during the first seven years of EfA's existence, the supply has grown very, very fast from this extremely high issuance. And the peak is this inflection point around the merge, after which the supply will start decreasing and finding a new equilibrium. And this is what birthed the ultrasound money meme. If we call monies that strong, monies that can't be debased artificially because they have a cap supply, sound money, then surely something that has a decreasing supply, where the money becomes stronger and stronger every single day, should be called ultrasound money. And it turns out that bats produce ultrasounds.
00:12:04.510 - 00:12:53.730, Speaker A: And David, who's with us here, kind of innovated here at the mementic level and said, let's wear the bat signal to spread the ultrasound money meme. And this is where he started. We now have thousands of accounts on Twitter that are spreading the ultrasound money meme with the bad signal. And there's a community that is being built as we speak. Okay, so ethereum needs security. It will almost certainly be sustainable, thanks to all the fees that it's collecting and burning, compensating for the cost of security. What about the application layer? What about economic bandwidth? So EF is used as economic bandwidth for decentralized applications.
00:12:53.730 - 00:13:39.106, Speaker A: So two examples would be maker, which uses 1.4 million e as collateral to power its decentralized stablecoin, and Ave, which is consuming roughly half a million e for its decentralized loans. And the reason why ETH is such a good choice as a collateral asset is because it's pristine. And what we mean by pristine is that it doesn't have a lot of these tail risks that other assets might have. It has no contract risk, no custodial risk, no oracle risk, no bridge risk, and no governance risk. But there is one downside to ETH, which is that it is pretty damn volatile. And so one of the things that we can try and do is stabilize E.
00:13:39.106 - 00:14:23.470, Speaker A: And this is exactly what stablecoins are, specifically decentralized stablecoins that are backed by ether. And here are three different projects that are using ether to back their decentralized stablecoin. And right now, we using about 2 million e specifically for collateralizing decentralized stablecoins. Now, I believe that we're at the very early days of Efer being used as a collateral. In my opinion, Efer is the perfect collateral money. And so today, we may only have, let's say, 16 million e that's used as collateral, but in ten years time, it could easily be four times more. It could be something like 60 million e that is used as collateral.
00:14:23.470 - 00:15:17.250, Speaker A: Now, again, I want to emphasize the importance of the e price here in the context of economic bandwidth. Right now, we have about $1 billion of decentralized stablecoins that are collateralized by Ether, which is almost nothing and really, we want to be in a position where we have trillions of dollars of decentralized stablecoins, right? We don't want to see a future where the economic activity is denominated in USDC or USDT, which are centralized stablecoins. Now, let's say we want to get to $1 trillion of decentralized stablecoins. We need to grow 1000 x from where we are today. We can grow the amount of collateral quite a bit by 15 x, but that would only give us $15 billion. We need the price to go up. Essentially, we need Ethereum to be successful so that we have a lot of economic bandwidth for decentralized stablecoins.
00:15:17.250 - 00:16:13.998, Speaker A: Now, one of the concepts I want to talk about here is the notion of illiquidity multiplier. So, you know how I kept on emphasizing that there's two economies within Ethereum. There's the liquid economy, which is hot, and the illiquid economy, which is cold. And really, all the cash flows happen within the liquid part. So if you think of the burn, it's liquid eth that is burnt to pay for block space. And if you think of the issuance, there's like fresh ETH that is liquid that is added to the liquid portion. And so really, one way to think about the Ethereum market cap is to focus on the liquid portion, for which we have models, we have the discounted cash flow, we have p ratios, et cetera.
00:16:13.998 - 00:16:51.102, Speaker A: And then once we understand how much this liquid portion should be worth, the portion which is basically Ethereum as a business, as a tech company, then we can scale that out to the whole market cap. And the scaling factor is this illiquidity multiplier. And where we are today is that most of the ETH is liquid. And so the liquidity multiplier is actually tiny. It's just noise. It's like 25%, which is roughly the monthly volatility of Efer. But things change quite a bit once most of the ETH is used as collateral money.
00:16:51.102 - 00:17:33.834, Speaker A: Let's say that 80% of ETH is used as collateral money, and only 20% is liquid here, then the liquidity multiplier is pretty big. It's five x. So if the ethereum cash flows, if the business of selling block space is worth, let's say, $1 trillion, then the whole market cap of e 30 assets should be $5 trillion. Great. So we understand security, sustainability, bandwidth, all of these things are critical to the success of Ethereum, and they all are tied with e 30 assets. What about the last point, activity. So by activity, I just mean the amount of flows that are happening on top of Ethereum.
00:17:33.834 - 00:18:16.858, Speaker A: I'm thinking fluidity, liquidity, diversity, vitality, like all sorts of applications, millions of transactions per second, something very vibrant. And the only way that we can get there is with scalability. Now, the good news is that I believe we will be able to scale Ethereum roughly a million x. We have this massive wave of scalability coming. The surge is coming. And just to give you a little bit more detail, there's basically three technologies that compound on each other, each of which give us roughly 100 x in scalability. So we have roll ups that will bring us to 1000 transactions a second.
00:18:16.858 - 00:19:06.186, Speaker A: We have sharding, which was going to bring us to 100,000 transactions per second. And we have Nielsen's law, which is going to bring us to 10 million transactions a second. Nielsen's law is basically the equivalent law to Moore's law, but for bandwidth. And it turns out that bandwidth is the only fundamental resource that blockchains need to consume. Now, as we scale Ethereum by a million x, there's this concept of the ultrasound barrier, which is how much each single transaction needs to pay for Ethereum to remain sustainable. Basically, for Ethereum to have enough income to pay for its security expenses. And so the ultrasound barrier is going to decrease by roughly a million x.
00:19:06.186 - 00:19:46.534, Speaker A: So right now, we need to burn in base fees, roughly 3 million GUI for every single transaction. But once we scale things up a million x, we only need to pay per transaction, three gwe to be able to be sustainable. And the good news is that three gwe is an absolutely tiny amount of money. It's 3,000,000,000th of an efer. And even if this ether is widely successful, even if it's worth a million dollars, let's say three GWE would be still less than $0.01. It would be $0.3, basically one third of a cent.
00:19:46.534 - 00:20:48.662, Speaker A: And so basically, we're going to be in a position where Ethereum, to remain sustainable, requires transaction fees, which are essentially noise, essentially just dust. Now, one of the exciting thing about Ethereum as a business is that the secure block space is big business, and it's been growing extremely fast. And this is basically the daily block space sales since the very beginning of Ethereum. And the y axis is a logarithmic axis. So as time progresses, even though the per transaction fees might go down in aggregate, the income should increase. And this is partly due to a concept called induced demand. As you improve things as you reduce costs, then more and more users will come in, more and more decentralized applications will be built, and you're unlocking more and more activity.
00:20:48.662 - 00:21:29.698, Speaker A: And I expect this to continue to happen. Of course, the block space is a very volatile resource, and so these peaks and troughs, they're highly correlated with bears and bull markets. And it could look like the aggregate fee volume has dramatically decreased by a factor of 100 x. And it has. But 100 x in the grand scheme of things, is actually not much. Okay, so here's my last slide, and it's basically trying to give you a big picture summary. Talking in terms of orders of magnitude, in terms of where I see a potential future for Ethereum.
00:21:29.698 - 00:22:44.590, Speaker A: So I expect the supply to be roughly $100 million in the long term. So right now we're at $120,000,000, and the supply should decrease slowly and eventually in the equilibrium reach $100 million. Now, where will these 100 million efer live? So they will live partly as stake, securing Ethereum, partly as collateral, providing economic bandwidth for DFI, and partly as currency, for example, efer within exchanges like Uniswap, or even centralized exchanges. If we have roughly 30 million e staking, that's going to lead to roughly 1 million e per year of issuance. And if Ethereum is going to be sustainable as a business, then the burn must match that at also 1 million e per year. Now, the income, what I expect is, remember the previous graph? I expect the income for Ethereum to be billions of dollars every single day in selling block space, even though the per transaction fee will be less than a cent. So this is the success for Ethereum, where we can get the best of both worlds.
00:22:44.590 - 00:23:24.960, Speaker A: On the one hand, we get tiny transaction fees for one single transaction, but in aggregate, because we're doing 10 million transactions per second, actually, Ethereum has a huge amount of income, and that allows it to have a huge amount of economic security. And then again, in the success scenario, I'm expecting tens of trillions of dollars of economic bandwidth for deFi, and correspondingly tens of trillions of dollars of stable coins that are being traded on top of Ethereum. And I think if we do reach this potential future, then undoubtedly Ethereum will have succeeded in becoming the settlement layer for the intent of value. Thank you.
00:23:27.650 - 00:24:04.746, Speaker B: Hey, Justin, thanks so much, for one, making this talk highly approachable. Thank you for that. So I had a question with respect to, from your talk, what I would now call the illiquid premium, and I think it was actually in David's talk, where he had a friendly ultrasound debate where he gave up essentially the point that liquid staking derivatives then I guess, would reduce this illiquid premium. Could you potentially speak to that a little bit?
00:24:04.928 - 00:24:38.198, Speaker A: Yes, so I wouldn't have given up so easily for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that one of the main uses of the liquid staking token is to have leverage. And so what you end up doing is you end up locking this liquid staking token. And so that liquid staking token is itself not liquid. But there's maybe another reason which is more important, which has to do with the cost of money that I mentioned. So let's assume that the cost of money is fixed over time. Let's say it's 3%.
00:24:38.198 - 00:25:39.878, Speaker A: The cost of money is going to dictate how much eth is being staked. And what the liquid staking tokens do is they allow you to unstake immediately, as opposed to having to go through the exit queue. And you get this privilege of unstaking immediately by basically paying a very small fraction to market makers or arbitragers who will go through the pain of unstaking on your behalf. So you're going to sell, let's say, your one staked e for 0.99 etH, paying a little fee for the privilege of not having to go through the exit queue. Now what will happen is that these arbitragers, they will go through the process of unstaking, but when they do that, someone else will come in and compensate for this removal of stake. And the reason is that in the equilibrium, the amount of staked eth should correspond to the cost of money.
00:25:39.878 - 00:26:10.466, Speaker A: And so even if there's like a large amount of eth that on stakes, then in the equilibrium, more eth will come in to bring things in. And so really you can think of the total amount of ETH really, as being this illiquid iceberg that is essentially impossible to melt, because if you melt a small portion, another amount of ice grows on the other side. Awesome. We'll move on to our second question.
00:26:10.648 - 00:26:24.162, Speaker B: So in your future, why would there be tens of trillions of dollars of stablecoins instead of ether, just having much less volatility and becoming like a stablecoin.
00:26:24.306 - 00:27:15.350, Speaker A: Right. So you're really thinking ahead. So I'm thinking ten years into the future, and I think it is going to take a long time to transition from fiat currencies that live in central banks and commercial banks to basically stable coins that are settled on Ethereum. But I think you're right. If you want to think much further than ten years, if you want to think 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, then maybe there is a case for IFA, the asset to kind of be the stable money. I mean, one possible counterargument here is gold, in the sense that gold never really managed to become this perfectly stable asset. And it's possible that there will always be too much volatility relative to baskets of goods that people want to buy for EFA, the asset.
00:27:15.350 - 00:27:27.898, Speaker A: So I think at the minimum, we have to go through a transition period where we have these decentralized, stable coins, and it's possible that even in the end game, ether won't be stable enough.
00:27:28.064 - 00:28:17.190, Speaker C: This is just to extrapolate on the last question. The debate was that ether locked in the staking contract has always been a fundamentally bullish pillar of ether. The more ether that's locked in the contract, the more scarce it is, more value it has. And then Jordy in the debate was like, well, all these things are going to become staking derivatives so that you can easily sell. So there's no such thing as locking anymore. But the counterargument that I heard that I want to check with you, Justin, is that it doesn't matter whether you can easily sell it on the secondary market because the incentive to hold has always been through the yield, and you can always withdraw out of the staking contract. So is the 4-5-3 yield of ether equivalent to just, like, straight raw demand for holding this staking token regardless of whether you can unlock it or not? Are you saying that completely nullifies?
00:28:17.850 - 00:28:24.380, Speaker A: In my opinion, it does, yeah. Awesome. Well, please give Justin a big round of applause. Thank you so much. Thank you.
