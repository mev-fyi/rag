00:00:16.890 - 00:00:53.440, Speaker A: The most liquid token in the like except bitcoin right in the, in the crypto world. But it will have happen on natural causes eventually. Like liquidity is very important, but it can't compete with that. That's one thing. The other to answer the question, I was very much terrified this last half a year, but it turns out that I was way more pessimistic about how people actually sorry, my time is up.
00:00:55.570 - 00:01:05.294, Speaker B: To interrupt there. Hello. We just have five minutes more. That's the way to if we want questions from the audience.
00:01:05.422 - 00:01:12.178, Speaker C: Yeah, it would be great to take some questions from the audience. So sorry, Vasili, I'll give you a.
00:01:12.184 - 00:01:51.710, Speaker B: Quick yeah, can I just express the minority voice over here? Obviously LSDs has been great and pivotal in DeFi, especially before withdrawals are available. But there's also a lot of risks right there's the liquidity, the smart contracts, the pegging and all of that. And it all comes down basically to your risk tolerance. Right. Ethics King. In this case, when I give my Ether to another protocol, I give him my Ether and all the associated risks that come with it. And I think the big players in the upcoming, like the near years will still prefer to natively use ether.
00:01:51.710 - 00:01:53.582, Speaker B: Okay.
00:01:53.716 - 00:02:02.210, Speaker C: All right, well, thanks so much guys. We're going to move on to the audience Q A session because we have just a very small amount of time left. So I saw you shoot up your hand right real quickly right at the.
00:02:02.280 - 00:02:31.200, Speaker D: So hi, how are you? Congrats and thank you. My name is Pablo. I'm the founder of Sensei Node, the first node operator in Latin America. We are talking with all of you and I think something really important is not only geographically centralization, but also less dependence on Amazon. As most of the node operators work with Amazon, we try to work with local and regional data centers. My question is how do you distribute? Yeah.
00:02:35.270 - 00:02:36.020, Speaker E: Sure.
00:02:36.390 - 00:02:47.746, Speaker A: Yeah, I can answer that. It's very simple. The same way we do staking rewards. Like rewards are the same as taking. They go to stakers mostly the not operators get the fee and LiDAR gets its fee.
00:02:47.778 - 00:03:43.698, Speaker E: But 90% of rewards go to stakers with rocket pool. Obviously, as I said, 16 E is node operators, 16 E is liquid stakers. And so in terms of mev and priority fees, it's a kind of equal split between node operators and liquid stakers, except that the node operators get their fee on the rewards, so they get 15% of the commission on the rewards. So they still get that kind of extra bit from the mev and priority fees. That's the usual case. We've also got like a smoothing pool where this is particularly important for small node operators that are running kind of a couple of validators. The way that block proposals work is very variable.
00:03:43.698 - 00:04:08.430, Speaker E: So you can have like two a year or ten a year and that hits small node operators hard. So if you join the smoothing pool, everyone pulls their proposals together which works particularly well for mev because with mev that's essentially a lottery block. You may end up with a lottery block that goes into the smoothing pool and then basically everyone gets a share of the smoothing pool. So yeah, that's what we do.
00:04:08.580 - 00:04:12.320, Speaker B: We have time for one last question. What were two one here.
00:04:14.230 - 00:04:14.706, Speaker A: I have.
00:04:14.728 - 00:04:38.346, Speaker F: A question about operator set. So in the two cases here, like lido stakewise, more professional operators are involved. Rocket pool kind of a blend honestly of both would love to hear more about from stakewise and lido. Do you see a future where your pools include professional validators and at home validators working together to achieve a common yeah, yeah, sure.
00:04:38.448 - 00:05:38.730, Speaker A: So that's what we're trying to design right now. We think that most of the stake should be managed by professional operators still. But what we want is to lighter forbid pipeline from a home stake at a professional operator. So you can kind of operate as a solar operator in lido with small amount of stake and if you do it well and if you want to do it not as a hobby because honestly, most solar operators are not rational, they're not making a business out of it. They just do it for fun. Which is great, right. But if they want to do it for their job, they should have the ability to earn the reputation, earn the, the metrics required to get into the set of big boys and grow up because otherwise it will lead to catalyzation like three years tops.
00:05:40.910 - 00:06:34.640, Speaker G: And yeah, completely. So the way B three is designed, I pointed out solo stakers as a key target market but essentially this protocol will satisfy anybody who can run a node, can run a node on B three. And from discussions with commercial node operators, one of the key things for these guys is coming over to stakewise V three so they can provide liquid staking to their clients. And so in V three every single node operator or group of node operators will have their own little mini staking pool and then their users can then mint the liquid staking token so it offers liquid staking to everybody no matter whether you're a solo staker or commercial node operator. So by proxy we're going to end up with basically like an open marketplace of operators and groups of operators who are running various technologies who are on the stage today to compete for stake. And again that can be solo stakers and also commercial node operators as well.
00:06:35.570 - 00:06:36.560, Speaker C: Great, thanks.
00:06:38.690 - 00:06:39.438, Speaker B: Hi.
00:06:39.604 - 00:06:59.262, Speaker H: Does anyone of you dare to estimate the amount of, I mean the percent of solar staker that the network, that the network will have in like five years, I mean can be higher than now or lower than now? Great question because I mean LSDs are great, right? You can use your stake position as collateral and you also average out the rewards.
00:06:59.326 - 00:06:59.554, Speaker E: Right.
00:06:59.592 - 00:07:09.334, Speaker H: So why solo staking if there is no point of that? Right, some people will do it even for free but yeah, what will happen in the next five years? More solo stakers or less solo stakers?
00:07:09.382 - 00:07:09.980, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:07:11.070 - 00:07:31.840, Speaker G: Well, if stakewise V three works, we'll hopefully have more, as I said, the reason why and Vicili touched on it it's almost non economical to be a solo staker. You do it for fun or because you're a decentralization maxi and so our goal is to try and make it economical and let them get access to liquid staking which they have not been able to before.
00:07:35.430 - 00:08:02.680, Speaker E: With rocket pool it is pretty much no different to being a silo staker. You have autonomy over your node, you bring collateral so you have a stake the only difference is you get paid more. That's the only real difference from an ethereum perspective and from a decentralization perspective it's exactly the same. So that's where we come from there.
00:08:03.390 - 00:08:42.086, Speaker I: Yeah. If I was to add to that, I think the question is there'll be a long tail of solo stakers for sure. The question is how much stake will be on them and that's where everyone up here is trying to figure out how can you let solo stakers have a bit of capital and someone else's capital. The Rocket pool scenario of make them bond you've stakewise V three of let the people take the risk and choose a vault for a certain risk and we hope that with distributed validators you can trust small stakers as if they were an enterprise. You're like yep, there's four you guys and you're all credible and you're not one person. You guys can have 99.99% uptime so we can trust putting stake on you.
00:08:42.086 - 00:08:56.490, Speaker I: You can't exit, you can't even get slashed. So we hope with DBT, people like Lido stakewise all of them can throw a lot more ether onto small stakers and make it make sense, as you said, not be just a loss leading kind of diehard hobby.
00:08:57.870 - 00:10:02.378, Speaker A: Yeah, on our side, how we think about it is to have a lot of solo node operators you need to design system in a way that first does not require them to hold a bond because most people who want to run a node, they don't have this much money most people don't have this much money, period. Right. To run even half of the data lying around. So they have to be selected unbonded in some unbond way. And that means on other hand, that you need to manage risks and you need to manage the white labels. Like for example, if you want a lot of sole operators in the protocol and you want to incentivize that you need to understand that these are not like the one operator and these guys in trench code like 100 nodes. This is essential for node for protocols that mostly managed risk instead of bond.
00:10:02.378 - 00:10:14.370, Speaker A: But even in bondo protocol, there is a lot of folks who run the rocket pool with all nodes, for example. So these are hard problems to solve, but I believe they are solvable.
00:10:15.990 - 00:10:36.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I just want to add up to what Austin said. Imagine if you can use DBT to pair yourself with the reputable top class operators, or even to pair yourself with your friends, which you trust to run it. So the technology advances that will come will really reduce the barriers to do that in a still reliable way.
00:10:39.230 - 00:10:58.130, Speaker E: Another thing Rockapore doing, so currently it's 16 E you need. So in our next release it'll be eight, and then potentially in our next release, lower. So that's how you get more node operators. That's what we want, is more individual node operators, not necessarily more stake.
00:10:59.270 - 00:11:19.018, Speaker C: Great. All right, well, unfortunately, we are out of time for new audience questions. But I promise you, all five of these folks are going to be wandering around the conference floor after this. So if you have any questions for them or for me, we would all be very happy to chat with you throughout the rest of the day and throughout the rest of the week. Thank you so much, everybody, for coming.
00:11:19.184 - 00:11:19.560, Speaker B: Thank you.
