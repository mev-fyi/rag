00:00:13.370 - 00:00:40.998, Speaker A: Welcome to the Santa bounty's roundtable. The first thing I'll say is that I asked them for 2 hours on the schedule. Assuming that there might be a lot of things to talk about, I'm hoping it will take less than 2 hours and you can get the rest of your day back. Today is supposed to be a really nice day for the tech boot. So yeah, the workshop will be kind of like open ended. At any point you feel like you're no longer interested, don't hesitate to get up and go. Busy place.
00:00:40.998 - 00:01:29.960, Speaker A: But really the intention here was like, we've been trying to build standard boundaries for a long time and really trying to make it a collaborative effort across different projects in the community, rather than it just being like us, writing smart contracts. And so to that end, we wanted to have a place for people who are using it, or projects using it or interested in using it to talk about it and to share their ideas, their thoughts, problems, issues, and kind of thinking about what's next. So just like quick agenda, I think this is like a generally good flow for how the conversation might go. I'm just going to begin by stating some of our original intentions behind standard bounties and why we started building it in the first place. Then we'll launch into this group conversation about current issues. I'm sure you guys will have some up there. And in general, just like issues we've been seeing.
00:01:29.960 - 00:02:17.394, Speaker A: And then finally, better modes of collaboration so that again, it doesn't become like us just writing smart contracts, but we really do want it to be this interoperable and open contracts library that anybody can use for basic incentives, right? So the original intentions that we had when we started building bounties network, the first thing that we did was actually write standard bounties. And the reason was kind of these three main points. Number one is that we wanted to have this generalized tool for incentivizing anything. People have been talking about bug bounties for many years. People had started talking about code bounties, but it became a bun. And originally, actually bounty's network was a product for bug bounties. But at some point it became clear that the same mechanism could and therefore should be applied to any type of activity.
00:02:17.394 - 00:03:03.986, Speaker A: There's no point in limiting it, especially at a contract layer. And that what really makes more sense is that taking this idea of tokens and incentives on Ethereum and kind of letting people point that towards any type of action they wanted to see. And so to that end, so far we've seen a lot of stuff like Gitcoin is really popular and code bounties remain very important. But also we've seen a lot of interesting bounties in the design space, community development, translations, copywriting, but then also like social impact and people experimenting with new ways of just shaping human action using bounties and basic incentives. So that's been pretty fun. The next main intention, and this one's really important, is to have a shared interface for interoperable bounties. On Ethereum.
00:03:03.986 - 00:03:46.434, Speaker A: What I realized pretty early on was if you look at marketplaces right now that are like upwork or fiver, when someone posts a task, and I call this like a market order for work, they have to post it to each of these websites. There's no way. And of course they have their own very siloed marketplaces. But with Ethereum, we have this idea that we can have this shared order book across all these platforms, and this is something that simply wasn't possible before. A shared order book that we don't control and you guys don't control. It's just there for anybody to consume. And that's an incredibly powerful idea and one that really differentiates what we have with ethereum from these web two technologies where we would have to run that.
00:03:46.434 - 00:04:40.146, Speaker A: So I think that's something super important. And then finally, and also really interestingly and something we're starting to see more of, I think especially in the next year, is going to be this idea of the composability of our contract, specifically that other smart contracts could programmatically interact with standard bounties, whether it's creating bounties, creating submissions, accepting submissions, contributing or any of the above. And so those are kind of the three main ideas behind why we started. These kind of have remained generally the same, and we've been experimenting with different pieces of them. But like I said, the aim has always been for it to be a group effort and for other teams to be able to help us towards that end. And so we're excited that we have you guys here who are maybe interested in helping us do that. So with that, I want to launch it to our primary discussion.
00:04:40.146 - 00:05:13.134, Speaker A: I think that's going to be most interesting, which is like the current issues we're facing right now. There's been a number of issues with some of the assumptions that we had there, especially around the ideas. And so I think it's worth discussing some of them. I can initiate the discussion, and then if anyone ever has anything they want to say, just raise your hand or add, hopefully there's not too many people here, so we can just kind of converse in a more natural way. And I'll be taking notes as well. And these will end up being published somewhere. I think we're being reported, too.
00:05:13.134 - 00:06:16.242, Speaker A: So anyone who wasn't here who maybe partied a little too hard last night can still be part of the conversation. With that. I'll start with kind of like the first major issue that I've noticed and that persists to this day, which is around the idea of the interoperability among different platforms. And this is really hard because with bounties in particular, you know, there's different types of action points or features that different platforms will want to add. If a bug bounty platform might require users to perform an additional step or, I know gitcoin, they added the idea of applying for tasks, and then you have to get accepted and then you can. And then this poses an issue for this kind of idea of interoperability because those features are often not built in the context of that contract and therefore those actions can't be made on those other platforms. If that application feature is built in like a web two manner, if that bounty ends up on another platform, users won't apply, they'll just do the work.
00:06:16.242 - 00:07:01.140, Speaker A: And of course, that ends up being, and so one of the challenges that we're face is like, how do we maintain interoperability as time goes on? And it seems like a lot of that comes down to information sharing, but nonetheless, it's like something that's worth noting and discussing because it's, I think, a major hindrance to the idea of teams working together. And then the other one that's also kind of like self evident. But I'll add again is just that it remains very much like not in, when you talk about marketplaces sharing those order books, right. It's kind of not in the best interest of any one of those marketplaces to do that. They're incentivized to maintain their competitive advantage by keeping that data private. Right. And that's why all the web, two companies do that.
00:07:01.140 - 00:07:42.910, Speaker A: And so for us right now, that's still kind of the incentive of all the marketplaces. And there's a reason why bounty Zero X and some of the other bounty related platforms on Ethereum haven't used the standard because they don't want to have this open data. And so that's one of the challenges we face is whether it's relying on intrinsic incentives and having those teams be just like vision align that this is better for our users, we should be doing it or maybe thinking about some extrinsic incentives. It still remains kind of like an open problem. That's worth noting, worth sharing with you guys. And if you guys have any ideas of how that might be solved. Yeah, those are my kind of first few problems.
00:07:42.910 - 00:07:53.470, Speaker A: The things that are kind of on my mind. I want to open the floor. What are the problems you guys know about standard value? Have used it. What are the problems you guys are experiencing?
00:08:05.450 - 00:09:18.400, Speaker B: For example, for the Aragon, we've integrated with it for our Aragon application just for other people that don't know about it. But you can manage this. The way the bounty contract currently works now is you have to transfer tokens into the bounty contract. But what would have been more efficient for our use case is for some of them, it's not Dai or it's not like ether, it's just like your Dow tokens and you decide to mint them on a case by case basis. So for our case, you might want to mint people's tokens after, because as soon as you have tokens that are locked in another contract and these are governance tokens, then that affects your voting form and you kind of don't want that to happen. So what we've done now solve for this is the Aragon token manager app will have a whitelisting feature. Whitelisting where we can add the project app to say any tokens that are earned in the.
00:09:18.400 - 00:09:52.650, Speaker B: But that's going to be the eventual feature where, yeah, you blacklist certain contracts from being considered token holder because right now the standard bounty contract is considered a token holder if someone adds the project stack. But once we build like a blacklisting feature, we can solve that internally within arrow. So that's kind of like on our future roadmap. And we've had user requests for that type of feature because it also affects a few other of our applications.
00:09:53.790 - 00:09:59.366, Speaker A: So I guess the question there is like the tokens would be minted when the work is accepted.
00:09:59.478 - 00:10:24.260, Speaker B: Yeah. And then we also want, the other ideal scenario might be you get die and you get some of the Dow tokens. And I think right now there are, I don't know, I don't know if there are ways. I haven't fully explored this, but as soon as people can still get two types of tokens for completing a task, I don't know, but that's kind of like one of our.
00:10:24.970 - 00:10:54.286, Speaker A: Yeah. To the second question, it's actually really funny. We ran into an issue with web3, like web3 js. And so basically solidity had added 2d arrays into and it was like an experimental feature as part of their experimental API encoder. And neither web3, like web3 js didn't use it and didn't support it. And so we were like just at the time just not able to test it. When we first launched standard minus two.
00:10:54.286 - 00:11:18.982, Speaker A: And so we made this trade off of whether you could have multiple people per submission or you could have multiple tokens per submission. And we decided it made more sense to play with multiple people because collaboration seemed more relevant at the time. At the same time, I think this is a really valuable feature and one we've been thinking about. And so I think, yeah, in the future that's going to be huge.
00:11:19.116 - 00:11:34.358, Speaker B: Kevin, is that something where we could do it where it's non canceled into a contract where you have wind bounty and then that triggers something that might be like one way we can solve it within our platform, but I don't.
00:11:34.374 - 00:11:46.430, Speaker C: Really know we could do that. We would have to modify the token manager further to have a meta controller where you have multiple controllers.
00:11:46.770 - 00:12:15.990, Speaker B: Yeah, there are ways that we can customize error on workaround instead of writing the bounty contract in a way that works with our use case. Like we're doing like all the most efficient way contract meet, like our user. Yeah, we're standing in the way of our user.
00:12:17.210 - 00:12:45.060, Speaker A: Yeah. And it actually takes more time. No, I totally get it. And yeah, it's something that's like that in itself an issue with standards. Take more time and they're necessarily more expensive, which, yeah, so I appreciate you guys. My question with regards to the minting tokens, this is something like I haven't spent time thinking about, so I want to just talk it through. But the first thing that comes to my mind is with regards to the idea of the tokens being there.
00:12:45.060 - 00:13:24.750, Speaker A: I know one of the reasons this is valuable for interesting people is that it kind of gives them more guarantees around money and credit and even just like psychologically speaking, it's like when you're at the market, when you're bartering with somebody, you take the money out of your hand and you're holding it in front of them, you're much more likely to be incentivized to have money than if it's like in your wallet. So I guess my question is, how do you think that interplays with the minting idea? And is there maybe a way to do both at the same time or to at least ensure that people feel the same levels of guarantees about the mintability of the token?
00:13:25.890 - 00:13:35.970, Speaker C: I think it could be considered a special case for non transferable. So if a token is non transferable, doesn't have to be passed.
00:13:43.670 - 00:13:45.810, Speaker B: Won'T the user feel more secure?
00:13:48.310 - 00:13:48.734, Speaker C: Yes.
00:13:48.792 - 00:14:04.460, Speaker B: I guess the question is though, I don't know. Unless you have that, there's no way, even if the tokens are in the balance, I don't think there's any way.
00:14:09.470 - 00:14:56.554, Speaker A: You're right. And, and that would be like a stronger guarantee, which is like, yeah, having a stake claims 1000% and it's like a much weaker addition of trust, basically of trustability, in that they don't know that their submission is going to get accepted, but they can understand and trust that at least the issuer has the money. And whether or not they're honest enough to pay is a different question. But at least we know they're liquid enough to buy. But again, we've never tested that, never tried it. And so I think it might be worth experimenting at least with the idea of not having that. How much does it change in behavior? How much do they really care about that? Because you're right.
00:14:56.554 - 00:15:01.260, Speaker A: Ultimately, if they don't get paid, there's still not really a recourse platform.
00:15:01.970 - 00:15:04.000, Speaker B: Is there a plan to add that?
00:15:04.850 - 00:15:55.626, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's actually a really good segue into the LP discussion. So just to give you guys some background, at some point last year, every time we talk about bounties and we talk about how it works, people are like, oh, so who accepts submissions? And they say, well, the people who create the bounties are the ones who act as the oracles. And they accept submissions because this is kind of the obvious one. And of course in the contract you can have anybody now can be an accepter, you can have an array of them. So you can't have third party oracles, and you can't have this idea of not the issuer or not the creator of a bounty being the one who accepts it. But ultimately it's like an address. And so enough times people ask like, what about if people screw each other over? What are you going to do? And so last year we started building a project that we call Delphi.
00:15:55.626 - 00:16:51.262, Speaker A: And the idea is that it would be like a staking project, social staking. And the idea that each user might have a stake of tokens that they have locked up and that whenever they interact with different counterparties, that those, in the event that they kind of like Renag on any of their responsibilities or don't pay people for their work, that they might be able to open claims against each other and some third party group of arbiters would be kind of voting on those claims. We spent a ton of time on it. Unfortunately, a couple of things happened. One, the bear market kind of forced us to really focus and really buckle down on kind of our core competencies. And two, we kind of realized we're still very early, that we didn't have any of these disputes happening on our website to begin with. And so while it was nice for us to kind of know that eventually this is something, what it will look like, we didn't need it at the time.
00:16:51.262 - 00:17:30.986, Speaker A: And so that code is still open source. It's all available, if you're curious. But nonetheless, we kind of put it on hold for that moment. What's interesting is as of like a week ago, my motivation to rebuild Delphi has gone up significantly. And so this weekend during the typhoon, I'm probably going to rewrite the contract just because, and I'll give you the kind of background for why. A lot of what I've been thinking about at least, is with regards to the Ethereum ecosystem, so many different teams are building these different puzzle pieces, right? For us, one of the puzle pieces is dow teams, and we know that that's useful. And Aragon is dows and the different systems there.
00:17:30.986 - 00:18:03.400, Speaker A: And there's just so many different pieces that need to be put together. And we know that no single team is going to be able to do that and build all of those pieces and put them together, nor should any single team. Right? That's like the Facebook approach, that's why we're doing this in the first place, is to have separate teams doing. But it seems like a lot of the issues around getting people to do that are kind of based on the idea of trust and responsibility and collaboration. And these are social problems. These aren't like, you can't write a protocol to do that. You have to change the way people act.
00:18:03.400 - 00:19:07.286, Speaker A: And so to that end, the idea I have, and I don't know if this is going to work, but the idea that I have is that if we can just start having teams and individuals stake on their values and say, like, we commit to being a drop, you can take our money if you catch us not doing that, or like, we agree to be collaborative, if we stop being collaborative again, you can open claims against us. And so just like having us put our money where our mouths are and say, this is what we stand for, and we're not just saying it, but you can really hold us accountable for that. And in the hopes that other teams might start doing the same thing and that we can maybe lead by example and have different teams in the ecosystem kind of all come together and say, we actually do stand for this, and not in a way that we're going to espouse these values, but not walk the walk, but in a way that's trustworthy enough that you can open claims against us and get a reward if we don't fall through it. So to that end, I am actually going to be building a suit. And so hopefully you guys will hear about it and maybe use it, because I'm sure you guys have values and you guys want to kind of espouse.
00:19:07.318 - 00:19:08.426, Speaker C: From the community as well.
00:19:08.528 - 00:19:27.010, Speaker A: Make sure people kind of recognize you for when we have that. Hopefully that will remove the need for having standard bounty contract, because then you're just kind of opening claims against the Dow itself rather than needing this contract. It becomes this information sharing layer.
00:19:28.070 - 00:20:14.462, Speaker B: It's very interesting because even in Aragon, one aspect of what's being built now is a court which will have arbitration. But the way you like, the way the court is going to work is like an agreement between two parties. There has to be collateral on both sides or something. I wish someone that has been working on support would be, but this way it's more like, these are our values, this is our money file claims against us, and that's much simpler. And it doesn't require the people that are working on account. That's one thing that I was worried about that would work with arbitration because it assumes that people might not have.
00:20:14.596 - 00:20:15.934, Speaker A: They don't have to begin with.
00:20:15.972 - 00:20:39.590, Speaker B: Yeah. The primary use case. That's a great thing about boundaries. People are learning how to code. They want to get into the space. Like, the error might be like, way too complicated. That's for like, crypto projects.
00:20:39.590 - 00:20:50.126, Speaker B: Millions of dollars, thousands of less than thousand dollars. Yeah.
00:20:50.268 - 00:21:27.880, Speaker A: So a couple of things that you said are really interesting. The first one is actually our original Delvi contract did kind of require both sides to stake at some point. Like if you wanted to open a claim, you would have to stake, and then you would get that money back if your claim was right. But that was a requirement. At this point, I want to see if there's a way to make it generally sound from a game theory perspective, but at the same time not require counterparties to do that. But more importantly, this kind of new view I have of staking is like, it's not an agreement necessarily with other people. It's like an agreement you have with yourself, and you're asking other people to just hold you accountable with what you've already agreed with.
00:21:27.880 - 00:22:02.580, Speaker A: The other really interesting thing that I'll talk about. And this actually gets to kind of like the question of who is going to be the arbiter of these claims, right? Like, who is that order? Which is a really tough problem. When we originally were working on Delphi, our idea was that we would use like a TCR of arbiters or plurality token curated registry. And the idea is that you would have a token that could be used by token holders. Would like curate who was. Exactly, yeah, yeah. To curate who is fit to be an arbiter within a certain list.
00:22:02.580 - 00:22:35.242, Speaker A: We stayed with that for a while, and as time went on, I talked to Deanman a lot. He gave me a lot of gripes about why TCR suck and like, plutocratic voting is not a good idea. And eventually I came around and realized like, yeah, he's right. And that this ultimately is not a very good mechanism. What's interesting is like, if you guys know the Claros project, that's kind of what they do. It's not exactly TCR, but it's like token holders are the curators. And I think already, from what I've heard, they've been doing a little bit of arbitration around USWAp or some other exchange.
00:22:35.242 - 00:23:14.570, Speaker A: They're like curating the tokens which can be added to the exchange. Okay. Yeah. And I've heard there have been some questionable rulings on their behalf which tokens can and can't be added just because people are biased and that you can't get unbiased arbitraries that way, where we ended off when we kind of sunseted that research at the moment was actually the idea that for us, right, for bounties, most of the claims people would have would be with regards to a particular bounty, and most bounties are occurring with regards to a particular community. And a community in this case, usually.
00:23:14.640 - 00:23:15.690, Speaker B: Is like a town.
00:23:16.110 - 00:23:35.374, Speaker A: And so the idea that instead of having one global arbiter list for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, rely on the arbiters for that particular community. And if you don't trust that community to come up with their own arbiters and do all the stuff and have them, you probably shouldn't be part of that community. You should just leave and work it.
00:23:35.412 - 00:23:47.730, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. It's kind of like you want to put an extra journal thing. It's like you're filing a lawsuit, but it's like, okay, before you file a lawsuit, you should figure it out amongst themselves. There are steps to how you solve dispute.
00:23:47.810 - 00:23:48.440, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:23:51.130 - 00:23:54.840, Speaker D: If you're just constantly forking, you'll never take down a firearm, for sure.
00:23:55.530 - 00:25:04.646, Speaker A: The other thing that we kind of thought about a lot, and this is like, I mean, maybe it was a bit of a rationalization, but we really like to think this is true, which was that ultimately, in the context of resolving disputes and avoiding disputes, right, that instead of just worrying about, like, okay, we have these disputes and we have to resolve them and you have a stake, whatever, we kind of went, like, upstream and we're like, well, why do people screw each other over in the first place? Right. People, when you go to stay in an Airbnb versus when you're staying at your friend's house, you wouldn't trash your friend's house. But people do trash Airbnbs all the time. And most of the time, the strength of the connection between those two parties dictates how much they're going to screw each other over. And so a lot of our perspective became, okay, well, instead of assuming there's no connection, instead of assuming there's no trust, what if we could try to build a platform that actually builds that trust? How do we create human connection among our users rather than assuming it doesn't exist? And this is really hard, and these are not solved problems, but the closest we've kind of come is trying to get people to realize that they share a lot of the same values, that they actually have a ton in common. Because when you do that, say, oh, you have kids? Oh, I also have a son, blah, blah, blah, oh, he plays soccer. So does mine.
00:25:04.646 - 00:25:26.280, Speaker A: And when you create that connection among people, they start to feel guilt. And guilt is a much stronger incentive mechanism than any extrinsic tokens or staking or anything like that. And so that's like, I mean, for our platform in the short term at least, that's like what we've been thinking about solving. This is like just getting people to feel bad because it's work. We don't really have that many disputes. It's the community.
00:25:27.130 - 00:25:30.360, Speaker D: But again, that doesn't scale because you can get about 100 people.
00:25:34.410 - 00:26:32.490, Speaker A: And this is like, it's funny because at the time, like a year ago almost, we were like, we're not big enough. We don't need this yet, blah, blah, blah. And it's only recently that we started re asking this question of, like, our users are starting to say, I'm afraid I'm going to get scammed, because again, they just don't know each other. And so we're starting to think, okay, are we back at that point where we need to, where we've grown too big for that to still be a fair assumption? My hope is we can still avoid it. A lot of the work we're doing these days is instead of trying to have one global kind of bounties, explorer and registry of bounties, we're thinking about them within the context of the communities. And those communities get to know each other much more and making it easier for that to happen. And so that kind of encourages this tree style scaling, where instead of it just being one group and then having to solve that, you just continuously keep breaking people up into these smaller groups where they can't know each other.
00:26:32.490 - 00:27:11.880, Speaker A: And if you want to do, I mean like a hierarchy in the semantic sense of information, where you have a parent community, which is like graphic design, and then like a subcommunity, which is like illustrations, and then a subcommunity, which is like anime illustrations. And I guess that's a hierarchy of information. And in some ways does actually lead to hierarchies of power, depending on the number of people and the decisions they can make. But I think it's not necessarily that way. And ultimately, in my opinion at least, that kind of tree style scaling is like for computer science. That's the way things scale. And so that's like the perspective I have.
00:27:11.880 - 00:27:15.286, Speaker A: But I can see why the hierarchy would be.
00:27:15.388 - 00:27:48.510, Speaker D: What we're working about on canonizer is it's all about consensus. None of what you're talking about matters. Oda's law doesn't matter. Organizations don't matter, nothing matters. If you can achieve consensus with everybody, you can overwrite anything. So our focus is finding out concisely and quantitatively what everyone wants, and knowing that in real time, and be able to track that in a consensus building way. Today, everything finds the disagreement, everything focuses on that, and people fracture and split into communities.
00:27:48.510 - 00:28:22.070, Speaker D: As long as we do that, we can't get down hierarchy. But at canonizer, we have support camps, where you have a super camp, which is what people agree on. And when you find something disagreeable, it's usually a minor issue, you push that down to a supporting subcamp. So when you join a camp, it's a weekly with camps. But when you join a camp and gain editorial control, and if two people want two different things, you push that out of the way of consensus in the supporting subcamp. So everyone still supports the super camp, and whatever reason for focus stays up there. And the bottom line is you still need to track all those differences in the lower level subcamp.
00:28:22.070 - 00:28:29.374, Speaker D: And by definition, if you know concisely and quantitatively what everyone wants, that consent is. And if you can know consensus at.
00:28:29.412 - 00:28:33.742, Speaker A: A scale, you can take that higher. That's really, really interesting.
00:28:33.796 - 00:28:36.160, Speaker D: Your project is called canonizer.com.
00:28:36.610 - 00:28:49.878, Speaker A: Cool. I'm going to read up on this. This sounds really awesome. And I think, yeah, is a big problem that I've been thinking about with regards to the values. And when you get those disagreements about values, how do you resolve them? And I think that's really awesome, like pushing them down.
00:28:49.964 - 00:29:22.174, Speaker D: And we split the voting and all of that other kind of stuff from the canonization. So when you join a camp, you get control of that camp, so everyone gets a voice, and it's all about consensus. So you have the fewest number of camps possible. But then we have what we call canonizer algorithms that let you canonize the way you want. So today the input is on everything coming in. If you're going to scale, the hierarchy says we only allow that 1% in, and that's the only thing we're going to publish. But canonizer, we flip that upside down.
00:29:22.174 - 00:29:38.920, Speaker D: Everyone uses a canonizer algorithm. That's basically a way for you to select experts that you trust. And you use that canonizer algorithm, it only caps those votes. And you can see 90% of the experts I trust want Prague. And if you can say that, then no more.
00:29:40.170 - 00:29:42.946, Speaker A: You have, and you have the signaling.
00:29:42.978 - 00:30:24.878, Speaker D: Around what people think and signaling the current existing system is all just about voting and disagreement and a one time snapshot, right? The camps got to be about falsifiability. What will it take? You get the camp, say what will falsify your camp? You define the experiment, you do the AV experiment, falsify that camp, and you measure the value of that scientific evidence or argument as to how many people have converted. You can't just signal. You have to measure when people have jumped in camps and why and what it takes. And again, in the canonizer algorithm, the default is one person won vote. That's always terrible because the masses are far behind the experts. So you switch to an expert canonizer algorithm and everything reprioritizes.
00:30:24.878 - 00:31:14.100, Speaker D: That lets the expert find out what the popular consensus leads right now and why, so they can address those issues better and amplify the wisdom of the crowd and gets everyone back on board up to track with experts. But all the bottom line is knowing concisely and quantitative. And I believe the first crypto community learns how to communicate concisely. And quantitatively so you can know real time what everyone wants and everyone believes, not only they'll start kicking down all the hierarchies, because hierarchies are always the guy at the top makes the decision, and everyone does view that huge bottleneck. But at canonizer you have infinite delegation. So hierarchies form on every single topic and so there's no more bothering. So you can scale that finding out what everyone wants and finally start taking down.
00:31:14.630 - 00:31:27.174, Speaker A: That's really cool. And I think it's like the interesting thing there, which the Ethereum community needs to do better, is getting people to realize we all have the same values that we agree on, 95% of it.
00:31:27.212 - 00:31:30.594, Speaker D: Push the disagreement to lower level subjects out of the way of consumer.
00:31:30.642 - 00:31:37.500, Speaker A: Exactly. And it's like if we can do that and continuously remind people that we actually agree on almost all of it.
00:31:37.950 - 00:31:39.498, Speaker D: But you've got to keep track of.
00:31:39.504 - 00:31:40.890, Speaker A: That disagreement too, right?
00:31:41.040 - 00:31:53.550, Speaker D: Because you've got to get both of what everyone. You got to find a creative way, whether it's an intersection, do stoplights, build an overpass, but you've got to track it and know it and monitor it and not abuse the minority guy that wants something different.
00:31:53.620 - 00:31:57.226, Speaker A: Right, little guys, and they need to have a set as well.
00:31:57.268 - 00:32:00.210, Speaker D: And they have to have their camp and they can't be censored.
00:32:00.630 - 00:32:05.170, Speaker A: Have you guys done any experiments or thinking at least around quadratic voting?
00:32:05.590 - 00:32:31.354, Speaker D: We're working on an ether algorithm so people can vote their ether and we're going to have a quadratic version. So your vote is a square root of the amount of ether. So you get small value. So individuals have a lot more vote than people with lots. And that's the thing is you can select, we isolate that so people can program any kind of voting, all the kind of stuff. Token voting, any way you want. You can select whatever canonizer algorithm you want to do.
00:32:31.354 - 00:32:32.300, Speaker D: Any of that.
00:32:33.070 - 00:32:37.662, Speaker A: Canonizer.com. Do you guys have like a white paper, like media post?
00:32:37.716 - 00:32:41.902, Speaker D: Yeah, there's a white paper there on the front page and there's a help page that tells you how to use it.
00:32:41.956 - 00:32:42.318, Speaker A: Beautiful.
00:32:42.404 - 00:32:43.726, Speaker C: There's an introductory video.
00:32:43.828 - 00:32:47.310, Speaker A: I'm going to have to check that out. Maybe I'll read this during checkbox.
00:32:47.730 - 00:32:53.762, Speaker D: Yeah, because what you say, Dan, it all comes out of consensus. If you don't have consensus, none of that will work.
00:32:53.816 - 00:33:05.480, Speaker A: Yeah, and it's funny because the word consensus itself, the way we use it right now, is actually not consensus at all. 51% of people agreeing to something like not actually what the word consensus means.
00:33:06.730 - 00:33:09.154, Speaker D: And they always talk about rough consensus.
00:33:09.202 - 00:33:09.414, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:09.452 - 00:33:11.270, Speaker D: That means ignore what the little guy wants.
00:33:11.340 - 00:33:11.670, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:11.740 - 00:33:13.082, Speaker D: And you got to keep track of that.
00:33:13.136 - 00:33:34.000, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really cool. Any other thoughts that are like velvet to any of the things we've said? Like I said, I know it's like almost eleven. My hope was that this would take as little time as possible, but that we would use as much time as we needed. Any other thoughts around like current issues or what we're looking.
00:33:35.490 - 00:34:35.714, Speaker C: One thing that I noticed is in the drain function, the issuer can claim all of the tokens that are staked. The contributions. Yeah. After hearing just talk about more of the thought behind a lot of the community stuff, I understand now more that you want to build those relationships so that you don't need to enforce the fact that those bounds, those contributions can be returned to the people that contributed them. But I was thinking that when I first came across it, it would make sense to enforce that because then you have more of a crypto economic play where anyone can look at an issue that's up and say hey, I want to see this implemented and not have to worry about the implications of staking a contribution against it. Because right now it's assumed by the issuer and used for other.
00:34:35.832 - 00:34:43.894, Speaker A: So the idea would be that you could put your money in but not have to worry if the submission wasn't accepted then you would get your money back then.
00:34:43.932 - 00:34:51.820, Speaker C: Yeah. So you're not contributing to an issuer directly. You're basically just contributing to seeing something. Getting.
00:34:54.030 - 00:35:35.122, Speaker A: This is kind of like the thinking behind why. So I'll give you guys just some more background in case you're curious. So basically there's a contract or a function in the contract which allows the issuer or the creator or the controller really of the bounty to take all the funds out at any given moment. And the reason for having this function was that at any given moment, if they wanted to, they could civil attack the contract, create a new address, create a submission, accept their own submission and drain the money out that way. And so we said well if it's going to be possible, we might as well make it possible in a simple and easy way. That way everyone can see, hey, they withdrew it. Versus like wait, hold up, why is there all these weird new submissions from new users out of nowhere? And that confusion would just kind of hinder the effort.
00:35:35.122 - 00:36:09.474, Speaker A: And so I guess my question for you is imagining that a third party could contribute and it would only go to the, it's sort of like not under the purview of the issuer. You still sort of need the oracle, right? You need somebody to say, yes, my contribution should indeed go to that person. And the only way to do that is by having each of those contributors be able to be their own oracle if they want. But of course that becomes like really time expensive and gas expensive even because they're always generating transactions. Have you thought out a little bit about how that might get solved or any issues?
00:36:09.672 - 00:36:11.380, Speaker C: Way to put the script on.
00:36:14.550 - 00:36:20.230, Speaker A: Take your time. No, these are just like hard problems. Yeah, they're hard problems. That's why I'm curious. Like a good idea.
00:36:20.380 - 00:36:47.854, Speaker C: Yeah. My thinking behind that was that is something that occurred to me. But if we're able to ensure that that money only goes towards the person who implemented the task, that's like one less thing that a contributor needs to look into. Because obviously you're going to wonder who is able to accept or confirm these things anyway. But that doesn't help answer questions. I don't really have a good answer.
00:36:48.052 - 00:37:04.674, Speaker B: What is when the deadline expires, there's kind of an array of contributor advertising value. Claim your funds and then it makes sure that you're not contributing. That's not possible.
00:37:04.792 - 00:37:43.200, Speaker A: No. So right now, yeah, you can do that. It's just like in the event that even if the deadline doesn't expire or if it does, the issuer can still do that for you. And it kind of really gets into this idea that ultimately when you contribute to somebody's bounty that they create. Thank you guys for joining us. That ultimately you have to trust them and that your money is at their mercy. Whether it's basically because they're the oracle and that instead of trying to assume that we can live in a world where we don't trust them, it's better to face the fact that we trust them, accept that as a premise, and then figure out how to act in spite of that.
00:37:43.200 - 00:38:10.982, Speaker A: But going back to what you said, yeah, you can refund contributions after the deadline. You can't do it before unless the issuer does it for you. The issuer can also trigger refunds. So this is the other thing is that the issuer can, if they're like altruistic, say refund all the contributions, don't send the money to me, send the money back to everybody else. And that also is there. It is possible. We just tried to make it as generalized as possible.
00:38:10.982 - 00:38:42.514, Speaker A: That way, if the issuers are honest, they could be honest. If they're dishonest, they'll be dishonest. In the open, which at least makes it easier for everyone to know they were dishonest and that's the best we could do. But yeah, that problem of you have to trust the oracle and you're kind of at their mercy seems to remain there and one that I think about a lot and trying to get around. But maybe there's some arbitration solution there where the group kind of votes or if they are bad actors, maybe that's when they come in, I'm not sure.
00:38:42.552 - 00:39:14.182, Speaker C: But certainly we've kind of gotten around that as integrators by basically making the contract that we're using to integrate with you guys as the jumping off point for a lot of the functionality within the dow that exists. So basically the function that allows like refunds and whatnot within the Dow.
00:39:14.246 - 00:39:28.946, Speaker A: Right. So everything is controlled by the Dow and so it's not like a user's address that can just do it at any point. Exactly. And in theory, if it's a contract, they can not have the ability to call the drain function, which sort of guarantees that they're, which was something we.
00:39:28.968 - 00:39:45.490, Speaker C: Deliberate over a lot and we went out of our way to ensure that there was no way for alternate arbiters or whatever they're called, people who approvers in addition to this contract.
00:39:45.570 - 00:39:58.586, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really good solution or like better than what we have solution at least because then you can kind of abstract that away and then trust the parent contract. Yeah.
00:39:58.608 - 00:40:03.660, Speaker C: So you can just tell people to figure out a way to arbitrate within their own right.
00:40:05.230 - 00:41:06.130, Speaker B: Not to show Aragon again, but like the use case that you're talking about for the arbitration in the community. That works really well with what we want to do with people getting community tokens too, because then that will become like your whitelist of community arbitrators. Right now, I don't know if there would be mechanism besides just looking at the history of who won the boundaries, but if people actually have the tokens of the Dow, then they first people that we access that we were talking what our roadmap for airline is because like I said, there's like report. But yeah, we want to think of use cases, how you do the internal, whatever conflict resolution before you take it. That's definitely like on our roadmap it builds and maybe it can connect with this other simpler thing that you're going to have this weekend.
00:41:07.910 - 00:41:43.434, Speaker E: About that, it just seems like if you have this sort of Aragon community and they're sort of the issuer of the bounty, then they sort of get to. It seems like if the community is the issuer, that's like a smart contract, essentially, that issue the bounty, and so they can kind of choose who to give the bounty to already. So then if they're also sort of like the court, couldn't they just issue the bounty? And if they choose as a community to not issue the bounty, if you go to them as a court, how is that really different?
00:41:43.552 - 00:42:04.850, Speaker B: Well, what you're saying before is you put a bunch of money in banks and you say, our community has these values, this, that, and that. If we break our rules, then you can take some of the money that's in this other pot here separate from the bounty, but it's probably the capital that it's greater than any one single who's the oracle.
00:42:06.150 - 00:42:07.334, Speaker A: But it's like if you use the.
00:42:07.372 - 00:42:10.520, Speaker E: Aragon court, then it's like separate from the community.
00:42:13.050 - 00:42:57.880, Speaker B: That's the first step, is the community members. They resolve it. So you track who has been accepting, who has been working on bounties. You build this relationship with the community and then the people who have been earning the bounties, because it's probably not just, like, one person that's working for that community. So it's like all the people that are working on the tasks will be the ones that can resolve things because you just have to use your human relationships first. Not that we're all random Ethereum addresses claiming bounties. That's just not how it will work, at least in the context of a Dow, I'm not sure, in the context of all illustrators or doing it based on expertise, because those people, they might not know each other as well if you're working as, like, burning out.
00:42:57.880 - 00:43:02.550, Speaker B: I want to go get the Amir coffee.
00:43:06.010 - 00:43:06.374, Speaker C: Yes.
00:43:06.412 - 00:43:08.840, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Thank you for joining us.
00:43:10.510 - 00:43:12.954, Speaker A: Do you want to go ahead? Sure. I was late to center.
00:43:12.992 - 00:43:16.780, Speaker C: Not to talk about this, but is it a problem with using.
00:43:20.110 - 00:43:22.106, Speaker A: They don't have the contact for the.
00:43:22.128 - 00:43:36.586, Speaker C: Committee, or are there other issues with just using them because it feels like they're intended to solve the sort of issue about the question of if the secretary was adding.
00:43:36.698 - 00:44:27.658, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think the context is, like, part of the issue. I think they're trying to solve that issue. With regards to having specific subgroups within Claris, which are specialists in different areas, I think my main issue with Clara stems more around the nature of how that list of arbiters is derived in that it's like, plutocratic can and they have some randomness, which helps to avoid it. But ultimately, you can still civil attacks, so to speak, with your money. And then that's just not a sound mechanism. We know that plutocratic voting is just really not good and leads to a lot of really big issues. Vitalik wrote about this like three years ago, and people are still doing know.
00:44:27.658 - 00:45:10.410, Speaker A: I've shared this with them and they kind of seem fairly steadfast in proving it out. And so maybe vitality's wrong and that does happen, I'm sure, sometimes. But, yeah, my main issue is with the plutocratic nature of how they derive that. To your point, I think it's like a really interesting question. I thought about it like a tiny, tiny bit. And so I'll give you what my gut tells me, which might be the wrong answer, but it seems to me that any dow for that dao, for you to be able to open things against the Dow, that dow needs to be part of a parent community of a dao of Daos, so to speak, and that dao of Daos would be the arbiters. And so let's say there's like the Aragon community, right? An Aragon community posts a bounty.
00:45:10.410 - 00:45:50.410, Speaker A: They don't accept my submission. And I say, well, the Aragon community is lying to me. I would go to the Dao of Daos, which manages the reputation of the entire group, whose incentive it is to maintain their parent organization kind of reputation, and they wouldn't have their own arbiter lists. And so the key is you sort of go one step up the tree for any, whether it's an individual, you go to your community. If it's a community, go to their parent community and you kind of trust them to resolve it. Claros is kind of like the parent communities or trying to be like the parent communities of all parents by using plutocratic kind of mechanisms to get a membership list. I think you get a membership list with curation, practically speaking.
00:45:50.410 - 00:46:06.690, Speaker A: But by having the in group curate itself where that dow of like would itself curate. Okay, well, eight out of nine of us think Aragon no longer espouses our values. They don't align with us. We're going to kick them out of this dow of like.
00:46:06.760 - 00:46:17.970, Speaker E: Would the mechanism be different in terms of the resolution process, but it would just be using the token of the holders of the Dao of Daos instead of the Claros token, or would there be a different process?
00:46:18.120 - 00:46:52.942, Speaker A: So I think the key is for Claros. Maybe this has changed. This is based on my best understanding. I know Claros. The way they've come up with a list of arbiters is that token holders vote, you apply to be an arbiter, and then token holders vote on whether or not you should be accepted within the list. My view on curation is that instead of having token holders vote on the list, you should have the list vote on itself, and that people who are arbiters within the list will say, this new arbiter applied. Do we think he agrees or she agrees with what we.
00:46:52.942 - 00:46:54.786, Speaker A: I don't think that's how Claros works.
00:46:54.888 - 00:47:13.522, Speaker E: Just Claros works that you have like a Claros token and then basically you sort of stake that, right? You basically lock it up and then you're given based on the amount you've staked, then you get sort of a proportional chance of being selected to a court.
00:47:13.586 - 00:47:18.054, Speaker A: Is there no curation mechanism for who can stake them to begin with? It's open.
00:47:18.092 - 00:47:27.110, Speaker E: Like, anybody can buy these Claros tokens, and then based on the percent, like the amount of Claros tokens you have, that's your percentage of being selected as a jury member.
00:47:27.190 - 00:47:33.578, Speaker A: Sure. And that's it. There's no curation. They're using it to curate lists.
00:47:33.754 - 00:47:39.194, Speaker E: But yeah, there's no curation to be like a juror. Anybody can just go and be a juror.
00:47:39.322 - 00:47:41.120, Speaker A: That's like even worse than I thought.
00:47:43.810 - 00:47:46.270, Speaker D: So who determines that they lose their stake?
00:47:46.350 - 00:47:59.286, Speaker E: So it's an economic game where it's like supposedly the jurors are chosen at random and don't know each other, and if they vote against the majority decision, then the total stake gets taken away.
00:47:59.388 - 00:48:01.270, Speaker D: So if they're not in the majority.
00:48:01.930 - 00:48:19.402, Speaker E: Basically it's sort of this economic. Okay, you look at the evidence and you go, what do I believe everybody is going to vote for when they do, like a reveal? And so you're sort of incentivized to vote honestly or you lose your money.
00:48:19.536 - 00:48:21.574, Speaker A: That assumes that the majority is already honest.
00:48:21.632 - 00:48:27.806, Speaker D: I know oftentimes majority isn't right, and I'm some new minority guy, so I'm.
00:48:27.828 - 00:48:32.046, Speaker A: Not going to stake it. Definitely has some issues like you bring.
00:48:32.068 - 00:48:43.842, Speaker E: Up in terms of like, you're voting for what you believe is like the popular opinion, not necessarily to your heart, because there is this economic game also.
00:48:43.896 - 00:49:16.000, Speaker A: Just like what worries me about it the most is like the richest person wins, the richest person has the most share of votes. And do you want to live in the world where the richest people in our world determine what is right or wrong? I certainly don't. And isn't that why we're here in the first place? Yeah, that's a little worrisome to me. Maybe they're right, maybe they're onto something. But I think as time goes on, people will start to realize, like, wait, that probably doesn't make as much sense.
00:49:17.490 - 00:49:42.306, Speaker E: Obviously it's very interesting if you can get civil resistance identity or this type of thing. But even if you sort of have a community in a Dow, at the end of the day, you're going to have token holders in that dow. And you might have sort of like some rich token holders in that dow. And would they not in any sort of sweet resolution process be like a higher weight if they have more of these dow tokens?
00:49:42.338 - 00:50:16.046, Speaker A: Essentially. So this is kind of what I mentioned earlier about the idea of dows curating themselves. For instance, you look at Molokdow. When you want to join Molokdao and buy the tokens, you have to apply to buy the tokens and you have to apply to join. And so that can itself be a civil resistance mechanism whereby any dow is like, this is a list of people we know are real people and you have to apply to become one of them. You can't just buy the token on the open market and that gives you membership. No, you have to try to enter and that group determines whether or not you are a real person.
00:50:16.046 - 00:50:47.450, Speaker A: And so from that you can have different people, can have different amounts of tokens, but that can be independent of whether or not they're on a membership list and have been civil verified. And if they are civil verified as real people, practically speaking, within some context, that is a civil resistant list. And so it's like civil resistant lists curating themselves from a community level to me at least, seems like a better way of doing it then, because then at that point you don't need to worry about plug receive. You kind of like solve civil resistance.
00:50:48.190 - 00:51:01.050, Speaker E: Yeah, just think you would just do like a private vote in terms of anybody who's on the list can just vote and you just keep it private and then you reveal and then that's the decision.
00:51:01.130 - 00:51:35.974, Speaker A: Exactly. I mean, you can do, there's like interesting stuff around the voting, the actual steps. Having a commit and then a reveal is good, but then at the same time you want to have information sharing and you want to incentivize people to share their ideas early. And this is actually some weird thing we experimented with. Delphi was like, you commit, and then the order in which you commit determines how much you get. But it's like this weird recursive way of getting the payout. So it's like, first I would get, like one over n of the total reward, and then the next person would get one over n of the remainder, and so on and so forth.
00:51:35.974 - 00:52:13.554, Speaker A: And what n is would have to depend on how many hours you expect to have voting on that thing. But ultimately the result would be that after I voted, after I've committed my vote, it's in my best interest to share why I voted the way I did, even before I reveal. And so, because you do ultimately want people sharing their different perspectives, people are wrong sometimes. They don't have perfect information. We should assume that. And so having the whole point of having a group vote, the whole point of why we call the Delphi, was what it's called, like the Delphi method. The Delphi method is like something that's existed for 20 or 30 or 40 years, and it's actually a way that companies do finance forecasting.
00:52:13.554 - 00:53:03.862, Speaker A: Basically, you get like a group of experts, they independently come up with their own ideas, they come together, they share those ideas, and then they go separate again, and then they vote. But the key is they did an initial vote, they came to their own ideas, then they come together and share why they thought that, and then they separate. And that's like a really interesting tool for the actual process of the vote. But with regards to who can be a voter, I think those self curating groups, and then just having within those groups, people opt in. Right? Like, if I'm one of the arbiters, but there's some arbitration lawsuit or something about maritime law, and I'm an expert in corporate law, but I don't know shit about maritime law, I will opt out to do that because I know if I rule incorrectly, and my peers within that group. See, hey, Mark keeps voting on things we know he doesn't know anything about. He knows he doesn't know anything about.
00:53:03.862 - 00:53:34.986, Speaker A: We're going to kick him out. And so it's like you have the group curating itself and constantly getting rid of viruses, people, really. And that opt in idea of where people only they opt in to do the things they know they're good at. To me, seems like a pretty okay solution. If it's civil, resistant is at least not TCR. No. So it wouldn't even have to be a TCR, right? Like, this was actually Dean eineman curated registry.
00:53:34.986 - 00:54:01.414, Speaker A: Yeah, this is what Dean Eineman suggested. He hated TCR so much, he's like, stop doing this. Because TCRs assume that token holders curate lists. And what he said and what we were talking about is like, lists curating themselves. And that if you guys ever watch the tv show survivor, right, you have the tribe votes and you are no longer in our tribe. Like, you've been voted out of the tribe. And it's that idea of, like, the group decides whether who stays, who enters into that group, and who leaves.
00:54:01.414 - 00:54:13.418, Speaker A: It's not some third party group of people who have a lot of money or who hold governance tokens or anything. It's like we are the group. We decide who is in our group, whether it's admitting new people or kicking people out.
00:54:13.504 - 00:54:15.050, Speaker D: One person, one vote.
00:54:15.390 - 00:54:41.698, Speaker A: You could have one person, one vote? Yeah, you could have, like, based on the amount of time you've been in the community, you might be able to get more votes. There's tons of different mechanisms you could experiment with. But when you have, because the key is that list just becomes like a civil, resistant list of membership, then you could do, like, one person, one vote, you could do. Based on your history of how often you vote, maybe you should get more votes because you're like an active voter. Maybe you don't want that. Maybe you want to disincentivize. There's so much experimentation.
00:54:41.698 - 00:55:44.378, Speaker A: I don't know the right answer. But the key, the cool part is the civil resistant list, because then you don't have to worry about the token balances or anything. You can start to know that these are real people and the group knows that they're real people. And if the group starts letting in fake people, they know that the integrity of their group goes away. I think this gets into a really interesting point of how we see high quality people in the world come together, is that they sort of coagulate together, high quality people who want to be around other high quality people, and they will do the work it takes to make sure that the only people they hang out with or spend their time with are other smart or talented people. They don't want to be associated with people who are crappy. And this is one of the big problems with TCRS was like, if you were like a restaurant on the TCR of restaurants, another crappy restaurant could be promoted above you by the token holders and by association because you were on the same list together, your reputation might go down, because the TCR's reputation goes down and you were on that would like, and it would drag you down.
00:55:44.378 - 00:56:19.960, Speaker A: But alternatively, if those restaurants on that list were the ones curating it, if the restaurants decided among themselves which was the best restaurant, you don't have to worry about food critics coming in and tasting your food, whatever. The restaurants themselves know who is the best. And I think at least that's a much better path than this, buddy, again, like we haven't experimented with it, we haven't had the time yet. I'm hoping maybe Claros will realize maybe they were a little wrong and we'll try to experiment that way eventually, if they have time. Those are my thoughts on that.
00:56:20.410 - 00:56:52.750, Speaker D: When you think about what makes an arbiter, what is an arbiter, and that's people who trust. So that's what we formalize the canonizer by, infinite delegations. So when you come to a topic, my kids can delegate to me, I can delegate to my friend who knows more than me, my friend knows world class expert. So you get these high trees, so infinite delegation, but it's also real time. So Vitalik gets this huge tree. But if Vitalik ever speeds up, everyone can infinitely jump to something, right? We just have to formalize.
00:56:56.070 - 00:57:02.610, Speaker A: And then it becomes really expensive to do on chain. I don't know. I assume.
00:57:05.030 - 00:57:41.774, Speaker D: You do all of the content spilling and everything off chain. Then you can use chain and then that becomes oracle to drive the stuff on the chain because the chain can say we're going to use this particular canonizer algorithm to make the decision. And so everyone joins and makes all these trees, and we're going to use quadratic ether voting. And so that gives the people of the tree, the small people, as much vote as people. And then you determine a time, xyz time. We're going to make this decision. So you're watching the tree form and everything, and someone screws up right before, so everyone changes to another person.
00:57:41.774 - 00:57:57.860, Speaker D: The vote happens using the desired canonizer algorithm, whatever it is, both at home, whatever you, and then that becomes oracle. And that becomes, that becomes Oracle drive.
00:58:01.690 - 00:58:22.618, Speaker A: Any other thoughts? It's now 1117. The sun is shining up there. Seems like our conversation has come to like a natural conclusion. Thank you guys for coming. It's been a pleasure to have you guys. I don't know a lot of your faces here. I'm Mark, if you've seen around the conference, I love talking about this stuff, as you guys can tell.
00:58:22.618 - 00:58:40.000, Speaker A: If you have any ideas of what we should be working on, what you guys want to work on, and maybe we can help. Whether I work at consensus, consensus is great. They fund our project and so if you guys need funding for your project, maybe I can help give some advice on how you can get that. But yeah, thank you guys for coming.
