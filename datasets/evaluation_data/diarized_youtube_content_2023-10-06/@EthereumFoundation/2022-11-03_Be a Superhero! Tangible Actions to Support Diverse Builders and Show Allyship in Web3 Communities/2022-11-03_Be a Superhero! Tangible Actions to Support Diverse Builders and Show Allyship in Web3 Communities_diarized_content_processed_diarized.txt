00:00:12.490 - 00:01:09.154, Speaker A: Okay, so in this workshop, I'm going to start with some definitions, and definitions will help kind of frame the conversation. If by any chance you are triggered by any of the conversation that we're having today, I do have an ally here that is trained in helping you. So if you want to have a conversation, lowe, if you want to raise your hand, lowe is available to you for a resource. If you want to use her, feel free to give her a talk. So after these definitions, we'll go ahead and talk about why DNI is important in web three, and then we'll go on to a couple of different activities. Okay, so for definitions, the first definition that we want to kind of think about is what is called privilege. And privilege is understanding a difference within power and understanding that there are some ways where you naturally have power or privilege in a situation where another group will not have power.
00:01:09.154 - 00:01:30.950, Speaker A: And usually the group that has the power is the privileged group. And the group that does not have the power is called the Oppressed group. These forces and powers can be racially divided. It can be gender divided. Here at DevCon, the privileged groups are can you think of a privileged group to hear at DevCon? White men. That might work. Okay.
00:01:30.950 - 00:01:39.350, Speaker A: What else would be a privileged group here at DevCon? CIS guys. Okay. VCs. Okay. Rich people. Okay. What else would be a privilege?
00:01:39.890 - 00:01:40.618, Speaker B: Passports.
00:01:40.714 - 00:02:08.246, Speaker A: Good. Passports. That would be one. What else would be a privilege? How about speaking English first? Language is a privilege, right? So you have all of this. How about physical abilities going up and down the stairs? There are a lot of different ways. If you're someone who might be neuro atypical this is a very overstimulating place, you might have privilege on that aspect. So there's a lot of aspects of privilege that are in play all the time around us.
00:02:08.246 - 00:03:12.410, Speaker A: And so that's something that we might just want to be aware of, is where your privilege is coming through. After privilege, we have bias. Does anyone know what bias is? Biases are like the way that our kind of almost unconscious privileges kind of show up, per se. So one of the things that I would definitely encourage you to do is there is a Harvard Implicit Bias Test, and one of the ways it shows up within our workplace is, like, holidays, right? So everyone knows we get Christmas and New Year's off, which is great, but it's also religious bias because it's not just Christians that have celebrations throughout the year. So you can take the Harvard Implicit Bias Test to just kind of know where your biases are showing up. And it's important to know where your biases show up so that when you create policies or procedures, you're just aware of where your biases are. If you're aware of your biases, you're trying to not intentionally do harm and being aware of your biases are those steps.
00:03:12.410 - 00:03:30.080, Speaker A: Does anyone know where biases show up within workplaces? It shows up a lot. One of the biases that shows up a lot within web two and web three is college degrees or undergrad backgrounds that kind of also will have biases as well.
00:03:30.530 - 00:03:31.630, Speaker B: Alcohol.
00:03:35.670 - 00:04:29.038, Speaker A: That's a bias for sure. Anyone else? Okay, so when we talk about biases and privileges, we start to realize that there is that definition between the power struggles that happen and that if you want to try to leverage and make it level for everybody, then you need to have an ally. And an ally is someone who recognizes like, hey, there is a power indifference and I'm going to fight and I want for that power to be removed so that you have a just world just as much as I do. So that is what's called an ally. And sometimes you'll hear, like, if you're around me, I'll say, like, oh, I need an ally. Which means I need someone who is not like me, who has that power to use their power in a way that benefits the situation and leverages the injustice of power that I would have or the other person who, without power, has. But a step beyond allies is actually called accomplice.
00:04:29.038 - 00:05:26.166, Speaker A: And that's what I would really want you all to be an accomplice is someone who says, yes, you do have a power indifference and I'm going to level it and use all my power to level it as much as I'm going to be in the trenches with you as we move this forward. And so there's one aspect where you're recognizing like, oh, there is a power indifference and it's not really fair and I hope that works out for you. And then there's a difference with hey, there is a power indifference that's not really fair. I'm going to do everything I can to justify that power indifference and that's where I hope we all become in this space. So why is it important in web three? These are generally over the top issues that we kind of think about. One of the things is like 30 racially diverse teams perform 35% better than non racially diverse teams. So if you want to easily have a better performing team, have diversity on your team, that's like one of the easiest way to do it.
00:05:26.166 - 00:06:17.266, Speaker A: Again, teams where women and men earn equally will actually have 41% higher revenue generated for the organization. So if your wants to easily make more money, have equally diverse teams from a gender perspective, don't have a gender pay gap would be another way to do it. But the key reasons that these are important to web three are the actual ethos of web three. So when you think of decentralization, you think of identity, you think of plurality all of the time. We talk about this from a technical perspective, but this is also like a human perspective. So when you think of decentralization, we always talk about nodes having all these nodes decentralized. But if we're starting to create systems and procedures, you really want to have decentralization of thought as well.
00:06:17.266 - 00:07:52.898, Speaker A: And so sometimes when we start to think of decentralization of thought or how are people decentralized, we kind of centralize as well here in your mind, I want you to think of an event, right? And you're going to take five people to that event, your best five people, right? Close your eyes, think about it. Who are the five people you're going to take mentally to think about them? What are their ages? Where do they live? Where do they go to school? What gender are they? Are you yourself centralizing around any one of those? Or do you have a diverse group around you making that decision? So as you make a decision, are you decentralizing itself and making a decision that has a voice of a lot of people? Are you making an assumption for people that are centralized along one of those verticals? Decentralization helps. You have a lot of people thinking about the best way to attack a problem and the best way to move forward. So the more that we can say is this decentralized as far as we're making people processes, or is this decentralized from a Web Three perspective, you also want different types of people building different types of things from different types of perspectives and that helps be a stronger network. That to me also reminds me of plurality where we say like, hey, it's not trying to have one team make it. We all get stronger when everyone gets stronger. And that ethos applies towards different types of peoples as well.
00:07:52.898 - 00:09:08.826, Speaker A: So when you start to understand different Web Three ethos, you can apply them to technology, you can apply them to software, but you can also apply them to peoples and people's needs. So even if it's difficult for you to understand, like I don't understand an Asian male's perspective, but I can fight for them because I believe in plurality that might be a way to fight for the underdog per se. So we think about this I also think about this as being extremely important from an identity perspective in Web Three, because in Web Three a lot of us are known through our ENS domains or our Lens protocol domains or whatever you're using and our NFTs. So you could be interacting with a person's image in an ETH domain and not really know the person behind it per se. And so you kind of just have to be realizing that that person might be going through a lot of different things, but you don't even know what that person is going through. So the more that you can advocate holistically across the board for all different types of people, the better it can be. And when you start to minimalize groups or think like oh, there's not someone with an LGBT background within our group, so we don't have to worry about it.
00:09:08.826 - 00:09:48.874, Speaker A: That may or may not be true because you don't know someone beyond, again, an NFT in an ETH domain. So the more that we can create better policies for everyone, the better off we can be or at least be accomplices to people, the better off we will be. Okay, cool. So here's the meat and potatoes of it. We're going to talk about how can you be a hero? And for me, a hero is anybody who can also be an accomplice. I thought I would be really cutesy and get like a little superhero costume, and then I forgot this was around Halloween and we were also about so we're going to just be our own heroes, and that will be fine today. Okay, so there's this concept of holding space.
00:09:48.874 - 00:10:36.758, Speaker A: And a holding space can be having a meeting group to hold space. It can be holding an opportunity for certain groups to learn together. Holding space can be changing the panels on the boards or holding space on a board or a panel for someone that is coming from that oppressed group and holding space for them. But it can also be opportunities to hold space for a cohort to learn a technology. It can be being intentional about your public facing things, having specific cohorts for learning. So instead of having everybody thinking that everybody enters the room the same way, having specific targeted spaces for marginalized communities to learn that technology. So if you're going to I'm going to use Shifi, because Shifi is here.
00:10:36.758 - 00:11:27.282, Speaker A: And let's say you wanted to have a workshop that was open to building on Lens protocol. It would be just specifically for the Shifi community to learn and realizing that that community learns in a different way than the general population would be learning and creating a safe space for them. So holding safe space is extremely important when you're dealing with marginalized groups because it recognizes that just by stepping in the room, there are power dynamics that are in play. All right, environmental safety. This one is a huge one this week for me here. So one of the things that we have talked about in the past is, like the importance of having a code of conduct and having procedures that actually follow those code of conducts. The reason why code of conducts are important is because as people, again, we have biases.
00:11:27.282 - 00:12:06.290, Speaker A: And the code of conduct is supposed to be the guidance and policies and procedures that are put in place to mitigate those biases or to be in place regardless of the biases. So it's the steps that we take in order for things to happen. Those steps mean nothing if we don't take them. So having the code of conduct or seeing that there is a code of conduct is helpful, but you need to also be enforcing code of conduct, too. Being aware of microaggressions. Does anyone know what a microaggression is? Would it be helpful for me to explain it? Yes. Lori, you want to explain it? Go ahead.
00:12:06.440 - 00:12:06.850, Speaker B: Sure.
00:12:06.920 - 00:12:08.130, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:12:08.200 - 00:12:48.766, Speaker B: A microaggression is like something that is like a small act that adds up to a feeling of oppression over time. For me, as a woman, someone might, at work, compliment me on my outfit or on my appearance, and that happens to women a lot. And even though it's nice to say, hey, you look good today, but the fact that as a woman, that's what people always think of you, that's like a microaggression. It might seem nice, but in the grander perspective of things, it's like adding to the fact that you're seen as like a one dimensional identity.
00:12:48.878 - 00:12:51.714, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, cool. Yes.
00:12:51.912 - 00:12:56.698, Speaker C: Can it be also aggressive behavior?
00:12:56.894 - 00:12:59.960, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you give me an example of what you would think?
00:13:00.330 - 00:13:27.998, Speaker C: For example, when you are trying to tell someone something that it's supposed to be looking like it's something not good, like this example that she did, but instead you are telling a person something that is good for them, but you are not doing in a happy way. You are being aggressive, but you are saying something that is good for me.
00:13:28.084 - 00:14:02.422, Speaker A: Yeah, I can only speak yes. So I can think of some of the microaggressions that I get. And I think for someone, for me, I get like, you speak so well, which seems like a compliment, but really when you flip it around, it's actually a microaggression. Because there's an assumption that I wouldn't speak well, that there's a certain group of people that shouldn't speak well. Or that vernacular of being well spoken only resolves it. Or that even being well spoken says something about someone where not being well spoken doesn't. And it's not really that same.
00:14:02.422 - 00:14:52.430, Speaker A: So just being aware of the different power dynamics is really helpful there. But, yeah, there's a lot of different microaggressions. The main thing that if I could give you a takeaway from environmental safety is when something is unsafe for someone, a, you believe them that it's unsafe, and B, you speak up, especially if you're in the group that has the most power, speaking up is the most important thing that you can do at that moment. Okay, so another step for being a hero is to remove, reflect, and retain. And these are like, removing unnecessarily biased language from job descriptions helped. This is a big thing in web two or web three. Removed based biased requirements for jobs such as grade level background, different types of location preferences can also be like that or any type of vague requirements.
00:14:52.430 - 00:15:50.824, Speaker A: So one of the ways that that had came up before was like, we used to have a hiring bar for engineers, and it'd be like, oh, this person types slow and so they shouldn't be onboarded. But then we had someone else that typed slow and was onboarded. So we were like, well, what is type slow? What does that mean? And why does it even matter when you're trying to interview for engineering? And so you had to be very defined with what are your actual requirements for the roles? Do you see anything here that would be considered exclusive or maybe an unnecessary barrier? And I'll say background. Again, this is for, like, a software engineering role, but does anyone want to share what they see would be an unnecessary barrier? Sure. I'm sorry. What degree? Degree in those backgrounds. Okay.
00:15:51.022 - 00:15:55.550, Speaker C: Interesting project is quite subjective, so they can choose whatever they want.
00:15:57.520 - 00:16:03.608, Speaker A: All right, exactly. Anything else from track record assumes you.
00:16:03.634 - 00:16:22.884, Speaker C: Have some kind of continuity in your life that has a record to it. All right, adaptability. I don't like understanding that you can get that little preferred line of work on the one that you actually signed up for that company and where your passion plan?
00:16:23.002 - 00:16:53.308, Speaker A: Yeah, let's see if there's anything else there. I also think, like, building the right tools for the system. I'm like, well, what's the right tools? That seems very subjective as well. Okay, so this is a little bit more of an inclusive statement, or they're trying to be a little bit more inclusive. Is there any type of inclusive statement there that stands out to you? Well, I can compare to the other one.
00:16:53.474 - 00:16:55.516, Speaker B: If this is the job requirements section.
00:16:55.628 - 00:17:03.410, Speaker A: The header was what excites US? Versus you have it's more direct, it's more clear. Awesome. Anyone else?
00:17:07.630 - 00:17:18.782, Speaker C: Yeah, it's more about your enthusiasm, the mission, who you are, where you believe in rather than things you've actually had the privilege of working on in the past.
00:17:18.916 - 00:17:19.600, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:21.890 - 00:17:24.000, Speaker B: And then I wonder what we mentioned.
00:17:27.730 - 00:17:30.046, Speaker A: All right, I feel like this one's.
00:17:30.078 - 00:17:53.030, Speaker B: Like your qualities, not your qualifications. And even though the last one, those qualifications are probably trying to just be a signal of these same qualities, like, oh, you've worked on lots of interesting projects in internships and whatnot. Well, not everybody has that privilege, but they could still arrive to the same excitement, experience, strong skills.
00:17:53.110 - 00:17:55.580, Speaker A: Yeah. Hold on.
00:17:57.870 - 00:18:02.080, Speaker B: Developing production software is a little bit more specific than.
00:18:05.010 - 00:18:05.760, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:07.010 - 00:18:23.874, Speaker B: I would say this job description is more inclusive because it encourages a grander range of people to apply, whereas the other one was more specific in ways that might be discouraging and just maybe encourage exclusivity, which is just maybe not.
00:18:23.912 - 00:18:24.500, Speaker C: What?
00:18:24.810 - 00:18:25.560, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:26.970 - 00:18:49.702, Speaker C: Also think that if I were to read both of those examples, even if I wasn't a fit for either of them, the brand attribution of me being positively aligned to this brand versus the other one, I would leave with a better sense of wanting to work with this organization versus the previous one for future consults.
00:18:49.766 - 00:19:46.494, Speaker A: Nice. There was a mention about requirements and the list of requirements, and I just wanted to highlight one thing when it comes to requirements and how it's perceived by different types of gender. Specifically here, when it comes to men, men will see the list of requirements and meet 30% of them and apply for the job. And women will see the list of requirements and apply for the job after they've met 70% of the requirements. So there is a section of self weeding out that's happening when it comes to requirements, if you're just listing requirements and not being inclusive right from the get go. So if you're thinking about why don't we have more women in our, you might want to start by looking at how are you listing what you want to come into the itself. I feel like this is probably my favorite job posting because there's always those times when we've seen companies that we're like, yes, I want to work there, I could bring this, we could do this.
00:19:46.494 - 00:20:21.530, Speaker A: But it doesn't fit into what they have listed into a job requirement. And this is kind of like an open door of like, well, you tell us what you can bring to the table, what you see missing in our and how you are a good fit. And I think that that happens to be a lot of a thing that will open up some doors. You okay, now we get to reflect. And reflect sometimes comes in reporting. It can come in roles, it can become responsibilities and transparency. So this actually was a Web Three statement that came out and it was like super applauded, which is cool.
00:20:21.530 - 00:20:36.320, Speaker A: And it's like, yay, they're building more inclusive financial systems and they're happy to report that there's 50% more or 50 50 parity at the location. But I didn't know if any of you all saw any problems with this.
00:20:40.690 - 00:20:41.402, Speaker B: World.
00:20:41.556 - 00:20:45.700, Speaker A: Okay, that's good. Yes.
00:20:54.090 - 00:21:04.600, Speaker B: Maybe 50%. All of the men are in the upper position for the engineers or whatever, and the women have the lower EA or something like that. It doesn't show.
00:21:07.050 - 00:21:38.578, Speaker A: Anyone else what does that graph. Thank you. I was like, there's no legend. Yeah, that was really all of it. And I honestly am like, I don't think anyone's doing great, so I'm really not keen to give anyone a pat on the back, but I really don't like people giving themselves a pat in the back. So I think the sense is, like, we can always go better also by saying like, yeah, we're at 50 50 parity with women to men. It really doesn't show racial breakdown within the women.
00:21:38.578 - 00:22:28.530, Speaker A: So there still could be a lot of power dynamics that were at play there too. So I had a lot of issues with this one specifically, but I had done reporting back when I was at Square back in the day. And so I'll share a little bit of our pitfalls that we had too. I'm not a huge fan of reporting odly enough because I feel like it reduces people back down to numbers and it doesn't really give us a whole perspective of the health of the organization itself. It also was really difficult when we followed the actual guide on how to report your numbers. It didn't deal with any type of intersectionality. So if you were dealing with racial reporting, if you're a mixed person, you had to choose one side, you had to choose one side of your identity and it wasn't very truly reflective.
00:22:28.530 - 00:23:12.154, Speaker A: It's not super inclusive and it puts a lot of focus on diversity, but it doesn't put a lot of focus on belonging or any type of things of that nature too. And it only focuses on numbers and matrixes, which is like the worst thing that you can do. It's not really reflective. So other than that we tried to do like DNI, OKRs or priorities and try to look at it from a holistic level of how can we kind of embrace it from an OKR level and what are going to be our priorities for that year. And if you can do it that way, you can keep the focus on removing barriers and that is like what you're tied to. Okay, Odly, enough. I think this is the most important piece of DNI.
00:23:12.154 - 00:24:13.714, Speaker A: We always talk about recruitment, recruitment, recruitment, but a lot of discussions never talked about why certain groups are leaving and that is usually the bigger question. So yes, you can attract as many different types of people to your but if they're leaving right away or not having a great time, I think it's more important for you to figure out why that is. And it might be like a toxic place to work or a place where you could make it people more comfortable. So in the web three space, I think we do a great not even great, we do a job of attracting people. There are orgs that do a great job of attracting people too, but it's onto us to also figure out how we retain them and empower them in the space to do the work that they want to do. So retention can be double checking salary levels, it can be transparency with salary compensation, it can be looking at different policies and seeing if the policies actually empower different community groups. If you have maternity leave and don't have paternity leave, that could be a problem just looking at a lot of the policies you have in place.
00:24:13.714 - 00:24:56.670, Speaker A: If you have questions about policy, actually Loey is really good. She was on our people team at Getcoin and she was really good at trying to kind of go through a fine tooth comb with our policies and seeing if it's as inclusive as it could be. Okay, so now that we got through the R and Heroes, we're going to go with O and thinking. O is thinking outside of the box a lot of times within web three or within web two even, we talk about like, oh, there's no X, Y and Z type of people in the it's because we can't find them. And then you're only looking within your own network and you're not going outside of the box. Go outside the box, think of new solutions. Ask different types of people, recruit from nontraditional places, nontraditional schools.
00:24:56.670 - 00:25:29.514, Speaker A: Whatever was not working for you before was not obviously working. So try something new. It's always fine. Find the people where they are. There's lots of orgs that have women engineers, women in crypto, women in Stem Black and Stem Black and crypto. There are all these different orgs out there that are different groups, marginalized are empowered in, and you can go engage with those groups, fund those groups and work with those groups in order to not only again attract, but also see how can we retain the ones that we have here. Engaging with partnerships there would be really great.
00:25:29.514 - 00:26:25.498, Speaker A: I know Maggie's in the room and I know that there are other people in the room that are also leaders with different DNI groups. So hearing their perspectives and engaging in them in a way that's not like how can we just source talent, but also how can we get the knowledge that you have and shared with us, but also how can we fund the mission that you're doing is also extremely important. So I will give you an opportunity to put your money where your mouth is and that is in GetCoins DNI rounds. This is a very easy way for you to fund different groups that are in this DNI space. Within web three, there's two ways you can do it. One is to encourage them to apply to be a grantee in this space and then the other way is to fund them. If you don't realize that a lot of the people who do in this space, especially that are doing de andi work, the money for the work that they do comes out of their own pocketbooks.
00:26:25.498 - 00:27:19.262, Speaker A: And it's like another layer of oppression to tell the group that is being oppressed to fix their own problems with themselves rather than having the people who have the power fund the groups that are oppressed. So if we can start to fund those groups, it's going to be much more impactful in the space and funding in a way that's not conditional. So not in the way that I have $100,000. I want you to go to this school and get all the women that are in that school but saying, hey, what do you need and how can I write the check to best amplify your work? That's the more important thing. You have to believe that the people who are doing the work know the work that they need to do. And the most biggest barrier that they have to that is really just the financial barrier that's been placed usually not on them. If you're asking a group of male VCs and having them wanting to fund women's work and then I have to explain to you why it's important for women to be doing this stuff.
00:27:19.262 - 00:27:45.846, Speaker A: Then you're like, I don't get it. It's probably not me explaining it to you. You might just not get it from your perspective. So it's much more important to say, hey, what can I do to invest in you all to do the work and then appreciate it. Other things you need to do. If you're in a place where you can hire a de I team or role do that. You probably need it now and don't really even know it, but have a champion team.
00:27:45.846 - 00:28:36.040, Speaker A: Have a person dealing with it right now, with as much money that we're floating around doing swag and everything else, you could probably fund one person on your team to actually take this on and empower them to make the changes that they need to make. Okay, so I will give you an opportunity. These are the ones that I know that you can actually fund with, but I also know it is not an inclusive list. So if you know one that I should know, you can do one of two things. You can tweet at me and say, hey Gloria, you should know this group and then I will continue to build up the list. Another thing is when we start to break out into teams, I would love a team that would just take on the challenge of saying, hey, let's create a doc that has as many of these DNI in web three lists that we can, and then we'll just share the doc after the session. And that will be one of the takeaways from the session too.
00:28:36.040 - 00:29:13.090, Speaker A: So yeah, whatever ones that you know, please feel free to amplify them. You can amplify themselves and you can do it that way too. The s in Arrows and Heroes is for shout out. It's for support. The other way that you can shout out and actually kind of transition this whole power dynamic is also to amplify someone who is not like you, who does your work, doing the work that use you. Because a lot of times the people who are in the Oppressed group, their work does not go noticed. So whatever you can do to amplify the work of the Oppressed group is absolutely amazing too.
00:29:13.090 - 00:29:48.638, Speaker A: So if there are like, people who are, let's say, working in layer ones hold on, wait. People who work? Yeah, let's just say layer ones. And there are like great women in layer ones that we should be following that have actual technical skills or that people should know about. Let's just create a list of the 50 women working on layer ones that you should know about. There's no reason we can't get all their Twitter names and send that out by the end of the conference today. Too there's women doing work that should be amplified, but their voices aren't heard or they're drowned out because they're not in the. Powered group.
00:29:48.638 - 00:30:10.934, Speaker A: So that's one of the other teams, if you want to work on that in the second when I let you break up, we can do that, too. All right. So usually I say do the work. Do the work is the most important thing in this time. Do the work for these oppressed groups and not expect the oppressed groups to do the work for you. And so during the remaining time that we have in this workshop, I'm going to give you the opportunity to do the work. The do the work is going to come in multiple different ways.
00:30:10.934 - 00:30:49.620, Speaker A: If you want to do the work solo, you can take the privilege test. The privilege test is a buzfeed test on privilege. It kind of is great to see where you have privilege, the different types of privileges, things of that nature. Then there's the Harvard implicit bias test. You can do that work as well. Then the other thing that you can do is to double check your code of conduct at your work and see if there's actual procedures that are in place in order to move forward. You can look at your diverse roles and mods and see if there is diversity in your mods, in your stewards, in your board, and recommend someone.
00:30:49.620 - 00:31:53.058, Speaker A: The other way you can do is donate to a grant round. We talked about Twitter amplification, but the biggest thing that I would ask today, like, if I could have us work on anything, is there has been an issue for a group that's been oppressed feeling very unsafe here at DevCon. And I would really like a group of us to think of a way that we can keep people safe here for the remaining of the two days and what that would look like. So if you want to try to think out ways that we can keep people safe for the remaining of the time at DevCon, while we're here, there will be a group that will go ahead and brainstorm that. I don't mind if it's like hacker style or unconference style, where we either have to get a list or have a board or have some type of way to report when people feel unsafe and have an actual follow through, but if that's something you want to tackle, we can tackle that. So other than that, too, if you all think of anything else that you want to tackle, that's fine. Unconference style means that there's whiteboards and there's pens and there's postit notes.
00:31:53.058 - 00:32:13.534, Speaker A: And if you want to create a list of the 50 black people in Web three that you should follow, you can do that. If you want to do any type of things. If you have an idea, I'm more than happy to hand over the mic. You can pitch your idea, and people can start working together on that. Colton? Yeah. You want to go ahead and stand up and pitch it?
00:32:13.572 - 00:32:40.730, Speaker C: Yeah. So in my web two background. There were definitely a lot of conversations we had like this, but a lot of the most of the guys around me were purely allergic to many of the raises. And it's been really fun to sort of rediscover this lens, mostly through you, Gloria, but I'm still wondering how to approach this type of conversation with all the people who decided not to be here.
00:32:46.780 - 00:32:59.310, Speaker A: All right, let's move yourself to a table, and then people can come to you. Anybody else want to pitch an idea of DNI thing that they want to work on here? Yeah.
00:33:00.500 - 00:33:07.170, Speaker C: In dao Constitutions or Covenants, there is often a code of conduct. We could explore that.
00:33:11.940 - 00:33:40.916, Speaker A: Okay. Codes and conducts and procedures in Dows. You want to take that table right there? All right. Anyone else have an idea they want to explore? Because I'll throw some out. All right, let's say if you want to take the privilege test, I'm going to put it back in the back corner right there. I'll tell you how to get onto that site. If you want to explore safety at Defcon, I'm going to keep lowie here, and you can hang out with loey.
00:33:40.916 - 00:34:04.064, Speaker A: I trust you to explore that. That would be good. If you would like to make a list or Twitter list of people we should follow of different types of DNI background. Let's try do you mind being Latin? M in the back? All right, let's see. Can we get a black at one that will give us a black at list? Cash, you want to take that one? All right, cool. Cash. We'll keep that there.
00:34:04.064 - 00:34:34.070, Speaker A: Women. Do you want to do a women list? Maggie, can I keep you in charge of the women to follow list? Awesome. Neurodivergent or LGBT? Do we want any of those lists? It anybody want to do an organizational list? Okay, organizational list. Awesome. Okay, cool. I will let you all spread to wherever you want to spread. I'll give you this moment, and then we'll get started on any of the lists that you want to go on.
