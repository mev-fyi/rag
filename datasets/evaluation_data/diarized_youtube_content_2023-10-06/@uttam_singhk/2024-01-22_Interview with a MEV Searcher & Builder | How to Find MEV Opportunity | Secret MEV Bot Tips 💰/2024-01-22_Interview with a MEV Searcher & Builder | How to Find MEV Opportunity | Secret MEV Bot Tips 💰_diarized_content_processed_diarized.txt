00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.160, Speaker A: Gm Gm everyone. I'm Uttam and I'm here with zero expenses who has been really active in this MeV space. So thanks a lot, Zero X Princes, for joining this and helping us to understand more about MeV. And in this crash course, your session would be really helpful. So welcome and go ahead and maybe introduce yourself and share your journey how you got into this Mev and crypto space.
00:00:24.610 - 00:01:45.710, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Thanks for inviting me to this podcast and your session. So we were actually MeV searching. Since 2020, our team is doing arbitrage on Ethereum, and we have started along before PBS came out and flashbots became popular. And actually the flashbots are introduced all the PBs and the MeV term in particular. And back then, everything was called just arbitrage, and we were just running boats without knowing it would be called meV. Since flashbots have started, I think all of the operations got drastically less complex and risky, because before you had to send your transactions, right to the mempool or transaction pool as you wish, if your transaction didn't land, you would actually see it reverting and you would be paying for its fees.
00:01:45.710 - 00:03:18.710, Speaker B: And because of the high competition in this space, because there were a lot at stars, liquidation bots, then arbitrage bots, and also sandwich bots, there was a huge competition in the space, and a lot of back then, you would see like half of the block, up to half of a block of just bots reverting their transactions, especially at the top of the block. And so that's why Flashbus came out and said, look, we are wasting like half of the block space for just reverse transactions, and we are making it very hard for just normal people to transact in Ethereum. We would not like to eliminate all this competition and just make, it's impossible to do arbitrage, liquidations, et cetera. But let's make it a separate environment. And they started, it wasn't PBS at first, so it was back in the proof of work era. But since PBS, it became really popular and commoditized, so it became widely accepted as a norm in the searcher space. Before the ipbs.
00:03:18.710 - 00:04:36.290, Speaker B: I think there would still be a lot of searchers and bots sending their transactions to the mempool, especially long tail ones. But I think now, like 99% of all mev related transactions are sent being sent to the flashbots. And it became so popular that this practice of having such environments became widespread to other chains as well. So we can see other, I would not say like flashbots, copycats, but other projects that are trying to make environments for auctions for the block space. And they're like, integrating order flow and the block space from the validative side into the one environment. So there is a polygon fast lane, for example, on polygon, I think. Yeah, you know, that, and that's like a great auction with a very different design than flashbots, and it's actually much more constrained, and it's better, in a sense that it doesn't allow sandwiches to occur.
00:04:36.290 - 00:05:24.818, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's great in this case. So there's also wall chain on many networks, I think, live. It's not really a block space auction, but it's an order flow auction that's also very similar. It just integrates with Dapps right, in their UI, and it connects users directly to searchers. And there's also blocksrout who's operating on BSC. They're building blocks in the same manner as flashbots are doing on fume. And their auction is very similar.
00:05:24.818 - 00:05:39.922, Speaker B: It's, I think, flashbots compatible. Totally. And, yeah, so we see the rise of these kind of environments since flashbots have popularized and got adopted by the industry.
00:05:40.066 - 00:05:52.240, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. Okay, awesome. So can you also just go deep dive into your working day to day? What do you work on? What do you're working on currently? Do you have a team or if you can share that?
00:05:52.850 - 00:06:52.480, Speaker B: Yeah, so we are making arbitrary spots. So we have only one strategy, because there's a huge piece called MeV, and we can separate it for multiple pieces. And the largest piece is stat arbitrage, that connects CFI and Defi. And then there comes sandwiches. That's called hostile MeV, because it actually makes user execution worse, because it sandwiches the user's transaction and affects user's execution price. And then there's backrun arbitrage. So when you are placing a transaction behind the user's rate.
00:06:52.480 - 00:08:07.720, Speaker B: So users trading on some pools, amm pools usually, or it creates some order in the order book and your back. Right, and this order makes, it affects the price in these pools that users is using, but very often other pools remain unaffected. And it basically creates an arbitrage window so you can place your own transaction to balance the price in these pools. And that's not hostile. That's actually very good thing in the space, because it makes price in all dexes the same, basically, and it balances it. So other users that will be trading on these tokens will not have to compare all these prices in all different dexes to see which price is better. They can just come to any decks with liquid pools and just do their trades without worrying about the price.
00:08:07.720 - 00:09:01.238, Speaker B: That was what we're actually doing. The competition for these pieces is very, we, it's very, it pretty much correlates with their market share. So the larger the piece, the more competitive it is. And so the background arbitrage is the second, I think, most competitive piece. Unlike many searcher and searcher teams, we're not doing the so called long sale arbitrage, but we are just focusing on this one particular strategy, which is back running user order flow and doing an arbitrage in the same block.
00:09:01.334 - 00:09:35.134, Speaker A: So, yeah, my second question was actually really about this mvv current landscape. Right. So right now, if anybody who wants, who is now interested in MBB, he's just entered into this space. Right. So what will be a good advice from your side in terms of becoming a searcher? Or maybe they should become a builder or they should become both? Or what will be your advice these days? I've seen specifically searchers focus on particular apps. Like recently there was friend attacks. I've seen the static stats of MeV there.
00:09:35.134 - 00:09:37.320, Speaker A: So what's your advice? Go ahead.
00:09:37.930 - 00:11:01.680, Speaker B: So what I think actually, yeah. And that if you are a solo searcher and you do not have lots of resources to start with and you don't have any capital, you don't have any relevant experience from the past, I think it would be easier to do this long tail arbitrage, focusing on not very competitive chains or not very venue apps. So basically you are betting that these apps will became popular enough so you'll start making a revenue before everyone else. Because large searchers like us, we are focusing on apps that are already popular. And so there's always a room for small searchers to hop on this train before it gets some traction. So as with friend of tech, the first bots appeared, I think even like in the first 20 hours when it came live, because it used very simple APIs. Because I too checked this, I wanted to make simple bot for friend tech.
00:11:01.680 - 00:12:03.086, Speaker B: Yeah, it is very simple APIs. It was very simple to actually create a bot in literally hours. And so users who registered, who made their bots fast, they profited a lot when it became really popular, because friend attacks became, I think, much more popular than everyone have been expecting it to be. Those who hoped early, they've earned pretty much a lot of revenue. And if you're a stole searcher, you should target apps like that. You should target chains like that. It would not be a good volume or it will not be a good revenue.
00:12:03.086 - 00:13:25.994, Speaker B: Unless the app will became popular. But it's a good start, and I think it's the only viable option for someone to get an experience for the actual searching experience, because there's a lot of places where you can make mistakes, and there is a lot of, like, it's very complex, like usually mev, because it requires you to be very knowledgeable in execution clients in how consensus on particular chain works. So, for example, searching on Ethereum and searching on BSC is two very different beasts, because the consensus on BSC is wildly different than the one from Ethereum. Yeah, because if you send transaction on BSC, you would not be included in the days block, but in two blocks after the current block. Previously, you had to predict, and you still have to predict what the next block will be, because you are actually targeted, not this block, but the block after it. That's very complex topic. And there's a lot of other chains.
00:13:25.994 - 00:14:29.170, Speaker B: For example, the avalanche. It actually has a private mempool that actually is not available for normal people funding clients. You have to be the validator to have access to the mempool. Every chain has a lot of nuances, and if you're a searcher, if you're starting as a searcher, I think it's mostly positive thing for you, because it actually gatekeeps other teams, large teams that are already competing on large chains to enter. So they are not entering other chains because of these nuances. And these nuances will also help you to get a hands on experience of participating in this market. I think you should target these long tail opportunities if you're starting.
00:14:29.170 - 00:15:05.230, Speaker B: So that's my general advice. But otherwise, if you want to have sandwiches or arbitrage, that's the most like, because these are the most popular topics. Everyone's talking about sandwiches. Everyone says, look, these bots are making, like, millions in profits. Like, look at the Jarrett from subway, et cetera, et cetera. And everyone wants to be the next jared, right? They do not want to make a ramen profitable bot. Right, to make hundreds of dollars per month.
00:15:05.230 - 00:15:21.940, Speaker B: They want to make millions right away. And that's the common mistake people are making, because these are highly competitive niches, and they are not a great place to start.
00:15:23.510 - 00:15:33.640, Speaker A: I've actually heard somewhere that 50% to 60% of the job is to reduce latency, and the rest is code optimization. Is that true?
00:15:34.730 - 00:16:35.158, Speaker B: It depends on the chain. Again, on binance, smart chain on BSc, for example, where we also operate. So the latency, I think, is one of the greatest things that you're optimizing for. Now it's not that crucial since blocksrout came with their own block auction. But before, when everyone were operating in transaction pool, the latency was very important, and especially because that binance had a lot of pools, they had much more tokens than theirs on Ethereum. So I think now it has literally like millions of pairs deployed. That's a huge number, because on Ethereum, you cannot imagine that much of uniswap pools being deployed.
00:16:35.158 - 00:17:51.330, Speaker B: But on binance smart chain, where all the fees are negligible, you can easily deploy. And so all the shitcoin makers, creators, devs, they are spamming these pairs like crazy. And so there's like, I think maybe tens of thousands of new pools created each day on binance smart chain. And so there's a lot of room for optimization, because you have to make a bot that would actually be able to process all these pairs, because the block is only 3 seconds. On binary smart chain, you have to be able to process hundreds of millions of arbitrage cycles in just a matter of milliseconds to be able to place your own transaction there before everyone else. So that's a huge factor in such chains. But on Ethereum, I think it's not that crucial, especially if you're starting, if you're like middle search, the average searcher.
00:17:51.330 - 00:19:06.060, Speaker B: So the latency is not the first thing you're targeting for. So your first target, if you're starting, is to actually have proof of concept that works, because there's lot of points of failure there, and you can make mistake literally everywhere. So you can make mistakes in the contracts that makes your solution revert. On chain, you can make wrong bundles that would revert, you can make wrong computations, wrong optimizations off chain. I mean, optimizations that are optimizing for parameters that you would pass in the smart contract, such as amount in, if you are doing arbitrage, for example, so amount of tokens you're actually be swapping in this arbitrage cycle. So what you're targeting on a few is to make just the bot that works, and that works in a matter of 12 seconds. That's already hard.
00:19:06.060 - 00:20:52.860, Speaker B: Believe that it's not that easy, because our first bot, I think our first proof of concept that we made, I think it made all its computations, I think way like for way longer time than 30 seconds. So we computed all our address right after two blocks or three blocks already came out, because it's actually, from the mathematical optimization standpoint and point of view, this is a very hard mathematical problem to optimize and so just having a bot that would somehow work, it's already great. Latency, I think, is not really important unless you are working on very latency optimized chain, because I think maybe on chains like Solana it will be like a great deal because it's actually a high performance chain on things like arbitrum, for example, or optimism, where you have to ping. I don't know about optimism, but I remember that on arbitrum you have to ping constantly their sequencer so they will send you the latest state update about the arbitrage state so you can have the latest price on all the pools you're interested in. The latency there was like a huge deal. And because the arbitrage doesn't actually have any blocks, right. They're processing all these transactions first in, first out order.
00:20:53.230 - 00:21:12.660, Speaker A: Actually. That is very interesting. I wanted to get into this l two topic. So what is going to happen in these l two s? Because PBS eventually, like the proposal builder, separation is eventually not going to come on these l two s. Right. So with having a centralized sequencer, I think it's like taking a step back. So what's your views on that?
00:21:13.750 - 00:22:30.970, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very interesting topic. And as he knows, a huge narrative in ethereum space that at some point there will be a shared sequencer. And so many teams, I think maybe not a lot of teams, but the ones that are doing it are very vocal, I guess, and a lot of people are talking about it, is that right now we have centralized sequencer, but we will make a better one. So we're now focused on stuff that just works. But in the near future we'll work on that and we'll make a decentralized sequencer. Of course, I think that centralized sequencer is a step back in terms of actually the crypto values that I have in the industry as the first of all, this is decentralization, actually, and arbitram makes it all. Not arbitram, but most of l two s introduces a lot of compromises that makes these values like nonexistent.
00:22:30.970 - 00:23:26.190, Speaker B: And so they're very centralized. In terms of PBS and all these auctions, I think that we have to come a long way before it gets there. I don't think that PBS, like the flashboards themselves, are very targeted towards launching their systems on l two because it's too far before that point. So we can think about that. And so I think who will first will launch on such like l two s would be order flow auctions, for example. I already mentioned the wall chain, they are integrating right into the D apps. And so they are basically chain agnostic.
00:23:26.190 - 00:24:22.378, Speaker B: And their system does not really depend on the settlement layer and on the execution layer. And so because they are integrating their system into the app, then user sends their intent to swap a transaction. They're connecting user to the searcher, and then searcher sends some kind of quote of how much mev rebate they will give to the user back for their trade. So basically there are searchers who are bidding for user trades. And then when user actually makes a transaction, it goes to the searcher first, then the searcher executes its arbitrage. It goes to the searching in an unsigned way. So the searcher actually doesn't have a raw transaction.
00:24:22.378 - 00:24:56.970, Speaker B: So we can't execute it for the user. The user will have to execute the transaction himself. Researcher makes his own solution. It sends it to the wall chain auction and the wall chain shoot. This is the best solution among all the searchers who bid on this user trade and then they send the solution back to the user and it's the user who sends the full transaction on chain. So it includes call data. The wall chain dives to the user.
00:24:56.970 - 00:25:48.490, Speaker B: This kind of auction, as I said, it's chain agnostic. I think they're already launched in arbitrum, they launched on binance smart chain, and I think they're live on like seven chains already or something. And so they're looking for DFS to integrate with because that's the hardest part. So you have to onboard actual Dapp developers so they can integrate the wallchain's SDK into their UI. And that would be very hard to integrate with the giants like uniswap. Right. Because Uniswap positions itself as very neutral enter.
00:25:48.490 - 00:26:18.820, Speaker B: And so they're trying to make all their systems in house without involving everyone from the site. So it would be very hard for these order flow auctions to integrate with the DD apps. But technically I think that's the only possible way to be live on ltus. So there's no other way such, any kind of auctions would be able to go live on these.
00:26:19.770 - 00:26:52.270, Speaker A: Okay, got it. Okay. Yeah. So now my next question would be around enshrined PBS. So currently, how is your relationship? How is one's relationship is like searcher and builder relationship right now? So searchers creates his bundle, does he broadcast his bundles to all the block builders? How is that relationship? And then also right now, I have heard that in the mev boost, with mev boost, there is problem with centralized relayers. Right. So how is that going to change with enshrined PBS?
00:26:53.350 - 00:27:29.934, Speaker B: So I think that there is a huge room for improvement in the PBS design. And I think that flashboards, they are doing a great job there currently. How does it work? So the searcher create their bundles. They are choosing builders to send it to. So they are not mandated to send their bundles to all builders that they can choose, they can pick because being a builder is permissionless right now. Right. And.
00:27:29.934 - 00:28:10.618, Speaker B: And being a relay is permissionless too. So you can be an actor in all of these stages of pipeline. What that means is that every builder and every relay have no guarantees that they are actually not acting against searchers or against users. Right. So you can become a builder and for example, as we saw, you can unbundle blocks. Sorry, unbundle the bundles. Yeah.
00:28:10.618 - 00:29:04.810, Speaker B: And that's a huge deal for sandwichers because their main risk is the actual Unbundling because they will else will hold an inventory in a token that's usually a very illiquid token and they would not like to have such kind of exposure. So they would like to have their bundle be an atomic. And so builders does not have any guarantees that they're not acting against searchers. Relays have no guarantees. All of this pipeline is like based on trust, and it's not really provable trust, but the only proof of trust is history. So it's because it's a blockchain. We see who landed, which block.
00:29:04.810 - 00:30:04.186, Speaker B: We see the history, which bundles were being sent to the builder, how builder has acted, what it sends to the relay, et cetera. So most of this data is public. And so if someone is acting against someone else, so we'll see that. And that's the only reason why this pipeline works somehow, because the only thing that makes searchers and builders and relays to be trusted is the history. And then builders would build blocks with bundles that searches have sent them. And then the blocks that they have built, they send it to relays. Relays are choosing the best block possible and send it to validators.
00:30:04.186 - 00:31:15.640, Speaker B: And so I think the huge issue there that is widely discussed is that relays don't actually have a revenue model. So the relays are considered currently as a public good. And so to run a relay, it's very costly operation wise. So it's like hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to just run a relay. And so it's a huge issue because this is the, I think it's maybe the most important actor because it's actually who decides which blocks should be included on chain which blocks it propagates to all the validators, because validators do not decide on anything, they're just receiving blocks. And the validator is one who makes a decision. And so it actually makes a huge.
00:31:15.640 - 00:32:58.230, Speaker B: So it's an issue because there is a possibility that in the future, or there's like technical possibility and theoretical possibility that the relay can be bribed by builders. So this relay could choose the block that's not the best block in terms of revenue to validators, but it can choose the block that's best for revenue of the relay. So builders can include bribe not only to validators, as it currently happens, but they can also include bribe for the relay itself. So it would be actually a very sustainable model for relays, because now relays will be receiving also a part of this distribution of med, because currently they receive nothing, they just exist and they're operating at huge losses. The way that we can front run this issue as Flash Z with the original MEV problem, we can also introduce some kind of reward model to relay as well. So instead of them getting bribes undisclosed in an undisclosed way, that might happen. So it would be very easy to hide, for example.
00:32:58.230 - 00:34:25.598, Speaker B: Right? So the relay might get bribed and it may change addresses, for example, very frequently, and we not see that it's actually getting bribed and it's acting against the whole system. So we can actually make a legit reward model that would require sharing, that would make builders share a part of their revenue with relays as well, in a legit, transparent way. So that's, I think the problem that people are discussing, because that's one of the greatest issues, I think, with the current PBS auction design. Yeah. So there's actually like other direction to think about it because there's not a lot of builders currently, right? So there's like four major builders or something like that, that are building blocks. It actually may happen that having relays is not like, it's not a requirement for this system to be live. Right? So what builders can do is that they can integrate with relays.
00:34:25.598 - 00:34:57.414, Speaker B: So they can run their own relays, for example, like Builder 69 or like Rsync or Beaver build. Like major builders can create their own relays, right. There was a lot of talks that the builders are integrated with searchers. So this is called searcher integrated builder. Right. So there's vertical integration between searchers and builders. But now we can talk about integration between builders and relays.
00:34:57.414 - 00:35:55.834, Speaker B: So builder can integrate the relay until their whole pipeline. And so that would be I think a threat to decentralization. Because currently all the relays that are running are pretty neutral. They are neutral that receive bundles from all builders that exist. But if major builders will run their own relays, because they're already dominating the market, they will reach the same amount or the same number of validators that current neutral relays have. And so they will be just keep dominating. Actual neutral relays will die because they're operating at loss.
00:35:55.834 - 00:36:54.450, Speaker B: But because builders will run their own relays, it will be profitable for them to run these relays. Then validators will not care from who they will receive their blocks from neutral builders from neutral relays like now, or from biased integrated relays, integrated into builders. So they will not care from who they will receive these blocks. Because neutral relays will die. There will be no room for future builders to come, because they will not only have to run their old builder, but they also will have to have a relay that will have to acquire all the validators on Ethereum. And that's like impossible. And we'll be stuck with all these four builders.
00:36:54.450 - 00:38:01.880, Speaker B: That's a huge incentive issue that we have currently. And so currently, for our own goods. It's purely theoretical, but things in MeV landscape moves really fast, I think, especially at the bull market, when the MEV is becoming huge in volume, all these incentives are being accelerated and leveraged. And now it may become from theoretical issue to real issue. No one will be able to stop the builders who are dominating the market currently from integrating it. Because that's a permissionless system. Everyone can do whatever he.
00:38:03.770 - 00:38:13.100, Speaker A: Yeah, that's quite amazing. I've seen a lot of memes on Twitter as well that relayers asking searchers and hey, are you guys getting paid?
00:38:14.750 - 00:38:15.850, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember.
00:38:15.920 - 00:38:44.254, Speaker A: That's really helpful. Okay. Yeah, so I guess that was really insightful, and thanks for that. And also by discussing this, there is a lot of opportunities in the research space as well. As he mentioned that a lot of opportunities are there in this space. So if you are a researcher or someone, go into this space, learn about me. We learn about these relayers.
00:38:44.254 - 00:39:11.920, Speaker A: If you're a researchers, just give your advices how we can improve the space and how you can create decentralization and make sure that decentralization is there. Okay, yeah. Moving on to last question. What are you bullish on in 2024? Especially in terms of MeV sua is coming from flashboards. There was also Eigen layer, Pepsi. Right. So especially in the MeV space, what are you bullish on in 2024?
00:39:12.370 - 00:39:43.080, Speaker B: Yeah. So suaver is a very discussed topic, because everything that slash bots did were quite adopted very warmingly in the space. So everyone not liked what they did. For example, I started my Twitter journey with threads that criticized flashbuds and their auction design because I didn't really like what they have done.
00:39:45.210 - 00:39:47.720, Speaker A: You criticize them and then you join them.
00:39:48.030 - 00:40:36.914, Speaker B: Yeah, but then no one had a choice but to top this system, because they have become favorable by validators. And the validators, they are the ones who are settling all the blocks. And so initially, it was miners. So we searchers are very poor people in terms that no one listens to us. We are not crucial a part of the system, so we are replaceable all the searches. So one searcher goes away, the others will come. And that's why we are bidding like 90% of all our profits.
00:40:36.914 - 00:41:14.098, Speaker B: So we are left with a very little profits because we are at the very start of this supply chain. And so we are not the ones who are making decisions. Right. So the builders will make their decisions, the relays will make their decisions, and then developers, who will make their decisions as well. But searchers, they're not making any decision. So, yeah, everything that flashbots did was quite adopted very well. They're working on suave now.
00:41:14.098 - 00:42:17.842, Speaker B: They're very focused on it. A lot of people are bullish on suave because it, like all the auction between all the chains as they're staking. I don't think that it will be as adopted as the current PBS design, to be honest. So I'm not really, I would not say I'm bullish on suave, to be honest, because current system, the current PBS design, while it's flawed and it's a trusted pipeline, but we can improve that, as I mentioned. And it's an old working system. It's relatively transparent, and it's an easy system because it doesn't have any strong guarantees. It's an easy to implement, and so it's easy to participate in currently.
00:42:17.842 - 00:43:22.826, Speaker B: And so, for example, our team is making builder right now, and we were working on builder since PBS came out. We just didn't have enough order flow, private order flow, to start and be competitive. But it's an easy system. But suave, I think it's a different beast in terms of complexity, and it would be much more complex to actually implement and run, I think, and so much less people would understand all of the nuances of suave. And so the flatbots will dominate the space again, and it would be very hard to actually decentralize not in terms of. In theoretical terms, but it's just only flashbots team who will understand how Soava actually works. And so no one will be able to just easily build for all of this ecosystem.
00:43:22.826 - 00:43:55.538, Speaker B: Because the PBS ecosystem is very diverse. There's a lot of factors on all of these levels. So Ava tries to unionize it and make it all into one integrated system. This will just work for everyone. But, yeah, no one will actually be incentivized to implement it at the first place because they already have. PBS doesn't give any more revenue to validators. It doesn't give any more revenue to builders.
00:43:55.538 - 00:44:42.870, Speaker B: It doesn't give any more revenue to almost everyone. So it makes the same job, but with more guarantees. But I'm not sure that these guarantees are demanded by all people that are actually in the space. So I'm not saying I'm bullish on Suawa. So what I'm bullish on, as I mentioned, is order flow. So the one problem is that the huge part of the supply chain is currently mostly untouched. That's the interaction of users wallets and other order flow originators with searchers and builders.
00:44:42.870 - 00:45:54.362, Speaker B: Because currently, most of the order flow are still coming from public transaction pool. But you know that there's already the most popular order flow auction called mev blocker, right? That takes orders from users, and it actually bypasses all the mempool operations and gives these transactions directly to builders privately. I think that's the last part of the supply chain that's relatively untouched. And the competition will shift from competing among searchers and builders. It will shift to competing for user acquisitions directly. So each party would like to have the exclusive order flow to not compete with others in the public space. So they would like to acquire users directly from dapps, or acquire users from, for instance, telegram bots, trading telegram bots.
00:45:54.362 - 00:46:37.686, Speaker B: And like many, many order flow, there's many order flow originators that would be that. That everyone would like to acquire and get the order flow from them. So that's what I'm bullish in 2024. So I don't think that's, like, a huge topic for newcomers because of that. But in terms of the overall design and overall ecosystem, I think that's an actual end game. And developments of these order flow auctions. That would not be an auctions for the block space, but be the auctions for the actual users.
00:46:37.686 - 00:47:36.926, Speaker B: I think that would be the major topic in the MEV space in 2024. And I think that it would be the single topic that would be actually relevant because the current competition, the only thing that really matters, it's not the latencies, it's not anything else. Because it's an olive explored. Because we usually say about MeV that it's a dark forest. Right? And the flashboards came to give us a latin that would to light this dark forest. But I think actually this dark forest is mostly explored already, like Baya, the top teams especially. And there's almost no alpha left in the space.
00:47:36.926 - 00:47:53.666, Speaker B: And so everyone are trying to shift the competition to unexplored areas. And the single unexplored area is the actual interaction with the user. With the user. So, yeah, that's what I'm most bullish on. 24.
00:47:53.848 - 00:48:14.742, Speaker A: That's actually awesome. Yeah, awesome. Yeah, I guess that was really insightful. Thank you so much for joining. This means a lot. And maybe, hopefully we will have another podcast where you can share more experiences and maybe in 2025 you can come in again, share your. Whether your things you are bullish on was successful or not.
00:48:14.742 - 00:48:24.746, Speaker A: But yeah, thank you so much for joining. And I will drop the link to your Twitter. So if anybody wants to follow, go and just follow him on Twitter.
00:48:24.938 - 00:48:29.850, Speaker B: Yeah, really like the chat. Thanks for inviting me. See ya.
