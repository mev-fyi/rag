00:00:00.250 - 00:00:40.198, Speaker A: Hey everyone, I'm Uttam Singh and in this video of Polygon Defi guide playlist I'm going to show you how you can transfer your token from Binance to Metamask and back from metamask to Binance. So let's get started with our video and if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet, subscribe to the channel and also hit the bell icon. So whenever I upload a new video you will get a notification. So I am on the Binance platform. So if you have an account on Binance, do log in with your email and password. And as usual, the link to the Binance platform is in the description of this video. So if you have an account, click on the login button and if you don't have an account, register now on the Binance platform.
00:00:40.198 - 00:01:43.366, Speaker A: So if you don't have an account, you can click on this register now button and you will be redirected to the sign up web page, right? And it will ask for your country and you need to log in, right? So right now I already have an account on Binance, so I will just quickly log in and then we can start with our video. So I have successfully logged into my binance account and this is how it looks like and I hope so your account also looks similar. Right? So now we have to deposit our token from Binance to metamask. So for that, go to the wallet button that is above, move over through it and you can see a fiat and spot button, right? So click on that fiat and spot. So you will be redirected to a fiat and spot page, right? And here all your tokens that you own are visible. So you can see here are all the tokens that I own and your tokens that you own will be visible on this page, right? So which token you want to transfer as of now? So in this video I'm going to show you the Matic token. But this step is for every token you can use.
00:01:43.366 - 00:02:44.318, Speaker A: This step for transferring Ethereum from Binance to metamask. So in this video, I'm just going to show you the Matic part, right? So here if you own matic, you will see the matic token on your fiat and spot account, right? So if you have matic token, all your matic token will be visible here, that this much amount of matic token is available for you to transfer or this is much amount of matic token you own, right? So on the right hand side on the action tab, you can see all these options. One is buy other is deposit, the other is withdraw and trade, earn and converge, right? So as of now, we need to use the withdraw button. We will be withdrawing token from binance to metamask. That will we will be transferring our token from binance platform to our metamask, right? So this is how after clicking to withdraw, it will look like and as of now, we are going to select the coin as our matic. So I am going to select Matic token. So from here, click on that new address button and then you can write your own address over here.
00:02:44.318 - 00:03:11.654, Speaker A: How you can find your address on metamask. So open your metamask wallet, click on that metamask wallet button and then your metamask wallet will pop up. So from here you can see this is your public address. This is your public address that you need to give it to the people out there for transferring your token. And this address we will be using here as well. So you can see it. So click on that and it will be directly copied to your clip.
00:03:11.654 - 00:03:36.574, Speaker A: And now come back to Binance. And from here, click on that new address button and you can directly submit your address here. Right? And in my case, I have already added a metamask wallet or metamask address through my address book. So this is how it looks like. And now we have to write the withdraw amount. So what is the withdrawal amount that you want to withdraw? Right? And this is 0.2 minimal.
00:03:36.574 - 00:04:12.214, Speaker A: So you have to minimum transfer 0.2 matic from your finance whenever you are withdrawing. Right? So I will just withdraw the minimum token as I am going to show you an example. So I am going to write here 0.2 matic. And also if you want to transfer the maximum amount that you have right now, like all the matic token that you have on the binance, you can click on this max button and all the matic tokens will be there, right? So right now I want to select only 0.2. So I have write the amount two and you have to select between two wallet.
00:04:12.214 - 00:04:41.718, Speaker A: If you want to select from funding, then you can go for funding. If you want to do it from spot and wallet, you can go from smart and wallet, right? So now this is the receive amount. This is what the person will receive. And 0.1 matic token will be deducted as a gas fee, right? So this is clearly mentioned that 0.1 matic will be deducted as a gas fee and 0.1 matic token will be transferred to your metamask account.
00:04:41.718 - 00:05:14.106, Speaker A: Right? So check again your address. So after you click the withdraw button, you will see a risk warning that after you withdraw, your completed full ownership of the assets will belong to the owner of the target address. Please make sure you have entered the correct address. So yeah, please check your address once again because if you have transferred your token and if the address is wrong, that binance can't take it back. And this is what crypto is about. So do read out this risk warnings and if you fully understand it, click on that fully understand and then confirm. After you confirm your button, you will have to again confirm your transaction.
00:05:14.106 - 00:05:41.062, Speaker A: That is, check your label, check your amount, check the address, check the network. That is polygon. In our case, we are transferring Matic token, so the network is polygon. So keep in mind that this transaction cannot be canceled. Right? So now click on that continue button. So after clicking the button, you will see that now your withdrawal request has been submitted and please note that you will receive an email. So you will receive an email from which you have created your binance account.
00:05:41.062 - 00:06:18.034, Speaker A: Once the withdrawal is completed that the receiver will get 0.2 matic and the fee is 0.1 matic and this is how it looks like and this is my address which you will not be able to see and yeah, so click on that complete button and your withdrawal is completed. Now let's check that we have received those token in our metamask wallet, right? So click on that metamask wallet button and then you will see that if you have received your token, you will see it over there. Yes, I have received it. So let me tell you clearly that I was having 0.1 matic token before and I have received the 0.1
00:06:18.034 - 00:06:29.654, Speaker A: matic token now. So total it is 0.2 matic, right? So I haven't received the whole 0.2 matic from 0.2 matic. 0.1 was deducted as a gas fees and 0.1
00:06:29.654 - 00:06:46.442, Speaker A: matic is what I have received. So totally it is 0.2 matic. Also you can click on that three dot and after that you can click on expand view button. And this is how your metamask will expand now. So you don't have to worry about seeing those small, small things. Your metamask.
00:06:46.442 - 00:07:50.818, Speaker A: You can view your metamask as a web page, not just a browser extension, right? So after you click on the expand view, you will see metamask as a web page like this, right? So we have 0.2 matic token now and we have successfully transferred matic token from binance platform to metamask. And now let's learn how you can transfer back from metamask to your Binance account, right? So go on to your metamask wallet, and from there again go to the wallet above, and after that click on that fiat and spot button, and after that you will see again your fiat and spot wallet. So here again you will see all your tokens that you own. So from here, if you want to deposit matic token, go from matic token action. And you can click on deposit. And in case suppose you don't own your Matic token on your Binance account, and if you want to transfer your token, your matic token from metamask to binance, and if you want to do it, you can also do it from the deposit button that is above, right? So you can see the deposit button here.
00:07:50.818 - 00:08:15.142, Speaker A: So click on that deposit button. After you click on that deposit button, you will see something like this. So first of all, you will have to select your coin, right? So in this video I'm going to show you just the matic token. So you can just go over there and you can type matic. So you will see matic polygon. Click on that and you will select your coin. And after that, now select your network.
00:08:15.142 - 00:08:53.266, Speaker A: So which network you are working on? Right, so if you are working on BSC, that is BNB smart chain of binance only, then you have to click over there. And if you are working on Ethereum, if you are using Ethereum network, you have to click on there. In our case, we are using Matic, that is polygon network, right? So click on that, select that polygon network again, and after that you will see an address. So this is your address to which you have to deposit your matic token. You can see that expected arrival, 128 network confirmations. You can also see the expected unlock, that is also 128 network confirmation. So right now the wallet is spot wallet.
00:08:53.266 - 00:09:34.174, Speaker A: If you want to change it, you can click on that change button and you can choose between different wallet and the minimum deposit is 0.1 matic. So this is not now 0.2 matic as we were withdrawing, right? And also ensure that your network is polygon, right? So make sure that you are depositing token to this address from Polygon Network, right? So now click to copy this address. And after that, when you copy it successfully move on to your metamask, right? So here you will see three buttons. One is buy, one is send, and the other is swap, right? So click on that send button. What we here want to do is we want to send our token, that is our matic token from our metamask to binance.
00:09:34.174 - 00:10:11.626, Speaker A: That's why we are using send button, right? So now let's copy and paste our public address that we copied from metamask rights. So directly copy and paste your matic address. So here you will see that you can also select between different tokens. So right now I want to transfer matic, right? So this is how I will select my matic token and now you have to select how much amount you want to transfer, right? So if you want to transfer the whole amount, click on that max button. But here I don't want to transfer all of my account, I want to transfer only 0.1 matic, right? I want to transfer only 0.1 metic from our metamask to wallet.
00:10:11.626 - 00:10:42.682, Speaker A: So I have selected only 0.1 matex. And now if you have now again I will suggest you to verify your address and make sure it is identical as the address given on metamask. Otherwise you will lose your token and metamask and binance. None can do anything in that, right? So if you have checked it out now click on that next button and after that it will ask for your confirmation that we are sending 0.1 matic token to this address. And this is how the estimated gas fees looks like.
00:10:42.682 - 00:11:18.798, Speaker A: And that's why people love to use polygon because the gas fee is very less. You can see it is just only 0.675 matic and if you do this on the ethereum network you will lose a ton of money just as a gas fee, right? So now just click on that confirm button and after you click on that metamask button you have to wait for 15 seconds and you will receive a notification. So if you want to speed up the transaction you can click on that speed up button and then you can give more gas fees. So your transaction is speeded up. But I don't think so. You will need to speed up your transaction.
00:11:18.798 - 00:11:53.646, Speaker A: So let's wait for ten second and I'm pretty sure that your transaction will be done. So I have received a metamask notification here also in the activity section you can see that our transfer is completed. So you can click on that transfer and there you will see that we have sended 0.1 matic token to this address and this address belonged to the binance address that we are transferred. And this address belonged to the binance address that we copied from the binance platform. So this is what the transaction looks like and you can now click on that cut button and you can also see that my token has been deducted. Before it was 0.2
00:11:53.646 - 00:12:18.022, Speaker A: matic and now it is 0.993 matic. Why? Because I have transferred 0.1 matic and the other amount is deducted in the gas fees, right? So now let's head back to the binance and see whether we have received our token or not. So on binance we are on the deposit crypto side. So I will ask you to again refresh it so you can see your deposited your recent deposits. So refresh the page.
00:12:18.022 - 00:13:08.742, Speaker A: So after you have refreshed your page, scroll down to the bottom and there you will see recent deposits. So on the recent deposit section you can see the deposit that we have done that is of 0.1 matic, right? So it is now yet not confirmed yet. Why? Because it is in the confirmation progress. You can also see this confirmation that at 48 by 128, so when it hits 128, your transaction will be completed, right? So it is now confirming that 48 current confirmation. The deposit needs 128 network confirmations. So once your crypto is deposited, you will also receive an email address that your deposit has been successfully similar as you received for the withdrawal, right? So let's wait for some time that is at least one to two minutes or at least ten minutes maximum to maximum ten minutes and your transaction will be done.
00:13:08.742 - 00:13:34.382, Speaker A: So I have received an email and a notification as well that my deposit has been completed. So refresh your page again. So refresh your page again. Then you will see that it will show as completed. So now scroll down at the bottom and see the recent deposits. And there you will see now that this transaction is now completed. This transaction before was confirming, but now it is completed that we have received the 0.1
00:13:34.382 - 00:13:58.866, Speaker A: Matic that we transferred from our metamask wallet. So this was very simple and now you know how you can deposit your token from binance to metamask or back. So this is all for this video. And if you haven't checked out the Polygon defi guide playlist yet, go and check it out. And there are other videos as well. Go and check them out as well.
