00:00:02.880 - 00:00:03.430, Speaker A: You.
00:00:05.480 - 00:00:29.436, Speaker B: Hey everyone, I'm Atham Singh. Welcome back. And this time we have yet another crash course. And this crash course is on stablecoins. So if you are in web three or you are in general in crypto, then stablecoins is a very important topic. And this is more on that technical side of the things, how actually this different types of stable coins work. What are the importance? You can also go through the code as well.
00:00:29.436 - 00:01:15.524, Speaker B: Like there are very less code available on the Internet about the stable coins. But whatever technical side of the things are there on the Internet, I have searched, I have done my research and I have gathered all the information. So you will get a good understanding of all the stable coins after this crash course. And yes, I'm absolutely sure after watching this crash course you will not have to learn or you will not have to do more of your research in stable coins. I guess this crash course will be more than enough for you to have a general understanding of all the stable coins. And if you haven't watched my last crash course, go and watch it. It was on EVM Ethereum virtual machine like core technical working of the things and it got a good response, like 1000 views in a month, which I was not expecting.
00:01:15.524 - 00:01:44.832, Speaker B: My subscribers are low. But yeah, my goal is to create good content if you like it, I'm really grateful you guys liked it and teach people about web three. My goal is I could have charged for this, but I am doing it for free. I just want to teach. So please, I request you to please share this on Twitter and LinkedIn. And also just like, because if you like it, YouTube algorithm takes it to a boom. So yeah, it would be helpful if you can like this video and also comment that you like this crash course.
00:01:44.832 - 00:02:07.656, Speaker B: If you like it, obviously. And then yeah, do tag me on twitter and LinkedIn and let me know. I also have some work for you inside this crash course so it would be a good journey for you. So let's start our crash course on stablecoin. So let's start it. And one more thing before we move ahead. If you are a slow watcher, I don't know if I'm moving fast.
00:02:07.656 - 00:02:28.284, Speaker B: If I'm moving slow, just go to the playback speed on YouTube, just the settings. Do it 1.51.5 x 1.25 x or if I'm going too fast for you, you can slow it down. But yeah, it would be great for you to choose the speed accordingly. I don't know if I'm doing this fast. I thought like last time I was going a little slow, but yeah, if you should choose the playback speed.
00:02:28.284 - 00:03:02.812, Speaker B: So please just choose your playback speed. According to you, whatever suits you. So let's start it. The agenda for crash course on stable coin is first of all, we will go into what are stable coins? Like, just the basic stuff. Like what is stable coins? Actually, if you are absolutely bringing to this space, you don't know about it, then just definition. The types of stable coins. What are different types of stable coins in the market right now? What is the actual importance of it? Like why we are talking about stable coins? What is one of the most important topic in the web, three in the crypto space.
00:03:02.812 - 00:03:28.732, Speaker B: And then we will talk about understanding the mechanics behind stablecoins. So there are lot of terms involved like pegging, characterization, algorithmic stability. We will discuss all of that small, small, just stuff in like few seconds, few minutes, and then we will move on to our main topic. That is types of stable coins. What are different types of stable coins? In the market? There are four types of stable coins. Read it. But there are different types of stable coins.
00:03:28.732 - 00:03:58.316, Speaker B: What are they? And in that stable coins category, like in the types of stable coins, we have different coins as well. So I will choose a single coin, I will choose two coins, which coins are very famous. And we will go through that. We will go through that. Like we have tether, we have USDC coin. So we will understand, we will take it individually, we will go through the code base as well. And then we will discuss all these coins like dai and other tokens, other coins as well.
00:03:58.316 - 00:04:35.016, Speaker B: Then we have risk and challenges. Like what are the risk involved with the stable coins? Like regulatory uncertainty, liquidity. And also there have been a lot of different events which were bad for stable coins. We might discuss few of them. And then we will discuss the future of stable coins, like potential applications. What are the new stable coins on the market? If there is any new type of stable coins or whatever, we will also go through some tweets from few famous persons like Vitalik or whoever person who is good in this space being active on Twitter. If you're not active on Twitter, just go and follow me.
00:04:35.016 - 00:05:10.580, Speaker B: That's links in the description. And also, if you already know the basics, you can skip directly to the types. Or if you want to learn, understand, or if you want to understand this particular coin, like USDC die or whatever coin, I will just put the time over there so you can just choose the particular stable coin and then you can definitely go through that. If that is helpful to you. You can escape this part but, yeah. And if you think if I'm going slow or fast, just change the play with the speed according to you, whatever you feel is good for you.
00:05:10.650 - 00:05:11.604, Speaker A: Okay? Yeah.
00:05:11.642 - 00:05:14.836, Speaker B: So let's move ahead and start our crash course.
00:05:14.938 - 00:05:15.396, Speaker A: Okay.
00:05:15.498 - 00:05:21.044, Speaker B: So first, the caution is, like, why stable coins? Like, why do we actually need the stable coin?
00:05:21.092 - 00:05:21.304, Speaker A: Right?
00:05:21.342 - 00:06:04.544, Speaker B: Why do we actually care about stablecoin? So imagine crypto is too volatile for monetary use for it. You can't use bitcoin for common transaction. You can't use ethereum for common transaction. It doesn't have a stable buying power. For example, if you go to the market, right, tomorrow and you want to buy some oranges or you want to buy some fruits or whatever it is. So if you go to the market today in the same price, whatever the price of bitcoin is, you will be able to maybe buy three apples, right? But what if the next day, you go again to the same market, and he says that now you can buy ten apples in one bitcoin.
00:06:04.592 - 00:06:05.140, Speaker A: Right?
00:06:05.290 - 00:06:28.236, Speaker B: So that will be really bad for you. You will be like, hey, this is my loss. So crypto is not very good for doing no common transaction. It is very volatile. I mean, you can see the chart as well. Bitcoin is really up and down, up and down, whatever the rate is. I don't know what would be the rate in the future.
00:06:28.236 - 00:06:56.672, Speaker B: But, yeah, you can see the chart as well. This is very volatile and not good enough for common transaction. And also, one more, even though people do talk about crypto is the future or bitcoin is the future, bitcoin is going to go to $100,000. Or paraji saying that bitcoin is going to 1 million in 90 days. But people don't put their life saving in crypto. Right. People just only put their investment portfolio.
00:06:56.672 - 00:07:09.464, Speaker B: People don't go all in on crypto, right. Because it's too volatile. They don't put their whole life savings in crypto. There are people who do this. But I will not suggest to put all your life saving in crypto. It's too volatile.
00:07:09.512 - 00:07:09.916, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:10.018 - 00:07:15.704, Speaker B: So crypto can't be used as standard for paying salary or giving a loan.
00:07:15.752 - 00:07:15.964, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:16.002 - 00:07:34.944, Speaker B: So this is also one of the problem. Companies don't use ethereum to give the salaries. Companies mostly use all the stable coins even to give salaries to their employees or giving loans to the people. They don't want to use bitcoin as a loan value, or it's too volatile.
00:07:34.992 - 00:07:35.156, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:35.178 - 00:08:36.896, Speaker B: You understand it, right? And now this is why we need stable coins, because crypto is very volatile, right? And now, what is stable coins? So, stablecoin is a crypto asset that is designed to have a relatively stable coins, as the names even suggest. The primary purpose of stable coin is to maintain a relatively constant value. I mean, obviously it's very hard to get all the time constant value. So relatively constant value and function as a reliable medium of exchange that is not subjected to the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Whatever the price of bitcoin is, $100,000, 30,000, 20,000, whatever the price is, no matter what the stable coins price will remain stable. It will not be affected by the price of any other cryptocurrency. As I said, I gave you the example of Apple as well, right? If you want Apple or oranges, whatever you want, buy a fruit.
00:08:36.896 - 00:09:23.764, Speaker B: You go there. One day you get five apples, the next day you get ten apples. It's like you will be pissed off. It was not good for me that I got five apples yesterday, and now they are giving me ten, right? This is not good, and nobody wants that, right? So that's why you need stable coins actually to grow into this space. Like, if you want crypto to know, stable coins are playing a very important role in the industry, right? So, yeah, again, let's discuss few of the most important topics. Few of the most important importance of stable coins. Like use cases of stable coins, right? There are different use cases for stable coins, but I have just write down three of them, which I feel is the most important.
00:09:23.764 - 00:10:27.624, Speaker B: Stable coins have also become a key building block for all the DeFi protocols. Like many DeFi protocols, on which asset owners can invest their stable coins for set periods of time to earn a certain percentage of yield without risking their investment losing value through market for liquidity, right? This is a very bad thing. So similarly, DeFi lending protocols, several DeFi lending protocols, including multi linear dual platforms like Aave compound, these exist to enable lenders to provide loans to borrowers in the form of stable mean. Imagine if these loans were denominated in a volatile asset such as bitcoin. The lending platforms could not function. Seriously, it could not function. And when the value of bitcoin went up, borrowers collateral would be insufficient to cover the value of the loan, right? I mean, bitcoin fell, borrowers would be left with diminished funds in terms of dollars.
00:10:27.624 - 00:11:02.416, Speaker B: As a result, all these lending protocols would be in a constant state of chaos, like you would even imagine. Like, bitcoin goes, I don't know, maybe 30k on $30,000 in one day and just crashes back 25,000 another day. Right. And this is all these lending platforms. Borrowing platforms could not function, right? I mean, it would be a constant state of jobs. They can only function because borrowers receive their loans in form of stable coins. That actually holds a steady value for the duration of the loan.
00:11:02.448 - 00:11:02.644, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:02.682 - 00:11:48.052, Speaker B: This is like very important. All DeFi protocols are using stable coins to provide all these loans, all that are doing all that stuff, earning yields, et cetera. And yes, it's also act as a reliable medium exchange. As I said, purchase power is relatively stable in the stable coins act as a reliable exchange. People can actually use it for buying stuff and doing daily, daily transaction, day to day transaction. Another thing is that it is very quick and easy way for crypto deals to ensure price stability for their holdings. Like for example, converting cryptocurrency for free FPA currency can take like hours or even days, right.
00:11:48.052 - 00:12:05.704, Speaker B: If you go to finance, I mean, it takes a lot, forever if you have your crypto on ledger or, I don't know, whatever device you are. If you open your ledger, get your debt transferred to exchange, and then on exchange you then have to sell it. I don't know, there are lots of things I don't even like it.
00:12:05.742 - 00:12:05.944, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:05.982 - 00:12:42.676, Speaker B: So if you are a regular trader, it will be very important for you to actually convert it into or just use directly save across. You don't want to get fiat. And it is like a very easy and quick way for crypto traders to ensure price stability even after holdings. Like if a trader, you don't want to put your money in volatile cryptocurrencies, you want it to be safe, right? You can just directly convert it to a stable concept, even keep it digitally, keep it on your ledger, still stable for you.
00:12:42.698 - 00:12:43.076, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:43.178 - 00:13:00.516, Speaker B: There are several use cases like this. I mean, defi industry is like booming and very bullish in stable coins. So yeah, and Defi is definitely the future. I'm very bullish on it. You should also be bullish on. Yeah, that's all about stablecoins importance. There are several use cases.
00:13:00.516 - 00:13:29.504, Speaker B: If you want, you can just google more, find out what are the good use cases. And yeah, post it on Twitter and LinkedIn. And do tag me that you watched this video and you are learning this crash course. So let's move on to our next topic that is understanding the mechanics. So now we know what stable coins are, what's the importance of it, and we have some use cases as well. So now I'll actually understand the mechanics behind the same account. So one thing is pegging.
00:13:29.504 - 00:14:30.036, Speaker B: Okay, so what is pegging refers to? Anchoring the underlying assets value to an external asset. So pegging formally means currency specs, which refers to currency's exchange rate is actually fixed to match another currency or basket of another asset. Essentially, this means that exchange rate between two currencies always, almost all the time, it remains the same. And what does actually pagging means specifically in crypto? Like, in the normal terms, like, pegging is more of like, currency and other stuff, like a normal currency. But in crypto, what does pagging mean? Like in cryptocurrency, pagging actually refers to anchoring the underlying asset value to an external asset, usually in one to one ratio. Usually one to one ratio. It can be in any other ratio, but yeah, it's done so that the packed asset actually mimics the price moments of the other asset or a currency.
00:14:30.036 - 00:15:12.176, Speaker B: So both USDC, like USDC is a very famous USDC and USDT both are one of the famous and most trusted stable coins right now in the market. And so both of them are us. Genre fact that this one unit of this stable coin, like one unit of UGC, one units of UDC, can be exchanged for $1 whenever you are. Like, wherever you are. If you hold a USDC, it can be exchanged for one. USDC can be exchanged for $1, like literally $1. And depending on the type of stable coins, digital currency can be packed using different methods, maintaining reserves.
00:15:12.176 - 00:15:33.804, Speaker B: Like for example, USDC and USDT maintain the reserves for the swimming coins. We'll talk more about this when we talk about USDC and USDT. But yeah, there are different types of other is using algorithm. I mean, Terra was one of the algorithmic stablecoin. We will talk about that. Why I'm laughing. I will also tell you why I'm laughing on that.
00:15:33.804 - 00:16:15.192, Speaker B: But yeah, it was also one of the stable coins that uses algorithm to actually pack the value of the cryptocurrency along with the dollar or whatever you want to bag it with. Okay, so yeah, this is what bagging is. And now we will talk about debagging, right? So we have understand what bagging is. Packing is simply getting a one to one ratio with another currency, like maybe a dollar or anything else. And now what is repacking? Repacking is the opposite of bank. It refers to the phenomena of stablecoin deviating from its indented pack. So repacking refers to actually the phenomena of stablecoin deviating from its intended pack.
00:16:15.192 - 00:17:26.528, Speaker B: Like for example, USDC, if they are packed with $1, it means that their value should always be packed, always be one dollars in terms of if you want to exchange, right? But if that goes down, like if the value is not one dollars, then it is called the deeping event, right? And for instance, if USD packed stable coins drops in value, as I said, under one dollars, then this coin is said to be. And what causes this sudden, recently I'm wearing, creating this crash course, USDC currently, thereby, because there was bank crash, like bank was going down two, three, bank crashed, right? So that's why it got little unstable. The market got unstable. And then the USDC depact, which means the value of USDC got below one dollars. But after a few certain time, it got back to $1. And a lot of people traded this and make a lot of profit. So what can cause this urgent debacking in the stable coins? It depends what type of stablecoin it is.
00:17:26.528 - 00:18:09.560, Speaker B: So mostly like mismatched reserves, I guess. Market, when it outperforms the algorithm, there is more of mismatched in the reserves. And all these crashes and these bangings, people tend to fart a lot and then they got panic and they sell USDC. There are a lot of different events that causes Deepang. If you want, you can go and learn more about the event that recently happened, creating the CMU USDC deep, why it happened and why any Saver clients get deep. So yeah, this is what depagging is. Now, let's move on another topic that is collateralization.
00:18:09.560 - 00:19:07.776, Speaker B: So what is collateralization? Simply in collateralization, just a simple word that it's the process of using one asset as a choice for securing a loan in a different asset. So in simple terms, like if you want to get a loan for your education, or whatever it is, you just have to call that, you have just provide something as a collateralization, right? In terms of simple terms, the collateralization is a process of offering what type of asset, especially in crypto, like any asset, any commodity, or any cryptocurrency, anything that holds a value in order to receive a loan in our different assets. Talking about makerdao, so maker now stable coin, like maker, Shao Shiva coins die, right? Dai is one of the shaver coin that is actually backed to us dollar, but it is backed by the. Talk more about it. You can see in the diagram as well. It is backed by ether. In terms of whatever the value of ether is.
00:19:07.776 - 00:19:44.616, Speaker B: We will talk more about it when we talk about die token, which is a very interesting token, and one of my most lovable token. Now, let's talk about our next topic. What are the different types of stable coins that are present in the market? So we have not stand, what are stable coins? Why it is important. Let's talk about types of stable coins. What are the stable coins that are present in the market? So whenever you go search, you will find these four types of stable coins that are usually talked about. There can be different. Maybe in future there is a new type of stable coins.
00:19:44.616 - 00:20:08.870, Speaker B: But right now there are four of them. Ones. The first one is fear collateralized. The second one is commodity collateralized. The third one is crypto collateralized, and fourth one is non collateralized. That's why I discuss those important topics like words like collateralization, different other words. So if you are very new to this space, you must have known any of these terms.
00:20:08.870 - 00:20:24.916, Speaker B: The first one is the fiat characterized. Let's just go through all these stable coins one by one. We will go through all this. But yeah, let's just take an overview. So fear crash lies. So in the field crash line. The value of stable coins is stable.
00:20:24.916 - 00:20:50.560, Speaker B: So the value of stable coin is stable. As far as now, what we have understood, it is divided. It's called stable coin because the value of the coin is stable and not volatile. And because it is backed. The two are reserved asset and in simple words, are reserved asset backed it. Like for example, our currency used to be backed by gold back then, but now it is not backed by anything. But our usual currency was backed by gold back then.
00:20:50.560 - 00:21:08.128, Speaker B: So, depending on what kind of reserve asset is backing the value of stable coins, there are different types of stable coins that are there in the markets. First one is fiat characterized. It is fiat backed stablecoin. Stable coins that are actually backed by real world currencies in one to one ratio.
00:21:08.224 - 00:21:08.688, Speaker A: Right?
00:21:08.794 - 00:21:39.744, Speaker B: Then we have commodity characterized. It is more like stablecoin that uses commodities like gold, silver, real estate, or ed matters to provide the stability. Then we have cryptocurrenized. It means that it is your cryptocurrency is actually backed by crypto or any other crypto. And the other one is non credit rise, which means also known as algorithmic stable coins. I don't know. There is a little difference between algorithm mixed table coins and non correct.
00:21:39.744 - 00:22:03.924, Speaker B: But most of the algorithm stable coins are non correct. Maybe, I don't know, maybe there will be a new coin or it is there already, like any algorithm that is actually characterized. But silver coins usually reduce algorithmics to control the supply and achieve stability in the marketplace are mostly known as non collateralized or algorithmic stable coins.
00:22:03.972 - 00:22:04.424, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:04.542 - 00:22:39.568, Speaker B: Now, let's deep dive into all these types and discuss more cryptocurrencies. Different stable coins, whatever. Different stable coins are there in this type, right? So let's move on. And first, let's discuss fiat collateralized type. Okay, so fiat collateralized. These days, they have backing of fiat currencies such as euro or the US dollar. These stable coins associated with any value of a specific fiat currency.
00:22:39.568 - 00:23:05.500, Speaker B: You can choose euro, you can choose us dollar or whatever it is. And field characterized stable coins are like the simplest stable coins. It is not very complex. It's very simple. Stable coins with one to one ratio backing. The one to one ratio implies that actually implies that one stable coins would be equal to one unit of currency, such as €1 or €1, whatever that is. Back to.
00:23:05.500 - 00:23:47.800, Speaker B: Okay, so for example, if an issuer has 10 million of fiat currency, it can only distribute 10 million stable coins, each worth one dollars. So if you, for example, you have 10 million of your currency, 10 million of us dollar, then you can only distribute, not you. Although obviously, the issuer of the stable coin will only distribute 10 billion stablecoin each worth one dollars. Our fiat money, as I said, was once backed by gold. And that's a good example of how to understand fiat collateralized. But now, our currency is not backed by gold, it is not backed by anything. That's a trouble.
00:23:47.800 - 00:24:27.972, Speaker B: Now, let's go deeper into USD free and USDC. As I said, USDC and USDT is one of the most famous stable coins in the market, even in terms of market capitalization as well, and very well known stable coins. Anyway, some of the biggest stable coins in this category by market value, are USDC and USDT. And the other ones are Germany dollar. And then we have true USD. This is also one of the famous stable coins. But yeah, one thing to realize is that this type of stable coins are centralized.
00:24:28.036 - 00:24:28.264, Speaker A: Like.
00:24:28.302 - 00:25:00.284, Speaker B: This is one of the problem with this type of fear collectorized. We will talk more about the working of this space, like working of this field characterized. And you will actually understand yourself why this is centralized, right? We will actually go through the code of the USDC and USDC. And there are several features as well that are present in USDT and USDC, which makes it a little decentralized. We will go through the smart contract. You will even understand, you will understand all the functions that are present in the smart contract of USDC and USDT.
00:25:00.332 - 00:25:00.544, Speaker A: Right?
00:25:00.582 - 00:25:09.344, Speaker B: So let's move on and talk about USDT first. What is USDC? So originally, it was named as real Coin.
00:25:09.392 - 00:25:09.892, Speaker A: Yes.
00:25:10.026 - 00:25:48.050, Speaker B: Most of the people don't know it, but yeah, originally it was named as real coin. The token could not compete with popular altcoins. However, after a series of update, it changed its name to tether or USDT and altered its humans technology, whatever, like real coin to USDT. So USDT divided in around 2014, and right now the market cap is 79.7 billion. Like whenever I'm making this video, market cap is $79.7 billion.
00:25:48.050 - 00:25:57.744, Speaker B: So what does this means? Which means that there is some place where this amount of USD is reserved.
00:25:57.872 - 00:25:58.308, Speaker A: Right?
00:25:58.394 - 00:26:19.704, Speaker B: So there might be a place, I don't know, wherever this is. Like USDC or tether issuer have this much amount of $79.7 billion stored somewhere in form of USD. Okay, and this is the third largest market cap coin after bitcoin and ethereum.
00:26:19.752 - 00:26:20.012, Speaker A: Yes.
00:26:20.066 - 00:26:58.384, Speaker B: And overall, all the cryptocurrencies out there, this is the third largest market cap coin after bitcoin and ethereum. So technically, the working of USDC. USDT is very simple. So if you are someone who wants USDT, right, and you have dollar, so they submit $1 to the reserve and the authority is 10th element. Mints the same amount of USDT to the address provided. Keep in mind, they are not mined, they are just issued, right? If we compare it to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bitcoin is mined, but USDT is not mined. They are just issued.
00:26:58.432 - 00:26:59.030, Speaker A: Okay.
00:27:00.220 - 00:27:29.712, Speaker B: Very important thing to remember. Okay, now I guess this is all about USDT stablecoin. Now, there is one problem. There is a problem with these type of stable coins. Now, we actually don't know how much reserve is actually present in the bank, right? It's not like crypto is transparent. Crypto is very transparent. I can actually see, you can see all the transaction, crypto and bitcoin and ethereum, whatever transaction are going on.
00:27:29.712 - 00:27:46.756, Speaker B: But this is not transparent, right? So what if one day you go or everyone goes to the bank like, hey, we want all the silver coins. Like we have this USDT, I want my us dollar back. So will they be able to do it?
00:27:46.778 - 00:27:47.120, Speaker A: Right?
00:27:47.210 - 00:27:56.090, Speaker B: If one day everyone wants dollar in terms of their USDT, right, will they be able to do it? I don't know. Maybe yes and maybe no.
00:27:56.620 - 00:27:57.080, Speaker A: Right?
00:27:57.150 - 00:28:34.372, Speaker B: So this can create chaos. And there is no full transparency of your tether. The tether obviously releases some threats, but they are not frequent enough. We'll be very honest. They release some kind of stress, I don't know, every month, every quarter or whatever, whenever they want to, they release some kind of stress every month or every quarter, but they are not as much as frequent. Like you can't question them obviously. And there is no full transparency regarding this.
00:28:34.372 - 00:29:13.964, Speaker B: Right, so this is like one of the problem with USDT saver coin that is actually present in a market. You can actually read about the blocks and stuff that are actually present, that talks about what is the problem with the USDT coin. And now let's jump on actually to the code of USDT smart contract. Okay, so yeah, let's move on to that. Okay, so now let's move on to the code walkthrough of tether smart contract. So yeah, let's move on actually to ether scan and see the tether smart contract. Okay, so here I am on ether scan.
00:29:13.964 - 00:29:30.900, Speaker B: Like this is the actual contract of USDT that is deployed on Ethereum network. I could have also gone to any other network but yeah, let's do it on Ethereum one. So this is info, I guess this is the right address to overtracker USDT.
00:29:31.340 - 00:29:31.800, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:31.870 - 00:29:54.432, Speaker B: And now let's move on to the code. Like what is the code for USD? And this says you can also find the audit report as well. If you like, you can read it. Yeah, let's move on to a smart contract. Smart contract and what are the function that are involved? Let me actually zoom in a little bit. I don't know if I can do it. That's good enough for you guys.
00:29:54.432 - 00:30:46.960, Speaker B: I hope you are able to see it. You can even just go and search the code on the Google, you will find it. Okay, so this is like the simple smart contract. It is very simple smart contract, not a very complex one. Okay, so this is like the library that has been used. Our highest token contract is window which shows all the libraries that have been used in the smart contract. Okay, so I guess we are here, you can check out that there are save functions like transfer from transfer function or approve function and all the kind of functions that are present in a syllable, erc 20 token.
00:30:46.960 - 00:31:27.208, Speaker B: And yeah, there is one more things that are presented. Like there is a unique feature in Ust that is blacklist function, right? So whenever they want, these guys, like the issuer, the owner can actually blacklist any of the address that supports that it has ustt. So this function can be called, there is a function called add blacklist present here. And that is there. What you will pass is you will pass the address of the user, whichever you want to blacklist.
00:31:27.304 - 00:31:27.708, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:27.794 - 00:32:04.440, Speaker B: And once this user is blacklisted, they will not be able to call the transfer function and transfer their USDT from one address to another. We'll look into it like there may be no modifier or whatever. So that the user who is in the list of ad backlisted, right. The area of adbaglisted, they will not be able to call the transfer of function, right? And there is obviously only owner. There is maybe a modifier that says that only the owner of the function, owner of the contract can call it. So just blacklisted. There is an array of it.
00:32:04.440 - 00:33:06.350, Speaker B: So user is, I guess, mapping of it. And you can add this address to this array of this evil user, which is like blackisted people array, black history people addresses, information and yeah, then there is event that is emitted once the address, once the function is called, this must be an event. Yeah, I guess must be somewhere. It is the event that is being emitted whenever the continent or any other. This is the event that is limited whenever you add another blacklisted address or when you call the blacklist function, right. Then we have remove blacklist. The owner can use it to again remove any address from the blacklist mapping or blacklist array, whatever you want to call.
00:33:06.350 - 00:33:57.212, Speaker B: Okay. Then again, there will be an event that will be limited. You can see it and locks. And there is also going to a function of destroy blackmail. So whatever assets are in those blacklisted smart contract, blacklisted address, this function can actually destroy all the funds that are presented in those address. And then it will again remove the funds from the total supply as well. So that's what you see here is the centralization part of this stable coin, right? This is one of the most, I guess it's useful, obviously, because in some cases there might be some terrorists doing some stuff, and the US government, any government goes to these guys.
00:33:57.212 - 00:35:01.916, Speaker B: It is helpful to do this, but it is not more of like at least centralized code, not like web three dedicated stuff, not dedicated to web three values, right. So this is a little bit problem, but yeah, so this is again our contract, the simple name. Then whenever this function will be called, like I guess this is the constructor, so the total supply, supply, the name, symbol, uSDT, all that stuff. And then we have the transfer function, right? So this transfer function is like, it always checks if it is blacklisted, the address which is calling this transfer function message sender. If this is blacklisted, then he or she, the address will not be able to call the transfer function, right? And there is one more modifier which is, when not paused, it also checked if the transfer function or if actually the USDT contract is not paused.
00:35:01.948 - 00:35:02.096, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:02.118 - 00:35:30.552, Speaker B: So there will be, I don't know, maybe a modifier which says that USDT, if it is paused, then it will not be able to call anybody will not be able to call the transfer function. Right. Not centralized. Then there is another function transfer from. This simply takes another address input. Like not just directly do it from message sender. Again, it's check if it is blacklisted.
00:35:30.552 - 00:35:58.852, Speaker B: And then this has the balance of. To find out the balance of the particular address. And then we have different functions like approve alliances. All the functions that are presented in any ERC 20 token total supply. Yeah, these are, I guess, all the functions that are present in ERC 20 token. If you don't know about ERC 20 token, just go and read about ERC 20 token. What is that? It'll be good for you.
00:35:58.852 - 00:36:42.384, Speaker B: Yeah, this is like a very simple smart contract. I just wanted to go through these functions like regulation functions and all these modifiers that represent the smart contract that actually matters and what makes it unique and different and not decentralized. Not decentralized, but up to you if you want to call it good. There is definitely good things that you can do with the things. Okay, so let's move on to our next stable coin that is USDC. So USDC is almost same as USDT. Almost a smart contract is same.
00:36:42.384 - 00:37:15.224, Speaker B: There is some extra functionality. And recently USDC issuer like Circle, called Circle, we'll talk about it. They recently launched one good new feature that is CCTP cross chain transfer protocol. We will actually learn about it. So let's move on to our next stable coin that is USDC. Okay, so let's talk about USDC. So USDC stable coin is also a digital currency that is fully backed by your store asset.
00:37:15.224 - 00:37:46.312, Speaker B: Like again, one to one ratio. Right now when I click this picture, it is not one dollars when I created this video. So yeah, usually it is back to one to one with us dollar. Well, in this case, well, in this case, USDCK, there is an organization called Circle which uses the bitcoin. Like in USDT, it was tether limited one. In here it is a circle one.
00:37:46.446 - 00:37:46.840, Speaker A: Right?
00:37:46.910 - 00:38:57.416, Speaker B: And I don't know if they actually have a dow or not. So Melj claim to be more transparent. So we have circle claims to be USDCP to be more transparent than USDT. It's usually the same as USDT, but what they do is they have more transparency than USDT and they're showcasing reserves and are more in sharing those stuff as compared to USDT. And what market has seen as of now? And yeah, I mean this is all about USDT, same as USDT. And the market cap, you can see right now the market cap is the same again, that this coins, like this much amount of dollars are actually, as they say, they have this amount of us based currency in their banks. Or they have, the circle actually says like wherever they are, they have this amount of stable coins.
00:38:57.448 - 00:38:58.030, Speaker A: Okay.
00:38:58.480 - 00:39:36.760, Speaker B: And also, one more thing. All these issuers, all these organizations, they don't keep it as it is. I mean, they have the right to actually invest the USD, the dollar to anywhere else. Like for example, for example, you want in the future, you want a USDC. So what the process will be, you go to circle, you submit your reserve, you have $10,000. You submitted us USDC, you can definitely get it from any other exchanges. But if you want to directly issue USDC, you can just submit your reserve and you can issue USDC.
00:39:36.760 - 00:40:10.036, Speaker B: But these circle, this organization have this right to. And they also do, they take some part of your money and they invest in separate things like government bonds or whatever stuff. Just like traditional banks. Traditional banks also does the same thing. They take your money, they keep some longer money in the bank and they invest some amount of money. All right, so again, the curl USDC is fifth largest in terms of market client trade, bitcoin, USDT. There is one more, I don't know that is.
00:40:10.036 - 00:40:39.470, Speaker B: And then we have USDC. Okay, so now let's again walk through the code of USDC. And we will also discuss one important feature they just recently launched, like crosschain transfer protocol. We will talk about that. And also they have integrated it with vamo. If you don't know, it is a crossing bridge, my son. So we will talk about that.
00:40:39.470 - 00:41:11.560, Speaker B: So let's go through the code base of USDC. So let me again move to etherescan and let's check out. Okay, so I found out this USDC contract on Etherescan. Again, same to same as USDT. You can find all this stuff, all the details over there. You can find the contract. This is the contract that is for USDC.
00:41:11.560 - 00:41:57.988, Speaker B: I actually went to their GitHub and find out they have all the things explained on their GitHub. So rather than actually seeing this, let's move on to their GitHub, which actually experiences very better. And it will be good for you to understand things as well. So this is like the center like circle. They have this GitHub repository. I will provide a link in the description which you can visit, right? So they have all this stuff present over there. And when we say the contract one, okay, so they have all this main function they have already possible, which you can pause stuff, right? The entire contract can be frozen in case of serious bug is found, same to same as USDT.
00:41:57.988 - 00:42:39.252, Speaker B: This contract can be frozen again. Then it is upgradable, which is a proxy contract is used recently? Not recently, but yeah, circle issued a v two USDC, which has some extra functionalities and how they were able to do it because their contract is upgradable. That is, they are using proxy contract, which is one of the important things in solidity. If you are solidity developer, I don't know if you are not, but I'm planning to create one video on proxy contract as it is very important. It is also very dangerous as well. Why it is dangerous? We will talk about it. So yeah, this upgradable, they have their v two function.
00:42:39.252 - 00:42:59.144, Speaker B: We will talk about that as well. V two contract. Okay, then again the blacklist one that was again same as USDP. And then we have minting and burning how minting and burning function and ownable function. So let's move on to another code that I found in their repository.
00:42:59.272 - 00:42:59.612, Speaker A: Right?
00:42:59.666 - 00:43:35.132, Speaker B: So this is more like explaining the design of the token. Okay, so they have few tokens, they have roles, different kind of roles. One is masterminder, which adds and removes minters and grease their minting allowances. So there are several minters present, which whoever could issue USDC, they are called minter. So they are minters. They actually remove minters, right? And they are minters, right. These minters can destroy and create token.
00:43:35.132 - 00:44:36.570, Speaker B: Okay, so again, these stable coins is not web three variable, like not decentralized. I would say that the poster one rule which can pass the contract and the blacklister one, the one who can blacklist all the addresses so that all the minting and the transfer function or minting and burning functions cannot be called. Then we have owner function, which can be reassigned any of the rows except for admin. And then admin is the curator contract and reassign itself, which should be able to do the proxy stuff. Then we have again, this is ERc 20 token. So transfer, transfer from all these functions that are present and then simple ERc 20 token. And then I guess there are nothing as such as important like they have just discussed the functions, like minting function, how it works, and burning function, how that works.
00:44:36.570 - 00:45:13.216, Speaker B: Then again, the blacklisting function, adding a blacklisting address, how you can do that, there will be a function that you will have to call pass onto the address and only I guess the owner would be able to do that. Remove from blacklisted address passing and again reassigning rules how these things work. If you are really interested in the token design, you can go through that and it will be helpful for you to understand if you want to do that. Okay, so this is actually a smart contract of USDC. This is version one. Like pa token v one. There is also v two we will discuss here in this blog.
00:45:13.216 - 00:45:53.888, Speaker B: This was one of the interesting blog that I found out. So this is a smart contract that imports these different libraries with different functions. Then yeah, it's ERC 20 token. As we discussed already, there are different events that in future you can check all these stuff and I guess we will just go through the important stuff. In the smart contract, there is a modifier, the only minter which will be checked while calling a function. Okay, so again, this is like a mint function person in the actual function to mint USDC. Again, it is minted.
00:45:53.888 - 00:45:59.136, Speaker B: It is not as mined as bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.
00:45:59.248 - 00:45:59.910, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:02.360 - 00:46:05.620, Speaker B: It's not decentralized, it is centralized, I guess.
00:46:05.690 - 00:46:06.356, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:06.538 - 00:46:37.484, Speaker B: And yeah, this is like simple functions that you can check out. I don't know if you know certainty or not, but yeah, this is very simple functions that you can check out. Balance of approved function. All this ERc 20 functions that are present. Let me see if there is anything important to actually discuss. And this is like the burn function which you can use to burn the smart contract. And there is like all this minter stuff that was new in there as compared to USD.
00:46:37.484 - 00:46:52.100, Speaker B: But yeah, this is same as USDT. Okay, so now let's move on to USDC V two. So there is a function there, it might present in there. Yeah, this is the one. V two is there? Yes, it is there.
00:46:52.170 - 00:46:53.092, Speaker C: Function V two.
00:46:53.146 - 00:47:25.312, Speaker B: V two. So this is a smart contract that is present. So you can actually check that out. But yeah, I guess this blog on Coinbase, this was actually something that I found interesting and useful. So let's check out this blog and understand this blog. Rather than going through the code with, okay, USDC, they issued v two version of this. It's been a long time, obviously making this in 2023.
00:47:25.312 - 00:48:10.212, Speaker B: I don't know what year you are watching this, but yeah, USDC V two version. USDC smart contracts. Why they were able to, how they were able to upgrade this contract. As I know if you are little confused, if the smart contracts are immutable yes, they are immutable, but there are certain functions that is proxy contract that you can use. So what you can do is users just use this proxy contract, and this proxy contract just transfers or delegates all the calls that are present. Like whatever the call is that delegates call to another smart contract. And then you can change the point of the contract.
00:48:10.212 - 00:48:12.956, Speaker B: Like you can change the actual implementation contract.
00:48:13.068 - 00:48:13.728, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:13.894 - 00:48:58.232, Speaker B: Whatever this contract, proxy contract is pointing to, that you can change that whenever you have any new version, just like this, you have this old version, user doesn't understand, like just on the back end side stuff is going on. User doesn't understand what is this stuff. So for user it is, nothing has changed. There might be extra functionalities, extra functions that you can call as a user. But yeah, this is like simple stuff how proxy contract works. There is delegate call to another address, and if you have a v two version, you can directly point it to another, the new smart contract of the next version. Then it delegates call to that smart contract.
00:48:58.232 - 00:49:32.936, Speaker B: Okay, one of the thing is that these smart contracts, the proxy smart contracts are very dangerous. Yes, they are dangerous. It is recommended to only use proxy contract until and unless it is not required. Like you only use proxy contract until there is no other way. It is very dangerous. There are a lot of hacks that has happened, a lot of bugs due to that are exploited in the proxy contract. So yeah, don't use it unless you don't need it.
00:49:32.936 - 00:49:59.330, Speaker B: Storage lots like that is one of the problem with smart contract. I am planning to create one video on storage lot. I will definitely do it after this crash course. Okay. Talks about simply the storage lots about the stuff, more of the technical stuff. Let's not go through that. I mean, it's just solidity specific.
00:49:59.330 - 00:50:53.776, Speaker B: So I guess if there is something useful, it talks about some useful functions that they changed in the V two version. I don't know if there is anything, it just says how the USDC V two version is implemented. Right, so this is the working of this stuff, right? How the USDC V two contract is upgradable and was deployed, and other stuff that you can check out. Okay, this is like the upgrade process flowchart, which you can check out if you are a developer. It must be very important to you to understand how these smart contract functions, smart contract upgradation takes place. It is very important. Okay, so I guess this is all about this V two version.
00:50:53.776 - 00:51:29.320, Speaker B: There were new features in the smart contract that I wanted to talk about, but I couldn't find any major differences. I guess there were some functions that were introduced. I guess increased devices was one of them, decreased was one of them. Permit was one of them. Canceling authorization was one of them. So yeah, this was like most important changes and V two version. This was more of I guess not much expansion or much useful for users.
00:51:29.320 - 00:52:07.192, Speaker B: I don't see it much useful for users. But yeah, if you want to actually explore this smart contract might be useful for you to understand. And actually if you do research, if you found something special in me too, find out and just comment below YouTube video, just scratch course so that other people can understand or post on Twitter and LinkedIn. Tag me, tell me if I'm wrong. Tell me if I'm not wrong. I would love to see if people are learning from my yeah, let's move on to our next stable coin. I guess one thing is left.
00:52:07.246 - 00:52:07.860, Speaker A: Yes.
00:52:08.030 - 00:53:00.200, Speaker B: So recently circle, the organization behind USDC, they launched new stuff that is Ethereum, that is cross chain transfer protocol, that is also known as CCTP crosschain transfer protocol. So this is like the latest crosschain usage transfer protocol for Ethereum, our launch. So basically right now, I don't know if you know how bridges work usually, right. Let me actually take and explain it to you guys. Just give me a moment. Okay. So now let's talk about why this USDC new feature called CTP crossing transfer protocol is actually very useful and why it is maybe going to be a game changer.
00:53:00.200 - 00:53:29.664, Speaker B: Because I want to understand first of all how the actual bridges work. Like how the simple bridges working of the bridges is. So for example, let's talk about polygon bridge, right? I know about it little much. So let's actually talk about it. So for example, imagine that you have your ethereum, okay, I'm a little terrible at it. I just recently watched the tablet. So yeah, please bear with me with my handwriting.
00:53:29.664 - 00:54:09.632, Speaker B: Okay, so you have Ethereum on Polygon network, okay, so you have your ethereum on polyure network, and then what you want to do is you want to transfer your ethereum to actually ethereum network or Ethereum. Whenever people say ethereum, that is not a good thing. Ether is the token and the ethereum is the network. So yeah, suppose you have Ethereum on the Polygon network and you want to transfer your token to Ethereum network itself. So how usually this will work is that what will happen?
00:54:09.686 - 00:54:09.904, Speaker A: Is.
00:54:09.942 - 00:54:18.352, Speaker B: So there is no actual bridge, there is actually no flow of tokens, there is just bridges.
00:54:18.416 - 00:54:18.788, Speaker A: Right?
00:54:18.874 - 00:54:38.572, Speaker B: We just say bridges. For example, this is the Polygon network. This is Ethereum network. So there is actually no flow of tokens. Don't feel like there is actually a flow of token. The Ethereum has been gone to polygon chain, to the Ethereum chain. This is not happening.
00:54:38.572 - 00:55:13.408, Speaker B: This is not how it works. So what usually happens is that this is the Polygon chain and this is for example, the Ethereum chain. So what will happen is suppose you want to transfer your token from Polygon to Ethereum, or Ethereum to polygon, whatever it is. For example, let's say you want to transfer it from Ethereum to polygon. So what will happen is that you have 100 ether. That's a lot, but yeah, suppose you have 100 ether here. So what you will do is there will be a smart contract on the Ethereum network.
00:55:13.408 - 00:55:29.908, Speaker B: So what you will do is what the bridge will usually do is the back end side of the things. Bridge doesn't show you this. So it will take 100 ether, it will lock it into the smart contract that is present on Ethereum network.
00:55:30.004 - 00:55:30.264, Speaker A: Right?
00:55:30.302 - 00:55:52.396, Speaker B: And then what it will do is like this smart contract, I don't know, we'll submit a proof to the polygon chain. So this is all the back end side. You submit as a user here. We just want this 100 ether you submitted to Ethereum smartcount Ethereum chain to be on the polygon chain. This is what you want, you want it to do on the polygon chain.
00:55:52.428 - 00:55:52.720, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:52.790 - 00:56:53.012, Speaker B: So what usually happens on the back end side is that your 100 ether will get locked in a smart contract on the Ethereum network. And then what will happen is that basically it will submit a proof or whatever the underlying thing of the polygon smart contract is. Following bridges. Simply what this will create a function like this will give a proof to smart contract here that, hey, this particular address, this particular user has actually logged 100 Ethereum on Ethereum network. So what you can do is you can issue the 100 Ethereum on the polygon chain itself. Okay, so this is how simply the transfer of token works. Like you can actually just take, let me take and just remove this.
00:56:53.012 - 00:56:55.056, Speaker B: All right, so this is terrible.
00:56:55.088 - 00:56:55.380, Speaker A: Pen.
00:56:55.450 - 00:57:40.404, Speaker B: Okay, so you can definitely choose between different color. Okay, so I have chosen, I don't know what color, but yeah, this is how usually it works. Like you have Ethereum, you call it network. It submits, approve or say that, hey, this address has actually locked some kind of theorem over here. So what you can do is you can just issue the smart contract, you can just sue the actual ether on this network as well. This is simply how bridges works. And this is how you transfer tokens from one network to another, right? So this is little complex and people say that it might get hacked and stuff.
00:57:40.404 - 00:58:05.144, Speaker B: So this is like, ethereum is a layer 1.1 is a layer two. This is like a simple transfer. But there are several widgets that do cross chain transfer of the things, cross chain transfer of the assets, like the, to another layer one, like avalanche Solana, like warm old bridge. We talked about that, right? So this is one of the things that happens. Okay, so this is like layer one to layer two. Maybe there's arbitrary optimals.
00:58:05.144 - 00:58:40.792, Speaker B: They have their own bridges, right? So this is actually, actually a safer bridge, safer side of the thing. This is how usually the bridges works. Okay, you allow this on theorem chain, you have this on, you get shoot the same thing on the polygon network. Now if you want to remove this, you want to take your ethereum again from Polygon network to Ethereum network back. What you can do is you can, hey, this is all on the backend side of the things. You will not see it as a user. You will not see all this stuff.
00:58:40.792 - 00:59:29.652, Speaker B: It's simple Ui for you, right? So what will happen is that your ethereum that are present on the polygon network, it will get burned on your 100 ether, it will get burned on the polygon network. It will get burned on the polygon network. Why is this pen not working? Okay, so this is a terrible pen. I will have to change some setting, but yeah, bear with me. So your 100 ether will get burned on the Ethereum network. And then this will actually submit a proof on the Ethereum chain that, hey, this 100 liter has been burned. And then when this burn proof, okay, this burn proof will be submitted on the Ethereum network.
00:59:29.652 - 01:00:12.996, Speaker B: Once this burn proof is submitted here, then your ethereum, like then your ethereum that was locked in here, that will be unlocked. Okay, unlocked. So this proof is very important, like whenever the transfer is happening. So this proof will be very important to unlock this ether on the Ethereum chain itself. Okay, so this is the simple working of bridges. I know it's a little terrible in drawing, but yeah, I will get better once I start using it on daily basis. I might do it in the future sections, I don't know.
01:00:12.996 - 01:00:23.640, Speaker B: But yeah, this is simply how bridges work. Now let's actually go back to CTP and let's see what it does. And how is that working?
01:00:23.710 - 01:00:24.184, Speaker A: Okay.
01:00:24.302 - 01:00:31.156, Speaker B: Okay, so let's talk about this circle's CTP thing. Okay, USDC transfer protocol for Ethereum avalanche.
01:00:31.188 - 01:00:31.432, Speaker A: Right?
01:00:31.486 - 01:01:01.044, Speaker B: This is, I guess just launched for transfer from ethereum to avalanche. Like your USDC transfer from Ethereum to avalanche. So let's talk about this circle TCPP thing, USDC transfer. So it just explains all the working in just one. This new protocol burns coins on the sending chain and mints the new ones on the receiving chain. And how this is actually better than bridges. I don't know if it is better than not.
01:01:01.044 - 01:01:43.676, Speaker B: It will have to prove its technology. There is no actually locking of the smart contract, like locking of the tokens. We understand, right. If you want to transfer your assets from Ethereum to polychain, you have to lock your token, your crypto on the Ethereum chain, and then you can get the same amount of token minted on the other chain. Okay, so this is how usually the bridges work. But here you're not locking anything, you're not locking the USDC on the Ethereum chain, and then you are getting the same amount of USDC on the chain. You are just burning it, right? Just literally burning it and then issuing new amount of token on the receiving chain.
01:01:43.676 - 01:02:33.856, Speaker B: So it's better in terms of security as well. We'll also talk about what are the disadvantages and what are the dangerous thing about this new stuff. But yeah, this simply says like previous large users who had USDT and Ethereum had to deposit their coin with circle partner and use a third party bridge. So rather than now this USDC is just present, right? So now the users don't have to use 23rd party bridges to transfer their USDC from one network to another. There is like inbuilt function of this new stable coin. So this is, I guess one of the good feature, good thing that is happening in the crypto industry if we are moving towards not using third party things for two. Apparently they showed a video regarding new protocol.
01:02:33.856 - 01:02:53.668, Speaker B: I mean, there is a link to this. I will provide this link to this blog as well. You can check this out. Before this blog, there was video closure that they launched that showed how you can actually transfer the token from large to ethereum.
01:02:53.764 - 01:02:54.264, Speaker A: Right?
01:02:54.382 - 01:03:25.572, Speaker B: So yeah, I was talking about this bridges things. So the users have lost billions of dollars like worth of USDC or any other cryptocurrencies as well in general over bridges, hacks. So bridges are one of the most controversial or hacking stuff happens on bridges, right. It is very tough and it is one of the most important topics that the industry is trying to solve. Bridges like crosshair interoperability, crosshair transfer.
01:03:25.706 - 01:03:26.148, Speaker A: Right.
01:03:26.234 - 01:04:27.152, Speaker B: There are several bridges that have claimed to be safe, but you don't know things can happen, things can change in time. Crypto, like farmhold was one of the bridge that is like the safest, the most famous bridge, but it also got hacked. I guess it's a matter of time when the wild attackers are hackers, they find out the bugs. All other hackers, they exploit it, right? So just a matter of time. And yeah, users have lost millions of dollars worth and these attacks on bridges and figuratively, like how they have lost a lot of money, because usually in the bridges, your tokens are locked inside it, logged in a smart contract. And if that smart contract has been exploited in the bridge hack, then your tokens or users tokens are lost.
01:04:27.216 - 01:04:27.444, Speaker A: Right?
01:04:27.482 - 01:04:36.132, Speaker B: This is what symbol thing is. But in USDC, this thing, like in this stuff, there is no locking of the smart contract.
01:04:36.196 - 01:04:36.520, Speaker A: Right?
01:04:36.590 - 01:05:22.356, Speaker B: So that's why this has left developers wondering how to secure. This has left developers learning how to secure bridges for future asset users. Digital assets becoming more streamed. So if you want digital assets to become more streamed, we need to solve this problem. Nobody wants to lose their funds, right? Yeah, this is a good alternative, I guess, to traditional bridges, but yes, it's good, but there are little bit of things that also we need to discuss. And also one more thing is to keep in mind about this security. In terms of security, it is also scanning as well because it can also be attacked.
01:05:22.356 - 01:05:38.664, Speaker B: Not like it is very secure and can't get attacked. If it gets hacked, like the USDC smart contract issuer and all this stuff gets hacked, then the hacker can actually mint any amount of native USDC.
01:05:38.792 - 01:05:39.084, Speaker A: Right.
01:05:39.122 - 01:05:59.476, Speaker B: And off wrapping it would be tricky. It would be tricky. But it depends on how the attack is carried out and what time frame and all that stuff. But yeah, also one of the same thing as well. And also need to consider the configuration of CTP plus widget itself.
01:05:59.578 - 01:05:59.940, Speaker A: Okay.
01:06:00.010 - 01:06:20.520, Speaker B: You have to consider all the configurations of the stuff. And also after this vc crosschain transfer protocol, they moved, circle moved, one more step and they integrated bridge to actually do the crosschain transfer of assets.
01:06:20.600 - 01:06:20.940, Speaker A: Right.
01:06:21.010 - 01:06:23.164, Speaker B: So let's actually talk about that as well.
01:06:23.202 - 01:06:23.500, Speaker A: Okay.
01:06:23.570 - 01:06:56.192, Speaker B: So there was actually one of the video that was out there where it shows like. So I wanted to show you this demo that actually was on the Circles YouTube channel. It was with the CTP, actually integrates with varmhole to do transfer of the tokens. Like cross chain transfer of the tokens. So in this demo, it shows how you can transfer your ethereum from ethereum blockchain to avalanche blockchain.
01:06:56.256 - 01:06:56.532, Speaker A: Right.
01:06:56.586 - 01:07:25.148, Speaker B: And this is using the CTP protocol by circle, right? So I am not going to play this video fully. This is a five minute video. I will provide link to this, but you can check this out to check out the demo. It is good. Let's actually talk about the working of this. Okay, so let's discuss how circle CCTP is integrated with Varmo. There's a crossing bridge, crossing transfer bridge.
01:07:25.148 - 01:08:20.924, Speaker B: So let's talk about how this works. Okay, so for example, we will be swapping native token from theorem to native token of our branch. So ether is the ETH is a native token on Ethereum blockchain, right. And then you want to transfer it, you basically want to swap it to Avax is the native token on the, okay, so this is the thing. So if you were to swap it, swap your ethereum, in Ethereum, you will get a derivative saying or basically a wrapped AWoX, right. Traditionally, right. I don't know if there are any other matters, but that is how traditionally you get an app version of our launch network.
01:08:20.924 - 01:08:44.650, Speaker B: Right, but what will happen with this circles CCTP is that let's remove this. So as a user, there is nothing much for you. For example, when you have Ethereum, you have eTh on Ethereum blockchain and you want the data token of our.
01:08:48.380 - 01:08:48.768, Speaker A: Chain.
01:08:48.804 - 01:09:38.236, Speaker B: So you just have to just provide ethereum to the platform. Like whatever the CTP just layer cake platform is, you just have to go and provide Ethereum to them and it will issue, you will get. Okay, so that's on the user side of the things. But how underlying is this working? So what this will do is simply what will happen is that there will be a swap for your ethereum. So there will be a swap for Ethereum and it will turn into USDC. USDC, okay, so it will turn into USDC and then what will happen? And in that it will use the circles cctv one. Let me just remove it.
01:09:38.236 - 01:10:30.700, Speaker B: Okay, so what will do is let me create a big line. Okay, so what it will do is it will use circus cctv transfer protocol that we just discussed. So what it directly does is that it will burn this USDC, it will burn this USDC and then it will mint the same amount of USDC, whatever the price of the USDC that was here, it will get minted here. Okay, so the same amount of USDC limit. So this is what the CCTP working this stuff, the CADC and CSec minting, this is how CCTP usually works. But there is one extra step. There is in between.
01:10:30.700 - 01:11:07.472, Speaker B: Like there is so there is one more step here using wamhole. What it will do is it will directly just swap your USDC that was minted here on the avalanche network. And it will directly swap it to. So here now you're getting actually not any wrapped version of avalanche. Not any wrapped version of Avalanche. You're directly getting the original native token of the avalanche network.
01:11:07.616 - 01:11:08.032, Speaker A: Right?
01:11:08.106 - 01:11:44.704, Speaker B: So this is how the CTP actually works. So yeah, this is all about CTPP versus. I hope you are enjoying this crash course. If yes, just post this screenshot on Twitter and LinkedIn and let me know if you like it in the comment section. Just like if you like this. I know the Internet is sad because I recently, just today only bought this pen and my tablet just to teach more of you guys. Okay, so now let's move on to our next topic.
01:11:44.704 - 01:12:20.110, Speaker B: So I guess we have covered almost everything under the fiat collectorized stable coin that is USDT. USDC. And you have talked about amazing stuff of USDC, this, all these amazing features, new features. I'm trying to keep it as updated as possible. So yeah, I guess let's now move on to another type of stable coin. Okay, so actually, before moving on to our next topic, I wanted to discuss this USDT and band analysis that I found on doom.com. It's a really good website to find stuff.
01:12:20.110 - 01:12:52.900, Speaker B: You can visit the website and just a specific thing. So it shows the analysis of all the USDT and all the USDC band address. Right. You just went through the code of USDT and USDC where there was a function called blacklisted function. So this is actually, you can see all the details of all the addresses, all the USDT that was present in the right now the USDT band address is re 858. And on the other side 150 and on USDC.
01:12:52.980 - 01:12:53.512, Speaker A: Right.
01:12:53.646 - 01:13:25.476, Speaker B: And you can actually check the total amount of USDC. So actually visit the website of deal.com and let's see what the angle looks like. There are some amazing graphs that I found and it was actually amazing. So let me just share that. Okay, so USDC, USDP, total amount. So this is total amount is around $460,000,000.
01:13:25.476 - 01:14:06.112, Speaker B: And on the other side, USDC, which is about $8 million. Okay, still voting. But yes, you can see it over here and there is USDT address. It says that it is around 800, number 872. And then there is 150, around 163 and USDC. And you can see this cumulative stuff. And whenever they want, like USDC or USDT owner can actually balance this value or they can remove it from the black tasted stuff.
01:14:06.112 - 01:15:05.380, Speaker B: Okay, move on to the next topic. Okay, so now let's talk about next type of stable coin. That is commodity coins are collateralized using asset or any types of like for example, precautious matters, oils, real estate, anything. So the most popular commodity to do is definitely gold currency. Then cover us dollar was used to be backed by gold. So yeah, it is one of the most popular commodity. So tanzan gold are two of the most liquid gold bagged, stable commodities in the market.
01:15:05.380 - 01:15:21.720, Speaker B: However, it is important to remember that these commodities can and more likely to fluctuate in price, therefore have potential to lose value. I mean, you all know that gold prices can definitely fluctuate, right? So this is also. You need to keep that in mind.
01:15:21.790 - 01:15:22.120, Speaker A: Okay.
01:15:22.190 - 01:16:19.388, Speaker B: And the holders of Tessa gold can actually redeem their Tesla gold token tokens in exchange for physical gold if they complete the commodities process. There is commodities limited verification process that when once you complete and you have to hold certain amount of token that is around. And if you have that, and if you verify with the commodity verification process, you can actually redeem exchange for selling gold itself. This is one of the things that you need to keep in mind, I guess. Yeah, this is what the simple stuff is. What the current price I found out on the Internet. This is the market cap.
01:16:19.388 - 01:16:50.880, Speaker B: The market cap. And both of these are backed by gold, almost the same price. So yeah, this is also one of another type of stable coins in the market. Okay, so the rest is all about it. There is nothing as such code in this to talk about. But yeah, this is just significant for governmentalized stable coins. Okay, so now let's move on to another topic that is crypto collateralized serial coin.
01:16:50.880 - 01:17:39.364, Speaker B: This is like one of the most important topics and one of my favorite topics. So what is cryptocurrenized as? Simply the mean name suggest cryptocurrencies backed syriable coins are called as cryptocurrency as for example, any other cryptocurrency. So this cryptocurrency works similar to that of stable coins. However, it locks up cryptocurrency as collector instead of using fiat currency. For example, ethereum can be kept as collector to create cryptocurrency backed stable coins. For example, dai dai is one of the famous stable coins in the market by maker and up. Definitely talk about.
01:17:39.364 - 01:18:25.510, Speaker B: It's one of the interesting topics. So then they keep the signal one. Now they have a multicolored currency that is a collateral to issue. So this process offers more shape and employees smart contracts. Instead of relying on central issue. This is why this is more decentralized as compared to fiat based because everything is happening on chain, right? Things are moving from off chain word to onchain world. So people, our stable conscious also moved from offshore to and right now.
01:18:25.510 - 01:19:14.468, Speaker B: But right now we will talk only about this threshold. We will only talk about I because die is actually one of the most famous to cover and it will take a lot of time. So you should definitely go and explore. So this is, if you are watching this, if you're new to this spacebooks, just after this, we will explain title, how it works, and how technical, the size of things. Then you use your homework to find out how rye works, how bright is different than dieto token and how it works. Just post it on Twitter and post certain on LinkedIn. Tag me and I might have a gift for you to share.
01:19:14.468 - 01:19:50.030, Speaker B: I might give you something you want. We will ask for. So this is kind of a homework we use and tag me and tell that this is part of the homework that I gave to you. So yeah, just continue till we finish diet. So let's talk about diet token, how that works. Before moving on to the working of diet token, there are two things. There is one thing that is important to this.
01:19:50.030 - 01:20:49.388, Speaker B: So there are two types of types of color. One is exogenous, the other was endogenous. Okay, so if the stable coin fails, to find out what type of collateralization it is, you just have to ask one question. If the stable coins fails, does the underlying collector also fail? Okay, so this is a simple question that we have to ask every time to make sure what is exogenous and what is indulgence. So, for example, EtH is a collector, as I said, to issuing to issuing thai tokens, you can get ethereum as a collector. Like as we were getting actual fiat currency as a collateral for fiat bad one. We can have ethereum as a collateral over here, right? So if EtH has a collateral for die token, okay, if the die token fails, does eth fails?
01:20:49.564 - 01:20:50.448, Speaker A: No. Right?
01:20:50.534 - 01:21:10.936, Speaker B: I mean, helium doesn't have to do anything with the thing. It is exorgent. ETH still has a smart contract if the user uses it outside of die. And will it continue to thrive? No matter if dai goes down, dai goes up.
01:21:10.958 - 01:21:11.240, Speaker A: Okay.
01:21:11.310 - 01:22:07.156, Speaker B: The four e collateral is exogenous, and the other one is the underlying collateral of the stable by phase. For example, USDT, the underlying collector for USP, USP was Luna. If you talk about how Luna fall and all that stuff, and in the future one, we then talk about algorithmic stable coins, but for USD, USD is collateral, right? So if there are collateral fails, if the Collateral, the main stable coin fails, does the collateral fails? Yes, it failed. So in order to mint USD, you needed to burn Luna. And they were designed together at the protocol level, so very impact together. Right? So it was a kind of endogenous collector.
01:22:07.268 - 01:22:07.688, Speaker A: Right?
01:22:07.774 - 01:22:17.144, Speaker B: So this is a major difference. And I guess this is one of the things that you need to know if you want to understand stablecoins and the basics of stablecoins.
01:22:17.192 - 01:22:17.596, Speaker A: Okay.
01:22:17.698 - 01:22:51.476, Speaker B: Not if you are technical or non technical. This is a part. So yeah, now let's talk about diet token. As I said, let's talk about how Dai works. Okay, so Dai is one of the best known stablecoins in the most successful FBI projects in the past few years. And one of the best known stablecoins in the market, right? So it is a shoe token, one is Dai, this dai token, and the other one is Maker MKDR. So it's not a collateral.
01:22:51.476 - 01:23:47.964, Speaker B: Okay. Maker MKR is for the governance of the makerdao. So Makerdao is actually the party or the organization. This Dao, behind this stereo account, there have to be some person, right? So this maker Dow is the thing behind Dai stereo coin, okay, which actually makes it unique as each die is backed by Ethernet instead of third party. So this is instead of any third party like USDT organization or circular organization that they have required collateral, which we definitely, it's up to you. They want to show it or not having a third party claiming it. We have natively, not natively, but we have ether actually on chain showing that it is there.
01:23:47.964 - 01:24:36.420, Speaker B: Right. And one more thing to remember is that Dai is not an exchange, but Dai is not. Just to be clear for you and just theory, there are a lot of people on Twitter just make sure die is not tweet by Tai as well. So more than of the 2% of entire Ethereum, entire ETH is actually logged in the maker. That's all of the total market cap of Ethereum. All the total supply is actually logged in maker and all 2% of it is logged in in the maker. It is one of the most influential stable coin.
01:24:36.420 - 01:25:19.564, Speaker B: Stable gives the idea of how an ideal stable coin should look like. It is one of the influence of shibama coin to say, but it also has its effects. Sometimes it gets cpegged, right? So there is one thing, there is definitely bad side of everything, okay? But it actually is one of the high yield stable coins how should look like. Now let's talk about its working. Okay, so now let's understand the die token, how it usually works. So one more thing is that now die token is multi vector. Before that it was only accepting Ethereum as a collectible, but accepts few other cryptocurrencies as a collector.
01:25:19.564 - 01:25:51.468, Speaker B: We will talk about that as well. There is one cash in there. How this usually works is for the Ethereum one. So you have some kind of eth, then only you will able to go to Makerdao and get that token. Obviously you can invite it from third party marketplace design and coin with sector. But if you want to just directly get from Karadao. So what you do is to hacker and moon.
01:25:51.468 - 01:26:15.348, Speaker B: I got this images from hacker noon. So you can follow them. They have some amazing content and I'll provide a link in the description. So Stavan is basically, it's very simple. You have the user, you have some kind of ethereum, some amount of Ethereum. You will just deposit or send this ether to maker. Now, smart contract creating a CDP.
01:26:15.348 - 01:26:55.924, Speaker B: So CDP is an agreement just in which your collateral is logged in a smart contract to generate a stable coin. So it's just an agreement. Okay, so you open this CDP, once you submit this, once you submit your ethereum, the step two second what will happen is say for example, you deposited one ether. So one ether. Suppose for example, let's take this example, you have one ether and the dollar and the value of one ethereum is $150 as of now. Okay, let's consider it. So what will happen is this will actually allow you to take up 200 die because the collateral ratio is 150%.
01:26:55.924 - 01:27:30.160, Speaker B: So this collateral ratio, if you calculate it. So it will be around 150 divided by 1.5. Since the collateral issue is 150%. So you will be allowed to actually take up 100 die or mint up to 100 die. Assuming you have one ethereum, the value of Ethereum is $150 against your. You will get 100 usd. Hundred worth of 100 I is equals to one usd.
01:27:30.160 - 01:28:13.964, Speaker B: And this is basically the collateralization is on 50. We have to keep in mind this might change, hopefully. However, if the price right now the price is on $50, this is how the simple working. But however, if the price of ether drops below $150, your CDP will be forcefully closed. Okay? And this is limit beyond the users. This is actually the limit beyond the user is liquidator. Okay, so for example, you have this fund theorem is $150, right? And you just collect the maximum amount of limit.
01:28:13.964 - 01:29:08.604, Speaker B: The maximum amount of limit is $100, but you can only mint $100. You can actually $90, you can mint $50, you can. Okay, but the maximum limit. So if for example, you have $100 like we have submitted, we have one ethereum, you shoot the maximum amount, it is $100 itself. Okay, but if the price of ethereum goes below 150, then your CDP maybe collect position could be forcefully closed and it can get closed. Okay, so you lose your collateralization, that is your money. And this way it has always has some more collateral than actually the Dai borrowed or minted.
01:29:08.604 - 01:29:58.064, Speaker B: So this is very helpful because euros don't have the same amount of ethereum logged in the smart contract as the same amount of Dai shoe. You actually have more collateralized. So that's why it is an overcollectralized stable coin as well. And if you want to stop this from happening like you want this to happen, if you don't want your CDP to get forcefully closed, what you can do is you can put more ether or actually take out less in a first place. So we have 150 usd. So what you can do is if the price of one ether goes below 150 usd and you have already taken a maximum amount, you will have to submit more ethereum so that the collateralization ratio matches it.
01:29:58.102 - 01:29:58.448, Speaker A: Right.
01:29:58.534 - 01:30:36.252, Speaker B: So if you want it, you have to put out more ether to the stable coins, the smart contract of the Mikada smart contract. Or else you should take less amount of USDC. If you shoot less amount of die in the first place itself. If you have the limit of like 100 die token, then you should maybe mint 50. You should, whatever it is up to you. Just to ensure there's always enough capital locked against the amount of money being taken out. So this is actually very good and actually very stable as well.
01:30:36.252 - 01:31:02.372, Speaker B: You also have some more examples as well in the future. But yeah. Okay, so this step third, this is the step too simple. You have to submit the ether and then this is a collateral ratio. It depends on the maker and governance to find out. This collateral ratio changes I guess all the time. But yeah, this is how the second step is.
01:31:02.372 - 01:31:12.564, Speaker B: And then the third step is if you want to enter back, you don't want your right token. If you want to return back, you need to pay back the amount you took out with the addition of some minor fees.
01:31:12.612 - 01:31:13.064, Speaker A: Yes.
01:31:13.182 - 01:32:01.352, Speaker B: If you are issuing, if you're getting some diet token, you will have to pay some minor fee. So all the diet token supplying the supplies in the market, some of the money is actually paying the fees for that. Okay, so every year there is a 2% cebility fee. This is decided with the maker governance token. If you are worried about what is the use of maker Naki token, then it is a governance token and you can choose what will be the stability fee of the, what will be the stability fee of the governance of the makerdao and dow token. And also how much the CDP ratio is that we talked about. You couldn't vote on that kind of stuff.
01:32:01.352 - 01:32:42.404, Speaker B: So if you have maker token, okay, so the contract will directly burn your dietoker and will close your CDP and it will pay back all the ether that you have. The current price of the ether, obviously it will pay that much amount of ether. Okay, so whosoever needed to die anytime they are getting charged as of now. And yeah, this is all about how the stable coin actually works. The die stable coin, right. This is the simple working of the stable coin. And simple close CTP pays a stability fee and you can get your ethereum or any other collateral back.
01:32:42.404 - 01:32:47.564, Speaker B: Okay, now let's actually move on to the code walkthrough of Di Token.
01:32:47.712 - 01:33:26.772, Speaker C: So now let's move on to understanding the Dai smart contract and the code of that. So for that, first of all, I tried reaching out to Makerdao people because the code of Makerdao governance and Dai token is a little complex. So first of all, I tried to reaching out to them. Maybe someone is available to come and teach in this crash course, but I got no response. So I myself got into their docs, tried to understand how it actually works. It is a little bit of complex, but yeah, we will get through it. Okay, but still right now you're still in this course, you are liking it.
01:33:26.772 - 01:33:57.880, Speaker C: Then please share it on LinkedIn and Twitter. And also do like this video. This will help the algorithm to show it to the other people and do comment as well. Thank you so much. And now let's actually let me share my screen. So I am on GitHub of Makerdao and under DSS I have opened DSS die stablecoin system. So under that I am on die sole contract.
01:33:57.880 - 01:34:24.020, Speaker C: Die is an ERC 20 token on Ethereum. And this is like the ERC 20 token contract of die. This includes everything that has the ERC 20 token has like simple functions, transfer from mint burn and all that stuff as well. But there are little, it's actually connected to other smart contracts as well. So now let's directly go through the Dai like Makerdao website.
01:34:24.090 - 01:34:25.876, Speaker B: They have some technical docs that are.
01:34:25.898 - 01:34:59.164, Speaker C: Actually present in there. But before that, before moving that, I went to the website and I found this Pdf which was actually an interesting one that explains a lot of technical stuff about Dai and maker Dao, how that actually works. So I will link that in the description. So if you are interested to learn about that, you can definitely visit it. And you should visit it. Okay, so there was some comparison between PSi and Dai. I already told you that PSi was actually single collateral Dai.
01:34:59.164 - 01:35:09.184, Speaker C: So before that, right now Makerdao supports multicolateral, which means that you can put different types of asset as collateral.
01:35:09.312 - 01:35:09.990, Speaker A: Right?
01:35:10.840 - 01:35:19.364, Speaker C: But before this, before sometimes it was only accepting ethereum as the only collateral.
01:35:19.412 - 01:35:19.672, Speaker A: Right?
01:35:19.726 - 01:35:36.792, Speaker C: So as you can see the differences here, single collector type is backing by a single collateral collector was eth. And here after it becomes multicolateral, it can be backed by multiple collections, different types of collectors that are obviously approved.
01:35:36.856 - 01:35:39.132, Speaker B: By the makerdao as well.
01:35:39.186 - 01:35:39.790, Speaker A: Okay.
01:35:40.320 - 01:35:47.152, Speaker C: And then there are definitely some advantages as well over multicoloral dai as well.
01:35:47.206 - 01:35:47.472, Speaker A: Right.
01:35:47.526 - 01:36:21.864, Speaker C: So you can definitely check that out. I mean, there are some differences. Like before, in single collectoral die maker MKR token, maker governance token was used to pay the stabilization fee, if you remember if we talked about the stabilization fee. And in multicolor die, we used Dai to pay the stability fee. Okay, so there are some few differences and then some terminologies that are not important to us as well. There are a lot of things to read about it. If you go deep, there are endless possibilities.
01:36:21.864 - 01:36:30.492, Speaker C: And this crash course could become like, I don't know, 24 hours crash course. So it's a lot to discuss. But yeah, let's focus on the main points as well.
01:36:30.546 - 01:36:30.728, Speaker A: Right.
01:36:30.754 - 01:36:57.796, Speaker C: So I have wrote down some main points there. So this diagram is actually a good example of how the Dai stable coins totally works. Like how it coordinates with several smart contract and other stuff. So these all are like, most of them are smart contracts, like wet. We will talk about that. We will talk about several other stuff as well. But we are not going to talk about everything because it becomes very hard to talk about everything.
01:36:57.898 - 01:36:58.212, Speaker A: Right.
01:36:58.266 - 01:37:17.532, Speaker C: So this is like a good example. There are different modules as well that we are going to talk about. And there is something called emergency shutdown module as well. Like you can see here, the end one. So this is like the emergency shutdown module. The shutdown stuff that we will talk about. That is one of the interesting thing that I got to know.
01:37:17.532 - 01:37:29.330, Speaker C: Now let's actually move on to the documentation again of Makerdao. Okay, just a Second. Okay, so this is the actual.
01:37:32.260 - 01:37:32.624, Speaker B: So.
01:37:32.662 - 01:37:59.896, Speaker C: This is actually the die Sol token that we were actually looking on GitHub. So this is just an introductory to that. Like it is an ERC 20 token contract, minting the count for external die balances and other stuff. And then this is the architecture. This isn't the whole architecture, but this is just interaction with the Dai one, if you will, to see it. Interaction of the die with the wet. Now what is wet? Just a second.
01:37:59.896 - 01:38:30.928, Speaker C: We are going to talk about it in a bit. Okay, this is like the contract details. If you are interested, you should visit the documentation as well, right? These are just key mechanics and simple concepts that you can go and talk about. This includes some differences. What are some differences from a simple ERC 20 token? Like transfer from indicate works in slightly different form than generic transfer from function. It allows for unlimited approval rather than limited approval.
01:38:31.024 - 01:38:31.332, Speaker A: Right.
01:38:31.386 - 01:38:47.332, Speaker C: So there are some differences that you can check out. Like push, pull and move are elices for transfer from calls in the form of transfer form. Yeah, there is a little difference that you can check out, but yeah, most of them is the same.
01:38:47.486 - 01:38:47.948, Speaker A: Right.
01:38:48.034 - 01:38:58.220, Speaker C: So now let's talk about wet, right. That you are seeing this wet. This is a very important stuff that we should talk about.
01:38:58.290 - 01:38:58.910, Speaker A: Okay.
01:39:01.360 - 01:39:03.128, Speaker C: So this is the core modules, right?
01:39:03.154 - 01:39:04.496, Speaker B: So let me just tell you one.
01:39:04.518 - 01:39:37.208, Speaker C: Thing that if you see the documentation of mechadot, there are different modules as well. Like core modules, collector module, right? And oracle module. There are different types of oracle under the DSS, right? So you can declare out. That was also in the diagram that we were talking about, right. You can see here the different types of modules. Like this module is different system stabilizer, right? There is one oracle module. So there must be an oracle module is over here, right? And then there is a shutdown, one emergency shutdown module as well.
01:39:37.208 - 01:40:04.436, Speaker C: So there are different modules that combine altogether. Now let's talk about this wet. What is this main thing called? Wet. So wet is actually the single source of truth for the maker protocol, as it says here. Like wet in general is defined as a large tank or a tub to hold liquid, right. You can see here it's very usual, very common. We will see it out there.
01:40:04.436 - 01:40:40.344, Speaker C: So this is called actually wet. So wet actually holds all the fundamental primitives of the Makerdao protocol. So it's just like a source to put everything inside it. Like it contains the accounting system of the core vault, like internal tie balances. What is the collateral state? Everything is in the wet, right. And this wet, there are different functions as well of wet as well. It also contains some public interfaces allowing vault owners to transfer, split and merge the different vaults.
01:40:40.344 - 01:40:56.080, Speaker C: Okay, so now there are some fundamental primitives of the maker protocol. The wet holds these fundamental primitives. These are like database. And then there is accounting system that we talked about. Vault management, vault fungibility.
01:40:56.160 - 01:40:56.452, Speaker A: Right.
01:40:56.506 - 01:41:23.656, Speaker C: These are some things that we talk about. And this is what wet is for. Now, let's also go to the documentation as well and see what that has to say about wet as well. So there is a detailed documentation about wet in the maker documentation page. So wet is like the core vault engine of DSS. DSS is dice stablecoin system. So that is actually the core vault engine of the DSS.
01:41:23.768 - 01:41:24.332, Speaker B: Right.
01:41:24.466 - 01:41:39.612, Speaker C: It stores vaults, and it tracks all the associated DAi and collateral balances. So all the associated DAi that we talked about, that you have to put some collateral, some crypto collateral to mint the dai token. So all the tracks are in this wet contract.
01:41:39.676 - 01:41:40.000, Speaker A: Okay.
01:41:40.070 - 01:41:46.512, Speaker C: It also defies the rules by which words can be manipulated. So it act as a constitution of the DSS.
01:41:46.576 - 01:41:46.756, Speaker A: Right?
01:41:46.778 - 01:41:58.276, Speaker C: So this wet is actually constitution of the dice table coin system. And also, one more thing is that it is immutable, which means that it can't be changed.
01:41:58.308 - 01:41:58.504, Speaker A: Right.
01:41:58.542 - 01:42:02.628, Speaker C: That's why it is viewed as a constitution of the DSS.
01:42:02.724 - 01:42:03.032, Speaker A: Right.
01:42:03.086 - 01:42:38.980, Speaker C: And there are some glossary, some terms that if you want to talk about gem and all that stuff, you can also even visit the wet smart contract as well. I hope so. Yeah. This is the wet sole smart contract that you can visit if you want to check stuff. So watts is something that only can call the authorized functions, right? So these are some watts and there are some other glossaries as well. If you want, you can go through this, and then if you are unable to understand anything. And this is smart contract.
01:42:38.980 - 01:42:49.992, Speaker C: This includes math and this administration function that we were talking about. So only the watts can call these functions as well.
01:42:50.046 - 01:42:50.264, Speaker A: Right.
01:42:50.302 - 01:43:18.752, Speaker C: And then there are some other functions as well that you can check out. And, yeah, if you are unable to find anything, like if you are unable to understand anything, one thing, one tip that I can give it to you is that just go to this McMakerdao glossaries that is at the end. And here are different several terms that you can understand. If we go through in this video, it will take a lot of time. So just go through here. Just do control f. And then you can search whatever you want.
01:43:18.752 - 01:43:34.116, Speaker C: If you want to search wet, this will give you thousands of words. So you can actually understand what that stuff is. Okay, so wet is just like a large tank to hold everything. And it acts as a constitution as well.
01:43:34.138 - 01:43:35.444, Speaker B: And a single source of truth.
01:43:35.492 - 01:44:11.280, Speaker C: For the maker protocol. Okay, so we have covered this and now let's actually talk about cat. So after wet, there is one more component that is cat. So cat is vaults that are too risky, right? So let's read this paragraph. The donator of vault owner and borrower. While the smart contract system is generated to increase the borrower's confidence in the minted value, if the value of the underlying asset dips below the required amount, the collateralization ratio decreases. To increase this ratio, we already had an example.
01:44:11.280 - 01:45:16.924, Speaker C: We talked about this, right? So to increase this ratio, prevent insolvency of the system, the generator takes via the cat the collateral and sells it for dai in an auction. So this cat contract is acting as a medium or what to say interface something, right? So that the collateral can be sold out, right? So if the system, like the generator, takes the collateral via the cat smart contract. So this is the importance of the cat smart contract, right? And then it sells it for die in an auction, right? So this is what simple the cat is. Let me see if that is also present on the Makerdao documentation under any module. No, I don't see it, but yeah, that's the simple one. If you still want to learn more about cats or soul, if you want to visit the docu or the smart contract, then it must be here somewhere. Yeah, this is cat soul.
01:45:16.924 - 01:45:30.376, Speaker C: If you want, you can check it out. So there are some different stuff. Crazy namings. Crazy namings of the things. So you can check out that.
01:45:30.398 - 01:45:31.944, Speaker B: And again, if you are unable to.
01:45:31.982 - 01:46:26.028, Speaker C: Find anything, in order to understand anything, one good thing is to go to the glossary and search here. It is definitely going to help you. Okay, now the next thing that we are going to talk about is spotter, right? So what is a spotter? In simple, like in realized spotter is someone who spots someone and means to physically help them in safely competing skills. So spotter is this guy who's helping this sportsman person in terms of safety, right? So this is what a spotter is. And here also, the maker protocol requires real time information about the market price of the assets used as collector and wallets, right? Ultimately, this market price determines the amount of data that can be minted, right? So you need some kind of price as well. Like the smart contracts need to know. If you haven't watched my EVM crash course, go and watch that.
01:46:26.028 - 01:46:44.704, Speaker C: It actually talks about how contracts cannot access the previous state or an external API or anything, right? So that's why we need oracles to get the price on chain, right? So yeah, there are oracle modules that handles how market prices are recorded on the blockchain.
01:46:44.752 - 01:46:45.012, Speaker B: Definitely.
01:46:45.066 - 01:47:17.656, Speaker C: And then spotter is simply an interface contract where external actors pull the current market price from the Oracle module for a specified collateral type. So it reads the market price from the spotter. Okay, that's a very simple thing. Let's go there and let me just show you what is written here. So it's like between a license, between the oracle and the core contract. So there must be some oracle stuff as well. So this is the spot that basically act as lies in between the oracles and the core contracts.
01:47:17.656 - 01:47:24.492, Speaker C: It functions as an interface contract and only stores the current ilk list. Ilkins is the collateral.
01:47:24.556 - 01:47:24.880, Speaker B: Basically.
01:47:24.950 - 01:47:48.616, Speaker C: It's nothing, just collateral. Okay, so it acts as basically as an interface or lies in between the oracle and the Corusmart contract. Let's also go to the architecture here, see where is a spot. Okay, so this is spot that is basically help acting as providing. Yeah, so this is the Oracle module here.
01:47:48.638 - 01:47:49.992, Speaker B: You can see that this is green.
01:47:50.046 - 01:48:00.136, Speaker C: Ones are the Oracle module. This is basically acting as a license between the wet, our tub that holds everything and the Oracle modules.
01:48:00.168 - 01:48:01.580, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
01:48:01.730 - 01:48:25.030, Speaker C: Now let's move on to our next thing. That is emergency shutdown. Okay, so there are a lot of other stuff as well that you can check out. I mean this PDF contains a lot of good stuff. If you want to definitely technically go into lot of details. I mean it's up to you. If you have free time, you should go into it.
01:48:25.030 - 01:49:04.764, Speaker C: So there are a lot of good stuff in this module. It basically explains everything about the maker dow working and different types of stuff. Like wow, what is that? You must be finding this inside the soul. I guess there must be a lot of different stuff that you can talk about. But yeah, I really want to talk about the emergency shutdown. But before that lets me go to the, so here, as I told you that there are different types of modules as well. Like oracle module, proxy module, peg, stability module.
01:49:04.764 - 01:49:24.704, Speaker C: So you will find all those module in this pdfs. Like if you want to understand what is Oracle module, you can check out here and there are different components as well like medianizer, OSM, Oracle security module. So you can check out all that stuff like maker MKL module.
01:49:24.752 - 01:49:24.916, Speaker A: Right?
01:49:24.938 - 01:49:35.896, Speaker C: So this is like the governance one. If you are interested in the governance side of the things, you can check out that and then, yeah, now let's actually talk about the emergency one that.
01:49:35.918 - 01:49:37.000, Speaker B: I wanted to talk about.
01:49:37.070 - 01:49:45.560, Speaker C: This is the jug and the pot one. These are, I guess the rates module. Yeah, this rates module is responsible for collecting the stability fee.
01:49:45.640 - 01:49:45.932, Speaker A: Right.
01:49:45.986 - 01:50:10.196, Speaker C: We will talk about when we talk about the architecture. Okay, now this is the proxy module. If you still don't know what is proxy, then go and check it out on YouTube. Just proxy module. I guess there must be some proxy contracts so that in future if there is an upgrade, so these proxy contracts can help in doing that. And then there is emergency shutdown. Okay, that's what I wanted to talk about.
01:50:10.196 - 01:50:16.256, Speaker C: So emergency shutdown is the last resort to protect the system against serious threats.
01:50:16.288 - 01:50:17.688, Speaker B: So suppose for example there is a.
01:50:17.694 - 01:50:30.408, Speaker C: Hack or there is something that is maybe a governance attack or security breach or something. Then there is this emergency shutdown button, maybe just a danger button that you can use.
01:50:30.494 - 01:50:30.792, Speaker A: Right?
01:50:30.846 - 01:51:10.872, Speaker C: So yeah, I wanted to talk about that. There are different components inside that. And there is some esm calls as well. Function which you can top, which freezes the protocol and locks all the spot prices like collateral, USD prices for each ilks, nothing but any collateral type. Right. When you call that function, it freezes the protocol and locks all the prices of that. And then after that, there is one thing of the component in the emergency shutter, there is ESM that we talked about, the emergency shutdown module, which you can find in the diagram as well.
01:51:10.872 - 01:51:37.328, Speaker C: The ESM. This is the emergency shutdown module which can be acted as in the case of emergency, right, in the malicious governance and the attack facilitated by our critical work. So maker holders lock their FDR in this emergency shutdown module and then are immediately burned. And when the ESM's internal sum balance is equal or greater than the minimum threshold, then the n cage function can be called.
01:51:37.414 - 01:51:37.904, Speaker A: Okay.
01:51:38.022 - 01:51:59.770, Speaker C: And there must be ESM contract. If you want to check out. Let's hop over there as well. Okay, so this is like the ESM, different repo for that. Okay, so this is emergency shutdown module contract with the ability to end cage. That is trigger and emergency shutdown that you can check out. There must be the smart contracts in there.
01:51:59.770 - 01:52:03.156, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, so this is the ESM.
01:52:03.268 - 01:52:04.984, Speaker B: Hole you can check out.
01:52:05.022 - 01:52:33.840, Speaker C: This is smart contract as well. This looks like interesting. So if it is something that is interesting to you, do check it out. So there is like join function. Join is actually for the responsible, actually it is a rate module that we are going to talk about and responsible for collecting stability fees. So it is there as well. And yeah, there are different functions, lot to cover.
01:52:33.840 - 01:53:01.316, Speaker C: I even don't know what half of the function does. So if you are really interested into understanding the smart contract, the actual working of this. Then you should definitely also join the discord server of these guys and they hold some meetings. I guess I joined one of them. So you can ask your live questions over there. Now let's move on to the overall diagram that we were talking about. So this is the wet that we have already discussed.
01:53:01.316 - 01:53:35.392, Speaker C: This is the end emergency shutdown modules in case of any emergency. Now this is the CDP manager. So CDP manager, we talked about that. It actually is the governance kind of the things. And it manages all the CDP collectorized depth position that opens that we have already talked about what are cdps? And this jagged pot actually is responsible for collecting the stability fees. These are rates modules. And then this is more of like the governance module stuff.
01:53:35.466 - 01:53:36.184, Speaker A: Right.
01:53:36.382 - 01:54:09.100, Speaker C: And then the spot that we have already talked about it act as interface or between wall as an oracle to the wet so that the wet can get the prices of the oracle, like the real life prices so that it can actually check out how much amount of DAI can be minted instead of the collateral that you have that has been submitted to the Makerdao smart contract.
01:54:09.180 - 01:54:10.144, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
01:54:10.182 - 01:54:46.476, Speaker C: So I guess this is all about it. Just an overview. Obviously I'm not going deep because it's a lot to cover on even. It took me a while to understand this stuff and to understand this architecture. What are this different stuff or what is happening? So yeah, if you want to get a technical deep dive, then do tag me on Twitter and tag the know Twitter account and tell them to come onto my YouTube channel. Then we can have a talk and they can help us understand this smart contract. And this also, you will not find it on YouTube as well.
01:54:46.476 - 01:54:51.004, Speaker C: This is like the first video someone has created that is actually talking about.
01:54:51.042 - 01:54:52.488, Speaker B: The architecture of Mekadao.
01:54:52.504 - 01:55:04.644, Speaker C: Even on the Mekadao's YouTube, nobody has talked about this stuff. They obviously have ppts and good documentation, but nobody has created a video around this. I guess this is the first viewer that you are going to get on.
01:55:04.682 - 01:55:05.028, Speaker A: Okay.
01:55:05.114 - 01:55:29.644, Speaker C: And these arrows also means something like government calls are represented by governance calls are represented by the red arrows, the public calls, public calls and the authorization calls as well. That is represented by the black arrows. So I will actually provide the link to all this stuff in the YouTube description. So if you want to understand this, do visit it.
01:55:29.682 - 01:55:30.268, Speaker A: Okay.
01:55:30.434 - 01:55:38.508, Speaker C: And there is now one interesting case that I want to talk about. So let's actually move on to our presentation pack.
01:55:38.594 - 01:55:38.892, Speaker B: Okay.
01:55:38.946 - 01:56:22.456, Speaker C: I have a good diagram that I want to talk about. There is a unique case regarding the multicolateral Dai. Okay, so let me just share my screen. Okay, so I wanted to talk regarding this wrapped bitcoin case, right? So there is one important case with the introduction of multi collector die that you could actually use any ERC token to collateralize your cdp. I also have a diagram for that that I have created. So let me also just show that diagram to you guys that will help you to understand what I am trying to say. My drawing skills are a little bit bad, so please bear it with me.
01:56:22.456 - 01:56:49.552, Speaker C: But yeah, I hope you're able to understand the diagram. I will tell you what this diagram is all about. One important case that I wanted to discuss was after the introduction of multicolateral die, you could actually use any approved tokens to collateralize your CDP, right? Collateralized wrapped position. And on my 2020, the Makerdog government actually announced that they are going to accept wrapped bitcoin as a collector.
01:56:49.616 - 01:56:50.230, Speaker A: Okay.
01:56:52.040 - 01:57:38.836, Speaker C: What is wrong with this? Just simply as using any other token is collected. But there is something that I wanted to talk about. So using wrapped bitcoin, so suppose there is an individual, whoever it is, you have bright wrapped bitcoin, you use that as a collateral. You open the CDP, whatever the collateralization ratio is, you give your smart contract, you give your wrapped bitcoin as a collector into the maker smart contract. And then, you know, mint Dai based on the collateralization or whatever it is. But this could actually result in under collateralized CTP issues if the issuers are forced to freeze the assets that are present in the Makerdao smart contract. So for example, the SEC.
01:57:38.836 - 01:57:42.308, Speaker C: So maybe tomorrow the SEC, there is something wrong.
01:57:42.474 - 01:57:43.190, Speaker B: Maybe.
01:57:45.080 - 01:57:55.076, Speaker C: They will tell maybe the bitcoin, the issuer of the Rev to bitcoin to maybe freeze the assets that are present in the Makerdao smart contract. Like the wrapped bitcoin.
01:57:55.108 - 01:57:55.304, Speaker A: Right?
01:57:55.342 - 01:58:31.728, Speaker C: So in this case, the bitcoin, the organization, the issuer behind the wrapped bitcoin will be forced to actually freeze those assets and blacklist all the wrapped bitcoin blacklist this Makerdao address, right? So what this will result is that once this bitcoin, they blacklist the wrapped bitcoin from the Makerdao address. What this means is that all this wrapped bitcoin that are actually present in the Makerdao address that is backing the CDP will be worthless.
01:58:31.824 - 01:58:32.132, Speaker A: Right?
01:58:32.186 - 01:58:34.036, Speaker C: So that is actually a big problem.
01:58:34.138 - 01:58:34.644, Speaker A: Right?
01:58:34.762 - 01:59:50.940, Speaker C: So in the ethereum case, this doesn't happen. But what if this is blacklisted and this wrapped bitcoin that you are using to collateralize your CDP after the government, or maybe this is a case as usual case, maybe there are less chances to it, but it can happen, right? So once the wrapped bitcoin is blacklisted from the maker, now address all these wrapped bitcoin that are backing the CDP will become worthless. So this will create chaos. And this is one of the problem that is faced by wrapped bitcoin. So we actually need some kind of new technology that we can use to use these non smart contract tokens in a decentralized way, in a secure way in our web three world to provide decentralization. Such non smart contract token, like bitcoin, like XRP, you need a decentralized way and secure way to use these kind of tokens in the DeFi protocol, in the DeFi system to provide more decentralization and security.
01:59:51.090 - 01:59:51.512, Speaker A: Right?
01:59:51.586 - 02:00:34.328, Speaker C: So yeah, this is one of the case that I wanted to talk about. Now I guess let's move on to our next topic. That is the next topic that is, I guess algorithmic stablecoin and non collateralization stable coins. And what happened with that? But before moving ahead, if you are liking this video, if you are, you know, this crash course is helping you, then know, subscribe to the channel and share it on LinkedIn and Twitter. I will be really happy. And please like the video and comment in the comment section if you have any doubt as well, just comment in the comment section. And yeah, now let's move on to our next topic.
02:00:34.328 - 02:01:22.472, Speaker C: So now let's talk about our last category. That is algorithmic stablecoin, or also known as non collateralized stable coin. I mean, there is a little different, but yeah, we'll focus more on the algorithmic stable coin part. So, algorithmic stable coins do not use any fiat or cryptocurrency as a collateral. That's why they are also called non collateralized stable coins. So instead, their price stability results from the use of specialized algorithms and smart contracts that manages the supply of tokens in the circulation. So an algorithm is stable coin system will actually, how it will work is that it will reduce the number of tokens in circulating circulation.
02:01:22.472 - 02:01:54.532, Speaker C: When the market price falls below the price of the fiat currency, it actually tracks, right, maybe us dollar, maybe euros. And alternatively, if the price of the token exceeds the price of the fiat currency, it tracks the new token enter into circulation to adjust the stable coin's value downward. Okay, so you'll understand more about it when we take a particular stable coin. So every stable coin, algorithmic stablecoin works on their own tech.
02:01:54.586 - 02:01:56.248, Speaker B: They have their separate tech.
02:01:56.414 - 02:02:40.100, Speaker C: So we are going to discuss some stable coins tech as well. So one of the famous stablecoin that fall apart, actually that fall apart, that one was terra Luna. So we will discuss how terra Luna fall apart, how actually Terra Luna worked. And then what wrong happened with terra Luna? Why it fall like 98% in a single day in a single night, right? And then there was also titan. We are not going to talk about Titan, but yeah, if you want, you can definitely go and look into it. I just wanted to tell you guys, there are different types of algorithmic stable coins. There has been a history with algorithmic stable coins.
02:02:40.100 - 02:03:25.044, Speaker C: As of now, they have never worked as compared to other stable coins. Algorithmic stable coins still yet to prove their power and their potential, right? So as of now, they have never worked. But yeah, let's see, there is a future. We will also look into some statements from know Cz. I have gathered some of the statements from them. So yeah, let's see what now, you know, for this particular crash course, we will go through Terra, terra Luna, what? Terra Luna is how it was actually working. And then white crest to crest and by 98% in a single night.
02:03:25.082 - 02:03:25.428, Speaker A: Right?
02:03:25.514 - 02:04:08.716, Speaker C: So let's go and understand what is Terra Luna and how that worked. Okay, so Terra Luna, what was first of all, terra Luna. So Terra was actually a blockchain itself, right? So there were other stable coins. They were on mostly on an ERC 20 token on Ethereum or they were not blockchains, right? So this whole ecosystem, like the whole stablecoin Ecosystem, actually had an old blockchain. So terra was a layer one blockchain, right? And in the terra ecosystem, there were two tokens. One was UST, that was the stablecoin. That was a dollar.
02:04:08.716 - 02:04:14.432, Speaker C: One that was equals to $1. That was packed with $1. And the other one was Luna.
02:04:14.496 - 02:04:14.772, Speaker A: Right?
02:04:14.826 - 02:04:36.564, Speaker C: So what these two coins were. So Luna was the native token token in the sense, just like we have Eth for Ethereum, right? That is Luna for terra, right? So Luna was actually the native token and UST was the stable coin. So Luna used to maintain the stable.
02:04:36.612 - 02:04:38.212, Speaker B: Value of the terra, right?
02:04:38.286 - 02:05:26.440, Speaker C: It was actually the one that used to maintain the stable value of the terra. That is the UST. So when the value of the UST, the value of USD is mismatched or say deep than a dollar, right, then maybe Ust obviously it should be supposed to equal to a dollar. So if there is a case, then USD is mismatched or say deep with not equals to a dollar, then Luna actually used to incentivize people by burning or by creating more of it. Okay, here you can see the example. Let's go to another slide and understand how they used to incentivize the people. And how this whole ecosystem was used to work.
02:05:26.510 - 02:05:27.176, Speaker A: Right?
02:05:27.358 - 02:05:55.764, Speaker C: So let's see how this whole Luna and USD thing used to work. And this was all like, all the system was just simply based on supply and demand. So if the price of USt the stable coin is more than a dollar, suppose it should be $1, but it goes more than $1. Then what do we usually use? Basically, if there is something that is higher of price, we make more out of the things and the price goes down.
02:05:55.802 - 02:05:55.956, Speaker A: Right.
02:05:55.978 - 02:06:40.508, Speaker C: So simply, if the value of USD is more than a dollar, then you just mint more Luna, you just mint more Luna and burn the USD. And this will make profit for the Luna holders. And eventually the price will get back to $1. And again, if the case is opposite, the USD is less than a dollar, then burn the Luna and mint more USD. So making profit either both ways. So every way the ecosystem is promising to the people to make profit, who participate in this ecosystem and helped maintaining the proper balance equilibrium of Luna and USD.
02:06:40.604 - 02:06:41.008, Speaker A: Right?
02:06:41.094 - 02:07:17.390, Speaker C: So this is simple working of USD, how it used to work. And you see it was not properly backed by something. It was just a Luna token out there. And it was not backed by Luna. So it was just like Luna was helping to incentivize people, but USD was not backed by Luna. Okay, so now what happened? It was all going good, but something happened, like what happened? Whether there was an attack or it was not attack, but let's see what happened, how it actually started. Okay, so there are a few things to keep in mind.
02:07:17.390 - 02:07:49.172, Speaker C: First of all, the founder of the Luna and Terra Luna was Duquan. And they also founded, like Terra. Terra also founded an LFG. Not our LFG, that is. Let's fucking go. Feb three one no Luna foundation group. So they had LFG that used to help to incentivize people and used to take care of the terra ecosystem.
02:07:49.172 - 02:08:41.112, Speaker C: And Duke Wan actually was computer science graduate from Stanford. Okay, and then there was one platform, the other thing was that there was one platform named Anchor. It was actually giving 20% APY. And news was that the LFG, the Lunar foundation group was actually paying people for paying this 20% ap five from their marketing fund. And yeah, that's why there was also news that most of that money, most of the USD, was actually in this protocol. And people were actually minting USD or buying USD just to go through this anchor protocol and just get this 20% APY return.
02:08:41.166 - 02:08:41.384, Speaker A: Right?
02:08:41.422 - 02:09:20.852, Speaker C: So most of the money was there and it was maybe, or maybe not. It was a marketing tactic by Luna Terra guys to get more of UST out there. And this 20% APY is a big caution. And even if you are someone who is into DFI or bank ecosystem, suppose you're getting what, a 5% interest per year in your bank. And then if the other bank is maybe giving 6%, then it's legitimate. Like maybe they're doing the competition. But if it's 20%, it's like ten more percent, then it's a lot.
02:09:20.906 - 02:09:21.172, Speaker A: Right?
02:09:21.226 - 02:09:40.732, Speaker C: So you should always take care of things and do your own research. And crypto, we always say dyor, that is, do your own research and see what is happening behind under the protocol, legitimate or not, because nobody's going to give you free money.
02:09:40.786 - 02:09:41.052, Speaker A: Right.
02:09:41.106 - 02:09:44.060, Speaker C: So yeah, just make sure that you are doing your own research.
02:09:44.130 - 02:09:45.196, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
02:09:45.218 - 02:09:45.756, Speaker B: So moving on.
02:09:45.778 - 02:10:06.272, Speaker C: So they also did one more thing. So Luna foundation group actually bought $3.5 billion of bitcoin as a backup back to USD. Maybe they were aware of this one thing called the spiral loop. Right, the debt spiral, basically.
02:10:06.406 - 02:10:07.744, Speaker B: We'll talk about in the next slides.
02:10:07.792 - 02:10:08.004, Speaker A: Right.
02:10:08.042 - 02:10:27.176, Speaker C: So what is it? So they were aware of it, and this was one of the well known things that people were also aware of. They were also aware of that this can happen. So they actually bought 3.5 billion worth of bitcoin as a backup, so in case anything happened.
02:10:27.278 - 02:10:27.592, Speaker A: Right.
02:10:27.646 - 02:10:44.352, Speaker C: So we had bitcoin. And that's why when the Luna fall, they sell their bitcoin at a lower price. And that's why the price of whole bitcoin was the bitcoin was factored and eventually the whole crypto ecosystem, all the tokens were affected. The market was down.
02:10:44.406 - 02:10:45.056, Speaker A: Okay.
02:10:45.238 - 02:11:35.756, Speaker C: And okwan, I guess today only I read the news that he might get 40 years jail and he was illegally claimed for securities fraud, commodities fraud, and wire fraud and conspiracy. Right? Yeah. He was a computer science graduate from Stanford. So just one thing to always remember is that education and intelligence has nothing to do with honesty and being a nice human being. I've seen several selfish folks who did worst of the things. I mean, just to make money, they do worst things. And we call them as educated morons.
02:11:35.756 - 02:11:46.500, Speaker C: I call them as educated morons. So never ever mix someone with intelligent and good education to being a nice person or a good person.
02:11:46.570 - 02:11:46.804, Speaker A: Right?
02:11:46.842 - 02:12:27.824, Speaker C: So yeah, let's move on. To our cryptocurrency course. Okay, so a lot of people say that this was actually an attack. I mean, someone initiated this death spiral. Now what is this death spiral? So as we've talked about how this Luna and USD used to work, I mean, if the USD goes down, you just mint more Luna. And then if the other thing all around happens, like if the USD goes up, the other thing happens, right? We've talked about it. So suppose, for example, if the USD price goes down, then the lunar supply goes up, right.
02:12:27.824 - 02:12:49.064, Speaker C: So if the USD price is going down, then there will be definitely more Luna will be supplied or more Luna will be minted, right. And if the lunar supplies goes up, the price of Luna goes down. Like simple things, right. If something is printed more, if there is more of something, then the price of that thing is going to go down.
02:12:49.102 - 02:12:49.304, Speaker A: Right.
02:12:49.342 - 02:13:30.420, Speaker C: So this is basically a problem, right. So if the USD price is going down, there will be more Luna printed. There will be more Luna minted if the east price goes down, more Luna printed, and then Luna is eventually going to lose its value, right. This is a death spiral that is initiated, right. So what the attacker has to do is that they have to keep the price of USD less than a dollar. Now, the problem is that if the USD stays down, the more Luna is going to print, right. More Luna is going to mint it.
02:13:30.420 - 02:13:49.176, Speaker C: And the Luna goes down and down and down until it becomes worthless. So the attack had to just the attacker, whoever sold the attacker, they had to do only one thing, is that they had to keep the amount, keep the value of USD less than a dollar.
02:13:49.208 - 02:13:49.356, Speaker A: Right.
02:13:49.378 - 02:14:07.984, Speaker C: So if they do do it, then there will be more Luna printed and printed until and unless the price of the USD doesn't go as such, as much as $1, the more Luna will be printed. And the more when, the more Luna will be printed, the price of Luna is going to go down.
02:14:08.022 - 02:14:08.272, Speaker A: Right.
02:14:08.326 - 02:14:24.032, Speaker C: So that's a problem. So what they just had to do was they have to just make sure that the price of USD is down. And then eventually the Luna is going to get more and more minted and the Luna price is going to go down and down and down until it crashes.
02:14:24.096 - 02:14:24.468, Speaker A: Right.
02:14:24.554 - 02:14:31.396, Speaker C: That's why the Luna crashed so hard. Right. That's why it crashed so hard. We will see the graphs.
02:14:31.428 - 02:14:31.624, Speaker A: Right.
02:14:31.662 - 02:15:01.760, Speaker C: So that's when one thing that the LFG community that do Kwan tried, they tried selling bitcoin. All the bitcoin that they have, like 1.3.5 billion of bitcoin. They had as a backup. They sold those bitcoin, but still they couldn't get it back up. They couldn't get it back up, the UST to one dollars, right. That was a problem.
02:15:01.760 - 02:15:26.804, Speaker C: And then eventually they had to sell bitcoin for loss and then that's why they put all the bitcoin. And then it actually crashed inside the market. Right, so that's why the whole market was actually affected due to the crash of Luna. Right, Luna and USD.
02:15:26.852 - 02:15:27.064, Speaker A: Right.
02:15:27.102 - 02:15:35.996, Speaker C: So this was one of the things that happened, and this is actually how this thing happened. Like how the terra and Luna fall.
02:15:36.098 - 02:15:36.750, Speaker A: Right.
02:15:37.280 - 02:15:57.348, Speaker C: So now let's move on to one few things that happened after the, I mean, what actually also happened, like a lot of people lost their life savings because terra Luna cryptocurrency collapsed like 98% overnight, right?
02:15:57.434 - 02:15:58.310, Speaker B: And then.
02:16:00.360 - 02:16:12.792, Speaker C: There was also a news that one people did side, and not only a single people, there was also news that multiple people sided before, after this event.
02:16:12.846 - 02:16:13.112, Speaker B: Why?
02:16:13.166 - 02:16:55.510, Speaker C: Because a lot of people were involved in this 20% APY. I mean, just this playing marketing tactics, people invested with their trust that they will get 20% APY. So a lot of people actually invested in it. And then eventually overnight it fell by 98% and a lot of people lost all their money, all their life savings, and eventually they had no option to commit suicide rate. So it was a terrible incident and it actually shock up the whole crypto market, the whole web three market. So, yeah, I mean, that was a terrible thing. And algorithmic stablecoin is yet to prove themselves.
02:16:55.510 - 02:16:58.584, Speaker C: But you can also actually go through.
02:16:58.622 - 02:17:01.156, Speaker B: The other algorithmic stable coins.
02:17:01.188 - 02:17:37.136, Speaker C: We're definitely going to talk about more of them. I will show you a blog that you can go through. There are definitely there algorithmic stable coins, there will be new tech, there will be something new that can actually go and we would be able to use algorithmic stable coins properly. But yeah. Now let's move on to our next thing that is. So I got this, after this incident, I got this few tweets screenshot and this news screenshot from famous people. So Vitali actually said it on Twitter as know.
02:17:37.136 - 02:17:43.856, Speaker C: I agree hard on this. Like, there was something called, someone called sassan eth maxi, you can check his crypto.
02:17:43.968 - 02:17:45.924, Speaker B: One of the best guy ever.
02:17:46.122 - 02:18:15.104, Speaker C: I'm following. So agree hard on this. This one is the quibble that algo stable algorithm stable coins has become a propaganda term, serving to legitimize uncollateralized stables by putting them in the same bucket as collateralized stables. What he's trying to say is that algo stable coins that are uncollateralized are being, putting, being someone people are trying to even say, like people used to say that Dai is also a kind.
02:18:15.142 - 02:18:17.356, Speaker B: Of algorithmic stable coin.
02:18:17.388 - 02:18:19.916, Speaker C: But no, Dai is not algorithmic stable coin.
02:18:19.948 - 02:18:20.144, Speaker A: Right?
02:18:20.182 - 02:19:10.492, Speaker C: So people are trying to put Dai rye and other coins that are actually legitimate and that are actually collateralized with algorithmic stable coin. And we need to emphasize that these two things are definitely very different. Okay, yeah, I have already told you guys this, but yeah, cool. Now let's move on to the next thing, is that after this, I also found out one of the big thing from CZ, like not all algorithmic stable coins will be terra like. As he said, he's really optimistic about algorithmic stable coins. Algorithmic stable coins are higher risk definitely than asset peg stable coins, yes, but that doesn't mean they will never work. So CZ is actually optimistic about algorithmic stable coins.
02:19:10.492 - 02:19:23.540, Speaker C: And let's see what I will provide you the link to this doc, so you can actually have a look into what he is trying to say and what is the future. I just don't want to go one sided and tell you only a single.
02:19:23.610 - 02:19:26.184, Speaker B: Story that hey, algorithmic HTML coin never.
02:19:26.222 - 02:20:05.904, Speaker C: Works, but people are optimistic about it and this might work in the future. Okay, so I guess this was all for our four types of stable coins. Now, actually, I forgot that we have to also look into the code of terra Luna. I couldn't find much, but I was successfully able to go through their git repository and found something that might be useful to you. I don't know, let's see. Okay.
02:20:06.022 - 02:20:07.664, Speaker B: I don't know if you are okay.
02:20:07.702 - 02:20:15.696, Speaker C: I hope you're able to see it. Okay, so I went through their GitHub documentation like Terra Money GitHub.
02:20:15.728 - 02:20:17.056, Speaker B: So you can also go through that.
02:20:17.178 - 02:20:46.560, Speaker C: As I said, that Terra was actually a layer one blockchain. So you can see the whole code of the blockchain that was written. Like mostly it is in Golang as well. Ethereum's geth is also in Golang, and then Polygon's PoS chain was also a foc of get. So it is also Golang. Most of the blockchains are in Golang. Yeah, so you can see this was the full node software implementation of terra blockchain.
02:20:46.560 - 02:21:14.196, Speaker C: Smart contracts were also in rest. So I'm not a big rust fan. I don't know much rest, so I couldn't figure out much of these things. But yeah, if you are a rust fan, you can definitely check out their code and you can go through their smart contracts as well. There was a smart contracts links as well. I will provide it in the description. One thing that I found interesting was terra rebels.
02:21:14.196 - 02:21:39.404, Speaker C: I don't know, there was something called Terra rebels and they have this postmortem of USD and attack. They have all the timeline of what actually happened. So following postmortem outlines the key events leading to the deeping of the USD. So you can check that. And there was actually date what happened. A Twitter account named Freddie Reynolds outlined a way to attack the existing models of the EST with capital of 1 billion.
02:21:39.532 - 02:21:39.872, Speaker A: Right.
02:21:39.926 - 02:22:12.190, Speaker C: You can see the reference links as well. So definitely it talks more about what we have talked, but we just talked about overview of what happened. But this timeline is actually good, right? They talked about how all the things happened, how actually the attack was made place. So this could actually become a good movie. So if someone is trying to create good content, they can actually follow these timelines and create a good content or good movie. Okay.
02:22:12.560 - 02:22:12.972, Speaker B: Yeah.
02:22:13.026 - 02:22:20.732, Speaker C: So there was some lesson learned. Don't do fractional reserve banking with 100% debt to asset ratio and unlimited supply cap.
02:22:20.786 - 02:22:21.100, Speaker A: Definitely.
02:22:21.170 - 02:22:24.384, Speaker C: If you don't know where the yield is coming from, it's probably you.
02:22:24.422 - 02:22:24.720, Speaker A: Right?
02:22:24.790 - 02:22:58.972, Speaker C: So as we used to say, in web two, if you're getting something for free, then probably you are the product. And in web three, if you don't know where the yield is coming from, then it's probably you. Okay, so yeah, there are things that you need to take care of. Yeah, I guess that's all of about the terra Luna case. Now let's move on to our next topic. That is. Yeah, there was one thing as stablecoin trilema as well.
02:22:58.972 - 02:23:13.388, Speaker C: I don't know, I mean, whether it is true or not, but a lot of people say that it's true, just like blockchain trilemma, decentralized scalability. And what was the other thing? Decentralized scalability and security.
02:23:13.554 - 02:23:14.270, Speaker A: Right.
02:23:14.720 - 02:23:53.596, Speaker C: We have stable coin trilema, peg stability, capital efficiency and decentralization. You can only choose two of them. So if you are peg stable, then decentralized, then there is a problem with capital efficiency, and then if you are decentralized and caption efficiency, the problem with the peg stability algorithmic one. And then if you are centralized, like then peg stability, and you're missing decentralization, and then overcollectualization, you are missing capital efficiency. So I'm looking forward to if there is any stable coin that has actually solved this stablecoin trilemma if there is, and if you know any, just let.
02:23:53.618 - 02:23:54.876, Speaker B: Me know in the comment section if.
02:23:54.898 - 02:24:17.024, Speaker C: You found any, post it on Twitter and LinkedIn. And do tag me. Okay, cool. Now let's move on to some bonuses stuff. Okay, so I guess most of our course is completed now. I guess we have talked about all those four types of stable coins. And under the stable coin, we have talked about a single, single stable coin, how that actually worked.
02:24:17.024 - 02:24:18.356, Speaker C: We have gone through the code as.
02:24:18.378 - 02:24:20.228, Speaker B: Well, a little bit code as well.
02:24:20.314 - 02:24:24.036, Speaker C: So yeah, this is no more of bonus stuff like what I see is.
02:24:24.058 - 02:24:24.790, Speaker B: The future.
02:24:27.020 - 02:24:28.392, Speaker C: And what are some things.
02:24:28.446 - 02:24:29.768, Speaker B: That are going on right now in.
02:24:29.774 - 02:24:31.816, Speaker C: The market as I'm creating this video.
02:24:31.918 - 02:24:32.570, Speaker B: Right.
02:24:34.860 - 02:24:56.044, Speaker C: As we move ahead, the DeFi protocols are actually in the process of. Mostly all the Defi holder protocols are in the process of developing their own native stable coins to attract users and increase the activity at a time when the crypto trading and lending is flagging.
02:24:56.092 - 02:24:56.496, Speaker B: Right.
02:24:56.598 - 02:25:04.476, Speaker C: So Curve finance actually announced their own stable coin.
02:25:04.668 - 02:25:06.412, Speaker B: They have announced their own stable coin.
02:25:06.476 - 02:25:44.780, Speaker C: Called as Curve USD and curve finance. Algo, stable coins is like, I guess $22 million minted since it was launched. And it was launched recently only like on my fourth, as you can see the date here. And definitely refi protocols are now looking into creating their own native stable coins to attract the users. I found this Twitter thread that was actually amazing and explained the terra like the curve USD very well. So yeah, I don't know who this guy is. Marcus Ledger.
02:25:44.780 - 02:26:34.956, Speaker C: Maybe you should follow him. He has very less subscriber, less followers. Cool. Okay, so if you are a fan of curve finance and stable coins, you need to know about it. If it is a game changing decentralized stable coin that leverages the curve's unique LLMA algorithm, it is also a huge opportunity for vcrve and CFX holders to earn more fees and rewards. What is the Curve USD? Curve USD is a collateralized debt position, stablecoin, which means you can deposit collateral eth and borrow curve USD against it, right? So it is more like what we talked about how DAI works, right? You put some collateralization, you have some collateral ratio, and then you mint the dAi to curve. So it is designed to impact to the US dollar and to have low slippage when swapping with the other stable coins on curve.
02:26:34.956 - 02:26:49.888, Speaker C: And how does curvy SD work? Curve uses curse lending, liquidating Amm algorithm, automated market maker algorithm, which is a noble way of managing liquidations and maintaining the peg.
02:26:49.984 - 02:26:50.580, Speaker A: Okay.
02:26:50.730 - 02:27:14.632, Speaker C: And then yeah, this talks more about in the detail how it works. And firstly, there are also some important use cases for curve. How that will actually why it is important to the curve protocol as well and why it is important for the DeFi ecosystem as well. Because it's provide new options for stablecoins users who want to have decentralized and capital efficient stable coins.
02:27:14.696 - 02:27:15.212, Speaker A: Definitely.
02:27:15.346 - 02:27:55.444, Speaker C: And also leverages curse LLMA algorithm which reduces the risk of liquidation, improves the stability of peg. Yeah, so there are definitely many benefits and every benefits have some kind of backside as well. They haven't talked about it, but I hope so. There are some and people are talking about it. So I guess it's up to you. If you are interested in exploring more about stablecoin curve USD, then you should definitely check it out right now. Let's move forward to our next bonus stuff that is Aave.
02:27:55.444 - 02:28:27.392, Speaker C: Okay, so Aave, I hope you have heard of Aave is one of the most famous protocol out there. Okay, so Aave also deployed their own native stablecoin. As I was saying, defi protocols is moving towards getting their own stablecoin, building their own stablecoin. So Aave also recently also deployed their native stablecoin called Gho on the Ethereum testnet. It's not mainnet yet as I'm creating this video, but that will be soon mainnet as well. When you're watching this video, it is mainnet.
02:28:27.456 - 02:28:28.500, Speaker B: Do and do your research.
02:28:28.570 - 02:28:47.524, Speaker C: Okay, so they have already deployed their native stable coin on Ethereum testnet and yeah, they will also be soon going to get on Mainnet. The GH joins an incredible competitive space as rival Defi protocols also issue or are moving to release their own protocol, native stable coins.
02:28:47.572 - 02:28:47.784, Speaker A: Right.
02:28:47.822 - 02:29:15.268, Speaker C: So everyone is on the race and I guess we will see more of Defi protocols issuing their own stable coins in the future. Okay, so yeah, this is more about talking about the future stuff. What could happen, what could not happen. Okay, now let's move on to one of the thing that I wanted to share that was, I guess, the Gho technical paper. So I found this technical paper, I.
02:29:15.274 - 02:29:16.404, Speaker B: Hope you're able to see it.
02:29:16.442 - 02:29:17.028, Speaker A: Yeah.
02:29:17.194 - 02:29:19.364, Speaker C: So I found this technical paper on.
02:29:19.402 - 02:29:19.990, Speaker A: The.
02:29:22.920 - 02:29:34.324, Speaker C: Website Abe's blog forum. So it's a flexible, decentralized stable coin. Gho it is written by Emily Frenchline, Steven Valerie. Steven is I guess the co founder of the Abe.
02:29:34.372 - 02:29:35.064, Speaker A: Okay.
02:29:35.262 - 02:29:43.404, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is the summary. It's a whole introduction to gho technical paper, how gho works intended to maintain a stable value.
02:29:43.602 - 02:29:44.012, Speaker A: Okay.
02:29:44.066 - 02:29:58.352, Speaker C: So impact of any price fluctuation. So underlying collateral during the periods of Gho is, I guess this is also overcollectrized crypto asset, as it says, like decentralized crypto intended to maintain a stable value.
02:29:58.486 - 02:29:58.784, Speaker A: Right.
02:29:58.822 - 02:30:00.770, Speaker C: So it is also more of like.
02:30:02.840 - 02:30:03.812, Speaker B: Working, I guess.
02:30:03.866 - 02:30:52.172, Speaker C: Almost same as Dai. Maybe there is something different, but yeah, this paper describes the fundamental characteristics of Gho. So if you're interested in learning about how this gho thing is, then you should definitely check it out. Okay, so if you're a fan of stable coins, if you're a fan of Ave, I guess, and if you want to understand how this gho is going to work, then you should get through this white paper and you should check it out. I haven't done my research, I just found out this white paper, so I guess I will have to read it first and maybe call someone from Ave to explain it to you guys. But yeah, I guess let's move on to our next topic. I will provide the link to this Ave doc in the description.
02:30:52.172 - 02:31:20.540, Speaker C: It looks really interesting, so you should definitely check it out. Okay, now let's move on to our next bonus topic. That is the conclusion. Okay, so I guess we are almost done with our crash course. But yeah, before this, I would like to share you two things. Let's not just not conclude. The one thing that I wanted to share was this blog.
02:31:20.540 - 02:31:49.172, Speaker C: This blog is from hacker noon. Hacker noon is a shout out to hacker noon. They are a good website, they have good amazing blogs. So this blog is actually talking about different stable coins like Gho. And then we had this curve USD as well. So it actually compares all this stable coins. And this is actually a good blog that you should check out.
02:31:49.172 - 02:32:31.580, Speaker C: And there is also a comparison chart like criteria, algorithmic algorithm like hybrid that can handle multiple chains, deep liquidity pool. There is like advantage disadvantage uses Gho is actually cross chain to operability. And if you share liquidity provision for curve USD B 56 ecosystem expansion. Okay, so yeah, integration with Circle CCTP. You remember we actually talked about circle CCTP. So Gho is actually integrated with circle CCTP and then weaker governments. We have weaker as a governance token for curve USD.
02:32:31.660 - 02:32:32.290, Speaker A: Okay.
02:32:32.980 - 02:32:49.928, Speaker C: And then yeah, there are a lot of things to go through. So I will provide you the link to. I'm definitely going to provide you as much as link as possible so that if you are someone who is deeply interested into this topic, then you should have enough material to go through.
02:32:50.014 - 02:32:50.360, Speaker A: Right?
02:32:50.430 - 02:33:06.232, Speaker C: So you can definitely check out this blog. And the other blog that I wanted to talk about is one of the blog from Vitalik. Okay, so two thought experiments to evaluate automated stable coins.
02:33:06.296 - 02:33:06.572, Speaker A: Right?
02:33:06.626 - 02:34:03.932, Speaker C: So he wrote this blog, I guess after the lunar crash, like the recent lunar crash, which led to tens of billions of dollars of losses, has led to a storm of criticism for algorithmic stable coins as a category, with many considering to be a fundamentally flawed product. The greater level of security and defi financial mechanism, especially that try very hard to optimize or capital efficiency, is highly welcome. Okay, what is an automated stable coins? Okay, so for the purpose of this post, an automated stable coin is a system that has following properties. One is it issues a stable coin which attempts to target a particular price index. Usually the target is one USD, but there are any other options. There is some targeting mechanism that continuously work to push the price towards that index if it weaves away in the either direction. This makes Ethereum and bitcoin not stable coins.
02:34:03.932 - 02:34:55.916, Speaker C: Definitely the target mechanism is completely decentralized and free of protocol level dependencies. Particularly, it must not rely on asset custodians. This makes USDC and USDC definitely not automated stable coins. Yes, and the practice means the targeting mechanism must be some kind of smart contract which manages some reserves of crypto assets and uses those crypto assets to prop up the price if it drops. So rather than using Luna and that kind of ecosystem to incentivize people, maybe there will be some kind of smart contracts to do that kind of stuff. And rather than having some centralized authority behind the stable coin, we should have smart contracts just to make sure it's decentralized.
02:34:56.028 - 02:34:56.400, Speaker B: Right?
02:34:56.470 - 02:35:32.520, Speaker C: And how does Terra works? You can go too deep into the stuff about how Terra worked and then how rye works. If you remember, I gave you the homework of looking into how rye actually works. So rye is actually a good stable coin, just like Dai. There are definitely some differences. So you should check out how rye works and do tag me on Twitter and LinkedIn. After learning how tie works, how Rai works, I would love to read your Twitter thread or your LinkedIn post. Okay, yeah, I mean this is an interesting blog.
02:35:32.520 - 02:36:04.640, Speaker C: You can check it out and if there is any other block, I will definitely share with you. Now let's move on to our last thing. That is the conclusion of this whole crash course on stable coins. So I've tried my best to cover all the things under this crash course, but maybe I have missed something, or maybe I haven't gone in deep.
02:36:04.720 - 02:36:05.670, Speaker B: I don't know.
02:36:06.200 - 02:36:49.316, Speaker C: You are the judge. Just write down in the comment section. I hope you enjoyed this crash course. Now, coming on to the conclusion of the stable coins, I found this great line from Vitalik as mean if you can make a stable coin that can actually survive anything up to and including the US dollar hyperinflation. Recently, when I'm creating this video, there is a lot of hype about us dollar hyperinflation. Balaji, the famous guy talking about lot of how the US dollar is hyperinflated and inflation is coming, the US bank crisis are coming. And if you can say so, there is a huge opportunity as well.
02:36:49.316 - 02:37:20.844, Speaker C: If you can create something that will feel like a lifeline for everyone going through that situation, that will be great. And one more thing is that you can't just overreact on one particular type of asset that is actually bad. So for example, USDC is good. It's definitely a good stable coin. But there are systematic risk when you over reliance on one particular type of asset.
02:37:20.892 - 02:37:21.312, Speaker A: Like if.
02:37:21.366 - 02:38:21.232, Speaker C: Suppose if everyone starts using USDC, does that mean that maybe USDC could turn something into a lot of, it has a lot of political influence or government is trying to get involved in that. Or maybe there will be some controversial hard folks or some good governance, like some kind of bad influence on the governance. So that could happen. So mostly we need more hyperinflation resistant and globally accessible stable coin, right? This is, I guess, the one liner conclusion. We need hyperinflation resistant and globally accessible stablecoin, which can actually survive. If there is any recession, us dollar hyperinflation or whatever out there, it can survive that. And I guess that will be the most awesome stable coin in the market.
02:38:21.232 - 02:38:37.460, Speaker C: And just to conclude again, there are definitely some kind of stable coins that are being created by the government as well. A lot of government is trying to create. And you know, then recently.
02:38:39.480 - 02:38:40.550, Speaker B: France government.
02:38:41.000 - 02:39:03.724, Speaker C: Launched their CBDC and there was terrible things in their smart contracts. And one thing that I really like about blockchain is that you can actually see the things. It's all transparent, right? So like blockchains, okay, so they had some kind of terrible mistakes, they had some kind of terrible functions that people exploited and posted on Twitter.
02:39:03.772 - 02:39:06.080, Speaker B: And that was crazy, right?
02:39:06.150 - 02:39:27.824, Speaker C: So yeah, stable coins is one of the most, I guess, important topic that if you are in the crypto or in the web three industry, you should know about it. It is an integral part of web three and the whole d five ecosystem. I mean, deFi ecosystem definitely can't sustain without stable coins.
02:39:27.872 - 02:39:28.180, Speaker A: Yes.
02:39:28.250 - 02:39:29.344, Speaker C: Making a good statement.
02:39:29.392 - 02:39:29.604, Speaker A: Yeah.
02:39:29.642 - 02:40:02.028, Speaker C: But, yeah, DFI ecosystem can't sustain without stable coins. So yeah, I hope you enjoyed this crash course. I guess I hope you liked this crash course, and I hope you will share it on Twitter and LinkedIn. I'm telling you a lot of time, but I'm not making any money out of it. So I would be grateful to you if you can share this, like, this video comment right now. And now you can comment how you like the video, give me some feedback.
02:40:02.124 - 02:40:02.770, Speaker B: Or.
02:40:04.980 - 02:40:34.220, Speaker C: Just complete the homework. I would be really happy to see if you complete the homework that I did and that I provided in the crash course, and if you can post it on LinkedIn and Twitter and I send you, maybe I will do some kind of giveaway, or maybe I will prize you or you will talk one on one or, yeah, whatever you want. Okay, cool. So thank you so much for watching and stay happy and keep learning and.
02:40:34.370 - 02:40:34.732, Speaker B: Yeah.
02:40:34.786 - 02:40:35.900, Speaker A: Bye bye. Take care.
02:40:35.970 - 02:40:40.012, Speaker C: Let's please stay tuned for another crash course.
02:40:40.066 - 02:40:41.276, Speaker B: If you have any ideas, if you.
02:40:41.298 - 02:40:51.148, Speaker C: Want a specific crash course or a specific video, I'm trying to be consistent more, so please comment in the comment section. What next crash course you want. Okay.
02:40:51.234 - 02:40:51.628, Speaker A: Okay.
02:40:51.714 - 02:40:53.204, Speaker C: Let's not take more of your time.
02:40:53.242 - 02:40:54.452, Speaker A: Bye bye. Take care.
02:40:54.586 - 02:40:55.296, Speaker C: Yeah, bye.
