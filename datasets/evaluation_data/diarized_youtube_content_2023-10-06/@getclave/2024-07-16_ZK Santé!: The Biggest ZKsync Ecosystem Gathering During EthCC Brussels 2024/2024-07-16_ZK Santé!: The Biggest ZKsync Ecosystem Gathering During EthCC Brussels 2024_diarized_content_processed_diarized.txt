00:00:00.240 - 00:00:57.010, Speaker A: Good evening, IFCC. Tonight we celebrate ipsy kissing. Are you ready? Let's go. And, you know, this is such a special night, I gotta say, because I think tonight is the night where we went from us hosting the ecosystem to the ecosystem hosting us. So a big thank you to Klaive Xi Fi and everyone else who made this happen moving forward. We just love seeing this. So thank you so much.
