00:00:00.330 - 00:00:41.302, Speaker A: What we think is the difficulty of building a L2 is getting the users and getting people to bridge into a new L2 is, like, the hardest thing you could do. Like, I mean, I'm sure you guys know it. Like, if you tell me that I need a bridge into some, like, shitty L2, like, I'm just not gonna do it. But I think we have built this app that people enjoy, and people don't think about it as bridging into a L2 where they don't know what they're going to do with it. They think, oh, I'm just depositing into able. But under the hood, they have really bridged their money into this exchange and the chain itself. What's up, everyone?
00:00:41.356 - 00:00:57.242, Speaker B: Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research.

00:00:57.306 - 00:01:27.554, Speaker C: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We have a great episode today lined up with Julian Co. The founder and CEO of Avo, formerly known as Ribbon, which is an app specific l two built using the op stack that focuses on derivatives such as options and perps. Today is January 24, and this episode will be going out shortly. As a reminder, be sure to use code zero xresearch ten at app blockworksresearch.com for 10% off your annual subscription.
00:01:27.554 - 00:01:29.858, Speaker C: So thank you so much for coming on, Julian.
00:01:30.034 - 00:01:35.260, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me. I mean, I listened to the pod here and there, so. Yeah, it's good.
00:01:35.870 - 00:01:45.630, Speaker C: Yeah. For starters, would you mind giving us a quick history of ribbon, the rationale behind the rebrand to Avo, and the motivation behind moving to an op stack l two?
00:01:45.780 - 00:02:26.310, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Maybe I'll start with the first part of how we started Ribbon and why we moved on to Avo. So, yeah, I've been working in crypto for the last few years. I was previously, like, a software engineer at Coinbase, and, yeah, my co founder and I, we are sort of super active in Defi. We are running all these bots, keeper bots, and all these different dexes and so on. And I think we sort of wanted to build something in Defi. And at that point in time, I think one of the narratives which we thought was really interesting was all the yield in defi at that point in time were coming from basically shitcoins.
00:02:26.310 - 00:03:10.694, Speaker A: And back then it was really ridiculous, right? It'd be like yams and sushi and just like food related things. So it just felt kind of ridiculous. And I think there was no sort of sophistication to the types of strategies people are doing. And at the same time, we saw in Asia there was like a rise of these crypto brokers selling these structured products, and which was pretty interesting. I mean, I didn't come from an options trading background, but I understood the appeal of these products. Unfortunately, I think these products were really targeted towards BTC miners. A lot of them had like a minimum 100 BTC subscription.
00:03:10.694 - 00:04:05.254, Speaker A: To use them, you needed to sort of KYC do the whole shebang to sort of invest in these products. So, yeah, we thought, can we sort of bring those types of products into the d five space to fill that void in the yield opportunity, which was not sort of driven by tokens, but driven by sort of something else, which was maybe like some sort of option related yield, some sort of risk that you're selling. That was like the core idea. And it got pretty successful, I think, in 2021. We launched the first product in April, which was some flavor of what these crypto brokers were doing, but more in like a DFI native format. Within the next six to twelve months, it went from zero to 400 mil of TVL. It became like a category in DFI.
00:04:05.254 - 00:04:52.154, Speaker A: A bunch of people copied us and yeah, I think it became like somewhat interesting category for people to look at. But when the bear market hit, I think people immediately pull their funds out from the most risky yield sources. So basically, anything related to some sort of option readers stuff was pretty scary. Anything which had sort of like a directional bias was pretty scary. People sort of retreated from that to just like, what's the safest possible yield on chain? Or I'm just going to withdraw my money out of crypto altogether. So there was a huge deflation in basically defi tvls across the board. But our category was also affected quite a bit.
00:04:52.154 - 00:06:00.350, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think we knew that was coming. We kind of knew that was going to happen and we started thinking about, okay, what is our next second big act? I don't think we can just sit around and wait for the new bull market or wait for people to get risk on again. And the natural extension to what we are working on is sort of building an options exchange. I think the reason for that was because we built these products that sold a ton of options every single week and we just sold them sort of to market makers on the other side. But I mean, these market makers to buy from Meza and trade it on, you know, indirectly, derabit was getting all this trading volume from the flow that we were generating. So we know, why are we sort of helping this other exchange get all this trading volume? What if we sort of vertically integrated the whole business and we had this big source of option flow, and we also had this exchange where these flows could settle on, could trade on. They also have the core idea.
00:06:00.350 - 00:06:51.086, Speaker A: And I think, yeah, we just realized that one of the hardest things about building a crypto exchange, or specifically like a crypto options exchange, is bootstrapping the demand and the supply. I think you can pay market makers to bootstrap the supply, but if there's no demand, it's very difficult to get off the ground. But I think we knew we had one very big customer, which is like our own vaults. So we thought, okay, we could build this exchange today. And we know for sure we have x million of TVL who's going to just keep selling options on our exchange no matter what. So we knew we had secured at least one very big customer, and we thought, let's use that to bootstrap an exchange. We know for sure we have some amount of natural taker flow from these products.
00:06:51.086 - 00:07:32.160, Speaker A: Can we build more products to bring in more flows and eventually sort of build an exchange from there? So, yeah, we launched this product. It's called Avo in the last. It's been sort of eight to nine months now. We started out with just options, and we've been building a lot of other stuff as well. Particularly, I think the perp stuff has really grown a lot in the last quarter. So, yeah, I think our vision now has gone from just an options exchange to being one of the biggest dexes out there. Yeah, I'll sort of pause there for now.
00:07:32.610 - 00:08:30.074, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's great to hear. It's been really exciting, sort of watching the entire evolution of able, and especially the origin story. Nowadays, you see a lot more defi protocols pursuing that sort of vertical integration, especially if they have a sticky user base, whether that's on their protocol or their user base. And I think Avo is really leading the growth there. So Avo is doing really well today as an op stack roll up, you guys are seeing a lot of transaction activity, and obviously that comes with a lot of costs on posting DA to Ethereum, but you guys have been teasing this for a while. You made a big announcement last night that you're going to be moving to Celestia as a DA layer for obvious reasons, such as protocols, sequencer profitability, being able to scale of the protocol, et cetera. And you've been subsidizing all l two gas fees for users this whole time, which is not normally something you see for a roll up, especially when you're paying such high da costs.
00:08:30.074 - 00:08:43.380, Speaker C: So I guess a few questions here. The first one is why Celestia out of all of the DA layers available? And the second one is, is there any plan to eventually start charging users transaction fees to sort of subsidize yourself? A.
00:08:43.750 - 00:09:26.114, Speaker A: So yeah, we announced this last night. I think it's been in the works for a while. We initially felt like the cost was okay until November, December, when basically Ethereum price started going up, Ethereum gas started going up, and our attraction started going up. So it's like a triple whammy and all our costs started multiplying. So I think, yeah, at the peak we were spending close to somewhere between 50 to 100 e a month just on dA. And yeah, that's pretty crazy, right? That's a few mil a year that we are basically burning. It doesn't help users in any way.
00:09:26.114 - 00:10:14.514, Speaker A: I think users don't feel like this helps their user experience. It doesn't help the business or the protocol at all. So it is like a really big. Yeah, we started looking at all the DA sort of solutions out there and I think we just felt like the one which was furthest along with a working main net was Celestia. I would say it was more of like a practical choice compared to some sort of pros and cons between five different things. It was really like what is available today for sure, that we don't want to be like the guinea pig on some brand new DA layer. So we know a few other people have been using it, especially the latest one, Manta network, which was like a pretty big one as well.
00:10:14.514 - 00:10:59.470, Speaker A: So we know that it would be like stress tested in some way. Celeste team has been awesome. They basically helped us work on the integration in conjunction with conduit, which is like our rollout provider. So, yeah, I think on our side it was actually a pretty small lift. Most of the decisions were sort of like. I would say it's a pretty obvious solution because it was like the furthest along in the market and the most mature. If we had to make this choice in six months, maybe it would be a bit different with 4844 and Eigen DA and a few other big ones.
00:10:59.470 - 00:11:09.940, Speaker A: But if we made this choice right now it's pretty clear. And we were bleeding money to paying this DA on Mainet, so we had to make this decision now.
00:11:10.790 - 00:11:30.554, Speaker C: Gotcha. And are there any plans to eventually charge users a small amount of transaction fees? And I can imagine your celestial dating posting costs, your celestial data posting costs are very minimal. They're probably like hundreds or at most thousands today. So are There plans to charge or is just such a small cost that you don't even need to think about that?
00:11:30.672 - 00:12:22.854, Speaker A: It's such a small cost that we don't think we need to charge. And I think the mental overhead for users to think about do I want to do one big trade or two small trades if two small trades cost a bit more and some sort of gas fee is really annoying. So I think we just wanted to make sure users always felt like it was basically free, whether they sent 10,000 orders or one big order. Yeah. So I think we are going to continue to subsidize it. This would basically drive our cost down by a significant margin. So whatever we are earning in trading fees right now massively compensates for our current cost after we move to Celestia.
00:12:22.854 - 00:12:27.980, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think the equation now is pretty clear. We can keep doing this for a long time.
00:12:28.510 - 00:12:33.920, Speaker C: All right, that's great to hear, Rick, I know you had some questions you want to ask on the options front. I'll pass it over to.
00:12:34.930 - 00:13:16.300, Speaker D: For sure, for sure. So one thing I've been thinking about is if you look at Tradfi, options are a huge part of the total market, like even larger than spot. But then when you come to crypto, the same market structure isn't prevalent. Do you feel that that's going to flip to in crypto? So the market structure is similar to tradify. And on top of that, are you kind of more focused on options right now than pervs or do you see them as equal focus areas because of the maybe market potential there is in?
00:13:17.150 - 00:14:01.514, Speaker A: I think, you know, some other smart traders also echo this sentiment. I think Cl has posted a bit about this as well. But if there was like a cycle where crypto options gets big, it could be this one. I think some of the major tailwinds that we have seen is, first, the option volume as a function of total derivatives in crypto has been growing steadily over time. So it hasn't skyrocketed. I think now it's still in the single digit percent, but it has been climbing. The second big one is we feel like, or at least I feel like there's been a significant institutionalization of the space.
00:14:01.514 - 00:14:42.822, Speaker A: So a clear moment that that became real is when the CME OI became bigger than binance OI. I think that's a clear sign that institutions are sort of entering the space, and right now the option market is dominated by institutions. We actually see a lot of crypto options, market makers trading on the CME as well. So not just like a derivative monopoly anymore. I think so, yeah. I think there's some natural reasons why options could take off. I do think it's still yet to be seen whether retail would want to trade this stuff.
00:14:42.822 - 00:15:55.834, Speaker A: I think a lot of people have also just mentioned this, but perps are amazing products. The liquidity is really good, and you can basically make a perp market for anything pretty easily, whereas the option market requires a lot of complexity around the math behind it. So people can make perps on meme coins really easily, but I don't think anyone would be able to create an option market for a meme coin as trivially so. Yeah, I think it's still unclear that the stuff that retail wants to trade would be unavailable if they would need to use options to access that. But I think for sure, on the institutional front, the options volume will grow as just like a percent of what they want to trade. Yeah, I do think there is like a market opportunity, at least for someone to build this sort of retail focus, like Robin Hood of crypto. I think if you're lucky, the gains that you can get from options could be truly massive.
00:15:55.834 - 00:16:31.622, Speaker A: And that's the kind of thing that gets a lot of eyeballs and gets people interested. People want to get that ten x within one day, which is very unlikely in the perp world. So I do think that there is an opportunity for that. I think we just need to figure out what the sort of user experience is going to look like. A few other things like liquidity. We do have actually some ideas of how to break into the retail market, but we are still sort of thinking about it right now. Your second question on whether we are focused on options versus perps.
00:16:31.622 - 00:17:14.242, Speaker A: I think, yeah, we started out doing options. I think it's still like our bread and butter. We feel like we have the best options offering in the whole space. We feel like we have the best liquidity, the biggest open interest, the longest track record of sort of risk management. We seeded the insurance fund with a mill or so to sort of make sure if there are any issues with risk, things don't blow up. So, yeah, we do think it's sort of like the safest and best product for options trading in defi. But right now, I don't think the option market is going parabolic.
00:17:14.242 - 00:18:03.080, Speaker A: So we are not expending all our energy into trying to sort of squeeze water from this stone. If the market sort of suddenly explodes, we want to be there. Like, we want to clearly capitalize on it, but right now, we are still monitoring it. I think our volumes have been growing very slightly. They're not going exponential, but, yeah, I think in the meantime, I think we do see a huge opportunity in a purpose based as well, which the market is here right now, and it's something that we can spend dollars into, we can sort of invest into, and we know it's growing really quickly. So a lot of my personal energy right now is growing our purpose offering. But the market may come back on the option side, and I might spend my focus there again.
00:18:03.080 - 00:18:09.130, Speaker A: But, yeah, at least as of Q four, my number one focus has just been, like, growing the purpose offering.
00:18:10.510 - 00:18:30.574, Speaker D: Okay, that's interesting, because the way I've seen it is, especially on the options side, if you guys could capture, let's say, five or even 10% of derivatives volume, that would be like a huge driver. Do you think that could be possible in the next one to two years, or is the volume too sticky on that platform?
00:18:30.772 - 00:19:28.354, Speaker A: I definitely think it's possible, but my personal belief is the protocol would make a lot more money if we sort of win the perp side compared to winning a small portion of the option site. Just like the sheer amount of volumes are so much bigger on the perp side right now, even if we got our option volume to ten x, where it is right now, I think our perps would still drive a lot of volume and sort of fee dollars. I actually heard this stat from someone who worked at another big centralized exchange, but it was like one of the big three. Their options offering was less than 2% of their total revenue. So even for a major centralized exchange, that's sort of the economics of it. So, yeah, I think that's why we are focused on the purposeig right now.
00:19:28.472 - 00:20:16.130, Speaker C: Gotcha. Talking about sort of liquidity, right? There's a common saying that liquidity begets liquidity, and currently, Avo is one of the most liquid on chain trading platforms for options and perhaps also for prelaunch futures, which I think we'd like to touch on later. And I guess one could argue that that's one of your strongest competitive advantage, right? You don't want to go trade on an exchange that doesn't have liquidity every trade you make moves the market by 5% or for auction moves the iv by whatever percentage. I guess the question here is how defendable do you feel this mode is? And I guess how do you see your competitive advantage against other options exchanges, whether that's like defi tradfi or like CFI?
00:20:16.470 - 00:21:15.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, for sure liquidity begets liquidity, but what we think is actually the most important piece is like the taker flow. Market makers don't care about which venue they're trading on for the most part. As long as the venue doesn't steal their funds or the venue is not going insolvent. What they care about is like, yeah, which venue am I going to get the most flow and hopefully the softest flow? So yeah, I think our focus is just like get as many users as possible on our exchange, either whether that comes from perps or prelaunch or anything else, and try and sort of push them to different types of products that we offer. Teach them. It may be like a longer process, but teaching them about like, okay, now the market is ranging between thirty eight k and forty two k. You're just going to get chopped up if you trade perps, but you can do some interesting strategies around options.
00:21:15.640 - 00:22:25.142, Speaker A: We do think that's actually how we sort of build our mode over time by just having these sticky takers like real humans trading. I think that's the most sticky thing possible on sort of the market maker and liquidity side. If you actually have a lot of real humans coming and trading, these market makers are naturally just going to show up and they're going to compete to win this flow. So I think for all exchanges on day one you need to subsidize and get one side of the supply demand going. But I think over time if the demand doesn't exist, the supply has no reason to exist as well. So yeah, I think our focus has really just been like, let's just get as many traders as possible on the platform and try to convert them to the different products on AvO. I think that would be our competitive advantage over time compared to, I don't know, some funky fee rebate mechanism that makes liquidity makers a bit more efficient.
00:22:25.142 - 00:22:34.910, Speaker A: We don't think that's actually very useful. We can copy that if we need to, but the part that's hard to copy is just like the distribution and getting users.
00:22:35.570 - 00:22:38.910, Speaker C: You don't think a points program is like, I'm kidding.
00:22:39.810 - 00:22:50.930, Speaker A: Yeah, actually wanted to. I have a draft tweet that I've never sent out where it's just like f points, but we've never tweeted it out.
00:22:51.080 - 00:23:18.010, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's becoming a bit overdone these days. You can see CT is getting a bit exhausted of points, I guess. One last quick question on the options front. How has RFQ adoption know? I used to work at a hedge fund. We used to ping telegram chats with various desks about how much they're coding for various option strategies. So I'm curious, has RFQ seen like a healthy amount of adoption or are most people still trading through the central demand order book?
00:23:18.080 - 00:23:33.620, Speaker D: If my understanding is correct, vaults are still settled through RFQ system. Is there an estimate of when they would be exchanged or would be settled within the exchange itself?
00:23:34.150 - 00:24:01.562, Speaker A: So yeah, maybe just for some context we actually built like an RFQ feature within Avo exchange itself. So the vaults do use the RFQ, but it's within the exchange. We don't use like an external RFQ provider and settle somewhere else. Everything is just on the exchange right now. On the vault side of things. Yeah. On the RFQ front we don't see a lot of people naturally using it.
00:24:01.562 - 00:24:51.850, Speaker A: I think it's been very targeted. When a large whale comes in and either they cannot exit because their size is too big for the book or they want to enter, they don't want to keep eating through the auto book. They'll usually ping us and they'll use the RFQ to basically trade with the other market makers. So I would say for now it's still definitely more manual. We don't have a super active network of people creating and automatically responding to RFQs 24/7 yet. But it's mostly used as a way to trade bilateral with someone else without doing it on the auto book. Another interesting use case that we have found is some of these options, if they are super out of the money or super in the money, I don't know.
00:24:51.850 - 00:25:29.394, Speaker A: For example, actually this happened last night. There's this user who when BDC was at 48k, he bought like a 46K BTC put. So I mean he made money on that, right? But now BTC is at 38k. No one's quoting like a 48K put. It's so deep in the money that liquidity for that option is really low. So yeah, within our exchange itself, if you click close position and there's not enough liquidity, it'll automatically send that order through the RFQ. So actually we find that has been the most useful feature of the RFQ.
00:25:29.394 - 00:26:09.300, Speaker A: It's just like if there's no liquidity in the book. We'll basically help to get liquidity for whatever this guy's trying to get out of through the RFQ feature. And this doesn't force the market makers to always show their bids and offers on the book, it's just they only need to respond when people ask for it. And usually these users, if they are so in profit, they don't mind taking a haircut. So it is also profitable for the market maker to do. But yeah, I think that's been the adoption on RFQ side. We actually do have some ideas around.
00:26:09.300 - 00:26:55.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I think all we need really is just getting something like ten trading firms, big options traders, and we just need a small, tiny network of guys like trading with each other all the time. So yeah, I think instead of getting 10,000 users, it actually makes a lot more sense to get like ten really active trading firms, big traders, just like pvping out against each other using our order books or our RFQ. So we are trying to build that up now. Still in the works, but I think that would be like the best way for us to immediately get some significant tick up in trading volume and adoption.
00:26:55.354 - 00:27:15.782, Speaker B: What's up everyone? March is approaching fast and I want to give you another reminder not to miss out on Das London. It is coming, it's right around the corner and it's in March. From the 18th to the 20th, we have three full days of content. This is your chance to bump shoulders with some of the world's top executives and have open dialogue with both attendees and speakers. We're going to be focusing on a range of topics that I'll let Ren discuss for you.
00:27:15.836 - 00:28:00.770, Speaker C: First on the list we have bitcoin, catalyst, the halving and spot ETF. Next we have a view from the buy side from investors on things like strategy, portfolio allocation and more. We also have a topic on rwas, tokenization and stablecoins, which I think we can all agree are going to pay large role in crypto future. We'll also talk about global regulatory frameworks like compliance, best practices and the evolution of global standards that are shaping the global investment landscape. We'll also have someone from an institutional front to talk about infrastructure such as banking and payments, with financial giants like Visa and Morgan, and last on the list, the macro case for digital assets. So don't miss out on this monumental event. Seats are limited, so be sure to register today by hitting the link in the description and using the promo code zero x ten to save 10% on tickets.
00:28:00.770 - 00:28:02.566, Speaker C: See you in London if moving on.
00:28:02.588 - 00:28:48.420, Speaker D: To the perp side then, I think one of the most interesting products you've launched in a while are these pre launch futures, which, correct me if I'm wrong, but seems that the market has really kind of found you through those or that product. And one thing that I think a lot of people are wondering about is how scalable is the product? Because right now, pretty much all of the listings for prelaunch are quite low volume compared to your other products or like your normal perps. So could you explain how the kind of dynamics of prelaunch futures, how they work and then how maybe scalable they are?
00:28:50.490 - 00:29:27.314, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a very interesting topic. I think we just had this idea a few months ago. We were sitting in the office and binance announced that they were doing this, say, launch pool. And we were just joking around like, oh, what if we could just make a market for it today before it comes out on binance? And I mean, people in our office, we are like traders as well. We all have our own guesses on where we think the price is going to be. Just like betting over under with each other. Yeah, we thought, what if we could actually make this a product on the exchange itself? So that was how we started thinking about it.
00:29:27.314 - 00:30:18.318, Speaker A: And how it works really is actually really simple. It's basically like an order book and it doesn't have sort of like an index price. People are just trading something where there is a mark price which starts somewhere and it gradually floats up or down based on whether people are buying or people are selling. So it doesn't jump around. We use this sort of combination of a VWAP and a t wop to basically move the mark price around. But yeah, I think that lets people speculate on this thing and why it actually will convert to reality is because when the token actually launches, we just convert this instrument into a regular perp. So we just input.
00:30:18.318 - 00:30:58.574, Speaker A: Okay, now we know that the spot price is one dollars. On binance, we input the spot price is one dollars, and the funding rate mechanism just kicks in as per usual. And this instrument that people were trading before will end up converging to whatever the spot price is. So that's kind of how it works. I think before the spot price is sort of listed, people are sort of trading this weird thing which no one really knows whether it's accurate or not. I think it only converges to reality when the token actually comes out. So we try and list these prelaunch markets which are not too far out.
00:30:58.574 - 00:31:52.350, Speaker A: I think, for example, layer zero like some other exchanges listed like a layer zero prelaunch, but it's been sort of like teased for so long, no one knows when it's coming out. Like you may be trading this thing that doesn't mean anything for a year before it ever comes out. We don't even know if it'll come out. So yeah, I think our philosophy is just like, let's try and make prelaunch stuff for tokens that we know for sure are coming out and hopefully within a month or so. And that has gotten the most traction. I think we are just lucky as well that there were a lot of interesting token launches in the last month and upcoming this year there are going to be a lot of interesting token launches. So I think, yeah, these prelaunch stuff has really got a lot of attention.
00:31:52.350 - 00:33:03.634, Speaker A: Basically the project, or people who are interested in the project look at the price like a reference for like, okay, how much is my airdrop going to be worth? There are this whole subset of users who are hedging their airdrop, which is also a very interesting use case. We see all these YouTube videos about how to hedge a Jupiter airdrop on Avo. Basically, all these guys, I don't know, maybe they, Sibu built the thing and just had a ton of tokens and they can lock in the price now, which is pretty interesting use case for them. And obviously the last group is just like speculators. When we launched the Jupiter prelaunch product, I think we started the market at like a billion fdv, which was in hindsight way too low. So over the course of the next few weeks, it went from one b to eight b. So if you were just a speculator thinking this was underpriced, you could really just trade it and sell it and get out without even thinking about waiting for the actual token to launch.
00:33:03.634 - 00:33:37.620, Speaker A: So I do think there are a lot of interesting use cases for different types of traders. And yeah, I think it has gotten a lot of new users onto the platform. Even though the volumes are not anywhere close to BDC and ETH per, it actually attracts a lot of people to onboard to Evo for the first time, which is actually what we care about. So we don't really worry about how big these products can get as long as they're sort of still getting a lot of new users onboarded, interested in Avo and so on.
00:33:38.230 - 00:34:11.466, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely think it's something that people have shown like clear demand. And I think another interesting dynamic is that I think the first prelaunch futures markets, perhaps they weren't that efficient at price discovery. But over time, you saw these markets where the prelaunch future market ended up was a lot closer to where the actual token launched at. I think the best example of that was Jito. If I'm not wrong, for the jeto prelaunch future market, the price was pretty damn spot on. Maybe off by $0.20 or so.
00:34:11.568 - 00:34:49.160, Speaker A: Yeah, 10% or 20% off, but very close. Yeah. So I mean, there are these interesting use cases for price discovery. Insiders maybe are trading this, I don't know. So maybe this is like a market for insiders eventually to break the price where they think it's going to be. But yeah, we think markets, this is sort of like free markets at its best. People who have more information will sort of make it as efficient as possible.
00:34:49.160 - 00:35:22.894, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think it's very similar to a prediction market, which is a fun thing to trade as well. So there's a bit of like a sport behind it as well, because I think a lot of people don't trade like massive size on these things. It's more like a fun little thing. Yeah. But we actually did see one very interesting phenomenon that we saw was like a few days before the Celestia token went live, we just saw a huge uptick in open interest. It probably doubled, and it was from just a few wallets.
00:35:22.894 - 00:35:54.880, Speaker A: So I think there was one or two entities who basically tried to get as much size as they could on the Celestia prelaunch market. So I don't know if they held it, but if they held it, they probably got in below $2, which was like an amazing price in hindsight. So, yeah, maybe someone knew something and that's sort of how they wanted to get exposure. Maybe they expected like a day one pop, which never really happened, and yet they just wanted to accumulate as much as they could.
00:35:55.490 - 00:36:26.310, Speaker C: Interesting time to do some on chain soothing to find it. You mentioned that you really want to focus on perps, and I think perps is probably one of the most competitive verticals within defi today. I guess the question there is how does your perps architecture or your perps decks architecture differ from something, say, like DyDX? And how do you plan on continuing to incentivize large traders or even retail traders to change platforms?
00:36:26.730 - 00:37:35.050, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I would say in terms of Ux, our sort of perps offering is pretty similar to DXV three. So all users and traders basically just interface with this API to submit orders. So you get the millisecond latency that you want. I think that really appeals especially to the options market makers, because whenever price moves by, if ETH moves by half a percent, they need to update all their quotes across 400 different strikes at once. So I do think having ten millisecond latency is really important for submitting a lot of orders at once. And yeah, I think we feel like the model is actually pretty practical and it feels pretty good from a user perspective. You don't feel the latency? We sort of hide the metamask.
00:37:35.050 - 00:38:16.426, Speaker A: You don't sign your metamask transaction every single trade. I think it's as close to a centralized exchange experience as you can get. But, yeah, no, I do agree with you that it is one of the most competitive spaces to play in right now. We do think some of our major advantages are, as you said, on the option side and on the pre launch side. So we are spending a lot of effort trying to actually make those as good as possible. I think it's really difficult to compete on BDC and ETH perps. There are like 20 platforms that offer almost exactly the same thing.
00:38:16.426 - 00:39:03.958, Speaker A: We need to sort of create something that appeals in a different way. So we also do have some ideas of how we can combine options and perps in an interesting way. So, for example, there's this whole concept on bybit called protected perps. I don't know if you've seen that, but basically if you enter a perp position, you can click a button and protect yourself by automatically buying a put or something, and they make it really user friendly for you to it. So, yeah, I think there are all these interesting product features that we could do which combine the products in a different way. Yeah, but I think right now the market is still. I completely agree with you, it's super competitive.
00:39:03.958 - 00:40:06.560, Speaker A: I think our focus actually has been just like user acquisition, particularly outside of what we think of as like the crypto Twitter bubble. We do think we don't want to go after the user who's going to jump from protocol to protocol based on what points they're getting. We think that crowd is, even though they may have a lot of clout on crypto Twitter and they may have quite a good amount of capital, we think it's like a very mercenary crowd. So a lot of our growth and marketing efforts have actually been on very different growth strategies, which we think are actually quite effective. So stuff that tier two chinese exchanges do. So a lot of the marketing in non english speaking regions especially, we've been very focused on that. And I think that really shows in our metrics, because two things, we have the largest user count of any decks, like buy a lot.
00:40:06.560 - 00:40:53.120, Speaker A: A lot of these users are small, so they're not like high value big traders, but they trade a few eth perps or they trade a small amount of. On our platform we have a lot of those. And yeah, we have also just seen the geographic segmentation of where our users come from. A lot of them, more than half come from non english speaking regions. So on our website, the three languages which are supported are English, Chinese and Russian. So we do have a lot of cis users and chinese users as well. So that's been like our growth strategy so far.
00:40:53.120 - 00:41:34.630, Speaker A: That's also why we feel like we don't need to play the fee compression game. I think a lot of these users don't really care if they're paying eight basis points or five basis points. It's practically the same thing on the sites that they're trading. Yeah, we think this is just like way more sticky, way more robust of a user group, less competitive than trying to fight for the same 5000 dfI like crypto Twitter users. So yeah, that's been our strategy so far. But surely we'll see at some point we would also need to go after the crypto Twitter people, but we just started in a very different spot.
00:41:34.790 - 00:42:14.680, Speaker D: Yeah, that's super refreshing to see that not everybody is just focused on crypto Twitter people. Maybe continuing on the development front, I know you guys have previously tried to kind of, as you mentioned, vertically integrate and kind of introduce products that are super complementary to each other. And I've seen Abel recently tweet about some big upcoming developments and trying to expand to a broader defi ecosystem. Maybe any possibility for you to drop some alpha here?
00:42:15.370 - 00:43:26.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll be sharing this in the next few weeks, but basically we are going to build an ecosystem as well, and not just be like an app specific chain. I think what we think is the difficulty of building a L2 is getting the users and getting people to bridge into a new L2 is like the hardest thing you could do. I'm sure you guys know it. If you tell me that I need to bridge into some shitty L2, I'm just not going to do it. But I think we have built this app that people enjoy and people don't think about it as bridging into a L2 where they don't know what they're going to do with it. They think, oh, I'm just depositing into able, but under the hood they have really bridged their money into this exchange and the chain as know. I think when Manta did their whole crazy scheme to get a lot of TVL and so on, they had something in the order of 100,000 wallets who bridged over into their chain.
00:43:26.346 - 00:44:05.690, Speaker A: We currently almost have that number. We are like at 60 something thousand user, cumulative users on the exchange. But all these people haven't thought about it as bridging into a L2. They just think about it as like, oh, I used able once. So yeah, I think we are working on basically becoming like a full stack L2 and using this super app that we've built, which is the exchange, and helping users offboard from the exchange into any of the other apps in the ecosystem. That's something we are going to be working on. It's sort of a bit of a longer term plan.
00:44:05.690 - 00:45:07.920, Speaker A: But for now, for sure, the focus is making this exchange as successful as possible because we think once you do that, it'd be a lot easier to basically build stuff around it. Yeah, so that's sort of like what we've been focused on. I'll be sort of sharing more details about the edge that we think we have or what angle we want to play, but that's what we'll be doing this year. And also I think if you looked at our AEUSD announcement a few months ago, we basically designed it. We could have built it in a very simple way, but we took the difficult way of making it composable. So we used some of the D five vault formats, ERC formats that are composable of different DFI apps and so on. And basically this exchange stable coin that we have, ae USD, is usable outside of the exchange as well.
00:45:07.920 - 00:45:46.230, Speaker A: So it was sort of built with that intention in mind. We just haven't done it yet. We just haven't had any use cases outside of the exchange yet. But yeah, I think that would be a big focus for us this year. And yeah, I think one interesting observation that I have had is a lot of these L2, they built the ecosystem, but they don't build any of the apps on it. We think that's why they need to extract maybe some sequence rent or something. That's how they monetize.
00:45:46.230 - 00:46:12.980, Speaker A: But yeah, one interesting idea is what if we own both the L2 and the app on it? And what if we didn't need to extract rent at the chain level? Maybe the sequencer just makes zero money because we think we make enough on the exchange and all apps on the chain can basically get all the consumer surplus back. That's like an idea we're playing with as well.
00:46:13.510 - 00:46:18.600, Speaker D: Yeah, that's super cool. I haven't really heard anybody else talk about this stuff as that.
00:46:19.130 - 00:46:24.840, Speaker A: Yes. So we will be sharing more details, but that's like a little bit of a teaser, I guess.
00:46:25.210 - 00:47:04.610, Speaker D: Yeah, appreciate it. Maybe going to the Avo and ribbon tokens then. So basically, in short, you guys rebranded from ribbon to Avo a few months ago. And now the AVo governance proposal one got approved, which basically means that the native token RMB will be rebranded to AVo by the end of this month. And I was wondering what went into the process of redesigning the token structure. And maybe could you give a short overview of how the token is going to be used once it's rebranded?
00:47:05.130 - 00:47:44.994, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think when we decided to basically go all in on building the APO exchange, we basically had this choice of whether. I think everyone sort of expected us to just make a new token because that's what's rational. I guess you get like, I don't know, it's like the most extractive thing that people can do. It's just like abandon old thing, make a new thing. But I think we felt like we had this community from before. We built up a bunch of goodwill from before. All our investors, we didn't want to screw them over our token holders as well.
00:47:44.994 - 00:48:18.234, Speaker A: So yeah, we decided to just, instead of doing a new token, we still wanted all the benefits of a new token. Like the tension, the fresh chart, sort of like a new story. I think that was a very important thing for us. But we didn't want to basically screw over the old token holders. So we decided let's just do like a one to one token conversion. No inflation, no additional tokens get printed. If you own 1% of RBN, you own 1% of the able tokens as well.
00:48:18.234 - 00:49:46.710, Speaker A: We thought that was really fair, but we still had, as I mentioned, we could still create a lot of excitement around a new thing, a new story, a new narrative and just make it official by having a new ticker and so on. So yeah, that was sort of the story behind it. In terms of tokenomics, I think we have folded all the revenues into. Our plan is to basically fold all the revenues from the vaults and whatever businesses we had a few smaller businesses like the ribbon earn ribbon vault and so on, just like fold all those revenues plus the trading fees into one stream, put that all back into the treasury and use a portion of that for basically beefing our insurance fund. Use a portion of that to pay out what we think of as our company development company expenses. And the remaining, at least in the proposal was going back to this maker style program that may change over the next few months. But I think when we made a proposal that was like the best value creation model out there or value accrual model out there, that was like the meta of the bear market.
00:49:46.710 - 00:49:52.938, Speaker A: Really. So we may need to change it at some point, but yeah, that's been the idea so far.
00:49:53.104 - 00:49:53.770, Speaker C: Cool.
00:49:53.920 - 00:50:18.770, Speaker D: And yeah, how do you basically think about incentivizing then traders? Because I think you mentioned earlier that you haven't really tried doing that before. And now basically the treasury owns, is it 45% of the total supply and around up to 16% I think is kind of saved for possible incentives.
00:50:20.470 - 00:50:20.786, Speaker A: To.
00:50:20.808 - 00:50:23.060, Speaker D: Be distributed in the future.
00:50:23.750 - 00:51:15.262, Speaker A: So I think one lucky thing for us, I guess, is we didn't waste all our tokens on a crazy liquidity mining program last cycle. I think we knew very quickly that we tried doing a bit of liquidity mining and it wasn't like creating an increase in TVL after a certain point. So we kind of just turned the tap off very quickly. So yeah, I mean, I think the Dow has just been sitting on this huge chunk of tokens for a long time, which is great. So it's kind of like a fresh new projects usually allocate something in this ballpark to what the Dow can spend on incentives anyway. So yeah, I think we still have the luxury of spending it. We can still run pretty aggressive growth programs if we wanted to.
00:51:15.262 - 00:51:50.510, Speaker A: And like trader incentives, which we are designing right now. Yeah, I think we still haven't released details about that, but that's something we are very actively working on now. Just like figuring out how we can best use this whole chunk of tokens in the short term. Like getting to become one of the best taxes out there and in the long term building an ecosystem as well. Yeah, I think we are just glad that we didn't blow it all on some dumb liquidity mining program last cycle.
00:51:51.730 - 00:52:42.830, Speaker C: I think it's good. You guys also pretty aggressively cut down on the token emissions through various Dow governance votes. So that's something that I don't think other protocols were as proactive on. Jumping back to. Sort of like the slight alpha that you leaked just now in terms of the ecosystem and what you guys are planning to build there. Given that you guys are a roll up, do you guys ever think about interoperability with other roll ups? Obviously you guys are built using the op stack and optimism has this concept of the optimism super chain. Is that something you guys are actively thinking about, or is it more so? Like we think we are very comfortable growing our own ecosystem on this AVo roll up and we don't feel like we'll ever need to access or be interoperable with all of these other roll ups.
00:52:43.650 - 00:53:42.366, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe. Firstly, I think one major difference or one observation that I've had is a lot of the top perp dexes in the space have all basically branched out to build their own chain. Obviously, DyDx being like the canonical one. Yeah, I like to think about it as like DyDX has abandoned Ethereum, so they used to be built on Ethereum, but for a bunch of reasons they have decided to go on their own chain. And we've seen that same thing on a bunch of newer chains, like hyperliquid, even like the vertex guys. I think they wrote a thread a while back like oh, what if we could be our own parallel EVM layer one or something? But I think we feel like the ETH stack is getting better and better over time. We feel like it is possible to build good products on the EtH stack alone.
00:53:42.366 - 00:54:22.142, Speaker A: We think we want to be like the shining example of that. That you can build one of the biggest dexes out there without having to build your own layer one. Yeah. In terms of interoperability, I think right now the op super chain, I would think is still more of an idea than reality. It's not exactly clear what it means. There's no formal spec of what super chains can do with each other. It's still more just like a coalition of different projects built on op stack and some sort of economic ties between them.
00:54:22.142 - 00:55:23.570, Speaker A: So we are open to the idea of doing it as long as we see that strong benefit to our user base as well. Yeah, and I think there are a bunch of interesting cross roll up technologies which people are building sort of like shared sequences stuff and maybe like shared liquidity stuff that we are looking into. I don't think anyone has really cracked it yet, but I don't think we need to choose between completely owning our own infrastructure and ecosystem, or plugging to some of these newer stuff. I think we can just try both and whatever helps users get a better experience, we'll do so. Yeah, I think we are not really super strict maxis on whether we want to work with other chains or not. I think it's more of a matter of what is practical. If there are ways for us to tap into uniswap liquidity.
00:55:23.570 - 00:56:00.560, Speaker A: We should do that because I think getting uniswap liquidity is way more important in the short run than building our own spot market. It's way easier to just tap into one of the best spot markets out there. So, yeah, I think for stuff like that, we'll probably just do some interesting interrupt, if we can, for other stuff maybe, which we feel are more native to our app and our ecosystem. We can just build in house or within our. No, no, like, clear either or here, I think.
00:56:01.330 - 00:56:46.990, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, that's helpful. Context. One last question I wanted to ask, jumping around a little bit here, is about the liquidation engine, right. I think the market conditions that AVO has operated in has been relatively muted compared to a full on bull market, where we would realistically see a lot more market volatility. So two questions kind of in there. How do you think about the cross margin framework and its performance in increased volatility conditions? And do you mind just giving a quick overview of the liquidation engine, given that for a lot of people, that's still sort of a black box, but that was a major cause of problems for a lot of other defi exchanges or even centralized exchanges.
00:56:47.490 - 00:57:28.646, Speaker A: Yeah. So I agree that the biggest risk for derivative Dexes is sort of the insurance bond liquidation engine, because basically handled wrongly, we think that can create a lot of losses, especially if it's exploitable. Like, I don't know if you guys have seen some of the DYDX stuff in the last month or so, the Wifi market. So we haven't done any crazy new changes to how liquidations are done. I think we kind of model it based on how some of the other major centralized exchanges do it. So it's sort of this multi step process. First, the engine will try and liquidate you in the order books.
00:57:28.646 - 00:58:28.640, Speaker A: If the book is way too wide or there's not enough liquidity in the book, basically that position gets absorbed by the insurance fund. And there's a sort of like, third step that if the insurance fund cannot accept these positions, I don't know, if it hits some sort of limit, there'll be some sort of auto deleveraging event which we haven't sort of had to use yet, because, I mean, the markets, I wouldn't say it's not been like, crazy so far. So, yeah, I don't think we're doing anything crazy. I think some of the main stuff that we've been working on is stuff around risk control compared to actually at the liquidation engine level. So just stuff like Oi caps on different markets, especially the pre launch stuff, which we think is actually quite risky because there's no natural liquidity for this stuff. So we try and cap the markets there. We cap, like, the order sizes and position sizes that accounts can take.
00:58:28.640 - 00:59:10.460, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we have a bunch of internal risk monitoring to see if there are huge spikes in OI and different things. Just trying to quickly see that. Is there any active manipulation of different markets, especially the low liquidity ones? Yeah, we hired a bunch of people from exchanges and trading firms who have done risk related stuff before. So I think it's really important for all exchanges to have a risk team. I think some crazy stat, which I heard. I don't know if it's true, but I don't know. More than half of Derek's employees are, like, risk related people.
00:59:10.460 - 00:59:53.900, Speaker A: Just, like, looking at big positions, making sure they don't wipe out everything else is really important. Yeah, I think we've also just been trying to grow that for now. We have set the position limits pretty conservatively. I think if I'm not wrong, even on ETH and BTC, you can't do more than, like, a few mil position size. So the trader who wants to do 20 mil will never be able to trade on Avo right now. But that's sort of just like an interim measure. While we slowly increase the sizes, as the insurance fund gets bigger and bigger, we feel more comfortable, like, letting users take bigger and bigger positions as well.
00:59:53.900 - 01:00:49.414, Speaker A: So, yeah, there's no clear answer, but I think it's just like an iterative process, and we just need to be careful and not be too aggressive. I think if it blows up once, it's sort of over, so you can't really recover from that. So, yeah, being more on the cautious side, I would say our liquidation engine is actually quite aggressive. So I would say it's slightly safer for the exchange, slightly worse for users right now, but we think it's probably better this way for now. Otherwise it may end up like an FTX scenario. So, yeah, that's sort of where we are in terms of risk and liquidations. We are working on something that FTX used to have, which is what they call, like a liquidation, like backstop provider.
01:00:49.414 - 01:01:03.360, Speaker A: So it's basically like a set of entities who post capital to the exchange and voluntarily take on liquidations as one of the steps in this waterfall process. So we are working on that as well.
01:01:04.370 - 01:01:13.042, Speaker C: All right, that's great to hear that you guys are putting a lot of thought onto the risk kind of things, which I think there's a few exchanges out there which sort of overlook that.
01:01:13.096 - 01:01:25.138, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely very scary, and it's sort of like, as I said, you can't fix your way out of it after it sort of explodes.
01:01:25.314 - 01:01:46.590, Speaker C: Yeah. Got to watch out for the highly profitable trading strategies. Anyway, I think we've managed to cover a lot of ground today, and we really appreciate the insight into sort of everything, how you guys are thinking about future products, the Avo ecosystem, the token rebrand. Is there any final thoughts that you wanted to add or anything that you'd like to emphasize for the listeners?
01:01:47.650 - 01:02:17.750, Speaker A: No, I think you guys had great questions, so we covered a lot. Yeah, I think just stay tuned for more information about how we think about our long term plans. I think that'll be quite exciting. So, yeah, I think we have a lot to look forward to this year. In the first six months, sort of focused on becoming the biggest decks out there. The second sort of half of the year would be focused more on ecosystem.
01:02:18.410 - 01:02:24.538, Speaker C: All right. And for listeners that want to find out more about you or Avo, where can they find you?
01:02:24.704 - 01:02:53.700, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say follow Avo XYZ on Twitter or. Yeah, just follow avo Xyz on Twitter. If you have any issues, just dm the account or go into our discord. In the last sort of few weeks, since our user account has just been exploding, we have just scaled our customer support. We've gotten, like, five different mods on board, so it's way more responsive now than it was, like, a month ago.
01:02:54.310 - 01:03:07.314, Speaker C: All right, that's great to hear. Thank you so much for taking the time to come on this podcast, and this was honestly a great one. Learned a lot, got a lot of insight, and I think the listeners will be really excited about listening to this one, too. It's really good timing.
01:03:07.442 - 01:03:08.614, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks, man.
01:03:08.732 - 01:03:26.890, Speaker C: All right, thanks, Julian. Hey, everyone. Thanks for watching today's Zero X research episode.
