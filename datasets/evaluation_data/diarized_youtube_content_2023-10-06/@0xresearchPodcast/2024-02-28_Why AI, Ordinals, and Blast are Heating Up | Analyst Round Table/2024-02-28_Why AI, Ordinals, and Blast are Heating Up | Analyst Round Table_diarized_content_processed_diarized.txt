00:00:00.170 - 00:00:11.642, Speaker A: I remember when blast first came out. I think probably for a solid 2 hours in our company sack, it was like, what are we doing in this industry? I hate it here, and it's just like, nonstop.
00:00:11.706 - 00:00:18.446, Speaker B: I also want to add there that I wasn't in that boat. I wasn't roasting from the beginning, so don't put me in there, bro.
00:00:18.628 - 00:00:23.360, Speaker A: All right, yeah, don't fade. Break. I think that's a lesson we've learned over the past few months.
00:00:25.370 - 00:00:40.758, Speaker C: It what's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. March is just around the corner, and I wanted to make sure to give you a quick reminder. Do not top tick your prices of your Das London tickets. If you use code zero x ten at checkout, you can lock in a 10% discount on your ticket. Don't miss out on your chance to.
00:00:40.764 - 00:00:41.426, Speaker A: Get ahead of the curve.
00:00:41.458 - 00:00:42.430, Speaker C: I'll see you in London.
00:00:42.530 - 00:00:59.514, Speaker A: Before we get into today's episode, just a quick disclaimer.

00:00:59.642 - 00:01:17.010, Speaker D: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero x Research. Today is Monday, February 26, so this episode will be airing on the 20 eigth Wednesday, and we are joined today by Westy and Brick from the Blockworks research team to discuss the latest market happenings. Ren, do you want to get us started with little news and governance updates?
00:01:17.430 - 00:01:38.598, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. It's been a busy week. I mean, for starters, I can layer, raise a pretty insane round at $100 million. Sorry, not at $100 million. They raised $100 million from one single vc, a 16 z. I feel like that's pretty rare in the crypto space. Normally you get, like, 30 different vcs on the cap table and then maybe like, 20 different other angels.
00:01:38.598 - 00:02:21.130, Speaker A: Whereas eigenve just decided to go food Chad mode and raise 100 million from a 16 z. I mean, on one hand, a 16 z probably has, like, $3 billion left to deploy, and so they just wrote this massive check. On the other hand, part of me thinks, like, what does Eigen layer need so much money for? Given that 80% of the ecosystem growth is going to be attributable to points and the eventual Eigenair token, no one's going to see that $100 million and think that it's going to be used as incentives. But I mean, all in all, a pretty chad move. I think just based off that raise alone, this thing's just going to launch at an incredible or incredibly stupid valuation. Anyone have any thoughts on the raise?
00:02:22.830 - 00:02:35.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm wondering where the money is going. Are they going to build something extra on top of this? Still probably start hiring more people and start building up some new stuff on top of that is my guess.
00:02:36.850 - 00:03:07.830, Speaker E: Yeah, I think they're just going to be the top service provider, like creating different avs. Someone needs to facilitate the creation of these things. I've heard some cool things being built on the cryptography side, but not necessarily on what's going to generate cash flow. And they're really driving this thing. If it doesn't get adoption, that's on them. So I think that's probably what a lot of the money is going for. But yeah, my first reaction to this was like, eigen token, that's going to be the biggest airdrop we've ever seen by a large margin.
00:03:07.830 - 00:03:10.680, Speaker E: And yeah, I'm excited for it.
00:03:11.130 - 00:03:52.680, Speaker D: I was trying to think through what the valuation they raised because I don't believe it was disclosed. Was it? But you got to think it was at least 5 billion considering $100 million was raised. I mean, that'd be what, 2% ownership? I'm doing that math on the fly. But then on top of that we've got avail, which we don't have this written down in our notes, but it just came to me, they just raised 27 million and you see that they're doing things like kind of similar to Polygon's aggregation layer, it sounds like, as well as restaking. I don't know, I didn't look into it too deeply. But nonetheless, I think it's an interesting trend that some of these infrastructure plays like Eigen layer, are starting to vertically integrate and offer other services to provide more value to their services.
00:03:54.090 - 00:04:26.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited for all of the events that they're going to throw of $100 million. Next on the news and the governance updates, we have ordinals and bitcoin. So I think ordinals have been on the tear lately. Node monkeys are trading at, I don't know, 0.3, probably on the higher end of that. And it feels like people are finally picking up on ordinas. They've been sort of quiet, but I think people are finally realizing that there's so much capital in bitcoin, and either people, a, want that capital to become productive, or b they want to flex that capital.
00:04:26.090 - 00:04:59.766, Speaker A: And bitcoin has never really had nfts until now. A case in point is, for example, there's a bitcoin l two called Merlin, which I don't think anybody has any clue what they do, but they've hit, I think it's 2 billion in TvO, which is like pretty crazy. It's like blast levels of crazy. So I think there's probably more of that to come, to be honest. Bitcoin L two season is probably just getting started. As far as another season, it's airdrop season and Parcel announced their token details. They're going to airdrop roughly seven to 8% of the token supply.
00:04:59.766 - 00:05:31.000, Speaker A: That airdrop is going to happen in April and Avo launch a prelaunch futures market with the token currently trading at roughly a 1.7 billion FDB. So for those who are unaware, parcel is sort of a real estate leverage per trading platform. You get a leverage trade real estate markets, whether that's like London, Dallas, New York, La, whatever, but they also have built this really innovative price feed to sort of bring in RWA or real estate prices on chain. I'm going to take a pause there. Does anyone have any thoughts on either of those?
00:05:32.330 - 00:06:19.320, Speaker B: I think this is one of those projects that could do well because it's unique. We haven't seen anything like this before, and then it could be easy to spin up a narrative here. The only thing that I'm thinking about is I haven't used the platform myself, but I'm hearing that the funding rates can get pretty crazy. So if you're trying to hold a position for a long time, then your gain just get eaten away by the funding rate. So that's like one concern I have with the project over the longer term, but in the short term, I wouldn't be surprised if it does really well because it also plays into the kind of the RWA narrative which, well, now it has kind of died down, but wouldn't be surprised if that makes a big comeback at some point this year.
00:06:20.890 - 00:06:58.318, Speaker D: Salana was at like $10. This was like a year plus ago. And I hopped on a call with the parcel team, actually, and they pivoted to this perps platform based on real estate prices, actually, and they were building something different prior. So I'm really glad to see that they made it out alive because it's safe to say morale was kind of low on that call when I chatted with them. But nonetheless, this is a very hyped project on Solana, and I'm excited to see that they made it and survived throughout the bear and kept building. I think one of the interesting tidbits with this product is the data feed. I think there's real use cases for a real time price feed of home prices and real estate prices in major cities.
00:06:58.318 - 00:07:09.160, Speaker D: So I'm excited to see if that provides the token extra utility that maybe entities that wouldn't normally be interested in crypto would be like, okay, now I need to buy this token because I want access to this data.
00:07:09.770 - 00:07:41.070, Speaker A: All right, thanks, Sam. Yeah. In other news, we have merchant mode, which is sort of trader Joe's other decks on mantle network. They're proposing to give me back as most staking rewards is kind of on the back of the uni proposal that we'll talk a little bit about later. In other news, Athena is currently 5.6% of perps oi on Ethereum. And they also say that they would send a yield from Su SdE to 15% from 44% in order to build out the insurance fund.
00:07:41.070 - 00:08:06.146, Speaker A: And maybe they'll give out these rewards later, maybe they won't. But only time would tell. But then a day after that, they just basically went back on that. Right, because you kind of rugged your stakers of 66% of the yield. Super rough mathematics there. So I think really bad communication. I think boosting up the insurance fund is definitely the right move because at some point this trade unwinds pretty badly.
00:08:06.146 - 00:08:11.020, Speaker A: But, yeah, just horrendous communication. I know some of you guys have thoughts there, so we'd love to hear them.
00:08:13.870 - 00:08:46.450, Speaker B: I just think there's a lot of people who are currently kind of farming the shards on there, and then they might not be planning on staying at the protocol for the long term. And then if they hear that, okay, now my yield is going down. There's some pushback on that front. Other than that, yeah, I agree with you. The main priority right now should be just like creating a good insurance fund. If something bad happens, it might feel pointless right now, but it's there for those situations that you can't kind of predict.
00:08:47.990 - 00:09:58.810, Speaker D: Yeah, I took a deep dive down this rabbit hole last week, and I actually pushed a flash note out for blockworks research subscribers, which, by the way, you can use code zero x research ten for 10% off your sub. But I looked through Chaos Labs's and Athena's internal research, and basically most of the scenarios assumed a $20 million starting insurance fund size and used historical funding data and basis and kind of saw where the fund would accrue. And this includes events like three AC, Tara, Blockfly, Celsius, like everything terrible that happened over the last year, as well as the ETH proof of stake to proof of proof of work to proof of stake trade when everyone was shorting perps and the funding rate got super positive. So basically, though, kind of rambling here at this point, but basically, the research doesn't include any of the other risks outside of funding and basis. So I have a big problem with that. Just because of the fact that there's smart contract risk, there's exchange risk, there's liquidation risk, some of these black swan events that you can't foresee need to be baked into the insurance fund's required sizing, in my opinion. And these studies just didn't do that.
00:09:58.810 - 00:10:39.690, Speaker D: And on top of that, we're sitting at like a $2 million insurance fund right now. They did just raise $14 million, so I think that's going to get up to 10 million. But either way, all of the studies that they conducted assumed a $20 million starting point instead of a $10 million starting point. So all of this to say, I think that they need to be extremely aggressive right now in building up the insurance fund. And unfortunately, the communication, or lack thereof, I should say, is kind of what caused this backlash and made them backstep on going aggressive into building up the insurance fund. So hopefully they'll get that figured out, or at least give the Dow like, control or some governance here early on, so that way these changes can be made and they won't receive backlash for being responsible.
00:10:41.310 - 00:11:17.800, Speaker E: I also think it's wild that they already have 5.6% of all perps OI on ETH, and I'm not sure if this is the case, but I don't believe their back testing included the fact that they're going to have a material impact on these funding rates, especially as they continue to scale up. And so as a result, as they become 10%, 20% of perps Oi and ETH, I think it's going to have an incredible impact on what rates look like across different exchanges, et cetera. And so, yeah, I'm curious to see how that impacts, specifically the protocol and the need for that insurance fund.
00:11:19.850 - 00:11:49.070, Speaker A: Do you guys think that because a lot of people normally look at funding rate and how hot they are as a sign of market froth, do you think those dynamics change with Athena? I mean, probably not so much at 5%, but say like 20%. Everything else may be at like a 50% funding rate, and if may be at a 10% funding rate. Do you guys think that there's like a material impact there. And how should you view the market, or at least Eve's funding rate market from here on out? With Athena.
00:11:52.470 - 00:12:34.320, Speaker E: I feel like the funding rate should, in theory, in a perfectly efficient market, reflect the inherent yields of that specific asset. So for most L1s, it'd be their staking reward rate. And over time, as we see sort of strategies like what Athena is doing, where you have delta neutral strategies, where you're long the asset itself and gaining, staking yield and shorting on a perp, eventually, markets are going to get efficient enough where those are pretty well dampened over time. And so I think you're just going to look at those funding rates and know that they're taking into account some sort of strategy like this.
00:12:35.650 - 00:13:13.706, Speaker A: Yeah. If you want a much deeper dive on Athena, go check out our latest empire episode, where our resident research analyst, Matt gave a fantastic deep dive into sort of everything, Athena, especially the risk. Next on the news and governance updates, we have apecoin voting for arbitram orbit as sort of their own app chain. I think there were a few contenders there. Optimism, Zksync, I think Polygon, CDKSU. But ultimately arbitram orbit won the vote, and they're doing it in partnership with an entity known as Horizon Labs. I'm not sure what the connection is there, but I think this was a pretty big vote, just in terms of Apecoin's name.
00:13:13.706 - 00:13:48.190, Speaker A: Maybe not so big in the app chain will actually become big, but he's just a brand name, and I don't think it means much. I feel like we just got to wait until it's actually built. I wouldn't be too surprised if this thing takes way too long to be built and actually launched. Next on the news and governance updates, we have Gauntlet dropping Ave. This is kind of like a weird one. Basically, Gauntlet has been the risk provider for Aave for a pretty long time. They help manage protocol, risk, interest rates, loan of values for different markets.
00:13:48.190 - 00:14:16.202, Speaker A: And last week, basically, Gauntlet said, all right, guys, we're done here. We're having some problems working with the Dow. Sure. You can probably speculate as to why they caught up that engagement. I think they've had a relatively problematic relationship with a few specific individuals in the Dow. And as Matt on the research team said, right, it's a hard job. You're interfacing with God knows, like 20, 3100 different stakeholders.
00:14:16.202 - 00:14:43.106, Speaker A: All of them are super whiny. All of them want a lot while not wanting to pay a lot. And it's just a hard job. Right. It's a lot of politics involved and probably less so much like actual quantitative analysis. And probably the best example of this is the curve fiasco on Ave, where Mitchell sedone just got blown out of the water. But the whole time, gauntlets were saying, like, guys, you should reduce the risk, you should cap the LTB, you should stop new borrowers.
00:14:43.106 - 00:15:06.800, Speaker A: And then everyone just voted Gauntlet down. And then in retrospect, it was like a pretty stupid thing to do. And so, yeah, that was a pretty hard thing to interface with. And at blockworks research, I think we've seen firsthand how hard dows can be to work with, but also, I think there's a lot that we can improve in that process. And as also, Brockwick's research is here for that. Anyone have anything to add for those?
00:15:08.850 - 00:15:36.630, Speaker D: I think you hit it on the head. I think dows are just tough customers and you kind of get crucified. Like, no matter what you do as a service provider, it's like everything you do is forward facing. And if you step up or misstep just once, that's the only thing you're remembered for. All the other work that you did unfortunately just goes by the wayside, and everyone only recognizes your brand with that one mistake that you made. So I get why Gauntlet is stepping down. It's a 24 7365 job.
00:15:36.630 - 00:15:43.290, Speaker D: So I think they did fantastic work and I wish them nothing but the best. And hopefully Ave can find a solid replacement.
00:15:44.190 - 00:16:06.210, Speaker A: Yeah, strong agree there. All right, next, we have a quick word from osmosis. Thanks to our fantastic sponsor, DYDX. All right, guys, now moving on to our DYDX segment this week, we have Sonny from osmosis. Thank you so much for coming on. So I'm going to dive straight into it. How has osmosis worked with DYDX since the DYDX chain launched in October last year?
00:16:06.280 - 00:16:40.426, Speaker F: Yeah, having DyDX join the cosmos ecosystem has been great. They definitely helped bring in a lot of capital into the ecosystem. Getting Cosmos native USDC. I think half of the Cosmos native USDC is on DYDX at this point, and then, like, 40% of it is on osmosis. So I think the two of us together are making up quite a bit of that usage right now. And, yeah, the team has just been really good. We've been helping them a lot from the technical standpoint with just technical support.
00:16:40.426 - 00:17:55.970, Speaker F: We've been using the Cosmos SDK for four or five years now at this point from osmosis and before and so, yeah, they lean on us for technical support, but then they've really, over the course of the last year or two, just like, massive improvement on their technical side, and they're like some of the best SDK devs out there on the product side. I think the biggest source of interaction today is that they use osmosis stable swaps for swapping between Ethereum native USDC and Cosmos native USDC. So if you're on Ethereum and you want to send USDC to DYDX chain, it sends it to osmosis, swaps it to the cosmos native one, and then passes it on to DYDX. So that's using a project called Squid that sort of enables a lot of that, but with osmosis in the back end. But, yeah, we're exploring other things that we might be able to do in the future, whether it's probably not this year, but DX will eventually support multi collateral systems. And so, for know, hoping we'll be able to work together to use osmosis as the back end for a lot of those liquidations.
00:17:57.590 - 00:18:18.410, Speaker D: Osmosis in particular ended 2023 on a very high note with Q four volume up like 250% or something crazy quarter over quarter. And 2024 has actually started off pretty well as well, with $1 billion or more of volume for three months in a row. So what can you attribute to the rising attention and volume to osmosis?
00:18:19.070 - 00:18:31.246, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it's a combination of new capital entering the ecosystem and a number of new assets that have been much hyped up.
00:18:31.268 - 00:18:31.642, Speaker A: Assets.
00:18:31.706 - 00:19:12.170, Speaker F: So I think the beginning was probably with Celestia. So osmosis is the main decks for TIA, which is obviously a very popular asset these days. And so I think TIA, on a lot of days even has flipped atom in volume on osmosis. So historically, Adam has always been, like, the number one token by volume on with TIA. But then now, last month, we had dimension, and in the coming months, there's just a lot more projects, especially in that whole modular ecosystem, many of which will probably have their decks go to market. Be on osmosis.
00:19:13.310 - 00:19:20.526, Speaker A: Got you. I know osmosis has a lot of stuff on the roadmap for 2024, so we would love to hear a little bit about what you have in mind.
00:19:20.708 - 00:20:03.662, Speaker F: A lot of the focus is on just increasing access to these assets. Right. So both within the cosmos ecosystem and beyond. So a lot of new assets coming in Cosmos, you have barrachain, astria initia, all these projects that people are very excited about, but then we're working with a lot of projects. There is a top ten market cap asset that is activating IBC within the coming months. And so we're working very closely with them to be like their interchain go to market, but then working with different bitcoin bridges. I think bitcoin is a massively undertapped market on the spot deck side.
00:20:03.662 - 00:21:03.390, Speaker F: So how do we bring in bitcoin and have that enter the defi ecosystem? And then finally we're working on a lot of account abstraction stuff. So I know a lot of people are working on account abstraction stuff these days, but I think most people are taking it from a very infrastructure standpoint where they're building infrastructure and expecting apps to integrate with it. Because we have actually a user facing product. We are starting from a very like, okay, what are the specific product features that we want to enable and then building the account abstraction pieces to enable those specific features. So the first one is this thing we have called one click trading, which basically means you can do trades without having to sign every single time. There are other apps that actually have this, including DYDX, so they were actually one of probably the first to do that. But what we're doing is adding a lot more security functionality to it because the way that a lot of people implement this, it's a little bit dangerous.
00:21:03.390 - 00:21:46.880, Speaker F: We're making it so like we're working with a company called Blockade and building all these security functionality to make it so that this one click trading is much safer. And then we're working on a lot of onboarding stuff. Our goal is how do we get to the point that people can onboard into osmosis without needing to install any sort of chrome extension or anything like that? Or we're working on a mobile app as well. But how do you start using the mobile app without needing to copy your private key from one device to another? We're building out a lot of this counter track stack and I hope it'll be used by more cosmos chains. As you know, Zion is one cosmos chain that's planning on using our stack, and I hope DyDx will eventually adopt it as well.
00:21:47.330 - 00:22:01.262, Speaker A: Nice. I love to focus on the user experience. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have for today. But thank you so much for coming on, Sunny. Now moving on to hot seat coupon segment. Thanks, guys. Now moving on to the hot seat coupon segment.
00:22:01.262 - 00:22:05.730, Speaker A: This week I'm going to pass it off to Wesy first. Wesy, who do you have in the hot seat? Or Kuzzone?
00:22:06.070 - 00:23:02.630, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. Definitely want to start us off here with a cool throne, which is uniswap, which finally, I guess enacted. Or there's a proposal to enact the fee switch. So specifically uniswap foundation hit the forums to what they call activate Uniswap protocol governance by basically allowing uni token holders who have delegated and now stake their tokens to receive a portion of protocol fees. They cite the reason for doing this to facilitate better governance participation in the protocol, because right now I think less than 10% of all circulating uni tokens vote on any given proposal, which is really low participation, and they're hoping this kind of mechanism encourages sale uni to be delegated and have that Uni actually be active in voting on proposals. I think this is a pretty obviously good idea. It's been in the works for a while.
00:23:02.630 - 00:24:18.266, Speaker E: Gauntlet has actually done some research in the past simulating the Uniswap fee switch, what that would look like in terms of the impact it would have on liquidity TvL swap volume, because including an additional fee will obviously change the calculations when it comes to traders, when it comes to people providing liquidity, and whether it's worth it for them compared to alternatives. And they also looked at which pools would be most affected by the fee switch. And interestingly, those pools were particularly ones with high competition. So for example, stable swaps were one of those, because you have things like the three pool on curve with a lot of competition for liquidity. So any amount of additional fees will help competitors inch out when it comes to arbitragers or people going through aggregators, et cetera. I did some math myself on what the protocol revenue could look like. So if we assume that governance decides to add the protocol fee switch to the same pools that Uniswap Labs chose, which is just like weath and ETH swaps between stables, as well as stable swaps between unlike stables.
00:24:18.266 - 00:25:06.110, Speaker E: So like euro stables to USDC, et cetera. And if they choose pools like that, if we look at a 5%, 10% or 15% fee switch, it would be 9.4 million, 18.8 million or 28.2 million annual revenue contributed by the fee switch. And if we assume the highest the 15% there, then a 50% stake rate, then staking returns would only be zero point 75% APR for stakers, which is on the lower side for sure, compared to other DFI apps that allow staking. But I also did some calculations looking at like moon math, what the highest potential revenue under the fee switch could be.
00:25:06.110 - 00:26:15.460, Speaker E: So I looked at all pairs that have a fee and could be included in the fee switch, and looked at Uniswap's highest monthly volume, which was December 2021, and a 15% fee switch there would mean 221,000,000 in annual revenue, which would contribute to a 5.3% APR at a 50% stake rate. So it looks much better in sort of bull market territory, and as you add more pools, obviously. But, yeah, it looks like based on the proposal as it's currently written, it looks like the fee switch will be between 10% to 25% because they're going to be using whole number of fractions extracting from the fee in its current state. So this means they're going to start at one 10th, but you can go one 9th, one 8th, one 7th, to one fourth of the fee that they're currently collecting, and that will go to the protocol instead of lps. But, yeah, I'm just excited to see how this plays out with what governance decides to do with respect to which pools are used, how large the fee switch is going to be itself. But, yeah, this is just a long time coming, and I'm glad to see them try it out.
00:26:19.050 - 00:27:38.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, like, mentally, it's kind of interesting, sort of dynamic here. Right? Previously, uni, from a financial perspective, has zero value accrual, so it should be valued as zero, kind of. But you could also argue that before this feesage proposal came out, people were basically pricing in the probability of a feesage proposal, and also pricing in how much revenue that feesage would come in. So I guess with this proposal, basically from like, a mathematics perspective, the probability became much higher. And this time, I think it's like a lot higher chance of passing through, because it was proposed by the Uniswap foundation themselves, rather than some random other entity. And I don't think they would do so without having gone through the correct legal checks and talking to the big delegates or the big token holders, knowing that they had their support. But then, on the other hand, you could also say, if you're holding the uni token in a bull market, or like any token, to be honest, does 1%, 3%, or like a 5% APR really move the needle? I guess at the end of the day, having yield and sort of that financial value is still a lot more valuable than having no financial value.
00:27:38.130 - 00:28:33.198, Speaker A: And the uni token kind of just being a governance token. I like how that they're sort of intertwining, staking and delegation with this sort of, like, fee switch. I think that makes sense. It shouldn't just be a fee switch for every single uni token holder that you can claim, as long as you have the uni token in your wallet. I think having an engaged delegate system and active one that's incentivized in the right way is really important, especially for an ecosystem as large as uni who nowadays I think are thinking a lot more granularly about the strategy, or sort of a lot more intentionally, right? You're seeing them talking about crosschain token incentives. With Unisoft V four and Unisoft X growing, I think those strategy discussions become a lot more important, and Unisoft realizes that it's kind of been lacking a little. It's kind of just been sitting enjoying its market share on mainnet, but not really thinking about its overall strategy on other chains.
00:28:33.198 - 00:29:03.280, Speaker A: Sure, they have their product strategy super toned down, sorry, not toned down, but they've honed in on their product strategy, but not so much like crosschain strategy. And I think all in all, a good move. Obviously a lot of these other defi tokens experience the re rate higher too. But to be honest, a lot of other tokens have a feasitch on already. Or for example, there's another subset that really don't have that much in fees to distribute, but a good move for the industry as a whole.
00:29:05.410 - 00:29:28.920, Speaker D: For either of you guys who actually follow uniswap more closely than I do. What is the bullcase on Uniswap growing fee revenue beyond just simple spot fee? Take guess, is there perps coming down the line? What is supposed to ultimately increase revenue for Uniswap through v four and other things?
00:29:30.250 - 00:30:34.220, Speaker A: If I had to guess, it would be two things. The first is v four and hooks finding some way to internalize MeV into the protocol rather than sort of leaking that value to searchers and builders. I think a whole host of MeV related hooks come online once v four comes on in q three, and at some point unisoft may see a good one and say, hey, this one's really good for our protocol, it's good for our lps too, and we want to internalize this, and that would result in God knows how much in potential free revenue. I think the other sort of X factor is Unisopx, no pun intended. At some point I think Unisoft X becomes like a pretty liquid cross chain bridge, and I'm not sure if they charge a fee on it today, but it wouldn't be too crazy for them to charge a fee on it, especially given the sort of brand stickiness that Unisop has. So I think those are the two main excess methods of value accrual beyond just like the spot product today.
00:30:39.730 - 00:32:10.466, Speaker E: Yeah, they're definitely trying to release new products. It seems like, like Ren said, with Uniswap e four coming up and Uniswap X as well as the Uniswap wallet, it seems like they're just continuously building new products that at some point in time will accrue value to the protocol or to the labs or foundation eT. Yeah, I mean, going back to what Ren said, I agree that this kind of design where they're sort of marrying both delegation and the staking rewards is like a really good one because it does facilitate that governance participation. And also, while I gave some of the numbers for staking rate, even though it'll be pretty small, I think just having staking in general is enough for people to lock up their capital because there's something psychological about the fact that you have an asset and now you have a place to lock it and put it somewhere. That is definitely something people are going to look at and participate in. And I just think this is a good design as is. But yeah, the things I'm particularly interested in is what percentage take rate they choose because it can have a meaningful impact on the protocol itself and whether arbitragers, MeV bots, aggregators swap through Uniswap, because if you go too high, then they'll go to competitors.
00:32:10.466 - 00:32:29.858, Speaker E: And again, I definitely recommend reading the gauntlet report because they go through a few different scenarios and how that'll impact total volume TVL and so, yeah, I'm just interested to see how this changes not only uniswap, but the dynamics between Amms and order flow in general.
00:32:30.024 - 00:32:34.820, Speaker A: All right, next we have brick. Brick, who do you have on the hot seat of Cooltrone this week?
00:32:35.830 - 00:34:13.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I have blast in the Cool throne just because of their kind of growth strategy that they've been implementing. Or actually, I don't know if they should be half and half in both Cooltrone and hot seat, but yeah, they just tweeted that main net is launching on February 29. And yet what I was referring to when saying that they might or maybe should be in the hot seat is because when they first opened deposits, there were quite a lot of debate about how it was done with some kind of shady marketing speech of people becoming pre rich and things like that. And then also a lot of people were bashing the fact that they didn't have a function in chain yet, but especially the latter part, I didn't have a problem with it back then and don't have a problem with it right now. I think that they just executed really well on their kind of bd strategy with gamifying the whole project. And yeah, it helped that they had really big name backers and then, of course, already a proven founder. But the way that you could earn points, you could invite your friends and earn more points, they kind of created this flywheel for gaining capital and then by getting, or you get points by doing these spins, and that also makes it more gamified.
00:34:13.838 - 00:35:40.394, Speaker B: So it's like giving current crypto users what they want to use. And now they've got over 2 billion in TVL. So with that much locked capital, it becomes easier to then attract builders. And they also run this big bang competition which got over 3000 submissions from projects, probably a lot of farmers at that point as well, but I think they chose around 50 projects that they're going to help out with or advertise or whatever it's called. And, yeah, okay, coming back to the hot seat part, I think from time to time they're maybe a bit too aggressive on the advertisement side. So again, they had, I guess, posted about the project called RiskCON Blast through their Twitter page, which a lot of people read as, okay, this has to be a super, well, DD project, and there's no way this is going to rug. And then I think the rumor on the street is right now that around 400 or 500 Eat got collected by the project and now all the socials are deleted and the founders aren't known.
00:35:40.394 - 00:36:27.950, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's one way or easy way to shoot yourself in the foot if you do these advertisement things too aggressively. And yeah, a final part that I want to mention is I've been looking at blast the NFT exchange quite a lot recently, and their season three is ending in May of this year. And all of the rewards for this season are coming from blast. So a lot of people think it's going to be the native token, and 50% of all the rewards are going to. Oh, did I said blast the exchange? I meant blur.
00:36:28.610 - 00:36:29.950, Speaker D: We knew what you meant.
00:36:32.390 - 00:37:41.080, Speaker B: Please do some editing work there. But yeah, blur the NFD exchange. And yeah, 50% of all of the rewards are going to blur depositors. But once this season ends, Blur probably has to come up with a new, either implement some kind of a value accrual mechanism for the blur token or then continue funneling some kind of rewards for blur stakers because otherwise there's like from season two, they released like 200 or 300 million blur tokens to the market. And a lot of people back then thought that there would be like huge sell pressure coming from that. But with this deposit taking strategy, they managed to curve that. But yeah, if going forward, nothing exceptional happens or blur doesn't implement a new exchange mechanism or something like that, then I think that token could be in some trouble going forward.
00:37:41.080 - 00:37:44.070, Speaker B: But yeah, that's all I had. Any thoughts?
00:37:46.170 - 00:38:26.500, Speaker A: I think as the space has progressed, obviously gamification has become more and more rampant, and I don't think that's even something that's limited to crypto. I think that's just like a general societal trend, right? Anything that can be gamified will be gamified. Especially, for example, these online live streaming shopping. Online shopping, live streams. Those are probably the most dopamine hitting experiences one can have. Or just like walking into a digital casino. And I think blast did that, right? To be honest, both from a builder and a sort of depositor perspective, right.
00:38:26.500 - 00:38:57.754, Speaker A: I think you will see a lot of l two s or whatever like app chains copy this playbook because it's a chicken and nick problem. You want capital, but the capital wants something to do. So you lock up this capital for a certain period of time, and then you have in blast case 2 billion in Tbl. And then devs get super excited because there's 2 billion tbl, which obviously are in it for an airdrop. They want to go completely djen and go ham for their airdrops. And now you incentivize all of these builders to come to your chain and build. I mean, 3000 projects is pretty insane.
00:38:57.754 - 00:39:44.720, Speaker A: Sure, some of them are probably just scams or like GitHub commits, but still, it's a pretty crazy number. And I think they just played it right so much and it's just going to be a paybook that's going to be copied more and more. Did the yield bearing component help that much? Probably not that much, but I think just mentally is good. Knowing that your asset is being productive and has yield similar to the uni fee switch, it's just a good mental unblock for you to actually have a reason to deposit rather than just thinking, oh sure, I'm getting points, but my capital is just sitting there and not doing anything. And yeah, I don't know whether blast projects are going to airdrop to, for example, everyone that holds e for stable coins in their bridge, but I wouldn't be too surprised, to be honest.
00:39:46.210 - 00:40:33.760, Speaker D: I also think as a part of that big bang competition, the airdrop is half to users and depositors and then half to protocols. So if you were on that list of winning projects and you receive basically a shit ton of the blast token, and you can use that to attract users and get people to try out your products, the execution plan here is so perfect. And as much as we all hated it the day it was announced, and we figured out, all Right, everyone's just depositing billions of dollars into this multi sig. Yes, that was terrible optics, but it worked. And I think we're in the early innings of Blast, and I personally didn't deposit over there, but I'm excited to bridge over there and try some apps out because I do think there's some interesting use cases with native yield bearing stuff.
00:40:35.650 - 00:41:51.938, Speaker E: Yeah, I definitely agree with what you guys have said. I was definitely a blast hater when I first came out, just with the marketing and the fact that the chain wouldn't exist for multiple months. But looking back, I agree with everything that this is actually the correct strategy by, like you said, having native yields itself isn't the biggest game changer, but it definitely attracted enough people to lock $2 billion worth of capital. Like, the fact that it wasn't launched for three months allowed for these deposits and then for them to actually attract good developers to build good products. And so at this point, it's really impossible to fade with $2 billion of automatic deposits as it's going live with many projects that are going to be on the chain as main net hits. I can't imagine how this doesn't do extremely well, but at the same time, you definitely need to be careful with a lot of the new projects, because just as much as the $2 billion in TVL attracts good developers, it also attracts a lot of bad developers and people looking to rug, just like the risk on Blast team, et cetera. So I would be pretty careful with which projects you invest in or buy their token, et cetera.
00:41:51.938 - 00:41:58.550, Speaker E: But I do think it's definitely a place to pay attention to, especially if you're a djen like us and in the weeds.
00:41:59.850 - 00:42:41.000, Speaker A: Yeah, I do have to say that I feel like we fumbled this one a little. I remember when Blast first came out, I think probably for a solid 2 hours in our company stack, it was like, what are we doing in this industry? I hate it here, and it's just like, nonstop. Everyone could not get over the square point systems like the pre rich marketing, and we were just like, I hate it here so much. But, I mean, yeah, in hindsight, now, I think it was, like, a really good move, but at that moment, I was like, dude, what are we doing here? But, I mean, at the end of the day, where crypto is today, the users are like 99.9% just here to speculate and gamble. So you might as well give the users what they want.
00:42:43.930 - 00:42:50.760, Speaker B: I also want to add there that I wasn't in that boat. I wasn't roasting from the beginning, so don't put me in there, bro.
00:42:51.370 - 00:42:55.770, Speaker A: All right, yeah, don't fade. Break. I think that's a lesson we've learned over the past few months.
00:42:55.840 - 00:43:16.242, Speaker C: What's up, everyone? March is approaching fast, and I want to give you another reminder not to miss out on Das London. It is coming. It's right around the corner, and it's in March. From the 18th to the 20th, we have three full days of content. This is your chance to bump shoulders with some of the world's top executives and have open dialogue with both attendees and speakers. We're going to be focusing on a range of topics that I'll let Ren discuss for you.
00:43:16.296 - 00:43:53.050, Speaker A: First on the list, we have bitcoin catalyst, the halving, and spot ETF. Next, we have a view from the buy side from investors on things like strategy, portfolio allocation, and more. We also have a topic on rwas, tokenization and stablecoins, which I think we can all agree are going to play a large role in crypto's future. We'll also talk about global regulatory frameworks like compliance, best practices, and the evolution of global standards that are shaping the global investment landscape. We'll also have someone from the institutional front to talk about infrastructure such as banking and payments, with financial giants like Visa and JPMorgan. And last on the list, the macro case for digital assets. So don't miss out on this monumental event.
00:43:53.050 - 00:44:04.970, Speaker A: Seats are limited, so be sure to register today by hitting the link in the description and using the promo code zero x ten to save 10% on tickets. See you in London next. Sam, do you want to give us your hot seat coup throne?
00:44:05.130 - 00:44:38.602, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. You actually alluded to it in the news and governance updates a little bit ago, but I've got ordinals in the cool throne today. No one seems to really realize it because it's hard to find a good data source on ordinals volume globally as well as it's difficult to just basically get any data on bitcoin ordinals as well as holistic views of NFT volumes, generally speaking. But some numbers, just to put it into perspective, node monks did 2.75 million of volume over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin puppets did 2.4 million and r six did 1.25
00:44:38.602 - 00:45:12.214, Speaker D: million, and mad lads and Tenzorians, on the other hand, did six hundred k and two million, respectively. And then the two largest buy volume collections on Ethereum were D gods and Azuki, and each of them did 1.8 million roughly. So ordinals are dominating the volume wars and no one seems to really notice. I was looking at Magic Eden's numbers earlier today and I saw that 43,000 unique ordinals buyers were active on the platform in February, versus 73,000 for Salana. So there's still more users in interacting with Salana based NFTs on magic Eden. But despite this fact, they brought in $1.5
00:45:12.214 - 00:46:15.638, Speaker D: million of fees on ordinal's purchases versus just 1 million for Salana. So in my opinion, all of the signs are pointing to ordinal season continuing, if not heating up even more from here. And I think it's just the early innings. Like if you go into some of the discords and some of these projects that are well connected with good founders with good intentions who are early in ordinals, there is random airdrops, whitelist giveaways for minting things for free, and you can pretty much earn your money back just paying attention to these discords and participating in some of these things that are popping up. And it reminds me so much of Ethereum nfts before last cycle when they really took off, and it's not really fair to compare them because obviously they've already gotten a lot of hype so far. But I just think the market size for this thing is really large and it's also super memeable because there's a ton of people who hate the idea of ordinals, and then you can just respond to them and be like, thanks for storing my ordinal on your bitcoin node that you're running in your basement as a maxi. It's so perfect and it makes me laugh.
00:46:15.638 - 00:46:54.790, Speaker D: And I think some people are worried about the longevity as l two s in the bitcoin ecosystem proliferate. But I kind of look at the Ethereum landscape and we never saw that actually happen with l two s. Like you look at arbitram, optimism, et cetera, NFT volumes, and it is laughable in comparison to Ethereum main net. And so I think there's true value in having these fine art collections on the actual base layer. So this is a space I'm watching really closely, especially as rune season kicks off around the having in April. Yeah, ordinals on the cool throne was a very easy pick for me this week, but curious if you guys have any thoughts.
00:46:55.370 - 00:47:54.486, Speaker E: Yeah, I strongly agree that ordinals are something to look out for. I definitely am comparing it to ethereum nfts especially last cycle, we saw how crazy things got as eth's price rose. People were just looking for places to park their capital and flex their newfound wealth, and NFTs were the perfect example of that. And we're seeing that play out in bitcoin land, which I think will honestly be a much bigger market given just the size of bitcoin itself. The fact that ordinals are popular in many different geographies around the world, the fact they've had this momentum already despite being extremely hard to buy, or like you said, find data. Like, I just think this trend is going to continue for a pretty long time. I'm definitely watching the ordinal space, and I also am watching magic Eden, which huge credit to them, because tensor has kind of been eating their lunch when it comes to Solana NFTs and their volume and trading, et cetera.
00:47:54.486 - 00:48:17.860, Speaker E: But this pivot to trading bitcoin ordinals, I think, is a huge one. They're definitely, I believe, the primary place in which people are trading these ordinals. They have a great user experience and yeah, I'm just huge credit to them for finding this niche and deciding to basically pivot a little bit, but they're really finding their footing now.
00:48:18.710 - 00:49:11.060, Speaker B: Yeah. And it seems that when it comes to NFTs and them doing good, the playbook is that you need to find a group of people who get along well and create these strong communities. But then you need to have an opposite side to those people who are yelling at people that, no, don't inscribe these things on chain. Or last cycle you had just like, overall people saying that, why would anybody buy these jpegs? I can just copy paste this and whatever, and that seems to be like good fuel for these things to start growing larger and larger. Also, big shout out, Sammy, because you talked about this about like two or three months ago already, and I think you got it back then, but I have to give your credits.
00:49:11.910 - 00:49:25.480, Speaker D: I love it. Thanks, Rick. I'm curious, though. Out of you four, who here or out of you three? God, I'm counting myself. Who here has actually bought an ordinal? Has everyone? Because I'm willing to bet at least one of the four of us has not.
00:49:26.170 - 00:49:32.460, Speaker E: I have not. But I've gone to magic Eden and thought about buying one.
00:49:33.710 - 00:49:35.980, Speaker A: I have. I've bought a few.
00:49:36.750 - 00:49:37.942, Speaker E: Have you, Brick?
00:49:38.086 - 00:49:57.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I played around with it and I'm still so mad to myself because the node monkeys mint was on Christmas day, I think, or something like that, where I was thinking like, nah, I don't have time to look at this right now. And now I'm really beating myself for it.
00:49:57.990 - 00:50:38.800, Speaker D: I think everyone is, but I just think that's a testament to the fact that it's still pretty early. It's totally new infrastructure. You need to download a new wallet, you need to get used to the denominations. There's just friction there and the migration is happening very slowly. But I find it interesting that even in this group of us fort, there's not 100% of us who are super crypto native, always on chain doing different stuff, trying things that haven't bought an ordinal yet. If we haven't done it, there's so many other people who are going to do it. And I guess I should say that this is not financial advice and I wouldn't go too crazy here, but I just find the dichotomy of this and the slow migration over to ordinals like very interesting.
00:50:39.970 - 00:50:43.520, Speaker E: Yeah, just give me more fomo. No, it's fine.
00:50:44.370 - 00:51:38.526, Speaker A: I think maybe from a slightly mid take, bitcoin is the largest asset, or like crypto asset. I know crypto asset is not an actual term, it's one that Gary Gensler made up. But bitcoin is the largest asset by market cap. Right? And that capital has been sitting there for God knows how long and has always been unproductive. There's probably like God knows how many people sitting on tens of millions of bitcoin and they've been looking for something to do, some way to flex your status instead of just holding like 20 million in bitcoin in a cold wallet. And ordinals, like ordinals is your solution, right? There has to be an insane amount of chinese wheels and then add into that the bitcoin ecosystem in general and sort of productive uses of your capital, whether that's like restaking with Babylon and generating yield on your bitcoin. I feel like people are not ready for bitcoin city season.
00:51:38.526 - 00:51:54.920, Speaker A: And the metric I like to use is how much bitcoin stuff there is on my WeChat feed. And just every single month there is more and more bitcoin. All of these chinese vcs are investing into completely pointless bitcoin l two s. But the money is flowing there for sure.
00:51:55.690 - 00:52:31.154, Speaker D: And then on top of that, it's like if you've got $20 million of bitcoin, you're probably going to be pretty hesitant to deposit into one of these l two s, because let's face it, they're not real l two s. You can't actually use bitcoin, the asset, on a L2, in a completely secure and trustless manner. So I think you're going to forego those trust assumptions and maybe dabble in the ordinals market instead. Because it is self custodial, it's all on chain like, you're completely secured by the bitcoin network. This is a completely safe thing to partake in. So if you're going to speculate, you're probably going to do it at the ordinal layer. And you're probably like.
00:52:31.154 - 00:52:53.050, Speaker D: Because there's nothing else. Like with Ethereum, you have nfts, which is a niche, but you also have defi, you have gamefi, you have all of this other stuff that you're competing with mindshare for. But on bitcoin's base layer, it's ordinals and that's it. So I guess now I'm really giving westy FoMo, so maybe this is a good time to pass it over to Ren for his hot seat or cool throne.
00:52:53.550 - 00:53:18.434, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks, Sam. This week I have world coin in the hot seat. I wouldn't say it's like entirely in the hot seat, but a little in the hot seat just because price went up a bit too fast. Wordcoin is currently sitting at 1 billion market cap, but it's sitting at 81 billion fdv. So this is like low float, high fdv to the max. It's ripped up forex in the past month.
00:53:18.434 - 00:53:50.960, Speaker A: And to be honest, the supply dynamics are relatively interesting. 75% of the supply is earmarked for the community and unlocked over 15 years. 6 billion out of the total 10 billion in supply is allocated for users. And the token is only given out when people sign up. Right. So technically, the higher the liquid supply, the more adoption it should have in terms of people that have scanned the eyeball. But I also know that they've recently started out giving sort of worldcoin token rewards to just people that have a wallet account already.
00:53:50.960 - 00:55:03.154, Speaker A: I think, sure, on one hand you can be cynical and saying this is disgusting, like, worldcoin shouldn't be at 81 billion ftv, but I think OpenAI Sora was kind of the catalyst, right? People were like, holy crap. Some of the videos you saw come off OpenAI Sora were shockingly realistic, and I'm not sure how Worldcoin and proof of personhood will be the solution for that, but just sort of like the narrative in saying you need some way to prove either a human is a human or some content. Was human generated plays really well into Worldcoin's vision? Sure, they only have like 3 million wallet addresses today. I don't think a proof of personhood solution might solve AI generated content in its current state, but the narrative is definitely there. And then on the other hand, you have sort of tangential catalysts, right? I think conference season is just getting started. You have Eve Denver starting this week, and the amount of AI events at Eve Denver, both by sort of large vcs or large AI projects is so numerous, there's an event every day and it's packed. And I think as conference season happens that circle jerk becomes really strong.
00:55:03.154 - 00:55:34.960, Speaker A: People go like, oh my God, oh my God. AI AI is going to change everything. And from a slightly more like left curve perspective, right? Like Falcoin reached like 400 billion FTV and that thing probably makes like six digits in revenue or probably less a year, maybe more. I'm not really sure. I haven't checked. Don't hate me if I get it wrong, but if Falcoin can reach 400 billion FTV last cycle, what could worldcoin reach? And then Sam Alman's saying like, oh yeah, I want to raise like $7 trillion for my chip company. And Worldcoin is kind of like Sam Altman starting.
00:55:34.960 - 00:55:56.420, Speaker A: So yeah, I think it's going to be like a hated token. It's up so much already. But I think there's still so much upside. Of course not financial advice, but I feel like the catalysts are there. However, there are definitely supply unlocks and more supply coming online. So that's something to always be wary of.
00:55:58.890 - 00:57:21.658, Speaker B: This isn't financial advice either, but seeing this world coin rally has kind of changed my mindset of how I think about allocating in my own portfolio. Before this kind of bull market started, I was thinking that, okay, if the FDB is really too high, I'm not going to touch that thing because everybody knows that it's not sustainable. But now I understand that that's not true in crypto land right now. So what I'm trying to do is find these low float, high FDV projects or things that could become high FDV and then looking for narratives or drivers that are hard to quantify the potential of as in is with this world coin stuff. Nobody really knows what's going to happen with AI or how fast AI will go forward and how this world coin stuff even ties into it. So it becomes a narrative that's kind of easier to sell. And yeah, I don't really have a problem with low float, high FDB stuff, but I just think that it's funny that at some point it has to come down and people are still willing to bet on it and gamble on it, which is an interesting phenomenon, because I don't think we see that in trade.
00:57:21.658 - 00:57:24.740, Speaker B: Five markets right now or ever, pretty much.
00:57:27.030 - 00:58:06.702, Speaker E: Guys, the number is $7 trillion. People are definitely pricing this based on how much money Sam Aldman is raising. That is a quarter of the US's GDP last year. That is an incredible number. And so as a result, obviously these things get repriced. And yeah, there's some factors of the fdvs pushed out over 15 years, et cetera, but people are definitely pricing in that world coin, I guess, achieved its vision of becoming Ubi. I know Sam Alman right now is conducting studies on UbI and its impact on the world.
00:58:06.702 - 00:59:32.890, Speaker E: And if those studies come back positive, he's obviously going to point to, hey, I've world coins, this private sector, decentralized, open Ubi is probably the better solution, et cetera. And I think the higher this thing goes, the more valuable it becomes, et cetera. But on sort of the flip side, with such a high FDV and constant unlocks, and the fact that if this does achieve, quote unquote, ubi, people will be selling the world coin for dollars or the currency of their choice. So there's constant sell pressure and there needs to be buyers on the other side in order to sustain the price level. So the question is, I guess, who is the buyer on the other side? There needs to be stuff built on worldcoin's chain that potentially uses their proof of humanity system, et cetera, maybe who is on the bid side is Sam Altman or similar figures just trying to prop up the value of this thing in order to create a sustainable flywheel, et cetera. But yeah, I just don't see how at some point this doesn't slowly unwind as the sell pressure builds up and there's not enough bids. But that could take many years, and especially as the AI progress continues at the rate it has, this thing could continue to pump and pump higher than we could even imagine.
00:59:34.990 - 00:59:57.522, Speaker D: Yeah, regretfully, I have faded the AI narrative for the most part. I've got like a small bag of towel, but nothing significant. And it's just something that I've kind of come to terms with. I'm like, okay, this is not something I understand at all. The fdvs are going to get ludicrous. This is going to be a game of hot potato for maybe one week or maybe two years throughout the cycle. I really don't know.
00:59:57.522 - 01:00:24.300, Speaker D: But what it comes down to for me is I don't actually believe that today or in the next few years that there's a genuine crypto use case with AI that's going to make a material worldwide impact. I do think that will come eventually, but like most things in crypto, I just think it's a little bit too early, and I'd much rather wait until prices are super, super low in the middle of a bear market after the bubble pops and start looking at things then. So that's kind of my plan of attack for this.
01:00:25.790 - 01:01:11.046, Speaker A: I think the universal basic income point that Wesley mentioned was really interesting. I saw a tweet this morning. I don't know if this is true, I need to verify it, but someone wrote that starting this week, 10 million worldcoin tokens, which is worth roughly 80 million as of current prices, will stream a week to retail wallets over the following two weeks, and will continue doing so every two weeks after at higher rates. So if you take their 3 million wallet address wallet addresses today, that's roughly $25 per wallet. Sure, that isn't a lot, but it's a good flywheel. And I would guess the majority of world coin like Orb scans are in developing countries. And in those countries, $25 goes a super long way.
01:01:11.046 - 01:01:57.960, Speaker A: And if you're making $25 a week from just scanning your eyeball, you are definitely shitting scanning your eyeball to all of your neighbors and think, yo, dude, just go sign your eyeballs. You can buy God knows what for two weeks with this $25 payout. And there was this interesting point that worldcoin had in their white paper. So the full paragraph reads, while network effects will ultimately come from useful applications being built on top of the financial and identity infrastructure, the token is issued to all network participants to align their incentives around the growth of the network. This is especially important early on to bootstrap the network and bypass the code start problem. But the last sentence is, this could lead the worldcoin token to become the wildest, sorry, the widest distributed digital asset. Maybe the wildest too.
01:01:57.960 - 01:02:56.650, Speaker A: But I think that's a very possible scenario. Say, five years later, Worldcoin orb scans have gone absolutely ballistic. There's more people that own worldcoin, the token, than bitcoin or ethereum around the world. And sure, maybe there aren't that many use cases for it, but I think at some point, this is like a personal thesis of mine. I think at some point, big tech has a reckoning moment where marketers say that, okay, I don't want to spend my ad budget on your social media platform because 90% of the views and interactions and clicks are completely fake, inorganic, or different bot activity, and a world coin appears on your doorstep and say, hey, we're the only proof of personhood solution in the world with 50 million sign ups. Use us or you lose 50% of your revenue because people and marketers have been paying for nothing in the past, like five years. And I think that moment will come.
01:02:56.650 - 01:03:07.710, Speaker A: I don't know when it will come, but I think the AI problem of sort of like, generated content, fake activity, will only go exponential from here, for better or for worse.
01:03:09.810 - 01:03:12.320, Speaker E: Is WlDaI money.
01:03:14.690 - 01:03:17.620, Speaker A: It could be. I'll tell you what, it's definitely not eth, though.
01:03:18.230 - 01:03:20.420, Speaker D: Just don't let stride get a hold of it.
01:03:22.150 - 01:04:03.758, Speaker A: I guess just one last point, that this is super random thoughts, too, but Sam was saying he doesn't see a very valuable use case for AI. But if you read Brick's AI X crypto report, you know that I think Brick is relatively bullish, like AI agents. And I think AI agents right now, they may not make a lot of sense. It's just like AI agents, like transacting on chain. They're helping you bet they're helping you trade in the prep markets. They're helping to do super rudimentary transactions. But I think at some point, AI replaces a large amount of white collar, or even maybe not blue collar, but white collar work.
01:04:03.758 - 01:04:50.480, Speaker A: And all of those could be AI agents built on some decentralized open source protocol, right? And then the community sort of submits their own AI agents. Who has the best, I don't know, the data entry, AI agent, Excel, DCF AI agent. And that has an incredible amount of value capture. Because if you're a company and you're paying some investment banker, like, one hundred and fifty k a year, and you can pay an AI agent like, sixty k a year, and he does like, a relatively okay job, too, you probably take that five years down the road. And having all of that built on, like, an open source, decentralized network is a pretty damn cool idea that I think has actual value in the world of course, it's probably a bit too early and there's a lot more AI ideas that I'm personally excited about, but I think that's just like a random idea ahead.
01:04:51.730 - 01:05:24.282, Speaker D: I just think people get too caught up and ahead of themselves with all this stuff. Like, yes, Chat GPT is awesome, don't get me wrong. But do you guys actually, I use it in niche use cases and it also takes me three or four tries to get the prompt to spit out exactly what it is that I'm looking for. These things are not tools that are ready for mass adoption on their own, in my opinion. And now we're just sprinkling crypto on top and saying different buzwords. That's honestly what I see. It feels like a forced narrative on crypto Twitter, to be completely honest.
01:05:24.282 - 01:05:36.480, Speaker D: I know that's going to be a hated take, and once again I'm going to double down on the fact. I do think AI agents will be huge. I just think it's going to take five to ten years to actually play out and we're going to see a lot of booms and busts in between.
01:05:38.530 - 01:06:29.310, Speaker B: I actually think that's a pretty good take, especially comparing at the valuations some of this stuff is going at. I was just recently thinking about this. Now it's probably easier than ever to just create some documents, throw some buzwords in, create your Twitter page for some AI related project, and then just release a token and say that, okay, we're going to build this at some point. Now we're doing this and this stuff, and then let's say in two years we have a good product and your token valuation will go through the sky because everybody is just trying to front run each other in this vertical. And as you said earlier, not a lot of people understand what's happening. So it's like, I see AI, I buy and that's the thesis.
01:06:31.250 - 01:07:14.182, Speaker E: Yeah, to respond to Sam, I don't think people are overhyping the progression with which AI is continuing at its rate. Like a year ago, we were barely using chat GBT, and it's gotten so much better in the past year. And we have products like last week that were announced, Sora from OpenAI, you have text to video, et cetera. And I think just the progression of how good AI is, is just going to increase exponentially over the next few years. And so I don't think people are overhyping how important and quick AI is developing. However, I definitely agree that a lot of these AI related projects within crypto are getting overhyped and overvalued. But as Brick said, people just.
01:07:14.182 - 01:07:49.020, Speaker E: They don't know what's going on. They just see this progression, and they just spray and pray at what they think could be a potential big solution because they know the market for this stuff will be huge. But no one really knows what kind of solutions will actually work, which ones will win, et cetera. People are just saying, I need to get exposure to this thing immediately, and just, like, throwing money at it. But, yeah, eventually this thing will unwind. There'll be the top of a bubble, and then, as Sam said, maybe that's the time to bid when things sort of calm down for a bit.
01:07:50.990 - 01:08:01.500, Speaker A: Tldr AI to infinity. Long term, everything is overvalued today. I think that's probably a good point to close it out, but thanks, Rick and Wesley, for coming on and see you guys next week.
