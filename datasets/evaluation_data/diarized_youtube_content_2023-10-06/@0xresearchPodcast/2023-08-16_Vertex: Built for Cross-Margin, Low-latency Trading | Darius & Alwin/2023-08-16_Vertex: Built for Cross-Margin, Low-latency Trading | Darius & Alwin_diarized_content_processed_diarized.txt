00:00:00.170 - 00:00:26.150, Speaker A: It sounds really boring, but the strategy is to have a really fucking good product that works really well and will give you tokens and build community while we do it. You know, a lot of crypto is just have a ton of bullshit marketing and then put a product out and the product just underwhelms. We decided to focus on having a really good product first and then just let word of mouth through the rocks.
00:00:28.650 - 00:01:11.778, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Before we dive into today's episode, I want to give a quick shout out to our new sponsor, Hexins, the most hardcore security team in web three. Pioneering in ZK and novel cryptography, Hexins is trusted by tier one projects like Polygon, including their new ZKE EVM mantle Risk, Zero, Lido, one inch, and more. You'll hear more about them later in the episode, but they will be at booth eight three two at permissionless. So if you go up to them, be sure to say hi, and don't forget to mention Zero X research when requesting a quote, and they will give you a free web two pen test with the purchase of an audit. Speaking of that, I want to give another opportunity for the listeners. 30% discount code using Zero X 30.
00:01:11.778 - 00:01:41.286, Speaker B: If you are looking to go to permissionless, it is in a little under a month now, September 11 through 13th in Austin, Texas. It's going to be a ton of fun. The whole research team will be there and we are pumped for the great speaker lineup as well. We just got word that Vitalik will be doing a virtual panel there. So again, it's going to be one hell of a conference. Really looking forward to that. Jumping into today's episode, we have a good interview with Darius and Alwin from Vertex Protocol, a nice perp decks being built on top of arbitrum.
00:01:41.286 - 00:01:56.466, Speaker B: And before we jump into that interview, as always, we are joined by some of the blockworks research analysts to jam on the latest market happenings with a game of hot seat cool throne today we got Ren pibbles and effort capital. Maybe. Ren, I'll throw things over to you first to kick us off.
00:01:56.568 - 00:03:02.598, Speaker C: I have researchers in general on the hot seat this week. There was an LVR space, or loss versus rebalancing space, that was basically trying to hash out how to figure out to solve loss versus rebalancing, which is one of the largest issues plaguing liquidity providers in Unison v three over the course of the space. Basically, researchers took like one and a half hours to barely come to the definition of LVR itself. And there's just a lot of back and forth and not specific for this space. I want to say researchers in general just like to do the sync where they make up words and then make everything a lot more complicated. So whether that's talking about roll ups, fraud proofs, CK, whatever finality, most often ethereum related, it seems like researchers have a really fun time just debating endlessly about semantics on Twitter or through blog posts. And I'm not sure how much value that know.
00:03:02.598 - 00:03:46.434, Speaker C: Sure, I do agree we have to come to a conclusion on what the problem at hand that people are trying to solve is, but it feels like everyone's just more interested in being correct or sort of like circle jerking each other. Going back to the LVR space specifically, right? Not exactly targeted at the speakers for that space, but with UniSoP X. UniSOP before UniSop X. I think some can see that as UniSOP itself giving up on solving the AMM LVR problem and just going straight to an RFQ model. And similar to UniSOp before. Right. Rather than Unisoft themselves trying to solve that problem, Unisoft is asking the community to help solve that problem for them.
00:03:46.434 - 00:04:28.674, Speaker C: And I think that's another trend that we've seen recently, actually. A lot of protocols are banking on researchers or external research teams to sort of help them figure out their problems rather than trying very hard at doing it themselves. It's not that I don't think they're interested, it's just that the problems that they were trying to solve are so complicated. You really need the brain power of the entire community to come together. Right. But I don't know, at least for us researchers, it can be kind of confusing sometimes because you read about something, and I think this happens the most often with roll ups, and you thought you knew how roll ups work, what people are actually talking about. And then you read one Twitter thread and one blog post and you are back at square one.
00:04:28.674 - 00:04:37.620, Speaker C: You have no clue what is happening again. And yeah, that's why I'm putting them on a hot seat this week. And nothing against them, they're solving important problems.
00:04:38.310 - 00:04:39.166, Speaker B: Yeah, that was funny.
00:04:39.198 - 00:04:39.310, Speaker A: Right?
00:04:39.320 - 00:04:55.900, Speaker B: When you mentioned the mental massaging that goes on to change definitions and whatnot, l two s came straight to my mind. I feel like that's always going on over there in that space. But what was your takeaway from the LVR space? What's the TLDR on LVR? And what's the leading idea on how to fix it?
00:04:56.350 - 00:05:52.842, Speaker C: Yeah, without going too much into the definition of LVR, because I walked away with a slightly confused definition too. I've had a bit of discussion with other people I'm following, but the easy, super simple way to think about it is it's the cost to liquidity providers. When external actors are able to rebalance liquidity at a better execution price, most often on a sex, versus the Dex's liquidity itself. There's some other definitions that kind of get squeezed in there, some theoretical, some practical. For example, there's this concept of realized spread, which introduces markouts from tradfi market making and looking at where your price is executed versus where the price is, for example, like five minutes later. But LVR, there's two main solutions to try to solve that, right? The first is an auction mechanism. The second is dynamic fees.
00:05:52.842 - 00:06:37.606, Speaker C: Both of them have their unique trade offs, and I think there are teams working on both of them simultaneously, and I don't think they are mutually exclusive solutions. It's very possible that you can have auctions plus dynamic fees, but I don't think anyone is close. I'm very excited to see dynamic fees sort of come into play with unison v four and hooks, and perhaps auctions potentially come into play with hooks, but also I feel like that will probably take a bit longer and come a few years down the road. There's a lot more infrastructure that needs to be figured out with auctions and designing like a fair and open auction mechanism, especially when you consider that running an auction sort of affects everyone downstream of the MEV supply chain, including searchers, builders, proposers, and whatnot.
00:06:37.798 - 00:07:06.680, Speaker B: What's the value add of measuring versus rebalancing though? Like, okay, if I'm just thinking, let's say I'm just a passive DFI user and I have $500 of ETH and $500 of USDC, and I want to throw that into a univ three pool at a certain rate. Let's not make it complicated. Let's actually use a Univ two pool at a certain range. I was never going to rebalance that position in the first place. So is LVR even a fair metric to be determining what my loss in this sense is?
00:07:08.810 - 00:07:50.050, Speaker C: I think it's still fair in the sense that there is value being captured out of the liquidity pool that you are not getting any share to. Sure, before you could argue that before MeV was a thing in a univ two pool, no one was really doing cross sex index arbitrage, and so there isn't that much value being lost in that sense. But now that value is being captured by someone else. I think the argument has sort of become some of that value should be returned to the liquidity providers because without them, that value wouldn't sort of exist.
00:07:53.770 - 00:08:01.274, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that makes sense. I get how dynamic fees make more sense.
00:08:01.312 - 00:08:01.466, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:01.488 - 00:08:31.460, Speaker B: If you're trading at a super volatile time, then chances are you'll get a larger arbitrage, so you should be getting charged more. And also, trading against size seems to be a fairly common way to deter against this. If you have a massive trade coming through after a series of small trades, that's likely the arbitrage trade. So making that user pay more kind of hits there as well. So the dynamic fee thing, especially based around volatility, makes a lot of sense to me. But what about the auction mechanism? Can you explain potentially what that would look like?
00:08:32.070 - 00:09:03.834, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I think the simplest implementation of an auction is that on Ethereum, there are twelve second block times. So basically, whoever is able to capture the price change on a sex within that twelve second block time probably makes the most money within the block. Right. Most often you want to be the first to submit that transaction. So that's known of top of block. And basically you can run a simple auction where to do like a unison v four hook or do some protocol enforcing.
00:09:03.834 - 00:09:22.206, Speaker C: That's a completely different discussion. But you can auction off the right to be the first trade in a liquidity pool. And basically whoever is bidding on that would bid for the right to sort of r about the price difference that's occurred in the previous 12 seconds. And that's like the simplest possible implementation of an auction mechanism.
00:09:22.318 - 00:09:31.590, Speaker B: Yeah, that's pretty interesting. We got to have somebody on the pod to walk us through what that would look like at a super complex level, but effort capital. Who you got in the hot seat or cool throne this week?
00:09:31.740 - 00:10:09.378, Speaker E: Yeah, I have the cosmos hub, surprisingly, and the community on the hot seat instead of typically the cool throne when I'm usually on here, bull posting or bull talking about the cosmos ecosystem. So this past week, the community is currently actively voting on prop eight one eight. The exact title of this prop is punish equivocation of neutron by puffmos and citizen Cosmos. So just give a little context and backstory right now. Earlier this year, the Cosmos hub went live with interchange security. V one is called replicated security. What that allows the Cosmos hub to do is provide security as a service.
00:10:09.378 - 00:10:56.894, Speaker E: Essentially, it's like Eigen layer does e three staking where it extends ethereum security to other middleware protocols. Cosmos hub is able to pretty much leverage its active validator set and the atom stake to the hub to secure other chains called consumer chains around the hub. The first consumer chain for the hub is neutron, which is like a cosmosm generalized smart contracting platform. What ended up happening was about a week and a half ago there was a rolling upgrade of neutron where all these validators were pretty much obviously expect to upgrade neutron to the latest version. Two validators during this rolling upgrade that was unplanned actually ended up double signing a block. So typically in proof of stake networks, this is a no no. It's a penalty if you double sign a block.
00:10:56.894 - 00:11:42.850, Speaker E: I think Ethereum has some type of slashing mechanism with cosmos chains. If you double sign, not only do you get slashed, there's also potential possibility of tombstoning that validator with tombstone means permanently banning them from the active set, which is a really big deal. Replicated security. So typically if you do double sign, you're tombstoned and you're slashed with replicated security. When it went live, it didn't allow for automated slashing of validators if they double signed or do something nefarious to a consumer chain. The reason being is because it's very new tech. And the concern was what if a consumer chain accidentally slashed validators when they didn't do anything wrong? So it was kind of supposed to be like a false positive signal.
00:11:42.850 - 00:12:34.660, Speaker E: The idea being the consumer chain would accidentally slash and put in harm's way the entire Cosmos hub security proposition due to again, like a false slashing event. The way that rubicate security launched was allowing governance to decide whether or not a validator or validators should be slashed. How this would work is a validator would do something bad on Neutron. A message over IBC would be sent to the cosmos hub saying, hey, cosmos hub community validator a did Xyz bad, and then there'd be a governance proposal brought to the community to vote on whether or not to slash or unslash. So that's exactly the situation we're in right now. So two validators during this rolling upgrade double signed a block. They're currently being asked, or the Cosmos hub community is currently being asked whether or not to slash these two validators or not.
00:12:34.660 - 00:13:11.318, Speaker E: Our current understanding of the situation and the community's understanding is that these two validators did not maliciously intent with intent to double sign these blocks. These just accidentally happened mostly due to poor operator, I guess, best practices. So there are certain things that they could have done during this rolling upgrade so that they didn't accidentally double sign this block. There's over 180 validators. There are 180 validators in the active set for the cosmos of today, and 178 of them did not double sign. But these two did. And there's a really contentious debate right now as to whether or not to slash and tombstone these validators.
00:13:11.318 - 00:14:09.166, Speaker E: Certain validators that think code is law thinks that they should be slashed. Because if this exact event happened on the Cosmos hub, if a validator double signed on the cosmos hub, they would have been automated, slashed and tombstoned. Why aren't we taking this exact same approach and setting the exact same precedent for consumer chains? Even though replicate security is sort of on training wheels right now? But there's a lot of validators right now that are looking at this and going, well, the risk return for validating consumer chains is not worth it. They're not really generating a lot of revenue for the cosmos hub today. And the validators don't want to be penalized for non intentionally double signing or doing something else negative to these consumer chains. So you see a lot of back and forth about what the right thing is to do. I'm of the opinion that just because you didn't intend to do something like in law, intent doesn't necessarily mean that you go off scot free.
00:14:09.166 - 00:15:02.830, Speaker E: God forbid. Like if you accidentally kill someone while driving, just because you intend to do it, doesn't mean there's a difference between murder and manslaughter, which is specifically around the intent of accidentally killing someone. I think you got to set a precedent here that these validators should be slashed and maybe neutron, or like the consumer chain, should reimburse the validator. And maybe we should vote after slashing and tombstoning these validators to untumbstone them and bring them back into the validator set. I think it's very important to set a social precedent. But this ultimately, in my opinion, can put the value prop of replicate security and interchange security in harm's way. If the entire value prop of security from the hub is all based on a social vote or governance vote, I think that loses the credible neutrality of the security service that the hub offers.
00:15:02.830 - 00:15:34.220, Speaker E: I guess the light side of this conversation is that there is going to be a planned upgrade for replicated security in the coming months to have automated slashing. But it's just like, unfortunate that this event is happening while replicated security is on training wheels. The Cosmos hub and the cosmos community, I think, really needs a big win. And this is of course, just a really bad thing to happen at the wrong time. But as always, the hub is kind of testing and prod and showing, I guess, the rest of the crypto ecosystem what it looks like to have.
00:15:36.270 - 00:15:36.538, Speaker A: A.
00:15:36.544 - 00:15:51.354, Speaker E: Really tough debate because typically this on chain governance is not a thing in Solana and Ethereum and other ecosystems. But I think there's a lot of lessons learned that Eigen layer and other shared security models are going to take from this event in the Cosmos hub.
00:15:51.402 - 00:16:00.946, Speaker B: What are the implications of what happened on neutron when there was this double signed transaction? Is that akin to a double spend or what's the TLDR on a double sign?
00:16:01.048 - 00:16:01.314, Speaker A: No.
00:16:01.352 - 00:16:36.574, Speaker E: So I think a double spend would actually have to happen if over 33% of the vote power actually all double signed and actually caused like a double spend attack for the hub. I'm sorry for neutron or a consumer chain. To be honest, I don't know the exact thing that went wrong. If these two validators did double sign, I don't think any of the state was actually messed up for neutron. I don't think there's anything that actually negative happened to neutron itself. But I think it's the unfortunate event that they did double, be. They could have been malicious in doing so.
00:16:36.574 - 00:16:45.970, Speaker E: We know for a fact that they weren't in this case. But it's just like the act of potentially trying to double sign a block is usually what's frowned upon in proof of stake networks.
00:16:46.630 - 00:17:58.786, Speaker C: I think my take here is that obviously there's different security mechanisms or different layers of security for different things in crypto where there's like a blockchain or like a middleware or like a DAP or like a roll up. But for something that sits at kind of like the highest level of providing interchange security or even like eth mainnet security. Right. And being a validator for that, I would always err to the side of slashing first and then having someone like a veto committee come in later and potentially undo that slash. Just because for these systems that purely depend or largely depend on crypto economic security, you need to have that guarantee that the stashing is going to happen instantaneously or like it's within the code, right? And then maybe, sure, you don't have a stash and then immediately burn it. You can move stuff to a community owned wallet and then there's like a committee of some sort that sort of votes on whether this stashing is vetted or it goes through. And I think I just kind of described Eigen Layer's Vettel committee.
00:17:58.786 - 00:18:06.730, Speaker C: And it's ironic that initially when I saw that committee, I was like, wait, I don't really like the idea that there's a committee to do that. So I'm kind of torn in between.
00:18:06.800 - 00:18:07.466, Speaker B: Now.
00:18:07.648 - 00:18:46.150, Speaker E: It's funny because to your point, Eigen layer takes a pessimistic approach first, ask questions later. The hub took a optimistic approach, which was the validators are optimistically, like, they're probably not doing anything nefarious, they're probably not being malicious. So let's give them the benefit of the doubt and let governance ultimately decide and put social consensus to the test. Probably was probably not the right thing to do. In hindsight, you probably should have slashed first, asked questions later. Because again, if these validators did this on the Cosmos hub, or if an osmosis validator double signed, they would have been slashed immediately. So I don't know why we're not extending those exact same rules that we already have in place and what the precedent is for other cosmos chains to this exact case.
00:18:46.150 - 00:19:28.578, Speaker E: But I think the problem is that there was communication between neutron and some of the Cosmos hub validators, that this upgrade would not be a slashable offense and that they would kind of have a get out of jail free card in the event of anything happening. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. And now these two validators are potentially being slashed. So I know where I firmly stand on this, but it's like a hotly debated topic in the ecosystem right now. Obviously, a lot of validators are concerned about whether or not they should even be validating neutron moving forward or another consumer chain because the risk is potentially not worth it. So, really interesting time, I guess, in the cosmos ecosystem's journey.
00:19:28.674 - 00:19:30.290, Speaker B: When does this go up for vote?
00:19:30.450 - 00:19:39.786, Speaker E: So it's currently being voted on. It went up. I think Zachy actually put it up for vote, but it went up for vote on the 9th and it ends on the 23rd.
00:19:39.888 - 00:19:42.620, Speaker B: Those 14 day voting windows are crazy.
00:19:42.990 - 00:19:43.740, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:19:44.670 - 00:19:47.290, Speaker B: Pibbles, who you got in the hot seat or cool throne this week?
00:19:47.440 - 00:20:29.494, Speaker F: Yes, I got a cool throne. And this one's on a seven day voting period, not a 14 day voting period. Because we like to get things done on the Ethereum ecosystem. I've got fracs coming in with Finres PBC. We picked this up in Govhub early last week. Essentially, Frax has incorporated a not for profit C Corp and they are going to be able to custody treasuries, mint and redeem USDP, which is Paxos's stablecoin and Mint and redeem USDC. This is a pretty big step for fracs towards their v three because the Frac stablecoin really died down over the past year or two.
00:20:29.494 - 00:21:05.160, Speaker F: I think all time high market cap was like 2.6 bill, and now it's sitting at 800 million. And most of that is just protocol owned for sure. So this is a big step in actually trying to get some usage for the frac stablecoin. We don't know what else is coming out for v three, but it's rumored that the full release will be this month. So just a really bullish catalyst for FXS. And it's awesome that we flagged this beforehand, and there will probably be a lot more governance stuff popping up in the near future.
00:21:06.490 - 00:21:06.902, Speaker G: Yeah.
00:21:06.956 - 00:21:44.530, Speaker B: Sam Martin couldn't join us for this recording today, but in his honor, I'll give a good strong agree there, pipples. This is really big for fracs. They needed to figure out an RWA strategy. Sam Kay, their protocol founder, made that very clear that there has to be some sort of RWA thing. They just hadn't really figured out what it seemed like the approach was going to be. And they're kind of siloing everything within this one entity. So this finrest PBC, whereas this is kind of in contrast to makers approach, where you have like five or six entities that you're working with to create these RWA deals and ultimately back die with these t bills.
00:21:44.530 - 00:22:22.986, Speaker B: So there's like two ways to look at that. One is siloing everything within this one entity should really make for ease of reporting and management and maintenance of these positions. But on the other side of the aisle, you'd say, okay, well, siloing within one entity, while it creates efficiencies, it also condenses your risk. And if finrest PBC fails to do anything important, then everything comes down crashing. So I'm really not entirely sure where I sit on that debate specifically, because there really isn't any creation history to FinRas PBC. It's a newly created entity. We don't really know who exactly is managing.
00:22:22.986 - 00:23:04.982, Speaker B: It just seems to be some extension of the Fracs team, which Sam Kay kind of kept his statement congruent with everything else. He says, it's like, look, when you use fracs, you're already exposed to the core team. That's why they have their frax ferry, because they're just adding another protocol within the ecosystem. There's no external reliance, and this is kind of that same thing. If you're using fracs, you're already relying on the core team to kind of create this product. So FinrasPBC is simply just the next extension of that into the real world asset side. So personally, I'm curious about who the people that are actually sitting on this board for this entity are actually managing these positions and making these deals and converting crypto into assets.
00:23:04.982 - 00:23:50.662, Speaker B: I know they mentioned their partner on this was Paxos, which is a very solid partner in my opinion. I think that's exactly the type of person or group that you want to see helping create this thing. And they have like a really clever mechanism on how they can pass assets back and forth between Finrez and the Frax protocol DaO itself. That's like using USDP, right? Because Finrez itself has the ability to mint and burn both USDC and USDP. I believe it was. So because of that, then if they want to pass revenue back to the DAO, they just simply convert yield from tbills into one of those two stablecoins, mint them through the circle or Paxos themselves, and then one transfer to the protocol treasury. And there you go.
00:23:50.662 - 00:24:03.790, Speaker B: So I really like their system. Honestly, I'm excited to see this thing come to life. I know Frax V three is going to have a lot of cool tricks to it, so I'm excited to see they're kind of beasts in the tokenomics game. So I'm excited personally.
00:24:04.610 - 00:24:04.974, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:24:05.012 - 00:24:28.150, Speaker F: And then you have this comboed with the actual Frax gov module, which has been in audit for a few months, and that's lining up as another catalyst for FXS. And it's finally going to be a fully on chain governed system. And I think it's truly something that's going to be competitive with compound's governance module. So a lot of fun stuff on the horizon.
00:24:28.730 - 00:25:20.614, Speaker C: I think there are a few things that excite me about this fracs fins PBC. The first is that if I'm not wrong, the treasury bond naturally converts to fracs upon expiry of the bond. And I think that should be a natural driver of growth over the long term. I'm not sure what the duration of the bonds that they're going to invest in are, but I think that'll probably provide some sustainable demand for fax itself. And the second thing is, someone correct me if I'm wrong here, is that they're going to run the same two token model with fax e with the fax bonds product. And I do think that open up some interesting opportunities, both in terms of higher yield from the two token model, but also from sort of like a similar loop trade, where you mint, like this fax bond, it has an inherently higher yield than whatever the cost of borrowing is. Then you borrow more and then you sort of mint more.
00:25:20.652 - 00:26:08.486, Speaker B: And that whole thing, that was pure speculation by me. I don't know if that's the case, but it makes sense, right? Like, with their frax eth stake frax eth model, they're able to separate the spot demand for the asset to actually hold frax ether versus the yield bearing side. I haven't checked on the distribution between the amount of frax EtH staked as staked Frax EtH, but that's something to monitor. But it wouldn't surprise me, right? Like, in this scenario, you do have the same spot asset with fracs itself and the ability to accrue yield through these RWA deals. So it would be kind of interesting nonetheless. And that kind of gives you the ability to juice the yields, right. If you only have 3%, but then only half the supplies opted into it, well, you can take that 3% and make it 6% for those that are interested in it.
00:26:08.486 - 00:26:12.840, Speaker B: So it is a smart mechanism. I don't know if that's what they're going to do here, though.
00:26:14.090 - 00:26:59.666, Speaker E: Paxos is probably a big winner here. I mean, between what they're doing with fracs, what they're doing with Pyongyang USD, or PayPal's USD token, in a crazy world, you might actually. I know you guys spoke about PYUSD last week. Will PayPal USD try to incentivize fracs in order to drive more liquidity to PYUSD and make that a dominant, stable coin to compete against USDC and tether? Very possible. It'd be really interesting to see what those dynamics look like in the next bull cycle. But as a notable fracs bear typically amongst the blockworks research group, I'm actually really excited about this. I think real world assets are the future of finance.
00:26:59.666 - 00:27:36.514, Speaker E: I think the Fracs team is extremely capable, but I think what I've had a trouble with historically is them doing too much at once and not having a core product as their killer feature. I think they have all really good products. They're building out a really good suite, but none of their products, I think, is like a number one or number two. It's usually like number three or number four in any one category. But I think this partnership with Paxos and their overall setup looks really promising and could really compete with Makerdow. So this is awesome. And I'm honestly turning bullish fracs you heard it here.
00:27:36.552 - 00:28:05.418, Speaker B: First effort Capital has flipped with news of the RWA injection into fracs, but I'll close this out here with a final cool throne. This one is close to my heart. Thorchain is the first protocol. That's what roped me into crypto. The beautiful tokenomic design they have was what woke my eyes up. I was like, damn. Okay, tokens are very interesting tools that you can use to bootstrap use of your protocol, and I'm putting them in the cool throne this week with the release of their new lending market.
00:28:05.418 - 00:28:46.790, Speaker B: So, real quickly. Thorchain is a cross chain Dex that basically uses a validator set to manage vaults on a series of connected networks. By doing this, they're the only bridge that I'm aware of that can include native bitcoin within this architecture and system. And so that kind of gives them this edge that nobody has really been able to figure out yet. And with that, they kind of said, okay, we've got the Dex thing under control. Let's keep building onto this thing similar like you've seen curve do this, and now we're also seeing it in another decks. And this kind of enables the idea that they wanted to effectively inject leverage into the system.
00:28:46.790 - 00:29:26.738, Speaker B: And by doing so, you can borrow any l one gas token. So think bitcoin, Ethereum, and the blue chip gas tokens at no interest, no liquidation, and against any supported asset on the network. So, for example, you could post bitcoin collateral in native BTC and borrow, let's say, USDC on Ethereum. And so the loan to LTV ratio that you get depends on the pool depths. So you get a lower collateralization rate with less utilization. So it kind of creates this incentive to be first, like, I'm the first one in, I can get a very generous loan. Whereas if you're like one of the people at the end of the line, you're going to get a worse LTV ratio.
00:29:26.738 - 00:30:10.478, Speaker B: And so rune is burned when loans are opened in this mechanism. And admittedly, I still have some reading to do on exactly how this whole design works, but essentially the protocol takes on the liability of repaying collateral when the loans are closed. So it's like a net benefit is realized when rune appreciates faster than collateral assets. And that's because, again, when I go and open the loan, a portion of that loan gets burned in rune. And then when I close the loan, some of that rune, or a dynamic amount of rune is minted again. So there is the potential where, let's say I open the loan, which burns 100 rune. And then based on price changes, actually, when I go to close this loan, it'll actually mint 110 rune.
00:30:10.478 - 00:30:51.218, Speaker B: And now I've created this net inflationary period. So that does definitely set off some alarm bells to a lot of people of this whole desk spiral risk. I think a lot of us are still scarred from the Luna days when the huge unwind kind of just created this mass supply increase where Luna basically inflated towards infinity, honestly. But there are circuit breakers to limit the exposure to this risk. And that's admittedly where my reading needs to occur, is exactly how these mechanisms can kind of control that. We had a great episode with Chad Barraford, one of the lead devs over there. Gosh, it was probably like eight months ago now, and we need to get him back on for a follow up just because of how cool and novel this mechanism is.
00:30:51.218 - 00:31:33.882, Speaker B: And ultimately to discuss the risks, because I think there is this really interesting situation that's unfolding. But again, rune has these extremely exciting tokenomics that ties the deterministic value of rune to the value of the non rune liquidity in the pools on the network. And so obviously, again, when you open up these loans, you deposit bitcoin into the network, you increase the amount of non rune liquidity in the network, so you improve the amount of trading that can be done, and you also improve the. This is some number go up technology, guys. We got it back. So again, I need to do more research on the actual risks that are at play here, but I am extremely excited about the new lending market on thorchain.
00:31:33.946 - 00:32:25.866, Speaker E: Yeah, just to jump in, I'm not an expert on the lending markets themselves. I was kind of reading the docs this morning. It sounds like the only betting, the thorchain is betting on rune outperforming any of the borrowed assets that a user deposits. Or I guess it thinks that rune is going to outpace bitcoin eth any of the collateral assets that are deposited into the protocol. It's pretty much taking the collateral that a user deposits and selling it and market buying rune with it. And if as long as rune outpaces the collateral asset that was deposited, the Thor chain protocol will remain solvent. In the event that the collateral asset that was deposited outperforms rune, and then a user goes to withdraw their collateral.
00:32:25.866 - 00:33:33.502, Speaker E: What it's going to do at a system wide level, let's say a system wide rune is insolvent. What it's going to do is it's going to mint rune up until the max cap, which I believe is programmed a 500 million rune. And in the event that minting up to the max cap does not make the system still solvent, what ends up happening is the borrowers from the protocol pretty much take a haircut. It's like they got liquidated effectively, but there's not like a hard liquidation to regular lending protocols point, but this kind of sounds like it's like makerdow taking the collateral asset and just market buying maker with it and then being long maker. It's pretty interesting from a game theory perspective because I guess you can argue if the token doesn't go up, is the protocol even going to be around for long term? It's like taking a really long directional bet on its own asset. It's definitely number go up technology, I think because it needs to go up in order for this to work. I guess the only difference between that and Luna is that Luna couldn't mint to infinite amounts.
00:33:33.502 - 00:33:52.860, Speaker E: So I think it's going to be really interesting to see how this plays out, what the solvency mechanism looks like for rune. I don't really understand the lending lever that they talked about, so I'm kind of in the same boat as you, Dan. I don't understand it fully, but like high level. Some good Ponzi tech, I guess.
00:33:54.430 - 00:34:11.120, Speaker F: Yeah, I think they need to court Igorov and Justin son to get over there and start putting it to the test. And then we can be there to short it whenever that time comes, whether it's six months or a year from now. But lots of ways to make money on this, so that's fun.
00:34:11.890 - 00:34:45.930, Speaker C: First of all, nothing that anyone said is financial advice. Please don't go and buy market by rune. Second of all, I think that's a new phrase that I'm going to use when something seems shady as hell and I have no clue how the risk management works. I'm just going to say this has interesting game theory mechanics, I think. I'm curious. I have a question for you, Dan, if you know the answer. Is this lending market effectively double dipping into the liquidity for the cross chain softs or is it still in some sense sidled?
00:34:46.350 - 00:35:24.034, Speaker B: I guess I don't totally know what you mean by double dipping, but effectively the way it happens is, okay, let's say I take bitcoin to the network to open a loan. When I deposit the bitcoin, it will be swapped into rune. And then let's say I had like a 200% cr, 50% Ltv, then five k rune would be burned. Let's just say my bitcoin was worth ten grand, the amount of bitcoin I deposited. And then $5,000 worth of that rune will be burned and the other 5000 will be used to be swapped into USDC. And then that is the piece that I will take as the borrower. So the idea is that the protocol has shifted off the risk onto, effectively, the rune holders.
00:35:24.034 - 00:35:27.114, Speaker B: That's who is taking the bet here, in my view.
00:35:27.232 - 00:35:40.330, Speaker C: So it is possible that if there's some really lopsided demand for borrowing or lending something, then the underlying liquidity pools that power dorchain also become imbalanced.
00:35:41.070 - 00:36:51.058, Speaker B: Well, there's always an arbitrage opportunity between the liquidity pools across the network, and they do quite a good job of actually staying balanced. So when a large borrow does come in, yes, there's a rebalance that needs to take place, but there's really good our bots that seem to be hooked up to thor chain and kind of maintain that ratio. But yeah, no, it's going to be interesting to watch this play out again. It's like one of those novel moments, honestly, for me, it was like when I was reading curve's new lending model, I was like, all right, there's a lot to unpack here, and I'm just scratching the surface, honestly, today. So I'm excited to dive deeper on this and really figure out, is this thing sustainable? But there are interesting throttle mechanisms to the death spiral point. You can always open new loans, but when you go to close loans, basically during times of volatility, or like a lot of closing of loans, it's like a throttle mechanism, so you'll get a smaller amount of your collateral back if you try to unwind your position at an inopportune time for the protocol. So yes, there's no liquidations and there's no interest payments, but you might get stuck in it depending on when you're trying.
00:36:51.058 - 00:37:30.430, Speaker B: I don't know, the bank run scenario here, you would definitely want to be first and not last. And if you are towards the end of the line, I think the incentive theory is like you just won't close your loan, which does benefit the protocol, right? Because at the end of the day, it is a Dex and liquidity is king. So that's kind of the idea. It seems to be scaling the liquidity pools to drive more than to drive the swapping operation, because there is no revenue generation from the lending market itself. But that's probably a good stopping point for hair. We've been talking for quite some time now, so I want to give another shout out to our new sponsor, Hexons. Definitely be sure to check them out at permissionless, or we'll include a link in the show notes of how to get in contact.
00:37:30.430 - 00:37:33.450, Speaker B: And now onto the interview with Vertex protocol.
00:37:33.530 - 00:37:36.254, Speaker D: All right, everyone, we are joined by Darius and Alwin.
00:37:36.302 - 00:37:37.122, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:37:37.176 - 00:37:37.346, Speaker G: Yeah.
00:37:37.368 - 00:37:59.246, Speaker D: So I was hoping you've already explained this a little bit on other podcasts, but I do like to hear your take firsthand. I want to give that to our listeners. So, can you explain kind of what you were building on terra in the first iteration of vertex and why you opted to build on arbitrum instead of a Cosmos app specific chain? I feel like that probably would have been the easier move from a development standpoint.
00:37:59.378 - 00:38:51.386, Speaker G: On terra, the initial motivation was to make a multi currency version of anchor. And then in order to do that, you want to hedge out the currency risk so you could earn, like, I don't know, 16% apy on euros or some shit. And in order to hedge out the currency risk, you want to have liquid perpetuals markets. So that was sort of the initial thought, which just have liquid perpetuals on terra. In terms of why we picked arbitrum. Yeah, it would be a lot easier to just go to another cosmos chain. But from the perspective of a team trying to build a product that actually has users, Cosmos didn't seem like it was going to make it the biggest chain on Cosmos sort of just went to zero in, like a week, so probably not a good idea to stick there.
00:38:51.386 - 00:39:46.582, Speaker G: And I think that looking at the terra projects that try to stay in the cosmos ecosystem. Yeah. Leaving it was probably like a good decision in terms of why arbitrum specifically EVM, is sort of the runtime that just has the most TVL and all the top blockchains all run EVM. So it seemed like a good way to be fairly agnostic to a blockchain we were on and have just a really good chance of whatever, of being able to build on something and having that work matter without sort of getting rugged from underneath us by the underlying chain being messed up. And arbitram happened to be the most performant EVM chain at that time that also had Tbl.
00:39:46.646 - 00:39:46.922, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:39:46.976 - 00:39:47.194, Speaker G: Yeah.
00:39:47.232 - 00:39:59.038, Speaker D: And then I was hoping just to get more of a high level overview of what is vertex. And I guess a lot of people probably don't know about vertex. So what is it and what makes it different from other margin dexes in the space.
00:39:59.124 - 00:40:39.580, Speaker G: Yeah. So vertex is sort of just like a futures exchange that's pretty capital efficient. And fast and easy to use, and then it's sort of also decentralized, but that's kind of like a side thing. So really it's like you can go trade on vertex as if you would trade on a centralized exchange. Takes like one click to do shit. If you're a market maker, you can get your orders placed on vertex in like ten milliseconds or whatever. I think we're much faster than FTX was, so that's really all we're doing.
00:40:39.580 - 00:40:46.762, Speaker G: Something that looks like a centralized exchange feels like a centralized exchange, but just so happens to be decentralized.
00:40:46.826 - 00:41:02.194, Speaker B: And so if we take a layer and peel back a layer here and look what's under the hood, what is it about your design that makes you be able to be faster than FTX or be able to have these high performance speeds? Is it the hybrid order book amm that you're using, or what exactly gives.
00:41:02.232 - 00:41:59.638, Speaker G: You that speed in terms of being faster than FTX? I don't think that's a function of us being really good. That's more of a function of FTX not being designed super well. But the sort of gist of it is that having a centralized server just makes things really performant because you don't have to wait for consensus and stuff. So the idea is, let's just make a compromise, right? Like users self custody, their shit. But we can process all trades and order placements optimistically on our own server. And that way it's not like you're not waiting for a light to travel from different nodes to each other and all of them to reach consensus. Yeah, it's just like centralized servers are fast and we like that.
00:41:59.724 - 00:42:21.260, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. And I think a big value add to a vertex in particular is the cross margin account architecture just kind of like offered by default. Can you guys kind of go into that and maybe talk about what cross margin accounts are and maybe why you think other margin dexes in the space haven't attempted to implement it? Like the GMXs, the DyDX of the world.
00:42:23.730 - 00:43:16.640, Speaker G: I think they are cross margin, but they don't have different. They don't allow us to use BTC as collateral or whatever, but it's just easier to implement isolated margin than cross margin. And something kind of tricky about cross margin is that we just have to care about all of the products on vertex for every transaction. So it does get a bit tricky and computationally expensive. But the idea behind cross margin is that every single one of your assets is sort of pooled together and they all count for each other. So you could have eth spot in an LP and have that collateralize your perp positions. So it just widens the design space of the degenerate shit that you can do.
00:43:18.130 - 00:44:20.094, Speaker A: I think, as well, a lot of users get in their head that cross margin is more risky than isolated margin, where I would argue kind of the opposite is true. If you have a portfolio of random isolated margin trades, which would be the case, say, on number of dexes you might use, you end up with this exposure to path dependency in a way that you don't really get with portfolio margin. So on vertex, if you've got a portfolio of long term shorts, you can do that in a way that's far less likely to get stopped out and with less capital than you would be able to do on, say, even a GMX v two or whatever, right? Because those isolated margin trades, you're liable to get stopped out when it goes up and stopped out when it goes down, and you end up with no position. You might be right in the end, but it doesn't balance you out the way that we will on our risk engine. It's a fairly common design structure in traditional markets. It's just not that common in crypto.
00:44:20.142 - 00:44:56.990, Speaker B: I want to give a quick shout out to hexins as we explore today's blockchain landscape. Let's take a moment to recognize them as a premier cybersecurity provider in web three, Hexins is trusted by tier one projects like Polygon, including a security review on their new polygon, Zke, EVM, Mantle, Risk, zero, Lido, one inch, Newbank, and more. Get a deep dive into your technology stack with the most comprehensive analysis and cybersecurity consulting, Hexons not only uses widely known methodologies and flows, but discovers and introduces new ones on a day to day basis. With over $55 billion secured, they cover everything from smart contracts to blockchain to web two pen tests.
00:44:57.650 - 00:45:03.774, Speaker D: Yeah, there's been nearly $7 billion of total value hacked in crypto's nascent history, so it's safe to say your team.
00:45:03.812 - 00:45:04.846, Speaker E: Has a lot on the line.
00:45:04.948 - 00:45:24.242, Speaker D: Don't skimp out. Take your security seriously and reach out to Hexans. Don't forget to mention zero x research for a free web two pen test with your partnership, and reach out to Hexans at Hexins IO. Find them in the links in the show notes, or reach out to them at permissionless. They'll be at booth 832. But without further ado, let's get back to today's episode.
00:45:24.306 - 00:45:53.330, Speaker B: Okay, interesting. And so you mentioned the use of LP tokens as collateral there. How has spot volume been trading on Vertex so far? And any plans to kind of drive more volume there as it's kind of essential for lps? Or how do you think about. There's a huge discussion around LVR and how lps helping is really not that profitable. Are you thinking about making this like a more profitable design space, or is that just kind of something that's maybe way down the roadmap?
00:45:54.630 - 00:46:28.294, Speaker A: I think the short answer is it's way down the roadmap. At the moment, we have four spot markets. They do decent ish volume, but I think you'll see when you look at any exchange, perps do way more volume than spot. And part of it's to do with capital efficiency. It's just more expensive from a capital perspective to do spot, although we have leveraged spot, so it's easier. It's still more expensive than doing perps. The other thing is just like managing inventory, and you have to be on a certain ecosystem.
00:46:28.294 - 00:47:24.906, Speaker A: So for us, we're on arbitrum at the moment. We're not cross chain, so getting inventory is just a pain in the like, it's way easier to do perks. So at the moment we don't. But like Alvin and I have discussed a few times, would there be a way we could design a more capital efficient, know, a similar kind of a product to a GLP that we could apply into vertex? It's just down our list of priorities, because at the moment we sort of get that synthetically right. By incentivizing market maker liquidity, we've got like the best firms in the world make markets on vertex. We incentivize them with our token, and they just make really good top of book liquidity for people to trade against. And that's better than anything we could do with any sort of semi algorithmic amm type design like GLP.
00:47:25.018 - 00:47:34.580, Speaker D: So would you say the primary use case for the AMM is just as a fallback mechanism in case the off chain sequencer that facilitates the order back book goes down?
00:47:35.350 - 00:47:46.894, Speaker G: Yeah, I would say so. And it's also sort of just like a decent place to park your funds if you just want to market. Make just like a one click way to bridge trade.
00:47:46.942 - 00:47:59.850, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Can you guys kind of explain what a user could expect in slow mo mode, as you guys call it, when the sequencer were to ever go down, you'd kind of fall back on just the contracts that reside on chain.
00:48:00.430 - 00:48:28.660, Speaker G: Yeah. So we don't really expect that to happen ever. So if we were to go down long enough for slow mode mode to matter, that means that we've just fucked up really bad as a company and that it sort of just makes. At that point, it's like, yeah, withdraw your funds. These guys are idiots. But Slowmo mode will let you withdraw your funds and get out of the system.
00:48:29.830 - 00:48:35.186, Speaker A: Basically gives a way for things to end orderly. If we were to not do our.
00:48:35.208 - 00:48:44.274, Speaker B: Job properly, and can you expand on. What do you mean by not do your job properly? Is that the sequencer going offline or which piece of the operation would fail?
00:48:44.322 - 00:49:21.362, Speaker G: In this case, yes. The way slimmer mode works is that normally all transactions get pipeline through the sequencer, and the sequencer submits them to the chain. You can also take your own transaction and write it to the chain directly, in which case the sequencer can choose to process it immediately or after a certain delay, you could also just forcibly push that transaction through. So what it would involve would be users, like, forcibly processing their withdrawals if the sequencer hasn't processed it in, I don't know, like, 3 hours or something.
00:49:21.496 - 00:49:41.818, Speaker D: Okay. And you guys charge, like, a flat 10% fee, I believe, on trades as a sequencer fee, because obviously you're batching all those up and you need to settle them on arbitrum. Is this, like, a revenue source for you guys? Do you ultimately make money off of those sequencer fees, or. Yeah, I guess. Is there a delta there?
00:49:41.984 - 00:50:15.990, Speaker A: No, we don't. In fact, we run a small loss on the sequencer. And just to clarify, it's $0.10, not 10% as well? Just to be 100% clear, I think you made a slight slip up, but, yeah, but basically, it's to kind of COVID most of the cost, and it stops people sending spam transactions to the sequencer, but it's literally just there for that. We end up covering, I think, roughly 30% to 50% of the gas cost, typically out of trading fees.
00:50:16.890 - 00:50:47.086, Speaker G: Yeah, it's a bit of a weird structure for trading. It's just that every match that we process, we have to pay a flat fee in gas, so we sort of have to propagate a flat fee over to the user. And it's been adjusted a few times based on the gas costs on arbitrum, but I'm pretty confident in that number trending downwards over time as arbitram gets better or other perform EVM chains come out.
00:50:47.188 - 00:50:53.220, Speaker D: That makes a lot of sense. And definitely $0.10, not 10%. I don't think many people would use vertex if that was the case.
00:50:53.990 - 00:50:58.462, Speaker G: Like $7 million this morning from 10% fee.
00:50:58.526 - 00:51:16.598, Speaker D: I'm also curious, so you guys want to decentralize that sequencer over time? I assume that's a problem that not even some of the best L two teams have actually been able to solve. So what are you guys thinking there? Is that just like a ways down on the roadmap as well, or is that a priority, and if so, what do you think the design will actually look like?
00:51:16.684 - 00:52:18.442, Speaker G: So depending on the regulatory situation, everything's sort of in flux. But I can speak to initial plans of how we would do something like that. So the first is that we're not trying to solve the same problem as an L two team because they're trying to solve for the general case. And for that, it's like order matters a lot. What we sort of care about is it's reasonably decentralized, and if it's like, someone can move your transaction around in a space of like ten milliseconds, probably doesn't matter. So we're just solving a really different problem than they are. And we would probably do something where we have a leading sequencer and that sequencer just outputs like a tape of what it thinks the incoming orders are, and other sequencers can sort of just check that order, right.
00:52:18.442 - 00:53:03.242, Speaker G: So what we can do is make sure that the leading sequencer isn't like, cheating by not adhering to price time priority within that tape of orderings. What we can't do is ensure that the leading sequencer doesn't lie about that tape. But realistically, if your latency is like on the order of ten milliseconds, which it is for us, then the leading sequencer can only move things around, like front run shit inside of that ten millisecond window. So that should be sufficiently small such that it doesn't really matter.
00:53:03.376 - 00:53:21.310, Speaker D: Okay. Yeah. And you guys are able to achieve this low latency? I think it has a lot to do with stork, your oracle provider. I'm just curious why stork? Is it just these exact needs that you guys need? And I'm also curious, using a less battle tested oracle provider, any worries?
00:53:25.970 - 00:54:38.634, Speaker G: It's a bit counterintuitive, but it's actually kind of nice to work with a new oracle provider because they just give really good customer support when they're like a startup and we can pester them about really dumb shit and they get back to us instantly. So that's really nice. I have serious doubts that Chainlink would have similar responsiveness in terms of stork's actual design. The way it works is that they just generate a bunch of prices off chain, and then they sign those prices, and then that can be validated on chain. So that actually works really well with our architecture, because we sort of know deterministically, what price is going to be reported, right? So that allows the state of our off chain matching engine to stay in sync with our on chain contracts at all times. And then the other thing is, it lets us pay gas to check what the prices are and push the prices when we feel like it, so it just saves a lot of gas. Whereas, for example, if we were to use something like pith on Solana every single time, we'd have to bridge that shit over wormhole and stuff.
00:54:38.634 - 00:54:52.000, Speaker G: That gets sort of, kind of a mess. And stork just does everything, like, really low latency, really low latency off chain, which is just really suitable to our use case.
00:54:53.250 - 00:55:04.580, Speaker B: Super interesting. And just you mentioning other chains got me thinking, like, do you guys have any interest in adding additional support for other chains, or you guys want to stay on arbitrum for the time being?
00:55:06.230 - 00:55:07.874, Speaker G: Darius, do you want to answer that?
00:55:07.992 - 00:56:07.578, Speaker A: I think, ultimately, we'd like to be able to provide assets across multiple chains. Again, it's like something we've discussed. The exact way we'll do it, we haven't decided on. But you can think of it, like, logically. You want all your liquidity and trading to be happening in one place, and you want all your capital on each account to be accounted for in one place as well, to keep capital efficiency. So that means if we were going to do a cross chain app, we wouldn't look like something like a uniswap, where you just fork the code and put a different version of the code on, like, 20 different chains. You're going to have to use a cross chain messaging service, like a wormhole, to bring assets in, take deposits on different chains, bring them to arbitram, and then have a user account interacting with the arbitrum instance of the protocol trade.
00:56:07.578 - 00:56:29.500, Speaker A: And then anytime they want to withdraw, they withdraw to their home chain. So it's quite a big piece of work, but Alwin's probably the guy to do it, given that he worked on wormhole previously and has exposure to this from previous roles. So we haven't got the exact plan mapped out, but we're pretty confident we can do something decent in that space.
00:56:30.910 - 00:56:57.000, Speaker B: That's super interesting. I kind of like your approach there. Yeah. Just because you mentioned Solana, that was the one on my mind. Given the loafy environment, could be attractive for building a Defi application like this, but that does definitely add some additional complexities around the cross chain messaging. Yeah, I'm just curious, how would that Ux look for the user, given that there would be some latency if you have to use that crosschain messaging platform?
00:56:59.770 - 00:57:39.790, Speaker G: I guess the way I would probably design it would be like, the way we validate signature is right now. The way everything's set up is that most of the things that people sign don't end up on chain, et cetera. It just goes to our matching engine directly. So they don't actually have to sign a transaction for arbitrum in theory. Right. So the ideal UX would be they sign in on, let's say, optimism. They have to send a transaction on optimism to deposit, and then on the back end, we bridge that shit to arbitrum.
00:57:39.790 - 00:58:09.066, Speaker G: They are not exposed to the bridge and Ux at all. And then it might take a bit longer for the bridged funds to arrive. So let's say on the order of, like, two minutes to go from optimism to arbitrum. And then after that, they can just trade normally as if it was like a centralized exchange. And then in a super ideal world, it would be like almost a cross chain wallet, so they could log in on the same wallet on arbitrage, withdraw their funds, or something like that.
00:58:09.168 - 00:58:33.310, Speaker D: Okay, interesting. Yeah, I'm definitely excited to see how you guys progress on the cross chain strategy. I feel like there's a lot of opportunity across various chains, so I feel like that's an important piece. But I did want to ask, too, about the liquidation engine and just kind of the risk engine in general. How does that work under the hood? Because ultimately that's going to be pretty important, considering the leverage involved and some of the synthetic leverage that's enabled on vertex.
00:58:33.390 - 00:59:14.926, Speaker G: Every single asset sort of has a weight, I guess, and then the weight is sort of just like a penalty on its value. So we have a concept of how much health your account has, and then we just add up the value of all of your assets, and then depending on the risk of that asset, the values decremented a bit to count for your health, and then if your health drops below zero, you get liquidated. And then we try our best to do a good job when it comes to not listing assets that are particularly risky for the exchange.
00:59:15.118 - 00:59:25.554, Speaker B: And so what would those health factors kind of look like maybe something comparing like ETH to something like MKR, which you've recently added.
00:59:25.602 - 00:59:39.274, Speaker G: USDC would be one, right? Because USDC is just one USDC. That's the base asset that we use. And then BTC is like zero point 95, and then you can say what.
00:59:39.312 - 01:00:31.398, Speaker A: MKR is, it's 0.9. So converting it back into leverage, you can get up to 20 to one leverage on BTC perps, and you can get ten to one leverage on maker perps. So if you look across the space, we are on the conservative end, I would say, as far as leverage goes, and then we have slightly more conservative leverage ratios with the collateral assets. So if you're doing spot, you get less leverage, because obviously that becomes the underlying thing. That's like underpinning the portfolio, the perf. We can just kind of liquidate one user into another, but with the spot assets, you want to be a bit more conservative in terms of what people are holding and what actually sits in the system, because that's what kind of underpins the whole credit structure of the exchange.
01:00:31.494 - 01:00:36.300, Speaker D: And if I wanted to take part in liquidations, how exactly would I do that?
01:00:37.790 - 01:00:57.954, Speaker G: You would have to spin up your own liquidation bot. I think we have our own liquidator. We've definitely shared it with people, but I'm not sure if it's like a public repository just yet, to be honest. You have to be somewhat technical to do it right now.
01:00:58.072 - 01:01:15.286, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like that's pretty standard across the space. Honestly, you need a little bit of technical expertise to do that. How is the risk engine fared so far? I know you put out a good thread, Alwin. On the day XRP news got released and it went up like 70% or so. So it'd be great to hear a little bit more on that end.
01:01:15.468 - 01:01:18.010, Speaker G: Oh, thanks. I didn't know you followed me on Twitter.
01:01:18.510 - 01:01:19.820, Speaker D: Yeah, of course.
01:01:23.070 - 01:02:14.362, Speaker G: It's been going pretty good. I don't think we've had a single day where the insurance fund has gotten drawn down. So we have this summary bot, which just tells me the status of everything. So the insurance fund is up like $15,000 since inception, and then the liquidator that we run is up like $16,000 since inception. So really, over the course of all of these various ups and downs, liquidators made money. The insurance fund made money. The way our system is set up is like we just run our own instance of the matching engine, like a separate standoff instance that is maybe like 50 milliseconds behind the matching engine.
01:02:14.362 - 01:02:29.790, Speaker G: And then that's just constantly looking for accounts that can be liquidated. So when the price moves, it might be like we should liquidate most accounts within a few seconds, tops. So it's pretty robust.
01:02:31.590 - 01:02:38.740, Speaker B: And you mentioned the insurance fund. There is like a portion of trading fees used to fund that account.
01:02:41.590 - 01:03:18.750, Speaker G: So the way we do liquidations is say you're underwater and you have some bitcoin, you're long a bunch of bitcoin. So when I try to liquidate that bitcoin, it just means that I buy that bitcoin from you and I give you some USDC. And the price that I buy the bitcoin from you at is computed using the oracle price of bitcoin, and I get like a slight discount. And that's what incentivizes me to liquidate you. And a part of that gap between the Oracle price and the price that's computed, like the liquidation price, is sent to the insurance fund.
01:03:18.820 - 01:03:23.380, Speaker D: And at what point would this insurance fund be tapped into? What is its use for?
01:03:23.910 - 01:04:10.480, Speaker G: So sometimes when an account goes underwater or something, some of the funds from insurance will be used to top up that account. I think that there have been cases where accounts did go underwater during the XRP stuff. So some money went from the insurance fund into those accounts. Once I've completely finished liquidating you, I've bought all of your assets and I've paid off all your liabilities, and then it turns out that you still have one liability, like negative 500 USDC and nothing else. In that case, 500 USDC will come out of the insurance fund to reset your account.
01:04:13.190 - 01:04:24.502, Speaker D: Okay. And if the insurance fund can't make up that difference, is it amortized across the holders of the same asset within that account that has a negative balance, yes.
01:04:24.556 - 01:04:44.042, Speaker G: So if your liability is like, let's say negative five BTC spot, then it's amortized across all holders or all depositors of that spot token. If it's like a perp position and you're down bad, then it's amortized across participants in that perp market.
01:04:44.176 - 01:04:59.050, Speaker B: Okay, got you there. And earlier you mentioned some similarities with the mango markets that was built on Solana. So I'm curious. That obviously suffered a pretty bad exploit or attack, whatever you want to call it. How is that avoidable on Vertex?
01:04:59.130 - 01:05:18.582, Speaker G: I don't think that hack was a function of a shitty model. I think that hack was like a function of shitty parameters within that model. So, yeah, we're not going to list VRTX and have an unreasonable amount of leverage that you can take on it.
01:05:18.636 - 01:06:18.966, Speaker A: If you look at all the assets we've listed so far, we've kind of focused on doing things that have pretty decent depth and liquidity to them, well established products. At the same time, we obviously look at that and we have a whole list of things that we implement, or we discuss risk, or Alan and I might game various scenarios and say, okay, how can we guard against this in the future? It's just a constantly evolving thing. I don't think our risk framework will ever be finished. But as Alwin said in the first instance, not listing your own illiquid exchange token on a fairly high collateral value, probably a good risk then. You know, there's a lot of wrong way risk there with that token being on the exchange and leveraged and uses collateral. But there's a ton of other things we can do and look at we'll.
01:06:18.998 - 01:07:11.254, Speaker G: Implement over time separately. Hacks are actually one of the places where this off chain sequencer actually benefits us a lot, right? So what happens is in our sequencer, if we see massive withdrawals and stuff, we know of that shit beforehand and we have the timeout, like the slow mode timeout to actually respond. So if we see a withdrawal come through for $100 million, that is going to get flagged. That's pretty strange. And it's sort of like the guy can try and push through that withdrawal, but we kind of have like 3 hours to figure out what exactly is going on. So we just have an additional delay where we can be pretty responsive. It's not like one blockchain transaction.
01:07:11.254 - 01:07:12.054, Speaker G: You just get fucked.
01:07:12.102 - 01:07:38.082, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, I think. Probably not. Listing your illiquid native token with high leverage is probably a good move. But I did want to ask too. So I feel like DyDX kind of got big and a lot of traction because they were kind of like the first perps decks that did like a really big airdrop that ended up well for its users. And then if you look at GMX, the fees are super high. But people love that token because the yield is so good.
01:07:38.082 - 01:08:07.430, Speaker D: Paid out in eth and escrow. GMX because of the high fees. I was looking at it the other day, it's like on every $10,000 of volume on GMX you're paying like $20 of fees, and on vertex you're paying like two. So it's ten times cheaper to trade on vertex. But I guess I'm just wondering for you guys, you're not the first, and you're also not going to be generating the most revenue until you reach scale. So I guess what is the strategy for, I guess bootstrapping, staying power in a moat.
01:08:07.590 - 01:08:48.234, Speaker A: I think the roadmap is we're still in version 0.50.6, if you like, of our product offering. We launched three months ago. We don't have a liquid token, we have an incentive program. We've been very clear about our airdrop strategy, so our airdrop will be incredibly generous, but it's based on trading activity. So if you're a user, you come to vertex, you trade, you're helping us build a product, and we reward you with our exchange token for your trouble. Now, I don't think the whole community picked up on quite how generous our token program is.
01:08:48.234 - 01:09:31.670, Speaker A: So we're airdropping like 9% of tokens in October. There's some bells and whistles around how that airdrop will occur, which will become public in due course. But the truth is, by the end of that airdrop, we'll have a liquid token. So people will now be able to put price on what the incentives are worth. We'll have, I think, one of the best products out there, if you look at, goes through from speed, convenience, which obviously like Alwin and the back team have built out. So it's really fast, it's super capital efficient. You can do spot, you can do pervs all in one place, and then on the front end.
01:09:31.670 - 01:10:22.642, Speaker A: We've really worked hard to make the UI UX super accessible, easy to understand, and we just continue to smash away at that. So it sounds really boring, but the strategy is to have a really fucking good product that works really well and will give you tokens and build community while we do it. And I think people will respect that. A lot of crypto is just have a ton of bullshit marketing and then put a product out and the product just underwhelms. We decided to focus on having a really good product first and then just let word of mouth do the rest. So we're still in that process. It's starting to build like you found us, I think, through word of mouth.
01:10:22.642 - 01:10:36.614, Speaker A: Other people have come to us through word of mouth. There's way more value in that. I think you get recommended by people you believe in, who like our product, than there is in just paying for a ton of people to shill your shit on Twitter.
01:10:36.742 - 01:11:07.266, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a sobering take. I like it. Build the product, get iteration, then give people a token. It's refreshing to hear that. You did talk about the VRTX like Token Airdrop and token incentive program. Can you guys shed any light on, I guess, the tokenomic design? Like what will the token be used for exactly? I'm curious how you guys arrived at the 28% allocation for the team and early investors. That just seems pretty generous in terms of, I guess, industry standards.
01:11:07.266 - 01:11:09.560, Speaker D: Normally it's closer to 50% or so.
01:11:10.250 - 01:12:32.530, Speaker A: Yeah, so I mean, addressing that part, I think ultimately it kind of depends on the size of the team, the resources have been put into it. We raised a decent amount of capital last year from investors, and as you alluded to early in the podcast, we started off in Terra, we went through all of the Terra DPEG, we went through all of the events around FTX last year, other centralized exchanges, blockchains having problems, protocols going to shit, getting hacked. And through all of that, our investors have been very supportive, calm, helped us move forward, helped connect us to people, and the team has done the same. And frankly, in the midst of all that, to build a great product, and I think today we're like top three for volume on perp taxes, I think is a highly justifiable amount. You look at what's going to the community and how we're looking to spread it, I think it makes sense. So I feel no need to justify that, really. I think it's kind of fully warranted in terms of the tokenomics.
01:12:32.530 - 01:13:34.406, Speaker A: It's a governance token, so it will have some voting power, given the technical sort of basis of the exchange. Obviously a lot of that will probably be on a recommended basis only. It's not going to be totally enforceable, because it's just inappropriate for a community to decide on, say, risk metrics for an exchange or anything else. So we have to think carefully about how that gets handled. But then on the economic side, say the plan is to put elements of their exchange revenue back into their token. So haven't quite fixed the percentage yet, but basically there'll be like a USDC payment weekly into token staking, and that will be users be incentivized to stake and partake in governance and receive some dollars.
01:13:34.508 - 01:14:12.426, Speaker D: I also noticed in the docs, it said that it could potentially be used to pay for baskets of assets that are acquired via liquidation, and then the subsequent VRTX payment would be burned potentially. I also saw another burn mechanism that is like if incentives go above $10 million in a given month, then the excess is burned as well. And I also saw potentially paying for trading fees and VRTX, with VRTX getting burned as well, is that still where your head is at in terms of token design or is what you guys laid out more so just general ideas for now? Because the token is obviously not live.
01:14:12.548 - 01:14:54.510, Speaker A: I think it was more like a general idea space. I think as things have evolved, I think my head's come to a place where working back, paying for fees, it's a little bit circular because we get paid in USDC. The USDC goes to stakers. People buy the token to then earn the staking yield. It's a similar way around to paying in the fee, you know what I mean? It just complicates the mechanism while achieving the same thing. So I'm not sure asking Alwin and the back end team to make that work has that much value. Similar thing with the baskets.
01:14:54.510 - 01:15:43.120, Speaker A: What was the second thing in terms of capping the amount of tokens issued? That is something I think we will seriously look at. It might not be in place in the first instance, but if we see that we're doing volumes such that that becomes a huge excessive amount of token we're issuing every month, we'll probably put a mechanism in place to control for it. I think the lesson learned from DyDX was those incentives were really insane at one point. And so there are probably ways we can make that better and benefit token holders other than just issuing like $50 million of incentives in a month.
01:15:44.130 - 01:15:58.420, Speaker B: How do you think about the dynamics of incentivizing both traders and market makers in this model? Right, because you kind of need both to make this ecosystem run. So how do you think about the balance that you need to have at play here?
01:15:59.030 - 01:16:56.760, Speaker A: Yeah, obviously it's like any market, you need to have a supply and you need to have demand. If you don't have market makers, you don't have a market. And if you don't have price takers, you don't have someone to help arbitrage, push the price around, do various things right, just take risk and add value by crossing bid offer. I think more simply, you can think of the token as a way of denoting membership of the exchange. So if you look at an old exchange like CME or the SiBO or CBOT, right back in the day, not as they are now, but back in the day, they would have seats on the board. So if you were a trading firm at the CME, you'd have an exchange membership. And that exchange membership would give you certain benefits.
01:16:56.760 - 01:17:49.814, Speaker A: Yes, you'd get some proportion of the exchange's revenues, but you'd also get the ability to participate in exchange decision making, what products were going to get listed, how risk was managed, whether other firms were let in, what would happen, all these sorts of things, right? With our token, we can create a similar thing. And like all exchanges, members will conduct different activities. So, yes, market makers are huge, and they get like a special designation because they supply the liquidity. But then you got all these participants who come in and are trading professionally. Or in the case of crypto, a lot of these are going to be retail, right? They come in and trade and do things. Maybe they're doing a cash and carry trade. They're trying to capture spot per basis, or they're just doing a pairs trade or whatever it is.
01:17:49.814 - 01:18:22.658, Speaker A: They might just be taking direction because they think doge is going to the moon and they're going to go ten x leverage and see it go up. Whatever it is, doesn't matter. All those guys add value and in return they get the token. So it's just a way of increasing the expected value of trading on vertex. Right now, it's extremely positive ev to come and trade with us. Every trade you do, even if you marginally lose money from a fee basis, you should be making cash trading with vertex. We want you to make money.
01:18:22.744 - 01:19:09.470, Speaker B: Super interesting. And if you think about an original spot Dex, like, say, on Ethereum, for example, trading was never what was incentivized. It was always the LP side. So getting that liquidity in because there was sort of a necessity for traders to have to come to the protocol and trade anyways. If you think about the perp landscape that we've seen, that be much different. We've seen a lot of perp dexes use incentive programs to get traders in the door, and then the idea is just building a badass product that they stay for. But does that logic still translate here? Will market makers kind of always need to be incentivized, or can you build a system to which that they're going to be making money as well and such, that that's what keeps them coming forever? Not necessarily the fact that they're getting additional incentives.
01:19:11.730 - 01:19:54.762, Speaker G: I feel like the main distinction between spot and perp is that perp mostly happens on order books and spot still happens mostly on amms, on chain. So on order books, it just doesn't really make sense for people to throw money into a giant pile and to incentivize that in terms of vertex or whatever, it's like zero fucking effort for them to just keep it on and to keep providing liquidity. And if they're good at market making, they should just continue making money. So why turn off something that's making money? So that's just the general idea. Hopefully the market makers stay after incentives because they've already paid the fixed cost to get connected.
01:19:54.826 - 01:20:04.082, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense actually. Plus the maker rebates and zero maker fees definitely doesn't hurt. Who are some of your market maker mean?
01:20:04.136 - 01:20:43.294, Speaker A: I think it's well known that winter mute were participating in our ecosystem. We had a strategic round with them. They put small investment in and our market making with us. But then if you look at our round last year, it's hard for me to give all the names that market make with us. So I'll tell you who invested with us, our investors included like Dexterity, JST, Hudson River, Jane Street, GSR. So not all of those are market making with us, but some of them are. And we have a bunch of other firms that are market making as well.
01:20:43.294 - 01:21:22.780, Speaker A: I think what's interesting is depending on the market, we have more market makers that participate in BTC and east, and slightly fewer that do the alt markets, which sort of mirrors most exchanges. We're starting to see market makers come now. They've seen our volumes on various stats and stuff, and people are seeing us competing. We're now seeing other market makers join in. So we started with about five market makers that's growing. I think there are ten that are active across different products at the moment.
01:21:25.070 - 01:21:55.810, Speaker D: Okay, and now the end goal for Vertex, it feels like to me at least, and correct me if I'm wrong, but is ultimately to complete with centralized exchanges. You guys aren't necessarily decentralization maxis, but you're more so product maxis. You just want to enable a really good trading experience. You get on a centralized exchange with the added benefit of self custody and a little bit more decentralization than you'd get on a sex and maybe avoiding implosions of FTX. So I guess what features do you want to launch over the next twelve months that help you achieve that goal?
01:21:55.970 - 01:22:59.414, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in terms of pure product, huge one is cross chain, which we already sort of spoke about. I think figuring out wallet Ux would be really important. I think just the pure nature of having a noncustodial wallet puts a lot of users off. So probably need to engage with using account abstraction on some level to create say like a Vertex smart account where people can just log in with their email, have an account, and it just feels like logging into any web two company, but in the background you own your wallet and you know that those assets are segregated away from the rest of the exchange. I think probably we need to look at a few little feature things like isolated margin. Even though I kind of personally think it's dumb, some users want to use it, so you got to give the people what they want. Can you think of anything else?
01:22:59.452 - 01:23:00.126, Speaker E: Alwan?
01:23:00.258 - 01:23:01.530, Speaker A: What am I missing?
01:23:04.110 - 01:23:06.380, Speaker G: Yeah, I would say those are the main things.
01:23:08.350 - 01:23:47.766, Speaker A: Oh, I think it would be interesting to think about how does one really, how do you really neatly integrate like a fiat on ramp and off ramp? That's probably like one of the big things that people use centralized exchanges for. And I think until you have that on vertex, you're always going to have some element of friction. You got to go somewhere else to get your crypto before you can then trade on vertex. That's very suboptimal. We really want to own the user from start to end, so how do you put that into our package? So these are the sort of things we think about.
01:23:47.948 - 01:24:07.354, Speaker B: That's awesome, guys. I really love that analysis there in general, your approach of kind of figuring out what are the tradeoffs that we need today to make a product great in crypto. So thanks a lot for joining us today. This was an exciting conversation. Can you just give us some thoughts on where to find you or where to find more about the protocol?
01:24:07.402 - 01:24:19.666, Speaker A: Vertex best place to find me is on Twitter at Darius to buy T-A-P-A-I-I recommend following Alan. He is excellent when he chooses to put something out.
01:24:19.768 - 01:24:21.346, Speaker G: My first name and my last name.
01:24:21.448 - 01:24:43.450, Speaker A: Just pure at Alwin Peng and then at Vertex underscore protocol. So yeah, you can follow us there or join the discord. And if you've got any questions, we pride ourselves on having pretty decent user support, so there's a good team working on discord to help with any problems and just come and use the product. Awesome.
01:24:43.520 - 01:24:51.098, Speaker D: Sounds great, man. We'll be sure to link to Vertex as well in the show notes and in the project docs as well. So thanks again for coming on, guys.
01:24:51.184 - 01:24:52.360, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Thanks for having us.
