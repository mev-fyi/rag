00:00:00.280 - 00:00:46.860, Speaker A: I think that this notion that there should be tens or hundreds or thousands of liquid staking tokens for the same asset is exactly the opposite of what a liquid staking asset is supposed to be. The only job of a liquid staking token is to be liquid, and the best liquid staking token will be as liquid as the underlying. When you create all different types or many, many different liquid staking tokens for the same asset, you add slippage and bigger spreads to all those trading pairs. And for that reason, this market will not scale to be anything beyond like airdrop farmers. In my view.
00:00:50.040 - 00:01:20.126, Speaker B: Nothing said on Xerox Research is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. Podcast is for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our opinions, not financial advice. Boccaccio, Ryan and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects discussed. What's up, guys? Welcome back to another episode of Xerox Research. Today I'm joined by Danny, Luke, and Ryan to talk about all that's happening in crypto and across the markets. Today's a great day. Bitcoin's up 3.5%.
00:01:20.126 - 00:01:49.590, Speaker B: Bitcoin related stocks are up double digits. Coinbase is up 11%. Microstrategy is up 14%, and mining stocks are also up clean sparks up nine and a half percent. The big catalyst is likely the fact that of what happened over the weekend with us politics. I don't want to dive too deep into it, but I think it's probably best to get Ryan's views on what's happening.
00:01:51.090 - 00:02:45.788, Speaker A: Yes, so events over the weekend, super tragic. But what's on everyone in Crypto's mind right now is like, there are obviously implications for crypto markets and crypto policy going forward. Look, Donna, the Republicans most recently positioned themselves as like the pro crypto party from the Trump campaigns, directly from the Trump campaign. They've called the crackdown on crypto markets un american. They recently stated that they opposed the creation of a central bank digital currency. They recently stated that they support the right to mine bitcoin and ensure every american's right to self custody. And given the events again over the weekend, we saw what happened in polymarket.
00:02:45.788 - 00:03:43.310, Speaker A: With the polls, the probability that Trump takes this election rose above 70% briefly, and I think sit around 70% as of this recording. So crypto is ripping, and understandably so. What's on everyone's mind in crypto markets is like, what happens next? We have a bullish crypto policy regime. Some things that are undermined are obviously staking subsequent ETF's like potentially a sole ETF and then changing participants in the market. If this is a more crypto friendly regime, institutions are going to feel much more comfortable in the space. And how does that change the game that we're playing in terms of the prevalence of narrative trading or technical analysis? These are things that everyone's thinking through right now and next twelve months in regards to crypto policy are going to be, I think, pretty interesting.
00:03:45.650 - 00:04:09.900, Speaker B: One thing that I was thinking about is the ETF swing, but Solana is one. What do you think is the next one? Do you think they'll go like Litecoin, XRP, the old guard? Or do you think they'll do something very relevant to real world assets link? I guess like big enough to be relevant, but also like real world Asset? Or do you think they'll do like actually good crypto stuff?
00:04:11.520 - 00:05:04.670, Speaker A: I think you're right to say that the obvious next asset is Solana. I think that the problem with like list, like the obvious problem here is just like single asset ETF's are not incredibly popular. These are pretty illiquid markets to begin with. So like, you know, as we keep going down the risk curve on approvals, you have to think that these exposures are going to get bundled. It's probably, and like, this is not a sub three month thing, but I don't know, over the next twelve to 18, as investors get more comfortable with the space, there's a very obvious case for a spy like product. You're not going to have 500 assets in it. But Bitwise's top ten by market cap product seems like an obvious next step here.
00:05:04.670 - 00:05:27.230, Speaker A: No one wants to own the avax Etf. You want to bundle that because it's not an obvious exposure. Bitcoin is an obvious thing. It is the industry's beta asset. If you want beta exposure to crypto, you buy that thing. Beyond that, you're looking for diversified exposure and you're going to want to have a portfolio of these assets and not just exposure to a single one.
00:05:27.570 - 00:06:07.518, Speaker C: I think it's a great point. I think if you look at Grayscale and some of the offerings that they have today, then trusts, they have altcoin combined offerings, they've got defi coin combined offerings. I think what Ryan's getting at makes a ton of sense. I wouldn't be surprised. I think what these guys will be thinking about next after the biggest ones are out of the way are what are those meaningful categories maybe, or groupings or buckets of assets to put together that would be interested in looking at next. So it could be alternative blockchains outside of ethereum or maybe outside Sol. If Sol gets its own ETF as well, maybe meme coins.
00:06:07.518 - 00:06:16.570, Speaker C: Doge is still a very large asset and you can look at the chart and see the performance over time. There's different opportunities like that.
00:06:17.470 - 00:06:48.300, Speaker B: They had a meme coin index launch. Um, I can't remember who launched it, but one, I feel like a pretty obvious one. A staked Ethan staked soul. But I'm wondering if they'll just convert existing ones into staked ones. I don't know anything about how the regulation behind that would work or if they would launch new ones. Because as far as I remember, when we said, like, ethan's going to launch a ETF, everyone was convinced that it would be immediately stakeable. That's obviously not the case so far.
00:06:48.300 - 00:07:28.872, Speaker B: Like, there's nothing that's been said that would imply that. So I'm wondering if they'll end up launching stake thief and staked soul ones. And this is one thing that I talked with the Lido people, Lido people with Haso and vasily, and they were very clearly, like, I think they also know that Coinbase has the lead there with staking, institutional staking. And it's not Lido, unfortunately. Like, even though I would have preferred it if it was like a decentralized operation operator, that would potentially also be something good for coin. If we do go for stake thief, it's kind of semi of a tangent. Yeah.
00:07:29.016 - 00:07:48.830, Speaker A: The problem on that is just like the timeframe with, like, they're in court on that right now. Right? I don't know. That's going to take twelve to 24 months to kind of solve. Probably closer to twelve, I'm guessing. And Gensler's term is up in June of 2026. So staking, I don't know, it seems like a little far out there right now.
00:07:49.210 - 00:08:12.042, Speaker C: Yeah. The regulatory sort of issue with staking seems like it's kind of been a thorn there for the many businesses who have been sued now for having those types of products or been asked to change wordings and disclosures and how those business models work. So, like, to Ryan's point, I wouldn't be surprised if those take longer, particularly.
00:08:12.066 - 00:09:08.242, Speaker D: With the recent allegations naming Lido's staked ETH potentially as a security. I think the idea of having a decentralized node operator set providing the liquid staking instrument is probably too far out in the future from an immediate sense. I would agree with Ryan that Solana is the most likely next candidate for the ETF product. That being said, I think it's almost too far out in the future for it to be particularly important at this point in time. I almost think that in rate of change terms, given that ETH is, we're looking at Ethereum. ETF begins trading by July 26, up to a 94% probability on polymarket. In rate of change terms, Ethereum is going to be the next asset that gets the big bid from traditional finance pockets.
00:09:08.242 - 00:09:19.390, Speaker D: I think almost past six months, that narrative has been discounted too heavily and we're almost thinking too far out into the future about the next thing to get approved.
00:09:20.850 - 00:09:25.130, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. That's kind of a crypto thing. That's like something happened. What's next?
00:09:25.250 - 00:10:02.610, Speaker C: When is going to trade the next narrative? I guess if you look at the timelines, even, right, like the bitcoin applications started getting discussed last year, probably around this time, maybe may or June, if I remember correctly. And obviously that did not go live until the beginning of this year. And we're seeing a similar sort of multi month timeframe from applications to potential trading going live for ETH as well. So even if you are thinking about the next one being solana, it's like you need to at least put, you know, maybe six months on top of, you know, time following, you know, new applications going in to any trading going live in the future.
00:10:03.350 - 00:10:27.830, Speaker B: Yeah, that's fair. A couple other big news dropped over the weekend. I think the biggest one is the Makerdao fund. No, not a fund. A billion dollar competition to invest in tokenized treasuries. Apparently Blackrock's biddle build, ondo finance and super state are applying for it. I am.
00:10:27.830 - 00:10:57.680, Speaker B: This is like, Makerdao is one of those, I think, assets that everybody, like all of the funds are invested in at this point, just because it was one of the few DeFi assets that they could get into. So, like, one thing that David from the block works research team brought up was that who is the extra buyer over here? And I honestly don't really know. I feel like who is buying maker? Everybody already, like all big funds already have maker.
00:10:59.020 - 00:11:31.470, Speaker C: It's a good question, but I think the interesting part about Maker itself is it's got classic sort of business fundamentals that people can look at and price and bid upon. It's kind of carved out its own sort of space within the industry that you're not just taking a gamble on the future success of something you can take a look at their revenue statement today and decide if you want to own it. If you think that this sort of decentralized business makes sense going into the future.
00:11:31.970 - 00:11:47.226, Speaker B: Yeah. It's one of the few protocols that you can actually run legitimate p and ls and stuff on. Like, it actually fits it and not. You're making stuff up. Um, I don't know. We'll see. I.
00:11:47.226 - 00:11:58.466, Speaker B: I really like, like they were doing. So, to be honest with you, I'm not sure, like, how sexy of a asset it is, especially given that DeFi 1.0 isn't particularly popular at this point.
00:11:58.538 - 00:12:42.408, Speaker C: I think despite the fundamentals, like, if you just look at the maker Eth chart, it, it hasn't really returned anything beyond what just holding ETh would have returned. So it's, you know, I think there's a fundamental question there of can they build a business that is more meaningful to people than just the Ethereum model is? Or are people still, like, sort of closely tying, you know, the success of something like maker to just the success of something like Eth? I think that's sort of a fundamental question. I think, you know, a lot of projects probably struggle from that same question. Right. If Solana were to, you know, fail as a business per se, you know, a lot of the things built on top, I think you'd have similar worries about their future success, too.
00:12:42.584 - 00:12:53.200, Speaker B: Yeah, but I. Yeah, like, Jira would be dead, obviously, because it's all like, purely a salon infrastructure play. I'm not sure what else. I guess, like, drift and stuff could.
00:12:53.240 - 00:13:29.140, Speaker A: Move aptos, but, like, maker's not that exciting of a business. Right. I mean, what are the products that they have? It's mostly lending and real world assets. Like, I understand that there is a, there's a fundamental tailwind to want to use these services, but, like, I don't know, how does it stand up next to an aAve? It's trading at, I don't know, what, ten times sales given, like, tradfi comps. Like, that's not, that's not cheap.
00:13:29.840 - 00:13:30.440, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:30.560 - 00:14:29.620, Speaker D: In the course of the bear, we've seen a lot of the DAI supply backing become increasingly collateralized by both USDC and then also treasury bills and off chain loans, which, of course, has been the largest driver of increase in revenue for the maker protocol. So simultaneously we have this, this outlook where interest rates might fall, where that revenue to the Dow would fall along with that interest rate exposure. But then concurrently, there's this narrative where when that happens, there should be increased demand for leverage against crypto native spot assets like Ethereum and staked Ethereum. But we really haven't seen that demand for leverage come back over the course of the past year and the recent bull move where Maker TVL and the dye supply has effectively flatlined and really has underperformed the recent recovery and spot assets.
00:14:31.000 - 00:14:39.540, Speaker B: How have other leverage tools been doing like Aave and stuff? Because that's their business now. Same with Morpho.
00:14:40.200 - 00:14:53.560, Speaker D: So Aave has flippant maker in terms of borrows and aaves now the largest money market. I believe they have seven to 8 billion in total borrows outstanding right now.
00:14:54.620 - 00:14:59.468, Speaker B: They're almost back at all time highs. That's kind of crazy. Well, not really, but yeah.
00:14:59.484 - 00:15:15.220, Speaker C: I mean, the question is still who wants to own the token? I think is still really the question. I don't know. Despite their kind of flipping of maker, I think just looking at the chart, it really hasn't done anything appreciable.
00:15:17.120 - 00:15:17.408, Speaker B: In.
00:15:17.424 - 00:15:51.470, Speaker C: The past, this cycle, really, I guess the past year and a half. And I don't know if that's because they're not driving enough fundamental value back to the token itself, if it's really just like there's a great operating model going on, but there isn't enough reason to own the token today. I think a lot of projects struggle from that. I think regulatory concerns limit a lot of potential sort of setups, designs around tokens today. So that could be part of it. But I guess I'm not as deep in the weeds. I don't know, Luke, if you think there's anything specific there.
00:15:52.210 - 00:16:31.010, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there's a non zero probability that regulatory headwinds could be some risk to really any DAO governance token maker Aave included, where there are allegations of a security or an unregistered securities offering. That being said, it's ultimately for the SEC to make that allegation and then for it to be settled in court. And we really haven't seen that risk come into play for these multibillion dollar tokens. That being said, market participants do need to have some discount rate on that risk.
00:16:33.390 - 00:17:35.920, Speaker B: I know we shat on narrative trading last time, but I wonder if, like tokenization defi, like if Larry fangs going on tv, tv and saying, oh, like tokenization and decentralized finance, these things actually work and they're like relevant then. I mean, these are, I guess they're not like the best businesses, but they are the best that we have to offer to market participants. So I wonder if they could ever perform just off the back of that, because like, yeah, I guess they can't ever really, or at least not ever, but for the foreseeable future implement some form of value accrual. But Makerdao had a burn, has a burn buyback and burn model. I don't think Aave doesn't have anything. So maybe if they implement, I mean, I'm sure that like, that's the thing. If like Trump and the Republicans win and they can do whatever they want with crypto, I think that's like the number one step for, I guess, all the old guard to implement some form of fee switch.
00:17:35.920 - 00:18:01.480, Speaker B: Like, we've seen uniswap attempt it maybe like seven times over the past year. Lido had a couple of posts, but they were fake. But there's obviously people thinking about it within the community. Like, all of them are thinking about it. So I wonder if that ever like, becomes a legitimate thing and we're not just trading governance tokens, but we're actually trading, I guess, tokenized equity.
00:18:02.190 - 00:18:48.020, Speaker D: I think the biggest catalyst, at least for a token value accrual perspective for both Maker and Aave are the currently discussed roadmap plans of transitioning these Ethereum l one applications to their own blockchains. Aave has discussed the idea of making Aave token the staking asset for their own network. Can't help but imagine that maker might do something similar. And under that context where you both eliminate all of these fees that need to get paid to the l one main net, I think the tokens could see much more of an infrastructure like multiple compared to the application multiple they might have right now.
00:18:48.360 - 00:19:27.094, Speaker B: I don't think it makes any sense for lending protocols to have their own app chains. I think it makes sense for some products, but not for like Aave. At the end of the day, if I'm using Aave on ethereum, I'm using it because it's on ethereum and not on like some random l one or random l two. Like I want the etherium safety. I want the what? Like, you can't just do random stuff. I'm not at the whim of a sequencer or some random like node operator, it's like it's ethereum. So I'm not sure I get the multiple, and I'm sure that also dies down the way that the l two multiple died down over like six months, but I'm sure they'll try.
00:19:27.094 - 00:19:36.790, Speaker B: But to me it just doesn't make that much sense. Perp Dex is sure launch as many l one s as you want. Launch an l two, I don't care. But not like for lending, not for core defi.
00:19:36.830 - 00:19:50.920, Speaker C: I think I'll make just a quick point. Is that even a fair point, considering all eth activity is going to l two s today? I mean, just look at base, it's expanding like crazy and eth activity has been down only.
00:19:51.580 - 00:20:21.140, Speaker D: So I will say we see like transactional activity across l two s flipping ethereum l one main net. That being said, we still have probably like ten applications on Ethereum mainnet that all individually have more tvl than the top l one. So while we see like transactional activity, picking up the migration of deposits really hasn't manifested.
00:20:21.880 - 00:20:35.660, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like most big money will stay on eth for the foreseeable future. And not like even if l two s have like some form of exit hatch, I don't know, why risk it? Why not just stay on ethereum?
00:20:36.850 - 00:20:59.030, Speaker C: Does this maybe partially explain why ZK tech could be such a positive catalyst for growth of those types of chains? If you don't have to trust anymore, your money is safe because of math, would that be reason enough for this really sticky eth Tvl to move off to a Zk environment?
00:20:59.690 - 00:21:41.176, Speaker B: I think it's more about trusting over a certain period of time. Um, I think it just comes from the fact that it has worked for x amount of like, there's still a reason why people are parking their money in Aave over Morpho. Like, I'm sure the morpho team has done really well and their smart contracts are all safe and everything's all good. But like Aave hasn't had knock on wood hasn't had an issue for quite some time. And when they do have issues, they mitigate them quite quickly. So it's like relatively trust where v it's been battle tested versus. So I think that's really like ZK will be great if it works at the scale that people want it to work, but I feel like there will always be some form of trust element to theory.
00:21:41.176 - 00:21:55.340, Speaker B: Like at the end of the day, if you can afford the gas, and you can afford the gas because everything's being done on deltas now, why not just use a few? If you just want to park your money, earn whatever, all they offer is like 0.07% or something.
00:21:56.610 - 00:22:21.026, Speaker D: Yeah. To the extent you need to trust an l two or an interoperability protocol less and there's less risk associated with those trust assumptions like we had assumed there would be with ZK tech, as opposed to optimistic. I definitely expect that to facilitate more capital migration in the future once it hits production scale.
00:22:21.098 - 00:22:53.520, Speaker B: That is the one thing I think people also discount is that if you try and transfer money off of ethereum, like, to your exchange, it takes 15 minutes. With some l two s, it takes sub ten minutes. But with ZK, for some exchanges, it takes like a day, which to me doesn't make any sense, but it does with Zksync, for example. So it's like, that's also a thing. Even if these are adopted, it's. I don't want to wait a day to get my money out of it, the system, like, I want it out now. Sub ten minutes, maybe.
00:22:53.520 - 00:23:16.120, Speaker B: So that's also something that's going to be important, but we've kind of. We'll see how it all develops. Before we move on to more questions, let's have a quick work from Ifena, thanks to our fantastic sponsor, layer zero. What's up, guys? For this week's layer zero snippet, I'm joined by Seraphim, the head of growth at ifina. Thank you for joining us, Serafim.
00:23:16.560 - 00:23:18.500, Speaker E: Hey, guys. Good to be here.
00:23:19.240 - 00:23:24.940, Speaker B: Just to start us off, do you want to give a short introduction of Athena and what you guys have been focused on over the past few months?
00:23:25.920 - 00:23:50.710, Speaker E: Sure. Athena is a synthetic dollar protocol, which means we have a product called USDe and Susde, which gives you an APY, a reward based on the futures funding rate. Long story short, it's a dollar denominated protocol. And what we've been doing lately is a bunch of things. We have layer Zero, and I'm really excited to share with you.
00:23:53.250 - 00:23:57.230, Speaker B: Perfect. How does layer Zero fit into Athena, exactly?
00:23:58.410 - 00:24:19.340, Speaker E: Yes, we partner up with Layer Zero quite early on, from the moment that we launched the protocol. And they've allowed us to move USD and SUsde, or for users to be able to move it to multiple chains like arbitrarium, blast mantle, and a bunch of new ones coming pretty soon as well. So they've been a core part of our multi chain strategy.
00:24:20.600 - 00:24:24.860, Speaker B: Perfect. And do you guys have any exciting plans over the next six to twelve months?
00:24:26.200 - 00:25:10.990, Speaker E: Yeah, I like to think so. We're going to launch on a bunch of different chains powered by layer Zero, some chains that I'm really excited about. You can think of your fastest growing, best distribution chains out there. Not going to name names, but I figure it out. We're going to be listed as collateral, as we've announced, and Bybit and Bitget and a few other large centralized projects soon as well and generally we're building the Athena chain, which is also very exciting project, which is going to be a confluence of restaking of yield products of perps enabled through Athena, which gives a lot more utility to USD and the ether governance token. So I expect layer zero to be an integral part of that as well.
00:25:11.810 - 00:25:33.560, Speaker B: Perfect. That all sounds very exciting. Thank you for joining us. One, I guess, like ecosystem that did particularly well over the past week was hyper liquid. Everything on there seems to be doing very well, and I. It's kind of why I invited Luke on, because I want to hear his takes on why things have been going up and what's going to happen.
00:25:34.860 - 00:27:00.956, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'm no particular hyper liquid expert, but seeing some of the price action on some of these spot alt markets has definitely drawn my attention. So in recent weeks, the team announced permissionless listing for various spot markets. That being said, the team will still curate a short strict list of various spot tokens, primarily to name Hfun, which is the token related to hyper liquids telegram trading bot Jeff points and per. And looking at the price action on those four tickers, the pattern's very much consistently up and to the right, almost in a straight line. So I almost think that when you have this purpose built blockchain for a perps Dex, that's ultimately going to become more, and you have this strict list of various altcoins, or meme coins, however you want to classify them. A lot of speculative energy can get channeled and focused into these four siloed markets, whereas all that speculative energy on something like Solana has ended up getting diluted across 300,000 various tickers. So of course, hyperliquid has been running this points campaign.
00:27:00.956 - 00:27:52.940, Speaker D: There's much anticipation of there being a pretty big airdrop, and so there's this token. Jeff, the founder of Hyperliquid is Jeff is trading at $7.5 million market cap, and he's about to hand out big stimmy checks to all of his loyal users and fans of the platform. So looking at it right now, it seems like that list of four tokens is outperforming a lot of other names in, I guess, the meme coin asset class. And I think performance chasers will ultimately migrate over to the opportunities that are showing up on hyper liquid right now, particularly with the catalyst that we'll see probably a big airdrop and more stimulus native to the hyper liquid ecosystem.
00:27:54.080 - 00:28:39.210, Speaker B: Yeah, this is one of those interesting scenarios where the team is very much like you make sure to trade these assets, because if you trade perps on hyper liquid, the points you get are like one 10th of the points you get if you trade the spot markets, which is kind of ridiculous. So, like, their incentivizing volume, it's one of those apps that people are like, oh, this one's good. This airdrop is actually going to save me. Jeff didn't take any vc money. He's going to airdrop. 40% to the community probably won't, which would make sense. But, yeah, this is, like, where I think, like, a lot of people's attentions have been over the past few weeks, and now it's like, really hitting the timeline of everybody's like, wow, hyper liquid.
00:28:39.210 - 00:28:41.630, Speaker B: Look at all this. This is happening.
00:28:42.570 - 00:28:51.630, Speaker A: Is there any evidence that the decline in blast activity has migrated to hyper liquid? Are you guys seeing that in any charts?
00:28:51.930 - 00:29:01.530, Speaker B: I think it's likely what Luke said, solana activity went to hyper liquid. Makes more sense than blast went to hyper liquid, ma'am.
00:29:01.610 - 00:29:50.240, Speaker A: I'm certainly not seeing a decline in solana activity. They're, like, tapping 40% of all crypto market dex volume at this point. I think they reached 39% within the last seven days on a daily basis. So I'm really not seeing a decline in Solana activity for sure. I mean, I'm looking at hyperlink with TVL right now, and it's like almost a straight line up. I think maybe the more interesting question is about, like, how did hyper liquid get to this position? It's been like, like, obviously, like, I think the, like, constrained validator set is super important for, like, a good experience. But I feel like the empirically the most important factor in a dex gaining adoption, or a high performant one getting adoption is listings.
00:29:50.240 - 00:29:54.640, Speaker A: And hyper liquid seems to fit that mole. I'm wondering what you guys think about that.
00:29:55.020 - 00:30:43.754, Speaker B: This is something I talked about with. We'll link the podcast that I did with Jeff below as well. But I talked to him about this, and they've, like, they've actually done a really good job. I think it was them. And avoid all the pre market listing. The pre listing markets. And I mean, for a really long time, you just couldn't get, and you still can't long with size or short with size on some of the, like, I guess, less popular pairs, like, apart from BTC, e Solana, and maybe a few more, you can't really, like, put on serious size, but it is like a breath of fresh air compared to what I think a lot of people got really used to GMX, which had like six assets on it over the vessel, like, moving on to, I mean, there's always dy DX, but, like, they have their own UX issues now because they moved.
00:30:43.754 - 00:31:17.814, Speaker B: But, like, I think a lot of people were trading on Dexs on Arbitrum. Hyper liquid launched on Arbitrum, even though it's not on Arbitrum, if you bridge over for Arbitrum. So I think they got a lot of those GMX traders on the platform, and they have a lot more assets and GMX ever. That's why I think you're right. Like, their listings have been really, really good. Permissionless spot listings. I'm not sure how relevant it's going to be after the airdrop, but until the airdrop, it's, it's a closed system where they incentivize trading.
00:31:17.814 - 00:31:21.570, Speaker B: Like, let's play. There's nothing else to it.
00:31:21.950 - 00:31:48.400, Speaker C: Looking at, just looking at some TVL numbers and of some different derivatives protocols. Like you mentioned, GMX, I mean, it's down 40% in TVL in the past three months, four months. Looks like Dydx as well. They haven't really moved. So it doesn't really seem like there would have been much flow back and forth between DyDX, but definitely the GMX drop off might explain this change here.
00:31:48.820 - 00:32:46.502, Speaker B: Yeah, I think people should keep a lookout on, and there will be a lot of good ones and a lot of bad ones, but because hyper liquids its own l one, there's going to be a lot of applications launching on there as well. And there's like, some very clear and simple ones, like lending protocols and swapping. Obviously not, but, like, other yield protocols will launch on it. There'll be a bunch of vault systems and defi apps, and I'm curious how they're going to deal with that because now they have raid trade launching on there, so I'm not sure how that's going to do. They, they didn't launch for like three years. They were originally built on top of GMX, but we'll see. I think, like, that's a good thing to keep an eye out on as well after these, like, because at the end of the day, like, the spot tokens right now are Jeff points h fund is an actual, like, thing, but, and per, like, if you are kind of risk averse, there's going to be opportunity in other places as well.
00:32:46.616 - 00:33:13.030, Speaker C: To Ryan's other point, as well on it not being a Solana migration, I mean, you can look at the Jupiter perpetuals TvL as well. And it's also up only to the right, same goes for drift. They were sort of up only the beginning of this year and it's held steady. So it doesn't really seem like people are moving away from Solana. It might just be rotation out of other less interesting perpaps in the eth space.
00:33:13.670 - 00:33:22.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I checked its blast. Blast lost 32% volumes over the past week, so I think it might be them. Ryan was right, boccaccio was wrong.
00:33:23.430 - 00:33:53.480, Speaker A: So I guess, like, so drift is super interesting because it seems like activity is still picking up there post airdrop. I don't know if they have an incentive thing going on right now, but the first one's like always the biggest one that everyone wants. If this is mercenary capital that has migrated to hyper liquidity for in hopes of outsized airdrop opportunity, what does the opportunity look like long term for this platform? Or maybe how does the team go about making sure that this capital is sticky?
00:33:56.500 - 00:34:58.280, Speaker B: I think the hyper liquid platform is actually really, really good, and I think obviously a lot of it is mercenary, but I still think that it's probably less mercenary than other applications were because there are like, GMX was actually being used for some reason, and it was. It was a good experience, but you could only create six assets and it had, like, horror, horrific fees. Hyper liquids, like, smooth, it's quite good, and there's always going to be a market, albeit niche, for perp dexs. I think, like, especially with regulation, a lot of people can't trade on sexes, so I think, like, hyper liquids, definitely one of the best two out there. DydX is also quite good. I think Vertex is also doing relatively well, but it might be good to check out how their volumes have done post airdrop. I don't think Vertex was ever, like, as complemented as hyper liquid.
00:34:58.280 - 00:35:27.940, Speaker B: Washington, as hyper liquid is like, not what nobody was like, oh, vertex is the best trading experience ever, but people are actually, like, saying hyper liquid's the best perpetual Dex experience we've had ever. It's really good, to be honest with you. I like, it's the only one that I use, but I mean, these are all mercenary. It will leave, they'll have like a 30% drop off, but as opposed to the 80% they would have traditionally had.
00:35:28.600 - 00:36:10.570, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Boc makes some good points there. I mean, if they're actually building a great product, which it seems like they may be. I'm not a perp Dex expert myself, so I couldn't really tell you. But, you know, I've heard good things about the listings and other features there, so certainly you know, if they can kind of out compete the category. But obviously, there's always a big, big, big question when something is pre token, when it shifts to post token and we see activity fall off. So we can make guesses as to how much of that might stay. But ultimately there's probably just some percent that is straightforward mercenary capital that will not be enticed to stay because there will be something else to go farm in the space.
00:36:10.570 - 00:36:14.670, Speaker C: There's always something else that's pre token or has rewards.
00:36:15.090 - 00:37:28.160, Speaker D: Yeah, so the points, programs and air drop farming will always attract a lot of users to try out the product. And if the users like it, I'd expect them to stay post TGE. And certainly hearing people's feedback on the product, it seems like it's one of the best perpstexes in the industry. So I think a lot of perps Dex traders will stay on that platform. I also think it's interesting that the success of hyperliquid is also a testament to the success and the power of Cosmos based tech. Hyperliquid originally built off of tendermint consensus and forked their consensus algorithm to implement proprietary hyper BFT consensus, which Jeff advertises, can boast through put up to 200,000 orders per second per second, which is incredibly powerful bandwidth. So I think it goes to show that if you get some gigabrain developers to fork aspects of the Cosmos stack, you can actually implement some incredibly powerful products.
00:37:28.160 - 00:37:49.966, Speaker D: Of course, that ends up looking like success for the end application as opposed to success or TVL for Cosmos and the Cosmos Hub. So it's a very different outcome than what people might have thought success would look like for Cosmos. But from my perspective, success for hyper Liquid is success for Cosmos Tech.
00:37:50.158 - 00:38:06.552, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's one thing that it's hyper liquid and they also have bear chain coming out. I don't know how, like with Barachain, I'm not sure how it's going at this point, but, I mean, those are like two of the biggest names that are launching, and they're both launching on Cosmos.
00:38:06.696 - 00:38:09.040, Speaker C: And you can make the same point about DYDX, right?
00:38:09.160 - 00:38:10.184, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true.
00:38:10.352 - 00:38:21.620, Speaker D: Dydx celestial. Apparently Monad is using a fork of tendermint as well.
00:38:24.480 - 00:38:26.980, Speaker B: If only there was a way to make Adam go up.
00:38:27.920 - 00:38:36.520, Speaker C: Unfortunately, they didn't put a, you know, fee switch for, you know, use of tendermint and IBC to feedback to the, to the token, so.
00:38:36.940 - 00:39:08.070, Speaker B: Oh, well, it's one of the saddest things, I think, is the cosmo the fact that cosmos is actually utilized more than like anything else, probably for good projects, and then nothing happens to the cosmos. One more thing that we've had over the weekend is sanctum launched, not the weekend. I think they launched it today. They launched profiles V two, a new frantic type system that I want Danny to introduce to us.
00:39:08.410 - 00:40:41.188, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not fully positive if the profiles V two is fully at this kind of friendtech style application launch yet, but I think kind of the details and information they're adding in there and building out with profiles can become interesting. There was a tweet from one of the team members discussing just some interesting things that they'd like to do with Sanctum going into the future. One of those being some sort of social fi application similar to Friendtech where the core idea would be rather than to purchase, like with Friendtech, you purchase someone's keys or their token basically to get access to their, you know, their chat or their content, essentially with sanctum, with the LST, kind of make any LST that you want on their protocol. The point I think in that case would be creators would have their own kind of person specific LST of a creator specific LST that could be minted. And people that want access to their content could then mint or swap into that LST, hold it in their wallet, get access to the content, and then the creator in exchange could get a portion of the fees from the stake revenue from those tokens. It's an interesting switch up. It's not quite a full on trading application, you might say, where friend tech keys and other implementations of a similar protocol have been wanting to trade up and around the price of a particular person or idea or creator.
00:40:41.188 - 00:41:14.360, Speaker C: In this case it would probably be a bit more fixed to whatever asset is used in this case, if it's stake sol just dealing with the cost of stake sold in that case, but probably more fixed kind of price approach to things and then the revenue back to creators rather than kind of maybe fleecing your audience, I guess if you want to call it that. Instead you just be looking at some sort of maybe flat percentage from the staking rewards. Quite a shift, I think, in that model, which I think is interesting.
00:41:15.140 - 00:41:30.880, Speaker B: That is interesting. I think sanctum is one that we should question about. Do you think it's all mercenary and people will leave? Or do you think we have a lot of believers in individualized hundred thousand LSD, different types of LSD on Solana?
00:41:31.180 - 00:42:51.790, Speaker C: I'll say as a user and you know, stake soul of various type person myself I do find their product quite valuable. The really interesting aspect is for businesses, protocols, projects, anyone to be able to kind of create their own stake to soul variant through the platform. It's like this interesting method of, rather than asking people to directly pay for services, they've found this nice way to have people kind of, you can pick something that you're interested in and a team that you want to support and you can instead just stake your soul using their variant. You're still making all the, you know, if you're a sole believer and you, you know, you're still earning most of that stake reward, but you can kind of decide to sort of elect to delegate that, you know, whatever fee if it's a few percentage points off the stake rewards to that project. I think it's a really interesting model and it's not, you know, not quite so mercenary because you can, you know, if I just want to hold some other stake token, I would go ahead and do that. You know, they're earning the similar staking rate as other available liquid staked salon tokens within the ecosystem. So there might be people chasing an airdrop, but if you're already a stake sole holder, there's not really much reason for you to jump in and then jump back out.
00:42:52.130 - 00:43:49.220, Speaker A: I think that this notion that there should be tens or hundreds or thousands of liquid staking tokens for the same asset is exactly the opposite of what a liquid staking asset is supposed to be. I think it adds fragmentation to look, the only job of a liquid staking token is to be liquid. And the best liquid staking token will be as liquid as the underlying. When you create all different types or many, many different liquid staking tokens for the same asset, you add slippage and bigger spreads to all those trading pairs. And for that reason, this market will not scale to be anything beyond airdrop farmers, in my view.
00:43:49.720 - 00:44:31.612, Speaker B: To be fair to the sanctum team the way that they like, I agree with you and the sense that in general there should be as few lsts as possible. But to be fair to the sanctum team, they do have like quite an elegant design. They use stake accounts that are like inbuilt Solana, and then you only trade through infinity, I think. Or it's because it just matches directly and I think it's like uniquely enabled by Solana because unstaking is relatively easy on Solana. So it's like, I think in that sense it's, I still agree with you and that you want as few as possible. But to be fair, to them Solana. And the way that they've done it is likely the only way that it could work.
00:44:31.612 - 00:44:52.010, Speaker B: If it did work. Like this multi LST environment where you can give 5% of your emission rewards to somebody so that they can post meme calls in their telegram group that you follow. But that's the only one that like sanctum is the only way that it would work. Probably, yeah.
00:44:52.090 - 00:45:25.170, Speaker A: The problem is that there's still no point to it. If you. The reason to take and to. The reason to add incremental illiquidity or to diversify into a different staked sole asset is to get a different yield profile, right? That's like, that's literally the only reason. And the yield difference on these lsts like rounds to zero. There's no differentiation. And you're just getting whatever you're getting issuance and fees and meth or some combination of those.
00:45:25.170 - 00:45:47.490, Speaker A: The only difference is going to be on the take rate of the validator and that's not going to vary much at all. So, like, you're adding product differentiation to a market where there is no differentiation and then causing potential liquidity problems in the future. No one at scale is going to be participating in that model.
00:45:48.590 - 00:46:20.626, Speaker B: I think a cool way for them to implement this will be in the future that they do some form of like liquidity mining through it. So like you, like Danny said, the whole point was that you can hold your own Solana and still like give some percentage of it away. And I think that's what they will do. Like, you'll still own your own Solana. Let's say like some new lending product launches in three months on Solana and they need Solana liquidity. You can just liquid stake it through them, through their sanctum LSD. And I think that.
00:46:20.626 - 00:46:39.474, Speaker B: And then there's some form of yield differentiation because they'll be emitting rewards to you. Still not good enough differentiation, probably. And still you could just do the same thing through the. Just giving the token in the lending pools. But I mean, it could at least be experimental. I guess. There's not really a point to it.
00:46:39.474 - 00:46:42.110, Speaker B: I agree with you. I can't spin it.
00:46:42.980 - 00:47:17.030, Speaker C: I think you make a good point, Ryan. I wouldn't argue that any large players would or should probably try to enter in the way that you're describing. But I do think it sets up an interesting potential for just a consumer application for retail enjoyers of the space. If that means they never get massive size buying sanctum stake Sol tokens, that's totally fine. If they make a cool app and it's meaningful, and people are willing to use those stake soul variants to interact with the platform, then I'd call it a win.
00:47:19.250 - 00:48:10.320, Speaker A: So when a retail user has one of these individually staked things across the very narrow validator set or staked to a creator or whatever, the holding times on these things are super low. Crypto is very short term, short term oriented. When the person goes to sell that, are they going to incur, and they incur that slippage, they just go to Jupiter and they punch an order because they're realizing volatility or there's an opportunity elsewhere and they want to move quickly out of this asset and they see that large slippage amount. I mean, I would assume that that's like a pretty bad ux, right? Like they're gonna like that. That's not gonna be. That's not gonna be something that people gloss over. Or am I wrong?
00:48:11.060 - 00:49:03.090, Speaker C: I suppose it depends. I think if people approach it that way, right? If they kind of market order into one of these tokens, maybe not through the sanctum application itself, from what Bach was mentioning, I do think they have a fairly interesting kind of mechanism set up behind it where they're sort of all. There's like this kind of unified stake pool where they're grabbing the stake out of each of these tokens and they house it all together. And when you then go and redeem your variant, it's hitting against that kind of unified pool. So I think if people are interacting with it in sort of the native way, like making use of sanctum itself, I don't know that that is that much of a concern, though. I think it would be a good question for that team or to dig deeper with those guys. I haven't looked too far into how that math really plays out.
00:49:03.090 - 00:49:27.140, Speaker C: But, yeah, I think to your point, I think from my understanding, if someone then went and tried to sell 100,000 or a million of their token on Jupiter instead, you probably would just eat market slippage there and it wouldn't feel great. But I think the app and what they've built itself interacting directly with the pool that they've defined for it alleviates that concern to a great extent, from what I know.
00:49:27.560 - 00:49:40.072, Speaker B: Yeah. And I agree with Danny. I don't think everything needs to be the ultimate app. Some things can just be relevant for ten to 20,000 people. Like a small thing, it's just cool. You can just semi use it.
00:49:40.216 - 00:50:21.160, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think if you think they're trying to make a friend tech you don't need funds buying it, you want users who will use it. So if the UX for like an app or I, you know, is good and it makes sense and people are willing to sort of use the stake soul tokens as a means to interact, then it could be good. If people don't want, you know, want to use stake soul for that type of purpose, then maybe it won't do so well. But I think for retail it's probably not as big of a concern. Right. If you need to lock up one stake soul or you know, get, you know, creator as one or two stake sold from them to see their I private content, probably not so bad.
00:50:22.220 - 00:50:53.280, Speaker B: Yeah, and I don't see any institution ever going for these types of products anyway. We had a similar thing on we like, I'm the developer of Ethereum. On Ethereum they had a similar product called Unsheath, not the same, but semi similar. And it got hacked. I think like the more complexity you add to staking derivatives, um, it's just, it's never really worth it. It's the same as like adding too much complexity to lending stuff. You want it like very basic, very simple.
00:50:53.280 - 00:50:59.100, Speaker B: Um, so I don't really see like anybody really at scale using sanctum, which is fine.
00:50:59.600 - 00:51:30.592, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think for larger operators, like I don't think they'd be interested in these stake Sol variants, if anything, you know, if this business model works out and it's a great platform, they'd probably want to buy the cloud token or whatever their platform token is going to be. That might return revenues from the business model. If it turns out to be the best social fi platform and you can see the user metrics going up and the activity going up and the revenues are great, then why would you hold the stakes all you'd want the token.
00:51:30.616 - 00:51:35.180, Speaker B: In that case, at least they're trying something new, which I like.
00:51:35.600 - 00:51:39.850, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting nonetheless, whether it works or nothing. That's a big TBD.
00:51:40.630 - 00:51:44.770, Speaker B: We'll see TBD this week, I think is when they're launching the token. Right?
00:51:45.430 - 00:51:49.850, Speaker C: Yet soon. I don't know if I've seen a date, but it might be out there.
00:51:50.350 - 00:51:59.062, Speaker B: Thought it was this week. We'll see. Do we have anything else that we want to mention that is very important for our listeners to hear about?
00:51:59.206 - 00:52:01.382, Speaker C: Oh, you're right. It's the 18th, by the way.
00:52:01.446 - 00:52:08.020, Speaker B: Wow. Stimmy checks on the 18th. All right, Danny, Luke Ryan, thank you so much for joining.
00:52:09.720 - 00:52:10.900, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:52:11.560 - 00:52:12.820, Speaker D: Pleasure hopping on.
00:52:16.360 - 00:52:27.160, Speaker B: Guys. To our listeners Ryan was very quiet because it's 130 degrees in whatever room he's in right now, so he's very upset. Thank you for listening. Have a fantastic evening.
