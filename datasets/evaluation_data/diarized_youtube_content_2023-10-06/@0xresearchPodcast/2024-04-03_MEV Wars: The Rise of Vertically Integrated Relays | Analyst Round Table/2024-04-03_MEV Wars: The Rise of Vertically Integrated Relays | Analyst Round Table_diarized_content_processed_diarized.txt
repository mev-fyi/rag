00:00:00.160 - 00:00:25.754, Speaker A: W is going to be one of the biggest airdrops of all time. Definitely one of the biggest this cycle. And so it's going to be a lot, a lot of value being dropped to Solana users that they're definitely going to go and use to speculate on other things. So I'm curious to see how these airdrops affect the ecosystem, what people are going to be bidding with their newfound capital, how well these assets trade. Yeah, pretty excited overall.
00:00:28.534 - 00:00:45.718, Speaker B: Before we get into today's episode, just a quick disclaimer.

00:00:45.846 - 00:01:13.134, Speaker C: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. The Blockworks research team is back again to bring you another episode of an analyst Roundtable. Today is Monday, April 1, and we are joined by westy and effort capital from the Blockworks research team to jam on the latest market happenings. As always, you can use code Zero X research ten at app dot blockworksresearch.com for 10% off your annual blockworks research subscription. Ren, do you want to kick us off this week with some news and governance updates?
00:01:13.434 - 00:01:51.530, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. I think the first big news of last week was that CCTV goes live on Solana, or, sorry, went live on March 26. I think traditionally, bridging to Solana from EVM or any chain really hasn't been the best experience. I think most people either have to use like some shitty bridge or they need to route through a centralized exchange. So CCTV going live on Solana feels like a relatively big unlock, to be honest. And CCTP has done a whole lot for the cosmos ecosystem, more specifically DydX to Noble, and maybe we'll see the same. But it also does feel like that most people that wanted a reason to be on Solana had one already.
00:01:51.530 - 00:02:24.978, Speaker B: They weren't waiting for CCTV to bridge there. But yeah, there's been a few early integrators, notably Cube and drift, and I'm sure CCTV money will have Solana integrated, if it hasn't already. So that's super exciting for Solana. Congratulations to them. Something else on the slightly more governance side of things is that Arbitrum Foundation's grant program is moving to phase three. This is going to open on April 15. It's focusing on Dapps and has like 40 different tracks, whether that's like RWAS dev tuning, defi deep in infra, NFT, social.
00:02:24.978 - 00:03:06.438, Speaker B: Basically anything that's adapt, to be honest. So if you want to go build an arbitrary, you should probably check it out. I'm not sure how much money is being given out, but it does seem like a relatively big grants program. The next news and governance update is that Sonic SVM, which is basically they're going to launch like a modular SVM chain built to enable sovereign game economies on Solana. It really feels like they're focused on the whole gaming thing, whether they'll be able to compete with algorithms, since it seems like gaming is kind of arbitrarily at this point, will remain to be seen. They have this thing called hypergrid. You're free to use any game engine of choice, and it's a multi vm ecosystem powered by the hypergrid interpreter.
00:03:06.438 - 00:03:13.354, Speaker B: But I'm going to take a pause there. Anyone have any thoughts on CCTP, arbitrum grant, or this sonic SVM?
00:03:16.534 - 00:03:54.018, Speaker A: Yeah, touching on the arbitrum grants piece. I think we're really going to start to see a lot of these l two s begin to focus on specific niches. And I think this is sort of a good way for arbitrum to feel out which niches are probably best suited for that chain. I know they've been really focusing on gaming recently. They also are pretty big in the perp space. I think those are two that I think we know arbitrum is really good at. Maybe they find another niche they didn't know about, but I really think, like, like, a lot of these l two s are going to begin to narrow their focus and be less general purpose and have specific niches that they nail down.
00:03:54.018 - 00:03:57.334, Speaker A: And this is one, I guess, step towards that for arbitrum.
00:04:00.994 - 00:04:24.386, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll just be interested to see, like, how effective some of these spends are. Cause, like, obviously, you know, you need structure, you need KPI reporting. Like, there's just a lot that goes into it. And when you have like a very large sum of money, it's. It's almost difficult to deploy that amount of money. Like, you even see it with optimism. They have, I think it's $750 million of op incentives they're handing out over the next season of RGPF.
00:04:24.386 - 00:04:33.374, Speaker C: So definitely a lot of work left to be done here. But nonetheless, I think using these tokens to actually incentivize development is a ten out of ten idea.
00:04:33.794 - 00:05:18.710, Speaker B: I think it's interesting. I feel like at this point of arbitrary optimism, the app developers shouldn't need any external incentives or funding to build within an ecosystem. Like, hopefully at this point. I know, like we're so in the grand scheme of things so early too everything, but it feels like for our treatment and optimism, like, you shouldn't have to rely on like these grant programs or external incentives to get developers to burden your ecosystem. And I think that partially shows in optimism's decision to rename their thing from like retroactive public goods funding to just retroactive funding, um, instead of like just public goods. Um, but yeah, we'll see. And like, arbitrary muscle has that 400 million gaming fund that's going to like the DAO proposal process.
00:05:18.710 - 00:05:30.714, Speaker B: And in the forums, I don't know whether that pass or not, but I don't feel like you should be doing too many grants, to be honest. This seems more so like a BD branding game at this point for algorithm and optimism specifically.
00:05:32.374 - 00:06:06.234, Speaker A: Yeah, that's definitely one thing they need to be careful of is arbitrum like foundation and DAO is seeming to spend a lot of money recently, and especially with the first s tips as part of the DAO, they didn't really do a great job in like figuring out KPI's and what kind of spend worked. And we're going into, I guess, the ltiPs, the long term incentive program, and I hope that they don't continue overspending on certain things and they figure out where money is best spent. So yeah, that's just one thing they need to keep an eye on.
00:06:08.014 - 00:06:08.414, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:06:08.454 - 00:06:50.776, Speaker B: Moving on to a few other news and governance updates. One notable one from last week is Ritual's partnership with Celestia. Basically same as everything else, ritual is going to plan on using Celestia as its DA layer for the ritual super chain. Another thing which I might get for capital in here to explain a bit more, is partial says security in the cosmos, basically Eigen layer in the Cosmos land, which says the stakeholder stage for permissionless shared security, whereby validators can opt into any consumer chain to validate. And then just a few small, minor ones to close this off. Fishma finance underwent an exploit last week. I don't know how Fishmo has been doing, to be honest, for the past God knows how long, but I'm sure the token price was down only since it launched.
00:06:50.776 - 00:07:33.660, Speaker B: And then one intro, which is a liquidity bootstrapping protocol on Solana. I think this one's relatively interesting. Sure, I get that a lot of Dapps developers, whoever, don't want a huge amount of liquidity for the token, given that it results in token prices pumping easier or faster. But I mean I just looking at like Snurf and whatever ridiculous amount of liquidity it has, probably north of 100 million today. It's like pretty crazy seeing something with that much liquidity on chain. And yeah, I think there's an argument to be made for some protocols like you. You should have increased liquidity on chain because if you don't, it bars some like large holders or institutional holders from like allocating towards your token.
00:07:33.660 - 00:07:50.864, Speaker B: But that's a super long discussion. And the last news and governance update of the week is that Uniswap has a proposal for deploying on say and a vote is lie for funding a Treasury management council with 6000 uni. But I'll stop there. Anyone have thoughts on all of those?
00:07:52.424 - 00:07:57.280, Speaker C: I'd like to get effort's take on the partial set security. It seems like ICS 2.0 for the hub.
00:07:57.312 - 00:08:37.592, Speaker D: Is it? Yeah. So I guess the best way I can explain it is Cosmos Hub launched interchange security last year. It was like the long awaited feature upgrade for the hub. Pretty much the entire purpose of the hub from day one was really supposed to be the shared security network or provider for the entire cosmos ecosystem. And then ICS V one launch, which is replicated security. And it put the burden on governance token holders and the validators as well, to decide what consumer chains which are effectively like AVss in Eigen layer world, what consumer chains at the hub want to, you know, provide security for. The problem is it creates like adverse selection the governance token.
00:08:37.592 - 00:09:09.730, Speaker D: The token holders, token holders really don't know exactly like what is a good AV's or good consumer chain or what isn't. And once a consumer chain got approved, pass through governance to be secured. It forces all 180 validators in the active set, big and small, to support a consumer chain. Some validators are making hand over fist in terms of from atom inflation. So they'd be happy to support new chains. There's validators lower in the active set that just like don't have the. You're not getting enough commission in order to actually support an extra chain.
00:09:09.730 - 00:09:42.744, Speaker D: It adds additional opex. Got to run a new binary, maybe you have to hire additional DevOps. So it created this permission shared security feature that I think was a good v one, but it limited, I think the potential for what the hub could be. When you look at Eigen layer, one of the beautiful things about Eigen layer that everyone's so bullish on, it creates this permissionless shared security marketplace. Validators and ABS's are competing for really like eight security, which you can say is like this scarce commodity. What this ICS 2.0 is, this part said security, it's the exact same thing.
00:09:42.744 - 00:10:24.914, Speaker D: It's actually the first version of restaking, permissionless restaking out in the wild that we're going to see prior to Eigen layer launching. I'm assuming sometime in Q, two validators get to decide what consumer chains they want to secure. A consumer chain pretty much submits a transaction to the hub and then I think, I don't know the exact mechanics yet. It isn't live. I know that obviously, the government's proposal that is being voted on right now, but validators get to opt in or opt out to secure consumer chain. So theoretically, you could see a bunch of current cosmos chains start leveraging the hub security. They can lower their overall security budget by 25 to 50, I'm sorry, lowered by 85% to 75%, depending.
00:10:24.914 - 00:10:58.596, Speaker D: It's just going to create a competitive marketplace for the hub security offering. And I think it's going to be interesting to see how much demand is there for Adam as like the security backstop for the cosmos ecosystem. So really bullish on this. I think getting away from the hub, leaning on, on chain governance, even though on chain governance, I think is one of its strongest suits. And there's certain areas where governance is probably needed. I think letting the hub, letting the free market decide, like, what the demand there is for Atom security is a really big bullish catalyst for the hub. So I'm really excited to see that launch.
00:10:58.596 - 00:11:25.944, Speaker D: There's a couple other things going on in the background to start bundling other services on top of shared security, because shared security by itself is going to be commoditized service offering in the long run. So I think a lot of people are really understanding how far ahead in terms of thinking about the shared security marketplace that Cosmos hub is compared to a lot of hot new topics like Eigen layer. But yeah, I mean, long winded answers, it really just is a permissionless shared security offering.
00:11:26.564 - 00:12:04.350, Speaker B: I have a quick question for everyone here. Something I just randomly thought about over the weekend. Basically, I think you've seen tweets that say stuff like share security, eigen layer or whatever decreases the opportunity cost of restaking because you already have that negative eave staking yield. And so whatever else you're providing security to doesn't need as much yield as you would have had to, like, admit had there, like, been no native e free staking. And I thought about it like, sure. I kind of get that. But then I thought about a bit more.
00:12:04.350 - 00:12:29.404, Speaker B: I was like, wait a minute. That makes like, zero sense. You are taking, say, like, an additional, like, 20% of your collateral, like, stashing risk. Why is the fact that you're having native eve staking yield, like, decrease the amount of compensation you need for that extra amount of, like, 20% stashing risk you take? It should still be the same whether you were there's, like, native e staking or not. No, preach.
00:12:30.424 - 00:13:10.162, Speaker D: I feel like. I feel like I've been speaking, yelling into the void about this. Like, I think that's the biggest meme that's being propagated all throughout, like, crypto space, that because ETH is already a yield bearing asset, that it's going to lower the security costs. Sorry, all abs is if I'm an ETH staker, which I'm not today, but if I wasn't e three staker and I was putting up my, like, blue chip yield bearing asset that might about to launch, like, an e three ETH ETF and become, like, this next institutional grade crypto asset, like, I am not going to be restaking my ETH to get, like, 0.001% yield on that. For restaking an abs that probably doesn't find product market fit. It's not worth the risk.
00:13:10.162 - 00:13:37.338, Speaker D: And this slashing risk is actually some of the issues that Cosmos hub community has already gone through, because there's almost a major slashing event for two validators at the Cosmos hub. But governance kind of stepped in and removed that slashing risk because it was like a very specific niche issue. But I 100% agree with you, Ron. I think that's like a big meme that's being said. I don't believe that that's the case. I think that there's going to be. There's a lot more ETH capital that's trying to chase yield, and there's a lot of abs.
00:13:37.338 - 00:13:58.144, Speaker D: They're not going to be able to offer that yield. What's going to end up happening is liquidity mining, but security mining. Abs are going to pay a shit ton of money to attract e three staking. And then the moment that, well, dries up, operators and those delegates are going to move on to the next abs. I'm very. I'm not bearish on agile erics. I'm fundamentally bullish on this idea of fair security.
00:13:58.144 - 00:14:06.624, Speaker D: But I think, like, that specific meme is probably not true, even though it's been propagated a lot by very big brains. In the space.
00:14:07.884 - 00:15:03.284, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely agree with everything effort said. You need to evaluate each AV's on its own set of risks and return, because it doesn't matter that there's like a backstop of yield, because each AV's gives you a certain percentage, basically of you getting your entire ETH slashed. And so that should be like, you basically need to calculate on an individual basis, because let's say one person is staking just regular ETH and then restaking, and there's another world in which you're just restaking to one AV's. They're still subject to the same exact slashing conditions on that abs, despite one of them having a backstop and the other not. So if they are both basically under the conditions where they get slashed and they both get slashed the same amount. So for me, yeah, it doesn't make sense at all. You need to evaluate each based on their own individual risk characteristics.
00:15:04.064 - 00:15:38.604, Speaker C: I agree. But at the same time, like, on the other hand, I would be incredibly surprised if we see even a single slashing incidence on an ABS over the course of the next twelve to 24 months. Like, I think you're going to see validators try and cover as many different avss as they possibly can in order to increase their yield, which ultimately is probably bad for the health of the Ethereum network. But at the end of the day, like, you're going to chase that yield. So I see both. I see both sides, although I do agree, like, at the end of the day, like, you should be compensated accordingly for the risk you're taking of being slashed.
00:15:39.284 - 00:16:19.354, Speaker B: Yeah, I just had another random thought too. Like why is the amount of like attributable security I get denominated in ETH? Like if ETH like five xs, then I need to like assuming my token price doesn't move, I need to like five x the amount of tokens that I need to pay out for a restaker to receive, like the same like percentage yield. And similarly like in a bear market, right? Like EF and bitcoin are probably the two assets that have the smallest drawdown, but my token is going to like draw down like 90% while you've draw downs like 50% or whatever. And that means I need like double my emissions. Like that seems slightly problematic, but that's not like a fully thought out thought yet.
00:16:19.814 - 00:16:27.834, Speaker D: Just do what third chain does and assume that your token is going to outperform bitcoin or ETH market. Great tokenomics.
00:16:29.134 - 00:16:58.638, Speaker C: I've got one more thing on the news and governance updates that we just don't have written down here. But I did want to mention it. Echo launched last week by like invite code only, which is cobies new project that is basically just democratizing access to like seed round investing, essentially. So very cool platform. It's like all smart contract enabled. So you just send like, you know, USDC from, from your address and then you get paid back the tokens and the address you sent and there's vesting and stuff all on chain. So cool initiative.
00:16:58.638 - 00:17:15.234, Speaker C: I actually don't know a ton about it. All I know is I try to do the KYC stuff that they go through and I think Kobe's on his laptop somewhere around the world trying to figure out why my KYC didn't go through. So thank you, Kobe, for doing that. But yeah, I thought that was pretty cool. I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on echo as a whole.
00:17:15.814 - 00:17:48.374, Speaker D: He should be on the cool throne. I think my man's got banned from Angellist and was like, screw that, and making a web3 for a crypto version of this. And who else better to do it than Kobe? He's probably on the crypto mount Rushmore of best CT influencers or best CT personnel ever. No, like specific entitled thoughts on it. I mean, I'm really bullish on this idea, like democratizing capital allocation, of getting like private round allocation from normal people. That was one of the reasons why I personally got into crypto, like back in 2017. I love this idea of lowering the barriers of entry.
00:17:48.374 - 00:18:21.894, Speaker D: Get anyone the opportunity. Obviously we're seeing this play out like the meme coin space, but anyone can kind of hit on a lot of ticket and become a millionaire. But would love to see this in giving people access to invest, like, legitimate projects. Early on we got the ICO boom was the entire, like, that was the right way. We should have been doing this all along. And now we went Dean complete opposite way with projects going live at like $10 billion valuations or something ridiculous. And little people that don't have access private rounds are obviously getting drafted in the public, in the liquid markets once those token goes live.
00:18:21.894 - 00:18:26.538, Speaker D: So overall, I mean, I commend Kobe for doing this. I hope it succeeds.
00:18:26.706 - 00:19:32.804, Speaker B: I'm going to be a bit cynical here from like a builder or like a developer perspective, right? If I had the choice to raise between just retail and democratizing that opportunity for retail versus raising from KOLs or VC's, I feel like I would actually still prefer to raise from VC's or KLS because obviously those do provide a pretty significant benefit at the end of the day just from even just branding alignment or amplification perspective. But like, if you're thinking about like raising from retail for like, oh, you know, like I'll get retail like financially aligned from like day one because they're gonna be in my seed round. Like, I don't think you need that because if your project is exciting, like retail is gonna come and farm your points anyway, even if they're not like invested in like your seed series, a pre seed whatever round. And sure, I like the idea of like democratizing access and like investment opportunities to everyone, but I'm just trying to think from like a builder perspective why I would do it. And I'm not sure I have a fantastic answer yet, to be honest.
00:19:33.184 - 00:20:13.714, Speaker D: To me, I would say, like, why not both, right? Like today you kind of have to go, not have to go the VC route. But obviously it's a lot of what people do, VC's and Kols. But I feel like this, this allows people to, this allows builders to do both at the same time. Get the big names on your cap table that are value add from the get go while also giving, potentially democratizing the access to give smaller people the opportunity to get in as well. And I think having that foundational bottoms up, it's a top down and bottoms up capital raising methodology, I think that it's gonna be really interesting to see how it plays out and how products do once they launch off of an echo round.
00:20:14.094 - 00:20:57.856, Speaker C: Yeah, I should also add to the platform. Once you go in there, it has like, you can join different groups. So I don't know what would be stopping a large vc from like, you know, making a little group potentially with like five other top quality vc's. And then that's a closed group and that's like an elite group you'd source funding from. Or maybe it's Ansem and he's a key, you know, Kol, obviously, which by the way, I learned like literally a week ago, that's key opinion leader. I didn't know that that's, there's like a new term in this week or in this space like every single week. But I think it'd be good for him to be able to have his top 1000 followers who are involved with him and interact with him on Twitter and then instead of him just going and shilling the product to people, once it's on Mainnet, they actually were in with him at the same exact price as they were prior.
00:20:57.856 - 00:21:01.564, Speaker C: So I think the gated groups creates an interesting dynamic.
00:21:02.624 - 00:21:23.270, Speaker D: One quick thing, I actually thought Kol was a specific crypto term. My wife's in the pharmaceutical industry, and she used it like, two weeks into her new job, and she said, kol. I was like, wait, where'd you hear that term before? She's like, that's what they call it in my industry. I was like, oh, wow, that's completely new to me. Like, I always thought that was specifically like, a crypto term for, you know, professional shiller, but apparently not.
00:21:23.462 - 00:21:36.398, Speaker C: That is funny. It's. Yeah, I actually, I had a similar experience for TLDR like a year or two ago. My mom is in law, and she said, TLDr. And I was like, have you been listening to my podcast? And she was like, no, just too long. Didn't read. We use it in law all the time.
00:21:36.398 - 00:21:44.254, Speaker C: I was like, oh, how about that? We got hot seat cool throne set up. Ren, why don't I kids, you kick it over to you for, uh, for your hot cedar cool throne, I guess.
00:21:44.554 - 00:22:26.118, Speaker B: Yeah, this week, a little nerdy, a little technical, some mev, ethereum order flow stuff. So first things first, this Titans integrated relay. So for those who aren't that familiar of what a relay or a relay is, it sort of sits between the proposer and the builder. The most famous relay is probably Mebb boost, but Titan is the largest non censoring builder, and they just launched a relay. But it's a little different from other existing relays. It only accepts blocks from their own builder, and it doesn't send most of these blocks to other relays. So if that sounds like vertical integration to you, that's because it is vertical integration.
00:22:26.118 - 00:23:20.684, Speaker B: When the relay is also the builder, then there effectively is no proposal builder separation, which was, I think, what a lot of flashbots work was basically trying to get rid of. And truth be told, I think someone would have done it sooner or later, especially in the face of blobs. The additional timing games that I think P two B started playing probably a few months ago, and blobs introduced additional latency into the blocks. And so having this vertically integrated builder, where you're able to decrease the time between block construction and block production, it's just like such an advantage, especially heading into a bull market with increased on chain activity. But, yeah, this is about as vertically integrated as you can get. All you need is some exclusive order flow, some private RPC, and it's just complete vertical integration. I don't think it's a great look for the ethereum ecosystem to be honest.
00:23:20.684 - 00:24:07.660, Speaker B: And data always has some great tweets, so definitely go check them out if you want a better rundown of what happened. But yeah, this Titan video has an insane share of execution. For example, Titan is at 84% this past week, versus 49% for blocks found, 31% for flashbots, 23% for ultrasound. And I think one really interesting takeaway from this that was like, an opinion that I saw people had on Twitter was that ethereum researchers and Ethereum foundation don't talk to, like, the mev people at all. And the mev people don't talk to the Ethereum people at all. They're like, both kind of building in their own world. And this has resulted, like, in some significant problems, like, just like, different job functions, doing, like, the opposite of their job functions.
00:24:07.660 - 00:24:19.104, Speaker B: You know, I don't know, like, long term where this goes to. Or maybe, like, Ethereum has to break some form of, like, credible neutrality. But it'll be interesting to see how the community tackles this.
00:24:19.604 - 00:24:21.704, Speaker D: Wesley, you want to go as our MVP client?
00:24:22.794 - 00:25:06.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll give it a go, but yeah, like, to me, the sort of centralization of builders has been inevitable since the construction of mev boost and flashbots in general. I mean, we're already seeing this on, like, the builder searcher side of things, where builders can see all the same transactions searchers can. So there's nothing stopping them from also becoming the best searchers and integrating. And we've seen that across the biggest builders, they have their own integrated searchers. They're either directly or teaming up with market makers themselves. So there's a lot of partnerships in that side of things. And now we're seeing sort of the other side of the coin, where there's partnerships between builders and proposers.
00:25:06.514 - 00:26:25.718, Speaker A: One of the reasons why, like, people argue this sort of breaks down PBS is that the whole point is that you're trusting relay and not an individual builder, because the relay is able to get a bunch of different blocks, figure out which is the highest value, and give that to the proposer. So it just, it also, like, minimizes trust in general. And so as a result, the proposer now has to trust the individual builder. But I would argue that that in this current case, may actually be a bigger benefit to the producer, specifically because, one, they have a pretty, like, steady stream of income or yield in this case, because they're probably getting paid directly from Titan. They're also, like, trusting in Titan's sophisticated ability to get to build the highest value block and a block that gets to them in time because we're seeing a lot of failed blocks on the network currently, and in the past there have been bugs, etcetera. So it may actually be better for them to trust a highly sophisticated builder for, for a couple of reasons there. And yeah, I mean, I guess what flashbots, Mevboost and PBS does is it at least showcases what's going on so we, we can talk about it on a podcast and figure out why this.
00:26:25.718 - 00:27:01.724, Speaker A: Maybe this is wrong, or maybe it's good, maybe it's bad, like, at least it's, you know, clarifying and making things transparent. But at the same time, you're sort of seeing things break down and it's super interesting. There's a lot of cool conversations happening in the MEV space along these lines, and then you have completely opposite situation with Cheeto and what's going on in Solana, etcetera. So if you're an MEV nerd like I am, you're definitely like living right now. There's a lot to digest and learn about. But yeah, this is, to me, inevitable that you're going to see centralization at the builder level.
00:27:03.164 - 00:27:42.792, Speaker C: Westy, do you think it'd be fair to point out it feels like the MeV pie on Ethereum is more so honestly shrinking than it is growing? Yes, we're kind of in a bull market and on chain activities returning. But if you look at the past three or four months, I don't think MeV is skyrocketed or anything, because it feels like a lot of this meme coin trading is happening on Solana or maybe other activities going to l two s. Do you think the fact that the MeV pie seems to be kind of going the wrong direction in terms of growth, like, makes the centralization problem worse because the incentive to extract the MEV isn't really growing? I don't know, that's kind of a weird question, but I think it is.
00:27:42.808 - 00:28:38.884, Speaker A: A fair question of what is the future of MeV on the l one, given that a lot of transactions value we're already seeing going to l two s, there has been a push from the Ethereum foundation, specifically Justin Drake, for base roll ups, where the l one is actually sequencing for these roll ups. And if that kind of feature takes off, you're going to see, I think, MeV value come back to the base layer because it will be the sequencer for a lot of these roll ups. But at the same time, that's a lot of value that the l two s themselves are going to want to capture. So I doubt that they just hand that off willingly. Although a lot of these ethereum roll ups are completely aligned with ethereum, and if a lot of roll ups start to buy in again, we've talked about shared sequencing in the past. If you get a lot of buy in from a lot of roll ups, then it becomes more valuable for the next roll up to join, et cetera. So if they gain traction, you could see that.
00:28:38.884 - 00:29:02.664, Speaker A: But the way things are currently going, it does look like the value of MeV on l one is shrinking, but then you're going to see more sophisticated games at the l two level, depending on how the roll up like integrates its sequencer, whether it's first come, first serve or they have some sort of PBS auction. It's going to be interesting to see the different dynamics across different roll ups, but that's definitely a trend I'm looking at. Yeah.
00:29:04.364 - 00:29:52.318, Speaker B: I think just following up on the l two discussion, I think Mev eventually comes to l two s, even if it hasn't. I just saw an interesting tweet this morning, which was that base had one of the nodes running like an old version of a client and had its P two P mempoo public for a few weeks, which is honestly pretty ridiculous, to be honest. I feel like there was some other version of this like half a year ago, but I forgot which l two it was, but it just sounded really familiar. And so, I mean, like MeV is definitely happening and with like Arbitrum's time boost, I don't know when that's going live, but that kind of feels like, kind of like priority transaction inclusion. If you like, pay a bit more. There's like a bit like, there's a bit of nuance to it. Like it's a bit like fairer than just like the.
00:29:52.318 - 00:30:15.374, Speaker B: Whoever has the highest priority fee gets faster transaction inclusion. But I feel like it's inevitable that MeV like, appears everywhere. It's just like what route do you want to take to mitigate it? I think even if you like, make a decision that just kills, like mev opportunities out there, like eventually the market will find a way if it gets big enough.
00:30:18.474 - 00:30:19.754, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a good take.
00:30:19.794 - 00:30:55.418, Speaker B: Ren, but I think another quick hot seat, or not really a hot seat for me, to be honest, more like a neutral seat is MeV blocker. So Mev blocker is Kousoft. Sort of like private RPC product. They launched this with a few other partners. I can't remember off the top of my head, I think it was like Beaver build, maybe. And then basically they're going to turn on the v switch for this. It's going to be a fixed amount per block one, the amount is updated monthly and it's a fraction of the average per block value of MeV blocker transactions during the previous month.
00:30:55.418 - 00:31:37.714, Speaker B: As of right now, the initial fee will be roughly 20% of the value of the average per block value of exclusive MEV blocker transactions. And then that's going to be split 50 50 between the Dao and MeV blocker partners. So blocker, MeV blocker users won't be affected by the fee. The fee is very much more so for any builders that are connected to MeV Blocker and it's relay. And like, so far, just from the numbers and analysis that they've done, it seems like a relatively low fee. There are some nuances there, though, because it's like an average fee, it's not calculated on a per block basis. And I think that makes sense, just given that we introduced too much, like, latency within the relay.
00:31:37.714 - 00:32:19.354, Speaker B: But, yeah, this only really becomes a problem when all builders have blocks of very low value. So imposing a fee turns the value of winning negative. And I think it'll be interesting to see, like, there's this right, which is like monetizing and turning on a fees such for like some mev mitigation solution. And on the other hand, you have like Geodo, which just killed this bamboo, and like, kind of quote unquote, like turned off, like a fee switch generator from the mempoo. They still make money from, like, atomic bundles and the other components of its block engine. But it'll be interesting to just watch and monitor, like, the social reaction, I guess, to like, monetizing, like any mev component or like mev infra.
00:32:21.334 - 00:32:58.502, Speaker C: I think. And I'm not 100% sure. But last I was checking in on this, on cow swap and the cow protocol in general. I believe this fee is paid at the end of each month, like Ren said, based on the trailing months average per block value of mev blocker transactions. And it's actually paid by the builders retroactively in cow. So they use the ETH rewards by cow, which has absolutely horrendous liquidity on chain. And then that's 50% return to the builder and or, sorry, the partners of Mev blocker, which is essentially the builders, and then 50% to the Dow is like pretty much protocol and liquidity.
00:32:58.502 - 00:33:12.274, Speaker C: So I think it's interesting from the perspective of the cow token, because historically they just haven't focused on value accrual there at all. And even just like, a fixed bid of five to ten e, the day could actually go, like, a very long way on. On those liquidity pools.
00:33:14.494 - 00:33:20.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree there, but I think that's a good point to kick it over to you, Sam, for your hotseato crew throne.
00:33:20.654 - 00:33:24.590, Speaker C: Yes, I have got airdrops in the cool throne.
00:33:24.622 - 00:33:24.766, Speaker D: Now.
00:33:24.790 - 00:34:01.894, Speaker C: This is going to air on Wednesday, so unfortunately, we will miss, like, the fun PA after we get W and INA on Wednesday and Tuesday, respectively. But Ina is trading at around a $9 billion fdv and W is trading at around a $17 billion fdv in pre launch futures markets. But there's very minimal volume on these and open interest, so take those with a grain of salt as usual. But nonetheless, that's no matter how you slice it, going to be a multi billion dollar stimulus package hitting various eoas on Ethereum. So Athena. Athena. As well as starting a SATs campaign in lieu of introducing bitcoin as a collateral type.
00:34:01.894 - 00:34:55.787, Speaker C: And they noted in the announcement that on average, there's been about $25 billion of open interest at an average of 22% positive funding rates throughout 2024 thus far. So that's about $3 billion paid out to shorts, which is pretty, pretty wild. And they currently have 15% of ETH perpendicular global open interest, and funding has remained north of, you know, 40, 50% for most of the year. So safe to say they're absolutely printing on that one and are very eager to get more collateral. Um, but, yeah, so big airdrops coming, and then on top of that, you have Degen, which I know pretty much everyone on the team fumbled a bag at one point of that, and they have airdrop to checker Live, which basically rewards people who are posting on, uh, warpcast and other forecaster, uh, I guess client front ends. And that thing's run to over a $2 billion valuation. So that airdrop started out as pretty irrelevant, but now is actually becoming quite relevant.
00:34:55.787 - 00:35:29.222, Speaker C: And just a fun caveat on that one, too. One confirmation, I believe it was bought a million dollars of djen, like, two months ago, and that is now worth, like, $100 million. So they hit a nice 100 x in about two months on this one. So hot tip to those guys over there. I wish I had that kind of conviction. Uh, another interesting caveat on Degen is Farcaster set an all time high in daily active users yesterday with over 70,000 daily active users, which, honestly, I'm just rooting for farcaster in general, I like decentralized social. I think it's a cool primitive within crypto, so I was happy to see that.
00:35:29.222 - 00:35:55.574, Speaker C: But on the same topic of airdrops, we've got parcel, which is coming soon. Maybe Randy can share some information about that when I'm done talking here. And then tensor, I believe, is coming soon as well. I couldn't locate the actual hard dates for those, but I believe those are expected in April. Ordinals enjoyers got airdropped. They've gotten plenty of stuff, but most recently they got the runestone, which is that community driven ordinals project that will eventually deliver runes. And those are trading at 0.05
00:35:55.574 - 00:36:42.580, Speaker C: bitcoin, or about three, four, $5,000 floor, depending on the day of where bitcoin is trading at. And it's becoming more common to NFT or, sorry, airdrop to NFT projects. So we've seen bad kids, maladies, penguins, mad lads, et cetera get airdropped, different things throughout the course of 2024, which is a bit of a new meta, but interesting nonetheless. So, yeah, I mean, airdrop farmers in 2023 definitely had a good year between, I think it was Arb or, sorry, blur as well as vertex was another good one. Probably missing a few here. But regardless, 2024 looks to be shaping up to be even bigger for airdrop farmers, which is something I wouldn't have predicted. I guess I missed GTO there.
00:36:42.580 - 00:36:53.732, Speaker C: I think Jito is at the. The end of 2023, so that one was pretty huge. But nevertheless, it just never ceases to amaze me how much money just gets, like, dropped to people in this. In this market.
00:36:53.788 - 00:36:53.996, Speaker D: It's.
00:36:54.020 - 00:37:00.344, Speaker C: It's absolutely bonkers. So cool. Throne is definitely the airdrop farmers, but not sure if you guys have any thoughts here.
00:37:01.564 - 00:37:39.538, Speaker B: Just super quickly on parcel, 7.5% of the supply is going to be distributed across parcel points holders. 0.4% of that is going to the NFT members, and 0.1% of the token supply is going to mad. I wonder if, for protocols with, like, a NFT collection, like, parcel tensor, how much they're going to give to the NFT collection. Because, you know, to be honest, like, if I bought an NFT for a protocol that gives me, like, a points boost or something, I don't think I would have expected to, like, get any of the token supply, like, specifically for the NFT collection.
00:37:39.538 - 00:38:15.280, Speaker B: So I think that's something interesting to see. And I think another interesting thing is, like, with parcel blast, Athena, you're like, you're seeing a lot more, or like maybe even edify. Like, you're seeing a lot more attention and focus being placed on the season. That's post the TGE rather than like, basically like, all of the air job happening. Like pre TG, which I think makes sense just given like bull market and the opportunities available. And like, Athena, like, that six week period from starting the airdrop like program to TG is like, pretty electric. And I do think that timelines will compress as we head into a bull market.
00:38:15.280 - 00:38:46.744, Speaker B: Like, just people will want more instant gratification. Another thing about forecaster, I think they announced something super cool over the weekend. I'm blanking on the name, but it was like dynamic frames or something. Like, you can interact with a frame and then depending on how you interact with it, the UI of the frame will actually change. So it's not like a static frame. And I think, once again, that opens up a bunch of opportunities and possibilities. I'm not too in tune with the far cross ecosystem, but I'm sure there's a lot of cool apps being built there right now.
00:38:49.644 - 00:39:41.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of these teams are looking at successive recent airdrops, ether five being one of those, Jupiter being another, which is about to flip Celestia in value. They're seeing how well these new tokens are doing, and I think they finally see, like, it's time to drop the token because we're in a very positive environment. People like the new and shiny thing. And so, yeah, we're gonna see a lot of them lined up. You mentioned a bunch of them, but, like, in particular, Solana is gonna get a very big, like, stimulus check, basically, to a lot of their users. In the same way that Jito in the fall sort of was a catalyst for a lot of growth within, I guess, like, the meme coin sector and other AI defi coins within Solana. Like, w is going to be one of the biggest airdrops of all time.
00:39:41.824 - 00:40:04.714, Speaker A: Definitely one of the biggest this cycle. And so that's going to be a lot, a lot of value being dropped to Solana users that they're definitely going to go and use to speculate on other things. So I'm curious to see how these airdrops affect the ecosystem, what people are going to be bidding with their newfound capital, how well these assets trade. Yeah. Pretty excited overall.
00:40:09.254 - 00:40:33.700, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm just, it's mind boggling, quite honestly. Like, I can't wrap my head around the fact that it's multi billion dollar airdrop season. It's super crazy, so. And I also find, like, the valuations really interesting. Like, we've seen Jup perform incredibly well since getting launched, and people were dancing on the grave, like, two months ago. And the same goes with Jito. I think Jito is, like, pretty close to all time highs right now.
00:40:33.700 - 00:41:07.534, Speaker C: So, like, the post TGE slash airdrop price action has actually been surprisingly strong. So it definitely makes you, like, think, you know, is this something we should actually dump, or is this something you should hold? Like, Ina in particular is interesting to me just because, like, the sheer amount of revenue they generate, and I know that's like a complete meme in a bull run, but, like, we're talking, like, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue at a dappler from two asset carry slash basic basis trades is, like, basically what we're looking at here by the end of 2024. So definitely a cool time to be in crypto at the dappler.
00:41:11.754 - 00:41:24.890, Speaker B: All right, I think that's a good point to throw to westy for his hot sequest. And as a side note, holy shit. I did not realize Jupiter was trading at $16 billion FTP. What? That's. All right, Wesley, go ahead.
00:41:25.042 - 00:42:14.310, Speaker A: Yeah, it's insane, but, yeah, I've. I've blasted the hot seat. So, basically, there's a NFT collection called munchables that was seeing exponential growth. Growth on blast, and they suffered an exploit to the tune of roughly $62 million at the time. Zach XPT, alongside some use of vulgar language against the exploiter, uncovered how it happened. Basically, the team hired four developers that all referred each other, found out that it's actually just one Dev in North Korea who was able to basically siphon the funds to himself. Zach and some other security researchers were able to somehow recover the private keys containing the funds and return it back to the protocol.
00:42:14.310 - 00:42:54.836, Speaker A: In the end, everything turned out fine. But prior to that happening, there was a huge discussion within the blast community, encrypted Twitter as a whole of whether or not blast should roll back the chain to before the hack. And you basically had two camps. One would argue you should never compromise the bridge or roll back the chain at all because you remove all credibility, any pretense of decentralizations out the window. But you retain user funds. On the other hand, you have, like, the other camp that saw, okay, you have a bunch of huge investors that are bought into the ecosystem. Obviously, you need to get their money back so they can continue to stimulate growth.
00:42:54.836 - 00:43:26.696, Speaker A: And obviously, like, the decentralization, decentralization theater is just that. It's theater like, every sophisticated actor using blast already knows that it's not decentralized whatsoever. It's governed by a small, multisig, et cetera. So you're not really saving anything. You might as well get the money back, etcetera. And I definitely saw a lot of points from both camps. If you're asking me, like, I definitely think they, at least at the time, should have rolled back the chain.
00:43:26.696 - 00:43:56.974, Speaker A: Like, that should have been the move if they were choosing between these two options simply based on the fact that, yeah, like, again, the decentralization theater doesn't really matter. Like, what really matters is the users, that you retain them, and you might lose some credibility on that front, but if you don't get the funds back, you lose credibility on making sure your users are whole and okay, etcetera. So I don't know if you guys have any views on this situation or blast as a whole.
00:43:59.334 - 00:44:38.942, Speaker C: I saw some good takes on this on Twitter last week, and I think that it can basically be summarized with, you don't want to fund North Korea's missile program. And I know, like, people were talking at one point about maybe this was like, a actual, like, a french citizen. So I don't know, actually, if it was proven to be a North Korean. But with that being said, like, like, Pac man would probably be held liable directly in court for, like, funding North Korea. So I really don't think this was ever actually a conversation. I think at the end of the day, this chain was getting rolled back if the keys weren't recovered. So I'm glad to see the keys are recovered and we didn't actually have to see this get played out, to be completely honest.
00:44:38.942 - 00:44:42.874, Speaker C: But with that being said, I think we all know how this would have gone had it not.
00:44:46.254 - 00:45:15.560, Speaker D: I just can't take anything that's launching on blast seriously, to be honest. Like, that's really my overall take. And it's not even just blast to, it's like the newest amm that launched on D gen chain over the weekend. It's like, I'm not touching that with a ten foot pole. Like, maybe I'll, like, throw, like, a couple bucks in and try to gamble, but, I mean, people that are willing to throw, like, risk caution to the wind and just, like, ape into something without really knowing what. What it is, I guess it kind of is the market right now. It's like a first, ask questions later.
00:45:15.560 - 00:45:54.270, Speaker D: And I can definitely sympathize with that. I've done that a little bit myself. But I think as it refers to blast, like, why? Why are you building there? What are you doing? Like, there's so many other good opportunities. If you're actually a true builder that cares about distribution of your product, you'd be launching on base optimism or arbitrum today. Like, there's really no other option. I think if you're building on blast, I think you're doing it for the clout and for a get rich quick scheme. So I, you know, not to shit on developers that are truly trying to build unique, innovative products on blast, but it's like, I, I'm never going to be using your product just for, like, the location that you're building your application on.
00:45:54.270 - 00:45:59.314, Speaker D: That's my personal take and, yeah, that's really how I feel.
00:46:00.174 - 00:46:05.794, Speaker C: I'll be excited to get a renewed take after that. Token launches. I bet that narrative changes drastically.
00:46:08.934 - 00:46:16.814, Speaker D: It'll be a hated rally for sure. Like, it'll pump my face. I'm still not going to touch it. But yeah, yeah.
00:46:16.854 - 00:47:06.170, Speaker A: Blast has been, in terms of what was expected, like one of the worst launches of l two s because there's seemingly a big rug every day of the first week of the chain launching. And I think we had a lot of takes before launch of they were able to attract so much capital and we're giving them props. And if you're a developer, you obviously want to see traction before you build anywhere. And with that, you're probably going to attract good developers. But I think in hindsight, like, looking back, I think a lot of the builders that were enticed by the big numbers were like, opportunists and people looking to exploit as opposed to people looking to actually build good products. And, yeah, color me shocked. Yeah.
00:47:06.170 - 00:47:54.642, Speaker A: I mean, obviously in hindsight it looks pretty obvious. And I tried to warn that, like, like, developers are going to see that number and you're going to see a lot of rugs, et cetera. I didn't think there'd be the amount that there was or basically every big token ended up rugging. But, yeah, I mean, like Sam said, once the token launches and the fact that we've sort of gotten all the, I guess the bad news and bad actors out of the way, that blast may start to come into its own. You're going to start to see the developers that are here for the long term stick around and there's still a bunch of capital over there ready to play with applications. They're a little more cautious now and ready to play with apps they can actually use. So hopefully we see it come back from blast, especially as the token launches.
00:47:54.642 - 00:48:01.450, Speaker A: But again, with effort. I'm not touching that stuff until I see some confirmation of good stuff going on.
00:48:01.642 - 00:48:46.834, Speaker B: To be honest, I think that they're getting a bit too much shit, actually. Like, if you think about the early days of like, ethereum, like, there had to be like so many like, nine fake bugs. Unlike even Solana today, there's probably like five tokens being launched a second that are like immediately rugged for like a few k here and there. I don't think, like, it's any different from, like, in any other, like, blockchain today. They're just getting a lot of spotlight because they launched, like, the whole, like, you know, like we're like a casino sort of like marketing and that's where their branding came from. But, you know, like, every other ecosystem will have like a huge amount of bugs, especially in the early day. And like, as far as, like, the trust assumptions for blast itself, like, it really isn't that different from like half of the l two s out there today.
00:48:46.834 - 00:48:55.314, Speaker B: But obviously, like, if you're bridging into blast, like, you should know like, kind of what you're bridging into. Whereas for like, other chains, like a slightly more like, obfuscated.
00:48:56.214 - 00:49:31.144, Speaker C: Yeah, and like, on that topic, like, if. If I was someone looking to do like a malicious protocol slash, like token launch and like, rug people, like, I'd be going to base. Everyone is signing anything over there. Like everyone's on forecast or just minting different stuff. Like, no one's looking or thinking twice. There's a million things to do and it's actually a lot of fun to go play over there. But I just kind of wonder if that centralized sequence are operated by a us entity really is kind of what's keeping people away because as we just discussed, we think they would have rolled back the chain if need be or at least gated funds from exiting the bridge.
00:49:35.064 - 00:49:41.724, Speaker B: But all right, enough about blast. Last but not least, effort capital. Who you got on the hot sequel throne?
00:49:42.544 - 00:50:14.452, Speaker D: Yeah, I actually think I put it on the hot seat like month or so ago at. At the peak price, but bit tensor is on the hot seat. So it's about. It's down about 40% from all time highs. Granted, rest of the market is down like decent amount depending on, you know, I guess overall markets, most things are down 1020 percent ish specifically over the past week, but potentially took like a pretty hard fall. I'm just going to repeat what I said last time, which is I still think I've read every single paper out there. By no means.
00:50:14.452 - 00:50:38.902, Speaker D: I'm, you know, my, an AI expert. I. Far from it. I'm still trying to learn like all about like the entire space. But I just collectively, I keep thinking like it's all just mumbo jumbo. I read every single document out there. I've read people's understanding of what bitten sir and how Tao works and its distribution mechanism, of its inflation to generate better inference and better training and pre training of models.
00:50:38.902 - 00:51:11.152, Speaker D: It's going to eat the world. It's going to be OpenAI at its own game. And I'm just convinced that nobody knows how it works and that it's really just an AI narrative on top of ve tokenomics. I know they're trying to create like a new dynamic Tao like token model that changes how it distributes tao inflation. But I still think it's like a fundamentally broken mechanism. The reason why it's really on the hottest. I think it's not just the price action, but Eric Wall posted this really lengthy bear post effectively saying it should go to zero.
00:51:11.152 - 00:52:03.404, Speaker D: It's a bunch of hot garbage. It's really like there's nothing AI or there's no, like, you know, magic dust that Bittenster does specifically like this decentralized AI narrative pretty much called like 1000 x less efficient chat GPT bot, which is specifically from one of the largest subnets, I think, subnet one on tensor. And he really summarized it like, it doesn't really necessarily necessarily incentivize competition or optimize model output. It's effectively just like incentivizing people to come up with the exact same responses and really copy one another's responses. And it's really effectively like it's a wrapper on top of OpenAI and chat GPT and like other open source models out there. I mean, that's really like the only thing I really wanted to talk about it. I think in general, that doesn't mean to say, like, it's not gonna hit all time highs again.
00:52:03.404 - 00:52:25.546, Speaker D: I'm sure it will. I do think that decentralized AI narratives till really early on. Obviously this is not financial advice. It is still like considered one of like the blue chip AI tokens. I think. I'm really excited to see ritual and other AI related plays like launch and become liquid assets to trade in the coming quarters. But I'm personally very bearish on bitten, sir.
00:52:25.546 - 00:53:34.256, Speaker D: In the long run, I really just think it's paying out like one point five to two billion dollars a year at this point in new tokens. And now you got to ask yourself, like, at a 10 billion FTV or whatever it is now, is there actually going to be net demand for this bit? Tensor bulls will say there is because there's huge demand to, to grow new sub or build new subnet architecture. But, like, if you listen to those are Twitter spaces that Martin Shkreli hosted over the weekend, or I think might have actually been Friday, Const, who's the founder of Bittenster, came on to try to explain to Martin, who's also a pretty big, like, bittensor bear, I guess you could say explain like, why Bittenster is better, why Martin, who's actually building a AI startup, supposedly, like, why he should leverage Bittensor to like lower his operating cost of fine tune and train and like provide inference for his model. And to me, and I think to a lot of other people in the spaces, it was really just like, again, a bunch of mumbo jumbo that really did make sense. It went over a lot of people's heads. I'm just, you know, I'm not bearish on decentralized AI, far from it. I just don't think that bittenter is anything that's cracked up to be.
00:53:34.256 - 00:54:03.294, Speaker D: But again, I'm sure the narrative will stick and it'll still do well. But it was really interesting seeing like a lot of non web, three focused VC's kind of jump on the bandwagon to this AI narrative. Probably because they missed Nvidia and then they saw crypto being like, this high beta play on traditional equities and they like, the first thing they jumped into was like, bitten. So how Tal is going to revolutionize the world, but I don't even think they fully understand what it does. So, yeah, that's my hot seat.
00:54:04.554 - 00:54:53.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, likewise, I'm not going to pretend to be an AI expert, very, very far from it. I know, like, the correct words to say, to sound smart to say like, verifiable inference, provenance and like, ZKMl. And you sound like you really know your shit in AI. I mean, like, I do think in the end state that there is a lot of like, utility in building, like, AI systems on, like, distributed, like, blockchains. But there are also some projects which I did not need to be a bit tender subnet. And you see them like, say, hey, we're going to launch a bit tension subject and it's pretty obvious that the financial incentives are there. Like, I don't really blame anyone for trying to make money, but did it really need to be a bitten to subnet for like some of these data subnets? Probably not, but yeah, I mean, like long term, I'm still like a crypto ex AI bull.
00:54:56.144 - 00:55:09.908, Speaker A: Okay, now it's my turn to larp as an AI expert. So the way that a lot of these models, like learn or get better is through like reinforcement learn. Like, I forget the, the term for.
00:55:09.956 - 00:55:12.420, Speaker D: It, but basically rlHf.
00:55:12.612 - 00:55:15.184, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Rlhf.
00:55:15.844 - 00:55:17.664, Speaker D: We're all Larkin today. I love it.
00:55:18.004 - 00:56:39.684, Speaker A: It's great where basically you have humans come in and say whether a response was good, bad, etcetera, and you actually give it feedback. And the way that bittensor tries to do this is in a decentralized way where you have each basically validator run their own LLM and how close they are to the response. They either get like positive or negative feedback, I believe, in the form of rewards. And that model is obviously like way less performant than the other one because basically what you're incentivizing is for each validator to be as close to the average, what they think everyone else is going to say, not what the actual real response is. Because if they give the real response and everyone else gives some sort of response that's adjacent, well, then they're going to get penalized. So it's not the right, basically incentive mechanism to actually have RLHF type models where you're actually learning and getting better. So that's the one thing I do know about Bittensor and that, like, it's underperforming in that way, but I don't know enough to talk about like, other subnets, like what's going on on the cutting edge and weather that compete with open source, but on that specific metric, like, I'm definitely a bear, but I need to learn more for sure.
00:56:40.664 - 00:57:29.314, Speaker D: Speaking about RLHF, we've said that acronym a lot already in the past five minutes, but Ryan Connor, new blockers research analyst, ordered like a banger report on Hivemapper and so that it kind of is like an AI adjacent play because they use RLHF to optimize, I guess, how the camera is able to map certain street signs and what have you. So really good report. Hopefully blockers use subscribers already seen it. If you haven't read it but want to read like, probably the best report on Highmapper in the space, suggest you subscribe. Ryan is going to be like our deepen and AI expert for the foreseeable future. So I'm really excited to see what content he puts out, but really never thought of it like that. Because I vaguely understand how Hivemapper worked prior to that, but seeing his report kind of opened up my eyes, like the potential of what they're trying to achieve.
00:57:30.574 - 00:57:44.158, Speaker C: Yep. Big agree on that. I read the report, edited it. It's very good. Highly recommend you check it out. On top of that, we have a podcast coming out next Thursday with ritual, which is an AI project. It's really interesting, actually.
00:57:44.158 - 00:58:01.606, Speaker C: I'm like an AI skeptic. So I'm going to save you guys the, the, I guess, spiel on bit tensor specifically because I think I've given it here before, but nonetheless, stay tuned for that one coming out next week. But I think that's a good spot to stop. Ren, unless you have anything else. Nope, not a. All right, westy effort. Thanks for coming on.
00:58:01.606 - 00:58:02.854, Speaker C: We will see you here next week.
