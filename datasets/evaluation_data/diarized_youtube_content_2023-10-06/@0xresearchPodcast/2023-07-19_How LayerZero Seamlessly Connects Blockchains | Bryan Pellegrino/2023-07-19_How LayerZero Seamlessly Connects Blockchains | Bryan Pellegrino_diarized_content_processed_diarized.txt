00:00:00.330 - 00:00:14.080, Speaker A: We don't really care if it's a thousand orthogonal layer ones or ethereum, only as a settlement layer and a thousand layer twos. Like you're still going to need to move state data between those. We just try to build the primitive that makes it as easy as possible for both of those.
00:00:16.530 - 00:00:58.378, Speaker B: What's up everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research, brought to you by the atom accelerator. If you're a developer looking for a home in the industry, the atom Economic zone welcomes you. You're going to hear more about the atom accelerator a little bit later in the show. Today is July 17 and we have a great interview lined up with Brian Pellegrino, the co founder and CEO of Layer Zero Labs. And I also wanted to take a second to spread a promo for the permissionless event that we'll be hosting in Austin, Texas. It is the largest D five encrypted conference bringing builders, researchers and investors and thought leaders all into one place in the heart of Austin, Texas. If you use code Zero X 30, you can get a 30% discount on your code and we will see you on September 11 through 13th.
00:00:58.378 - 00:01:15.554, Speaker B: If you do decide to come, be sure to hop in our DMs on Twitter. Hit us up on Telegram, let us know and let's grab a beer. But before we get into the interview, as always, we are joined by Ren and effort Capital, two members from the blockworks research team to discuss the latest market happenings. Effort, why don't I kick it over to you for your hot seat or cool throwing to kick us off?
00:01:15.592 - 00:01:44.074, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, I think I'm going to start off with a hot seat today. I'm going to throw all alt EVM L ones and proof of stake Ethereum side chains on the hot seat. So this past week, and I think I had them on a hot seat a couple of weeks ago, but Polygon officially announced what they're going to be doing with their token rebrand. This is their second rebrand. So if you remember back in 2017, 2018, it was originally just called Matic Network. They rebranded to Polygon, but the token was still called matic.
00:01:44.074 - 00:02:37.454, Speaker C: Now, on top of this whole architecture revamp and new token design, they're now going to rename their matic token Paul P o l after the Polygon brand. And what they're planning on doing is, I think rebundling the entire modular stack, data availability, execution, you name it, under one asset, they're increasing their token supply. So they kind of tried to reframe that. They're doing a one to one token swap from Maddox to poll. But they also kind of hid inside the T's and C's. The actual wording of their rebrand that they're increasing their max supply from 10 billion to now include a 1% inflation that's going to go towards paying validators and potentially like an ecosystem incentivization fund. But this really just sounds like they're just a lot of zk buzwords, a lot of infrastructure buzzwords, really.
00:02:37.454 - 00:03:32.042, Speaker C: At the end of the day, everyone in the space just wants to see polygon have legitimate usage, they have a lot of enterprise partnerships. But I'd be lying if I said I've used Polygon to do anything over the past like year or two outside of lens. But on top of that, you also saw Celo on their research forums, announce that they plan on migrating from their own sovereign evM based l one to become now an l two in the hopes of, I guess, joining this narrative of l two s being the next wave of ecosystem and on chain adoption. But let's not act like anyone actually cares. There's like $100 million of TVL on sello the past 24 hours. They've gotten $200 worth of transaction fees. If you haven't found product market fit as a sovereign l one, you're definitely not going to find product market fit as an L two s, where you're going to probably see hundreds of l two s kind of pop up over the next couple of years to try to catch this narrative.
00:03:32.042 - 00:03:53.842, Speaker C: And overall, I think all these rebrands, all these new architectures try to realign themselves with Ethereum isn't going to change much at the end of the day. Again, we just want to see some on chain applications that people actually want to use. And we're kind of still in this hype cycle of architecture, of infrastructure that I'm hoping is kind of dying down over this next cycle.
00:03:53.906 - 00:04:49.350, Speaker D: I want to dive in on that last point you made on the silo green chain. It is kind of interesting that they made this move from their own alt l one to an ethereum based l two. This is kind of something that we talked about when ETH l two s were still in their infancy and starting to see, okay, these might actually be interesting. There was this huge idea around not necessarily a narrative, but more of just like people talking like, oh, one day all these, all l ones are going to end up as Ethel two s. And now we're seeing some of the lower end ones make that transition, be like, you know, what doesn't make sense for us to try to run our validator network. Let's just go be an ethel two and kind of just take things from there, which is pretty interesting, right? Because there's an interesting. I haven't really seen any research around this, but the idea of using your own native token to incentivize validation of your alt l one is a cost to your network, and it can be viewed as such.
00:04:49.350 - 00:05:23.410, Speaker D: And if you're an ETH L two, like arbitram or optimism, you don't have to incentivize the sequencing of your chain. That's kind of just like this off chain expense. So there's like a trade off there. There is still an expense associated with that, but certainly less than emitting millions of dollars of your own native token out. So pretty cool trade off between the two things of the different costs there. And I think the real takeaway there for me is there is this mind share of attention and value and use flowing back to Ethereum. This was like in the early days of the bear market.
00:05:23.410 - 00:05:55.146, Speaker D: Everyone was like, everything's going to consolidate around Ethereum. It's going to happen right now. Go. And obviously it didn't happen overnight, but we are seeing some true signs of that narrative actually coming to life. Now, that doesn't mean alt chains are necessarily dead, but we've seen some action on Solana and other ecosystems are still bustling like the cosmos, for example. So, yeah, just kind of interesting to actually see the narrative of people and attention and mind share and activity center back around Ethereum.
00:05:55.338 - 00:06:41.510, Speaker C: Yeah. Just to add to this, I think coming from the cosmos ecosystem, it's going to be really interesting. You're seeing them converge on the same path. So a bunch of alt EVML ones are now converging back to Ethereum as like, the home base to hopefully get liquidity from. And the exact same thing is now happening with the cosmos ecosystem, where replicated security, you see stride migrating from their own sovereign chain to now become a replicated secure chain. On the Cosmos hub, you're seeing UMI and a couple other Cosmos sovereign chains potentially joining the ranks and becoming a secured chain to the hub, one to offload validator costs, but also to get atom liquidity. I think it's also kind of interesting because these l two s, I think the Ethereum community likes to kind of hand wave away the cost of running a sequencer.
00:06:41.510 - 00:07:18.598, Speaker C: It's very easy to run a sequencer at little to no cost when centralized. The moment you start decentralized a sequencer, now you have to start incentivizing a decentralized validator set. Sounds like an app chain to me. You also have to now like Silo Green chain is also going to be leveraging eigenda for data availability. If you're a restaked ETH validator for Eigen layer. Now you have to go secure chain to provide data availability. How is cello going to pay for that? Probably by incentivizing Eigen da e three stakers.
00:07:18.598 - 00:07:44.546, Speaker C: Again, sounds like more overhead. And it sounds like you're actually getting rid of your sovereignty by giving offloading other parts of the modular stack to other chains. But there is a cost of doing so. And really, at the end of the day, I really think everything in the L two space is just going to revert back to looking like a cosmos app chain. Obviously it's my personal point of view from my biased lens, but I'm really not seeing a lot of differences here.
00:07:44.648 - 00:08:05.698, Speaker D: I would like to make a formal proposal to the blockworks research dow to do some digging around the cost of being your own l one and incentivizing security through your validator set versus being an L two and using a DA layer and having a sequencer and working towards decentralizing that. That'd be a really cool analysis.
00:08:05.874 - 00:08:06.502, Speaker C: Great.
00:08:06.636 - 00:08:46.494, Speaker B: Yeah, that would be super cool. Especially considering when you're running off a centralized sequencer. Yes, you're paying rent to Ethereum, but you're not paying it out of your own native tokens treasury or like token allocation I guess, but instead you're making the user pay for that l one settlement cost. So that would be a super interesting report, but hate to break it to the effort. I think you're going to be wanting to put Alt L ones and other side chains in the hot seat for a while because we've got avo mantle, we've got base, we've got worldcoin and silo green chain. Now we've got Paul. I feel like this is not going to stop, especially with arbitram's kind of full stack initiative as well as ZK Stack.
00:08:46.494 - 00:08:50.200, Speaker B: So, hate to say it, I think you're going to be stuck in this camp for a while.
00:08:50.810 - 00:08:51.814, Speaker C: I will be.
00:08:51.932 - 00:09:07.290, Speaker D: We haven't even seen the heat of the ZK stuff really come to life yet. I think we're in the very early innings of that. So super excited once these chains actually have out of the box interoperability, which I know you preach about all the time with IBC.
00:09:08.030 - 00:09:54.646, Speaker E: Yeah, just briefly touching on know they say that it's a marketing buzword that Poo is a hyperproductive token and that you can use it to validate multiple chains. And chains can offer multiple roles. I don't know what those multiple roles are. But for example, it could be validating sequencing, data availability, something. But it does feel like that's becoming a trend. And it really does feel like restaking is becoming inevitable, right? Not just on Ethereum using eigen layer, but also using other chains. So it seems like there's like a set of concerns around restaking that people haven't really considered.
00:09:54.646 - 00:10:42.286, Speaker E: Like how many consensus or validator clients can an e validator really run at the same time if they're restaking with Eigen layer? I feel like that's questions that people haven't asked and just like how we're come to terms with centralized builders, right? And for example in the crosschain for future with Saave or intense or whatever you believe in, it does feel like that there's going to be these massive entities that are building all of the blocks and they're going to be centralized. And it does feel like we may be running into a future like this with sort of restaking or hyperproductive tokens where one validator or one computer has to validate for so many things at the same time. So I think that's just an interesting point to think about, Bren.
00:10:42.338 - 00:10:46.902, Speaker B: You want to kick it off with your, or not kick it off, but you want to share your hot seat of coolthrown.
00:10:47.046 - 00:11:18.230, Speaker E: Yeah, I got ripple on the couthrone. Obviously they contributed to a massive move in the overall crypto market across last week. So basically what happened was that a judge ruled that XRP is not a security. However, there are some caveats here. The sales to institutions of XRP does count as a security. However, the ripple sales of XRP do not constitute an offer of investment contracts. And so an offer of investment contract is separate from a security.
00:11:18.230 - 00:11:54.666, Speaker E: Those are two different things. And programmatic sales on for example like a centralized exchange, also do not count as a security because you don't know who you're selling to, whether it's like a protocol, the exchange or market maker, and you don't really know where your money is going to. There's like a lot of caveats here. I think the general gist that XRP itself is just a token. A token isn't like anything. A token is a token, but it really depends on how you sell that token, like what you offer to your investors. What type of marketing language are you promising returns.
00:11:54.666 - 00:12:36.510, Speaker E: That really makes you the security. And obviously, as we all know, being a security is not that great of a thing because it means there are like a million different laws that you have to abide to. You have to register for exemptions, blah, blah, blah. But I think there are a few key winnies here, right? One key winner is centralized exchanges because they are likely the place where protocols will come and offer those programmatic sales. And I would guess that if you're a protocol team, you would probably want to do a protocol sales to verify like KYC user base rather than doing it on a Dex. But that's just my guess. For all we know, these may happen on Dexes more than centralized exchanges.
00:12:36.510 - 00:13:29.610, Speaker E: Similarly, protocols, obviously regulatory clarity is fantastic. I feel like a lot of devs now have a better idea of what they should do and what they shouldn't do when issuing a token. And one large group that I think is a really big winner here is that users, right. If you don't want to sell it to institutions, because it means that you have to classify your token, or at least like that specific contract, as a security, then perhaps you want to do more public raises through community fundraising efforts, you want to do more airdrops, you want to give users away to basically get more of their protocol tokens. And it feels like those are the three big buckets that have sort of won from this judge ruling. And obviously Coinbase is one of the big winners. But I'll let effort capital talk a bit more about that coin.
00:13:29.690 - 00:13:33.810, Speaker C: Good stock, honestly, really good equity. It was up 24%.
00:13:33.880 - 00:13:34.958, Speaker D: Not financial advice.
00:13:35.054 - 00:14:12.670, Speaker C: Not financial advice. I was at one point uncomfortably long coin. Now I'm comfortably long coin after the move, Brian, and Coinbase is unhinged right now. After this news, they immediately relisted XRP for trading. Obviously the market liked this news because it means that a lot of this potential securities are, at least in the eyes of the SEC. The SEC is probably going to lose those future lawsuits against Adam Salana, Matic, et cetera. So I'm going to probably get this wrong, but I want to say like 30 ish to 45% of all of Coinbase's trade volume is from alts, non non bitcoin and ETH related alts.
00:14:12.670 - 00:14:56.374, Speaker C: So obviously, prior to the XRP news, there was a lot of concern around Coinbase's future revenue stream in the event that these assets are considered securities. But if XRP is not a security, there's no way, like half of these are, 99% of these assets are. So this is really good news for the market around Coinbase. You're going to probably see their trade volumes sustain, if not go higher, in the event of an impending bull market. But really good news for Coinbase as a whole. You're seeing, obviously their competitors, mostly binance, get their hand slapped in the know. You're seeing different regulatory bodies throughout the EU and even in other parts of the world, start kind of cracking down on binance.
00:14:56.374 - 00:16:04.030, Speaker C: You're seeing a lot of fud on binance right now, either right or wrong, not sure, because they're kind of not fully transparent around their assets and around how their revenues are shaking out, but they just laid off over a thousand employees over the weekend. But currently you're seeing Coinbase's story turn more bullish while you're seeing their competitors kind of, I guess, wither away a little bit, right in the news of the bitcoin ETF and all these major traditional financial institutions leveraging Coinbase for their exchange surveillance agreements, leveraging Coinbase as a custody provider, the entire Coinbase narrative is finally coming to fruition. The whole bet was that if you believe crypto is here to stay, then you have to imagine there's going to be certain clear regulatory guidelines around crypto as an asset class. And you're starting to see that, at least in the United States. And the more regulatory clarity we get, the more bullish Coinbase is as an entity, because they really played by the book for the past twelve plus years. People forget that Coinbase has been around since day one. And if you're bullish on crypto, you have to inevitably be bullish on Coinbase.
00:16:04.030 - 00:16:37.260, Speaker C: They got lucky that FTX blew up because FTX is making a really big brand and name recognition in the United States. And they lucked out because of that. Because if not, if FTX was a legitimate company and Sam Bankman Fried and those actors weren't being greedy, there was a good chance that FTX us was going to become the dominant exchange in the United States and the dominant american crypto. You know, the cards fell where they lied. And ultimately, Coinbase is coming out ahead, and they have a really good story ahead from here, as long as they don't mess up.
00:16:38.990 - 00:17:16.498, Speaker D: Whenever it comes to legal stuff like this. I am just so dumb. This stuff goes so far over my head, unfortunately. So I definitely am a person when it comes to legal stuff again, that I'm looking to other people for thoughts. And while all of CT was kind of hooting and hollering out of joy, I got to give a shout out to the blockworks editorial team, they were like, all right, hold on. What does this actually mean? And while there were some great things, it's also still like, okay, we won round one, but this is far from over. And one of the interesting things is ripple didn't even win the suit for the reasons that they were suing.
00:17:16.498 - 00:18:03.286, Speaker D: The judge. Kind of came out was like, I don't agree with why you're saying you're not a security, but here's why you're probably not a security. And there's a quote from an article that Casey Wagner wrote that I want to read here. And so this is a quote from Joe Castellucio, a partner at Mayor Brown and the leader of the firm's fintech and digital assets group. So as one of the few successful challenges to the SEC in this area, the decision provides a window into additional structuring possibilities for token insurances and secondary market transactions. However, I don't think this decision deeters the SEC or causes it to change its approach to the industry. So still expect the SEC to continue on the way.
00:18:03.286 - 00:18:34.610, Speaker D: They've been on this war path. It'll be interesting to see if they go after, you know, this has to be kind of like an arrow to the knee for the SEC, but I kind of agree. They've already made it their brand to go after crypto, for better or for worse. And I don't think losing the first round is going to kind of push them off the hill. So it's just a bit of the insight from the other side of the perspective here, because all over crypto, Twitter, it was, we won, we won, we won. And all over the charts it said, we won, we won, we won as well. So kind of interesting.
00:18:34.610 - 00:18:44.820, Speaker D: And again, I don't pretend to know the law, so it's just interesting to see the other side of the wall here.
00:18:45.830 - 00:19:03.740, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. Honestly, I'm with you there, Dan. I'm like, I don't try and act like I know the legal jargon, but I ain't shorting XRP with a ten foot pole. Some people are trying to play that game and I don't know, you're just one headline away from just getting wrecked in either direction. I'm going to steer clear of that market for a while.
00:19:04.590 - 00:19:32.206, Speaker D: Yeah, they still have the retail attention, which is coming back. I've got a very embarrassing text from my mother saying she wants to get me to host a women's crypto group for the neighborhood. So retail is coming back. And the answer to that text was no. Let the record state, but one of my good budies dads got wrecked in blockfi. Still pursuing on is like, no, I get the crypto. Uh, he's always asking me about ripple and stellar.
00:19:32.206 - 00:19:40.120, Speaker D: Those are the two always asking me. And I'm like, that's where retail attention is. I don't know how it always shifts there, but that is what this group is looking at.
00:19:41.610 - 00:20:07.114, Speaker B: Yeah, you just reminded me of the FTX claims process. I've been seeing people all over Twitter saying I made a claim, but I haven't gotten an email or anything telling me that I made the claim and I don't have any money still. So we probably should have put them on the hot seat. But instead, actually for my hot seat, I can jump into that. I've got ave companies, they launched go. I believe it was late last week, maybe over the weekend or I can't actually recall.
00:20:07.162 - 00:20:12.234, Speaker D: Dan, I'll have you officially pushed live on Saturday. Yeah. So what's that, the 15th?
00:20:12.362 - 00:20:12.606, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:12.628 - 00:20:51.898, Speaker B: Okay, so I've been live for two days. There's about two and a half million borrowed, I believe at around one and a half percent. Reason we've kind of got them in the hot seat here is just the valuation. They're sitting at like a 1.2 million billion dollar FDV versus curve's 700 billion would be pretty large. As well as makers 950,000,000 FDV or so. And then they also launched lens V two or I don't know if it's actually launched quite yet officially, but plans for V two rolled out earlier today, basically making nfts composable with the ERC six five one standard under lens v two.
00:20:51.898 - 00:21:44.160, Speaker B: So basically specific NFTs can have their own lens profile. So the example they gave in the Twitter thread that they put out was that a crypto kitty could have its own lens profile, kind of creating its own value flow for the actual NFT brand, while kind of creating value for the content creator who owns the NFT themselves. And they also introduce open actions, which is basically the ability to interact with smart contracts via lens publications, which is actually pretty cool. It opens the door for lens users to mint NFTs, swap ERC 20s, participate in dows directly via user interfaces on lens. And some other improvements include some security upgrades, the ability to transfer handles without actually transferring the entire profile. So they're kind of split up into two different NFTs now. I don't know, I just kind of got them on the hot seat because one, I think Aave is overvalued relative to its peers with better products.
00:21:44.160 - 00:22:08.360, Speaker B: And I also think that decentralized social is just generally really far out. It's just not a smooth experience today. And I don't think that people are actually going to migrate from Twitter threads. I don't know why I listed threads there. No one's actually using that right now either. But nonetheless, other major social media web two companies, I don't see that being replaced by web three for a significant amount of time.
00:22:09.930 - 00:22:44.770, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. Just going to the lens v two take. Humans are inherently social creatures and we want to be social with other people that are also on the same platform and like threads. Great example. I just look, I haven't threaded anything in over a week and that's a centralized company backed by the largest social media platform in the world. And I'm going to stay on Twitter because that's where everyone that I interact with is on. And until there's like a real market product differentiator to go to lens like, here's why.
00:22:44.770 - 00:23:15.382, Speaker C: And look, I'm super bullish. Crypto decentralization and ownership of a social graph is not enough of a reason for me to move right now. It just isn't. I have trouble seeing what the tangible benefits of that are and I'm already within this niche sector. So yeah, I think it's really cool that they're trying to push this forward. I do think at one point decentralized social is probably going to be a good narrative in the coming years. I just think it's probably too early and just to put them on the hot seat.
00:23:15.382 - 00:23:46.078, Speaker C: I agree. From a product perspective, if you look at Maker, so maker is obviously going through their whole end game revision or revamp. They forked Ave v three to create spark protocol. I know zero X research interviewed Sam as part of that, who's kind of heading Phoenix labs and building out spark protocol. But when you look at like a maker dow to ave comparison, it's essentially the same product at this point. Maker Dow has a decentralized stablecoin. It's the most Lindy stablecoin in crypto.
00:23:46.078 - 00:24:19.870, Speaker C: Maker has been around since 2016. Obviously they now own their own lending platform, which is literally an Ave V three fork. They're going to be able to lend out die at the cheapest rate possible across the market. They're sitting at 900 million FDV. And then you look at Ave sitting at 1.2 billion FDV, they have go, it's brand new. Yes, they have higher TVL, but if you look at like Maker versus Ave Maker has much more, I guess, brand awareness in the tradfi space.
00:24:19.870 - 00:25:09.054, Speaker C: So they're being leveraged by community banks in the United States, they're being leveraged by SocGen in France, which is one of the largest institutional banks in the world, I believe, and at least in the EU, is actually like tapping into dialquidity makers sitting on over a billion dollars in USDC that they're able to leverage to deposit into T bills. And they're going to be, I think, profiting over $100 million, like profit over $100 million on an annualized basis by sometime next year, once all their RWA deals reach max debt ceiling. It's just really hard to stomach investing in Ave over maker at this point because maker is kind of building out and expanding or doing like horizontal integration. And Ave is kind of playing catch up.
00:25:09.252 - 00:25:18.398, Speaker B: And for the record, effort capital thinks MKR will be a top ten asset by market cap in the next few years. So just take everything he said with a grain of salt.
00:25:18.494 - 00:25:36.840, Speaker C: And I'll also say I don't own any MKR, so I don't own any right now. I probably should have because they're up like 100% or close to it since I was bull posting at the bottom. But yeah, that was me larping. But I do seriously do think MKR is like a very undervalued DFI asset relative to the space.
00:25:37.610 - 00:25:45.450, Speaker D: Let's get this on the record. So you said by 2025, is that Jan one or December 26, 31st?
00:25:45.600 - 00:25:51.214, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll say by the end of 2025 you're going to say MKr in the top ten.
00:25:51.412 - 00:25:57.854, Speaker D: All right, so what's that, 24 months? No, 30 months. All right, mark it down. We'll be back in 30 months.
00:25:57.972 - 00:25:59.470, Speaker C: Remember I keep receipts.
00:26:00.130 - 00:26:27.378, Speaker D: Okay, perfect. And yeah, I agree with the takes around decentralized social. And I think that perfectly sums up if Zuck struggles to do it, it's going to be hard for a decentralized startup to do it as well. So when comparing go to Dai, I tend to agree with your points there. And the Lindy effect is actually quite huge. You really see that playing out in the market. Dai really has never been challenged.
00:26:27.378 - 00:26:54.240, Speaker D: Frax got fairly close and then once the bear market hit, you saw a true pullback. Nobody was holding fracs for its spot demand, if you will, or just to have an asset that holds value, a stable value, specifically. Well, people use that for Dai. Dai is in treasuries of protocols. It does very much so have that effect. And when comparing it to curve. There's a couple of things that I think curve just nailed with its new model.
00:26:54.240 - 00:28:09.622, Speaker D: So, like, both go and Dai CrvusD uses that peer to protocol model where you don't necessarily interact with your peer to peers, which is a very outdated model at this point. What's more common is a peer to pool, where you have suppliers who deposit assets that lenders come and borrow from the protocol, or, excuse me, borrowers would borrow from the protocol, and that's been a great model that's scaled. DeFi really, I mean, ave compound really led the charge there. That's why DeFi is the way it is today. But from a profitability standpoint, that's just not a great way to run a business. If you have to pay borrowers to bring assets to your protocol to fund new loans, you're just going to have to cut that spread between what borrowers are paying in interest, and that ultimately flows back to lenders to incentivize them to bring their capital to the table, where if you can play the role of the lender and have the stablecoin that gets borrowed, you can capture the entire amount of interest that flows in from the borrowers, and that is simply a more profitable model. You saw Dai really be the first ones to take this and run with it, and now you're seeing ave migrate into this peer to protocol model.
00:28:09.622 - 00:29:03.894, Speaker D: And that's how curve is launching its stablecoin, which is now up to about 100 million in borrow outstanding. And they have two key innovations on the peer to protocol model. So instead of just borrowing from like a plain vault or a dumb vault or whatever you want to call it, you're actually borrowing from an AMM curve, which is a very interesting brand new innovation that we've seen in the space. And what this enables is instead of getting a hard liquidation at a certain point, so let's say you borrowed $1,000 at 80% LTV. Then once you hit that health factor of one or zero, however you're calculating it, and when you're up for liquidation, you lose everything. At that point, instead of going that model, there's actually this collateral conversion model, if you will. So as the price of your collateral kind of falls down and decreases, you're gradually moving from the volatile collateral asset into a stable collateral asset.
00:29:03.894 - 00:29:24.182, Speaker D: So you're always going to have more value than your borrow outstanding. So it's a brand new model. It's been working great in production. There's been very few hard liquidations. I can only think of one. But I'm sure there's probably somewhere between one and five at this point. And so we're seeing a better environment for borrowers to go access capital.
00:29:24.182 - 00:30:31.586, Speaker D: And another interesting thing here, which is some would argue is the larger innovation is a dynamic interest rate curve that updates based on market conditions without user intervention. And what this leads to is less governance, and that is always a net positive when you can have a safe and secure model that doesn't need to be updated with user interventions. Ultimately that is what we're trying to build in DeFi is just autonomous financial applications, and this is actually pushing that direction. So again, two massive innovations and quick little intro on the dynamic interest rate model is the two key ingredients into this model are the current price of CRV USD, the stablecoin and the amount of debt in the system. And basically based on how those values shift, the interest rates that users are borrowing at will kind of shift the rates that users are paying. So we've seen these really cool innovations and they want to start working in RWAs over the long run, you're going to see them work in curve LP positions. So again, I just think that there's more interesting models that we've seen and kind of Ave came out with this not bland model, but like one that already exists.
00:30:31.586 - 00:30:37.240, Speaker D: There isn't much innovation here, but at the end of the day, it is a more profitable model for Ave and it is the right thing to do.
00:30:38.330 - 00:30:59.760, Speaker B: We got a comment on a YouTube video last week. I think it was someone asking, why are Dan and Sam smiling ear to ear when Lucas says there needs to be a curve on Solana? It's exactly that. You can just hear the guy's passion. He's been talking about bringing curve over to Solana for like six months now. So if you ever hear that happening, that was definitely Dan's doing.
00:31:02.130 - 00:31:14.020, Speaker D: Oh, what an excellent comment. I didn't even see that one. That's incredible. Yeah, I have no idea if that's happening, but if you're a developer in the rust ecosystem, hit me up, because I want to make that happen.
00:31:14.630 - 00:31:50.794, Speaker E: Just briefly touching on lens, I'm not a consumer founder, but I feel like most social apps have taken off either a they found their own very specific niche that caters to a user base and then grown from there, or b they've introduced a new content type. Right? For example, short form videos with TikTok. Be real. And how you can take it with two different cameras. I don't know what the kids use these days, but it's always sort of enabled by a new content type that a lot of young Gen Z's find super cool and then just blows up from there. So, yeah, same thing as you guys. I'm not that bullish.
00:31:50.794 - 00:32:50.898, Speaker E: That's v two. And then similar from evaluation perspective between Ave curve and Maker. I feel like out of all of those, Ave doesn't deserve to be at the valuation at where it's at. And I lowkey agree with effort capital here in terms of maker potentially becoming, like, a top ten asset, maybe not by end of 2025, so soon, but maybe like five years down the road, just because overall, I feel like in the next five or ten years, RWAs are going to be a huge component of crypto and D five. I wouldn't be too surprised if ten years down the road, more than, like, 50% of TBO in crypto is for RWAS, or if I want to go, like super bootcase. If you take crypto's market cap, like, 50% of that will be like RWAs. So crypto's market cap is 1 trillion today, and 500 billion worth of RWAs will exist on chain in some form.
00:32:50.898 - 00:32:54.674, Speaker E: And I think maker is in a fantastic position to sort of capture that.
00:32:54.712 - 00:32:54.962, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:55.016 - 00:33:26.206, Speaker E: They have all of these teams working on due diligence. They have all of these existing frameworks built out. They have insane financial models built out by stake finance. Steakhouse? No steakhouse. And it seems that they've gotten that down. They work with Blocktower, various other hedge funds, sockgen for all of those real world asset generation or origination. And I can't think of any other protocol that's coming close to what makers are doing in terms of RWAS right now.
00:33:26.388 - 00:34:05.574, Speaker C: Yeah. At the end of the day, on a long term basis, we're setting up ourselves. I think one of the reasons why DeFi is catching a bid lately, and this is, I think, maybe a personal take, but in an increased interest rate environment that we're at right now, at least in the real world, with T bills yielding like, five and a half percent, the risk free rate is, like, high right now. There's a high hurdle rate, and borrowing capital in traditional financial institutions is extremely tight right now. You're seeing credit crunches happen. Obviously, the borrow rates are high right now. How DeFi wins is offering a lower borrowing cost than traditional financial institutions.
00:34:05.574 - 00:34:51.000, Speaker C: That is literally how it wins. And right now, this is, like, the exact opportunity for DeFi to outcompete tradfi. And once we get a really good regulatory framework in the United States, you're already seeing, like, Blocktower Capital and some crypto native institutions start tapping into cheap on chain liquidity to then Arb that price difference somehow by leveraging the on chain liquidity and bringing it to the real world. Maker is the on chain to off chain bridge today. And you're seeing Aave and other real world asset protocols starting to kind of, I guess, converge on this concept. But Maker's so far ahead that they are going to, in my opinion, they're likely going to win this race. I think one of the concerns is because they're trying to go through this whole endgame model.
00:34:51.000 - 00:36:08.926, Speaker C: Maker was such like a steady, and you know what you got from maker prior to this whole endgame proposal. Now they're trying to do a bunch of fancy shit that maybe can deter some more conservative traditional financial institutions, start tapping into maker liquidity. But if their end game thesis wins out and their whole revamp works out, I think you could see them just gain a lot of real world asset exposure and just like curve kind of has their own ecosystem with curve frax convex right now, I think the closest protocol tied to Makerdao is probably centrifuge, which does a lot of real world asset loan originations by tapping into maker liquidity in some form or fashion. Like Blocktower uses both maker and centrifuge to do some of their real world asset dealings. But you're going to start seeing a bunch of real world asset protocols try to tap into die liquidity through a d three M module and borrow die at a cheaper rate than traditional finance can offer. And I do think you're going to see trillions in Aum from DeFi, mostly on the back of makerdow like over the next decade. Probably Super bowl like thesis, but ultimately that's really what Defi's offering, is, is offering cheaper cost of capital than traditional finance.
00:36:09.038 - 00:36:45.802, Speaker D: Yeah, and I agree, the end game transition will be super interesting to watch. And you'd have to think if a protocol can effectively use its token, it has a leg up over protocols that do not use their token. I struggle to think that won't be the case. And so, going back to the three we just compared, Ave has a token model usage to advantage. Maker is working on implementing one and then Ave doesn't. I don't know, another thing to think about, but I think it's a good time to send it over to our interview with Layer Zero. But before we do that, I want to give a shout out to the atom accelerator.
00:36:45.802 - 00:37:28.118, Speaker D: They are doing a great job getting builders into the atom economic zone. And building out the cosmos ecosystem. They have these great tools that just come out of the box, and they have IBC interoperability that allows chains to communicate with each other without having to bring in this external system. They have interchange accounts that allow the chains to actually interact with other applications on different chains. They have duality coming to the ecosystem, kind of setting a new standard for value accrual as it pertains to the cosmos hub and interchange security. Stride's also a consumer here, and they're really pushing forward the advancement of liquid staking tokens. And then, of course, you have native USD coming through noble.
00:37:28.118 - 00:37:59.234, Speaker D: So we're about to soon have a very vibrant defi ecosystem. It's going to be a very fun time to build in the cosmos ecosystem. If you're looking to get something started, definitely be sure to click the link in the description that will take you to the atom accelerator homepage. They're giving grants on a rolling monthly basis that ranging from $10,000 to $1 million. So be sure to check them out again. If you're a builder, that's really who the ecosystem needs and is looking for and is looking to expand the power of the atom economic zone and the use of atom as money. So again, put the link in the description.
00:37:59.234 - 00:38:30.590, Speaker D: Be sure to check them out. Now onto the interview with Brian Pellegrino from layer zero. All right, everyone, today we are joined by Brian Pellegrino, the co founder and CEO of Layer Zero Labs. Brian, thanks a ton for joining us today. We have a pretty exciting conversation on the docket regarding all things Layer Zero and also Stargate, one of the exciting applications you guys have been working on. So I kind of want to start the conversation off going through layer zero and some of the cool things going on there. So one major security unlock of layer Zero is this oracle and relayer design.
00:38:30.590 - 00:38:38.786, Speaker D: And I kind of want to dive deep into this, but if we could just start with doing just a brief overview of kind of how this model works, I think that'd be a healthy starting point.
00:38:38.888 - 00:39:52.646, Speaker A: Most models prior, and that was sort of what led us to creating this, is that most models prior were basically you're going to delegate your security to some third party. So you would have whatever, insert any bridge provider here or like messaging protocol and you the application just say, I sort of trust them with everything transaction is going to happen here. They'll tell me if it's true or not and they'll kind of report out on the other side and that's fine for small applications. I think there are a lot of small applications who are willing to just completely delegate trust like that. But for larger applications it becomes very difficult. And one of the questions we had to continuously ask ourselves is like, okay, how does this scale beyond $100 million, a billion dollars? But how do you have a system that the largest d five protocols in the world dealing with tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, the stable coins of the world, the eventual, possibly tradfi system? How does all of this stuff resolve around one system? It was very clear that everybody's not just going to offload their security to some random third party, however secure that third party may be. And so the entire thesis of the layer zero structure was basically you needed to create a system that was flexible enough to service a bunch of groups.
00:39:52.646 - 00:40:35.698, Speaker A: So again, if you have this third party, the third party basically only gives you a single configuration, which means if you're a tiny NFT project who doesn't dealing with very low value things, you're an extremely, extremely ave dealing with 100 million dollar liquidations. The delta there is massive, and having them both subscribe to a single structure just doesn't make sense for either. So the whole principle of this was allowing this sort of like modular security. So we've seen Chainlink is in there. Zk lite client by polyhedra just got in there. We're starting to see more and more groups come in where there is a really robust set of options that any application basically gets to subscribe to. So there's a much more flexible security stack.
00:40:35.794 - 00:40:49.420, Speaker D: And so there's also this, obviously to kickstart this, you kind of had to push out these two default options for both the Oracle and the relayer. Is Stargate still using that? And what percentage of users of layer zero have kind of opted into building their own?
00:40:50.030 - 00:41:15.700, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So one thing that we've found is actually that running the Oracle component, which is just security, it's pretty easy, it's pretty straightforward. There's a lot of groups who could do that. Running the relayer is incredibly, incredibly difficult, whereas the relayer is basically just an oracle and execution tied together. Right. It really does security, but it also does execution. And execution is really difficult.
00:41:15.700 - 00:41:46.878, Speaker A: We have to deal with wallets on 35 main nets, 45 test nets. You're quoting constantly in all n squared directions in terms of how to price gas in both ways so that the user has a fully abstracted experience. You're keeping those wallets balanced. We're doing like 40 billion RPC calls per month right now. So it is like no joke in terms of scale of operation. And so that unsurprisingly people have been like, that's pretty hard to run. Whereas in the beginning we're like, yeah, listen, anybody can do that.
00:41:46.878 - 00:42:23.342, Speaker A: So we're going to be rolling out some changes in the coming months for how some of this stuff works and just make it so much easier for people to do so. It will look a lot different. Right now there are probably four groups. So we just released essence, which makes the oracle the security side, much easier. There are like four large applications and a bunch of your node infra providers, kind of like classic service providers who all are starting to build on this. So you'll see a landscape of probably a waitlist of about 50 people right now. Ten will probably roll out kind of early ish.
00:42:23.342 - 00:42:35.520, Speaker A: So it will start to expand pretty rapidly. And each of those have their own clusters of nodes and own structure. But yeah, so far on the relayer side it's been pretty slow, but that will change for sure.
00:42:36.530 - 00:43:05.506, Speaker D: Yeah, no kidding. It's a tall order to just be ripping 40 billion RPC calls in a short time frame like that. But I'm just curious that you mentioned the broad range of needs for the apps themselves, right? Ranging from Aave to a small NFT project, which end of the spectrum has been more in demand. Coming to layer zero being like, hey, we need to build a super large robust system or a bunch of people coming in like, hey, we just want to do these smaller type projects.
00:43:05.698 - 00:43:38.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a pretty broad mix in terms of actual contracts. Obviously layer zero is permissionless, right? So I probably have like 600 ongoing chats or something. But there's like 10,000 contracts deployed on main net now somewhere on the order of that. And so a huge number of teams have just come and deployed and never spoke to us. I would say actually the majority of teams never speak to us. They just go read the docs, deploy themselves. Of the traffic, we look at all of the traffic, but the traffic that's easy to identify.
00:43:38.690 - 00:44:26.366, Speaker A: It's probably like 70%, probably about 70% value transfer. So your typical, your bridges, your lending protocols, your whatever, pure, pure d five, mostly moving assets. This can be like the girly testnet bridge, the Aptos bridge, bringing assets into phantom, all that stuff. Stargate, of course, the second largest application in the network actually is DFI kingdom. So it's like gaming related basically with Item bridge. So that's the second overall, but still about 70% overall is value transfer. An inbound is like 50% gaming and NFTs in terms of actual inbound interest, but most of those haven't gone to market yet, and that hasn't translated into messaging volume.
00:44:26.366 - 00:44:28.500, Speaker A: So I think that will happen over time for sure.
00:44:29.510 - 00:44:54.586, Speaker B: Interesting. That's cool that gaming applications are super interested in layer zero technology. I did not know that. In terms of. Yeah, that's cool because that's kind of in the promise, right? Interoperability amongst games. So that does make sense. But shifting gears a little bit, I feel like every ecosystem kind of is looking to establish their own, I guess, bridging or cross messaging communication platform.
00:44:54.586 - 00:45:12.240, Speaker B: So you got like IBC for Cosmos, you got subnets in Avalanche, and then shared provers for zk rollups. What exactly is the primary difference between layer zero and an IBC? Let's say, considering it's often touted as the most secure bridging tech.
00:45:12.770 - 00:45:55.806, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, IBC is just like clients, right? IBC is very interesting. It's just basically you have a bunch of chains, and in order to move state data between them, you're going to basically run an on chain like client. So you're going to send every single block header from one chain to the other. And then when you have this sort of list of stacked block headers, then you can just take a proof, an arbitrary proof, and like, okay, walk it back to the root and prove that it's included in that set. So it's cool. We like the model in general. It's incredibly expensive, right? Like, if you want to send every single block header from a tenderman chain to Ethereum, you would not only fill up all of the blocks, but you'd spend like $100 million a day to do it.
00:45:55.806 - 00:46:13.170, Speaker A: There's just like no world that you're doing that. So that is the main. Right. There's a bunch of different ways you can do the ZK. Same stuff. Like, again, polyhedra is probably the leading they are by, in terms of messaging volume. Now, they're the number one most used zk messaging like client in the world.
00:46:13.170 - 00:46:40.662, Speaker A: And they're integrated rather than trying to build their own channels, integrated within layer zero so that applications can select them. Like layer Zero. People think, because the way you think about most bridges, the way you think about most of this stuff in the past is like the bridge is the security model, right? You choose X or Y or Z. Like, that is the security model you're choosing. That's not what layer Zero is. Layer Zero is like the protocol, right? It's a framework, and any existing system can just fit in the middle. IBC could run over layer zero incredibly easily.
00:46:40.662 - 00:47:08.206, Speaker A: This polyhedral ZK litecoin could have been some competitive bridge. It could have been anything like that. Instead, they chose to build inside of layer zero, and now they have like 30 x the volume in a month that the next sort of like ZK bridge has done a lifetime. Right? So the whole point is layer zero has distribution. We're not trying to solve the validation layer that's bigger. That's extremely progressive field. There's a bunch of interesting trade offs there.
00:47:08.206 - 00:47:46.126, Speaker A: All of that can live within the system. And so, yeah, I mean, the main trade off is that. Right? Like if you choose IBC, it's great, it's going to be fast and have its own security assumptions, sort of living within cosmos. The problem is when you try to go anywhere else, you now have to use an entirely different system. Like how do you go to ethereum, how do you go to X or Y or Z? Right? And there's all of these different trade offs. What layer zero gives you, which is really nice, which is like unified semantics, right? Like you can use IBC there and X here and y there, all within layer zero while having the exact same interface, the exact same semantics. All devs only need to have one structure for how to send data and receive data.
00:47:46.126 - 00:48:04.520, Speaker A: Everything else is just handled on the back end. So that is really, I would say the main difference is like, layer zero is not necessarily trying to solve what IBC does. IBC as the transport layer effectively, right? That sort of validation methodology can just live within layer zero.
00:48:06.090 - 00:48:47.022, Speaker D: So one of the things you mentioned there is you're not really trying to solve this validation. The idea of that. What does the future of layer zero really look like? I mean, hence the name, right? It kind of wants to live at that base layer, but you see other bridges or messaging solutions kind of moving towards this, like an L, two for synapse, or an independent proof of stake chain, like maybe axilar or wormhole. But then you also see like circle kind of launching there. Obviously not a layer zero solution, but it's like, again, something that's more abstracted away. How do you kind of see the dynamics playing between those two things? And do you eventually see like an LZ chain type thing or always being this sub layer?
00:48:47.166 - 00:48:55.400, Speaker A: No, definitely always being. I feel like people are just recycling the same mistakes that people have been making for like seven years now, right?
00:48:56.810 - 00:48:59.270, Speaker D: That doesn't sound like crypto at all. No way.
00:48:59.420 - 00:49:35.902, Speaker A: It's kind of insane to me. So the whole reason we built players here in this method is you're just not going to have one single chain that can secure $100 billion. It's really great way to sell a token and be like, listen, all the value will flow through this chain. So of course we're going to have $100 billion of security within this little external construct because we're securing everything. So this will be worth so much. But how many models of that have we seen? Probably 30 different models, and I don't think a single one of them has ever scaled past, like a billion dollars of crypto economic security. It's not even remotely close to the order of what needs to be secured.
00:49:35.902 - 00:50:12.320, Speaker A: And that's like, in the current set of where the space is, let alone like five years out. Effectively, this is roll your own bridge. We usually spent a ton of time with them as they were developing this. How many people need to roll their own bridge and get hacked before people stop trying to roll their own bridge? Right? Like, look at the Axironin hack, look at the harmony hack, look at all of the native bridges that have got hacked. And it's like, this might not be your core competency. That's okay, right? You're meant to build a chain or an application or whatever. You don't need to roll every part of the stack yourself.
00:50:12.320 - 00:50:32.214, Speaker A: And so again, I do think the more people that go that way, the worse it's going to end up. I think we will continue to see large hacks as we saw multiple in the last couple of weeks here already, again, and people just seem to keep going in circles here. But we'll see what happens.
00:50:32.332 - 00:51:00.830, Speaker D: No fair. Take completely there. And I want to get your take on just kind of like why this all matters. So, obviously, I would assume you're more built into the modular thesis than something like the high throughput Solana type thesis, where one single shard, that's all we're going to need. And you just mentioned that point around. Maybe it's not the best idea for you to build outside of your core competency and build every inch of the stack. So I'm curious, how do you see the future of the industry evolving when it comes to actual blockchain infrastructure and architecture?
00:51:01.330 - 00:51:41.054, Speaker A: Yeah, on the layer zero side, we've tried to be as agnostic as humanly possible. Ultimately, for us, it doesn't. Again, I equate the problem myself, how I think about layer zero is like, go back in time, pre Internet, and you have just random, isolated execution environments. You got DARPA, you got Stanford you got all these university groups, you have some data that you want to do some computation on. I'm going to fly to Stanford and run it on the computer. We invent this cool stack for moving state data around the Internet. We got TCP, IP, Ethernet, we run cable, we do all this other stuff and like, great, now we have, that's how we're talking now.
00:51:41.054 - 00:52:15.602, Speaker A: That's how we have all of these things. Like the base unit, that's a packet, it's just some compute here, some compute here with like an array of bytes. That's it. Create this array of bytes, send it over and do something with the array of bytes that is the Internet, effectively. And so now we're moving to this structure where great blockchains, cool, like isolated execution environments that have strong trade offs. So some of them are very good at throughput, some of them are very good at storage, some of them are very secure. No way to move state data between them, right? Layer zero is literally arbitrary contract invocation with a bytes array.
00:52:15.602 - 00:52:48.306, Speaker A: That's it. Do some compute here, take the bytes, move the bytes, do some, compute there, and that itself is massively valuable. 99% of all compute in the world still happens on a local computer. But the Internet is still the Internet. So for us, all we see is it's the same problem. We don't really care if it's 1000 orthogonal layer ones or ethereum, only as a settlement layer and 1000 layer twos, you're still going to need to move state data between those. We just try to build the primitive that makes it as easy as possible for both of those.
00:52:48.306 - 00:53:14.874, Speaker A: So we have no thesis as a company as to what is more likely. One thing that has been super surprising to me has been that I thought the most used pathways by far would be layer twos coming back to layer ones because like, all right, you're going from L one to l two. You're going to use maybe the native bridge. Barbara term optimism. It's free, it's built in like, okay, great, I use that. But I might not want to wait seven days to come back, so maybe I'll pay some premium to come back faster. Right.
00:53:14.874 - 00:53:45.860, Speaker A: There's something that I'm willing to basically assume for that I thought l two to l one would be by far the most used pathway. Not even close. Arbitrum and optimism are our most used nodes by far, but their most used counternodes or connections are to each other, actually. So it's like once people have made this decision to go from layer one, so go from layer one land to cheap, low fee, layer two land. They treat them largely as fungible. They want to jump around and do whatever they can between them. That's interesting.
00:53:45.860 - 00:54:25.780, Speaker A: They don't want to have to go back and pay an l one fee. So if you're on arbitrum and you want to go do an application on optimism or base or linear, like all the l two s that are coming up, there isn't a world you want to wait seven days to then go up and do that. And so that l two thesis, a lot of people early on were like, is the l two thesis going to be terrible for layer zero? It's been incredible boon for us to see the l two s taking off. So, no, I would say we don't have super strong opinions. I think even the most single, like, even the largest maxis of their own ecosystem, so, like, Anatoli Vitalik, et cetera, neither of them are like, everything is going to live here. Both of them are reasonably convinced that there'll be at least some.
00:54:28.230 - 00:54:37.090, Speaker D: Okay, that's super interesting to think that the connection between arbitram and optimism is so huge. And I'm assuming most of that activity is done through Stargate.
00:54:37.770 - 00:55:06.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, layer zero as a whole, probably like, 30%, 35% of overall volume is Stargate. So there's a bunch of different applications who go across that pathway for that specific pathway. I'm not sure what the breakdown is, but layer zero as a whole is 30, 35%, which has come down probably in November somewhere, September, November time frame, that number was, like, closer to, like, 80%. Right. So you've actually seen a bunch of other apps, like, meaningfully come online, which has been interesting.
00:55:06.930 - 00:55:14.430, Speaker D: Okay, that's a fantastic. Just proof of what else is coming online. Is that 35% still the largest single application?
00:55:14.580 - 00:55:16.674, Speaker A: Yeah, largest single application by far.
00:55:16.792 - 00:55:45.610, Speaker D: That's pretty good. Honestly. If you break down activity on even something like Ethereum, you probably get something, I would guess, if you measured by, let's say, transactions to a certain address, somewhere around 10% or 11% as the leading application. So that's actually quite impressive for just one year, a little over one year now. So pretty interesting there. And I think one of the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about Stargate is, okay, well, there's an obvious cyborg attempt going on here. Just simply pulling up the DFI llama dashboard.
00:55:45.610 - 00:56:08.770, Speaker D: I think last time I looked, it was like, 200,000 transactions in the last 24 hours for Stargate. ZK sync again. Another potential airdrop farming activity. That was number two at about 30,000. I think the other 16 or so bridges combined for maybe 10,000. So can you meaningfully measure the amount of cyber activity or how much organic use do you think is truly occurring right now?
00:56:08.920 - 00:56:32.140, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think it's hard. I actually got in trouble for trying to. A bunch of people started attacking me on Twitter for trying to back into this on Twitter. So I like to do random thought exercises of, like, okay, Stargate. Specifically, let's try to measure, like, stargate civil activity. What do you think the average size is of a civil transfer?
00:56:33.790 - 00:56:36.938, Speaker D: My guess would be somewhere between $10 and $100.
00:56:37.104 - 00:57:04.322, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So I did this exact math. So, stargate average transfer size right now is $455. Every other bridge, if you look at every normal bridge of the next X, they average out to about $845. Somewhere around there. So Stargate is roughly half, let's say a little bit more than half of that. So then you back into, like, okay, if you take, let's say, $100.
00:57:04.322 - 00:57:38.046, Speaker A: I think the math was, if it's $100, so if civil is 100 and organic is 855, or whatever the other bridges are, how much volume would be civil? And it was something like 54% or something would be civil. And so that's one metric everyone's like, that's insane. Clearly, it's infinitely higher than that. And I was like, okay, so what is the number? Is the civil average civil transfer, like, larger than organic transfer on other bridges? Just give me a number, and you can back in. It's just math. It's not, like, overly hard. So there's a bunch of ways to try to back into this.
00:57:38.046 - 00:58:11.862, Speaker A: I don't spend too much time thinking about it. Ultimately, it's something that's outside of my control. And so, effectively, I look at it right now, if 98% of all volume was stable, it would still be the most used bridge in the world by a factor of four. So who really cares? Build the thing with maximum utility and let everything else sort itself out. I don't spend a bunch of time trying to be like, it's exactly this, or here is how I classify volume versus others. It's just like, loose numbers. What is actually meaningful, you don't want to get lost in the noise.
00:58:11.862 - 00:58:26.400, Speaker A: And so I try to benchmark roughly where do we think the world is? Because what I care about is measuring layer zero adoption as a whole. But, yeah, I think there's a couple of different frameworks you could use for trying to back into what numbers make sense.
00:58:27.330 - 00:58:45.982, Speaker B: I like that mindset. I feel like there's no sense in trying to figure it out anyways. It's permissionless. Anyone's going to use it if they can. So might as well just forget about it and know that you're still putting in good work. But you mentioned CCTP. I am curious how you think that impacts Stargate's value proposition.
00:58:45.982 - 00:58:58.520, Speaker B: Obviously with circle backing bridge movement from chain A to chain B, there's no custody risk or anything like that. Like, you're going to be fine. So I guess I'm just curious, do you think that changes the value proposition at.
00:58:58.970 - 00:59:25.602, Speaker A: I mean, I think a world where something like TCTP takes off at scale, it definitely changes the demand. Right. Stargate ultimately solves an inventory problem, right. It's effectively, listen, I'm on chain A, whether I'm an application or a user. I've got $100,000 on chain A and I need it on chain B because I want to do something in a contract there. I want to be in that ecosystem, whatever start. It just abstracts away the inventory problem.
00:59:25.602 - 01:00:09.840, Speaker A: That's it. And so if you move to a world where these third parties are basically doing that themselves, then that would change, sort of. So you'll never ETH assets, ETH a couple of others, like native assets, you're never going to change. You're always going to need to basically have that. Nobody's going to have an arbitrary minter of ETH on other chains and everything. There's a couple of problems with CTTP right now, actually, for the pathways that it's enabled on, there's still more volume going over, even though you can, like once we turn it on, you'll be able to do CTP in Stargate over layer zero. Effectively the same in terms of message category, but it's like capped at a pretty low.
01:00:09.840 - 01:00:56.890, Speaker A: Like there's, there's throughput restrictions. Circle isn't providing it sort of all external parties would be. So like, Stargate would be sort of an interface for doing this. But yeah, the world definitely changes some, I would say. I'm not totally convinced that it will be super used at scale within a very fast timeframe. Like, it's only ETH to avalanche right now, and maybe they just turned on arbitram or about to turn on arbitrum, but those are like the only three pathways they have turned on, I think like very low volume usage overall at the moment. And then I do think there are know it's a new system, it's going to stand the test of time, security wise.
01:00:56.890 - 01:01:51.370, Speaker A: Ultimately, I think there is that concern, which is why the throughput limits are so low. Right. Ultimately, if you break that system, you can arbitrarily mint, like, if they uncapped it, right? If I broke it, I could arbitrarily mint $500 billion in Ethereum and drain every single decks, every single lending protocol. Like, every structure that exists, I could drain completely. And yes, the USDC will be recovered, but every other asset is gone. It's like pure existential risk for the entire industry. I think it's good they're putting throughput limits and hopefully taking that super responsibly, but there really is that risk that if that single attestation server is hacked, catastrophically bad for the entire ecosystem in a way that's unrecoverable again, you'll recover the USDC, you will never recover all of the east and every other asset that lives in those pools.
01:01:51.530 - 01:02:04.580, Speaker B: That's actually something I hadn't considered, so I think that's a very fair point. Probably a good idea to have those caps on, pivoting a little bit to Stargate V two. Are you able to share any details around what's in store there?
01:02:05.930 - 01:02:45.966, Speaker A: Yeah, let me see what I can actually share. Stargate V two is a very significant upgrade. If done with Hydra, it will reduce emissions to basically zero, and gas costs will be cut by probably 80 ish percent at least, but possibly closer to, like, 99%. So without saying more than that, it will be by far, like, it's already the most liquid pathways, it's already the cheapest pricing, it's more expensive on gas reasonably frequently. That will change. In my opinion. There will be no reason to use another bridge.
01:02:45.966 - 01:03:16.586, Speaker A: And then the economics of Stargate will change such that right now, last month, I think it did, like, $2 million in overall revenue generated and spent about a million to a million one in emissions. That already should be cut down to, like, 700, 800K now in emissions for this coming month. So you're talking like $1.2 million net profit for the protocol. Emissions will go to near zero, effectively. So, yeah, it'll be interesting. I don't know.
01:03:16.586 - 01:03:33.386, Speaker A: Again, we try not to be too noisy about most of the dev stuff. I joke when we launch. We came out of stealth in overnight. Nobody had ever heard of us. We released our white paper, instantly jumped from stone zero to, like, 40,000 followers on Twitter. Like, 15,000. Telegram and discord.
01:03:33.386 - 01:03:48.280, Speaker A: We didn't put out a single other tweet for like, six months until we launched the protocol. Right. We're very prone to just kind of like, going in, just like building stuff. So we're trying to be a little bit better about talking in general, but, yeah, when it comes out, it's going to be awesome.
01:03:51.770 - 01:04:03.626, Speaker D: Today, emissions are going to incentivizing liquidity throughout the platform and the different channels. And are you able to expand on what about V two is able to kind of rein that into near zero?
01:04:03.808 - 01:04:18.046, Speaker A: Yeah. So Hydra V two will be like, gas reduction. V two is like a change in Stargate itself, makes more efficient all that stuff. Hydra was. This proposal that I put out. It hasn't passed nobody. Like, people have been talking about it, but nobody's done anything about it.
01:04:18.046 - 01:04:42.710, Speaker A: But Hydra was effectively like, our thesis when we built Stargate was all wrapped assets suck. There's like this additional sort of risk that goes on to the end user that they're not used to in a usual protocol. Infinite hacks happen from. There's like a bad. It's strictly worse than native assets. And so our thesis was like, everybody will want to use native assets, and native assets will be kind of everywhere. They will be the dominant asset.
01:04:42.710 - 01:05:13.390, Speaker A: Since we launched like 15 months ago, I think, like, one new chain got native assets, right. They just haven't moved at all. And yet wrapped assets have gotten hacked like, 15 different times. And so the thesis was like, listen, we thought wrapped assets were going away. Native assets were going to be everywhere. That has proven not to be the case in that world. Why are we making everybody else use these kind of sketchy bridges? Like, Stargate probably has by far the most consumer trust around a bridge.
01:05:13.390 - 01:05:37.110, Speaker A: It's the most used. All that did $3 billion in transfer volume last month and the month before. So if anybody is going to do wrapped assets, why doesn't stargate just do it? Never had any security risk everything. So in a world, you'll have Stargate, the native protocol that lives here and does everything how you would do now and then. Let's say you're going to go to, I don't know, name a chain that doesn't have native assets.
01:05:39.290 - 01:05:43.190, Speaker D: I guess Phantom now does. That was the first one that came to my mind. What about Moonbeam?
01:05:43.270 - 01:06:06.190, Speaker A: Phantom could be moonbeam. Yeah, moonbeam. Sure. So, like, let's say moonbeam. Now, basically, Stargate would, through Hydra, have wrapped assets go to moonbeam. So you would lock them up on Ethereum or wherever, move it over to Moonbeam. You have, let's say, Stargate USDC, that lives on Moonbeam right now, most wrapped asset bridges charge you about ten bits to go round trip.
01:06:06.190 - 01:06:41.594, Speaker A: That would be entirely free in both directions. But the price for it effectively would be we're going to take the underlying, or Stargate is going to take the underlying asset that lives in the contract on Ethereum. And rather than have it just sit there, it's going to supply it to the Stargate pools. So now if you move 50 million over to Phantom, you'll have that 50 million, instead of sitting in an idle contract, will sit within the Stargate native pools, which means that's 50 million less dollars that stargate. The protocol needs to incentivize, and it will always be there. If people come back from Moonbeam and want to take it out, you just remove it from Stargate exactly as it works. System stays solvent, all that stuff.
01:06:41.594 - 01:06:55.810, Speaker A: But there's basically no need for emissions after that. And all of the ecosystems you're going to, both the users get free bridging and the ecosystems get an ideally wrapped asset that is much more reliable than historically prevalent.
01:06:56.550 - 01:07:10.070, Speaker D: How does the separation go to, like, if I'm a user or maybe even if I'm an LP in traditional Stargate today, the V one model, how is my risk still being sharded away from getting involved with these wrapped assets?
01:07:10.810 - 01:07:48.382, Speaker A: Yeah, the wrapped asset contract only has so much LP, right? So it's just, again, let's take the moonbeam example. $50 million goes from locked on. Ethereum of USDC goes over. And now you have $50 million of Stargate USDC on moonbeam. 50 million of USDC that's sitting in that contract adds to Stargate and holds Stargate LP, right? So like S Star USDC, representing $50 million of the LP pool, that's the maximum amount that stargate. The protocol sort of has any sort of risk or anything, right? You can never redeem more than that. Stargate, the protocol isn't minting arbitrary.
01:07:48.382 - 01:08:01.110, Speaker A: This system actually lives entirely outside of Stargate, the core protocol. It's just an external wrapping contract that effectively participates in there, which is like, net good for Stargate and then drives zero fees to the ecosystems.
01:08:02.330 - 01:08:31.418, Speaker D: Okay, that makes a ton of sense, because I know one of the core missions of this V two model was really just to increase surface area of where Stargate and even layer zero could kind of expand and reach into these corners. Maybe Stargate wasn't, but layer zero could already be there. And this kind of opens the door to more fee accrual. Right? Because that's kind of the idea here, is being a protocol and generating revenue. So I'm curious to get your ideas around. How do you think about protocol value accrual? Where should that end up going, and how should that be used within the ecosystem?
01:08:31.514 - 01:09:01.746, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, number one, Stargate's mission from the beginning, as I see it, and the community seems to have catalyzed around it, is ultimately, like, grow protocol and liquidity, period. So Stargate has 90 ish million dollars of pol. Right now, it's growing by one to $2 million of pol a month. Once you hit about $250,000,000, Stargate needs no emissions. So that's, like, another path to zero emissions. Like take away hydro, take away anything. $250,000,000, you can surface every single thing that is in production.
01:09:01.746 - 01:09:36.226, Speaker A: Now, do the same. $3 billion a month you're doing in volume, and have zero emissions. Stargate owns all of it. Stargate captures 100% of the fees of the swap, fee of sort of like everything around that. So that is like a path. So I think the number one thing is get to the critical mass of, like, the goal of Stargate should be drive emissions to zero, right? If emissions, like, if every dollar you give out emissions yields you less than a dollar back to the protocol, then your goal should be to remove those as quickly as humanly possible, and then you retain every single dollar of value that the protocol has. And the protocol owns that.
01:09:36.226 - 01:09:56.540, Speaker A: Right. It's not like any external party is owning it within the protocol, and it should be put to use in the most productive manner. So if that is living in Stargate, that's what it should do. If it's something else, that's what it should do. Stargate as a whole goal should be to capture as much surface of fees as humanly possible in the most efficient manner as humanly possible. That's how I see it.
01:09:58.830 - 01:10:17.460, Speaker D: Right on. Yeah. I think that idea makes a ton of sense. That makes a lot of sense to me as Stargate, the protocol. But then when I think about moving back to layer zero, is there fee capture for layer zero, is that the intent, or is that just not even the direction that you kind of want to be pushing in?
01:10:17.990 - 01:10:52.240, Speaker A: No. Yeah. So right now, there's, like, these participants within the ecosystem. So, again, your chain links, your polyhedrals, relayers, all these things, right? They charge whatever fees they want to charge. It's an open marketplace. Ultimately, you can imagine, that will get largely commoditized down, right? People will sort of this line of cost versus security, and people will kind of take the cheapest cost option, where it gives them their minimum bar of relative security. And so all of those participants sort of have their own fee structures and whatever they charge layer zero, the protocol right now doesn't charge anything.
01:10:52.240 - 01:11:22.840, Speaker A: But effectively, that marketplace of participant in the middle is like a large part of layer zero. So you can imagine whatever that looks like in the future. I won't dive into it too much, but Stargate is like, net good for layer zero. All of these applications are like, net good for layer zero, because ultimately, there's, like, surface of traffic, of volume of fees for these participants, which means more secure systems are going to come online. There's more incentive to be within the layer zero ecosystem, all of these things.
01:11:24.730 - 01:11:48.080, Speaker B: Interesting. Okay, now, you mentioned that you want to get emissions for Stargate down to as little as possible, honestly, zero, ideally, and increase protocol and liquidity. So a lot of people in my corner say bridges are erased to zero on fees. Would you argue the opposite? And is that kind of the strategy around protocol and liquidity? If that's where all the liquidity is, then maybe you actually have some pricing power.
01:11:48.610 - 01:12:42.910, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. I mean, ultimately, bridges, depending on how they're native bridges, like Stargate, is just a capital efficiency game, right? How much liquidity can you have? You want to do a $10 million transfer on any pathway, unless you're going to wait like, 24 hours or for a centralized entity or something, you're just not going to do it on any other system but Stargate right now. So ultimately, there's a bunch of directional flow that you cannot do elsewhere, and you just need liquidity. When you go to all of these, as a number of chains expand, it might be easy for somebody else to reproduce on a two chain pathway, right? So you'll see people go like, ETH arbitram optimism, and it's like, okay, they can go ETH to arbitram optimism for free. They just wrap the native bridge, and that's fine, easy. Of course, we have unlimited liquidity, like go that pathway. But then when you try to go arbitram to optimism, it's like, oh, actually, we have very little liquidity here.
01:12:42.910 - 01:13:11.522, Speaker A: You can only do X. So people involve part of the puzzle. It's very hard to be able to put it together at scale. And I think liquidity is the premium. Ultimately, LPs need a certain, like, in order for them to have their capital sitting there for an extended period of time for use, for on demand use. There's some hurdle rates, right? Right now, if you look at Stargate, if you look at most on chain stuff, that hurdle rate is like somewhere between four and 6%. Call it 5%.
01:13:11.522 - 01:13:40.962, Speaker A: Right? So that's what LPs need to be able to stay stagnant. End users are willing to pay some premium to basically have this service now have the liquidity available when they need it. Applications who don't want. Imagine building an application, sushi swap, metamask, whatever, and randomly when you want to do a transfer over a pathway, it's like, yeah, we'll get back to you in 24 hours. Don't worry, this will happen at some point. Good luck. Right? And you as application never know when your user is going to experience that.
01:13:40.962 - 01:14:14.506, Speaker A: You know what I mean? There's a bunch of friction points. So applications and users will pay some premium for convenience and real world examples of that. I think Uniswap's UI itself still retains something like 30% to 40% of overall transaction volume. Right. It's basically always going to be cheaper to go use one inch or go use any aggregator to do these things, right? Always. But people use it because they trust it. There's just like a convenience factor to always go back to the same URL that you have bookmarked and you're not worried about getting rugged, you're not approving new contracts.
01:14:14.506 - 01:14:29.742, Speaker A: There's all this different stuff. So there is some premium and some utility that's added to applications and consumers to have that. But when you already have that, it's very difficult to bootstrap. And so you can compete on fees in a way that other people just can't.
01:14:29.806 - 01:14:39.320, Speaker D: One thing we haven't talked about yet is omnichain fungible tokens ofts. Can you walk us through what these are and kind of how they work to improve crypto's ux, basically.
01:14:40.090 - 01:15:27.246, Speaker A: Again, we're seeing the negative repercussions of this two years after we were writing about it, right? So really the inception of T's were this construct of like take multi chain, right? So we just had the multi chain hack and all this bad stuff happening around Multichain. There was billions of dollars of assets that were moved over multichain and we were just hearing these constant horror stories of teams who negotiated with that team to bridge their token across. So you would move your token over multi chain and you would get like any X, right? So any X is like your new token on the other side for any. They were called any swap at the time. And then randomly Mulgin would be like, now there are fees. Like you had negotiated zero fees, now there's fees. And nobody can unwind without paying them fees.
01:15:27.246 - 01:16:19.026, Speaker A: So there's some arbitrary gatekeeper where you're paying 6810 twelve bips to this external party, you have no control over the security. So there's a bunch of times where there wasn't enough money in the contracts that were supposed to be because on the back end they had the ability to move this liquidity around whenever they wanted. For native redemptions. If they got hacked, you were just 100% wrecked. There are all these things of just like friction points. Why are teams moving their entire single most valuable asset over to some third party provider, and then at the same time what you're getting on the other side was just this vanilla wrapped ERC 20 token. So if you were like Olympus Dow and you had rebasing, or you had anything in there that was stripped out on the destination chains, who couldn't do the functionality that you needed, you couldn't have.
01:16:19.026 - 01:17:01.442, Speaker A: So it was a mess in terms of how the structure was. So the principle of the oft was like listen, layer zero again is arbitrary contract invocation with a bytes array. Stargate is just pools of liquidity that sits there, and layer zero relays messages that Stargate constructs back and forth. So it's like somebody adds here, Stargate generates a message that says like a million dollars was added here, go to that chain and tell it. Layer zero moves that message, Stargate on the other side interprets it and releases a million dollars. So add release, and layer zero just moves the data. So when you think about that same construct, OFP is just a contract that the end creator owns, they own the contract, they own the functionality, they own what's allowed to go across.
01:17:01.442 - 01:17:42.414, Speaker A: You want to add rate limits, no problem. You want to add precrime, no problem, it doesn't matter. You can do anything that you can do on chain within that contract, and layer zero moves the messages. So when you talk about moving your asset around, instead of using any swap or whatever third party provider like burn the asset here, mint the asset there, you've constructed the message, you have this secure messaging pathway between there, do something in this contract, do something in that contract, you can guarantee solvency of the entire system, there's zero fees. And so now when you think about what does that buy you? And so like stablecoins, like Circle, CCTP is effectively this just in a totally centralized manner. Ultimately it's their attestation server that sits there. They said anybody can come and request this API attestation and move the data around.
01:17:42.414 - 01:18:10.554, Speaker A: So they kind of took an abstracted sense we're like, anybody can. So any messaging layer can do it. We just want to sign the message. But effectively, when you think about an oft, one of the biggest benefits is like, yeah, rebalancing again, inventory is like a massive problem, right? Maybe avalanche only had like $500 million of USDC minted over the avalanche bridge at some point. And now there's some new farm that launches on avalanche. Like, D five. Summer is happening.
01:18:10.554 - 01:19:11.494, Speaker A: Avalanche is super in demand. In order for people to jump from Salana or Phantom or whatever other chain to avalanche to move that USDC over, even though it exists in circulation, ended up being like, you might wait 45 minutes and you might pay like ten to 15 bips to get over there into that route, which is insane. And so now with oft, you have the ability to move near unlimited amounts of money within the contract for literally just the cost of gas. Like, you want to move $100 from Salana to avalanche, it's going to cost you eleven cents to move, like $100 million, right? The contract can just make the fee zero strictly the price of gas. And when you can do that, think about what that does for capital efficiency. Now, if moving my BTCB, my bitcoin synthetic, my stable coins, et cetera, is effectively free, now I can arb spreads to subsets, all right? Now you can arb pairs across all these chains to subsence spreads. So all Dex pairs become incredibly capital efficient.
01:19:11.494 - 01:19:49.922, Speaker A: All this stuff becomes incredibly capital efficient because the friction that people have been paying to tax the consumer to move the asset is driven to near zero. And then the other thing are teams. Like, if you were already paying 6810, twelve bips to an external service provider, and you're like a decentralized stablecoin, you can now own it in the contract and you can charge, cut it in half, charge three bips, and you yourself get it. And it's a way to monetize where now you own a large percentage of every fee that's out. It's not only half price for the consumer, but you're not paying it to any external provider. You can own it yourself. There's a surface of, like, if you want to have fees, at least it goes to you, the project, not some random third party.
01:19:49.922 - 01:20:10.542, Speaker A: And so, yeah, that is the construct of OFD. It's just a contract structure that lives on top of layer zero. But it is meant to turn the control of these assets back over to the end creator rather than delegating them out to third parties, which again, has ended largely terribly in most cases, so.
01:20:10.596 - 01:20:41.942, Speaker D: One of the users of this has been Abercadabra with this decentralized stablecoin, Mim. And I think they just launched the oft in early June. So a little over a month ago now, already seen over 87 million MIM transferred across a series of different chains, mostly to and from arbitrum, which is pretty interesting, right. Because if you're Abercadabra, you want your decentralized stablecoin everywhere. Arbitram has kind of been becoming increasingly known as this DFI hub as far as Ethereum l two s go. And now they kind of have this ability to just get to and from that chain. So that's pretty interesting.
01:20:41.942 - 01:20:56.746, Speaker D: But I find it more interesting about the fees that you mentioned. Right. I feel like I need to go check this contract and see if Abracadabra is kind of capitalizing on this. So I'm curious if you know that one specifically, but I think they're charging zero fee.
01:20:56.778 - 01:21:11.538, Speaker A: I'm not 100% sure, but I think they went with zero because I think their structure, they make money when Mim is minted, effectively. So they already have this monetization structure, but it's definitely a revenue source for sure if they want it to be.
01:21:11.704 - 01:21:20.070, Speaker D: So what does the security model look like specifically in this context? Right, so did they operate a relayer in this context?
01:21:20.970 - 01:21:50.174, Speaker A: So they could. Right, so in this case, it's just like anything else on layer zero, effectively, you choose your validators effectively. So let's say you're going to do chain link the ZK lite client, and like the layer zero relay, let's say you're going to stack the three of those effectively, and that's going to be your security structure. Fine, no problem. You can stack all three. In Circle's case, if they wanted TTP to basically effectively act as an oracle within layer zero, they could do exactly what they're doing within layer zero already. Right.
01:21:50.174 - 01:22:20.614, Speaker A: And so now instead you just have the relayer, like, grabbing that testation, but they could do that themselves inside. So it really is always like, with everything with layer zero, it's always application owned. At the end of the day, completely modular. They can do whatever they want. A lot of applications don't want to have to run their own, but they're totally fine being like, listen, polyhedral ZK lite client and chain link combined, that's enough security for me. I'm fine with that. But for applications where it's not, when you are dealing with tens of billions, whatever it is, then you have the ability to run one.
01:22:20.614 - 01:22:55.640, Speaker A: And the nice part is, again, you're effectively operating one with veto rights. So rather than delegating 100% of your security away, you're now saying, I'm still going to keep this external security and I will make sure that I sign every message that I'm included in everyone such that I have veto rights. If you guys lie and are malicious, I get to veto it. But if I get hacked, you guys are a fallback to me as well. So now the assumption to be able to hack the team, take their private keys and simultaneously break the ZK lite client and hack chain link all collectively, the hurdle becomes very high.
01:22:56.330 - 01:22:59.030, Speaker D: So what's the risk here? Why isn't everyone launching.
01:23:00.730 - 01:23:24.240, Speaker A: Mean ultimately? Ultimately, I think it's just think, you know, pancake swap. Multi billion dollar token move to oft trader Joe Joe Token is an oft. Avalanche's BTCB is an oFt. Abracadabra's mim is an oft. Right. So I actually think we're very happy with oft adoption so far. I think we're going to see a bunch of other very large projects coming out soon.
01:23:24.240 - 01:23:55.986, Speaker A: Like some of the largest in the world. And so I think we will continue to see this. It just takes time. Everything takes time. Again, I look at contract adoption on layer zero and it's just like as steady state growth up as you could ever hope for it just as really continual churn. And it's like, I know, I don't know, hundreds of projects that are building right now that just haven't gone to market. When we were at 5500 contracts on main net, there were 35,000 contracts on Testnet.
01:23:55.986 - 01:24:07.420, Speaker A: So that's like the type of overhang that is then going to be coming to Mainnet. So it just takes time. We're in no rush. We're going to keep building the best stuff we can build and it'll come.
01:24:08.990 - 01:24:20.560, Speaker B: You mentioned BTC B. Are you able to kind of elaborate how that works? Because I just feel like the bitcoin bridging design space has always kind of left a lot to be desired for.
01:24:21.010 - 01:24:43.682, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So avalanche made this structure where they had their own bridge, their own permissionless bridge, to say, you can take bitcoin from the bitcoin network to avalanche and back, right? You can do this permissionlessly. And so you would do it. You would mint this BTCB asset in avalanche. But it just lived in avalanche. And so what they did is they went and made BTCB an oFt.
01:24:43.682 - 01:25:01.230, Speaker A: And so now, great, you have taken from bitcoin to avalanche. Now you can take it from avalanche to anywhere to all 35 chains. Right. So now you can have BTCB on Aptos, on Phantom on any of these other chains as a bitcoin derivative. And anybody who wants to go back effectively just goes back to avalanche and out to the bitcoin network.
01:25:02.530 - 01:25:07.950, Speaker B: Okay, I see. So you're still trusting, though. Avalanche as the kind of like, bridge custodian.
01:25:08.450 - 01:25:33.426, Speaker A: So as the layer of moving from bitcoin to avalanche and back know their own structure. So their core bridge, that's a product that had already been developed. And then they took the end result of that and made it an oft to move it everywhere. So, yes, you have this two parts component where to and from bitcoin still is that system that they've built. And then from avalanche everywhere is the OFP.
01:25:33.618 - 01:25:51.690, Speaker B: Okay, interesting. Sounds somewhat similar to WBTC in a. Yeah, cool. Well, this has been an awesome conversation. I learned a ton. I feel like I was just kind of a fly on the wall, but I'm glad I got to see it firsthand. Dan, did you have any more questions before I pass it over to Brian to share more about where people can find them?
01:25:51.840 - 01:26:02.240, Speaker D: Yeah, Brian, I got one more for you. I want to hear something. What is something that you've been thinking about as a really interesting idea that would be perfect to be built on layer zero, but just hasn't happened yet.
01:26:03.170 - 01:26:53.322, Speaker A: All right, so I have, like, a real answer or two that I'm not going to give you because you'll just see them in production when they're ready. There are some really cool things coming. Really, in my opinion, as transformative for this side of the space as anything, even including our launch, as anything we've ever done. So I'm very excited about what we've been working on. The easy answer that I've given a bunch historically is, like, the one thing I thought for sure would happen that hasn't yet is lending and borrowing in a manner that you can collateralize anywhere and borrow anywhere. Because I saw that as disrupting kind of like tens of billions of dollars of wrapped assets. Like, I think 95% of use cases just want to collateralize native or stable and borrow native and stable.
01:26:53.322 - 01:27:21.046, Speaker A: That is the supermajority. I'm on ethereum. I want to go to Salana. I might want to collateralize my ETH and borrow sol because I don't want to take the tax hit. I don't want to lose ETH exposure. But I want to do something in the sol ecosystem or I want to collateralize sol and borrow stable in another ecosystem. Just native and stable covers almost everything, 95% of all wrapped assets in existence.
01:27:21.046 - 01:27:59.602, Speaker A: And so I thought those structures would come to market faster. Now, radiance started sort of the earliest parts of this of, like, you can move and you can deposit anywhere and you have lend and borrower where you can bring things anywhere. There's Segio and a couple of others are coming out where they're again working closer and closer to this structure. But that and stablecoin of Ts were like, the two things that was like, this just has to happen. The world is too inefficient as is. Somebody will definitely be doing this, and it's been slower than originally expected. But like you said, mim has just come and yeah, we see a bunch of lending protocols working on it as well.
01:27:59.656 - 01:28:10.742, Speaker D: Awesome. Well, I'm excited to find out more about the real answer at some point soon then, but thanks again, Brian. Can you just leave some with the audience to let them know where you can hear more from you and learn more about Layer Zero and Stargate as well?
01:28:10.796 - 01:28:27.566, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, obviously anybody who knows me knows very, very active on Twitter. Probably too active, but you can find me at Primordiala on Twitter there. Layer Zero is layer zero, underscore labs and Stargate finance. But, yeah, hit me up. I'll be around.
01:28:27.668 - 01:28:32.220, Speaker D: Too active. Aren't we all? So it's the devil's juice for us. But thanks again, Brian. Cheers, man.
