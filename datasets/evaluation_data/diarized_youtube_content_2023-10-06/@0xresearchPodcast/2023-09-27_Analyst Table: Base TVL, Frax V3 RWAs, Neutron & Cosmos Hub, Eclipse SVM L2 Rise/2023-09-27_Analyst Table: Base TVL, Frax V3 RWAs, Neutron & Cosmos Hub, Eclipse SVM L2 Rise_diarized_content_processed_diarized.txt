00:00:00.090 - 00:00:18.240, Speaker A: The Cosmos hub invested about like $500,000 approximately in Neutron, and today, those tokens, it's about 4.3% of the total neutron supply and it's about 28% of the current circulating supply neutron. That amount that will be transferred, or potentially transferred to the Cosmos Hub treasury equates to about $18 million.
00:00:21.090 - 00:00:54.762, Speaker B: Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Before we hop into today's episode, want to give a quick word from our sponsor, Hexens, the most hardcore security team in web3. Pioneering in ZK and novel cryptography, Hexens is trusted by tier one projects like Polygon, including their work on their new ZKVM, Mantle Risk, Zero, Lido, one inch Newbank and more. You'll hear a little bit more about them later in the show. Also, I want to give a shout out to Blockworks research.

00:00:54.762 - 00:01:24.310, Speaker B: We just launched a really cool data product and we'd love to hear what you guys think about it. Today is September 25, and as a reminder, we are changing up the format of this show and splitting into an analyst segment as well as an interview segment. The interview with Nick Johnson from ENS will come out Thursday and this episode should be airing on Wednesday, September 20 eigth. But as always, we're joined by two blockworks research analysts, effort Capital and zero X pibbles, to jam on the latest market happenings. Pibbles, why don't I kick it over to you for your hot seat or cool throne?
00:01:24.650 - 00:02:02.370, Speaker C: Yeah, so I've got a cool throne and it also doubles as a hot seat for Salana. But Base flipped Salana and TVL. Officially it's sitting at 370 mil, so this is a pretty big step. And they've really overtaken every new roll up that launched this year. Like, base is just kind of one and that's partially because of bald and then gold and all these stupid scammy tokens. But now we're seeing aerodrome and friend tech kind of leading the charge for base. Together they're making up, like, I think, 100 mil of a TVL.
00:02:02.370 - 00:02:37.040, Speaker C: We also have 30 different dexes, so one for every user. And notably uniswap is like one of the worst utilized Dexes on base. Another thing to flag is that they flipped 4.8 million in profit from the sequencer in Q three alone, so things are going up into the right. Also, Coinbase's chief legal officer came out and said that a token is not completely out of the question, and it could make sense in the future. So lots of fun things going on over there.
00:02:38.290 - 00:02:47.106, Speaker D: I didn't see that, actually, about the token thing. I'm guessing that's to play a role in decentralizing some piece of the stack. But did he specify at all?
00:02:47.288 - 00:02:56.870, Speaker C: No, it was literally like two sentences. But we all ruled that out to begin with, so now that puts some hope on the table.
00:02:57.930 - 00:03:05.430, Speaker A: Tokenized coin. Stake it to the sequencer. Coin shareholders now get the double dip in the base revenue. That's the dream.
00:03:06.650 - 00:03:29.898, Speaker D: That, honestly be really cool if they actually pulled that off. And there's no reason that they can't be the one. Okay. Assuming the regulatory conditions allow for that. Coinbase is already doing a tokenized version of ETH, right? They would give you Cbe and custody the ETH themselves, and stake it and operate that. Be really cool. If they did that with an equity, that'd be very fascinating.
00:03:29.898 - 00:03:42.850, Speaker D: And they are well positioned to be the first person to do it. Granted, they're probably going to be one of the very few, currently the only, and likely continuing to be the very few publicly traded, centralized exchanges.
00:03:44.070 - 00:04:19.866, Speaker B: Yeah, I think though, that that quote was taken a little bit out of context. I think you went on a podcast and like Pibble said, dropped like one sentence about it, and then it became this big news story. So I feel like we're definitely a little ways away from that actually becoming reality, despite us probably rooting for it hard. And I also think it's kind of funny that aerodrome is making up 90 to 100 million of TbL on base, but it's only seeing like 500 to daily volume on the actual decks. Like, all the volume is still over on uniswap and think pancake swap. So I don't really know who's lping there. I guess everyone just farming arrow and dumping it by looking at the token chart.
00:04:19.866 - 00:04:22.606, Speaker B: But yeah, nonetheless, that was a pretty brutal play.
00:04:22.708 - 00:04:22.986, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:23.028 - 00:04:44.438, Speaker C: I also want to flag that. There's one interesting app. I can't remember what it's called right now, but it's like a social network for content creators who own pets. I've seen Jesse Pollock tweeting about it, but it's off to a hot start on base, so I need to go look that up later.
00:04:44.604 - 00:04:52.540, Speaker D: Is this friend tech but for pets? Like posting pictures of your pet? Because that seems like a real product market fit.
00:04:55.230 - 00:04:59.130, Speaker B: I think parallel is over there too, right? If I'm not mistaken.
00:05:00.930 - 00:05:09.998, Speaker C: I'm actually not sure. I do want to say that they deployed something over there, but off the noggin, I do not know.
00:05:10.164 - 00:05:19.442, Speaker B: I saw Jiho is the axie, one of the prominent figures over there. He was talking about how he wants parallel to launch on Ronin. So that's another interesting tidbit I picked up on today.
00:05:19.496 - 00:05:56.350, Speaker D: I want to give a quick shout out to Hexins as we explore today's blockchain landscape, let's take a moment to recognize them as a premier cybersecurity provider in web3. Hexins is trusted by tier one projects like Polygon, including a security review on their new Polygon, ZKE, EVM, Mantle, Risk, zero, Lido, one Inch, Newbank, and more. Get a deep dive into your technology stack with the most comprehensive analysis and cybersecurity consulting, Hexons not only uses widely known methodologies and flows, but discovers and introduces new ones on a day to day basis. With over $55 billion secured, they cover everything from smart contracts to blockchain to web two pen tests.
00:05:57.010 - 00:06:03.134, Speaker B: Yeah, there's been nearly $7 billion of total value hacked in Crypto's nascent history, so it's safe to say your team.
00:06:03.172 - 00:06:04.206, Speaker A: Has a lot on the line.
00:06:04.308 - 00:06:23.522, Speaker B: Don't skimp out. Take your security seriously and reach out to Hexans. Don't forget to mention zero x research for a free web two pen test with your partnership, and reach out to Hexans at Hexins IO. Find them in the links in the show notes, or reach out to them at permissionless. They'll be at booth 832. But without further ado, let's get back to today's episode.
00:06:23.586 - 00:07:10.550, Speaker C: One more cool thorn I have is frax with V three, which just completed audit by trail of bits on September 20. This is laying the groundwork for fracs to really push their RWA strategy. You can actually see their finres PVC, which is a registered legal entity. They actually have an address on chain, and you can see them testing transfers with circle. Sam K said that the first official attestation should be reported on October 1, and they've already put some of the collateral backing fracs into some treasuries. So super neat stuff on the way. On top of that, we have staked fracs coming in, too.
00:07:10.550 - 00:07:20.830, Speaker C: So maybe October is a good month for FXS, and it follows the trajectory of Maker, but we'll just have to see about that. We're still waiting on fracs.
00:07:20.850 - 00:07:28.058, Speaker D: Gov, too, is staked fracs, basically the same thing as, like, SDI, where you're opting in to earn some of that.
00:07:28.064 - 00:07:41.390, Speaker C: Treasury yield, as far as I'm concerned, yes. But technically there's a bunch of different stuff, but the same goal actually, or just like passing on yield and increasing demand for fracs.
00:07:42.210 - 00:08:30.426, Speaker D: Nice. Yeah, I'm really excited to see this come to fruition. Right. Because Makerdao struggled internally with how do we make sure we're getting these off chain reporting actually completed, and how do we create a process around that? How do we manage this as a DAO? And that's a huge challenge to. So where Makerdao uses multiple service providers with different types of financial instruments, which means different types of reporting across many entities, Frax is saying, let's just shove that into one entity and let them manage all that for us. And then all we have to do is have this one point of contact for all of our off chain assets, and that should greatly simplify the management of reporting for a DAO. And that's a really cool way to do this when that's been a huge pain point for the RWA leader in Makerdao.
00:08:30.426 - 00:09:17.210, Speaker D: So I'm really excited to kind of see this play out, because there really is no reason that they can't be in the same level of success as Makerdao as bringing these RWAs on chain. And they don't have to go kind of make these deals with different lending protocols because they already have Frax lend and they're already very intertwined with curve, so they can quickly get liquidity for this new sfax token if they desire to do so. Curve also has a lending protocol, so I'm sure they'll get a plug in there as well. And now you see why their whole thesis was the trinity. And let's build out every layer of the stack such that when we launch new products, we're kind of already primed to be in a very good position and get the product in the hands of the users and also make it a better product. Right. Especially for stablecoins and tokens.
00:09:17.210 - 00:09:27.650, Speaker D: Liquidity is a very important piece of the puzzle, and this is something that they worked really hard to get really good at, and that's showing off. So again, really excited for this one to come live. Yeah.
00:09:27.720 - 00:09:49.750, Speaker C: I also wanted to highlight that they're actually integrating with stripe, so once the actual entity is in full force, they're going to have a constant API and dashboard that will show real time what the bank accounts are looking like. So that's going to be pretty neat. Probably like the most transparent thing we've seen to the minute in defi.
00:09:50.670 - 00:10:15.666, Speaker B: That's actually super cool. I didn't realize stripe was that into, I guess, on chain, off chain reporting. It's almost like they're acting as an oracle of sorts. That's super interesting. I wonder if they'll have KYC requirements or something, because that is something I noticed on Ondo. They've kind of grown to 200 million TVL with just T bills tokenized really quickly. But you got to KYC in order to actually interact with it.
00:10:15.666 - 00:10:18.980, Speaker B: So. Curious if that's a route frax will take or not.
00:10:19.750 - 00:10:29.300, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll see how long the meta even lasts before Gary cracks down on everyone, because we are just passing on treasury yields to random people online.
00:10:30.810 - 00:11:05.060, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I always go back and forth on this. On one hand it's like, oh, well, that's a no brainer, right? Of course this is going to happen. But to your point, does there need to be regulation around this? I'd rather not peel that one back because the answer probably seems to be yes. But how do you go about enforcing that becomes this impossible to answer question? Now, regulators are going to use the fact that that's impossible to answer question as a reason why you shouldn't be allowed to do it, when the reality is that's a really shitty reason to prevent people from getting access to better financial instruments. So definitely a lot of work to do on that front.
00:11:06.070 - 00:11:59.010, Speaker A: Correct me if I'm wrong, but Paxos is in partnership, right, with fracs in some form or fashion. I think that having a centralized entity like Paxos, the size of them, I think you're definitely going to be able to. FrACs could be able to leverage their legal teams as like a buffer from US government overreach. Whereas maker, going back to your point, Dan, they try to do more distributed RWA strategy where Maker really has no one legal team or one entity to rely on. So it's good in a way, but at the same time, if you're going to leverage centralized assets, then why not have a centralized strategy? So I'm honestly fully in favor of what Prax is doing. I'm pretty bullish on what they're doing, and I think their partnership with Paxos is probably going to be a potential kingmaker strategy leading into the next cycle.
00:12:00.070 - 00:12:12.680, Speaker C: Well, allegedly Sam K was at lunch with rune the other day, so maybe Maker is going to take their stuff and plug it in to finres and we'll go from there.
00:12:15.770 - 00:12:39.786, Speaker A: That'd be a pretty interesting imagine like an M A of Frax and maker that'd actually be pretty cool. We don't need two decentralized, stable coins. Like, let's just call it what it is. We need one. And I think they went on two different. Like, they started off at two different approaches. I think maker tried to do more safety strategy, whereas Frac kind of went a little more djen.
00:12:39.786 - 00:13:09.240, Speaker A: They tried to get protocols to leverage them, whereas I think Dai went along the lines, let's try to get retail participants to hold Dai. But they're kind of now converging on the same vision at the end of the day, which I think is the correct one. But I would love to see bear markets, in my opinion, are for M A's figure out, get rid of the inefficiencies in the system. I think there's a lot of synergies between those two protocols. I would love to see that happen. Doubt it ever does, though.
00:13:09.850 - 00:13:30.960, Speaker D: We'd have to come up with a new name like Faye and Rari merging the attempted merger. There was Ferrari. This fits so naturally, but I don't know if we can mash these two together in a fancy way. Fraxdow, Fraxer, fracker. We're going to have to cut. Right. All right, David, who do you got in the hot seat cool throne this week?
00:13:31.650 - 00:14:17.630, Speaker A: Yeah, I have the Cosmos hub and its community on the cool throne this week. So a couple of months ago, they launched replicate security. They have a couple of consumer chains that are now leveraging the cosmos hub security. But I think back in, I want to say Q four of 2022, the community approved a proposal to actually invest in protocols to leverage the Cosmos hub security. So it's kind of like a business development initiative. And they invested in Neutron, which is a Cosmosm smart contract platform. I believe the P to P team, which is one of the Genesis validators for Cosmos and also one of the Genesis team founding teams of Lido.
00:14:17.630 - 00:15:02.806, Speaker A: The P to B team kind of incubated neutron, and there was originally an airdrop for atom stakers and for other people in the cosmos ecosystem to claim neutron tokens. A good majority, I think, because it's a bear market, not a lot of people are paying attention. A good majority of those tokens went unclaimed. And just late last week, a proposal was put up by the neutron founding team to transfer all the unclaimed neutron to the Cosmos hub treasury. So back in Q four, 2022, the Cosmos hub invested about like $500,000, approximately in neutron. And today, those tokens, it's about 4.3% of the total neutron supply.
00:15:02.806 - 00:15:52.102, Speaker A: And it's about 28% of the current circulating supply. Neutron. That amount that will be transferred or potentially transferred to the Cosmos hub Treasury equates to about $18 million. That's about like a 36 x return on that investment, which is kind of interesting because it's kind of like a VC style bet. Not only is the cosmos hub gaining revenue share from these protocols, leveraging its security provision, but now it's actually getting upside in the protocols that are in this atom economic zone or in this larger ecosystem built around the hub. Now, one of the interesting things that I think you're seeing being discussed in the Cosmos hub forums is like, what do you do with this neutron? There's also talks about potentially doing treasury swaps or strides. What do you do with these tokens that are sitting in your treasury? Ideally, you want to put them to work, you want them to be productive assets.
00:15:52.102 - 00:16:26.866, Speaker A: You can actually start seeing a vision where the hub actually leverages like protocol and liquidity. So it takes this neutron, it pairs it with some of the atom inside its treasury. It deploys it in a liquidity pool, or like a Dex on neutron, or some other chain in the wider atom economics zone, or even the wider interchange. Now it becomes like a productive asset to drive additional revenue back to the hub. I'm really bullish on this concept. The idea of protocol and liquidity obviously was thought of by Olympusdao. And then I think like Faye at the time and Feyrari merger was pretty bullish on the idea of protocol and liquidity.
00:16:26.866 - 00:17:10.562, Speaker A: Frax obviously is like a market leader in this concept. I think there's a huge design space for protocol and liquidity. When you combine on chain governance with shared security, I think it has a lot of potential to actually have these bilateral chain agreements. So what I mean by that is, if you look at the L two space today, there's a lot of other shared security models out there. There's Eigen layer, there's polka dot, there's the L two S leveraging ETH security. What I like to say is you see the l two s aligning with Ethereum, but Ethereum isn't aligned with the L two S because Ethereum is like a credibly neutral base layer. But once you actually start having subjectivity, once you start having intention, it's like the hub is aligning with you and you're aligning with the hub.
00:17:10.562 - 00:17:47.410, Speaker A: I actually think you can have really interesting. It's beyond just shared security. It's like shared alignment for economic development, shared political alignment shared social alignment. And I think this is kind of like an emerging idea that you're seeing in the cosmos ecosystem that I think is like a really interesting market differentiator or product differentiator from the other shared security models out there. So this is like the first iteration of this I'm really excited to see. I'm assuming this is going to pass in the coming weeks once it goes on chain, but the hub just was able to diversify treasury, get a cool $18 million, and potentially put that to work on behalf of its stakers.
00:17:48.950 - 00:18:10.582, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I love that you flagged this. And it's pretty cool to see in the atom 2.0 white paper being, I think they called it the allocator. Dow. This is kind of the goal of getting involved in these types of deals, and really it's beneficial to them because it's helping to power this broader atom economic zone. So really kind of cool to see early inklings of what that would look like. And of course, this one seems to be going quite well.
00:18:10.582 - 00:18:12.780, Speaker D: So kudos to that team.
00:18:13.390 - 00:18:45.118, Speaker B: I just don't understand what they're going to do with it. Still, even after you said that to me, I feel like what cosmos needs the most is liquidity. But if you pair that against Adam, which is really the only asset, realistically, you could pair it against. If it's Pol for the hub, then I feel like Adam just going to become this constant source of exit liquidity, considering it's one of the few assets in the cosmos ecosystem that actually has the depth on order books to put on that kind of size. So I don't know. I don't see how that problem gets solved.
00:18:45.294 - 00:19:28.190, Speaker D: I think you would actually even take that a step further. Like, ask the question, why does neutron have a token if it's going to be a general purpose l one blockchain, there's only a couple of ways that it can really derive value, right? So it's either going to be like a cash flow generating asset. Like, you want to stake this asset and earn not only just, like, inflationary yield. Right. But also real yield through transaction fees or anything else adjacent to the block space, like, say, maybe MeV boost payments through in Ethereum. This could be an in demand as a gas token, right? Like, there's an economy that exists on top of the neutron chain itself, and the users that are very much so want to interact with this. And so the token kind of has, like, commodity value because you need it to operate the chain.
00:19:28.190 - 00:19:40.534, Speaker D: It could also be used as a medium of exchange within that. So like, common base pair for Dexes or the medium of exchange for NFTs, right? Or maybe it's like the last reason would be to be like, is this respected store of value, right?
00:19:40.572 - 00:19:40.774, Speaker A: Something.
00:19:40.812 - 00:19:54.090, Speaker D: The digital cold thesis that bitcoin is very much chasing after. And I honestly don't know which one of those buckets would make the most sense for neutron to fall into. So that's kind of the question I would pose here, is why does Neutron have a token?
00:19:54.910 - 00:20:36.406, Speaker A: Yeah, this is actually a pretty, like, I wouldn't say hotly debated, but there was a lot of conversation around this last year, towards the end of last year, when the hub initially invested in neutron and the prevailing discussion, or the prevailing result was, well, we believe in sovereignty, in the cosmos ecosystem. In order for sovereignty, you need to have your own sovereign governance structure. In order to have your own sovereign governance structure, you need a cyber resistance mechanism. And that is the token. So the way neutron's tokenomics work is, there's a set amount. There's only a billion, I believe, not in circulation, but in total supply and on neutron. And not even just neutron, other cosmo chains as well.
00:20:36.406 - 00:21:21.606, Speaker A: You can actually pay in multiple gas tokens. So you can pay in atom, you can pay in USDC, you can pay in neutron. And the way the tokenomics for neutron works is any gas fees or MEV payments paid in neutron is burned. A portion of that gets sent over to the cosmos hub as part of like, the revenue share agreement. But anything that's paid in atom or USDC or any other gas token that neutron accepts as a gas fee payment goes into the neutron treasury. So the increase in economic activity actually leads to an automatic diversification of its treasury, and it also creates deflation of the asset at the same time. And kind of has like this, I won't say moneyness, but store of value or this digital scarcity meme that I think has prevailed throughout crypto over the past couple of years.
00:21:21.606 - 00:21:55.162, Speaker A: It's a really interesting concept because again, it creates deflation. There's a deflationary mechanism to it, a diversification of treasury, which could directly correlate it to the on chain economic activity. And obviously, ultimately there's governance rights associated with it too. But yeah, I think it really came down to sovereignty and governance rights. And the whole belief in cosmos ecosystem, again, is like sovereignty. So just because you're an atom economic zone, or just because you're a cosmos hub secured chain today doesn't mean you have to be one tomorrow. Eventually you might escape velocity, spin, off become your own sovereign entity.
00:21:55.162 - 00:22:24.134, Speaker A: And then the idea is like, well, what does the cosmos hub do? Obviously, we want these chains to be successful. It's an inevitability that if you're a successful chain, you're going to want to become a sovereign chain. So the other idea is like security is a commoditized service provision. Ethereum is a great example. Ethereum is a great settlement DA layer. Today. If Celestia comes online in this quarter, which it's supposed to, and it's actually ten x cheaper as a DA layer.
00:22:24.134 - 00:22:53.694, Speaker A: And settlement is not a large revenue driver for layer ones. It's like $100 per day. I think most l two s pay to settle on Ethereum. That's not going to be a large revenue driver. And ultimately this is a race to zero. Infrastructure is usually a commoditized sector. Why won't l two s just decide to leverage Celestia for DA? Because they're not locked into Ethereum, they're locked into ETH, the asset, which kind of aligns itself, like from a settlement perspective, they want the ETH native asset.
00:22:53.694 - 00:23:32.798, Speaker A: But where I was going with this is as a shared security provider, the hub, that's not where it's going to make most of its money. You need a second order or tertiary lock in mechanism. And that's where providing liquidity for consumer chains to actually jumpstart the economic engine is something really interesting where you're starting to see these bilateral agreements take shape. And I'm really excited about this concept. But to your point, Sam, maybe the hub ends up being legs of liquidity. But I think it's pretty interesting if you're seeing strategic allocation of capital, whereas I think ethereum, the L two s today, it's all mercenary. It's all private mercenary capital going from one yield farm to the other.
00:23:32.798 - 00:23:56.230, Speaker A: But if the hub actually has a shared interest in seeing neutron succeed, it can deploy capital that those chains know is sticky. But in the event that neutrons decide to spin out one day, as long as the hub maintains ownership of the neutron that it was allocated, it can actually eventually generate additional revenue from this new sovereign chain just because it has a large ownership of its supply.
00:23:58.730 - 00:24:37.282, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it's really interesting to think about that because this kind of parlays into my hot seat cool throne this week. And just like the idea of when do you need an app chain and when does it make the most sense, and how are you going to go construct that app chain? And today, that's very much so in the cosmos ecosystem but with the rise of the modular thesis, I had to put eclipse on the cool throne this week. I'm super excited about what they're doing. So they've announced that maybe ropes as a service isn't going to be their main focus. Neil has been pretty vocal on Twitter about, I think he's tweeted something to the effect of ropes as a service is dead. And then I think a lot of that has to do. This is just my interpretation.
00:24:37.282 - 00:25:39.474, Speaker D: But around the economics, how are you going to make money in that position as the provider? And who's the demand going to come from? Like who wants to build in a rope as a service environment? And so basically what they've announced is, hey, we'll keep working on that on the back burner, but our priority now is going to be building an ETH L two, and we're going to do it a bit differently than all the other l two s by using the SVM for execution. So borrowing from the Salana ecosystem and then leveraging Celestia for DAA. So I am dubbing this the optimist prime of blockchains because it's like basically picking the most optimized piece of every layer in the stack that exists today. Right? Ethereum for settlement will bring the liquidity of Ethereum because the smart contract bridge will live on Ethereum, so super easy for Ethereum users to interact with. Celestio is built specifically for DA that should be able to give you the best DA solution and save you a majority of your costs. Right now, ETH is significantly more expensive to use for DA. And then of course, the SVM is all about speed.
00:25:39.474 - 00:26:28.706, Speaker D: So we're going to see a really interesting environment here again, because this is like the most optimized blockchain you could really build today, and someone's actually doing it. So this is definitely bullish for Ethereum, it's another l two that's going to be paying settlement fees back to the main chain. Of course, DA is largely where the bulk of costs come from, but it's, again, participating in the ethereum ecosystem. It's definitely bullish for the SVM. It's going to bring more builders that are using rust, that are comfortable with how Solana is built and how that execution environment should be interacted with. And the question really becomes, is this bullish for Solana? I would say yes, over the long horizon, because it's bringing more builders that are comfortable in this ecosystem, and that's super important. And if this roll up falls apart in any way, shape or form, which, again, yeah, I called it the optimist prime.
00:26:28.706 - 00:27:00.100, Speaker D: But if anything goes wrong at all, it can quickly become more of like a Frankenstein, where it's just like, how is this thing put together? And this doesn't make any sense for these reasons that you can really only learn from testing and prod. If any of those things happen and the chain breaks, then those builders can probably fairly simply just port that app over to Solana and there's another place to go execute it. And of course, that's interacting much more directly with the solana ecosystem. So, Netnet, I think it's like a really good experiment to be running again. This is kind of the coolest blockchain we can build today. So I'm personally very excited for what they're doing.
00:27:00.870 - 00:27:15.270, Speaker C: You did forget one more beneficiary of this, and that is eclipse swap, eclipse lend, eclipse USD. They're all just going to be pastas with ten K in them, and the tokens are going to go nuts.
00:27:16.890 - 00:27:31.082, Speaker D: You must have pulled up the DFI llama page of any of the recent l two s, wink wink. The zk crew. But they're working to fix that, I think. Actually Sparkland just announced it's going to ZK sync, so shout out to them. They actually get a real app over there.
00:27:31.136 - 00:27:42.286, Speaker C: I do like to see that they're going to be using Salana and really putting that to work. And then once you have fire dancer going live too, like, peak performance is on its way.
00:27:42.388 - 00:27:42.606, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:42.628 - 00:27:50.980, Speaker D: And they're not going to launch until Celestia is live. So we do still have a bit of time. I think that's still supposed to be before year end, so call three months.
00:27:52.950 - 00:28:15.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it'll also be interesting to see everyone always has the argument like, oh, you don't want to pay rent to Ethereum. That's going to be kind of like the opposite of what we're seeing with DyDX going from Ethereum to Cosmos, like seeing the SVM on top of Ethereum, using it for settlement. It'll be kind of cool to see just how that pans out. I guess we're getting that argument for every angle at this point.
00:28:17.950 - 00:28:35.700, Speaker D: Yeah. I was really intrigued to know more about the differences between plugging like an SVM into an EVM, but that shouldn't be a problem, apparently. I'm pretty satisfied to hear. But again, to your point, Sam, it's like, we got to see this thing in real time before I can actually believe that.
00:28:36.870 - 00:29:01.660, Speaker A: I heard on the bell curve shout out bell curve. I was listening to I guess the latest episode earlier today and I didn't know this, but they're using neon like the EVM SVM, I guess, whatever that is. The EVM to SVM compiler. They're using that to compile SVM to EVM for eclipse. That was pretty interesting. I don't know if you guys heard about that.
00:29:02.510 - 00:29:12.300, Speaker C: That's crazy. I didn't think the neon team was capable of doing anything. All that money three years later. I don't think they know what a blockchain is.
00:29:13.710 - 00:29:49.494, Speaker B: All right, while we're shitting on folks, I'll take my hot seat. I got mixin. They were hacked for $200 million. It's a Tokyo based company, I'm pretty sure. I'll be honest, I haven't actually used mixin before, so take everything I say here with a grain of salt. But their website says that they are transaction fee free, privacy preserving, and can support up to 1 million TPs and they apparently have a messaging app. Apparently their policy was to move funds from hot wallet to hot wallet every single day and they stored validator keys within a cloud provider.
00:29:49.494 - 00:30:46.294, Speaker B: I believe it's Google because they said they're currently reaching out to Google to see exactly what happened and what was the origin of the incident. Not many people talk about mix in and it's kind of funny because it's number eight or at least it was on DFI llama chains by TVL with like over 300 and 5400 million somewhere around there. But yeah, nonetheless, that's like the, I think like 6th or 7th largest bridge hack in crypto's history. That's pretty large. It's only smaller than like Ronan, BNB, wormhole poly network, and maybe like a couple others. But definitely one of the biggest of this year and kind of sucks actually because I don't know if I'm getting the right information feed, but just from my experience I'd be curious what you guys see on the timeline. But seems like Japan has been relatively crypto friendly and if this actually is an application that had significant user adoption in Japan, that's definitely like a blow.
00:30:46.294 - 00:30:52.560, Speaker B: And I feel like everyone over here in the US is just now waking up and learning what the hell mixing is, to be honest.
00:30:55.730 - 00:31:27.046, Speaker D: Yeah, that brings a total of total value exploited to $7.2 billion. Shout out DFI llama for tracking all of this for us. But that is a scary large number. And to your point, Sam, I really hate to hear assuming that's true. I can't personally verify that, of course, but really hate to hear that that would signal us like a normal people or relatively normal people, like less crypto native people that are getting impacted by this just by using a messaging app. So that's not something you want to see.
00:31:27.046 - 00:31:52.160, Speaker D: It definitely doesn't help any sort of regulatory conditions that are already facing such strong headwinds. At the end of the day, we're going to have to get this problem figured out. A $7.2 billion is a ridiculously large number. And it's like every day where you see another nine figure exploit. It feels like a lot of this gets pinged back to North Korea. And that's such a trigger word for any three letter agency as well.
00:31:52.160 - 00:32:10.120, Speaker D: It's just bringing severely unneeded attention to the wrong corners and so kind of an impossible problem to solve if you truly want an open and permissionless blockchain. But it's clearly, clearly being continually worse. I don't really know a good solution to fixing it.
00:32:11.930 - 00:32:27.660, Speaker C: It's called world app, uses worldcoin. It's on the op stack and they whitelist which contracts can be deployed. And that's why world Coin is up 75%.
00:32:28.110 - 00:32:30.650, Speaker D: Keywords open and permissionless.
00:32:32.430 - 00:32:39.802, Speaker C: I'm all for a federal chain, KYC, to get on a chain if they can guarantee my money is not going to get stolen.
00:32:39.866 - 00:32:57.830, Speaker A: I work in this industry full time. All of us work in this industry full time. And I've never heard of mixing. I saw it on the DFI llama leaderboards and never really just paid attention to it. I'm just looking at it right now. Right. Mix in $350,000,000 of tvl DFI chain, $170,000,000.
00:32:57.830 - 00:33:17.750, Speaker A: Tvl Fusion, $157,000,000. Tvl whatever. Clayton is $100 million. There are nearly a billion dollars in TVL protocols that I have never heard of. And I work in this industry full time. And it's a bear market. This is nearly a billion dollars TvL of combined.
00:33:17.750 - 00:33:28.030, Speaker A: I don't want to call them ghost chains because I don't really know anything about them, but it's pretty nuts that the amount of capital that's out there, that's like in obscure parts of crypto.
00:33:29.890 - 00:33:58.970, Speaker D: Spend 10 hours every day and there's always something new that comes up and you're like, oh, I got to check this out. And then you do, and there's continually this endless loop of evolution that is notoriously hard to keep up with, but that's kind of bullish the industry. There's that much going on that even spending 10 hours a day every day still can't get you down that far down the list. That probably wraps it up for our hot seat cool throne. So let's move on to our next segment here. Going to be our governance update. Might be a bear market like David just mentioned, but there's still a ton going on in governance.
00:33:58.970 - 00:34:39.638, Speaker D: Most recently, Arbitrum had a snapshot vote to signal the community's preferences for an incentives program. So distributing some of the ARB in the Dow treasury, they signaled support for 50 million. And so now we're in the step of. All right, if you're a protocol, give us an application requesting some amount of ARB explaining why and how you're going to use it, and then the Dow will go through and approve those. So, of the applications that have came in, which I've seen about 20 or so, the largest requests are radiant for up to 3.3 million, wormhole for two and a half million. Ramsay's, beefy and Magpie all coming in at 2 million.
00:34:39.638 - 00:35:24.786, Speaker D: And so some of these protocols, the airdrop, is pretty meaningful relative to their circulating supply and fully diluted valuations. And so there could definitely be some interesting plays here if you're looking to scalp some tokens. But to me, the question really is, all right, we're in the middle of a bear market. Does this really make sense to be allocating $50 million or 50 million ARB tokens to defi incentives? Like right now? Feels like if you waited a couple of months, you might be getting a little better bang for your buck. Of course, the flip side, there is, yeah, there's some couple of billion tokens in the Dow treasury. So it's like 50 million really doesn't make a dent. And if that does kind of keep the lights on and keep attention focused on your l two during this kind of very dead period, maybe the trade off is there.
00:35:24.786 - 00:35:27.720, Speaker D: So I'm curious if you have a take on this.
00:35:29.050 - 00:36:16.134, Speaker B: I think I'd say I'm all for it, honestly. I mean, op has got so much momentum, you've got so many l two s launching. I do think that the Dow has a responsibility to make sure that they're remaining competitive. And if 50 million ARB can do that over the next three months, especially in a way that's not super harmful to the token and just promoting farm and dumping, then I think that's great. I know that making these incentive programs is incredibly difficult, and that's why they're doing, like, a review process and having protocols, submit applications. But I do feel like there is some things that could have been done differently that would promote less, I guess just farm and dumping in its current structure. And to be honest, I haven't put, like a ton of thought into it, so I don't know exactly what it would look like.
00:36:16.134 - 00:36:29.094, Speaker B: But, yeah, I hear your sentiment, Dan. It's like, damn, is this $45 million actually going to make meaningful change, or is it just exit liquidity for some people?
00:36:29.292 - 00:36:34.700, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm with you there. It's just going to be after this real time experiment we're running.
00:36:35.470 - 00:37:02.900, Speaker C: I think it's fine. It's like when you're a kid and you were at the checkout line with your parents at the grocery store and you ask for a candy bar. 50 mil Arb is not a ton to them, so they'll give us this little candy bar as a treat, and it'll keep us happy for a few more months. It's better to try to keep Arb alive than let it wither out completely and then try to resurrect it from nothing.
00:37:04.870 - 00:37:31.774, Speaker A: I think this is a complete waste of money. I think. Would you say one of the pro girls named Magpie or something? I'm not giving $50 million out. Just like, yeah, even if it is a small amount of money, even if it's like candy bar amount of dollars compared to the treasury, can we do something productive with this? We know it's going to be exit liquidity. We know it's going to be sold off. Arbitrum is down 48% since it launched in what, March. Optimism is also down like 48, 50%, too.
00:37:31.774 - 00:38:25.066, Speaker A: So relatively speaking, it's along the same lines. The base announcement has not helped optimism price relative to Arbitrum. But Arbitrum needs to find an institutional partner, an enterprise partner that it can claim is on par with Coinbase, which there's really not many, especially in this bear market right now, but maybe earmark that for specifically go to the Dow, say, let's take this $50 million, or however much money it is, and let's specifically use it for a large enterprise that wants to build on orbit. Orbit has gotten zero traction. I think I saw the other day that arbitrum was saying how so many chains are using the orbit, and it's not like a shot at arbitrum team by any means. They're doing really good work. But let's be honest, most of the mind share has been taken by optimism for right, wrong, or indifferent.
00:38:25.066 - 00:39:05.580, Speaker A: But it's like, let's use this money for something productive. Let's not just throw it at these faceless defi protocols like the faceless users of them. That's not how you're actually going to win this long term. You need to actually find sustainable partners to have the arbitram stack actually flourish. So I'd rather just save it for a rainy day, use it strategically, but maybe specifically earmark it and tell the community this is for a large enterprise user that's not just going to take our tokens and dump it. We're not going to do what GameStop did to IMX, right? They got the tokens and they immediately dumped it on the market. We're not going to do a polygon where we announced Reddit, but nobody actually ends up using it.
00:39:05.580 - 00:39:20.026, Speaker A: All those announcements actually ended up have not helped polygon at all, in my opinion. Find something that's actually going to benefit the arbitrage token holders in the long run because it definitely damn sure is not just like giving out incentives to random D five protocols.
00:39:20.138 - 00:40:00.262, Speaker D: Bang bang, shots fired from effort capital. Hit him in the DMs if he just offended you. But I do appreciate the long response there because I could quickly look up the Dow treasury has about 3.6 billion arb tokens. So 50 million is like, what? Right? Around 1% of that kind of hear both points. I don't really have a strong opinion on this one, but moving on in more governance updates, Vesta finance, a lending protocol, has got an RFV trade going for it. So the DAO voted for a full unwind and dissolution of the protocol, which would stop the vesting of team tokens and accelerate investor allocations, leading to a full redemption of the treasury.
00:40:00.262 - 00:40:31.542, Speaker D: So the treasury value per the FDV would be about 53 ish cents. And the token was trading at beginning of the month has already run up to. So our RFV trade fanatics are winning yet again. I guess that's the right thing to do. If the protocol is deemed to be dead, then return the value to the token holders. That's kind of like definitely the appropriate thing to do. Of course, there's still a long list of steps that needed to be completed for this to actually happen, but we're seeing more and more of this.
00:40:31.542 - 00:40:38.570, Speaker D: The nouns Dow recently voted to kind of have the rage quit option. You're seeing the redemption here, and it's becoming a little bit of a trend.
00:40:39.870 - 00:41:23.880, Speaker C: Yeah, the most complex part of this is one it's front ran super heavily, like all the people who got in at what, $0.12 earlier this month to where it's not even worth one of us going in there and trying to complete the trade for this, like 10%, because you have no idea how long it's going to take. The actual rest of the proposal to be seen through. We don't know how long it's going to take before there's actually something you can redeem for. And they've obviously got to remove all the liquidity, all the protocol and liquidity in the pool. So what is that even going to be valued at by the time this all plays out?
00:41:24.890 - 00:41:38.940, Speaker B: Yeah. And then on top of that, I'm going to doubt that this is all going to be automated. I'm sure we're relying on two or three individuals to do right by the Dow and just return it. And, yeah, you can't get me to do that for 10% or 15%. Zero chance.
00:41:40.990 - 00:42:05.140, Speaker D: Yes, I'm with you guys there as well. And one last governance update. We have the maker debt ceiling. Actually, two more governance updates. The maker debt ceiling maker just voted to increase the debt ceiling on its two largest RWA vaults, or, sorry, that's still a live vote, but jumping from 1.2 billion to 3 billion and dramatically increasing its revenue run rate. I think the rough increase was about 80 million.
00:42:05.140 - 00:42:30.300, Speaker D: So it's a material change in the Dow's revenue. I think they're doing roughly 100 now. And so this will be annualized, of course. And so it's pretty exciting to see these developments playing through. Makerdao is just on this nonstop war path right now. It's like while many projects are struggling and Vesta finance is shutting down, Makerdow keeps chugging along and is really focused on their RWA strategy and how to bring that yield on chain. So super exciting to see here as well.
00:42:32.270 - 00:42:53.966, Speaker A: I'm so bullish. Yeah. Historically, you can argue the MKR token has really done nothing. The maker burn really did not actually end up generating real value or real demand for the asset. But I think it's RWA strategy. They're going heavy into it. Obviously, they're going to be able to generate over $100 million in profit.
00:42:53.966 - 00:43:26.458, Speaker A: Like, not even revenue, like actual profit. It's an ultimately unlimited, scalable business, assuming the government, the Fed, doesn't come and take their assets away or seize them. But the RWA play allows them to increase their fundamental floor for what makers should be valued at as a cash generating protocol. And then on top of that, now you're actually with the end game. You're going to see all these subdals pop up, they're trying to align with Maker. Spark protocol is one of them. But you're now owning maker.
00:43:26.458 - 00:44:02.890, Speaker A: Owning Dai is actually going to be required in order to farm these subdow protocols. So not only does maker get you upside in the RWA narrative, now you're actually getting upside in volatile tokens that are potentially going to become major defi players in the next cycle. I think it's one of the best plays, I think, of the next cycle. I wouldn't know how it's not. Yeah, it's not the most Ponzi nomic type protocol out there, but I think in terms of has long term staying power in terms of the brand. Brune's been here for multiple cycles. He's the earliest DeFi protocol in existence.
00:44:02.890 - 00:44:16.720, Speaker A: I think the end game is putting a lot of attention on maker itself, and I definitely think it's like one of the best plays for the foreseeable future. Not financial advice. And I don't own any MKR today.
00:44:18.130 - 00:44:35.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I just love the anti cyclicality, if you will. As soon as the market goes risk on, people are going to be borrowing against crypto assets, paying interest rates, and then as soon as everyone goes risk off, which is usually the other direction of rates, then you're sitting cozy in T bills. So I agree. I love it.
00:44:37.190 - 00:45:01.878, Speaker D: Now, the last governance update, we moving back to the cosmos ecosystem. The blockworks research team has actually put together two really interesting forum posts. And of course, that effort was championed by none other than effort capital, no pun intended, but I'm going to start doing that more often. So, effort, why don't you tell us a little bit more about the monetary and fiscal policy changes to Adam that have been proposed over the past week.
00:45:01.904 - 00:45:50.806, Speaker A: And a half or so? We put together a proposal to the cosmos hub community as part of this grant work that we got from atom accelerator to reimagine the tokenomics of the cosmos hub and specifically the atom asset. So there's like this prevailing narrative, or I guess you could say over the last cycle, you think of ETH as money. Bitcoin is money. You can argue maybe to some degree, that Solana is money for its given ecosystem, because not only did people want to hold it, but you actually had to use it. You had to use it as a medium of exchange. You had to actually use it for utility purposes, to actually pay for computational resources on the network. A lot of the people outside looking in never thought that Adam was money, because it was not forced upon you as a cosmos ecosystem user.
00:45:50.806 - 00:46:16.254, Speaker A: If I wanted to go on osmosis and do a swap, I didn't need to pay an atom. You can. It accepts Adam as gas. I didn't need to. And I think by not forcing that on you, in addition to other reasons on the outside looking in, it was never considered as money. But if you actually look at how Adam has performed across other chains in the clear, like it clearly has outperformed. I call this like the numerair.
00:46:16.254 - 00:46:43.750, Speaker A: It is the asset that everything else in the cosmos ecosystem is compared to, for one reason or the other. I think a lot of money, like the concept of money, is very much like a social construct. There is a reason to. There's certain things that can, tangible things, like medium of exchange, actually using it for gas. That I think reinforces social construct of moneyness. Like ETH, is mostly money because people want to hold it and people think it's money, not because you can use it on the network. At least that's my personal opinion.
00:46:43.750 - 00:47:26.586, Speaker A: The reason why I'm bringing this up is because you're starting to see with this new atom economic zone, these narratives starting to play out a lot of other tokens. Chains like Neutron and stride are actually going to start allowing atom to be used as gas on the network. I think like 75% plus of all transactions on neutron are actually being paid in atom and not neutron, like the native token for the chain, which is really interesting. But people have historically wanted to hold atom, and in my opinion, that makes it money. Now, in order to reinforce this money thesis, one of the problems with Adam's monetary policy or its supply schedule is that it has a dynamic inflation model, if you don't know that. So, like most proof of stake networks, like Salana, for example, there's a set supply schedule. I think it goes down like 15% year over year.
00:47:26.586 - 00:48:06.774, Speaker A: It's inflation until it reaches like, a base level of one and a half percent. And there's something nice about that. You have certainty around what you're getting. You know, in a year from now, how much Salana there's going to be, in five years from now, how much sold there's going to be. But the cosmos hub, atom in particular, has a dynamic inflation model that's based on the amount of atom that's staked to the network as a function of its total supply. If more than 66% of the supply of atom is staked to the cosmos hub, inflation goes down until it hits a minimum of 7%. If less than 66% of the supply is staked, then it can hyperinflate essentially to about 20%.
00:48:06.774 - 00:49:08.694, Speaker A: It changes block by block. Long story short, this uncertainty, in my opinion, hurts the monetary premium of atom, on top of the other reasons why people don't consider money outside of the cosmos ecosystem, because again, it's not used as gas, et cetera, et cetera. But the reason why this monetary policy was created initially was because it actually foresaw the belief of like DFI. If you're holding Ethereum, let's say, and Ethereum is paying you 5% yield, would you rather stake to the network for 5% yield? Or would you rather go borrow it or lend it out on ave for 6% yield or 7% yield? The idea was that the proof of stake network can actually compete with DFI yields to ultimately make the proof of stake network secure. Liquid staking blew the cans open and opened up a can of worms for proof of stake networks. Now you don't have to actually choose one or the other. You can actually stake to the network, get the staking issuance yields, and what other yield that proof of stake network is generating, and you can actually leverage that yield to also deposit collateral in DeFi.
00:49:08.694 - 00:49:57.270, Speaker A: Obviously staked ETH huge Boon like Lido is absolutely killing it over this past cycle. But long story short, what we proposed the monetary policy change to Adam is like, in this new liquid staking world, you don't need dynamic inflation. The proof of stake network no longer needs to compete with the defi yield. Now that you can double dip, let's create a more certainty around the supply. So long story short, we propose to decrease the inflation of atom on a very similar type of schedule that Salana proposes. What this ends up creating is like about 100 million less atoms minted by the end of the decade. There's some really good conversation going on in the community right now, whether is that good? Why is it good? Also, what are the bad things? A lot of validators make money off of the inflation.
00:49:57.270 - 00:50:48.650, Speaker A: So we propose a pretty aggressive tapering of inflation over the next few years. And they're concerned that, hey, if the atom economic zone doesn't generate sustainable revenue, this could be actually bad for our business, which is a very valid concern. But there's a lot of conversation going on in the forums around that. And then the second thing, which I think I'm really excited about, is this idea of a dynamic liquid staking tax. So if you look at Lido right now, there's a whole bunch of conversation and debates going on in the theorem ecosystem about how Lido has like an overwhelming monopoly of liquid staked ETH, and that if it passes critical consensus threshold of 33%, then Lido can effectively control ethereum, the network. Lido governments can shut down Ethereum if it really wanted to. And now, like Lido is kind of like this governance wrapper over Ethereum, which was inherently not supposed to have on chain governance.
00:50:48.650 - 00:51:54.990, Speaker A: There's something called the liquid staking module that the cosmos hub implemented with its most recent upgrade that allows the hub actually to be cognizant of how much atom is staked to the network. I'm sorry, of how much atom is liquid staked. Something that I think the Ethereum foundation is actually researching and potentially going to bring over to the ethereum network, which will be really exciting. But what we propose is if the hub is cognizant, and if liquid staking poses this potential existential risk for all proof of stake networks, and if the hub is actually be able to be cognizant of how much is liquid staked of its own asset, then why not create like a market for it? If there's concerns around too much liquid staking, even though it's an inevitability, let the hub actually benefit from the growth of liquid staking. In theory, since the hub doesn't have smart contract capability, the growth of liquid staking should lead to the increased economic activity of the atom economic zone built around the hub. Ethereum increased economic activity leads to more burn. But what if we were able to actually tax the growth of liquid staking so that the market finds its own equilibrium for how much should be liquid staked and how much shouldn't be.
00:51:54.990 - 00:52:49.122, Speaker A: And the more liquid staking there is, the higher the taxes. And then what we could do is actually burn this tax and not necessarily create a deflationary item, but lower the inflation further, so it has more sound moneyness that I think the crypto space likes to look at in terms of what assets should we invest in? You could also use this tax revenue to leverage protocol liquidity, which we talked about earlier today, and generate more revenue for hub stakers. But long story short, again, there's a lot of exciting stuff going on in the cosmos ecosystem, particularly with the hub. Blockbuster research is like a major part of this conversation about how to change the tokenomics for the hub and Adams, that's like a more sought after asset, so that it can actually generate more economic activity in the wider Adam economic zone. I'm going to be giving a talk about this at Cosmoverse, which I'm really excited about on day one. Monday next week. And, yeah, that's kind of what we're building.
00:52:49.122 - 00:53:28.400, Speaker A: And one of the things that I think is one question I want to pose to you guys is you're seeing conversations about Lido offer dual governance to stake these holders. So staked holders can actually to more closely align Lido with Ethereum protocol. Staked holders can have governance rights over Lido. The big difference is, like, in the cosmos ecosystem, it's a proof of stake network that has on chain governance. Should liquid stakers have the same governance rights that native stakers should? Because that creates some potentially interesting security concerns. If you don't need to actually bond your assets to the network and can just bite off.
00:53:29.490 - 00:54:19.994, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. That was a really good summary of kind of the ideas that we worked on and how we think it will benefit not only Adam the asset but Adam the network, more importantly, and really just kind of improving that money like narrative. I think the most interesting thing is the LST tax. I wouldn't be surprised if this is another moment where the cosmos front ran Ethereum to something. So it'll be very interesting to see if that plays out over the long term. But more specifically, to your question, it's super interesting because Lido and staked ETH, like, they're going to give the staked ETH voters veto rights over Lido's protocol, which is the big difference here, is like, yes, staked ETH users are basically the customers of Lido. And yeah, your customers maybe should have a voice in the future direction of the protocol.
00:54:19.994 - 00:54:57.786, Speaker D: That was kind of the whole point of a governance token in the first place. So that seems like a pretty natural fit there. But when you asked this question earlier in our group chat, I was confused. I was like, it seemed like a no brainer to me. But then you're like, well, yeah, but there is a huge risk in somebody being like, let's just say person a pushes forward a malicious proposal and then uses wallet B. It's still person a controlling a different wallet to just go smash bids, liquid staked atom vote on the proposal and then immediately dump it and like, yeah, you're going to take a haircut there, but that isn't bonding your assets for a 21 day period. To be able to vote on this thing and then withdraw them and then sell them.
00:54:57.786 - 00:55:09.200, Speaker D: There's a very different purpose. And correct me if I'm wrong here, but the 21 day unbonding period is specifically put in place to mitigate the governance attacks. Is that piece correct?
00:55:10.770 - 00:55:36.374, Speaker A: The original reason for. I think that's like a second order effect. The first reason was to prevent long range attacks that proof of stake networks, like, inherently have. But I think Babylon chain is supposed to help fix that if you use bitcoin work networks. But I think there's also a governance aspect to it too. Like if you were staking for 21 days. Typically, governance in Cosmos takes like 14 to 21 days to vote on things.
00:55:36.374 - 00:55:40.390, Speaker A: So it does kind of closely align with this 21 day unbonding period.
00:55:41.370 - 00:55:53.050, Speaker D: Okay, so more of a second order effect, but that still makes a ton of sense. And now that you mentioned that, I've yelled at you about this before, but we have got to cut down the 14 day voting period. That's ridiculous.
00:55:54.030 - 00:56:07.842, Speaker A: I agree. This conversation about extending it. They think the hub is moving too quick. And I was like, guys, the hub hasn't done shit in two years. And we've seen Salon and avalanche pop up. The hub needs to move quicker. And they're like, no, we don't want to move fast and break things.
00:56:07.842 - 00:56:13.890, Speaker A: I was like, no, that's exactly what we want to do. We're on the cutting edge of everything right here in crypto. We can't move slow.
00:56:15.670 - 00:57:00.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. A couple of us talked about too. Maybe the idea of having the LST holders have to hold that token for X amount of time, like maybe a week, but then you run into problems like, okay, what if I'm lping? There's just so much shit that happens in defi, and the whole point of having an LST is to have that liquidity and be able to make it work. So I'm sure that integration would be pretty tough. And then I know Westy said, well, what know, maybe locking up post vote for like three or four days, the token holdings, which that might work, but again, kind of the same thing. So I don't really know the right answer here, but I do think you absolutely need some kind of fallback failsafe mechanism in the case that there is a governance attack, because that's clearly a real risk here.
00:57:01.670 - 00:57:23.020, Speaker C: I think you just make their governance power, or their voting power of the liquid staked holders, make it a fraction of what an actual asset holder would have. Just run some actual math on it, but maybe they get like 10% of the voting power that having one actual token would be.
00:57:24.270 - 00:57:33.100, Speaker B: My problem with that is aren't you giving all the voting power to the validators? Don't you actually want the users, the funds, et cetera, to have that voting power.
00:57:35.870 - 00:57:37.260, Speaker C: Can have a little bit?
00:57:37.730 - 00:58:24.966, Speaker A: It's a double edged sword. I actually think that what if all liquid staked atom, for example, could not have more than 33% vote power for the hub? So no matter how much you voted, no matter how much liquid staked atom there was out there, it could never cross like a threshold specifically of governance authority. That would be pretty interesting. But I also think, Sam, like you're right, you also want to give people. Part of the reason why we have these proof of stake sets, at least for on chain governance, is there's a governance factor to it, like you actually have say in the protocol. But do you lose some of that say now that you are also trying to make money with your governance token? I don't know. Liquid staking overall just opened up a huge can of worms for proof of stake networks.
00:58:24.966 - 00:58:57.670, Speaker A: And it's really interesting to see what the space is going to look like in a couple of years because there's a lot of thought leaders, I think, like Hasu and what have you, that I think would say anything that limits the growth of liquid staking is naive and it's inevitable. So just embrace it with open arms and just get ready for the ride. And we figure out over time it's going to boil down to social consensus anyways. So just while you're trying to create mechanisms around it, just embrace it and just let it grow, which I think is a really fair take too. So I don't know. It's going to be interesting to see.
00:58:57.820 - 00:59:14.750, Speaker B: One more idea there. I know we all want to get off of this. We're coming up on an hour here, but what about having a quorum that needs bonded atom in order for the vote to pass? So that way validators essentially have veto rights over proposals by not voting.
00:59:16.450 - 00:59:51.022, Speaker D: So you mean like there has to be a certain number of normal bonded atom? Yeah. Okay, that's interesting. Or what if you had the liquid staking tokens, kind of like vote as a unit, right? Because depending on the proposal, they might all have them as a group has different interests per se than the hard bonded atom as a group would have. So it could be interesting to, I don't know, maybe group them as one vote somehow. I don't know how that would work, but theoretically. But it would be interesting to see either of those models.
00:59:51.106 - 00:59:52.394, Speaker A: Well, that's for another day.
00:59:52.432 - 01:00:15.646, Speaker D: Yeah, it feels like we could probably do a whole podcast on that type of topic. Or Cosmos governance as a whole. Maybe we get Sam Hart back on and it's been a while. I think he was on one of our very first episodes of Zero X research, so he's definitely due back for a second appearance. Probably a great place to wrap it up, though. Everyone, thanks a ton for listening this week. And as a reminder, we switched up the framework here.
01:00:15.646 - 01:00:28.290, Speaker D: So we're going to have two episodes per week. The first one will be the analyst episode, the second one will be the interview. This week is with the ENS founder Nick Johnston, so be on the lookout for one to drop the day after this episode. And thanks a lot guys. Cheers.
