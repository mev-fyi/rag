00:00:00.160 - 00:00:29.790, Speaker A: The question with like blockchains and being in like just these inherently global systems is what rules do you apply to the blockchain? Right now it's no rules. Anything goes on chain. Even things like tornado cash that have been sanctioned by US Governments still exist and it's maybe a little bit harder to a little more friction to interact with them, but it's physically possible. It's like, how do you think about that legality problem in the context of an inherently global system where the there's like jurisdictions that have different rules in the real world.

Boccaccio, Ryan and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects discussed. What's up guys? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. I'm Daniel Boccaccio, joined by Danny and Dan Smith from Blockworks Research and Blockworks Data, respectively, to talk about all that is happening across crypto. What's up guys? How you doing?
00:01:08.482 - 00:01:09.910, Speaker A: Pleasure to be here. B.
00:01:10.530 - 00:01:10.986, Speaker B: Good.
00:01:11.058 - 00:01:12.150, Speaker C: Bullish as always.
00:01:12.530 - 00:01:39.556, Speaker B: Very good, very good, Dan. I guess just to start us off, how did you get into crypto? Yeah, are you bullish? Do you think we've topped in private messages, Dan Smith has said that he believes that crypto has stopped but that Solana will keep going up because, I quote, the rev won't stop, baby. Is this still your position? Are you okay?
00:01:39.588 - 00:02:35.608, Speaker A: We need to fact check on all of that. Where are we? Yeah, I think I was doing some good old nothing hits like some old bitcoin ta. I'm just like doing the fractals, baby. Then looking at the time between the first all time high break of the cycle and then when you actually hit the all time high for the next cycle and ultimately when you return to that previous all time high and we're kind of like right in the middle of that range where it's like, yeah, this is about the, the time in the fractal where you expect to start running and you got about three to four to five more months before you know you've already kind of peaked and you're back in the shitstorm of things. So TLDR is enjoy it while it lasts. There are some structural changes just given the ETFs and like, dude, the most important economy in the entire world is talking about building a strategic reserve of bitcoin. I.
00:02:35.608 - 00:03:11.576, Speaker A: I just can't underplay that in my head at all. I try to write it down, try to discount it, try to bring it back to there's always cycles. But that one does feel like a structural difference in the world. The bitcoiners were always right, man. The maxis ended up being just completely right. This was ultimately what they said was going to happen. And fast forward to today and you've got this economic game theory playing out where now you see smaller Eastern European countries come out and say yeah, this bitcoin stuff, we're all in on it and the US is just giving you the opportunity to front run it if we do end up just start twapping millions of dollars.
00:03:11.576 - 00:03:49.860, Speaker A: So I think it's crazy, will that change the cycle structure? My gut says probably. But I'm also beholden to the fact that every four years like fucking clockwork, we're just back to the same spot we thought we wouldn't be at again. Now to your other claim. No, I do not think Solana will keep running if the rest of the market does not. Let's not get ridiculous. And will the Rev stop is actually a pretty good this has come up a lot on Twitter recently of people comparing ETH 2021 to Solana right now. I actually said this and had a good talk on this at the last episode of Lightspeed I was on.
00:03:49.860 - 00:04:31.046, Speaker A: But I guess I want to add a little bit more context to that from a game or a meta standpoint. I think the NFT trading on Ethan 21 is identical to trading meme coins on Solana today. It's just the best casino that the industry has to offer and on a holistic level. It's basically all we're offering today. Like trading bots for that are trading meme coins drive blockchain transaction value or rev across literally every single chain. There is no exception as it stands today. Obviously I think us as an industry want that to mature into like a more I'm going to use the word real offering, but that's not where we're at today.
00:04:31.046 - 00:05:11.866, Speaker A: And so I think the games are quite quite similar. I think there are some structural technological differences between then and now that position Solana to have a better shot at capturing the next wave of innovation on this game. And that is where ETH failed. So the fact that it costs 100 plus dollars to do a basic transfer, that is what I think shifted the attention away from Ethereum. And you can still send a subsent transaction of a USDC on Solana even though you have people like outbidding each other to trade Meme coins. So that I think is like a technological difference in the game that is again, I think that the takeaway here is this is the current game we're playing. It's Meme coins on Pump Fun.
00:05:11.866 - 00:05:24.300, Speaker A: It won't be the game forever. So how does that game evolve? And if you're Solana, you want to position yourself so you can capture that new game happening on your chain. And I think this current setup actually does exactly that.
00:05:24.600 - 00:05:43.648, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's the fair point. I'm glad that you said it's cost subset $0.01 to cents USDC and not to transact on Solana because you know my opinions on the actual fee to do stuff on solana is not sub $0.01. It's like $1314 13$14.
00:05:43.784 - 00:06:07.370, Speaker A: But I, I do agree that it's not and it makes sense, right? There's if you and somebody else might do the exact same thing. There's two ways that I know of to have like a dispute resolution there. One is what we see on most blockchains today. Priority ordering based on the amount you're willing to pay. And the other is first come, first serve. So the only chain I know that does this today is Arbitrum. Having a single sequencer I think makes this a little bit easier.
00:06:07.370 - 00:06:31.392, Speaker A: But it's whoever hits me first, I'll just put your transaction first. So there's like different that it's like a different set of trade offs around latency and collocation versus if we want to do the same thing. How bad do you want it? I'm willing to pay a dollar. If you're not willing to pay a dollar, you're in trouble. I'm going to go first and you're not going to be able to. Your transaction is going to revert. And so yeah, that's always that state contention is always going to be there.
00:06:31.392 - 00:06:45.820, Speaker A: And again, I don't know of another way to solve that other than first come first serve which has its own set of trade offs or people willing to pay more. So if we want to trade the same token at the same time, we're going to form a queue. And how do you put one person ahead of the other in the queue now? It's based on the amount you're willing to pay.
00:06:46.520 - 00:07:28.476, Speaker B: About the cycle thing, I want to get back to this. I want to talk about the cycle a little bit. I've just spent my first day thinking about the cycle today because I had another podcast in the morning where we brought up the cycle and most people seem to agree with you. Daniel Smith I guess like the data agrees with you because you looked at the data and everybody looks at the same data. The chart is the same. Everybody thinks March, five months, six months from now, we've topped. And regarding the btc, the world's second greatest power after Canada, bidding Bitcoin as a reserve, I, I think like structurally that could change.
00:07:28.476 - 00:07:53.590, Speaker B: I still think we see 55, 60 drawdown and that's like, I guess I have to say that on the pod now. But like alts I think get decimated. I don't think we have an alt super cycle, but I could see a bitcoin 45, 50, maybe 60 drawdown and then continue back up. So I think structurally that might change. It's also like it's really not worth doing this. Like I should have never gotten into this. But like in my mind that's how I think about.
00:07:53.590 - 00:08:14.772, Speaker B: I think if there's structural changes, it's for bitcoin. I don't think it's for like not even meme coins but for utility stuff, like defi stuff. I think, I mean I think soul sees probably that is 70%, 75% drawdown and I don't think that's like eth as well probably maybe not because that is an ETF, but Sol also might get an ETF. Lots of stuff that might, yeah, but.
00:08:14.796 - 00:08:46.102, Speaker A: Even the ETFs though, it's like I think that it's going to be mostly retail investors that have a simplified access and then you will get like traditional investors. But they're, you know, they're playing for like a theme or a thesis. Like they're not just like allocating for allocation sake. Maybe for bitcoin you get some of that, but I don't think you're going to get that into Ether Solana. So the question is, what is it? Right. I think you can tell a really great story around Rev for Solana today, but when you start unpacking that it's just meme coins. And meme coins are absolutely reflexive to the cycle.
00:08:46.102 - 00:09:31.120, Speaker A: So you need to start building things that are not reflective of the cycle and have sustainable demand. So you're not always having to force yourself to be open to the next iteration on the next game. So I think that's kind of the difference there. And yeah, I don't think any other tokens except for bitcoin are immune to these massive drawdowns we've historically seen. And it would be super interesting on your Point around, just timing again, this is obviously stupid, but it's fun to do anyways. Last cycle we saw that it was like an Aprilish timeframe, the first high and then a massive drawdown and then a second high I think back later in the year in November. It'd be really interesting if you see that first one come on inauguration day right around that time and then like two months down the road, three months down the road you see this like second high.
00:09:31.120 - 00:09:34.000, Speaker A: Yeah, it'd be super interesting to see that play out.
00:09:34.540 - 00:10:24.894, Speaker C: I do think I want to add a point around. I don't know that it's necessary that. I just, I feel like there is this constant like bit of virtue signaling a bit around like at some point we should replace all meme coin gambling and other like raw gambling primitives with like what is quote unquote real and like useful activity. But the like gambling or gaming industry as a whole is like that's a very large and successful industry in the real world today. So there's a future where if it's meme coins or if it's NFTs, like pick your, pick your kind of favorite. If there's some future iteration of this. I mean I do think there is a reasonable like future scenario where this sort of activity continues.
00:10:24.894 - 00:10:38.734, Speaker C: Obviously there's seasonality to this types of stuff, but I mean even sports betting, that is like an incredibly strong and growing category today that is fueled entirely by like people want to run like five leg parlays and whatnot. And that's incredibly profitable for those businesses.
00:10:38.862 - 00:10:41.294, Speaker A: Hey, don't you start shit talking five leg parlays.
00:10:41.342 - 00:11:08.032, Speaker C: I'm not, I'm not shit talking them. I'm saying like people love this concept of just like ripping 10 bucks into something that might hundred thousand million X for them, you know, in a week. And it's entirely possible that this continues. Obviously there is like you said there's some reflexivity there but I don't think there's any like reason that this has to, this has to go away. It can continue to grow from here. It could start to cannibalize like the existing like gaming industry as it exists today.
00:11:08.216 - 00:11:28.490, Speaker B: It's just not sexy though. It's like like we, we started off saying we're building independent money. God, I, I can never keep up. I want to but you know what, like it's just not sexy. It's like you can't be like oh like we're building like centralized financial primitives. The government. I don't want them to touch My money.
00:11:28.610 - 00:11:53.200, Speaker C: That's what I want to ask. Does this, does this people, people think it's like her impacting the credibility of the industry or something. They, they, they boil it down to like, well, we were doing this and it was supposed to be so like cool and impactful, but now that people are like gambling, it, it ruins all of that. I don't know. Is that something that people are juggling in their minds of like we're, we're struggling to gain any credibility when all of it is just memes?
00:11:53.540 - 00:12:33.814, Speaker B: I think it ruins it a little bit because my thing is like on, based on whatever moral morality is very different, difficult to get into now. But let's say that you as the person views Silk Road and pumped off on live streams at the same like, as the same bad thing. Like you can do the same stuff on it and make money off of it. Like the same genre of stuff. You can sell drugs, you can do drugs, whatever. But Silk Road is kind of like a you to the government versus like pump fun is like, hey guys, I need to make money. So like, I'm gonna kill this chicken.
00:12:33.814 - 00:13:04.382, Speaker B: It's not like, you know what I mean? It's like. So I think in the past we had at least like some form of like crypto money was to be anonymous and to do like silly stuff, morally ambiguous stuff, but at least like it had kind of a purpose. Now it's like, my purpose is to make a lot of money. Does it matter? I guess maybe, like it depends on your view. I agree with you. I think like gambling is a fine use case to go after. And I agree that like the ten dollar like bets probably just stay on.
00:13:04.382 - 00:13:15.006, Speaker B: And I think it's a good use case. I just don't know if it's like the sexiest use case overall after we start off by saying I'm going to be independent.
00:13:15.198 - 00:13:48.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I generally agree with that, but I guess a slightly different view. When I think about blockchains, I think they're primitives to build economies on top of. And one of the subsets of those things should, can and will be this, you know, gambling side or this gaming side or the hybrid thereof. But like, I just don't want that to be the only thing we build. There's no reason for these things to not be able to coexist. Right. Like, I think the way like Anatoly probably thinks about this is, you know, you have your fart apps of the world that make all this money.
00:13:48.600 - 00:14:24.330, Speaker A: Then you have like the things that optimize for user welfare. And not every app that gets built on a blockchain needs to have the same balance on that spectrum. Pump fun is probably not making anybody's lives better. I guess if you win at the gambling game, sure. Casino makes your life better versus, I don't know, some payments app that specialize or optimizes for getting dollars in the hands of people in emerging markets that are really interested in getting them right. That probably won't drive as much value to the base layer, but it's marginally improving people's lives. And I think the golden outcome here is you have apps all over that spectrum.
00:14:24.330 - 00:14:41.956, Speaker A: And so, yeah, I just. I just don't want. The only thing we ever achieve is to be slinging five leg parlays in the form of a mean coin. And maybe that's a new meta. Maybe we start watching meme coins that are Giants, Bengals, Steelers, and two other sports teams. That'd be interesting.
00:14:42.148 - 00:14:49.060, Speaker B: You heard it, guys. Daniel Smith is endorsing Giants, Bengals, Steelers, meme coin. Find it on Solana and do not.
00:14:49.100 - 00:14:50.520, Speaker A: This is not true.
00:14:53.600 - 00:15:18.902, Speaker B: We kind of got started on Pumped Up Fun, and I think we definitely have to talk a bit about pumped Off. Dude, they were moving weird. We, like, my favorite thing about crypto is because there's money involved, we go really, really fast. Like, we. We run stuff really, really quickly. And that means that we. We push, like, tech to the limits, the technology, but we also, like, get really crazy really quickly.
00:15:18.902 - 00:15:44.920, Speaker B: Kind of want to hear. I guess there's two sides to this. What do you think? Do you think they made the right decision by getting off? Like, cutting out the live streaming feature is question one. Question two is, do you think that this kind of stuff will get regulated away, or do you think we're going to keep blockchains as permissionless primitives? Danny, you can start.
00:15:45.050 - 00:16:14.840, Speaker C: Yeah, in the immediate term, I think that was an easy decision from the team. I mean, they're. They're at a point in their growth stage where they just don't have enough clearly, like, people or hands to do the moderation that was required of this, like, quick explosion in live streams. So I think that makes sense. Like, they can, you know, spend some money. They can get some, like, automated tools set up. They can maybe hire a few people quickly and then at some point probably turn it back on.
00:16:14.840 - 00:17:20.420, Speaker C: As far as getting regulated away, I don't really think that's an outcome here. I think more realistically, like, what we're seeing is and like, following the kind of video and live Streaming spaces for several years. Like, you see this, we, we've seen similar things happen on like the youtubes and the twitches of the world where content that is questionable. So in some cases is acted upon very quickly and in other cases is not. And in the cases where it is not, like these sort of web two businesses that, you know, kind of live on, on advertiser income, the backlash for them is really more of like this advertiser slash social impact of, you know, if people are killing animals or like, you know, I think there was this classic YouTube, like probably prank meta a few years back where it was like, you know, live in the hood, like, you know, beating up homeless people, etc. Like just doing absolutely crazy wild stuff and putting it on YouTube. Obviously sponsors do not want to put their dollars and like their image on top of this stuff.
00:17:20.420 - 00:17:57.640, Speaker C: And so there's kind of like this, this feedback loop of, you know, they pull out, you know, the money goes down for, you know, monetization goes down for certain types of things. Creators learn, they like, you know, adjust their content, YouTube adjusts like its algorithms, etc. Some time goes by and then maybe sponsors, you know, that, that issue kind of goes away and then they start sponsoring again. Obviously for pump fun, it's a little different. They're not being sponsored by like advertisers today. They're just making money directly from people trading on the platform. But there was such a visceral like backlash from on socials from, from people who have either if they're using it or not using it.
00:17:57.640 - 00:18:21.030, Speaker C: But I think like negative social backlash, like social consensus of this nature. I mean it pushes them in a very obvious direction of like there are certain things that they're going to have to limit on the platform otherwise, you know, it's going to drive a bad reputation and people won't, people won't want to use or support like their product. And I think that's kind of going to be the natural evolution. They're gonna, they're gonna step through some of these things that other platforms have had to experience in the past.
00:18:21.970 - 00:18:43.740, Speaker A: Yeah, this was like obviously the right thing to do. It wasn't that long ago we had like that like weird racist meta meme coin meta and like deck screener and all the, you know, trading front ends, censored those meme coins because like, people don't want to see that. I don't want to. I hate what. I don't know. Twitter actually does a pretty poor job of this. But like, I don't want to see murder when I'm scrolling my timeline.
00:18:43.740 - 00:19:19.520, Speaker A: And that happens on Twitter. But even you know, like, this isn't a new problem. Your point about YouTube or Twitch or any of these content platforms, this is something that they've been dealing with for a while and there's solutions to it that they can implement where especially the AI getting very good. You can put filters on top of your platform that the second something that shouldn't be shown gets shown, you just shut it down. You don't have to shut down the whole thing. So I do expect it to relaunch with some content moderation built in. But like, yeah, I think people don't want to see the fucked up shit that was going on there.
00:19:19.520 - 00:19:59.842, Speaker A: And it's like, I don't know, maybe that's too optimistic view of the world. But I, yeah, I think the other problem we have to think about here is like, all right, ignoring the moral side of this and like the things that were happening were very morally bankrupt. Like the legality side of it, like, what is legal in country A might not be illegal in country B. And the question with blockchains and being in just these inherently global systems is what rules do you apply to the blockchain? Right now it's no rules. Anything goes on chain. Even things like tornado cash that have been sanctioned by US governments still exist. And it's maybe a little bit harder to.
00:19:59.842 - 00:20:15.220, Speaker A: A little more friction to interact with them, but it's physically possible. So I don't know, it's like, how do you think about that legality problem in the context of an inherently global system where the there's like jurisdictions that have different rules in the real world.
00:20:15.600 - 00:20:39.362, Speaker B: It's a tough one. I think we could do it by gdp. So whoever has the highest GDP gets to decide on the world rules. And that seems to be the case so far. Even though we kind of like, you know, we have to act like that's not really it. No, but I completely agree with you. And on the other end, it's like, should nation states even decide on this stuff? And that's like kind of what it's like.
00:20:39.362 - 00:20:51.110, Speaker B: If we let nation states decide on the stuff, it also gets kind of bastardized. I think on the app level it should be decided and I think the app level will likely inevitably get regulated.
00:20:52.810 - 00:21:05.440, Speaker A: Even on the racist meme coin meta, those things still exist on chain. It's just like it's much harder to interact with them because the front ends are going to censor them because the front ends are run by Businesses that live in jurisdictions that have to play by rules.
00:21:06.180 - 00:21:42.294, Speaker C: Yeah, I was just gonna say I don't think anything super novel is gonna play out here. Like, you know, if you wanna go and scroll the dark web today and like look for crazy stuff, you can. It's just harder to do so. And it's not gonna be like spit right into your face. Same goes for, you know, like the Pirate Bay and wanting to like torrent files and things. Like, you know, there are countries where these things are or, you know, businesses and other entities that try to make these things hard to do. So there's just going to be this like kind of line that gets towed of, you know, how much is socially acceptable, how much is like maybe legally or acceptable in different countries.
00:21:42.294 - 00:21:59.534, Speaker C: If, if they have to like block front ends in this place or that place, there's always going to be like this easy to access, like maybe friendly for most people option and then maybe the. The harder to get at and maybe more questionable venue for. For the. The more edge case things.
00:21:59.702 - 00:22:12.862, Speaker B: That's a good point and completely agree with you. I'm gonna take us to a. I guess the more relevant and investment discussion where we topic. Even though I would love to invest above that.
00:22:12.966 - 00:22:18.398, Speaker A: God, the revenue is 250 million. Like less than a year. It's crazy.
00:22:18.574 - 00:22:36.800, Speaker B: Ridiculous Base. It is kind of a mini base season. I don't know if you guys are. Danny, I know you must. You should have seen it. Dan Smith has been very focused on data stuff. I don't know if he's still coining, but it's a lot of coins launching on base.
00:22:36.800 - 00:23:15.370, Speaker B: And also they just got Phantom and they got integrated into Phantom. I'm curious. First of all, I want to start off with a very basic question, which is do you think that base feels natural? Like, do you think it's astroturfed or do you think like the ecosystem feels like a regular blockchain ecosystem? To me, it feels fake. That's why, like, Solana very much feels like when you log on to ct, that's like, I feel like representative of Solana. Solana is representative of ct. But base is like their most popular meme. Coin is named dgen an Anon.
00:23:15.370 - 00:23:21.226, Speaker B: It's like what people imagine crypto people like to say, you know, so that's my.
00:23:21.298 - 00:23:36.634, Speaker A: Yeah, they're not killing chickens on live streams. That shit's so fake. I mean. Yeah, it's coming from a corporate entity as well. And it wasn't that long ago that the. I think it was like a malady the maladies or derivatives thereof got like all banned from. Yeah.
00:23:36.634 - 00:23:53.060, Speaker A: And you know, I don't know exactly the details of that, but it was like you ran into the corporate office and instigated shit and then got all. All got banned and then we're upset about it. Like it's, it's coinbase. This is what you should expect. So to some regard it's like, all right, I don't know, it just is what it is.
00:23:54.000 - 00:24:06.536, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. But they, they had something to do with the blob fees and that's what I wanted to bring up today. And Dan Smith, I think you can explain it much better than I could ever even attempt to.
00:24:06.688 - 00:24:50.422, Speaker A: Yeah, can you add my screen in here and I'll go ahead and share screen and kind of walk through some of the data on this so basis seen an immense rise in activ over the last three to four months. Now they're doing basically the third highest rev of any blockchain behind Ethereum and Solana. And it's really driven by priority fees. So you have people. Again, going back to our first conversation, priority fees are the mechanism of on base to outbid other users for priority access to state. Now what's driving that has been pretty much meme coin activity. So if we look at like this is the last 24 hours, but the top 10 contracts here, you know, we have Banana Gun, Uniswap and two Uni swap routers.
00:24:50.422 - 00:25:24.366, Speaker A: Banana gun. And then we have these unknown bot contracts, seven of them which are, you know, these are just trading bots, mev bots that are looking to grab opportunities in the top 10 based on gas consumption. So you know, to me this is, this looks a lot like the activity you see on Solana. You know, base has been cranking its gas limit higher and higher. So we talk about the weekly view here on the right. You can see the, the uptake in gas throughput. So you're just measuring the amount of gas or computational resources that the chain is processing, measured in gas per second.
00:25:24.366 - 00:26:01.640, Speaker A: The unit itself isn't that relevant, but you can see the clear up in the to the right trend here. Same thing with transactions per second. This is just another way of measuring again that same type of measure when you're looking for the amount of computation or transactional processing that the chain is doing. So you can see it's total gas and transaction count up into the right. So you've seen this huge rise in on chain activity. And again most of which has been driven by meme coins and Just trading activity in general. Again, zooming back out to a lot of this got attributed to being like a Solana problem when it's really just an industry problem, if you even want to call it a problem based on the last conversation we just had.
00:26:01.640 - 00:26:43.860, Speaker A: But meme coins are the primary driver of activity in the blockchain industry today. Again, I, I don't personally want that to be where we end up, but that's a fact of the matter of where we are today. Now, a pretty interesting thing that we've seen over the last two days specifically is a sharp rise in the number of reverted transaction. Again, going back to comparing and contrasting between Solana and Base. It wasn't that long ago and there was this huge narrative around poor transaction quality on Solana driven by these reverted transactions or know people like to call them failed transactions. Personally I think there's like failed transactions are the larger umbrella and within that you have like subsets of what actually happened, which is like reverted transactions and dropped transactions. Solana's problem was on the ladder.
00:26:43.860 - 00:27:26.924, Speaker A: Drop transactions are a much worse problem to have as well. Whereas reverts really aren't a problem at all. It's just generally bot activity that doesn't care if it transaction reverts because if it reverts 10 times and it wins once, the view is that that will be that one profit. The the profit generated on the one transaction execution will outweigh that of the nine previous reverts. So Jacob Sharples from our team at Blockworks Research on the data side, put together a quick little analysis, just kind of like highlighting what exactly was happening with this sharp uptick in transaction reverts. And interestingly, there's about four transactions that appear to be like token snipers where they're just trying to be the first person to buy a new token launch. We're actually driving the sharp uptick.
00:27:26.924 - 00:28:05.958, Speaker A: So I toggled back to the daily view on our dashboard, which is available at optimism.blockworksresearch.com to anybody and everybody willing to access it. And again, looking back at these same two charts, our gas throughput and our transaction throughput, you know, we see this uptick in the red line here, which is our reverted transaction share. So the gray is going to be your total and then the green and the red are successful in the reverted, which will sum to the total. So we saw this like massive uptick in top line transactions per second. But interestingly about 45 of the 100 transactions per second are related to reverted transactions. So again, these are the sniper bots saying, I'm just trying to be the first person to buy it.
00:28:05.958 - 00:28:38.578, Speaker A: If I'm not going to be the first person, don't buy it at all. And again, most of these transactions end up failing. And now you see it's basically been like this 20 or so percent reduction in available block space to people that are just trying to process transactions. So the negative externality that's created from this is users paying higher transaction fees because these bots are spamming. And base's transaction fee mechanism has a global fee called the base fee. When that rises, everybody has to pay a higher fee to get in the block. And I think that's the big risk that you really don't want these reverted transactions to lead to.
00:28:38.714 - 00:29:12.930, Speaker B: Perfect. Because what I want to ask to you, Daniel, is on the data side. You guys have spent a lot of time looking into Base and also looking into other L2s. And like, from my point of view, it's very clear to me that Bass is getting a kind of a lead Amongst the other L2s. Especially, like, for as long as I can remember, it's been Arbitrum and then everybody else, and now it feels like it's Base and then Arbitrum and then everybody else. Is this something that you're also seeing on the data side, or is there anything you think that like, particularly caused this?
00:29:13.100 - 00:29:45.700, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So we track all the major L2s, but we don't track all of the L2s. There's just too many. And, you know, with all due respect, you can track three or four of them and you're going to get 90 plus percent of activity. So I like to use Grow the Pie for when I'm trying to look at, like, all right, you know, I want the 95th L2. Like, I'm curious how when you stack the data in there, all the way down the stack, what does this actually look like? And Grow the Pie does an excellent job of this. So interestingly, if you do that for transaction fees, which for the sake of every L2 is basically your top line number, that's your rev.
00:29:45.700 - 00:30:11.780, Speaker A: BASE is climbing consistently up and to the right on its share of total transaction fees across all L2s. Now it's up towards about 60%. So about 60% of all fee paying activity is happening on Base. I agree with you. That felt like it used to be Arbitrum and now it's kind of like shifted to Base. I think there's a couple reasons for that. Probably the easiest one to point to and feel confident in is just Coinbase's distribution.
00:30:11.780 - 00:30:33.360, Speaker A: It was never a doubt that they were going to point the cannon at base. And I think you're starting to see that whether it's just the stablecoins they're parking there or the effort they're putting into bringing developers on chain, which is definitely the right thing to do if you're trying to grow a blockchain ecosystem. I think they've been crushing it and I think you're now just starting to see kind of like the repercussions of that.
00:30:33.480 - 00:30:34.736, Speaker B: Danny, what do you think?
00:30:34.888 - 00:31:25.918, Speaker C: Yeah, the other clear one, which I mean you discussed in the data previously, but I mean they've been growing their throughput as well. So I think if they're able to kind of continue to funnel new users onto the chain, which Coinbase as a brand like you would expect, like you just mentioned, that they'd be, they'd continue to be able to do that. If that's by enabling like additional integrations into like the Wallet or the Exchange etc, that, that they can then, you know, leverage Base itself for the products built on there, I think they have opportunities to kind of continue to do, to do that. So I mean, it makes sense that as they've kind of scaled throughput on the chain itself, like more gas, more tps as possible, that we'd also just see growth of like market share in terms of fees generated and overall amount of amount, amount of activity just based on those funnels they have.
00:31:26.054 - 00:31:43.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I agreed there. And I think Boccaccio, one of the other things you. Excuse me, Daniel. Boccaccio, one of the other things you mentioned here was the impact this is having on Ethereum. So Ethereum just closed its highest day ever in total blob fees. I need to fact check that. But definitely the highest day in the last three months.
00:31:43.130 - 00:32:14.414, Speaker A: And this is really like Base is playing a pretty significant role of the share of blobs being purchased. So it's about 33, let's call it a third percent of all blobs are being purchased by Base. And that's just a testament to the amount of activity that's happening on that chain right now. Again driven by Meme coins as well. But this is not atypical. This is really what you'd expect to see of a growing ecosystem in the industry today. And I think this has some interesting backdrops onto the blob landscape.
00:32:14.414 - 00:32:38.630, Speaker A: One, it's starting to drive more value back to Ethereum. Two, if you like, plot this against Total RAV like now you can actually see the blob fees. So that's a pretty big upgrade. It's still, you know, 5ish percent of total RAV, but it's there nonetheless. I think that's just, you know, marching in the right direction from that perspective. It hasn't really, you know, you can still get fairly cheap transactions on L2s, which is great to see. I think that's working quite nicely.
00:32:38.630 - 00:33:05.076, Speaker A: The other thing I'm thinking about is, you know, I think in Petra A, which is coming in Q1, that will be to. There'll be a couple of changes there. So potentially more blobs, potentially shorter block times. So you're doing two things to increase the supply of blobs. That kind of hits a reset on the market. I think then we'll have to scale back up to the new limit. And it's a pretty good way to kind of grow the ecosystem without any breaking changes.
00:33:05.076 - 00:33:23.090, Speaker A: Right. You can hit the ceiling, add more capacity. Hit the ceiling, add more capacity. I think that's like a no brainer way to do it. We're seeing Solana do the basically the exact same thing in Agave 2.1. That's like Anza's client Onza spun out of the Solana Labs team. That's when they want to start allegedly increasing the block space.
00:33:23.090 - 00:33:46.798, Speaker A: You know, it's very challenging to get a good read on these things. Basically just like reading the tea leaves of core dev tweets. But sounds like in 2.1 that's when the, the release when they want to start actually increasing CU limits. CUs are just Solana versions of Solana's version of gas. So again the incremental increases here I think make a ton of sense. It's just like this weird push and pull for Ethereum right now where they've hit this limit, they're making money off this.
00:33:46.798 - 00:34:13.670, Speaker A: It's driving fees back to the L1 and ultimately the token. But you know, this impending capacity increase is coming and DA inherently generates no value off priority access to state. When we were looking at that last chart I had from our Optimism dashboard, again available at optimism.blockworksresearch.com covering all the super chain. You saw the share of transaction fees that come from priority access to state. Priority fees. Right.
00:34:13.670 - 00:35:04.246, Speaker A: I think my favorite chart on there, which honestly I might try to show this again here quickly, is just looking at the amount of fees generated by transaction fees in the first like X number of slots. So you think of a block, it's filled with transactions and then in that, think of like a block, it's filled with transactions, and then in that they're all ranked, you know, the first transaction to the last transaction. So on this chart on the left here, you can see the share of the total L2 fees paid between the base fee and the priority fee based on where in the block slot you are. So the first transaction in the block play is 99% of the fee is priority fees. Right, because you're outbidding to be there first. And op stack blocks are priority ranked or priority sorted, so whoever pays the most goes first. And so you can see that people are bidding to be first in the block.
00:35:04.246 - 00:35:55.420, Speaker A: And then on the chart on the right you can say, all right, the first. If you take the priority fees paid in only the first transaction of every block, what percentage of that of total transaction fees does that make up? So the first slot alone is about 40% of total transaction fees. And then the first 10 slots are about half. This ranges from about half to, you know, as high we've seen as about 80%. I think this has trended lower over the last month or two given the increased activity pushing up not only L2 base fee, again, that's more of that congestion scaling fee, but also the L1 transaction fee because blobs now cost money. So yeah, I think that's just kind of an interesting way to kind of visualize how priority fees, again, this idea of paying to be first in line to access a piece of state is actually impacting blockchain profitability which flows back to the chain or the token holder, depending on the setup.
00:35:56.040 - 00:36:30.540, Speaker B: That's fair. I'm gonna kind of tie this into what we were talking about, which is like, is Meme Coin activity sustainable? And I think for Solana it doesn't have to be sustainable because Solana now has a decent ecosystem. Like, it has Camino, it has Jupiter, it has jito, it has like all the perp stuff. I do worry a bit about base because I feel like it doesn't have that many apps. It doesn't have that like base layer of apps that Solana has. And we know Ethereum has to the point that like activity is going up. Blobs are actually worth something now because activity is going up.
00:36:30.540 - 00:37:06.014, Speaker B: But okay, let's say Meme Coin craze slows down a little bit, which is not like unrealistic to think about. And Danny, like, I also kind of want to ask about you about this as well. Like, how do you see? Because to me it's like Aerodrome is the big one on base. They have a few AI agent stuff. Social fire has just been like kind of a disappointment. It might come back, but I don't even know how much like how many transactions that really requires on that end. So curious what you think or if.
00:37:06.022 - 00:37:13.570, Speaker C: You think it's in terms of sustainability for base. Like in a minute, coin cool offs.
00:37:14.160 - 00:37:26.664, Speaker B: Yeah. If meme coins were to cool off on like. Because I think Ethereum without meme coins would be fine. It is fine. Nobody does. I mean fine is I guess like a. It's.
00:37:26.664 - 00:37:28.552, Speaker B: I don't want to say fine is.
00:37:28.576 - 00:37:32.820, Speaker A: Actually the perfect word there. Right? Like, yeah, I'm fine. Like you're not.
00:37:35.840 - 00:37:57.910, Speaker B: Solana without meme coins, I think would be okay as well. Like it wouldn't. It wouldn't be where it is, where it's like we, we post rev every morning happening. But it's like it would be at a different. It would be at a different stage, but it would be fine because there would still be relative activity because there are apps on it bases. Not that many apps.
00:37:58.570 - 00:38:39.390, Speaker C: I think there's different ways of maybe framing or taking this question, but there's no base token today that's overvalued on any basis. So in terms of like being fine, like, I guess you don't. There aren't any like base token holders that have to worry about their token being rerated downwards. Maybe if you're a coin stockholder that might be concerned, but I don't think that like base revenues are driving a large portion of that today. Although it might be related. Right? Like retail demand for trading coins on Coinbase. The exchange might be related to the meme point activity that happens on chain, but I think that's kind of like neither here nor there.
00:38:39.390 - 00:39:25.528, Speaker C: I think ultimately like the fact that base as an L2 is, you know, it has this sort of, sort of, kind of corporate entity backing in Coinbase. Like it doesn't really feel like there's a scenario where they're not fine. Just from the perspective of like it's been a. It's been a very profitable like venture. You know, the sequencer and the fees generated on base have surely been like, very good. And it's the, I guess we just described it as like the top L2 today. Sure, if you were to see activity fall off that might adjust your targets for if there's some inevitable base token, but I don't think that really has any doom and gloom scenario for the chain itself.
00:39:25.528 - 00:39:50.480, Speaker C: Just given the kind of the relationship with Coinbase and their ability to continue using it and pushing it and probably supporting and building products on top of it. They see the value of using, you know, a decentralized, well at some point, a decentralized, potentially chain and you know, building products up and around that. And so I think unless that vision from them changes, then yeah, they will be fine.
00:39:51.060 - 00:40:09.414, Speaker B: I'm just wondering if, if Base is in the lead not because it's like better than the other L2s, but because all the other L2s are just worse than it is. And that's my like, you know what I'm trying to say? Like, I don't know. What do you think, Daniel?
00:40:09.542 - 00:40:43.132, Speaker A: I, I think the question's pretty interesting and I think a lot of this comes down to like life cycle. You know, I'll like overgeneralize and say there's like the venture stage, seed stage and then there's like the growth stage. I think Solana has now entered the growth stage where you know, like the, an apdosis we. One of these younger chains is very much in that seed stage and Base is sort of like in the seed stage, flirting with the growth stage. So I just think it's like a different point of its life cycle. Right. Like Solana launched for over four, almost five years ago now.
00:40:43.132 - 00:41:10.570, Speaker A: I think five years in March. And yeah, there's that last major unlock in March. So there you go. Whereas BASE is like a year and change, let's call it old. So yeah, it's just in a good different spot in its development cycle. I think it'll like catch up. Well, provably it has or you know, it's already surpassed every other L2 and I think it'll like play that like L1 sized game here pretty soon again I think that's just, it's attached to Coinbase and has a superpower nobody else has.
00:41:10.570 - 00:41:54.888, Speaker A: So I think that's pretty interesting as well. But yeah, I just think of this more as in life cycles. Like I saw a tweet the other day, I can't remember who was by, but something did like the TLDR was they were comparing the like dollar of like transaction fees per, you know, dollar of issuance and it was about like Aptos. And then they compared it to like a Solana and Ethereum, which to me is just like, yeah, no shit, a startup is losing money. Like duh. But like I don't, I didn't really agree with the framework at all because you know, not the entire issuance amount is a cost from the perspective of a token holder. If you're a token holder, you are literally being paid it.
00:41:54.888 - 00:42:21.740, Speaker A: The cost is the part you don't get which is the commission and that validators take out of the issuance. So like that's really the cost and you know, I would have used that number. But regardless, you'd still end up in directionally the same spot where yeah, duh, Aptos doesn't have a ton of activity yet. So that's kind of like my framing on just largely. I think we try to look at everything as in the same point of its life cycle when that's just inherently not true.
00:42:22.960 - 00:42:55.300, Speaker C: I do think maybe Bach, relative to your comment about comparing it to other L2s, like an arbitrom, for example, I would maybe be more worried about base if they weren't like if the strategy here wasn't to rapidly scale the throughput of the chain today. Right. If they were just sitting around like, oh, this is fine, 10 tps, it's great. Like this is going to be the future of finance. While Arbitrum has like orbit chains, etc. I think if they weren't going after this, like, I think. I mean I think they have fairly ambitious targets, right.
00:42:55.300 - 00:43:27.206, Speaker C: Like wanting to get to like a gig of gas a second or whatever. The number is like thousand tps, etc. I don't know what the kind of like probably shifting targets are as you move into the future further, but I think we're seeing that that is scaling and leading to greater demand and activity for block space. Like block space on their chain relative to the Arbitrum chain itself. For example, I would say feels like has been relatively stagnant for the past, if you want to call it six to 12 months.
00:43:27.358 - 00:43:48.298, Speaker B: Well, they've had a few incentive programs, not particularly stagnant, but yeah, they've. It's a tough one, I think. I don't know. This is like. I'm gonna go back to this argument that I once made to Daniel Smith and he called me a. But I don't think L2s are that good at scaling. I just.
00:43:48.298 - 00:44:01.392, Speaker B: No at that good at execution because it's like 40 TPS and you get whatever TPS. What TPS do you get on Eve? It's like 20s sub 2013 or 14 or something, right?
00:44:01.576 - 00:44:06.780, Speaker A: Yeah. And like Bass is far again far in the. Far and away in the lead here at about 100.
00:44:07.080 - 00:44:35.160, Speaker B: Yeah. So base is now okay, but the rest just aren't. They're not like that good at execution. They don't have. I mean, I guess it's a little bit cheaper, but at the cost of, like, you have higher slippage on everything you do and you don't have that many assets to trade and there isn't that much capital on the chain. I don't like the L3 strategies that all of them have had. Not all of them, but Arbitrum and ZK Sync.
00:44:35.160 - 00:45:03.574, Speaker B: I like base. I think they're actually doing something right. And even though it feels a bit like the Fed chain because they. They launched their tokens as dgen is their meme coin, I do think that, like, if they can just get a couple more apps. The reason I'm talking about apps so much is because we're writing a report on base at the moment and we can't find any perps. Interesting perps per apps, which I feel like was the biggest thing for, like, years and now it's like there's nothing on it.
00:45:03.662 - 00:45:07.078, Speaker A: Yeah, it's almost harder to not find per protocols interesting.
00:45:07.174 - 00:45:27.952, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, that's literally it. And I was like, wow, maybe this because to me, like, in my mind, it's like L2, okay, base is the relevant one, but we can't even find like a basic primitive on it. It kind of puts you in a whirlwind where you're like, okay, but you have the same experience on SUI and Aptos and all the other L1s as.
00:45:27.976 - 00:45:54.602, Speaker A: Well, where you're like, again, going back to that, like, life cycle thing. Right? Like, you just have to grow into those. It's a. You have to. You need a lot of shit to build out. Basic defi primitives, which was honestly one of my, like, strong resistances against the L2 model was you have to just like, replicate this over how many chains for what reason again? But yeah, to your point about, like, being bad at execution. Yeah, it's really interesting to just see base just willing to step on the gas and like, crank this gas limit.
00:45:54.602 - 00:46:36.990, Speaker A: Like, pun intended, crank the gas limit higher while other teams just like, aren't. I just think that's like a very interesting perspective where, you know, I don't have like, the deep enough technical knowledge to know that, like, why you can or can't make this decision. I, you know, you crank the gas limit higher, you risk state growth problems. But like, BNB hit these pretty quickly when they did this last cycle. They only have like 20 validators, but they're still like a distributed validator set nonetheless. So you have different people running different machines, et cetera, versus, like Coinbase taking the very centralized decision of like, hey, we run one sequencer, we're just going to throw hardware at. This is my assumption of what's happening.
00:46:36.990 - 00:46:49.090, Speaker A: But again, like, I don't know why if you're Arbitrum or another one of these like EVM based L2s, you're not just doing the exact same thing. So that's just like one open question that I haven't, I don't have an answer to at the moment.
00:46:49.430 - 00:46:50.970, Speaker B: Daddy, anything to add?
00:46:51.510 - 00:47:47.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, and I, I don't know how much this is playing into it, but I do think like the decision to scale via Like L3s, for example, from Arbitrum, like maybe that trying to explore that particular like product design and offering it to apps or like, you know, would be app app chains, maybe that prevents them in a way from scaling the Arbitrum chain itself as it would, would likely cannibalize some of that activity. It's like, I don't know that you could sit in both of those worlds and say, hey, we're scaling the L2 to a thousand TPS, but also like spin up your L3 and it's like, you know, the cost and the speed is like basically the same thing. So it's like, well, you know, maybe you should just be on the L2 where all the other assets are, you know, I don't, I don't know if there's like that positioning between those two ideas is preventing some of these teams from, from doing the same thing.
00:47:48.580 - 00:48:04.020, Speaker B: Yeah, but, yeah, that makes sense actually. And that would be basically the L1 L2 debacle all over again. We're having fun. We're having fun in crypto. While prices took take like a 10 discount. I'm back to on L2. This is crazy.
00:48:04.020 - 00:48:26.748, Speaker B: I think that's good though. I think we're done for today. Anything else you guys want to urgently bring up to the listeners? No. All right, fantastic. Danny, thanks for coming on. Dan Smith, thanks for making an appearance. Daniel Boccaccio, for listening.
00:48:26.844 - 00:48:27.884, Speaker C: Thanks for hosting.
00:48:28.012 - 00:48:29.804, Speaker A: Always a pleasure. Always a pleasure.
00:48:29.852 - 00:48:30.460, Speaker B: Always a pleasure.
