00:00:00.250 - 00:00:26.230, Speaker A: Bitcoin changes very slowly, and it might be four or five years until any opcodes or roll ups are introduced. So I think Sachs could actually evolve over time, where in the time between now and when the new opcodes come, it starts looking like what's called a sovereign roll up. And one of the big properties of a sovereign roll up is that it has 100% of a reorgan resistance of bitcoin atom.
00:00:27.050 - 00:01:20.882, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research brought to you by the Atom accelerator. If you're a developer looking for a home in this industry, the atom Economic zone welcomes you. You will hear more about the Atom accelerator later on in the show. We are recording this episode on June 20, and we have a great interview coming to you with Munib Ali, the co creator of Stacks, which is a bitcoin focused scaling solution aiming to onboard hundreds of billions of dollars of idle bitcoin into DFI. Before the interview, we are joined today by Ren and Zero X pibbles to discuss what's going on in this industry. But before we even jump into that, I want to do a little new segment alert, kind of hitting some DeFi governance updates, which again, our tool gov hub, makes this super easy. So I'll just do some quick hitters here, and then maybe if we have some thoughts on any of these three different protocols and what they're doing, we can kind of jive on some of their updates.
00:01:20.882 - 00:02:09.330, Speaker B: But real quickly, we got maker Dow, which officially pushed their DSR update that went live yesterday, on Monday the 19th. And so the DSR has jumped to 3.49%. And that basically means that you can earn more die on your die, right? This is basically an interest rate, so you've seen three and a half million deposited into the new SDI contract. And Spark protocol's debt ceiling also jumped from five to $20 million. We did an episode, I believe that was last week, with Sam McPherson, the founder of Spark Protocol, really diving into kind of what the implications of this are. But really, it's just kind of awesome to see that kind of being pushed live in real time. Similarly, with another protocol, Ave, we have go mainnet approaching launch.
00:02:09.330 - 00:02:46.638, Speaker B: So the last piece of the puzzle that we were waiting for before go could really kind of hit the on chain governance boat was Ave companies kind of coming in and posting like, hey, we think this is ready for production, ready to go live. We got that post from Ave companies 14 days ago in the governance forums. So it feels like sufficient time has passed for them to kind of push that to an on chain vote. So it feels like any day now we're expecting to see that kind of push on chain and go will be activated. So super exciting there. And lastly, we have osmosis. There's a ton of things going down with osmosis.
00:02:46.638 - 00:03:28.922, Speaker B: I think it was westy the other day, pinged our analyst chat and was like, all right, what's going on on GovHub? I see four osmosis high priority flags. What is this? We're ready to give David shit for just bragging about being a cosmos, maxi. But sure enough, there's a ton going down over there. So we have an updated inflation schedule change to the community pool allocation in terms of inflation, which is basically reducing the amount of inflation going to the community pool. With more flowing to lps and stakers, supercharged liquidity pools are coming. There's a big discussion around that, as well as a protocol taker fee on swaps. So really trying to start cranking the protocol revenue aspect, which makes sense for an app chain.
00:03:28.922 - 00:03:42.206, Speaker B: So yeah, that's kind of three protocols, three major announcements, kind of all related to deFi governance. Again, really highlighting the importance of DeFi governance because, my goodness, there's a lot going on. So curious if you guys have any takes on any of those developments.
00:03:42.318 - 00:04:27.066, Speaker C: I'll start off with, I think obviously having stable coins generating interest is good, but it'll be some time before it gets adopted throughout the wider ecosystem. I think similar to, for example, liquid staking tokens for ETH, both of those will slowly increase in their percentage of interest bearing versus non interest bearing tokens. And it just makes sense from a capital efficiency perspective. And there's like a lot of protocols that are offering treasury yield, but not exactly in a permissionless manner. And Makerdao is kind of a method to get access to those, quote unquote, treasury yields, and the permission is managed. So definitely a good move from them. And then on Ave, I think it's quite interesting seeing the different levels of hype between curve USD and Aavego.
00:04:27.098 - 00:04:27.294, Speaker A: Right?
00:04:27.332 - 00:04:48.130, Speaker C: Like CurveUSD is getting a lot of mindshare on Twitter, they have that new fancy llama and soft liquidation mechanism, whereas Avego has been relatively quiet. I haven't heard anything about Avego, to be honest. And it's quite surprising coming that at one time it was a very core part of the strategy to increase their product revenue.
00:04:48.210 - 00:05:01.846, Speaker D: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see the implications of Go's launch too, with the DSR. Like, you'd think a move might be to mint go and then swap it to SDI to just collect that three and a half percent at the detriment of the maker.
00:05:01.878 - 00:05:02.550, Speaker B: Dow.
00:05:02.710 - 00:05:23.570, Speaker D: So curious to see how that plays out going forward. And on the osmosis front, a lot of big upgrades. Doesn't really surprise me, given all the heated competition over in the cosmos landscape. You have astroport DyDX is moving over there soon. Obviously astroport's on neutron, so definitely not surprised to see Sonny and the osmosis team kind of ramp things up over there.
00:05:23.640 - 00:05:33.494, Speaker B: Yeah, you actually mentioned a great point on the looping trade, if you will, of using SDI as collateral on an ulterior platform and minting a stablecoin against it.
00:05:33.532 - 00:05:33.734, Speaker A: Right?
00:05:33.772 - 00:06:22.998, Speaker B: So Go is launching with a one and a half percent yield borrow rate, excuse me, and SDI currently has 3.49%, so you can kind of loop that trade and try to capture the spread there, which is pretty interesting to think about. But yeah, I don't know, maybe we can be fun to watch that one as well, especially considering curve is considering the same thing. Right? You can mint CRV USD against. So definitely interesting collateral choice and I think that'll lead. While that's kind of just like leeching onto the yield of rwas through Makerdao, it'll likely through the PSM, arbitrage through the PSM will increase the amount of USDC that Makerdao has to go kind of continue the deployment of capital into these rwas. So it'll be really interesting to watch this one play out.
00:06:22.998 - 00:06:27.590, Speaker B: Maybe we can kick it over to a little hot seat, cool throne, Sam. Maybe I'll start it off with you, my man.
00:06:27.660 - 00:07:20.426, Speaker D: Yeah, I've got a good one, actually. Finally, some good news on the block for the hot seat and cool throne segment. So obviously we saw a pretty big pullback with the SEC suing Coinbase and finance, but we've pretty much completely retraced that move, and in my opinion, it can likely be attributed to the moves coming out of tradfi. So we saw Blackrock file for a bitcoin spot ETF after shortly seeing rumors that happened like 12 hours later last week on Thursday or Friday, I believe it was. And then we also see rumors floating around that fidelity is looking to file a spot ETF as well, and AP underscore abacus on Twitter. So take this with a grain of salt, because he's tweeted some false rumors before, but he did say that fidelity was potentially looking to convert the grayscale bitcoin trust into an ETF and that maybe they'd put a bid in there. So that's definitely something to watch going forward.
00:07:20.426 - 00:07:51.082, Speaker D: And then we also saw Citadel Fidelity and Charles Schwab finally launched the eDX exchange that was talked about about nine months ago. So that's launching later today. It's actually pretty interesting. It's not a custodial exchange. It's literally just designed to facilitate trades between fiat and four digital assets. So ETH, litecoin, bitcoin, and bitcoin cash. So it's likely that a lot of retail brokerages will route trades through EDX in order to provide exposure in a brokerage account to digital assets.
00:07:51.082 - 00:08:04.982, Speaker D: So I think that's honestly two really bullish news points, and I don't think they should be overlooked. I know we get all kinds of hype news that ends up being a nothing burger, but these two actually feel like they have some legs. So I'll be watching them closely going forward into the rest of this year.
00:08:05.036 - 00:08:22.122, Speaker E: Yeah, it's super interesting seeing all this positive news for bitcoin. If you look in the market right now, you can actually see bitcoin dominance is edging over 50% for the first time in quite a while. So it's kind of like return to fundamentals.
00:08:22.266 - 00:09:02.730, Speaker C: I think overall, it's looking like a good direction for Chatfi. A few nice things to know for the BlackRock spot ETF. They'll be partnering with Coinbase custody. They'll also be partnering with Nasdaq. There's a specific segment in filing that says specifically how they're going to alleviate sort of the market manipulation concerns that have traditionally been SEc's argument against a spot bitcoin ETF. And also there's a fun tidbit of information I saw on Twitter that BlackRock has a successful ETF outlook history of 575 to one. So the statistics and probability are looking pretty good.
00:09:02.730 - 00:09:25.582, Speaker C: And another thing for the fidelity and Charles Schwab, I don't know how much access their users get to crypto today, but in between both of them, they have around $11 trillion worth of assets on their platform, which is a lot. That's like five x the crypto market cap today. And so there's potential for inflows there, especially if retail wants to trade.
00:09:25.646 - 00:10:15.326, Speaker D: As a caveat, too, on that point, Ren, I think the one ETF that BlackRock didn't get approved was an ETF that basically they wouldn't have to report on what was being held in the ETF for a long period of time. So that makes sense that that wouldn't actually get approved. Obviously, investors deserve to know what they're buying. So that's just another interesting caveat. And then I also find it kind of funny that the US is just continually siding with bitcoiners when in all reality bitcoiners are like the most anti establishment segment within crypto. They're like, yeah, you guys are fine, let's push through a bitcoin spot ETF potentially, and do all these things and allow bitcoin trading and all these different venues and all these other things are bad. But really it's bitcoiners who are no, like, government controlled money is bad.
00:10:15.326 - 00:10:23.810, Speaker D: We should go against the nation state. So it's just kind of ironic that the US is ultimately siding with the bitcoiners. But Dan, what do you got on the hot seater cool throne this week?
00:10:23.880 - 00:11:01.166, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that one, Sam, but I got the op sac on the cool throne this week. Been a lot of development going on over there, without a doubt. And they recently pushed the bedrock upgrade, which had about 50% to 60% savings in terms of gas costs for users when compared to the legacy system. And it also pushed a discrete two second block time. So seen a lot of interesting traction going on over there. And as a user of optimism, I personally have noticed a much better experience. I used to complain about the quality of the execution over there, and I've honestly been super happy with kind of how bedrock has changed that.
00:11:01.166 - 00:11:54.174, Speaker B: So love to see that. And then more interestingly, we just saw Binance announced op BNB, which is their scaling solution based on a fork of the this is. I put them in the cool throne just because this is definitely like a nod towards the quality of the op stack. When people come in and say, you have open source code, I love what you're doing, I'm going to fork it and use it. And it's really interesting to see binance kind of choose that architecture of the other existing architectures, and they're taking a very interesting stance as well by leaning very heavily into the gaming industry. It seems like that's kind of the wave that they're trying to attract, which is interesting because personally I want crypto gaming to work so badly. Just as a gamer at heart and obviously passionate about crypto, I'd love for the two to be fused together.
00:11:54.174 - 00:13:04.578, Speaker B: And I just yearn for the idea of an on chain runescape, but we'll get back to that another day. And they even included things on their post, like mentioning how OPBMB will be tailored to the specific needs of gaming workloads optimized for fast transaction finality and support gaming focused features or customizations. So really making a point there. And also another interesting thing they did was really crank up the gas limit from 30 million, which is what the op stack on ethereum currently uses, to about 100 million. So they're really cranking that thing to the max, which is similar to what they did with BNB consensus itself. My interesting thought is like, okay, will this be compatible with the super chain on Ethereum? I actually don't know the answer to this, so I don't know if any of you guys do, and I'd love to hear it, but it is based on the same tech, but I don't know if that means it can natively be compatible. So the question, I guess here is optimism pushed out this great open source tech and somebody came along and forked it, that being binance, and now they're using it at their own benefit with really no reward.
00:13:04.578 - 00:13:23.358, Speaker B: Going back to optimism for producing that great tech. And sure, it's a nod at the credence, and it will help bolster the strength of the technology with somebody else using it and pushing it to its limits, but there's no direct compensation for optimism. So it's kind of curious and interesting to kind of see those dynamics play out in real time.
00:13:23.444 - 00:13:52.038, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd probably say the more chains that end up using the op stack and building over there, the better. Even before an interoperability standard is actually established, the more activity that's over there, the better. And I think eventually they'll figure out the interoperability problem. I know a lot of other teams are working on solving that for that ecosystem as well. So I think it's ultimately bullish op, who knows if it actually results in anything directly for the DAO, but I think just the more users, more activity, et cetera, are using roll ups on Ethereum, the better.
00:13:52.124 - 00:14:02.902, Speaker B: This still settles down to finance chain, so it's not using Ethereum as the settlement, like it's truly a fork and then an l two sitting on top of BMB.
00:14:03.046 - 00:14:09.740, Speaker D: Okay, that I did not realize. Yeah, okay, I don't really know about that. Then take back my take on that.
00:14:10.290 - 00:14:38.420, Speaker B: It's interesting because they've kind of long not copied, but been inspired by some would probably argue copied the ideals going on over in the Ethereum community. So now it's no surprise that they have the need and desire for scaling solutions as well. Which is yeah, why I'm just really interested that they chose the op stack. I would love to kind of peel back more layers with that team and see what led to those.
00:14:40.070 - 00:15:38.294, Speaker C: I mean, BNV chain is as centralized of a blockchain as it gets. They run on a proof authority, have like a super small battery data set, which I would guess is mostly run by binance themselves. And so it's interesting that they're choosing the op stack as a scaling solution when they probably could tune that blockchain however they wanted to and just scale it's more so a centralized database than a decentralized blockchain. I think one of the interesting thing is that a lot of these protocols that you're seeing launching their own app chains, right? Avo is the first they're using the op stack. One's an outlier, two is a trend, a third one, and maybe you start getting a semblance of network effects. And even though none of that value accrual goes back to the op token itself, that network effect is still valuable. Network effect is a lot of the time how something gets value accrual in sort of like the token sense.
00:15:38.294 - 00:15:46.550, Speaker C: And so even if none of that value accrues directly to the token, I feel like that does definitely add to the valuation of the token or how people evaluate that token.
00:15:46.630 - 00:16:14.210, Speaker B: Pure speculation here. But what if all of the activity from BNB chain, which is quite a bit, admittedly in a couple of different categories, from Dex activity to stablecoin activity to just daily active addresses in general, which of course is a questionable metric, but what if all of that activity shifted onto the BNB, the roll up, and then that roll up was able to successfully migrate to using Ethereum? There we go. There's your conspiracy of the day.
00:16:14.280 - 00:16:32.922, Speaker D: That's an interesting one. And it also kind of reminds me of polygon. Honestly, they kind of just copied the cosmos SDK and wound up turning it into a really successful thing. They got lucky with timing, with ETH fees getting so expensive in 2020, 2021, but nonetheless, there's some similar parallels to draw from it, for sure.
00:16:32.976 - 00:17:02.050, Speaker E: Yeah, that's super interesting. And then like to point out for optimism, we also have a 16 z, who's going to launch a roll up with op Stack? You've got Worldcoin, who's going to launch roll up with op stack, and you have base. So bullish optimism, like not necessarily the asset, but I think optimism is poised a lot better for adoption than arbitram is. And optimism also is prettier as far as their branding goes.
00:17:02.120 - 00:17:06.246, Speaker B: Those are the metrics that move the needle. Pimples who you got in the hot seater? Cool throne this week?
00:17:06.348 - 00:17:06.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:06.652 - 00:17:55.300, Speaker E: So I have my favorite protocol. Good old fracs. Oroboro's capital popped up in the governance forums, and he's trying to modify FIP 77, which was a proposal that passed in, like, q three of last year, which authorized a $20 million buyback of frat shares tokens because they said it was undervalued. And it was also for just, like, general price protection. I think they've used maybe, like, 25, 30% of this so far since November. And Auroboros came in, and it's funny because he was bullposting FXS a ton, and he started buying it above $6.
00:17:55.990 - 00:17:56.982, Speaker A: A couple of weeks ago.
00:17:57.036 - 00:18:57.240, Speaker E: And you see that happen, and then you see him come in the forum, and he's like, hey, we need more aggressive buybacks, because he's trying. So, in the past, the buybacks have been. They're all done through frac swap, which uses a t one. And they've usually been executed over, like, three to six months. And Auroboros came in, and he's like, we need to execute these over 30 days. So anytime he wants a couple of million to be deployed, if FXS hits $5 over 30 days, and same if it hits, like, $4, and then likewise, those buybacks would get halted as the price recovers. So everyone's just kind of, like, arguing in the forums, as usual, about what the exact parameters should be and whether buybacks are the right thing to do right now when they should be focusing on getting their collateral ratio up to 100%, because right now, it's like 94.5%.
00:18:57.240 - 00:19:03.660, Speaker E: So, yeah, that's my hot seat. It's been super fun watching all the discourse go down.
00:19:04.350 - 00:19:54.970, Speaker B: You know what they say? Fill, then chill, baby. Now, it is kind of interesting that you can just label that active investing, right? Go buy a bag, and then hit the forums to request more aggressive buybacks. I don't know. Definitely seems a bit suspect, but I think the FraCs team is well aware of the short sightedness of somebody who's actively trading. I did see him kind of crowdsourcing the ideas, and a lot of them had to do with looking for an asset that has been hammered on perps so that leverage can return when markets heat back up. So definitely just a short term trade trying to be executed, which, I don't know, to no one's fault of their own. I suppose.
00:19:56.110 - 00:20:30.086, Speaker E: You always see people. If you see people talking about fxs on Twitter, they're never talking about how great it is. It's always like this heated. You have to defend yourself if you like FXS, and you have to defend yourself because of the price action of it never actually continuing to go up. So these buybacks over time have kind of just been, I guess, exoliquidity for early investors or people who locked up for like two to four years, and they're just on their way out.
00:20:30.188 - 00:20:36.386, Speaker B: Should we be putting effort capital on the hot seat for his take on fracs being the next sushi?
00:20:36.498 - 00:20:52.430, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. They're making ten to 20 x the revenue that anything in the cosmos ecosystem is. So when osmosis makes more than $300 an MEV in a month, then we can actually have a discussion.
00:20:52.930 - 00:21:12.494, Speaker D: I follow this osmosis bot, like a MeV bot on Twitter that automatically reports the Daily MeV. And yeah, it's always like $250 or something like that. So I think that's a pretty fair take. Bibbles. Unfortunately, effort is not here to defend himself, though. So we'll kick it over to Ren for his hot seat or cool throne.
00:21:12.542 - 00:21:54.560, Speaker C: All right, this week I got Bitdao in the hot seat as part of a sort of rebranding initiative from Bitdao, they're going to be converting the bit token to mantle. So for those that don't know, Manto is going to be sort of this new QL two solution that Bitdao is building out. And so as part of that rebranding, they're going to be doing a token conversion process. For every bit token you have, you would get one mantle. But here's where it gets interesting. As part of BIP 21, the community voted to accelerate all of BIP 20 contributions and biddow launch vesting schedules. So that basically means all of the supply becomes circulating in one day whenever that token conversion happens.
00:21:54.560 - 00:22:19.426, Speaker C: As a point of reference, the market cap of bit is 752,000,000. The FDB is 4 billion. So that's a lot of uncirculating supply. But it's important to note that basically, all of that 3.2 billion that's not circulating is held in the Bitdao treasury today. Bitdao has one of the largest treasuries in all of crypto. Just looking at deep Dow today, they have 3.2
00:22:19.426 - 00:23:00.262, Speaker C: billion, and a large majority of that is in the bit token. And it's only sort of beaten by arbitrary, which has a treasury of 3.6 billion. But there's like a bunch of stuff in the governance snapshots that isn't that confidence inspiring. For example, the mantle core contributor team shall be authorized to determine the optimal timing and sequence for the delisting of bit tokens. Listing of MNT tokens, opening of conversion channels, and the mantle network. Mainet feels like there's probably some investors or perhaps buybit in there that are sort of smuggled in to get their vesting accelerated too.
00:23:00.262 - 00:23:39.438, Speaker C: And another thing is that previously the Bitdao approved sort of like a different contribution schedule from Bybit. So they used to have a dynamic trading volume contribution schedule to Bitdao, but now it's modified to a fixed schedule. So it feels like there's some shenanigans here. But I can also buy the take that they want to rebrand away from being associated with Buybit, the bit token. They want to sort of align themselves and their growth with the l two mantle and open up a lot more of the token for sort of like growth initiatives. So I think you can see both sides of the argument.
00:23:39.534 - 00:23:49.734, Speaker E: Yeah, and this is something buybit always whenever regulatory action comes down or like fud comes in heavy, people are always like, buybit's next.
00:23:49.772 - 00:23:50.850, Speaker B: Like, look at Buybit.
00:23:50.930 - 00:24:21.710, Speaker E: Are your buybit withdrawals working? And it's like, yeah, even with that massive buyback they did in December, January, people were like, this is just exit liquidity for all the people who have bit tokens. But these dudes are generally pretty positive sum players. I don't really worry about them at all, like doing anything crazy because they always just make sure that they have all their bases covered. So go for it. Have a crazy valuation with your brand new token ticker and sell some, but they're not going to nuke it to zero.
00:24:21.860 - 00:24:48.582, Speaker D: Yeah, I tend to agree with that. Take pibbles. They do own, I think like 60% of the bit supply. So now MNT, the mantle conversion, which is a bit concerning. But they also do have a treasury that's like, it's definitely the biggest in crypto, I'm pretty sure. I mean, it's got like 300 million of stables and 500 million of eth outside of the native token balance. And I also like the move to actually provide a product for the token to stand for and for people to rally behind.
00:24:48.582 - 00:25:12.186, Speaker D: Because at this point, what are you even buying when you buy bit? You're just kind of confused. It's like, okay, so I have ownership in this dow that's kind of controlled by buybit, but there's massive treasury inflows at fixed intervals. So it's kind of bullish, but there's no product so I don't know. I like the conversion. I'm just not sure on the accelerated vesting schedule. That's a bit fishy to me. All right, well, I feel like that's a pretty good time to kick it over to the interview.
00:25:12.186 - 00:25:15.822, Speaker D: But before we do that, as always, Dan, you want to tell people what's good with the atom accelerator?
00:25:15.886 - 00:26:03.626, Speaker B: The atom economic zone is really becoming a place for developers to build. It's an increasingly attractive environment for a number of different reasons, largely driven by the idea of replicated security, simplifying the effort it takes to really spin up an app chain and be a part of this ecosystem. And we really have the idea of atom becoming money becoming the forefront of discussion. And the power of IBC giving you the flexibility of interoperability, there's an increasing probability. I feel like that with each passing day, IBC will likely become the interop standard for all of crypto. I think effort capital, we kind of shoot on him earlier, but I think he's pretty on par with that one. Neutron now has over $14 million of TVL, which is largely driven by astroport.
00:26:03.626 - 00:26:45.594, Speaker B: And interestingly enough, astroport. Over half of their TVL has kind of migrated to neutron. So we're already seeing some early signs of popularity kind of kicking off over there. And the liquid staking narrative is only getting stronger, especially with stride really pioneering what liquid staking means for all of the cosmos ecosystem. Native USDC is surely coming soon via noble, which would be a huge unlock to have that one trusted source of value when it comes to stable coins. And there's always a debate between centralized and decentralized stables, of course. But native USDC is often heralded for its ability to remain pegged to $1.
00:26:45.594 - 00:27:30.646, Speaker B: And it's kind of a necessity in some regard to have that native form of stability within a DFI ecosystem. And so if you think that you have some value to add to the cosmos ecosystem specifically related to the atom economic zone, the atom accelerator is looking to fund you with a grant ranging from $10,000 to $1 million on a rolling monthly basis. So we'll put their link in the show notes. And please do be sure to check out that website. Now onto the interview with Munib Ali, the co creator of stacks. All right, everyone, we are joined today by Munib Ali, the co creator of stacks, which is a bitcoin focused scaling solution looking to make bitcoin a more productive asset. Thanks a lot for joining us today, Munib.
00:27:30.646 - 00:27:47.374, Speaker B: We're super excited for this conversation and I think it's a great starting point to just kind of break down what stacks is and what's like the primary problem that it's working to solve. So the platform has been live for two years now, and I'd love to get your take to exactly that question. What exactly are you building stacks to solve?
00:27:47.422 - 00:28:32.414, Speaker A: I think the most simple way to think about this is it's a bitcoin l two, both for scalability, but more importantly for new functionality, because we don't have fully expressive smart contracts at bitcoin l one like Ethereum does, or salana or other chains do. And I think bitcoin to me is a settlement layer. And most of the actual use of bitcoin would actually happen in l two s, like lightning for payments or stacks for more advanced smart contracts. So basically, imagine the kind of things that people are doing on Ethereum today, like using stable coins or decentralized exchanges or liquidity pools. All of that can happen with BTC in bitcoin l two s. And that's really what stacks is trying to enable. Awesome.
00:28:32.452 - 00:28:49.686, Speaker B: And when I think about bitcoin as like the l one that feeds l two s, the first thing that comes to my mind are the ten minute block times. How does that factor into kind of the design decisions you're forced to make and what are really the implications of that versus using Ethereum as the example where you have a twelve second block block time.
00:28:49.868 - 00:29:51.526, Speaker A: Yeah, so that was one of the first, the biggest kind of feedback from developers that we have been getting. And first of all, I think stacks is a very sort of like decentralized ecosystem, which is kind of like interesting that a lot of projects sort of say that it's a decentralized ecosystem, but behind the scenes they're typically like one big company that is doing a bulk of the development. And stacks is so decentralized that it actually confuses a lot of people in the industry when folks from different companies are sort of like trying to work on it and they're like, who are you? Why are you working on stacks? So just a little bit of a background there that the main net launched in early 2021, and one of the biggest feedback items very quickly after the main net launch was the bitcoin ten minute block times. Because I don't think it's just a ten minute block time. It could sometimes be 30 minutes or 60 minutes. So it's also unreliable. So you don't know how long you're waiting.
00:29:51.526 - 00:30:45.306, Speaker A: And I think that is problematic. What the stack ecosystem is now doing. There have been a bunch of different proposals, but I think the proposal that, to me at least seems like has the most amount of support and would actually go through in terms of implementation is this concept of like, fast blocks. And the idea behind fast blocks is that if you can prove that time was passing in between two bitcoin blocks, so there's a cryptographic proof that in between two bitcoin blocks, time passed, then you can start to differentiate between a bitcoin block that happened within seconds or after ten minutes or after 30 minutes and so on. So the l two can keep processing more transactions. Let's say in this proposal, they're targeting like a five second type of block time. So every 5 seconds there's a new l two block for sax l two.
00:30:45.306 - 00:31:24.502, Speaker A: And depending on whenever the bitcoin block comes, all of those transactions blocks, they get settled on bitcoin. So from a UX perspective, I think it'll be a huge win for the users, for everyday users who are used to ethereum or other places without impacting bitcoin decentralization. So you don't need to change bitcoin at all. And this work, I think there has been a bunch of progress on implementing this VDF. So VDF is a verifiable delay function which enables these cryptographic proofs of passage of time. But the upgrade is scheduled to go live with what people are calling this Nakamoto release, which is a big upgrade to the snacks l two.
00:31:24.556 - 00:31:56.370, Speaker B: Right on. Okay. Kind of, again, comparing it to the ethereum landscape, or honestly, kind of the all l one landscape as a whole. One of the biggest challenges is really bootstrapping an ecosystem around a programming language. So of course, solidity kind of has the first mover advantage there, and that's what powers the ethereum ecosystem. But then you see chains like aptos kind of pioneering their own or their fuel and the fuel vm, they've kind of been talked about the challenges of bootstrapping that ecosystem around a certain programming language. So stacks is using clarity.
00:31:56.370 - 00:32:03.794, Speaker B: How has that challenge been presented to you, and how do you feel that the resources around clarity have been built out?
00:32:03.832 - 00:32:54.350, Speaker A: Yeah, so I definitely acknowledge that it is hard to bootstrap in the ecosystem around any language that is not kind of like solidity and EVM. So if you're EVM compatible, you're sort of like in one part of the world, in the landscape, and if you're not EVM compatible, it doesn't matter which language it is. I think the particularity doesn't matter it's basically if you're non EVM, then you're in a different league. So I would say the examples of successful ecosystems that are non EVM, the number one would be Solana. It's non EVM still. It was able to bootstrap that critical mass of developers, liquidity partners and so on. So I think that's kind of like the success case example, but I do think there are other places that are not EVM compatible, and it's more challenging.
00:32:54.350 - 00:33:53.030, Speaker A: So then I would divide the challenges into two parts. One is like just developer traction that are developers coming? Are they building? And then the second is sort of like these integrations with different third parties, different liquidity providers and so on. And where I see the ecosystem right now is that I think the developers are able to overcome that hurdle rather with some effort, right? And some developers love the language. There's a reason why the designer kind of like picked it. It's safer, right? It's decidable, meaning you can easily reason about what the program is doing. But even I would argue it has better ux for the end user. If you try using metamask effectively, there is a compiled piece of code that is sometimes shown to the user, and then it's like you have to click accept or not whatever this code is doing.
00:33:53.030 - 00:34:51.626, Speaker A: It's scary as hell, right? I would consider myself a pretty advanced computer user. And then it's scary as hell that I have no idea what this code is. And even if you show me the same piece of compiled code on my ledger or treasure, I still have no idea what it is and what it is doing. But I'm just going to click yes, because I'm trying to make a transfer or trying to make a trade or whatever. Whereas because clarity is not compiled and it has these post conditions, you can actually surface very useful information to the user that do you want to move these tokens? And yes or no, right? So I think there are some benefits that are actually really good for Ux as well. And usually you don't care what language people use to do all these things. So I think if you just look at raw data, there's something like 60,000 smart contracts published on Stacks l two right? Now, obviously it's not as much as ethereum, which the number is in millions, but it's still 60,000.
00:34:51.626 - 00:35:43.622, Speaker A: So I think some of the developers have been able to code build these things and they enjoy it. Like it might be a smaller community, but they really like it. I do think it's a bigger challenge when it comes to third party integrations, because over there, let's say it requires them a couple of weeks to integrate a EVM chain, but it requires them like six months to integrate something that is quote unquote custom or different from ABM. And over there, my thinking is mostly that if the carrot is big enough, they'll do it. So if you truly unlock bitcoin capital, which is kind of like the biggest thing, if there's a lot of BTC capital that is flowing in, there's tons of market opportunities, then they'll go to the effort and put in the wallet to actually do it. But yes, it is a challenge.
00:35:43.686 - 00:36:00.778, Speaker B: I love getting your perspective on all that. That's super interesting insight. I think it'd be pretty helpful. We broke down two kind of core components of stacks, and that's bitcoin settled transactions and atomic swaps. Can you walk us through really what exactly both of those are and how they work? And maybe we can start with bitcoin settled transactions.
00:36:00.954 - 00:36:59.726, Speaker A: Yes. So I think the worldview of people in the stacks l two ecosystem is bitcoin is the source of truth. I sort of view bitcoin as if bitcoin dies, the rest of the industry, it would be questionable that the rest of the industry can survive or not. If the price of bitcoin goes down, everything else goes down even faster. So I think if you look at bitcoin as the source of truth, it's the ultimate thing, the bedrock on which you're sort of standing on. Then by settling transactions to bitcoin, you're almost like saying that if later on there is some sort of a conflict and people don't agree what happened on a chain, or l two, whatever you want to call it, then you can always go back to bitcoin. So what happens with transaction on stacks right now is that, let's say you do 1000 transactions on stacks in a block.
00:36:59.726 - 00:37:52.866, Speaker A: When a bitcoin block comes, those are kind of like settled on bitcoin. The interesting property for an end user is that if you're booting up a new node for stags, you can look at the bitcoin history and independently verify that you are on the correct version of the chain. This is the property that proof of stake does not have. This is one of the big differences between proof of stake and proof of work that a node can independently boot up without trusting any other parties. And stacks actually maintains that property because of this settlement on bitcoin. Because a fresh node can boot up, you don't trust anyone on the planet. You first build the full bitcoin chain, then you build the full chain history of the stacks, all too and independently, as an independent user, you can verify that this information is correct.
00:37:52.866 - 00:38:57.106, Speaker A: So I think those are the type of benefits that come with settlement on bitcoin. And then the one benefit that I'll mention, which is not there today, but it is very closely related, is the concept of Reorg resistance. So, for security of a chain, a chain is roughly as secure as hard it is to kind of, like, come and reorg the data, meaning change, transaction ordering, or blocks and so on. So, for bitcoin, it's the proof of work security. We know it to be the most secure chain. And right now, stacks has a separate security budget, meaning that if someone wants to reorder the stacks blocks, even if they are committed on bitcoin, you can come and sort of, like, with enough money and resources, there is a security budget that if you have more budget than that, you can reorg the stack chain without reorging bitcoin. And in the next version, that is changing to 100% of bitcoin security, which is sort of like a benefit of this settlement that, okay, you already settled transaction on bitcoin.
00:38:57.106 - 00:39:50.570, Speaker A: Now, instead of having these protocol rules that are looking at the stack security budget, which is a separate thing, why don't we just look at the bitcoin hash power and the bitcoin finality, and use that for reorg resistance? That for someone to do reorg of the l two, they would have to attack the l one, and they'll have to basically reorg bitcoin, which I think is a much stronger benefit, because now, if your transactions got confirmed on l one and they got settled on bitcoin, now, you can say with a straight face that, hey, if an attacker wants to come in and actually undo this transaction or reorder it, they would have to go and attack bitcoin, which I think is a much, much stronger security guarantee, which is going live with the Nakamoto release. There was a part two of your question as well, in terms of one, was the settlement, and I think there was a part two as well.
00:39:50.640 - 00:39:51.686, Speaker B: The atomic swaps.
00:39:51.718 - 00:40:28.790, Speaker A: Yes, I think for atomic swaps, it's effectively the way the stacks are built is it has full visibility into bitcoin transactions. So if you run a stacks node, you're sort of, like, also running a bitcoin. And stacks has full visibility into what's happening on bitcoin. If a transaction happens on bitcoin, it can actually trigger a contract to do something on the stack side. By using this property, people have built these atomic swaps. One example for that would be the Magic bridge. I think some people have used it.
00:40:28.790 - 00:41:15.562, Speaker A: And the idea is pretty interesting that you have BTC and you want to swap your BTC with an asset that's on stacks. Let's say there's a stable coin, right? There's a stable coin that lives on the stacks, l two. And you have your BTC and you want to go from BTC to a stable coin in a fully decentralized way. That's actually possible today because stacks can read what's happening on bitcoin. So the way that magic swap or atomic swap works is that you would effectively send your BTC, and you know that my bitcoin will be only taken away from my ownership in the same sort of, like, transaction in which I'm getting the other asset. Otherwise, the entire thing will fail. So that's why it's atomic swap.
00:41:15.562 - 00:41:49.658, Speaker A: And I think that's super interesting because that can enable all sorts of use cases around BTC using l one. This is bitcoin that's on l one. So bitcoin sort of like stays on l one for you. And a related work is just trying to move BTC from l one to l two, which is a ton of focus in the ecosystem right now. My company, trust machine, is actually pushing that forward because we have a business interest in that. Applications that we are building need SPDC. SPDC is different from atomic swap.
00:41:49.658 - 00:42:22.746, Speaker A: Atomic swaps are sort of like your BTC. L one is being swapped into an asset on l two, whereas the SPDC peg is different, where you're trying to move BTC from l one to l two and then back in a decent life way. And the benefit of that is once you're able to move bitcoin liquidity into a more programmable layer like stack, then you can do all sorts of new things with it. You can use a Dex, like a fully functional Dex, similar to on Ethereum. You have uniswap and so on. Right. Okay.
00:42:22.768 - 00:42:37.326, Speaker B: I think that makes a ton of sense, and I feel like the last core piece of prerequisite knowledge we should hit is really the novel consensus mechanisms that you all use in the proof of transfer mechanism. Can you kind of walk us through how exactly that works?
00:42:37.428 - 00:43:27.678, Speaker A: If you would categorize, like, if there are classes of consensus mechanism, proof of transfer is very similar to proof of work. Right. It's actually very different from proof of stake or some other types of algorithms like BFT consensus or so on. So if there's a family tree of sort of like these algorithms, I would say proof of transfer is very like a plugin of proof of work or so. And even the motivation and the history of it comes from proof of work, where there was this idea on bitcoin, l one back in the day, and the concept of, like, proof of burn. So you would basically destroy bitcoin on the bitcoin chain as a mechanism to bootstrap a protocol or something. So the idea is that bitcoin is produced through proof of work.
00:43:27.678 - 00:44:34.418, Speaker A: So bitcoin is a digital energy, and now you can use that digital energy as input into another consensus protocol, so you don't have to do the proof of work. Again, it's like some people call it recycled proof of work, because you've already done the work to kind of like mint bitcoin in the first place. So with that in mind, when I say that it's very similar to proof of work, it's not the case that existing STX holders have any stay in consensus, whereas in proof of stake, it's the existing holders of the token that have control of the power for running consensus. That's not the case here. You have basically expenditure or some sort of energy coming outside of the consensus mechanism. In bitcoin's case, it's electricity that is the input. Electricity is the external thing that is coming into the system, whereas in proof of transfer, bitcoin is the external thing that's coming in.
00:44:34.418 - 00:45:18.894, Speaker A: So people are actually bidding in BTC, and they place their bids. They have a random probability that increases if you're bidding more in BTC, similar to if you have more hash power. In proof of work. Over here, hash power is sort of like replaced with bitcoin that you're willing to spend. So, in proof of work, let's say you want to be a big miner, you would need to have a lot of hash power, and you have to burn a lot of electricity in proof of, proof of transfer. If you want to be a big miner, you have to sort of be willing to spend a lot of bitcoin. And the final piece, and this is the part that sometimes people have a hard time wrapping their head around it, is that we are not actually destroying the bitcoin.
00:45:18.894 - 00:45:54.810, Speaker A: Like, in proof of work, energy is sort of like destroyed. You're not doing anything useful. The hash calculations are basically throw away. Those calculations themselves are not meaningful. So in a way, electricity is being destroyed and bitcoin is being minted. Whereas we could destroy the bitcoin that's coming in for Google transfer, but that would be a huge waste. So the way the system works is that we can redirect that bitcoin to other parties who are doing some useful work for the consensus protocol.
00:45:54.810 - 00:46:39.242, Speaker A: And right now the useful work is somewhat very simple. People lock up SDX capital and they're sort of indicating what is the right chain tip to be on. But in the future, the Nakamura will need this. Bitcoin rewards will be directed to folks who are helping maintain the peg, which is the transfer of BTC between the l one and l two. It's like try to think of the peg signers as a third party and they are doing useful work for the decentralized protocol and they can be paid because we have this luxury that, hey, there is a bunch of bitcoin coming into the protocol and can be redirected to other parties to incentivize them to do useful work.
00:46:39.296 - 00:46:46.080, Speaker D: Is that the first time you've given that overview before? I feel like that was literally perfect. I'm sure you've done it once or twice already.
00:46:47.170 - 00:46:52.442, Speaker A: No, I have, but I'm pretty sure every time I do it, it's a little bit different description.
00:46:52.506 - 00:47:23.014, Speaker D: Yeah, that was absolutely perfect. I really appreciate that. I guess I just want to hound in on one more point that we already discussed a little bit, but just to make sure the listeners are aware. So how exactly is, I guess, the security budget of stacks being removed after the Nakamoto upgrade? As in how? I think it's 150 blocks, you can kind of assume that the transactions are completely finalized and settled on bitcoin. But what exactly is the difference in architecture today versus what it will be post Nakamoto?
00:47:23.062 - 00:48:10.390, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a great question. Right. So right now, as of today, and it's the same system that went live in early 2021, stack has a separate security budget. And I think there are some benefits to that as well. Like for example, someone can argue that you're not opening up an attack vector on bitcoin l one where if, let's say there was a high value transaction on stacks and the only way for someone to reverse it would be to go and attack bitcoin. Someone can argue that you're opening up an attack vector here. But now I feel like the world has changed in the last two years where there's a ton of progress on roll ups on bitcoin and almost all of those roll up solutions are going to just follow bitcoin panel.
00:48:10.390 - 00:48:43.938, Speaker A: So I think stacks is going to be part of the class of solutions which are generally. So. I think the future version of stacks, just a side point. I think it's going to start looking closer and closer to how roll ups are even again. I'm one individual contributing to the ecosystem, but in my mind at least, I think bitcoin changes very slowly. And it might be four or five years until any opcodes or roll ups are introduced. So I think Sachs could actually evolve over time.
00:48:43.938 - 00:49:33.010, Speaker A: Where in the time between now and when the new opcodes come, it starts looking like what's called a sovereign roll up. And one of the big properties of a sovereign roll up is that it has 100% of a reorgan resistance of bitcoin. Currently you can fork the stacks ledger based on how much mining power you have in stacks, which is the BTC burned, not burned, but transferred. So let's walk through an example. Let's say that six blocks have passed in stacks and I want to create a fork. Regardless of what bitcoin is doing. I can basically just come in and say the parent of my block is the 7th block and I'm now building a competing fork.
00:49:33.010 - 00:50:10.474, Speaker A: Some miners on stacks might continue to build on the existing fork, but you are building a competing fork and at some point you might become larger, mean longer. If you become longer. Now the chain has a new default, like long fork. And you have successfully sort of done a reorg that is six blocks deep. And so that's possible today after Nakamoto release, someone wants to do that. They will literally have to go and fork BTC l one to be able to do that. So you'll have to create a six block deep.
00:50:10.474 - 00:50:47.574, Speaker A: And then again, if you want to do twelve blocks deep or 20 blocks deep, 100 blocks deep in bitcoin, it becomes exponentially harder to do it. That's why six blocks are usually. The probability of a reorb deeper than six on bitcoin is very small. So that's, I think, a big benefit of the upcoming release and in the paper that's out there. And again, this paper is a working product of a working group. It's a bunch of people contributed to it. And you would notice that there are no authors listed because it was almost like we should be listed and we shouldn't be listed.
00:50:47.574 - 00:51:32.434, Speaker A: So maybe just don't list anybody. It's a product of a working group. The paper does talk about this 150 block, but there is a competing proposal in the community right now. And I think I've discussed with some of you the challenge of actually getting even the latest information in the ecosystem because it's so decentralized. But I'm sensing a bunch of support that, hey, why even wait 150 block? Just follow bitcoin finality? Because all of these roll up solutions, sovereign roll ups or roll ups in the future, they're just going to follow bitcoin finality. So why can't we in the new version just follow that? So I would say, if you would ask me personally, I think I'm more inclined to do just the six block finality than layer 50 block, but I don't think there's community consensus around that yet.
00:51:32.492 - 00:51:50.080, Speaker D: Interesting. Yeah, I mean, the first thing I noticed when I started researching Stacks was just the forum. There's so much going on on there, there's a lot of contributors, a lot of people commenting all around, making different posts. It's actually super cool. It's a lot better than a lot of the top projects you see in Ethereum. So congrats on that.
00:51:50.530 - 00:52:31.446, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very interesting. It's very healthy sign. But I'll give you an example. Let's say there is some ongoing thing that can be improved, right? You would actually see if one proposal comes up and someone says like, hey, I have an RFC, here's an idea for how to improve it very quickly. You would see like six other proposals. I think it's a very healthy thing that people are independent and they're proposing their own sort of solutions. But on the flip side of it, the challenge then becomes that as a decentralized community, how do you pick one of them and move forward and enroll it? Right? So I think I shouldn't complain about that challenge.
00:52:31.446 - 00:53:12.806, Speaker A: I think it's a very healthy thing to have. I would much rather have this than. Nobody cares. One in two people are just proposing ideas. But I do think I want to acknowledge that it is a challenge that how do you now converge, different people, different proposals, into something that everyone agrees on and go through the sip process and so on. So it's not the case where I don't want to point fingers, but let's say you're a saw labs and you say, we think x should happen and they do it overnight. So things tend to happen much more slowly as a result of it because it's decentralized and no one is really in control.
00:53:12.908 - 00:53:41.202, Speaker D: Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense. I think governance is one of the sectors in crypto that I don't think anyone has a silver bullet for yet. So by all means, try whatever you can. But I did want to steer the conversation a little bit towards sbitcoin. Just because a lot of projects have attempted to make trustless bitcoin bridges. It hasn't really been done super well to date, I would argue. And then I also wonder, I guess, is there actually demand to use bitcoin in DFI? And I feel like that's a fundamental thesis that you hold.
00:53:41.202 - 00:53:55.570, Speaker D: But then you look at the rap bitcoin supply or some other bitcoin l two s that have attempted this in the past, and none of them have really taken off. So I guess, how does Sbcoin work? And how confident do you still feel in people's desire to use bitcoin and DFI applications?
00:53:55.650 - 00:54:43.798, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's a great question. And I would say that I've held this thesis for a while, that people call it the bitcoin thesis, where the idea is, and again, it's not coming from me. Back in 2012, 2013, a lot of people believe that if there is an app or a use case that's successful on these smaller chains now, those smaller chains are actually pretty big. Like Ethereum is actually a pretty big ecosystem. Those things will eventually come to bitcoin and they will be more valuable on bitcoin because they will benefit from the security of bitcoin, durability of bitcoin, but above all, the liquidity of bitcoin. And I think I would say part of that thesis very recently. So I held onto it longer than people would think I would.
00:54:43.798 - 00:55:46.634, Speaker A: At one point, there was all sorts of market data pointing against it. Like if you look at the period between 2018 to even this year, a lot of market data would say that no use cases are on other chains and nobody's building that one bitcoin, and it's just not happening. And I think this year with Ardinals and more recently with BRC 20, part of the t three is actually to make sure it is literally the case that the NFT, the same NFT, when you bring it to bitcoin and you store it on the bitcoin chain, the market is valuing it as something more valuable and higher price, and people are trading it. And I think there's a community of builders coming around and they're doing it. So I think if you look at some of the data for NFT trading volumes, and I know it depends on how you measure it, maybe you should be excluding BRC twenty s from it. But on some of these sites, bitcoin is now the number two internal trading volumes. Of NFTs and Solana is number three.
00:55:46.634 - 00:56:28.370, Speaker A: I think six months ago this would be unimaginable. Bitcoin was not even on the map. So I would say part of that thesis is playing out. It hasn't played out in d five yet. And I'm very confident in the yet because I think that to me it's just so obvious that bitcoin is ethereum is 250,000,000,000 of capital, and I think around 33% of that is actively deployed in contracts and so on. And bitcoin is the more pristine capital. Right? A lot more people are sort of like bought into the idea of bitcoin as money or bitcoin as a potential reserve currency and so on, but it is not being utilized.
00:56:28.370 - 00:57:22.934, Speaker A: And I think a lot of it has to do with just the infrastructure and the tooling and the wallets and the developer community around bitcoin versus any fundamental thing that people just don't want to use their bitcoin in things because there's so many counterexamples. Right. RSD, for example, they did their fundraising in bitcoin and I think 25,000 BTC came in into that raise. Even if there are some protocols on bitcoin, even right now, there are these privacy tumblers that are seeing something like 7000 BTC being used. And these are clunky things. These are really clunky, bad Ux type things with not even that good privacy. It's the best you can do on l one, but it's nothing close to a ZK based solution that has great ux.
00:57:22.934 - 00:57:49.938, Speaker A: And people can very easily kind of can mix their coins and get fresh ones out. And I think if you start bringing those use cases, to me it's as obvious as putting two and two together that people will use bitcoin. But the challenge really is in the infrastructure tooling devs UX wallets. I think that needs to be much more mature than the state that we are in today.
00:57:50.024 - 00:58:08.922, Speaker B: One of the other interesting things kind of going on is the idea of subnets. And I think some of our listeners might be super familiar with how avalanche uses these, but I believe they're kind of relatively similar in the intent and purpose of the subnet and the stacks ecosystem. So what kind of security guarantees will a stack subnet have?
00:58:08.976 - 00:58:59.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I think subnets are one scalability solution that one company in the ecosystem, hero systems, has been working on. And the idea of subnets is very similar to avalanche. Right? Like subnets can be more personalized. They could be more private if you want them to be. So if you are a large enterprise or you are a group of enterprises who want to have a blockchain like system, but you want more control as well, I think subnets sort of make sense. And the interesting thing here with the way subnets are evolving in this ecosystem is, I think again, because it's connected to bitcoin, the unique advantages are going to be one easy flow BTC liquidity in. So once SPDC goes live, I think you can then take SPDC from l two.
00:58:59.334 - 00:59:46.518, Speaker A: You can think of subnets as almost like l three into the subnet and use bitcoin in there, which I think a lot more people would be interested in. This is part of the thesis that bitcoin has the best brand. Bitcoin has the largest kind of like capital base. So a lot more people would be interested in using BTC in a subnet than some other asset in a subnet. So that's one part. The other thing is that I think the subnets, similar to stacks, can benefit from bitcoin settlement. So if you have a use case of like let's say it's a bunch of banks or whatever, and they don't feel comfortable using bitcoin, the public network and they're looking at some private deployments, subnets would be sort of like the best of both worlds for them.
00:59:46.518 - 01:00:28.946, Speaker A: They can control the subnet how they want, but they can still do settlements on bitcoin main chain. So they can later point out that look, these transactions that we are talking about, there's a proof on the public bitcoin network that we did, and they can reveal them later on if they sort of want to. So I think the idea of these bitcoin subnets is pretty interesting to me. There's an analogy with the public Internet, actually. If you look at the history of the Internet, initially they were competing standards to the public Internet, like people trying to build like semi private networks or other complicated networks. But the TCP IP based public and larger took off and then everybody started using it. That to me is bitcoin.
01:00:28.946 - 01:01:01.790, Speaker A: That is the simple thing that is public. Everybody uses it. But then people, instead of having their own private networks that were completely disconnected from the Internet, they started having these private lands that are actually connected to the Internet. So they do some things internally, but they have access to the public network. And I think these bitcoin subnets are sort of like that, right? Like they're not totally private, they're connected to the bitcoin l one. But they don't share everything with the l one, they benefit from it. But there are some private things that happen on the subnet as well.
01:01:01.860 - 01:01:28.602, Speaker D: Yeah, strong agree. I think a world of subnets on bitcoin is a very exciting future to look forward to. So definitely rooting for you as you guys develop that strategy out. But I did want to switch tune a little bit and just cover some of the stuff that I wrote in the research report that we published on blockworksresearch.com. There was three things that I identified. So there was bitcoin, Mev reorgs and orphan blocks on stacks the chain, and then also the stacks increase bug. So we'll start with that one.
01:01:28.602 - 01:01:32.538, Speaker D: Do you mind giving us just a little synopsis of what exactly happened?
01:01:32.624 - 01:02:46.450, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think the way to think of this is proof of transfer is implemented as a clarity contract, which has sort of like a special, it's different from a normal contract published. Think of that as like you think in terms of operating system, this code that is at the kernel level, it's not an application, not an application that anyone can develop, but it's really part of consensus. The pux contract is written in clarity and the initial version went live in early 2021 with the main net launch. And basically what that code does, you can actually view it because clarity is not compiled. So you can actually go to the explorer, view what the Purex contract is, how it's interacting with the transactions and so on. And that's the place where people lock their STX. And there is basically 4000 reward slots and people get an allocation in those reward slots and then those reward slots are used in the consensus mechanism where instead of just burning the BDC, bitcoin is actually sent to these 4000 addresses.
01:02:46.450 - 01:03:24.218, Speaker A: The number of addresses could be smaller because some people might own multiple slots that may be blocked in more capital. But it's basically the mechanism through which the protocol decides in a decentralized way where the bitcoin is going. So it's pretty important. When it launched, I think early 2021, very quickly, I think hundreds of millions of dollars of capital got locked. I think on average, I would say in terms of STX, I would say maybe 400 million. STX is the average that we've seen sort of like locked in the contract. And then the price of aust goes up or down, right.
01:03:24.218 - 01:04:12.506, Speaker A: So when it was $2, that went like close to a billion dollars. When it's one dollars, 400 million. But roughly speeding 400 million is locked there. And there have been many proposals for improving them over the year people wanted to do certain things where, let's say if I am withdrawing my capital out and I want to relock it, you have to vote like a cycle, and the cycle is few weeks, so you're sort of like leaving out on the rewards that you would have received if there was functionality. That said, hey, if you want to extend my lock and not actually unlock, first lose a cycle, then relock. That's one functionality. Another is I want to leave my capital locked, but actually lock some more capital on top.
01:04:12.506 - 01:04:47.974, Speaker A: You can't do it in the original contract. You would have to move capital to a new address, then lock as a separate address. And maybe you don't have enough capital anymore to get a slot versus if you could have combined with the previous one, it might have been easier or something. So think of that as various improvements that the community had that should be there. So over time a new version will develop pox two. And again, I mentioned the long process that happens in the decentralized community. How is this thing going to go live? It actually took a while to go live, almost, I would say ideas that were there.
01:04:47.974 - 01:05:40.538, Speaker A: Even late 2021, it went live like six months ago, or maybe less. So that was the first major upgrade to the pox contract. And it worked fine for a while until someone triggered a bug, right? And the bug was that someone for the first time called this function called stack increase. What the function does is that I have some capital locked and I want to put more capital on top of it. And the way the bug worked was that it would give you more reward slot than you have or than what you should get. So there's a bug in the code. What is doing is for anyone who calls tax increase, you get disproportionately large number of reward slots as a result.
01:05:40.538 - 01:06:31.522, Speaker A: So people can either repeatedly call it to the extent that you enter weird scenarios where the total supply locked is actually higher than the total circulation of STX. Right. It's a bug. It's a pretty sort of like a bad bug in a way, because it's impacting the rewards that other people are getting. Because now someone has these phantom capital locked, you don't actually have the capital, but the protocol thinks that you have a lot of capital locked and the rewards that should be going to other people, they are now actually to you. So I think the net impact of that to users is their rewards for that cycle go down. But realistically, practically, people have experienced that several times for various reasons, right? Like sometimes the stack price goes down, so their rewards go down.
01:06:31.522 - 01:07:01.758, Speaker A: Sometimes a lot more capital gets locked for a particular cycle, like 500 million, 600 million, whatever the number is, and they get less rewards. So I think for the average user, my take was just on the forums and twitter that people weren't that concerned. They were like, okay, fine, I'll get less rewards this cycle. But they view rewards as basically like reward, like a bonus that they're getting on top. And it's not like, hey, my capital is at risk. And I want to differentiate between the two things. The bug wasn't that, hey, your capital can be stolen.
01:07:01.758 - 01:07:36.186, Speaker A: It's like, hey, you receive less rewards this cycle. And then in the protocol code, there's a general design philosophy that if anything goes wrong with Pos, whatever it might be, the protocol sort of reverts back to burning. Burning is the safe place you go back to if something goes wrong. So this is how the community sort of reacted. They're like, okay, something went wrong, there's a bug. So we're going to revert back to burning because you don't require any community consensus or sip upgrades for that. That's sort of like already baked.
01:07:36.186 - 01:08:00.550, Speaker A: That's the default behavior. So the protocol reverted back to burning for one or two cycles. Two cycles, I believe. And then a new upgrade was shipped that fixed about and that went live. And I think very quickly that 300, 400 million SDF capital, I think it all came back. I think right now we're back to 400 million locked.
01:08:01.210 - 01:08:39.140, Speaker D: Great. Thanks for that in depth explanation. So I guess something I gathered from this was, had sbcoin been live since SDX stackers are charged with maintaining the peg signing peg ins. Peg outs? Honestly, if the STX stacking contract thought that one entity had way more STX than they actually did, couldn't they have signed a dishonest peg out? And then as a follow up question, why couldn't someone stack a bunch of STX, short the STX, and then sign a dishonest peg out?
01:08:40.070 - 01:09:22.186, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think, great question. Let me sector them out. So on the first part, there are effectively different maps that are maintained for what the state of the STX lockdit is. And there were a bunch of those maps that were accurate and only one particular one that wasn't accurate. So the SPDC impact wouldn't be there. Unless it was a different type of a bug where the SPDC specific information is corrupted, just like very specific on this bug. It would not trigger because it did not trigger some of the other functionality that was using the SDX supply.
01:09:22.186 - 01:10:27.430, Speaker A: Or is it locked or is it not locked? That's one thing. But I do think that the theoretical attack vector that what if the knowledge of the protocol for what the supply locked is gets corrupted? I think this bug wouldn't have done it, but it is theoretically possible that it can be done. So I would say that the response to that is, I think this is one of the areas where actually having clarity helps. Because the code is not compiled, the language is actually focused on safety. The language has a lot of tools that can help you uncover these sort of bugs even before you deploy this over here. I think a threat roll that the core devs did was more around, just better testing was needed. The language has the capabilities to try and find these bugs even before you deploy the code, but not enough testing was done even before deploying this.
01:10:27.430 - 01:11:00.602, Speaker A: So that was one of the learnings in the ecosystem. So what I would say is that fundamentally, any piece of software can have bugs, right? So SPTC, for this type of a bug, that, hey, the supply is actually different from what the reality is. I think it can occur anywhere. But I would argue that two things help. One is clarity. The language itself actually helps a lot. This is where you take the hit on the challenges of developers needing a new language and third party integrators like taking longer to integrate.
01:11:00.602 - 01:12:08.358, Speaker A: But this is actually one of the benefits where you can give better safety. And the second thing is that I do think that real world testing and use of the protocol helps. So this contract, the previous version, was live for like two years, and nobody discovered a bug, and then it was actually an upgrade that caused the bug. So it's a little bit like, again, this community might, I don't control, might end up doing something different. But my view is that as SBTC goes live, this particular contract actually gets hardened over time and doesn't change. This is not one of those places where you introduce new features every two months or every year. So if anything, this bug, in a way, glad that it happened now, because it taught a very expensive lesson that this is that part of code where you don't want to change it that much, you want to test it a lot, and then you want to leave it alone, let it harden, and not make any changes.
01:12:08.358 - 01:13:15.770, Speaker A: So I think that can be helpful. And while the other part of the question about generally, can you impact by market dynamics or not? So I think there are two parts to it. One part is that SPTC current design is sort of evolving towards a place where a lot of the parties that are involved or custodians who want to be signers and so on. They all are feeling much more comfortable in a position where at least 30% of the locked supply is sitting with, let's call them institutional custodians. They might be the coinbases or bitcoins parties or large exchanges and whatnot. So if that is the case, if 30% of the supply is sort of like sitting with people, which we're going to assume that they're not going to get hacked, right? Because if they get hacked, our industry has a much bigger problem than just the SPDC pack. Then I think it's an interesting dynamic because it is still the open system.
01:13:15.770 - 01:14:08.620, Speaker A: Anyone can become a signer, so it's very decentralized. Anyone can kind of come in and go, but you have a backstop. You know that at least 30% of the supply is sitting with people who are institutional, they are professionals, and if they get hacked, we will have bigger problems. I sort of like that design. I think if that is true, by the time SPDC goes live, other than the economic incentives part of it, I think just having that 30% supply in the hands of maybe physical parties would be very helpful. If you forget about this argument. Generally speaking, yes, you can sort of like short STX, try to buy a lot, but if you just run through some of the numbers, what's the market reality today? I think binance is the largest exchange and I believe that.
01:14:08.620 - 01:14:54.790, Speaker A: I went and checked recently, but maybe a couple of weeks ago, that says like 100 and 2130 million STX on there. So the total liquid supply on exchanges, and you can add up all the other exchanges. The total liquid supply on all exchanges is maybe 40% of the locked capital and consensus right now. So even if you buy everything that's kind of like floating around, you wouldn't have majority pile around on the peg. So that's not a strong argument in the sense that maybe stacks becomes more liquid. It's a ratio between what's locked already and what's available. And historically, I think the liquid supply has been a pretty small fraction of the distribution.
01:14:54.790 - 01:15:07.486, Speaker A: And the question would be, when grows, how does it change? And I think as long as the locked supply is very healthy, like a very large percentage is locked, it would be hard to.
01:15:07.668 - 01:16:01.310, Speaker B: Yeah, that's, that's interesting that you mentioned that as well, because thorchain kind of has this similar problem. Not a similar problem, but like a circumstance, it has to think about where you could kind of run that same shorting attack on thorchain and it would be profitable in some ways. So it's kind of like they made some interesting design decisions that kind of helped incentivize the ruben, which is the Thor chain token, to stay within that ecosystem. And so they aren't IBC compatible as a cosmos based chain, which kind of was like, all right, that'll help prevent going to Mars, for example, or some other lending protocol in that ecosystem. But the community is very aware that the amount on binance and other exchanges is this important metric. Do you have any mechanisms to maybe help incentivize or give reason to keep the STX token within the actually on chain instead of going to these centralized exchanges?
01:16:01.650 - 01:16:44.042, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think the biggest one is the bitcoin yield. If you look at the stacks ecosystem, I would say by far the largest number of users using anything in the protocol or yield going up. The bitcoin yield is by far the number one thing. So if it's the case that I think maybe 30, 40% of the supply is locked right now, I generally categorize tax as a small ecosystem. Right now, I think as the ecosystem grows, maybe north of 50% of the supply will lock anyway. So I think that would be a pretty healthy place to be in. And I think right now people are sort of like locking capital.
01:16:44.042 - 01:17:12.440, Speaker A: Yes, it has these side effects of your signaling to the protocol and so on. But with SBDC, you're actually doing active work. You're running nodes, you're signing actively. So from the health of the ecosystem perspective, if more capital is locked and more full nodes are there and more people are actively signing stuff, that's actually very healthy for the network. And then as a byproduct, it also reduces the chance of these attacks where you can go and buy up a very large portion of the supply as well.
01:17:13.290 - 01:17:56.210, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I do want to pivot real fast because I know we're running up on an hour, and I don't want to take too much of your time, but I think the bitcoin MeV situation is absolutely fascinating. So for the listeners, a little bit of background. F two pool, large bitcoin mining pool operator. They have like 15% of the supply, and they have been censoring out other proof of transfer miners by only including their own transactions. So then they can essentially bid a lesser amount and still win the stacks rewards, and they'll win because there's no competition. So there is a proposal live to implement a minimum amount of bitcoin that needs to be sent to STX stackers in order to ensure that they're earning their rightful yield.
01:17:56.210 - 01:18:27.566, Speaker D: So it sounds like a pretty good idea. But at the same time, the way I see it is because f two pool has the ability to exclusively mine blocks at certain periods of time, they could theoretically censor l two users, which they're not doing today, but they could. And then on the same token, it doesn't change the fact that if it's still profitable for f two pool to be doing this, why wouldn't they continue to do it? So I'm just curious to get your response on those we need.
01:18:27.748 - 01:19:41.366, Speaker A: This thing is basically a thing when the system was going live, the core dogs and a bunch of people, including myself, or that there is a potential here where if a bitcoin miner becomes a stax miner, they can actually mine at this discounted rate, where they're basically foregoing discounts, actually fees that they could have collected, and they're getting SDX cheaper than other folks. And at that time, interestingly, the idea was this is pre Nakamoto design, right? So the idea was that if you convince all of the bitcoin miners to do it, in a way, it's actually a good thing, because now 100% of the bitcoin hash power is actually securing the l two. And that's actually not a bad outcome. And then later on, people figured out you do get the 100% of the bitcoin hash power anyway through the bitcoin finality path instead of trying to convince the bitcoin to do it. And I think that's a cleaner, better way of doing that. And obviously you want to use these rewards. So in the old system, I would say some of the STX holders not getting these rewards, to me, frankly, not that big of a deal.
01:19:41.366 - 01:20:44.682, Speaker A: Like, we are prepared to build applications and use them, and those applications seems to be useful. But I do agree that for SPDC and SPDC, weren't there ideas on there at the main event? Do you think this yield is actually more important now, at least to me, because it is now an incentive for SPTC, and I think that's a very big potential problem if you solve it well, meaning that there's really smooth transfer of bitcoin between l one and l two and as decentralized away as possible. Today, people have incentives to do it because they're earning bitcoin rewards. I think that's a very. So it's a long way of saying that I wouldn't have been concerned about these blockchain in 2021, but maybe fine that all miners start being they're only bringing more security to a chain in a way. Now with SPDC designs, I do think it's an issue. But at the same time, my view on this is that the miners are able to do it because of the protocol rules that are right and they specifically allow them to do this.
01:20:44.682 - 01:21:24.402, Speaker A: And with minor tweaks in those rules, you basically take away their rewards. And again, I mentioned earlier that when there's a problem, six different proposals come out. And that is literally what happened with this thing as well. Everyone had their own proposal of what can be done, but all of them are think of this as they're trying to pick a point on a curve for how to pick the minimum bid that the miner should make. So they're interesting proposal. There should be nintieth percentile of the average of the last x blocks and so on. And people are actually not running models and doing any interesting analysis and calculations.
01:21:24.402 - 01:22:15.634, Speaker A: But if you zoom out a level, basically the protocol rule tweak says the miners. So they will have Jill be actually transferring BTC and B and I here. So right now, let's say they're only foregoing the bitcoin fee that they could have collected and they're mining for at a 90% discount. I think in some of the proposals, their discount goes down to even below 1%. So their economic cost is very similar to a normal for any rational actor. They will only do it and it makes economic sense for them to do it. And then I'll post like two other things in terms of potential impact on other users.
01:22:15.634 - 01:23:00.134, Speaker A: So I would say that bitcoin miners as a category always have the ability to try and mess around with l two. It's true for lightning, it's true for sat. It's free for any other future alto that might come. So that's not a new thing. It's basically like saying there's a malicious bitcoin miner. Is it malicious? Or somehow they're motivated by some sort of profit that they can make? And over there, typically what happens is that your belief is that bitcoin or incentive compatible system has other rational actor that it transform. So if one minor, let's say f two, doesn't want to confirm a transaction, the minor right after it would.
01:23:00.134 - 01:23:37.566, Speaker A: So if I'm a user, let's say I'm trying to move my funds and peg them into l three and f two, for whatever reason doesn't want to do it, that just means that I'll have to wait one more block. The next miner is going to do it. And I'll go in and I will use BTC and similarly I'll plug out. If FTP doesn't want to do it, that's fine. The next one would do. But I think the question would be why we're left to do one on board because they're just leaving out of bitcoin fees at that point. There's no advantage to them to not collect a fees because it's unclear to me what type like over here there was a clear benefit.
01:23:37.566 - 01:23:59.640, Speaker A: The protocol rules basically said that if a miner, bitcoin miner, doubt that they will earn more money was at the table. Nobody was corrupting people self collecting it on that issue might have been aware of for two years. Now there's a little bit of sense of urgency. Upgrade lives.
01:24:00.970 - 01:24:09.690, Speaker B: Have any other miners indicated that is it only f two pool? Just out of curiosity or has anyone else kind of noticed this opportunity and kind of stuck their hat the ring as well?
01:24:09.840 - 01:24:29.314, Speaker A: So far it's only f two pool and I think there might do it as well. It's also like in the grand scheme of things, not a lot of money. If you're a minor, there is some overhead. And this was my argument for why this wasn't an urgent issue. There is overhead. You would need to run stacks nodes. You would actually.
01:24:29.314 - 01:24:59.338, Speaker A: The cost. There's cost of people payments as well. You need somebody who is spending time and effort running the minor, optimizing it. Upgrades come in to upgrade data to let us protocol and so on. So if you look at in terms of how much money they're making, the order of like hundreds or maybe thousands of dollars per day. If you're a large miner, that's not a lot of money. It's not hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars.
01:24:59.504 - 01:25:20.866, Speaker D: They're making sure this fascinating. I did get a question inbound on dms asking have you seen an increase in stacks mining competition over the last few years? He was wondering what your steps are to increase that competition. And I know I'm throwing a lot at you right here, but I'll let you answer that r1 quick and then I'll get you my last one.
01:25:20.968 - 01:25:51.340, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that minor decentralization is a big thing. It's super important. One thing that happened with stacks 2.1 is there's an ability for having decentralized mining pools. So many different people can pull together and they're still sort of like doing one combined transaction on bitcoin. The main limitation is really economics on the all one chain. For example, let's theoretically run the numbers right.
01:25:51.340 - 01:26:34.154, Speaker A: We actually don't want to consume like 10% of bitcoin bandit on stacks mining. A lot of people would be yelling at us if we do that. So if bitcoin does 1000, 2000 transactions per block, you don't want 200 miners getting stacks mining. 100, 200 miners getting stacks mining. So I think this protocol, the way just the constraints work, and then there's always a question of bitcoin fees. There's a ratio between how much money is going to fees and how much money is going to BTC rewards. If you do get 200 miners, that actually means that a lot of the money is going to fees, which me as a bitcoiner is happy that bitcoin miners are making money.
01:26:34.154 - 01:27:45.380, Speaker A: That also means SBTC now has less than 10,000 less rewards. So that's the flip side again to me also looking at ordinal how bitcoin fees are where bitcoin fees are heading, I actually think that bitcoin fees are going to become a bigger problem than minor expense liability, right? Because if bitcoin fees spike to 500 sats, with the spike to like 1000 sats, then very quickly that single thing will be impacting SPTC rewards more than anything else. That's why I'm more excited about some proposals. I've contributed to some of them, which are now trying to view the next upgrades or versions of SaaS as similar to how these roll ups chains have sequencers. And then there's a sequencer that just publishes data on the l one, and then you all go. You can almost imagine a world where there's a different type of mining that is actually more decentralized, but the l one footprint of that mining will actually write small. So in a way, let's call them, quote unquote, lift the mining process away from l one.
01:27:45.380 - 01:28:17.740, Speaker A: You're still benefiting from bitcoin finality, and bitcoin re all that. You're sort of like less dependent on how much is bitcoin fees. And miners are always thinking about the maximum number of miners, a factor of how costly it is to send transactions on bitcoin. Because if you just lift all of this away from L one, and there's almost like a sequencer running, then there can be many more parties participating in mining without increasing the confused that they have to take.
01:28:18.590 - 01:28:37.570, Speaker D: Awesome. Thank you for explaining that. I will hand it over to you again. Minib, thank you so much for coming on. If you want to touch on really quickly, the Reorgs and orphan blocks, by all means get your two cent in. But other than that, if you just want to tell people a little bit more about where they can contribute, learn more about you, maybe your Twitter handle, that'd be great.
01:28:37.640 - 01:29:15.230, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think very quickly on the Reorg stuff, I would say that compared to minor efficiency and centralization, I would say the decentralized mining pool are short term things that can be impactful. Right now. There's already, I think, grants in the community working towards it, so it will help long term. I mentioned that looking closer to like a solve wound rollout with a sequencer is actually something that I'm personally very excited about. In terms of the orphan block issue, I view that as a very temporary thing. Orphan blocks, by the way, have always been around.
01:29:15.230 - 01:29:47.494, Speaker A: They're around in bitcoin. I was actually looking at a graph that the orphan blocked rate actually hasn't increased. What caused recent concerns were there were some orphans that were just deeper floats. So blocks aren't getting orphaned at a higher rate than they have been historically. That rate is somewhat constant. But what happened recently was that some of those individual flots were just deeper. So that raised more concern and that's no longer happening.
01:29:47.494 - 01:30:26.420, Speaker A: There are many small time upgrades happening that help that situation. But when the legal guy personally less concerned about it, all of that is going away with Nakamura because the bitcoin finality is changing. That explicitly means that orphans just go away. Bitcoin decides what is a valid block or not. So you will only see votes for the small fixed block bitcoin binding, and then those folks will disappear just like bitcoin posts, basically. I personally wouldn't want to spend too much time on a problem that is not that bad. And it's going away with an upcoming upgrade anyway.
01:30:26.420 - 01:31:20.630, Speaker A: So I would lose sleep. But in terms of contributing, I would say, I cannot emphasize this enough that this ecosystem is very different. It is very decentralized, there are a healthy community, and I think if people want to get involved, and I think we have been sort of like pioneers building on bitcoin and bitcoin l two space, and now there's a revival, like with ordinals and other exciting things happening. SPDC, to me personally, is one of the most important things that can happen. I think once people see bitcoin capital actually being deployed and easy, fast way, I think that's going to be a big aha moment for the industry that bitcoin has actually go to fancy and on anything else. I'm ashley on Twitter. That's my first name, nuneeb.
01:31:20.630 - 01:31:25.720, Speaker A: And generally always interested in building on bitcoin. So if you're interested in.
01:31:28.810 - 01:31:39.560, Speaker B: Awesome, thanks Auneeb. We will be sure to put those links in the show notes as well so everyone, all the listeners can easily find you and the great work you're doing. So thanks again. This is a great conversation. We really enjoyed you coming on today.
01:31:40.370 - 01:31:44.940, Speaker A: You our channel.
