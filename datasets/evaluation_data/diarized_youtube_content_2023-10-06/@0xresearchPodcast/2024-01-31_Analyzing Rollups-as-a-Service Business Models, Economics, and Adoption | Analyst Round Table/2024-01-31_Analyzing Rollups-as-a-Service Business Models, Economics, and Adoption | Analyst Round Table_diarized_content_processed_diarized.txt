00:00:00.170 - 00:00:28.600, Speaker A: I was listening to some of the Celestia dev calls over the weekend. Yeah, I don't know why I was doing that over the weekend. I guess that's just the people we are at heart. But the sheer amount of developer mind share that Celestia is attracting and hopping on one of those calls and just listening it back and hearing people from Adam community, Ethereum community, the Celestia native community. Then you got John Adler, who in my opinion is one of the biggest brains in all of crypto. It's hard to ignore the amount of attention that Celestia is getting.
00:00:31.050 - 00:00:47.830, Speaker B: What's up everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. March is just around the corner and I wanted to make sure to give you a quick reminder to not top tick your prices of your Das London tickets. If you use code Zero X ten at checkout, you can lock in a 10% discount on your ticket. Don't miss out on your chance to get ahead of the curve. I'll see you in London.
00:00:47.910 - 00:01:02.410, Speaker C: Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Today the Blockworks research team is back to bring you another analyst roundtable. It's Monday, January 29, and you have myself, Sam and Dan. Sam, you want to kick it off with some news and governance updates?
00:01:02.570 - 00:01:58.846, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So we see the uniswap Dow is starting to discuss the cross chain strategy of their decks a little bit more seriously, they're looking to incentivize key pools with uni incentives from the treasury on key pools such as ETH, USDC, USDC, USDT, and other pools that are pretty much critical for the smooth functioning of any ecosystem on any chain. It also mentions existing chain deployments like Zksync era and scroll, where dominance isn't quite as strong as they probably hope. But it also mentions chains like Monad as high growth targets that the chain can target and essentially continue to capture market share across other chains. So found this pretty interesting and tangentially to that. It's pretty busy for Uniswap right now. They have another proposal that passed on January 13, so we actually are a little bit late on this one, but it's a bitcoin side chain root stock that they're looking to deploy on this proposal is from the Michigan blockchain club.
00:01:58.846 - 00:02:36.330, Speaker A: So hat tip to those students over there. That's pretty cool to see them getting active in Uniswap governance. I know a lot of blockchain clubs are pretty active in uniswap already, but still always love to see that. But basically they are looking to deploy on rootstock, which is a bitcoin side chain that is leveraging something called merged mining. It kind of reminds me of eigen layer restaking in that bitcoin miners can run the same, I guess, the root stock client and redirect some of their hash to secure that side chain. So I thought that was kind of neat, I'll be honest. I don't know a ton about it, but nevertheless found it kind of interesting with the parallels between it and Eigen layer.
00:02:36.330 - 00:02:39.550, Speaker A: But that is what's going on in uniswap. Do you guys have any thoughts?
00:02:40.770 - 00:03:35.550, Speaker C: I think it's relatively interesting. Like, Uniswap has historically not paid that much attention to other chains, even outside of Ethereum. I know in the past half a year or so, they started to try out incentive programs. I know Garnet has done a bunch of research for them, but they haven't really sort of ventured out to smaller l two s or side chains, and for good reason. Right? I would bet that 90% of users on the sort of the EVM ecosystem are on Ethereum, arbitram and optimism today. So why bother with sort of like the operational cost that it will take to deploy on a new, smarter chain with 1% of the users? But I think they're probably at the point where we want to build our own brand and our own ecosystem, and we want to become like the de facto decks across the entirety of crypto. Right? And there's definitely a lot of value to building that type of brand.
00:03:35.550 - 00:03:55.560, Speaker C: And so, yeah, I think it's a natural progression for them to start using their incentives and their humongous treasury to start incentivizing some of these deployments on smaller chains. But you could see it as sort of like a venture, right? Like, no one knows how Monad will do, but if it does well, then Uniswap deployed on Monad will also do insanely well. Probably.
00:03:56.330 - 00:04:24.974, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm surprised we haven't seen more aggressive pushes like this out of Uniswap, to be honest. But at the end of the day, I guess it's a lot better to do this during a bull market when the token value goes up and the value of incentives, I feel like a broken record. I feel like I come on this show every week and talk about incentive value. But nevertheless, you're definitely going to get more bang for your buck as the Uniswap dow. And on top of that, that front end tax is significant, and it drives a lot of value back to the Uniswap foundation. I believe I'm saying that, right? Correct me if I'm wrong.
00:04:24.974 - 00:04:27.014, Speaker A: Or maybe it's uniswap labs that collect.
00:04:27.082 - 00:04:35.700, Speaker B: Yeah, it's labs, not the foundation. And it is significant. I think they recently hit over five mil, so it's not a small number. And that's probably in two, three months.
00:04:36.070 - 00:04:46.758, Speaker A: Okay, gotcha. Yeah. Well, you'd think having a larger presence on some of these newer chains, or even the ZK evms, it's pretty low hanging fruit for them to go out and grab. So all for it.
00:04:46.844 - 00:05:36.614, Speaker B: I feel like that's kind of the push and pull between. Maybe the longer thought process behind this incentive program, right. Is if we're really getting this world of a million chains, you have to pick your shots as a protocol and say, where are the users going to be and on which chains? And then those are obviously the chains that I want my application to be used on or incentivize use on to kind of make it that core protocol in whatever sector it is. Kind of generalizing this beyond uniswap. Right. If you're going to be a cross chain app, you need to think carefully about where those incentives flow, because you can imagine a world where you incentivize use on the 999,000th most used chain, and then you've effectively wasted all of those incentives because there's no users there. So it's just an ongoing problem, I feel like.
00:05:36.614 - 00:05:57.360, Speaker B: And I think the proper approach is wait to see. I guess it's kind of a gamble, right? If you wait to see too long, which chains are going to be the chains worth having a large protocol on, you might miss the initial early first mover advantage. But, yeah, I think you do need to think critically about which chains are getting incentives in this new paradigm we're in.
00:05:57.890 - 00:06:23.414, Speaker A: At the same time, though, it's like if Uniswap doesn't deploy there, someone's just going to fork their code and deploy it themselves and launch a new token alongside with it. So it's like, you might as well just deploy it under the Uniswap brand with minimal incentives. So that way you're like, kind of the early mover. You bootstrap the liquidity, and that can, as we've seen in the past, kind of develop a mode of sorts, but definitely like seeing Uniswap go in this direction. But, Ren, do you want to kick us off for the next, I guess, news update we got?
00:06:23.532 - 00:07:09.638, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. There recently was a temperature check snapshot for Lido Dao to choose a team to develop the wrap stake e bridge to BNB. I think two months ago was a pretty contentious issue when layer zero labs sort of launched their own bridge for wrapstick deep to, I think, binance, avalanche and scroll, and they got a decent amount of pushback. And I think this is something that a lot of protocols that are looking to go cross chain, whether that's for governance or for their assets issued, are sort of like struggling with what is the best bridge architecture. Anyways, the snapshot ended five days ago, and wormhole and Axelar won with 81.13% of the vote. Next was chaining CCIP with 14.12%,
00:07:09.638 - 00:07:48.690, Speaker C: and next was layer zero with 4.75% of the vote. And to clarify, wormhole and Axelar is like a joint sort of submission. So this rap stake deep bridge would be secured by both wormhole and Axeter. And I think this is a general trend that you're seeing in crypto. Rather than just trusting the security assumptions of one bridge, you go, hey, might as well use multiple bridges so that at least there's like a fallback option or sort of like a multi sig of bridges, right? And Unisop is exploring a similar thing for their governance. They did a really in depth sort of bridge assessment report, and they evaluated six different bridges for their governance needs.
00:07:48.690 - 00:08:06.280, Speaker C: And they also came to the conclusion that multi message aggregation is probably the best route for them. And I think they are actively developing something there. So it's just interesting to see how the bridge security landscape is evolving, given that it's one of the most sort of contentious spaces and sort of hardest to secure it to.
00:08:08.650 - 00:08:22.800, Speaker A: I'm kind of surprised by the results of this one. I definitely get having two different parties, kind of like winning the vote over two separate proposals, but Chainlink being such an OG, I would have thought that they would have garnered more votes. To be completely honest with.
00:08:25.570 - 00:08:45.380, Speaker C: I think I feel like CCIP has been relatively lackluster, though. I don't know whether a potential wormhole airdrop may have factored into people's voting decisions. But yeah, I feel like CCIP has been pretty lackluster. So I'm not too surprised to see CCIP, like pretty down there, to be honest.
00:08:47.110 - 00:08:59.320, Speaker B: Was there any discussion around why BNB was the chain that they're talking about bridging to? I think there's a couple of different reasons why. It's interesting, but I'm curious if the forum post detailed that.
00:09:00.410 - 00:09:21.520, Speaker C: I did not look too much into the forum post, but I mean, kind of similar to the unisoft thing, right. If you were lido, I would assume that you just want wrapstaked or staked bridge to all of these random chains so that if there's a chance that chain takes off, you become like the de facto LST on that chain versus someone else.
00:09:22.130 - 00:09:45.240, Speaker B: Yeah, and I mean, in all of the BNB has all of the top line, traditional, arguably questionable user metrics. They have high transactions, a lot of active addresses, high TVL, high dex volume. So ultimately, yeah, that makes sense to probably get your asset over there. Whether or not you think it's like a long term viable chain doesn't harm in bridging over there.
00:09:46.730 - 00:09:57.260, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely agree with that. But Dan, I know you've got some cool updates on our Celestia dashboard, so let me add that to the screen if you want to go over that for our.
00:09:57.710 - 00:10:45.334, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Obviously the modular thesis has been front and center for quite some time now, and we have seen a recent rise in some of those roll ups actually getting pushed live. So roll ups as a service, or Ras as it's being dubbed. Earlier this year, we actually have an interview with Neil from when Eclipse was still looking to be like that rasp provider. And it's really cool to see that actually come to hit production and rolls actually being launched to these providers and these providers doing their part in managing the chains for their users. I think there's questions around the economies of those or the economics of those businesses, but it's cool to see it live and in production. And so we have two main providers creating and launching roll ups that use Celestia.
00:10:45.334 - 00:11:12.190, Speaker B: Da Caldera, which launched Manta Network, and Conduit, which has launched a series. I think they're up to five now. We have all five of those tags. So if I filter this table here just for the word roll up, we'll see that there are six roll ups now live using Celestia. Six launched, known and tagged roll ups. Of course, there's a series more, right. You'll see the actual namespace that gets used is a hex encoded string.
00:11:12.190 - 00:12:02.418, Speaker B: The reasoning for that is you don't want collisions in the naming conventions you're using. Ideally, you'd build a system that always has unique naming conventions. So what Celestia has done, actually, is they're using the first 15 digits of a Shaw two five six hash. So the actual name of the network is a standard naming convention that actually details out that, oh, this is orderly network, but then you put it through a hash algorithm to actually get the namespace that you're going to use again to avoid collisions of namespaces. The pain in the ass part of that is hashes are by nature one way. So if you just see this string of hex coded numbers, it doesn't get you anywhere and you don't know what the roll up actually is. So there is a very manual process in actually getting these names, but we do all that hard work for you.
00:12:02.418 - 00:12:52.862, Speaker B: So as a blocker treat user, you are able to access this dashboard without the headaches that our team goes through on your behalf. It's cool to see the progression here in Celestia actually getting used. So this top left chart here for the viewers is data posted in terms of megabytes of data by namespace. So again, we're still seeing not a ton of usage. There's no way to go around that. For context, Ethereum gets about 700 or so megabytes of data posted to it per day, with arbitram and Zksync kind of leading the pack on the amount of data posted. But nonetheless, we are seeing this list populate from really just like encryption services that are more of like proof of concept, kind of gimmicky protocols to something that the long term vision actually facilitates, right, which is roll ups.
00:12:52.862 - 00:13:33.978, Speaker B: And so it's very cool to see that come to life. Orderly network and manta are posting the most data of these roll ups, but we have the options networks in Lyra and Avo live and active. I think it's something like 85% of DFI options. Volume is now running on Celestia underneath, as they like to say. Of course, the other side of this is the fees paid are incredibly minimal. And if you'd run the math out, Ren, our annualizer over here, as he loves to do, if you run the math out, like, even at max capacity. So Celestia has eight megabyte blocks that run every 15 seconds.
00:13:33.978 - 00:14:30.814, Speaker B: So if you max those out for the entire year, at the current tier price, you're making around four or $5 million of fees. So the fee revenue isn't that great even at max capacity. Today, of course, that's not your end state, max capacity, I think they want to work towards something closer to 100 megabyte blocks. So about twelve and a half times more capacity, and that's about 60 million or so in annual fee revenue. And you go again, that's still not a huge number when you're starting to look at the, I think we're at like a 17 or $18 billion valuation, fully diluted that math doesn't math and that takes you to the second point, I guess, which is the modular money idea, right? The idea that the roll ups on top of celestia are going to create demand for the token itself. I don't think you've seen that yet. I don't believe any of the roll ups that are alive today are using Tia as a gas token, but they don't necessarily need to use it as a gas token.
00:14:30.814 - 00:15:12.158, Speaker B: I don't think if you had meaningful activity that sucked TIa liquidity onto that chain and again created demand for the asset as a form of money or the modular money vision, that would be sufficient. I think. I think that's totally realistic to say that the modular money idea can definitely increase the value beyond just the raw fees that get generated by the chain. I think there's a bit of a circular error there, because does it become less desirable money if there's no fees being generated? I kind of want to say yes. Jury is still out on that. I think today, on this initial onset, everybody is just, the numbers don't matter today, and that's very fair. The chain is three months old.
00:15:12.158 - 00:16:03.070, Speaker B: Nobody takes the revenue numbers of a three month old startup and uses that as like their investment thesis. I think what you'll probably end up seeing is something along the lines of vertical integration or service offering expansion. They'll do something as I think they're going to have to cannibalize some of their settlement layers that they're da and settlement go hand in hand. So right now they're using dimensions, basically this settlement like layer that is using celestia for DA. I kind of think they'll have to cannibalize that at one point and get TIa exported more easily to these roll ups if they really want the demand to be driven to these roll ups for TIA. So I don't know, the jury is really still out. I am obviously a data fanatic, so I think the modular vision is very broken in a lot of ways when you start thinking about the data aspect.
00:16:03.070 - 00:16:09.140, Speaker B: But I guess I'll pause there on my ramble and I'm curious what you guys think about all of that.
00:16:10.790 - 00:16:55.362, Speaker A: I guess we had one other, I guess, news update is that literally 30 minutes ago, before we started recording, Starknet announced that they are working on building a blob stream implementation in Cairo. So that way Starknet l three s can leverage Celestia for DA, and I imagine they will open up the door for other DA layers like eigenda avail, et cetera, in the future. So that's something again every single chain and ecosystem l two in Ethereum world is building out a modular strategy. It feels like, and I think that's too big to be ignored, to be quite honest. And I was listening to some of the Celestia dev calls over the weekend. Yeah, I don't know why I was doing that over the weekend. I guess that's just the people we are at heart.
00:16:55.362 - 00:17:28.922, Speaker A: But nevertheless, something that makes me really bullish on. Like I get all the fundamental value. Cruel naysayerness, I guess. But the sheer amount of developer mind share that Celestia is attracting and hopping on one of those calls and just listening it back and hearing people from Adam community, Ethereum community, the Celestia native community. Then you got John Adler, who in my opinion is one of the biggest brains in all of crypto. He pretty much helps spin up optimism and the idea of optimistic rollups as a whole. It's hard to ignore the amount of attention that Celestia is getting.
00:17:28.922 - 00:18:03.960, Speaker A: And I'm also seeing more along the lines of like, Celestia and Ethereum genuinely aren't competing against each other. And that's a view I've held for quite some time, and maybe I'm getting that wrong. Maybe they complement each other really well. And because Ethereum is so bottlenecked at the DA capacity aspect of things that there is room for both of these things to live and enjoy, I guess the benefits of each, you know, growing the sum of all the parts is more important than a competition in a zero sum game, I guess. And maybe that's too theoretical for a Monday morning. But nevertheless, I find it cool.
00:18:05.050 - 00:19:05.642, Speaker C: I want to say that Celestia has definitely capitalized on his first mover advantage really strongly. Sure, there are other DA options out there that are alive today, but Celestia has done such a good job, right? It kind of resembles like there was like a one or two month period like half a year ago where every other day you would see like this chain is going to be launching as an op stack roll up. It has similar vibes to Sedesa right now, and every project is cheating, like going modular. I think just last week, as dad mentioned just there was like Avo, there's Lyra, there's order D, there's plume, and it feels like that trend is just going to continue. To be honest and sure, Eigen DA is probably the other larger competitor, but it's not live yet, right? And Eigen layer has proposed 15 mb blocks, I think, versus Celestia six mb per second blocks. And at that point. The cost differential compared to using Ethereum as a DA layer is like 99.7%
00:19:05.642 - 00:19:42.582, Speaker C: versus 99.9%. It's very marginal. And I'm slightly worried for Eigen DA about that, to be honest. I mean, sure, you can make the argument that searching cost is like probably zero. Most rollerbads or service providers will integrate eigenda into their platform so that you just have to click a button and you're able to switch from Celestial to Eigenda or Ethereum to ignda. But say that comes out like Q four, 2024, right? By then, probably half the cycle is over. Half the protocols that want to deploy as a roll up for a roll up bid will have done so already.
00:19:42.582 - 00:20:09.786, Speaker C: And all of them are just going to use Celestia over Ethereum. And I think it's hard to overcome that, to be honest. Just that developer Mindshare and as Sam mentioned, Stargne, is building out like a celestial blob stream contract. I don't know whether a similar mechanism is necessary for Eigenda, whether they need sort of like a blob stream bridge, but there is certainly sort of like a developer ecosystem that's also steadily growing for Celestia.
00:20:09.978 - 00:20:48.470, Speaker B: Yeah, those are really good points. Sam, you first mentioned the developer community that coalesces around an idea, a concept, or a chain. I think that is a very understated point of value for a chain. Like, if you look at Solana right now, you have multiple teams working to rebuild and revamp the scheduler. You have jump teams coming in and building fire dancer building a new client. You have Eugene Chen, who's building a protocol. Ellipsis is the Devco behind Phoenix, and he's very involved in saying, hey, here's the problems we're facing as a protocol, and here's how changing the base layer would help not only us, but other protocols.
00:20:48.470 - 00:21:28.680, Speaker B: And you have this community of developers that are actually solving the problems that you hit, because even if you're a gen, two gen, three blockchain, you're going to hit problems, and you need those developers to coalesce and kind of fix these things and help improve the onboarding experience and all these things. And so that is remarkably invaluable. And I do think Celestia is dominating at that right now, which is a very promising thing to see for the chain. Ren, one of the interesting things you brought up was the switching costs are zero. And I do think that's true. If you play out the idea of a million blockchains, then roll up as a service providers are critical in the infrastructure of that's. It's probably not going to happen without them.
00:21:28.680 - 00:22:09.522, Speaker B: If your rope as a service provider has an integration for Eigenda near Da, availeda and Celestia da and Ethereum da, if you want to switch, it is literally a message in a telegram chat. That is it. That's the switching cost. And there's got to be a reason other than cost. I feel like because you're right, if I'm spending $100 a year or $98 a year, then the $2 isn't even worth the time it takes me to go type that telegram chat. So I think it will come down to branding. And as much as the alignment stuff is so dumb, it's not about aligning to the protocol.
00:22:09.522 - 00:22:55.966, Speaker B: There's a lot of games to be played with aligning to a specific narrative. And if you're somebody who needs to care about the token price for whatever reason, that's something you're going to have to care about and factor into your decision making is aligning to the narrative. Like we see that every day in this industry. So yeah, I think it is pretty interesting. And the last piece here is you mentioned growth. So I want to just highlight here that we do see a lot of potential growth coming online. So I mentioned that this namespace structure is like what you're supposed to do as a celestial roll up, right? You can use plain text strings, that makes them much easier to see and interact with but they recommend using this shot two five six encoding mechanism.
00:22:55.966 - 00:23:44.002, Speaker B: And so that's how you see these Lyra Avo public goods. These are the roll up as a service providers doing what Celestia is asking you to do. Again, this is permissionless, you can just name your namespace my name and it'll so to me when I see the technical method being taken, this is not some BS inscription chain that's coming live and being like this is roll ups, testing, launch. That is exactly what this is in my opinion. And so there's about 16 1718 chains that we have untagged that have only posted a few basically like a day's worth of transactions. I'm pretty positive that this is an indication that we have another batch of upwards of 20 roll ups coming online. So this trend is very much so only getting started.
00:23:44.002 - 00:23:59.560, Speaker B: And the growth that celestia has lined up for, honestly just q one alone is going to blow some people away I think. And again I don't love the modular vision but that doesn't change the fact that I can look at this and say, yeah, it doesn't matter if I like it or not, it's coming.
00:24:00.810 - 00:24:32.674, Speaker A: Yeah. And like you said, it's just like a telegram chat. It's like, hey, I think we're going to make a migration. Can you help us make that happen? And boom, you can make that switch pretty easily. But I think another underrated aspect is there's not a lot of tooling probably built out for a lot of this stuff. Celestia is definitely getting the upper hand there in that there's projects who have done the move before, run into certain problems, can send a telegram chat to other developers that they know in the industry, because let's be honest, it's not that big. And boom, that's a problem they ran into previously and they made this little fix and they can pass that on to someone else.
00:24:32.674 - 00:25:24.942, Speaker A: So I think the network effects are pretty dramatic. I was talking with Nick White over Telegram, who works over at Celestia, and I was asking if you can't quantify the number of light nodes in order to signal a safe increase in block size, the increased throughput, what are you going to do? And he basically came back with, that's actually not as much of a concern. The bigger concern is the block building process for validators. And that's like something I had not considered. So I'm very interested to see how that plays out because that's ultimately a problem that pretty much every chain faces is how do you sufficiently decentralize the block building process? And if you have these giant blocks that Celestia is going for, that's definitely going to, in theory, and might at least how it makes sense to me, is increase the validator requirements. So it's going to be interesting to see how Celestia actually scales once it hits that maximum bound of DA throughput, assuming we get 500 x, the current activity.
00:25:25.006 - 00:25:55.982, Speaker B: Okay, I was going to say that's still like, even with another 20 roles coming online, I don't think we're going to be ballpark close. I recently wrote a report that touches on this, and at the time of writing, it was before this recent batch of conduit roll ups went live. And shout out to the conduit team, I think they're absolutely crushing. They're doing things right. Their roll ups are paying cheap fees relative to some of the other providers out there. They're crushing. And at the time I wrote that report, sorry for the tangent there, there was like 0.1%
00:25:55.982 - 00:26:30.198, Speaker B: of Celestia's capacity being used. And when they hit 100% I think there will be a very strong reason to just simply expand the capacity. It's like an arbitrary block size bound that has to do with the light nodes and the other things you mentioned. Samden the amount of information needs to be gossiped across the cosmos. SDK but there will be growth. But we're still so far away from that number, it's hard to even reason about how we hit that. I think the number was like something like 4000 arbitram sized roll ups.
00:26:30.198 - 00:26:31.980, Speaker B: That's an insane number.
00:26:32.590 - 00:26:55.460, Speaker A: Yeah, that's truly mind boggling, to be completely honest. When you put it in that perspective, it definitely seems like a problem. That's not going to be a problem for a substantial amount of time. But what is keeping someone, and maybe you guys don't know the answer to this question, but what's keeping someone from attacking a chain by posting blobs to a specific namespace? That would essentially be their target attack.
00:26:55.830 - 00:27:00.834, Speaker B: Like if you were trying to alter the DA within a namespace, not even.
00:27:00.872 - 00:27:06.130, Speaker A: Altered, just like spamming Celestia under a specific namespace Merkel tree.
00:27:07.590 - 00:27:25.626, Speaker B: You could do that, right? But it costs money. And even though it's so cheap, it still costs money. But I guess if you just slapped in like an eight megabyte, you try to basically fill the block with spam, is what you're saying. Yeah, the barrier would be just paying the fees. Really?
00:27:25.808 - 00:27:29.878, Speaker A: That's interesting. I wonder if we'll see that play out at some point in the future.
00:27:30.064 - 00:27:55.298, Speaker C: I also think that if the actual roll up was posting data to its namespace and someone else was posting data to the same namespace in the same block, my guess would be that's just storing both versions of the DA for that block. But that's just a like, it wouldn't just try to overwrite one with the other.
00:27:55.384 - 00:28:03.746, Speaker B: I think Sam's just saying, what if I just spam the network with a ton of data and just to fill the block so other people had to pay more. Is that right, Sam?
00:28:03.858 - 00:28:14.634, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly that. And I mean, that'd be a worthless attack at the end of the like, why would you want to do that? But we also see a lot of worthless things go on all the time everywhere in crypto, so I could definitely see it happening.
00:28:14.752 - 00:28:25.534, Speaker B: Yeah, and Ren on your, like, you could just filter for the information posted to a namespace by a particular signer. So like the actual celestia address. And that would solve that problem.
00:28:25.732 - 00:28:26.720, Speaker C: Got you.
00:28:27.810 - 00:29:06.534, Speaker A: Okay, well, we have talked about Celestia a lot, so let's move on from that one. I've got two token unlocks on the news and governance updates segment here. So we've got op unlocks on January 30 equivalent to two and a half percent of the circulating supply, worth about 70 million. And DyDX unlocks on February 1 worth 87 million, which is equivalent to about 10% of the circulating supply. So these are still some of the supply overhangs everyone was super worried about with the DyDX unlocks. They're continually coming along, but we honestly have not seen that make a material impact in the DyDX or op prices for that matter. So bullish unlocks.
00:29:06.534 - 00:29:37.054, Speaker A: Maybe time will tell. We also have Picasso protocol on Salana, who launched sole restaking similar to Eigen layer launched on January 20 eigth. So Sunday yesterday. I don't have much of a take here. This feels a little bit weird. I tried to find their Twitter handle, Picasso network, and it seems like they were like a Cosmos project, or I stumbled on the wrong Twitter handle. I don't really know, but it just seems like there's a lot going on with Picasso.
00:29:37.054 - 00:29:43.430, Speaker A: I don't know if either of you guys have looked into this much, but any details would be highly appreciated if you have any insight.
00:29:43.930 - 00:30:20.370, Speaker C: There used to be a parrot chain with, oh my God, I'm blanking with polkadot. And I think that was, oh my lord, like probably two years ago. And it seems like they pivoted to this resaking. I don't have strong thoughts on Picasso itself, but I think the cycle. There's just going to be restaking for everything, right? There's going to be restaking for, obviously, Ethereum, restaking for Solana. And you're seeing restaking for bitcoin payout, like, pretty heavily. There's a lot of projects that are exploring, I guess not restaking, just staking bitcoin for yield.
00:30:20.370 - 00:30:46.330, Speaker C: And yeah, yield generation has always been very attractive in crypto, and now you bring that to this asset that has a spot ETF. I think it's just a natural progression of the space, to be honest. I mean, like, you could even say Polygon's Pol token, with its whole sort of infinite utility, or whatever they termed it, is a form of restaking.
00:30:48.110 - 00:31:10.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. I find it hard to believe that soul restaked will get much traction, considering the lack of traction that even just plain liquid soul staked has gotten so kind of a non starter for me. Plus, it just feels like copy pasta. And a last ditch effort, to be completely honest, from Picasso, which is terrible to say. So sorry to Picasso supporters out there, but that's just my honest opinion on it.
00:31:12.310 - 00:31:43.610, Speaker C: Yeah. Just one last note on Picasso. I do like the gamification element that they're doing. They have this NFT collection and you can act as like a vault manager and there's only 100 nfts and you're basically trying to get as many soul or as much so deposited into your vault as possible. And it's just like fun to see people gamifying such experiences. And I think that's a trend that has already played out and will continue to play out. But for the last news update of the week, we have UMA and its new product oval.
00:31:43.610 - 00:32:32.070, Speaker C: So it's basically an oracle update auction. It captures MeV that is a result of chain link price updates and is built on top of Flashbot's Mev share back run auction mechanism. MeV is obviously very widely studied, but I think oracle extractable value, not so much. But you can think of a perpetux whenever it updates its prices for traders to trade off, or for example as the index price for liquidations. There's probably a lot of money to be made given the growth of perpetux in the past year, and so just a quick rundown of the mechanism. At any point, anyone can place a bid to use the most recent price, most likely a searcher. These bids or bundles are submitted to one or more oval nodes by searchers, which then act as proto Mev share nodes.
00:32:32.070 - 00:33:21.642, Speaker C: And then when these nodes receive the bundles, it places the unlocked transaction ahead of it, adds instructions for how to split the payment, and forwards the unlocked bundle to MeV share. That's a lot of fancy words, but it doesn't matter. It basically just means that you can pay for the right to be the one to update the transaction, and you can include your own transactions after that as a bundle. So if you were a liquidator and you don't want anyone else liquidating, you would pay to be the one to basically update the price feed through chainlink. And you also include your liquidation transactions as part of like an atomic bundle. And it's kind of like similar to when you are submitting a transaction through MeV share and you run an auction, someone backruns you and you get a bit of money. But in this case, it's likely that these protocols, mainly perpetuxes, would receive that oracle extractable value captured back.
00:33:21.776 - 00:33:34.170, Speaker A: Yeah, Ren, that sounds pretty cool. I'll be honest, I don't know a ton about it, so I'm just going to leave it at that. But we will head over to a quick word from Noble, thanks to our fantastic sponsor, Dydx. And then we'll get right over to hot seat cool throne.
00:33:34.250 - 00:33:49.378, Speaker C: This week, we have a five minute segment with Yelena, a founder of Noble, thanks to DydX. So thank you so much for coming on, Yelena. For starters, would you mind giving us a quick intro onto what Noble is and why we need a general asset issuance chain?
00:33:49.474 - 00:34:13.500, Speaker D: Definitely. Thank you for having me. So, Noble is a cosmos chain purpose built for one specific use case. So that's native asset issuance. So when asset issuers like circle or others sort of consider how to natively issue in other ecosystems, it's relatively straightforward. You deploy a smart contract, you mint, you burn. With those native capabilities in cosmos, it's a lot more kind of complicated and difficult.
00:34:13.500 - 00:34:58.890, Speaker D: As you all know, each cosmos chain is kind of sovereign from the next. There is no one sort of base layer, one kind of monolithic, kind of blockchain environment. And so Noble was really designed and kind of conceptualized to be that asset issuance platform for the entire IBC ecosystem. So you can mint, you can burn, you can redeem, you can issue something like a USDC on Noble, and you could have that be interoperable with every other cosmos chain, such as DyDX, in a permissionless kind of fashion. So we are very proud to be bringing native USDC to cosmos. In the last four months, since we went live, we've issued about $100 million of native USDC. DyDX is obviously a huge kind of component of that demand and that growth.
00:34:58.890 - 00:35:22.290, Speaker D: And in the last 30 days, we've done about $350,000,000 of USDC transfer volume. So that's USDC kind of being minted on Noble IBC out to DyDX, osmosis, stargaze if you want to buy a bad kid, and kind of many other chains like Kujira and so on. So that's noble in a nutshell.
00:35:22.710 - 00:35:37.480, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks for that quick update and getting the audience up to speed. In terms of CCTP versus IBC, do you expect the primary route in the cosmos ecosystem to remain IBC, or do you think CCTP will become that over time?
00:35:38.110 - 00:36:40.806, Speaker D: So, CCTP is a really interesting kind of protocol that does differ from IBC in kind of significant ways. So CTP stands for the cross chain transfer protocol. You could think of it as a kind of circle bridge. So it's a mechanism for me as a user to transfer kind of my kind of USDC natively on chain from any CCTP kind of enabled or CCP supported chain such as ethereum, arbitrum, polygon optimism base for now and have that USCC go to be minted on noble. So again, I have, let's say in the DyDx example, a bunch of USDC on v three. I want to take that to v four, which is a cosmos chain. I would kind of initiate a burn transaction which would call in the CCTV protocol that would send an attestation request from circle to say that the user who is kind of burning their USCC on v three is legitimate.
00:36:40.806 - 00:37:27.770, Speaker D: And then that would send a request for mint on the noble side. And then you would IBC that out to DuiDX. The user doesn't see all of these kind of steps on the back end, including the kind of request for burn, the attestation, the mint, the IBC, all they see is a one click transaction where their USDC is now being migrated from v three to v four kind of in the cosmos ecosystem. So I look at CTP and IBC as very compatible from kind of a use case perspective. Because if I'm coming outside of the cosmos ecosystem, I will want to use CCTP, but then when I'm in the cosmos ecosystem, I'll want to use IBC. So these are just different kind of messaging protocols to enable the same use case, which is this cross chain kind of activity.
00:37:28.830 - 00:38:01.510, Speaker C: So one of the traditional headaches of interacting with the cosmos ecosystem is the multitude of gas tokens that you need to obtain to use every single chain. Right. And with USDC issued from Noble, it seems like there is an opportunity for USDC to be this generic gas token. Kind of similar to how some ethereum l two s are thinking about like gas abstraction, account abstraction, and having paymasters. So I guess the question here is, what do you think of USDC as a gas token? And do you think that'll become commonplace for cosmos chains?
00:38:02.250 - 00:38:42.734, Speaker D: I mean, it's definitely a lot easier to kind of obtain USDC if you want to sort of use it as a fee token, as a gas token. Right. There's so many integrations with kind of centralized exchanges on and off ramps. It's a lot easier to manage from obviously, like a price perspective. You're not using a token that's very volatile or something like this. And so I definitely see that becoming more and more of a trend in cosmos. What a lot of ethereum folks don't know is we've actually had this idea of chain abstraction or gas abstraction for forever so you can use any IBC token as your gas on any cosmos chain.
00:38:42.734 - 00:39:28.846, Speaker D: So technically we could use the Dydx token as our gas token on noble. I don't think we would want to, but we could. And so that also enables any causes chain like DyDx or stargaze or osmosis to, if they want, use USDC as their native gas token, which of course originated from noble. So it's really a choose your own kind of adventure, so to speak, from like a feed kind of gas management perspective. But yes, this idea of gas abstraction is super important. I've run into many, many headaches of not having enough gas for certain transactions on other chains, having to top up and so on. So I definitely see USDC becoming kind of that kind of gas token.
00:39:28.958 - 00:39:51.420, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. As always, cosmos is pretty early with the tech, at least much earlier than Ethereum. Well, Yelena, that's about all we have time for today. I think that was really great. I think it gave the audience a lot of insight into what Novo is and sort of the role it plays within the cosmos ecosystem. For those that want to find out more about Novo or want to just hit you up, where can they do so?
00:39:52.190 - 00:40:18.034, Speaker D: Absolutely. Definitely Twitter or X. Sorry, I'm very active there. And please do kind of keep in touch. We have a telegram channel where we kind of share announcements and kind of information. So you can definitely check out our Noble announcements channel and then we will be updating our website and pushing that out. Totally new revamped website in the next couple of weeks.
00:40:18.034 - 00:40:23.300, Speaker D: So make sure to check out nobleassets XYz. And thanks so much for having me.
00:40:23.670 - 00:40:28.206, Speaker C: All right, thanks for coming on. Now moving on to our hot seat coolthrone segment.
00:40:28.318 - 00:40:39.020, Speaker A: All right, we are back with some hot seat cool throne ren the annualizer. I actually just noticed that you put that in your name for this episode. That is freaking awesome. So how would I kick it over to you to start us off this week?
00:40:39.390 - 00:41:14.286, Speaker C: All right, this week, the largest event of the week is probably Jupiter, and it's airdropped happening on 31 January, actually, which is a snipe problem given that this podcast will also come out on 31 January. But anyway, our good friend at Dune, Andrew Hong, made some insane dashboards for Jupiter for you to analyze the data. I'll give you a quick rundown. These are weekly stats. For the past week, Jupiter has seen $1.5 billion in perps volume and brought in $2.2 million in fees.
00:41:14.286 - 00:41:43.902, Speaker C: Its swaps have seen 3.3 billion in volume and brought in $1 million in fees. Its limit order functionality has seen 81 million in volume and brought in 31k in fees, and its DCA swaps have seen 56 million in volume and brought in 86k in fees. So if you add that together, that's roughly 3.3 million a week. And of course I'm going to analyze this so that equates to 172.5 million a year.
00:41:43.902 - 00:42:20.310, Speaker C: And then the next step of annualizing any fee generated is slapping a nice PE multiple on it. So in this case, I don't really want to be conservative, given that it's like Salana. Everyone's really excited about Salana. Jupiter's really crazy front end aggregator and so I think I'm going to go with something conservative for crypto at a 50 pe and that gets us to a $8.62 billion valuation. I'm not sure what is trading on Avo right now, but I think this could be really updated to be outdated, to be honest. But I think it was around their $4 billion valuation.
00:42:20.310 - 00:42:58.082, Speaker C: But I don't think anyone's going to care about everything. I just say they're just going to see like oh my God, Jupiter is making like $3 million in fees. That could be so much. And I wouldn't be too surprised to see Jupiter release more products with sort of like the stickiness of the users over time that generate more fees. I mean, the perps is a relatively new product that they only released two months ago and it basically generates more than 60% of their fees in comparison to swaps, dimmer orders and DCA swaps. And I think you're just going to see that trend continue. I do think that there are some problems with their pervs product.
00:42:58.082 - 00:43:24.822, Speaker C: I haven't verified it myself. I think like the Oracle updates are slow or something, or they're using some jank oracle, but I don't think anyone's going to care about that, to be honest. But TRDR, Jupiter makes a lot of money. There is kind of like a fundamental thesis for slightly ridiculous valuation. I don't know how much of that fee goes to the Dow or they go to the Dow or not, but it definitely makes money.
00:43:24.976 - 00:44:12.138, Speaker B: Yeah, none of the revenue flows back to the Dow or the token, but that was an intentional decision for the near term. I am personally incredibly bullish on that decision. Reinvesting growth this is the most high growth industry that exists on this planet earth, and not reinvesting in future growth is a death sentence in my opinion. I love the idea of tokens being a very interesting way to pass revenue back to users or profits back to users. But that's not how you start as a startup. That is an end state you need to build towards, not an initial launching off point. I think it's a phenomenal product as well, which is the one piece that it's like, yes, it's making a ton of money, which is obviously awesome, but one of the few apps in crypto where you use it and you're like, damn, that felt good.
00:44:12.138 - 00:44:13.680, Speaker B: I was happy with that experience.
00:44:15.650 - 00:45:00.506, Speaker A: Yeah, big agree on that. And I love how they're going for perps aggregation as well. I assume that's not against their own base of liquidity. Like, I'm almost positive. So correct me if I'm wrong there, and I assume they're aggregating from different perps venues in the solana ecosystem. But I just find the whole dichotomy of the front end of Jupiter as an aggregator becoming the dominant one stop shop for user activity in the salana ecosystem to be super interesting. In contrast to ethereum having really siloed liquidity and front ends across all these different decks, across all these l two s, across all these different perps venues, I think it's really cool to have one front end to aggregate all that, because ultimately it lets the entire ecosystem grow more, instead of it being more of a doggy dog world.
00:45:00.688 - 00:45:37.894, Speaker C: So Jupiter's per product is actually their own liquidity. They're not routing it to various perf dexes on Salana. I think they started off with caps at 20 million worth of liquidity, but today it's reached, I think 86 million is the last number I saw in Aum. And it's like kind of similar to a GOP contract. It's 50% USCC, it's a basket of USDC bitcoin, Salana, and maybe e. But it's seen, like, relatively impressive volume so far, right? I think it just reached like 87 million AUM, but it's seen $7.3 billion in volume so far.
00:45:37.894 - 00:45:50.890, Speaker C: And it's currently 47 million in open interest from 11,000 wallets. So it's definitely, like, a very widely used product. And if you look at across most of the stats, December was a huge month for Jupiter.
00:45:51.470 - 00:46:13.090, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, well, I stand corrected then. But nevertheless, perps is a cash cow. So I have no doubt that that is a place people will trade if they can sufficiently build that out and get some deep liquidity. Because let's be honest here, the perps landscape on Solana definitely is in the very early innings when compared to any other matured defi ecosystem like arbitram.
00:46:13.430 - 00:46:55.342, Speaker C: I think that's also an interesting dynamic of, like, the whole Og thesis of Solana was that you could build, like, Nasdaq on the blockchain. These limit order books should have taken off, but it seems like most people still prefer these sort of more crypto native products rather than limit order books such as drift and zeta. I need to go check the numbers, but I wouldn't be too surprised to see trooper doing a sizable amount of volume relative to drift and zeta, even though they have completely different mechanisms. One is like a limit order book. One is sort of like your standard crypto perpetux. Obviously, for sole markets, I think limit order books are doing more volume. But yeah, I just checked the AvO to it.
00:46:55.342 - 00:47:07.830, Speaker C: This thing's trading at 0.6 780, which I would guess is a $6.8 billion valuation. So it's not that far off my annualized number of 8.62 billion.
00:47:10.170 - 00:47:27.002, Speaker B: I think the other side of, yeah, sure, the tech might be different and not what originally people thought we're going to use, but I think we forgot that people like using good products. And again, Jupiter is just a killer product. So I think that's why it sees the traction it does.
00:47:27.136 - 00:48:18.262, Speaker C: I think one last interesting thing is that the founder of Jupiter said that basically everyone knows that 40% of the supply is going to be airdropped to Jupiter users or whoever is eligible for airdrop. And that's going to be split into four phases. Right? With the first one for sort of like the Jupyter core product. I wouldn't be too surprised to see the next one being for Jupiter's per product. But this is going to be a once a year event. So Jupiter is going to release 10% of the supply in this mega airdrop in January of every year. If you had asked me, and I had no context, I would have thought that that would happen faster, maybe in half a year cycles, but it's going to be three more years before Jupiter's last massive 10% airdrop.
00:48:18.262 - 00:49:08.374, Speaker C: And I don't know how that will play into the timing of various market cycles, but I just thought it was, like an interesting strategy. But it also makes sense because Jupiter's founder, I don't know how to pronounce his name, like Meow worm. Meow, has said that he's really focused on growing the product. He really doesn't care about revenue share, and I wouldn't be too surprised to see him wanting to build out this crazy brand and crazy ecosystem within the Jupiter platform. And so it makes sense to sort of spend one year doing the sprint building out this crazy product until you take like 80 90% of market share on Salana, do a huge air job for it, and then rinse and repeat, move on to the next product until you basically dominate the entire Salana D five ecosystem. Perp decks is probably the next. After that, I don't know, maybe like a borrowing lending platform to sort of destroy all of the other borrowing lending platforms on Solana.
00:49:08.374 - 00:49:11.310, Speaker C: I don't know what the last one would be. Maybe something Mev related.
00:49:12.050 - 00:49:16.670, Speaker B: Would you want to see that under the same token or new product? New token.
00:49:18.770 - 00:49:33.294, Speaker C: I think that would be under the same token. It's kind of hard to do a new product, new token, but that could be a good segue into Univot on Solana, unless you guys have anything else for Jupiter.
00:49:33.422 - 00:49:35.714, Speaker B: No, that's strictly why I was bringing it up.
00:49:35.832 - 00:50:16.306, Speaker C: So Unibot, probably one of the front runners for the Telegram bot trading meta, right? They were one of the first to have a token. That token went pretty high, but obviously now it's down pretty bad on Ethereum. But I think starting from November last year, when meme coins really took off on Solana, you saw all of these telegram trading bots pop up, right? Most notably bonkbot, which was doing incredible volumes, probably more so than every other Ethereum telegram trading bot combined. And so if you're Ethereum based telegram trading bot, you're like, hey, I want in on this party. It's free money, I'm not going to miss out. Telegram trading bots are obviously here to stay. So Unibot did that.
00:50:16.306 - 00:51:20.706, Speaker C: Unibot launched a new product on Salana, but they recently announced that they are going to release a new token called Unisol. So how this token works is that Unibot holders receive 80% of Uniso supply and 50% of revenue from Salana trades will go to Unibot holders and the other 50% will go to Uniso holders. So traders will receive roughly 20% of the Uniso airdrop. But it's important to note that the Unibot ecosystem fund and lp supply, which is roughly 10% of the Unibot supply, is not eligible for the air jobs. But TlDR if you're a Unibot holder, you're not getting diluted that much in terms of sort of like the amount of units so you get. It's not like you're getting completely hosed on this new product that's launching on Salana, you would still make a hefty amount of free revenue. However, it's only 50% of the revenue from Salana trades, right? That's going to uni bot holders, and then the other is going to Uni Soho holders.
00:51:20.706 - 00:51:45.146, Speaker C: And at that point you can ask. This is getting kind of confusing. Like, if Univot launches on another blockchain, is it going to launch another token? And there's a whole host of arguments for why you should launch a new token, why you shouldn't launch a new token. Obviously, a new token is probably a new chart. It's more money. I think there's arguments to be made against it. Velodrome and Aerodrome played out pretty bad when they tried to do their whole new token.
00:51:45.146 - 00:52:08.642, Speaker C: Old token strategy and aerodrome ultimately cannibalized velodrome pretty heavily. I'm not sure you see that same dynamic play out. Given that, I would guess users between Ethereum and Solana are pretty isolated between the two ecosystems. But I would love to get your thoughts on whether you think a new token for the same product on a new chain is a good idea or not.
00:52:08.776 - 00:53:06.294, Speaker B: They did put out an announcement real quick and they said that they're not doing another token. I don't know if that was due to community pushback or that was always the plan, I have no idea. But they did say, I think it's important here because I'm pretty against the idea of one product, one token, because I think the market structure, incentives right now, today, you should launch as many tokens as possible, because nothing trades remotely near any form of a fundamental value, and that will lead to more value capture for you as the deployer. Now, is that morally the best road to take, or is that the best thing to do for the future of the industry? Probably no to both. But from a pure incentives point, yeah, you should launch as many tokens as possible. The market will buy them and you will make money. That seems to be the meta for me.
00:53:06.294 - 00:53:58.520, Speaker B: It's like, what are the analogies that you can make here to some sort of real physical world businesses, right? Think about like Amazon started as selling books, right? And I don't know the true history of Amazon, but let's just pretend this is like, let's say the next thing Amazon launched is their web services, or AWS. They used the revenue and profits from the bookstore sales and the online sales to the R D to build the AWS business, right? Like those things are very interconnected. And imagine if they, instead of keeping the bookstore and online business only under the initial Amazon equity. And then they launched an AWS equity. Right? They built a whole new entity with a whole new company and put that public. Does that make sense? No, that does not make sense. They're the same company managed by the same person.
00:53:58.520 - 00:54:25.178, Speaker B: They're one company, they're just two products within the same umbrella. And I think you could probably make an argument where. Yeah, but as an investor, if I only believed in the AWS business, now, I could bet on that. And I don't have to take exposure to their online marketplace. I kind of sympathize with that. But at the same time, they're just not that separate. In reality, the profits of one fund, the creation of the other, and vice versa.
00:54:25.178 - 00:55:07.226, Speaker B: Or when online sales are down and AWS is high, you end up with a break, even revenue. Right. These are the examples I can think of that create some sort of analogy here, and I just think it doesn't make sense. And then we chatted about this earlier in the day, and I think it was Sam, you mentioned it would make a lot of sense if they were basically, if the revenue share made sense, because it's two different chains and you have to like cross chain communication and value transfer between Salana and Ethereum. Isn't that great today? So maybe it just makes sense. And they're reducing the complexity in the system by all of the value that gets created on salana goes to this salana token. But that's not true, right? 50% is still going back to the Unibot token.
00:55:07.226 - 00:55:25.586, Speaker B: And so you're just introducing more complexity. So I don't think that that was really the solution here. And I'm trying to rack my brain for reasons you would do this, other than the incentives to launch a token lead to more money. And I'm struggling. I really am. It doesn't make a ton of sense to me.
00:55:25.688 - 00:56:13.518, Speaker C: I think as far as the fee distribution complexity point, at first I was like, okay, yeah, that's going to be pretty complicated. But how Unibot is doing this is that everyone that holds Unibot on Ethereum, I think, gets a chance to fill in a form and you basically give them your Solana address, right? So if everyone does that, then it seems like you could probably do that for a fee distribution from Solana to you don't need this whole new token that accrues value. But yeah, I think you made a great point that the way the market is designed today and the participants that are in the market, it makes sense to launch a new token for this new chain for the similar product. Just because if Solana goes, Uniso will definitely go up independent of Unibot.
00:56:13.694 - 00:56:45.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is also part of the problem here is revenue share for a startup doesn't make a ton of sense. And now they're trying to force that into this scenario when you should probably just be taking the profits for the team and building more products and better products and improving your web app and expanding beyond just a telegram trading bot and offering more products and services and being live on more chains. That would make way more sense than trying to launch a second token, build this rev share mechanism. That makes sense. I don't know. To me it just feels like undue complexity.
00:56:46.530 - 00:57:21.638, Speaker A: Back to your more tradfi analogies, Dan. There is Brookfield Corporation, if you've heard of them. I think they're a big canadian company and they have like Brookfield Asset Management, Brookfield Infrastructure, Brookfield Energy, like all of these different entities that trade as independent tickers on stock exchanges. So that's kind of a counterpoint to that. But at the same time, to your point, returning revenue in a startup, what are we doing here? This is like a company that was probably founded in the 19 hundreds, if I'm being honest. And this is Unibot, which just popped.
00:57:21.654 - 00:57:22.730, Speaker B: Up in months ago.
00:57:22.800 - 00:57:41.306, Speaker A: Months ago, yeah. So I don't know. I don't get it either, I guess. Just like camaraderie and having a token on each chain so that way you can build independent communities. Because that is the tribalism in crypto. I understand that, but it does feel a little bit precarious, I suppose.
00:57:41.498 - 00:58:00.550, Speaker C: I think there's one more pretty valid point that Unibot wasn't exactly shy from talking about. It says specifically for Salana. The low total supply for Unibot creates unit bias, which is untenable for driving more attention. Unibot, I haven't looked at the chart, but I'm guessing it's at $50.
00:58:00.700 - 00:58:03.462, Speaker B: Disgusting. First of all, what are we doing here?
00:58:03.596 - 00:58:53.862, Speaker C: It's in comparison to with bonk, which are zero point something, you can't really blame them. It's the industry participants that have enabled this behavior. And they say that 84% of users that use trading bots are trading on Salana and 80% of the total volume traded on telegram bots is on Salana. Given that sort of unprecedented opportunity, I think it makes sense to give it everything you have rather than try to deal with an old token that has auto tokenomics like baggage to deal with. But I do think that there are questions that people will ask. For example, Unibot X, their sort of centralized exchange interface, rather than like a telegram interface, if that has significant revenue and fee accrual. Right.
00:58:53.862 - 00:59:08.746, Speaker C: Who does that go to? Do you split it like pro rada between the amount of sole tokens being swapped on Unibot X? Or do you split it just half? It's, it's a hard question to deal with.
00:59:08.848 - 00:59:31.134, Speaker A: I can add on to that too, while you're forking that, Dan. Like, I used Alfred, which is Stefan's Jesus, from flashbots, like telegram AI agent project. So I was like, okay, I'm going to try this out. I'm pretty bullish on that guy. He builds good shit. Terrible experience on Ethereum mainet. I mean, you're paying, it's solely because of the gas fees.
00:59:31.134 - 00:59:45.974, Speaker A: But in my opinion, telegram bots make so much more sense on Solana. For so Unibot to come into Solana and to actually dominate market share over there and see it dwarf its Ethereum volumes does not surprise me in any way.
00:59:46.092 - 01:00:13.386, Speaker B: Completely agree. I think it was a very good business move that they went to Salana. That is where the volume is happening. Look at this chart. When there was, back in the beginning of November, there was about $20 million of trading bot volume happening, all of which was on Ethereum. We fast forward to the last few days. We're seeing closer, above 60 million, 65,000,050 6 million of that was on Salana.
01:00:13.386 - 01:00:58.666, Speaker B: So there's been a clear shift in where this activity is happening. Now, the interesting thing is, when you break this down by the actual trading bots themselves, the majority of volume is happening, of course, on Salana, but then even more so on bonk bot. The bonk bot is this gray bar on this chart, if you're watching. They did about 38 million in, they do about 38 million of revenue, whereas bonk bot, which is the Ethereum version, I believe. I actually don't know if this chart doesn't look like it breaks out the salana volume for bonkbot, but nonetheless, bonkbot did 7.7 million versus the 38 of bonkbot did 38 versus the 7.7 million of Unibot.
01:00:58.666 - 01:01:18.018, Speaker B: Apologies there. And the users themselves are the same story. Right again. Bonkbot in the 20 to 30,000 range of active users. And that's of the about 50,000 total active users for all bots. Nobody's anywhere on their playing field, which is very interesting. Now, I want to quickly, this is made by whale Hunter.
01:01:18.018 - 01:01:34.138, Speaker B: He's an absolute beast when it comes to the bot market and all of the trading bots. But I'm curious if they broke out. Unisol. Unisol. The soul bot is still so new. I don't know if that's happened yet. But look at that.
01:01:34.138 - 01:01:41.626, Speaker B: Here's a great chart. So this is Unibot's volume. The orange here is Solana. The blue is Ethereum.
01:01:41.738 - 01:01:42.766, Speaker C: That is crazy.
01:01:42.868 - 01:02:02.770, Speaker B: And you're looking at between four to 6 million ish of daily Salana volume versus one to 2 million of Ethereum volume. Of course, this was a good business decision. But again, taking this back to the original point of should that be under one token or two? It's one is the answer in my opinion.
01:02:03.510 - 01:02:28.570, Speaker C: I have a super quick idea for anybody that's building a telegram trading bot. Basically build, most probably have limit order systems, but then build out something coincidence of wants, kind of like Kaosov, and then turn on a feasitch for that. Just look at Kaosov. They're exploring four different feasitch models. You can probably copy one of them and it'll work for you and you'll probably print.
01:02:30.670 - 01:02:33.770, Speaker A: If only we could code man, we would have made it by now.
01:02:33.840 - 01:02:54.242, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? March is approaching fast and I want to give you another reminder not to miss out on Das London. It is coming. It's right around the corner, and it's in March. From the 18th to the 20th, we have three full days of content. This is your chance to bump shoulders with some of the world's top executives and have open dialogue with both attendees and speakers. We're going to be focusing on a range of topics that I'll let Ren discuss for you.
01:02:54.296 - 01:03:31.070, Speaker C: First on the list, we have bitcoin, catalyst, the halving and spot ETF. Next we have a view from the buy side from investors on things like strategy, portfolio allocation and more. We also have a topic on rwas, tokenization and stable coins, which I think we can all agree are going to pay large role in crypto's future. We'll also talk about global regulatory frameworks like compliance, best practices, and the evolution of global standards that are shaping the global investment landscape. We'll also have someone from the institutional front to talk about infrastructure such as banking and payments, with financial giants like Visa and Morgan. And last on the list, the macro case for digital assets. So don't miss out on this monumental event.
01:03:31.070 - 01:03:40.222, Speaker C: Seats are limited, so be sure to register today by hitting the link in the description and using the promo code. Zero x ten to save 10% on tickets. See you in London.
01:03:40.286 - 01:04:20.286, Speaker A: But let's zoom through these last couple of hot sea cool thrones. I've got Polygon on the cool throne today. They just released a blog post last week on the aggregation layer, basically a thesis saying that user mind share liquidity activity is super fragmented amongst Ethereum L two s and that there needs to be a solution for that. The aggregation layer, or the AG layer as they're calling it, is a decentralized protocol that does two things. It aggregates ZK proofs from all connected chains and it ensures safety for near instant atomic cross chain transactions. So if this sounds familiar, it's because it is. This is kind of just different lingo for something else that every other l two ecosystem is working on.
01:04:20.286 - 01:04:55.670, Speaker A: But the difference here, in my opinion, is that v one for Polygon is actually launching next month in February. So within 30 days and v one will feature a unified bridge contract and a common proof aggregator for chains that opt in. And V two is expected later this year and it's supposed to support async cross chain comms. So expect that sometime within 2024. I just kind of like Maddox right now because everyone seems to absolutely hate it. If you look at that one year chart, it's pretty much the only token that started higher and ended lower. So I mean that just naturally makes me a little bit more curious.
01:04:55.670 - 01:05:37.160, Speaker A: It's been down only against basically every other major in the top 15, having slipped from at one point being number seven all the way down to 14 by circulating market cap. So I find just through my own personal bias, and maybe this is not true, but I've talked with a lot of different people in the industry and I always ask them, what do you think about the different ZK teams working in the space? And Polygon's team is always on that list when I'm talking to developers. So I think that speaks volumes. And I think that Polygon has gotten a little bit too much hate over the last six to twelve months. So I kind of think Maddox is going to have a little comeback run here in 2024.
01:05:39.050 - 01:06:30.360, Speaker B: The aggregation layer stuff is very cool. I definitely agree that they're not the only person building towards this vision. This has kind of been the end game, but the key, as you rightly called out, is the timing, right? I think ZK sync is building a very similar thing. Right. And it's going to be interesting to see how the competition between the two plays out because yes, competition is very important and it ultimately creates better products more secure systems, and that is crucial. But if you look at it strictly from the point of view of Ethereum as the base layer, if everybody is on the same proof system, life will be so much easier. And Sam and I were lucky enough to watch Alex from Zksync and Jordy from Polygon have a whiteboard session where they discussed the logistics of this when we were at.
01:06:30.360 - 01:07:49.730, Speaker B: I mean, basically it breaks down into you need to have the same shared bridge contract and then the same proving circuits, and you can blindly trust the other chains within the aggregation layer and they all get proved together. You get richer bridging, if you will, where you still async bridging, but as soon as a proof is posted, you can trust that the data on the other chain is true and valid. And then you can swap assets between chains again, because you're using the same shared bridge contract, so the assets are already in the same contract on the l one. It gets very interesting of what you can do, and part of me does wish that all of this would coalesce around one system from the start, but the reality is it's not going to, and it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out, because you get all of this induced friction, where if the two most popular roll ups are on different aggregation systems, right? So if one's on Zksync as a hyperchain and the other one's built on the polygon CDK, you won't get the benefits of communicating between the two. And so I'm a little bit torn on how this plays out, to be honest. And it's just kind of like the pains of the modular growth system is know. Yes, you have these things that will work and really reduce friction, but there's like constellations, and if you're in different constellations, the communication between the two will be very challenging.
01:07:51.190 - 01:08:21.898, Speaker A: I very much agree with all that, Dan. I still just can't wrap my head around technically the trade offs you're going to get between, let's say an l two that's using the same proof system as polygon, but an alternative DA layer, because this is ultimately for the modular world, the aggregation in the modular world. So clearly polygon is thinking about that and it sounds like they think they have good ideas around solving some of those, I guess, security sacrifices that you make. But at a technical level, I still just don't truly understand how this is going to work in practice.
01:08:22.074 - 01:08:33.070, Speaker C: I think there's also a lot of unanswered questions. I mean, sure it's really cool. You get like asynchronous atomic composability, but there's questions of execution.
01:08:33.750 - 01:08:36.930, Speaker B: I don't think it's atomic, though. I think it's just async.
01:08:37.430 - 01:08:40.206, Speaker C: I think for polygons aggregation, it's atomic.
01:08:40.318 - 01:08:41.554, Speaker B: Really? That's interesting.
01:08:41.672 - 01:09:25.234, Speaker C: But not synchronous. Atomic and inclusion, I don't know about. But, yeah, I think there's like a bunch of questions between proving costs latency. I think maybe for transactions that want to be executed or included, like minutes within each other, within one sort of roll of stack, that's fine. But I think there's this future in which researchers nerd out on is like, everything's like HFT and milliseconds. I can swap on this chain and then post it as collateral on chain b and then do something with that on chain C. And that's all synchronous and atomic, whatever other buzwords there are.
01:09:25.234 - 01:09:31.140, Speaker C: I think. Even though I don't think we need that future, we're so really far from that future.
01:09:34.230 - 01:09:36.546, Speaker A: All right, round us out, Dan, who you got?
01:09:36.648 - 01:10:01.194, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I'm actually putting sui in the cool throne this week. I think they've seen some very interesting growth in, again, those top line fancy metrics that people like to talk about. Right. TbL is up four x over the last three months. In dollar terms, that's the most growth on a percentage basis of any chain over the last six months in sweet terms. So kind of removing the price growth out of this.
01:10:01.194 - 01:10:27.694, Speaker B: It's up about two x currently. It's at about $400 million of TvL. And interestingly, this is right about where Salana was before it started its run up from $30 to. I think it's trading around 100 today. Salana was at an $18 billion market cap at this point, again with a $400 million Tvl, Suez at about one and a half billion. It's kind of an interesting comparison there. There's a lot more that goes into that comparison than just TVL.
01:10:27.694 - 01:11:31.174, Speaker B: But Dex volume is also up about seven x over the last three months. Again, this is the most growth of all chains on a percentage basis over the last six months. Cedis is the main Dex on Sui and its token is up about 100% over the last three months, but only sitting around a 910 million dollars market cap with an FDV about 100 million. So to me, Salana kind of proved, with its price action, ironically proved that the high throughput l one narrative is here to stay and their attention will not leave that narrative for the rest of this cycle. The jeto airdrop proved that these smaller chains can have very interesting wealth effects with some of their airdrops when they're protocols that do meaningful work for the chain. So aftermath is another liquid staking provider on SuI. There's rumors to know they're kind of going to be doing a very similar thing with their airdrop to their early users.
01:11:31.174 - 01:12:12.946, Speaker B: So there's getting some early attention around that as well. There is one interesting catalyst which I think there's probably debate around whether this is bullish or bearish in terms of token price. Token unlocks Swee has an unlock coming of about 75% of an increase of about 75% of the circulating supply in April. And these unlocks are from the series A and series B investor allocation. So some people look at that and be like, oh, there's token unlocks coming, they're dumping. I'm not going to be interested in that. I think the more malicious view or pessimistic view is there's Token unlocks coming from original locked up investors.
01:12:12.946 - 01:12:33.440, Speaker B: They've never had a better time now than to start talking about the chain to gain attraction before these unlocks hit. I think that's a sad reality of parts of this industry. And I'm not saying that's Sui specific. I'm saying that's like investor Mindset. Their job is to invest and sell tokens. That's literally their job. Of course they want to make money.
01:12:33.440 - 01:13:27.966, Speaker B: And then overall, why I find Swee interesting. I've kind of gone down the rabbit hole ever since Picaccio put Sui into our 2024 theses report. And it is the idea of the gen three chains kind of coming to life and fixing all of the pain points that we've experienced over the last ten years in crypto, conceptually makes a lot of Sense. Practically, there's a lot of hurdles to implementing that. But it's implemented Narwhal and BullShark into its consensus mechanism, which is the Crimdelli crim of consensus mechanism design. Right now, it's got object oriented smart contracting language with move, and the entire chain is built to be object oriented, unlike some of the other move chains. And the idea is that it will greatly improve the developer experience.
01:13:27.966 - 01:14:34.014, Speaker B: I know the Solen team, a lending protocol on Solana, is building their implementation for SUI. I don't know if that's launched yet, but one of their developers was tweeting about how the UX of actually developing this application on SuI was just such an improvement from that of Solana, that he was just fired up. And that's kind of proof that some of these optimizations they made at the VM level and the actual language has really made everybody's life a lot easier. Now, what I find to be some of the more interesting things on the chain tech level is we are desperate for things that make onboarding new users easier, and they enshrine those into the core protocol with ZK Login, which basically allows. I haven't fully grasped the technical aspect of this yet, so apologies here. I'm still kind of doing my research and talking in real time, but effectively what it does is enables you to control a wallet with your Gmail account. So obviously there's security concerns there, right? That's much different than owning your own keys and having your own wallet and self custodying your assets.
01:14:34.014 - 01:15:16.330, Speaker B: And if someone hacks your Gmail using DK login, they can probably move around your funds. So maybe it's less interesting for deep rooted financial applications, but things like social media and gaming, having somebody need to set up a web browser wallet is a barrier to entry that I think we really underweight in this industry. It'd be an embarrassing process for me to go to one of my Normie friends and be like, oh yeah, come use this new social media site. You just have to set up this web browser wallet. It's just not going to happen. It's actually not going to happen. And something like ZK Login where you don't even know that your email address is attached to this hex encoded blockchain address.
01:15:16.330 - 01:16:00.414, Speaker B: That is a beautiful unlock that. I can't believe I haven't seen more of this being discussed, because that will change the onboarding experience and that will bring more people on chain, assuming that meaningful applications get built on suite. Another thing there is they have native account abstraction, basically, right? So they have this concept of sponsored transactions where the user can send a transaction and anybody else can pay the gas for it. When that transaction hits a smart contract, the smart contract isn't even aware that someone else is paying the gas. Beautiful design. This is literally what Ethereum and the whole ETH and l two community is trying to build with account abstraction, and has thus far gotten no traction on it. It's still complicated, it's clunky, it's being added on after the fact.
01:16:00.414 - 01:16:48.126, Speaker B: This is what Gen three blockchains are supposed to solve. And this is a great example of it actually happening and being implemented and working. And then lastly here, the thing I want to call out is their transaction blocks versus traditional transactions in the Ethereum world. So basically they allow composable transactions where you can have different pieces of your transaction. So think like piece one is approve contract and then piece two is transfer assets or make a swap, right? That's a painful two step process when you're using Ethereum, mainet or any l two, and you have to go to uniswap to make a trade. First you approve the tokens and then you make the swap. AIP, I think it's 374, is working to fix this where you can make eoas great again and they can actually batch these transactions together.
01:16:48.126 - 01:17:24.300, Speaker B: Doesn't exist today. Gen three blockchain has this on day one. And with all the recent exploits we've seen across crypto, another interesting thing here is revoking contract addresses sucks, if anyone has ever done that. It's just a painful process. Like, yes, there's great ways to see the available contracts that you have approvals out to, but you have to go one by one and revoke them all down the list. And it sucks, especially with a wallet that has a ton of history. And a good example of why transaction blocks would be interesting is like you could batch all of those together in one transaction and the user sees one thing, revokes all access.
01:17:24.300 - 01:18:06.680, Speaker B: It makes a lot of sense. And the one thing that they're missing, and we'd hit on this earlier, is just the rich history you get with being a longer tenured chain. When you get that strong developer community that is passionate about pushing your product forward because it benefits them again, I think Solana has absolutely crushed at this recently. You've seen it come into fruition with multiple teams building multiple things on the core protocol level. And that's just something you get with age. You just need to keep grinding without being, I think missing labs is a pretty strong team and they're the ones behind this pushing it forward today. But that's a good measure of success is like, what does that look like six months from now, three months from now, a year from now?
01:18:09.210 - 01:18:49.886, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the right curve take here is like, okay, well, there's only so many developers in crypto who's actually building on suite. But I mean, if you just zoom out, there is definitely someone, especially in lieu of the US ETF spot bitcoin approval, there's a new person, probably dozens of people following down the crypto rabbit hole every single day. And for me personally, it took me probably six to twelve months before I fell further down the risk curve. After fully understanding bitcoin. So I get that this cycle already played out with Alt L1s last two, three years ago, and people today are probably thinking, nah, that definitely can't happen again. We already saw that it really doesn't work super well. We don't have room for another generation of new chains.
01:18:49.886 - 01:19:11.870, Speaker A: But I do think that people are going to come across these things and they're going to try them and whatever provides the best user experience. You're going to be surprised at what can actually gain traction in a raging bull market. So I agree. I think sweet is a good call out. I'm personally on the chain playing around with aftermath. As you know, bag buys aside, it was a pretty good experience. It's pretty easy.
01:19:11.870 - 01:19:13.418, Speaker A: Felt a lot like Solana.
01:19:13.594 - 01:20:04.080, Speaker C: Yeah, I do think that new shiny chain effect will always be there. And then you mentioned a lot of technological improvements and I think it's definitely debatable from a core blockchain architecture like what is the better tech? What's the better vm? What's the better consensus mechanism? And there definitely are sort of objective features such as the ZK login, which are really a strong benefit to the user experience. But I think crypto has also shown that better tech doesn't always win. There's a lot of other factors to consider, right? There's like liquidity, there's network effects, there's playing the BD game, whether you're doing that correctly. There's how much of a developer ecosystem can you build and developer support. And it's just a lot of factors to consider and whether you want exposure to a chain XC or not, that's like the very mid curve take.
01:20:05.250 - 01:20:42.540, Speaker B: Hold on. I want to respond to that because I briefly mentioned Narwhal and Bullshark as the latest and greatest in consensus design. But the other things I mentioned was intentionally not to do with. They have a cool consensus fast path that no other chain has today. But I only mentioned things on the UX improvement specifically because this just makes it easier to use the chain. And that stuff I find just so damn interesting. If you were a builder and you didn't care about what you were building on, you just wanted something that was like the easiest platform for a user to engage with the product you're building.
01:20:42.540 - 01:21:10.194, Speaker B: Even just the one thing with ZK login that feels like such a major unlock to me. Again, I still want to dive into the technical side to figure out, okay, am I just putting my email on the blockchain? That's probably not great. I wouldn't like that. I think the answer there is no. And that's the whole ZK piece. But again, if it's as good as it sounds on paper, shit, dude, it's hard to be bet against that.
01:21:10.232 - 01:21:40.410, Speaker C: For me, I think on the Ethereum ecosystem, if you had the ability to approve and swap and revoke all in one transaction, Ethereum users would have probably saved, I don't know, easily 50 million, 100 million in the past like four years on hacks. Right. I feel like that in and of itself is like a pretty big unlock. And obviously like, move based programming languages or like, smart contracts have a whole other house of benefits, including not being vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
01:21:41.330 - 01:22:04.900, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's just a natural progression. Even on Solana, that's the same story. They improved on that as well. And I'm not a smart contract developer. Right. So when someone says we built a language around being object oriented, since that's ultimately what you're doing and trading assets, that only makes so much sense to my mind. I get it.
01:22:04.900 - 01:22:34.990, Speaker B: ERC 20 is like you don't have actual tokens in your wallet. You just have an entry on a ledger that says Sam owns ten USDC versus the object model you actually do. You're holding the assets. They're tradable, they're movable. So conceptually that kind of makes sense. But Netnet, I think the takeaway there is it's purpose built for smart contracts and blockchains and making developers lives easier. And then we do have a sample size of one with the sole end guys being like, no, this was good.
01:22:34.990 - 01:22:38.190, Speaker B: The UX was great. I loved building on Sui.
01:22:38.690 - 01:22:43.774, Speaker A: Nevertheless, worth bridging over and trying it out, right? I mean, if you don't try.
01:22:43.812 - 01:22:44.666, Speaker B: Yeah, experiment.
01:22:44.778 - 01:23:00.886, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm totally with that, but. All right. This has been a lot longer than it honestly normally is, which I'm surprised because it's only three of us. We weren't able to raggle another blockworks research analyst on. So we'll be sure to bring back next week with four. But Dan Ren, talk to you guys next week. Thanks for coming on.
01:23:00.988 - 01:23:01.862, Speaker B: Appreciate it, everyone.
01:23:01.916 - 01:23:19.830, Speaker C: Bye bye. Hey, everyone, thanks for watching today's Zero X research episode.
