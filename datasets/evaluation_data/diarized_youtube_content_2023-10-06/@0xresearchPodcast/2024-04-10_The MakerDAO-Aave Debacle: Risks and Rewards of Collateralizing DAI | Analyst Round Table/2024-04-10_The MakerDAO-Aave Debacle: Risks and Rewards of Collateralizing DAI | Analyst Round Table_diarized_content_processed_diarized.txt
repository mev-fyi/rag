00:00:00.200 - 00:00:24.114, Speaker A: I just can't believe that interest rate. You said 17%, Ren. So you're telling me I can buy USDe and stake it and earn three times the amount as doing an under collateralized loan? As a lender in an emerging market like that is you're on crack. Like, under collateralized lending on chain is a great business for borrowers and borrowers only. Like, you're insane to be lending on those things.

00:00:43.988 - 00:01:08.194, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research.

Ren, do you want to kick us off with some news and governance updates?
00:01:08.494 - 00:01:53.730, Speaker B: For sure. Thank you, Sam. First of all, happy eclipse day to those who get the pleasure of doing the eclipse today, starting off the news and governance updates. First of all, we have a proposal to enable arbitrum stylists on Arbitrum one and Nova for those that need a refresher. Arbitrum stylus basically allows developers to build on arbitrum using languages such as Rus C C, and so that sort of removes the smart contract development constraints of purely using solidity that most evms or base blockchains have in the past. In addition, there's some sort of LTIP and stip snapshots going on right now. On other news, we have a bunch of deployments pancakeswap will be deploying on Monad Pancakeswap is probably live on eleven or so chains today.
00:01:53.730 - 00:02:26.674, Speaker B: It'll be interesting to see what devs deploy on Monad given this sort of like performance and parallelization and if there's any sort of like anything else that they need to change for the devs, if they already playing on there velodrome is going to launch its Dex on build on bitcoin, which is a bitcoin lt with EVM compatibility. I think that one will be interesting to see how many of these ethereum devs try to hop on into sort of like the bitcoin l two ecosystem. I'll take a pause there, but any thoughts between arbitram, stylus, pancakeswap, and velodrogen launching on this bitcoin now, too?
00:02:27.854 - 00:02:54.636, Speaker C: Yeah, I want to lean into Arbitrum Stylus. It's super interesting to me that it largely gets overlooked. Like, no one really cares about stylish. Sure, you see a couple of tweets about it, but no one really gives it any more thought than just, you know, a passing, a fleeting thought. But Arbitrum Stylus is a pretty big deal. It pretty much allows any rust c or c developer to go code smart contracts on Arbitrum. And then additionally there, they're composable with solidity smart contracts.
00:02:54.636 - 00:03:15.584, Speaker C: So you can have apps written, either language. So when you look at Monad, which is, you know, also doing innovation in the virtual machine realm, it gets so much buzz and hype, and VC's are all over it, and it's got a narrative on Twitter, and Stylus just doesn't see it, and it doesn't make much sense to me. And also, I want to lean into the LTip stuff a little bit, but I guess I'll give everyone a second in case you guys have thoughts on Stylus.
00:03:16.604 - 00:03:18.344, Speaker A: Keep ripping while you're cooking.
00:03:19.604 - 00:03:55.352, Speaker C: Yeah. So, LTIP is allocating a ridiculous amount of capital to protocols as incentives on arbitrum. And once again, I think it's overlooked. Like, when Stip happened the last time there was arbitrum, Dow gave incentives to protocols. It took weeks for people to really realize, oh, shoot, there's a, you know, half a million or $5 million fdv crypto token that's getting half of its FTV and incentives. So, I do think that it's. That it's actually a place that there could be some alpha or some edge found for those that are looking through which protocols were actually funded as a part of this LTIP process, generally speaking.
00:03:55.408 - 00:04:07.484, Speaker A: Matt, how would you say the stip went? Were any of the learnings from that implemented into the LTIP? And on top of that, is there any protocols that are receiving the LTIP that are particularly interesting from your perspective?
00:04:08.544 - 00:04:36.124, Speaker C: Yeah. So, stip is a tough one to. To evaluate. Um, if you look at it purely from a fundamental basis of, like, how much money was spent versus, you know, the transaction sequencer, the. The sequencer fees from transactions, you could probably go ahead and say that it was a failure. But I think that that's really a misnomer, because a lot of protocols who wouldn't have otherwise came over to arbitram are like, oh shoot, I want to be a part of this, you know, incentives process. I want some of the, I want some incentives from the arbitrum dao.
00:04:36.124 - 00:05:09.914, Speaker C: So we're actually seeing quite a few builders come into the arbitrum ecosystem. For example, even though synthetix was not funded as part of the LTIP process, they were largely interested in becoming a arbitrum focused, or at least having some focus on the arbitrum ecosystem. And we see this over and over again with other protocols. So I think from that perspective, stip could actually be considered a win for the Dow in the arbitrum ecosystem. I don't want to give any like financial advice, so I would just go say, look through the arbitrum forum post at which protocols got funded and do your own analysis there on the front.
00:05:09.954 - 00:05:53.974, Speaker A: Of velodrome, launching a Dex on build on bitcoin. I find that super interesting because the solidity flywheel, like solidly, solidly flywheel, not solidity, has actually kind of started to take off. Like, we didn't see anything because they launched in the peak of the bowl like beginning of the bear. So it was honestly the worst possible time for a solidly type protocol to launch. So it's kind of cool to see velodrome and aerodrome trading at all time highs, generating all time highs of fee revenue and seeing the most volume they've ever seen. So I think this is like a really good time, especially with the, the launch of runes here around the halving for, for velodrome to be going over there. I'm not sure if they'll actually be partaking in the runes protocol or not.
00:05:53.974 - 00:06:02.354, Speaker A: I'm kind of confused as to actually what, what they're building on build on bitcoin, which is Bob, I think is what people refer to it as, but nevertheless, I'll be watching that one.
00:06:02.894 - 00:06:30.710, Speaker B: I think another interesting point about Velodrome is obviously they launch a new token arrow for Aerodrome on base. Will be interesting to see if they also decide to launch a new token for their Dex on build on bitcoin. My gut feeling says no at some point. Like, you can't just keep on launching new tokens for every chain you launch them. But I don't know, it seems to have worked out for aerodrome pretty well. So that remains to be seen. A few other news and governance.
00:06:30.710 - 00:06:32.314, Speaker B: Oh, sorry, Rick, go ahead.
00:06:33.094 - 00:07:04.084, Speaker D: No, I was just going to ask, aren't aerodrome incentives also front loaded or like there's more dilution in the beginning, which is interesting if the token wasn't doing that great in the beginning, and now it has still rebounded out of the. Not in a perpetual downwards moment, but really starting to take off. So maybe this could be another curve like project where even though incentives are all the time coming in, they could still manage fairly well.
00:07:04.764 - 00:07:33.664, Speaker A: Yeah, I believe the first 14 weeks you saw inflation gradually increase, or not even gradually, like, pretty aggressively. And then from the 14 week period onwards, it, like, decays pretty gradually. So I think inflation is actually at the point to where it's going down now. But that being said, like, there is just inherently a lot of token inflation that gets baked into these protocols. So, like, I definitely wouldn't want to be holding velo or arrow like in the beginning of a bear market, if. If that makes sense.
00:07:36.084 - 00:08:03.864, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely reflexive, both on the way up and on the way down. A few news updates on the airdrop front. Tenzer. Season four started today. The claim is open. You can go claim and sell if you want your tokens, I think so far, mixed reactions. There's some to be, like, some people that traded, like, a huge amount of volume, and they were like, whales who didn't get as much as they would have thought, and a lot of people who didn't trade much and got more than they thought.
00:08:03.864 - 00:08:33.394, Speaker B: So it does seem like they utilize, like, some form of tier system, perhaps like, it wasn't as tiered as, like, something like Cheeto, where, like, there were separate tiers of, like, a fixed amount of tensor for each tier, but it does seem like there was some sort of tier. Currently, the token is trading at around 1.8 billion FTV. And that's in comparison to blast at 1.5, roughly. Sorry, blur at 1.5, roughly billion FTV.
00:08:33.394 - 00:08:57.854, Speaker B: You can form your own conclusion as to whether you think, like, the Solana NFT marketplace should be worth more than the ethereum, sort of like, gold standard NFT marketplace. But just one point, interesting point of comparison is uniswap and Jupiter. Uniswap currently trades at 11.6 billion FTV and Jupiter trades at a 14.3 billion ftb. So. And make of the head what you will.
00:08:57.854 - 00:09:29.946, Speaker B: Something else on the airdrop side of things, deep bug, which is a central demo order book protocol on SuI, introduced their native token deep through a soul bound NFT. The token is alive yet, but so far it looks pretty good. And I think that protocol actually does, like a lot of, like, volume in the grand scheme of things. Sure. Like, a lot of protocols on Sie do have a lot of incentives just from the Sui foundation I think, like, just every week, like, all of these protocols get like half a million dollar or something ridiculous. But still, it'll be interesting to see what it is. Like, the first big airdrop on sweet.
00:09:29.946 - 00:09:37.134, Speaker B: Given that, I don't think there's been, like, a large one so far. Any thoughts on those? Like, two airdrops?
00:09:39.274 - 00:10:34.074, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's always hard to do airdrop, especially following, like, the Jito thing where a lot of people suddenly got a lot of money compared to, like, how much they have put in. So I guess it always becomes like a trade off between do you want to incentivize kind of everybody or those who have really, really used the project? And if you go with the latter option, you're always going to run into the problem of, like, airdrop farmers who are going to get a big chunk of the incentive structure. So my kind of small thesis, I've been thinking about this, that this is something that we will probably, or like incentive structures or airdrop structures overall are probably something that we're going to be seeing a lot of developments in, or at least like, projects trying out some new stuff here and there going forward.
00:10:35.694 - 00:11:14.616, Speaker A: Yeah, the tensor one's tough for me to digest. Just obviously, it came like a couple hours ago, so I haven't had a ton of time to think about it. But NFTs have kind of been down only. And from what I'm hearing, like people were farming, you know, season one, it was like the end of 2022, I believe. So, like, if you were farming this thing at the end of 2022, you probably got absolutely slaughtered on the NFTs that you purchased, for starters. And then they didn't even heavily weight the season one and season two activity versus season three. So the people who came in post Cheeto Airdrop, and then you compare that to the FDV of Blur, which is obviously the de facto NFT marketplace on Ethereum, and it's trading at a premium to it.
00:11:14.616 - 00:11:51.864, Speaker A: It just makes it a tough sell for me. And on top of that, like, the proliferation of meme coins, like, it feels like it's just totally replaced the attention economy on Solana from jpegs to meme coins. And I don't know if I see that changing, to be honest. And you even look at Magic Eden's market share on Solana, I haven't looked at it recently, but you would think that tensor would have commanded like, a 95% plus market share over Solana volume, considering it was pre token. And granted, magic Eden is pre token as well. But you still see them with, like, 30% to 40% market share a lot of the time, last time I had checked. So I don't know.
00:11:51.864 - 00:11:58.264, Speaker A: I don't know if I would be buying tensor is, I guess, what I'm saying, but obviously not financial advice.
00:11:59.444 - 00:12:30.744, Speaker D: Yeah, but I mean, I think that's a good example of or showcase as well, how strong ordinals have been recently. Like, a lot of people want to trade those. And then I'm guessing that, okay, I traded ordinals on this platform. Let me as well just, like, trade my Solana NFT here's like, there's a lot of stickiness there. And as I think I mentioned earlier or on an earlier podcast that it was a brilliant, like, business move from Magic Eden to, like, push into this narrative and grow through that.
00:12:33.044 - 00:12:56.344, Speaker B: Yeah, that statistic that you mentioned, Sanders, a little shocking to me, to be honest. I would have thought, like, tensor would be, like, comfortably above 80% market share on Solana all the time. But, yeah, as Vic mentioned, I do think that could be strongly attributed to sort of like, magic Eden's command over, like, the ordinals marketplace and in that set of NFT traders flowing onto other ecosystems.
00:12:56.684 - 00:13:16.624, Speaker A: Yeah, you also, just to mention real quick, before you move on to the next note here, like, you can download their wallet, and that gets you extra points for Magic Eden. So, like, I think that it, like, breaking, nailed it on the head. Like, people download the wallet, they use it, and, like, they're like, well, I might as well trade Solana NFTs here because I'm getting, you know, magic Eden points as well on top of my ordinals wallet.
00:13:17.604 - 00:13:36.344, Speaker D: It also feels that the, like, tensor hive kind of died down. Or I remember it had to be beginning of the year when Twitter was full of people coming up with different strategies and just trying to get as many points as possible. And then lately, it has more been like, nobody really talks about that platform anymore.
00:13:39.524 - 00:14:08.364, Speaker B: All right, a few last news updates. Ellipsis Labs, founder of Phoenix Trade, which is a crankless, decentralized limit order book exchange on Solana race turning media in last week. And the last news update is that Antonio from DyDx said that Dydx before will introduce permission to smart contract support, which will enable powerful opportunities for Amms vaults, structured products, asset issuance, and a lot more to be built on top of DyDX. Any thoughts there?
00:14:10.904 - 00:14:55.306, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the permissionless contract support on DyDX is particularly interesting. The way I see it, likely they want to enable traditional Dex for swapping and a lending market. And then you could see a world where someone could build something very similar to Athena fully on chain, on DyDX chain, meaning a delta neutral stablecoin or something of that nature. So basically give traders all the infrastructure necessary to do delta neutral basis trading on DyDX chain. So I think that that's really, really cool. And I'll definitely be keeping an eye there to see if any projects actually go and build kind of what I have envisioned. Then there was also that interesting DyDX proposal that just passed to, I believe it was stake a portion of the treasury.
00:14:55.306 - 00:15:17.054, Speaker C: I forgot the exact amount to DyDx validators who were underrepresented. So to like smaller DYDX validators to help ensure decentralization of the network and its robustness. So that was a really cool proposal as well. So not only increasing decentralization to DYDX, but also getting some yield in USDC to the DYDX treasury.
00:15:18.034 - 00:15:34.774, Speaker A: It's actually in, that was a proposal by stride. So it's 20 million from the community treasury, and they auto compound the USDC rewards back into DyDX. So it's actually like a cheeky little value accrual opportunity that they capitalized on for the DyDX token, which I thought was pretty cool.
00:15:36.244 - 00:16:58.098, Speaker D: But yeah, going back to the permissionless deployments, that's a pretty interesting business mode, because if you look at something like osmosis, they also allow uploading smart contracts on their chain, but it's permission. So like the community has to vote on it, which I kind of think makes sense, because then that doesn't allow for anybody to like spam the chain with some like basically trashed smart contracts or whatever. But I do see the value in being permissionless or like the crypto ethos. And it's also a hard business model to get right, because for the underlying chain itself, it's like quite tempting, I guess, to start scaling vertically into the same like, businesses as the smart contracts or the new projects deployed on top of the chain are. So like, for example, on osmosis, there are already like perp platforms. But I think there would be a big incentive for osmosis to like integrate perp trading into the chain itself because it's. Or like the protocol or the project would allow perp trading itself because it's a like great value accrual like possibility.
00:16:58.098 - 00:17:03.934, Speaker D: But then again, like, you're basically disincentivizing anybody else to start building on the chain.
00:17:04.474 - 00:17:33.994, Speaker C: I feel like DyDX has always had this vision, though, of just purpose trading. Like, DyDx is one of those teams that I have to commend on. They've had this vision their entire time. Like, we want to be a order book, centralized exchange, user experience on chain. So we want to compete with binance on chain just for perps. So I actually think that, you know, even if they see some Dex or lending platform or something, do a ton of volume and have a great value accrual model, they'll actually just stick with their vision. Like, they've never strayed from it thus far.
00:17:33.994 - 00:17:35.934, Speaker C: And I don't think they'll start doing that today.
00:17:37.154 - 00:18:02.914, Speaker A: I think there's some really interesting things you could do too with, like, cross margin. Um, like, obviously, you know, DyDX is a cross margin exchange. So, like, exchange. So, like, it'd be kind of cool if you could use your perps position as collateral on an amm or a structured product or vault or some sort of thing like that. I don't know if that would get a little bit too messy and potentially introduce new risk into the system, but it'd be cool to see some of that come to fruition.
00:18:04.614 - 00:18:23.912, Speaker B: Big infinity poo's throwback rip. All right, now for a quick word from Axelar. Thanks to our fantastic sponsor, DyDx. All right, guys, for today's DyDx segment, we have JoJo's Axelar, co founder and director of the Axillar foundation. Thank you so much for coming on.
00:18:24.088 - 00:18:25.592, Speaker E: Thanks so much for having me.
00:18:25.768 - 00:18:31.844, Speaker B: Just for quick starters, do you mind just giving us, like, a quick 30 to 62nd overview of what Axelar is?
00:18:32.424 - 00:19:04.380, Speaker E: Absolutely. So, Axelar, the way we like people to think about it is that it solves the bridging problem, but it's not actually a bridge. All of you are familiar with bridges and all of the hacks over the past few years. Axelr operates one layer. Below it is infrastructure. It is a platform that allows bridges and other applications to build on top. To make an analogy, the same way that on layer one, you can build decentralized exchanges, money markets, NFT marketplaces, all those great primitives.
00:19:04.380 - 00:19:18.074, Speaker E: With Axelr, you can build chain agnostic versions of those applications across chain. Dex, cross chain money market, cross chain, NFT marketplace. So it's a platform that powers bridges, but all kinds of other applications as well.
00:19:18.774 - 00:19:25.834, Speaker A: So we had squidrooter on actually, a week or two ago. How are you guys related to them and the wider DyDX ecosystem?
00:19:26.414 - 00:20:06.234, Speaker E: Great question. So squid is one of these core primitives building on top of Axela and is the most popular cross chain decentralized exchange that's built on Axelr. What it enables users to do is take an asset, say BnB on the binance smart chain, and swap into USDC on Dy DX. As simple as that. A simple interface looks very similar to Uniswap, but takes an asset as input on one chain and gives you an asset on another chain. Now, for the particular use case of Dy DX, all of the collateral is in USDC. So that's the asset it delivers to the user.
00:20:06.234 - 00:20:44.384, Speaker E: And the other cool feature that it has is that it can do the whole flow in 20 seconds. We have what we call these express features with XLR, which allows applications to express their transactions. And we have these relayer services that take the whole risk on behalf of the user. So the user can actually get very seamless user experience, get their assets very fast on the destination chain while assuming zero risk. You have this kind of market making entities, that's one way to think of them, that support the user and take a very small fee in exchange for the service.
00:20:45.404 - 00:20:55.184, Speaker B: Gotcha. I appreciate that explanation. And I know Axelar has a lot of exciting plans over the coming year, so we'd love to hear what's on the Axadar roadmap for the next six to twelve months.
00:20:56.004 - 00:21:35.454, Speaker E: Sounds great. Sounds great. So we're onboarding many of the non EVM chains right now. Accelerator has just EVM and Cosmos chains, about 60 chains integrated to the network. But we have a big upgrade that's going to launch smart contracts on top of Axelr and make connections permissionless. So we're going to be adding Solana, sui, stellar ripple and a couple of other non evms in the coming months. Now, usually when we decide that we want to add a chain, the decision is informed by the customers, the applications built in on top of, of Axelar, and a big segment that we're focusing on is real world asset tokenization.
00:21:35.454 - 00:22:13.504, Speaker E: A lot of the real world assets issuer want to be launching on Solana because Solana has clearance from some regulatory bodies in New York, there's only Solana and Ethereum. They also want to be launching on Sui because that's a new ecosystem. There's a lot of excitement there, a lot of opportunity for new stablecoin issuers. I guess, given how close we are with a lot of these real world asset companies, we are prioritizing some of the non EVM chains that they want, and we have a lot of very interesting initiatives we're going to be announcing in the coming weeks and months on the real world asset side and also the work we're doing with financial institutions, that's going to be a big part of what's to come with Axlr.
00:22:15.124 - 00:22:30.304, Speaker A: Nice. Well, that is super exciting. And we'll actually have to get you on for a full episode at some point to get a bigger rundown of Axelar because I know there's a lot of nuances, but thank you so much for coming on. I don't know if you want to share with people where they can learn more about Axlar or where they can find you personally.
00:22:30.884 - 00:22:47.584, Speaker E: Yeah, for me, I mean, just follow me on Twitter. Feel free to message me. I always respond to people. Just type my name on Twitter. And yeah, happy to send you more information about Axelar, but I think just follow us on Twitter. We post regular updates so you'll be able to find all of the information there.
00:22:47.884 - 00:22:50.464, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much. We'll catch you sometime in the future.
00:22:51.354 - 00:22:53.186, Speaker E: Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me.
00:22:53.290 - 00:23:01.694, Speaker B: Now, moving on to our hot seat Kutzpun segment. I'm going to throw it over to you, Sam, this week for probably one of the more talked about topics in the past week.
00:23:02.114 - 00:23:35.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I got a Larp as a Solana expert here for a second, but basically, anyone who has used Solana over the past week or two has definitely realized it is incredibly broken. It's hard to land any transaction without submitting a request, like three, four, five times. And Nasheel on Twitter, we can be sure to link to this thread in this show notes, but put together a great explainer of really what's going on here. So I'm going to do my best to summarize it for you. So basically, there's three paths for a given transaction on Solana. Either one, it's successfully included and there's zero errors. So the transaction went through and it was executed successfully.
00:23:35.900 - 00:24:18.250, Speaker A: That's like the happy case. But then there's two where the execution actually failed. So the gas is paid, but the execution failed because of some certain unmet condition. So, like, for example, if you have too low of slippage set on an illiquid dex pair, there's a chance that that transaction actually reverts because the slippage tolerance was set too low. And that's actually the chart that's been floating around on Twitter that shows, like, 75% of Solana transactions have failed. That's like, that's the reason it's mostly arbitrage bots who are spamming the network to some degree in order to get their arm through, because transaction fees are so cheap that you stand to make more on the actual arbitrage, assuming it's successful. And you can, you can afford those failed transactions.
00:24:18.250 - 00:24:53.680, Speaker A: So that's not really the problem here. The problem is actually the third case, which is drop transactions. And this is the case in which the block leader actually never even saw the transaction request by the user. So the net, the networking layer is basically the communication layer of the Internet, and it's used to send packets from one data connection to another. So, for example, tcp. And then there's quic, which was actually designed by Google, which I found interesting in this thread. But basically, Solana uses quic, and it gives the builders the ability to drop transactions based on certain criteria in order to combat chain halts during periods of high demand.
00:24:53.680 - 00:25:37.730, Speaker A: And if you recall, Solana doesn't have a mempool. So losing connection here means that the transaction never actually makes it to the leader. So the problem is that even though block leaders can now, like, throttle certain connections, the logic on which the connections are throttled, like, the criteria that need to be met, are really, like, poorly implemented and buggy. So it's just not well defined, and it's a poor implementation of quic. So that's essentially what all the Solana developers are kind of all hands on deck trying to solve right now. But for the immediate term, it's not clear if any sort of patch or fix will actually solve the problem in totality. Fire dancers, of course, being worked on, which is supposed to address some of these quick implementation problems, but that's still six plus months out.
00:25:37.730 - 00:25:52.734, Speaker A: So it's really unclear as to when these issues actually get resolved. So I'll stop there. I don't know if you guys have any good takes on the poor Solana performance, but I guess it's a good problem to have is kind of my take. It means you're doing something right.
00:25:53.554 - 00:26:52.754, Speaker B: Yeah. I studied distributed distributed systems engineering over the weekend, and so I'm now like a PhD in network engineering, from what I heard. I'm kidding. I'm not going to pretend to know that much about the networking layer of Solana, but I think there's two ways you can sort of fixes, right? One is like, fixing the networking layer, and there's, like, a bunch of, like, optimizations that a bunch of teams, including, like, anza, which is kind of like a spun out, like, team from the Solana foundation or labs, are working on, like, the client they're working on, like, fixes to like the networking component. But the other side of this equation is also like the fee market, right? Traditionally, Solana has struggled with fee market design. Their base fee is still like a fixed fee per signature, and it doesn't take into account the number of compute units that a transaction utilizes. And so there is like a quite a large incentive for these arbitrage bots to spam the network at a relatively low cost.
00:26:52.754 - 00:27:32.226, Speaker B: And so I think the eventual fix for this is both a combination of fixes to the networking layer and also fixes to the sort of fee mechanism. And I know, like, a lot of people are hyped about 1.18, and so, like, the new scheduler that's coming out. But I don't think that's going to help this or, like, help what Solana is experiencing that much, because that's at the point where the transactions actually reach the block leader. But right now, the transactions aren't even reaching the block either because of these network and propagation issues. So, yeah, I don't know when it would get fixed. But not going to lie, Solana does feel pretty unusable.
00:27:32.226 - 00:27:43.312, Speaker B: I think most people have to do transactions three to four times, and that's just like a pretty bad user experience. So between that or like $100, like, transaction fees on Ethereum, just pick your poison.
00:27:43.368 - 00:28:16.122, Speaker C: I guess the only thing that I think is worth noting is that just three years ago, pre 1559, Ethereum had similar issues, or at least a similar user experience, similar negative user experience. And instead of it taking like, whatever, a few seconds for your transaction to drop and not go through, it was like tens of minutes or ten minutes. So, you know, while it's not good, it's. It's a bad user experience. It's. We've all. Anyone who's been on chain for, you know, five plus years, this is something that will likely be solved in the future and get better.
00:28:16.122 - 00:28:26.934, Speaker C: And it's definitely not the worst we've dealt with. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that having these problems now feels so much better than the problems we had, you know, just in 2020, which wasn't even that long ago.
00:28:27.954 - 00:28:49.514, Speaker A: What still isn't clear to me, and I hope one of you guys has some clarification here, is how the ore mining actually plays into these problems. Because, like, from my understanding, is it's not the arbitrage bots that are causing the problem. It's. It's other stuff. And it's like, is ore mining really what ignited this? Or was it, is that not really that big of a part of the problem.
00:28:51.454 - 00:28:55.498, Speaker D: Should we maybe give some background on ore mining?
00:28:55.646 - 00:29:13.162, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So basically there's like a proof of work ripoff that's like an application on or a smart contract on Solana. And you can run this program to mine these ores. And there's like very little liquidity. There's only like one hundred k of liquidity. Actually, that was like a week ago when I looked. It's probably like half that now.
00:29:13.162 - 00:29:23.834, Speaker A: But regardless, you can mine these ores that have no real function. And apparently that's been contributing to Solana's problems. But I truly don't understand why.
00:29:26.774 - 00:30:19.014, Speaker D: I mean, this is all coming from Daniel, our great teammate, who tried to explain this to me one morning. So I'm probably paraphrasing and paraphrasing in a wrong way, but like he said that there's like a big incentive to just like spin out notes or trying to get as much compute through to the chain as possible, or through the smart contract, which like emits these ors when you solve the equation, basically. So what people are doing are they are, for example, hiring some like, professional RPC providers, I think, and then basically have them spam the smart contract on chain, which then I don't know how big the effect really is on the, like, bad experience, but apparently that could like bring about some problems.
00:30:19.794 - 00:30:46.434, Speaker B: I would have to imagine that these problems existed before, or, and I think, like, even before or like there were periods where Solana was like, slightly unusable. I don't think auror, like, contributed that much to what you're seeing right now, but it definitely, like, didn't help. And as far as like the RPC fund break, I just thinking like, on one hand, myrrt must be like crying at how unusable Solana is, but on the other hand, this guy must be printing off his, like, RPC business.
00:30:48.014 - 00:31:15.324, Speaker C: I think it's just congestion in general. So, like, I'm sure ore mining has some contributes a bit, but so does pump fund, so does meme coin trading, so does everything else going on Solana. And I think it's just back to like, Ren's point that, you know, basically there's this incentive to spam the network to get your transaction in. Like, if you have an opportunity to make, you know, $10, I don't even know how many Solana transactions you can spam to make that still worthwhile, but it's a shit ton. But yeah, I'm definitely not the most well read on the situation either.
00:31:16.224 - 00:31:33.124, Speaker D: Actually, that's an interesting point. You'd think it's like a snowballing effect where suddenly it gets a bit worse and then more people start spamming the chain. And then more people start spamming the chain. So they're like, experience gets worse and worse. Kind of a self fitting problem.
00:31:34.264 - 00:31:56.884, Speaker A: Yeah, the or problem would be more interesting if the price was going up because obviously that would contribute to that flywheel that you just mentioned. But I think Dan and Mert honestly would do this conversation ten x more justice. So we'll be sure to link to the, uh, the most recent lightspeed podcast, which I know they talked about this in depth, so we'll do that. But outside of that, Matt, why don't I kick it over to you for your hot seat or cool throw?
00:31:57.344 - 00:32:30.368, Speaker C: Yeah, so I don't even know who exactly to hold in the hot seat, so I'm just going to hold this entire situation in the hot seat. Uh, it's the Makerdao ave debacle. You might have seen some of it on Twitter. So for some contacts. So for some context, Makerdao put up a proposal to extend a credit line of 600 million to basically collateralize Dai with SUSD. So this is taking $600 million that doesn't exist in DAi purchasing s USD and receiving the yield that Athena USD receives. So, yeah, this is a big risk, the protocol.
00:32:30.368 - 00:33:03.648, Speaker C: But at the end of the day, it's a risk that pays off and that they think is a worthwhile risk. Directly after this Makerdao proposal Ave or Mark Zeller from Aave, who leads Aave Chan, put up a proposal to delist Dai as a collateral asset on AAve. So set the LTV to zero. You can't use Aave. You can't use Dai to take out loans on Aave anymore is the proposal that he put up. And it started a huge controversy. There are, you know, his Mark Zeller and backed by Stanis kind of say that the reason for this was risk optimization.
00:33:03.648 - 00:33:41.734, Speaker C: They think that dies risk when extremely. The, you know, the risk matrices on Dai changed completely in one day, so they want to get rid of it completely. Others are saying that, you know, setting a 0% LTV is a drastic measure and that it's basically just severing the relationship between maker die, maker Dao and Aave, which kind of makes sense given that they're starting to compete a little more and more these days. But overall, the whole situation is just a giant shit show. It's kind of setting a new equilibrium for governance across the board. And, yeah, it's just probably not a good look for the space overall as it decreases kind of the DeFi Lego composability value proposition that we love and enjoy.
00:33:43.674 - 00:34:40.529, Speaker B: I think historically, like Mercury Dow has been, I mean like it's always been like relatively back, but they've dabbled in Rwas a lot more. And you know, they've extended quote unquote like private credit lines to various like credit managers. So to say I don't think like Susan increases the risk of die being unbacked by that much, to be honest. And if anything like Susde quote unquote going wrong will be like a slow unwind rather than just one day like a borrower from a credit fund saying like, hey, I can't repay like this $50 million loan. So in that sense like I still think it's fine. And from Avi's perspective, obviously there are some sort of incentives that they have to aave has its own stable coin go, which I don't think has seen as much adoption as they would like. So it would make sense for them to, you know, deal this like a die market or like try to quote unquote like flood another like stable coin.
00:34:40.529 - 00:35:27.562, Speaker B: But yeah, would agree that like it is a shit show. And it brings up an interesting point, right? Like there are these like new crypto sash defi primitives that people have thought of. They've quickly found like product market fit and ground to like billions and billions of dollars of like TVL or like a um, or liquidity. And at the end of the day, the whole thing about crypto is sort of like Defi Legos, right? You get this vision of composability. But then now you have decentralized or quote unquote centralized like risk managers coming in and kind of like cutting out the composability component of crypto. And whether that should be allowed is a very good question. And the follow up question to that is like who should that sort of risk management lie on? You know, should it be on Athena? And they should be the ones actively going like, okay, like make it out, shit out.
00:35:27.562 - 00:35:43.034, Speaker B: Like let's only do like $300 million of die credit for SQSE or USDE or should that just be purely on Makerdao? And then obviously there's a whole bunch of second order effects to that with all of these protocols that are integrating all of these different tokens.
00:35:43.414 - 00:37:17.010, Speaker D: In my opinion it should definitely be a makerdao. I think why this has gotten so much attention within the maker community is because historically maker hasn't really made these or a similar sized bet before, especially on a mechanism that hasn't yet been proven in a. Like, a black swan event. And that's tough to model out because, yeah, you're basically just assuming, like, certain probabilities for the black swan event, and then based on that, you get some EV calculation and then decide to do it or not. So I know some community members weren't too happy about, like, yeah, this is a great opportunity for maker to print a lot of cash, because basically, the last time I checked, I think maker was earning 80% ap wise for, like, the dai borrowed out, which is amazing if you have, like, 500 or a billion there. So I do see the temptation to expand quickly and kind of take advantage of these high funding rates we have right now. But then again, on the other side, like, if something will, or if something happens to go wrong connected to Athena, I feel that it's going to be like, a super quick unwinding or, like, an event that you basically, you either lose everything or almost everything, or then you survive.
00:37:17.010 - 00:37:28.214, Speaker D: So it's tough situation to be in and. Yeah, interesting decision to go ahead with such a large, like, I don't know, decision.
00:37:30.994 - 00:37:51.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm all for it. I think while funding rates are positive, like, go for it, and then you can change parameters down the line if you need to. But I'm also, like, a USD bull. I think democratizing that trade is. Is a really cool idea and a new primitive that we haven't seen. And I'm all for it. But maybe that's just because Ren and I spoke with guy just this morning for an interview episode.
00:37:51.950 - 00:37:54.126, Speaker A: So. Recency bias?
00:37:54.310 - 00:38:54.434, Speaker D: No, I mean, I do see the vision, and I think it's a great project. It's just that, as always with stable coins, like, the worst thing is when the market loses confidence in the protocol or whatever stablecoin you have, because usually it's also quite irrational. Like what happened with USDC, where the peg was trading below the confirmed collateral value that the bank still had beginning of last year, I think. And a similar situation could go down with Dai. And you also have this game theoretical situation where, like, you're incentivized to front run all of your capital out of the project to be the first one to, like, not take a haircut, and then the people who are slower are gonna be the ones that are basically left holding the bags. And maybe, to clarify, after having said all of the. It's.
00:38:54.434 - 00:39:05.854, Speaker D: I'm not saying anything of this is gonna happen. I'm just, like, trying to paint a picture of what maybe the worst situation that could happen would be here.
00:39:07.154 - 00:39:37.834, Speaker C: Athena's definitely got lots of risks. There's the risk that steeth deeps. There's the risk that copper clear loop has four hour settlement. So even if one of the exchanges goes down, they'll have directional exposure for a four hour period of time. Binance doesn't actually use copper clear loop, so if Binance goes down. But at that point, there's a lot more to worry about than just Athena. There's the risk that whoever controls the ability to access the custody with copper clear loop actually just takes the money out.
00:39:37.834 - 00:40:11.550, Speaker C: There's no contractual obligations that could happen. A quote unquote rug. I don't think that it's at all likely, but it's a possibility. There's all these risks to consider, but I do actually think that, at least from my perspective, and in my opinion, those risks are outweighed by the current reward that Athena's paying out, at least for me and only for me not speaking for other people. So maybe Makerdao made a similar decision and, you know, decided that $600 million was an appropriate risk to take on, given the expected value of their payoff from this position. So, overall, like, I'm for it, too. I think it's a risk, but it's a.
00:40:11.550 - 00:40:14.234, Speaker C: It's a well thought through risk.
00:40:16.294 - 00:40:52.218, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought it was interesting. That guy told us today, like, he wouldn't be opposed to moving some of the short legs on the ETH trade into stables, given the opportunity. And, like, the risk management deems that at a certain time, like, I just think that there's a lot more things they can do to protect against these risks than people are giving them credit for. And I also think, like, they're diversifying their, you know, their exchanges, their custody providers, like, all of that different stuff. So, like, worst case scenario, in my view, isn't, like, really the risk of negative funding. It's. It's actually, like, the risk of, yeah, centralized exchange going insolvent and not getting paid out on the short leg.
00:40:52.218 - 00:41:19.714, Speaker A: But even then, if you've only got 20% of your open interest on one exchange, then you're taking, like, what, 20% of the, you know, 50% of the hedge? And then that's only that it just ends up being a very small amount. So I don't think this is a scenario like, ust where all of a sudden you wake up one morning and your life savings is gone. I think it's going to be at worst like ten to 20% haircut. But ill probably eat those words in a bear market. So trade carefully.
00:41:20.814 - 00:41:43.462, Speaker D: No, but as I said earlier, theres still the possibility that everybody starts panicking and then the situation becomes worse than it otherwise would. One question I had, and I dont know if you want to save this for the other podcast episode, but did you talk at all about the insurance fund? Whats the situation with that? Has it been growing like through which ways?
00:41:43.638 - 00:42:05.550, Speaker A: Yeah, it's gotten really big actually. So they're adding about $6 billion a week as of April 2. It's up to 33 million from the starting point of 2 million. I believe 10 million of that was added through the recent raise that they had. But I think 20 to 25 million is organic, just growth. And I believe that that revenue. I actually didn't ask this directly because it was one of my questions.
00:42:05.550 - 00:42:55.780, Speaker A: I wasn't sure where the accrual actually came from, but it sounded like SUsde stakers get their pro rata share dependent upon how much of the USD supply is staked, and the remainder. So the USDE that's just sitting in EOAs, that isn't staked in Us s USDE, that excess goes to the insurance fund. So yes, at 30, 40, 50, 60% funding rates, they are absolutely printing on that insurance fund. I will note that the original studies done by, I believe it was gauntlet or chaos. I can't recall which entity, but they recommended $30 million of capital in the insurance fund for every $1 billion of USD supply. And obviously USD has about 2 billion of supply and only 33 million in the insurance fund. So right now that actually is below the targeted threshold that was done by a third party.
00:42:55.780 - 00:43:34.714, Speaker A: But the internal testing that was done by the Athena team suggested more like 15 million for every 1 billion of USD supply. So it depends on which source you want to go on. Uh, I think probably taking the more conservative of the two is the better approach. But nonetheless, like at this run rate, like they're going to be at 60 million for their 2 billion USD in just a couple weeks. And I mean, at that point though, it's a game of catch up because I'm sure the USD supplies on a fast track to 5 billion, given that their SaaS campaign is KPI based and time duration based. So it's either first to 5 billion USD supply or in six months, whichever comes first. And if it's anything like the first campaign, then it will be a lot sooner than six months.
00:43:38.534 - 00:44:04.368, Speaker B: All right, I think that's a good point to throw it over to my hot seat couture. Similar on sort of like the private credit side of things. I have Goldfinch in the hot seat. So there was another default on Goldfinch last week, this time from a company called Lend east. They just reviewed that they can only repay 4.25 million out of their 10.15 million loan from the Goldfinch pool.
00:44:04.368 - 00:44:26.412, Speaker B: So that represents roughly a 58% loss on that specific loan. And it represents 7.7% of active loans on Goldfinch. According to sort of community members. Within the discord, 750,000 borrowed from Goldfinch was used by lend east to repay other borrowers, obviously in breach of the loan agreement. You can't really do that. That's a big no no.
00:44:26.412 - 00:45:00.474, Speaker B: And yeah, it was like a 10.15 million loan with a 25 month term paying out a 17% rate. And yeah, I think, like, this is probably the third default that Goldfinch has experienced previously. They had a default from Tugunde, one from Stratos, and a few, like, armor vesps added together is probably around like 20 million or so. So Goldfinch is in pretty rough shape. And all of these private credit protocols have just been continued to be battered, like, ever since. Sort of like the Luna three AC FTX fallout.
00:45:00.474 - 00:45:58.120, Speaker B: And if you would remember, there were like a huge amount of crypto market makers that blew up and weren't able to repay their private credit loans from protocols such as like, maple finance. And it just seems like that fallout continues, though, even outside of crypto borrowers. Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution here is. Obviously, like, underwriting jungle bonds, especially in emerging markets, is pretty hard and defaults are unavoidable. Like, it'll be hard to run a private credit fund with like a 0% default rate. But obviously you're hoping that the return from your lending overcomes, like, whatever default that occurs. And so I don't think, like, maybe there's a bit of an adverse selection problem given that a lot of their loans were in emerging countries and this sort of like, sort of like, growth mode, companies that were doing like bike sharing or whatever.
00:45:58.120 - 00:46:36.444, Speaker B: So that definitely, like, doesn't help. But it's also not like whoever was, like, underwriting these loans were not professionals. You know, they had like professional, like, credit fund managers, like, managing these loans during the underwriting. But yeah, at the end of the day, there's always going to be like, a lack of accountability. Like, I underwrote those loans. But, like, you know, if something defaults like, it's not really my problem. And similar thing from, like, a borrower, you know, like, if I'm like, a random, like, sharing company in Ethiopia and I default, like, yeah, like, goldfinch was probably like my last lifeline and, like, by default, then so be it, you know? So, yeah, that's just another thing on the Goldfinch and, like, private credit side of things.
00:46:36.444 - 00:46:43.184, Speaker B: But would love to hear if anyone has any thoughts on how we fix this, to be honest. Or, like, if private credit on chain should even exist.
00:46:45.284 - 00:47:29.090, Speaker D: I think it makes a lot of sense to have private credit on chain just because of all of the efficiencies you can rich and all of that good stuff. Like, I think we've talked about it quite a few times, but to me, it's just interesting. Like, if you look at private credit funds, just like, in the tradfi world, I'm. I'm not sure, but my, if I recall correctly, I think they produce around like 15, 20% yields. Default rates are probably below, like 5% of the AUM, which even at that point, like, somehow sounds super hard to me or high to me. And, like, compared to this goldfinch situation, which. What did you say? Like, 20% of the Aum is now under default.
00:47:29.090 - 00:48:33.982, Speaker D: That's brutal because, like, you kind of assume, yeah, you know, that private credit, and especially emerging markets, are a tough business and, like, riskier than, you know, buying aaa bonds, but still, like, you basically taken on more volatility than investing into equities, and your returns aren't even close on par with that. So I'm guessing if these news spread out more, it's going to be hard for some of these debt protocols to attract capital, especially in a bull market like this, when we just talked about Etina. But that feels like pretty close to a zero risk, or I guess not zero risk, but much closer to, like, a zero risk situation than, like, investing into this super, super risky, or I guess not super, super risky, but still risky like that. Instruments in emerging markets, credit markets, has.
00:48:33.998 - 00:49:09.680, Speaker C: Always been the same thing, which is, a, assessing creditworthiness and b, default recourse. So when we, like Maple finance, when it was going through its, uh, its whole thing back in the three ac blow up days, it had a ton of defaults. I forgot the exact percentage, but it was even more than 20% of Aum. Um, maybe closer to 50. Their only loan recourse was reputational hit. And in a world where, you know, three AC was blowing up, uh, reputational hit was not good recourse if I remember correctly, and forgive me if I'm wrong, I haven't looked into golf inch in over a year, but, uh, they actually have contractual obligation and loan recourse. So I'm curious to see how that actually plays out.
00:49:09.680 - 00:49:35.340, Speaker C: Um, and who would go and sue the defaulting borrower? And additionally, like, yeah, it's a. You know, this is a ridiculously hard space to solve, uh, if we manage to get on chain credit to truly work, whether it be through digital identities. Um, you know, I've always had this idea that it's some sort of, like, ZK. So basically your identity. Your identity and your. Maybe it's, like, connected to plaid. So your net worth and all your different assets are tied up into a ZK proof.
00:49:35.340 - 00:50:09.784, Speaker C: And then if you default, it's kind of unraveled to the lender so that they can actually come after you and there's contractual obligations there. So do you think one day we get these on chain credit markets to work and it will be what makes, you know, in my opinion, the next step for Defi? Like, brings defi back into the narrative, but the solutions we have today just are not there. Um, and from a team like Goldfinch, who seems to have transitioned a lot of their bandwidth and brainpower kind of into other initiatives of late, so they launched this, like, AI advisor or something. Um, it'll be interesting to see how the situation plays out, but overall, I'm. I'm hopeful. It's a good team. I I wish them the best.
00:50:11.004 - 00:50:45.898, Speaker A: I just can't believe that interest rate. You said 17%, Ren. So you're telling me I can buy USD and stake it and earn three times the amount as doing an under collateralized loan? As a lender in an emerging market, like, that is, you're on crack. Like, under collateralized lending on chain is a great business for borrowers and borrowers only. Like, you're insane to be lending on those things. I'm sorry. I think it's a terrible idea until, like, that's on a private blockchain and, like, actual, like, people who have spent entire careers in under collateralized lending and credit assessment.
00:50:45.898 - 00:50:53.494, Speaker A: Like, that's when it makes sense. And you can Kyc, and there's actual default recourse. But otherwise, like, that's a no for me, dog.
00:50:54.114 - 00:51:21.082, Speaker B: Yeah, now that you put it that way and make that comparison, it is pretty crazy. I mean, technically, Goldfinch tells that all of its loans are, like, over collateralized. And they say, like, they do a bunch of due diligence. Like, it's collateralized by, like, balance sheets, like, cash flows and whatever. But, yeah, I mean, like, it's still kind of under collateralized at the end of the day. And if you're going to make three times that on Athena, which is, like, quote unquote, like, real yield, then that seems like a lot better risk reward.
00:51:21.258 - 00:51:37.272, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll add that I don't know anything about Goldfinch for the most part, and I do commend them for, like, trying it because it is needed. Like, DeFi is fundamentally constrained until we have under collateralized lending. But, like, today, like, yeah, no, you.
00:51:37.288 - 00:51:41.644, Speaker C: Just put that so simply and eloquently, like, yeah, hard. Agree.
00:51:44.024 - 00:52:27.240, Speaker B: Yeah. I think one more thing that I just like to put on the coastal this weekend has been making waves on CT is pump fun. So, pump fun is a website that allows you to launch a shitcoin on both Solana and blast. And basically how it works is that you deploy a coin, you add, like, a ticker your image, whatever, and people can buy it on pump fun. And once it reaches 69,000 in market cap on Solana, it deploys $12,000 of liquidity into a radium pool. And basically, as you can imagine, like, thousands and thousands of tokens are getting launched there every single day. And every time a token hits the radium pools, pump dot fund takes a two so fixed migration fee.
00:52:27.240 - 00:53:13.744, Speaker B: So at current prices, that's probably, like around $400. And pump dot fund is making $350,000 a day. And if you sort of annualize that, that's 100 million in annualized revenue, which is, like, pretty. Pretty crazy, to be honest. And, like, on the other side of the equation, like Dex greener, they charge, like, $299 for an ad on, like, sort of, like, the right side, where you see, like, the price, the market cap. And, like, that ad space is always filled up. So I think, obviously, the main takeaway, at least for me, is that picks and shovels are absolutely eating, especially, like, meme coin picks and shovels, which makes me think that, like, telegram bots will probably have today again this cycle, given that they've been, like, pretty battered, to be honest, over the past few months.
00:53:13.744 - 00:53:23.754, Speaker B: But it's just crazy seeing, like, such a simple business makes so much money. And, like, it's something that's, like, super unique about crypto. And these guys are, like a three person team.
00:53:24.814 - 00:53:32.830, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean that. So wait, you're saying for deck screener, when somebody links the socials to the coin, they charge $300?
00:53:33.022 - 00:53:46.184, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's one component, like, when someone wants to link socials, they charge $300. And then there's also, like, ad space, which they sell on the sidebar. And that's probably, like another, like, completely guessing you, but probably like another few hundred bucks.
00:53:47.124 - 00:54:16.884, Speaker D: That has to be such a good business model because, yeah, basically every coin you look at always has those socials there, and that's so scalable. Or, like, you basically don't have to do anything anymore. You just like, you've completed your platform and now you chill and enjoy the bull market. Yeah, I think maybe it doesn't make it send us for these platforms to launch a token themselves, but, like, shout out to the team for creating this stuff.
00:54:17.184 - 00:54:57.012, Speaker C: Pump fun has a real opportunity. Like, in its current state, it could definitely be like a temporary time in the spotlight. But overall, it's a simple idea, right? I'm not sure if Ren mentioned it, but the LP gets locked. So you basically are buying into this. You're buying into this liquidity curve with Sol, you're buying this meme coin, and then eventually a large portion of the soul that gets put into the liquidity curve gets put into radium, and then that LP token is burned so it's no longer accessible. So it helps with these fair launches. It removes your risk of, in the traditional sense, getting rugged, where you take out all the liquidity from the pool.
00:54:57.012 - 00:55:26.628, Speaker C: You can still get rugged otherwise, but the traditional rugged liquidity sense. So it's like a great idea from my perspective. The actual platform is, you know, has a lot of room for improvement. But that said, like, if it goes and launches across all these different chains, right now it's only live on Solana and blast, but you could easily go see it live on base and arbitrum and everywhere else in the near future. There's no reason it shouldn't be live there. Besides, obviously, instead of using radium, it'd be using uniswap or whatever. So I think that pump fun actually has, like, the legs to be a.
00:55:26.628 - 00:55:36.364, Speaker C: A real, like you said, pick and shovel or infrastructure product in crypto. And I definitely kind of hope to see it continue iterating and growing and being better.
00:55:36.904 - 00:56:06.724, Speaker B: Here's a question for you all. If you were one of the three co founders of Pumpdot Fund, you're making $100 million in annualized revenue today. So that's probably like $33 million each. And chances are this meme coin craziness continues for at least a few more months, if not until the end of the year, or it gets even crazier. From her. Would you launch a token or. No, you launch a token and I don't know, like 80% of your revenue has to like go back to like token holders, just like some fee switch.
00:56:06.724 - 00:56:22.414, Speaker B: You have to manage the DaO. Like just push back. Now you have like community only like part of the protocol, whereas like, if you don't launch a token, sure, you don't get like whatever money you can cash off the token, but you're making like $33 million each. And I just cold hard cash.
00:56:24.234 - 00:56:43.978, Speaker A: If I were them, I would be doing absolutely everything I can to further decentralize the actual product because you are literally enabling the launching of, of, you know, chitcoins. Like, yeah, I would want to distance myself from that personally and I wouldn't want to just be pocketing revenue into perpetuity, but that's just my take.
00:56:44.146 - 00:57:15.414, Speaker C: Sam wanted to say a two word phrase that can't be said on this show so bad. Oh, my gosh. Uh, yeah, there's a lot of liability with launching tokens, but I think more so if I go launch a pump fund competitor today and I shove a points, I like just a point system on the top right corner, so that if you launch a coin, you get ten points, or you launch a coin that successfully hits radium, you get ten points. You buy into a coin with more than one soul, you get one point, they will get vampire attacked in eight. So I do think that actually to stay competitive, they probably need to have some sort of token or incentive mechanism for users at some point.
00:57:15.874 - 00:57:26.524, Speaker D: Okay, another interesting question would be, does anybody know if there's really like, being a token that's been launched on pump that fun, and then it's become like huge.
00:57:27.584 - 00:57:48.784, Speaker B: I think Ansem's cat hob or whatever, it was like a pumpkin fun launch, and then there's this tweet I saw. I don't know if it was true or not, but, like, some guy launched like 183 different tokens and he's made like 650k so far. So, yeah, I do think there's like been a few, like, big ones. Like, not like with level big, but like relatively big tokens that have been launched on pump fund.
00:57:49.564 - 00:58:12.624, Speaker C: I'm taking a look right now. It looks like Shark Cat is the most popular at. Not sure the exact, not sure the exact market cap, but maybe 140 million or so, followed by Ansem's cat Hobbs at 50 million, followed by one in tarnation wit at 22 million. So short answer. No, but like, those are substantial numbers.
00:58:13.274 - 00:58:33.506, Speaker A: All right, well, I think that's a good place to stop it. I know we all have an eclipse to go watch, other than Brick, who is fading the. The coolness of the eclipse, which is insanity to me, but you guys can get after him on that in the comments if you disagree as well. But thank you guys so much for coming on. We will see you here next week, and, yeah, thank you. Bye.
