00:00:00.170 - 00:00:34.166, Speaker A: I see this, like, growing acceptance that the escape hatch, or being able to force include your transactions and account to the l one, make it okay to be a centralized sequencer. And I think that is bullshit. And I think it's bullshit for two reasons. One, because I would never be able to figure that out. My stuff would be gone. I'd be the last out. I think realistically, what's going to happen is the big guys, the hedge funds, the exchanges, all the elite players that are actually very tech savvy will understand how to do it.
00:00:34.166 - 00:00:41.530, Speaker A: They'll migrate their assets. And then me, my little minnow, I'm going to be caught up there. I'm going to hold onto the boat, and I'm just going to be laid out to dry.
00:00:44.030 - 00:01:32.146, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research, brought to you by the Atom accelerator. If you're a developer looking for a home in the industry, the atom Economic zone welcomes you. You'll hear more about the atom accelerator a little bit later in the show, but today is July 24, and we are switching things up, doing an ECC recap, and we're joined by Mike and Matt. We were lucky enough to be in Paris last week, spent a little bit of time over there, and it was honestly a very refreshing thing to go do. The vibes in the conference were a lot better than I think a lot of us expected. But before we jump into that, we did want to take a second to shout out our own conference, permissionless two, which is the world's largest DFI and crypto native conference, bringing builders, researchers, investors, and thought leaders all into one place in the heart of Austin, Texas. You can use code zero x 30 for a 30% discount.
00:01:32.146 - 00:01:44.218, Speaker B: And if you do end up coming, be sure to hit us up on Twitter or on Telegram so we can go and grab a beer. But, yeah, I think this would be a good time to just kind of start. What did you guys think the overall vibes were at ECC in Paris?
00:01:44.314 - 00:02:24.726, Speaker C: Yeah, like you mentioned, I was pretty surprised that the vibes were positive. When you spend all day on crypto Twitter, know, in the depths of random protocols docs, things can get a little bleak at times. But I just want to echo the sentiment that that doesn't seem to be the case with the people that you actually want to be in a positive mood. Right, the builders. And that was very much so. How I viewed the average participant of this conference, not a lot of tourists. Nine out of the ten people you talked to were very high signal who are building a meaningful part of the crypto ecosystem.
00:02:24.726 - 00:02:36.606, Speaker C: It was really cool, really refreshing. Everyone was just excited about things, which feels like a huge sentiment shift from the last six to twelve months. Honestly, I would echo that.
00:02:36.628 - 00:02:58.566, Speaker A: There's just such a discrepancy in between Twitter, which I got to actually put my hand up. I still don't even know what the hamster joke was. I just completely missed that on my feed. But now my whole feed is referencing hamsters and I don't even know what people are talking about. But there is that going on on Twitter. And then there was the reality of what happened in Paris this last week. And I just want to add, we've been hosting conferences for a long time.
00:02:58.566 - 00:03:30.302, Speaker A: I've been to plenty of bull market and bear market conferences. This was a large outlier in terms of usually 18 months into a bear market. You're like deep into apathy. Conference attendance and excitement tends to be a lagging indicator in crypto. So, like, by way of example, I remember consensus in 2018, like six months after the bull market let off and people were still like, yeah, might still be a bull market. And then the year after attendance dropped 90%, it went from like 10,000 people to 1000. And it was really.
00:03:30.302 - 00:03:49.238, Speaker A: You were just in the doldrum. So that was my mental framework going into this conference, and it just could not have been further from the truth. It was like more people, more excitement, solving real problems then, yeah, that's just very abnormal for this space. And I just think it bodes extremely well for the current moment in time.
00:03:49.324 - 00:03:58.630, Speaker C: The right curve was in Paris, the left curve was racing hamsters on crypto, Twitter, and the middle curve has just given up. They're not here anymore.
00:03:59.370 - 00:04:38.178, Speaker D: Full agree on that. Everyone there was looking at the right know as account abstraction, Mev looking at infra, how do we support the next billion users on chain? And it was really refreshing having so much excitement around that. I heard the attendance at the conference was double what it was the year before. So I thought that was kind of surprising and fun fact. And overall, I was really surprised by how much also money was being spent. I don't know if that was surprising to any of you guys, but there's a lot of parties, a lot of events, a lot of great conferences, a lot of money being spent. So I thought that overall, even though the emotions and sentiment in the industry is so low, it isn't being reflected in reality, at least in Paris last week.
00:04:38.264 - 00:05:22.722, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good call out, Matt. I also thought just the collaboration between the different factions of people was kind of interesting. Dan and I had the pleasure of hosting the ZK unconference that Matterlabs helped put together the team behind Zksync. And it was just kind of wild seeing Jordy from Polygon and then Alex from ZK sync and other people from cross chain interop protocols using ZK to actually just sit in a room, not talk shit about each other's protocols like they do on Twitter, and instead be like, how do we make this work? How do we actually make it so our ecosystem of l two s and l three s can actually interoperate with your ecosystem and l two s and l three s without it being like a one token wins all scenario. So I thought that was super cool to see live in person go down.
00:05:22.776 - 00:06:20.998, Speaker C: Yeah, that's interesting as well. And I think one of the interesting takeaways that I don't know how I feel about this yet, but everybody there was building infrastructure. Literally nobody was building an application on top of that infrastructure. And part of me is, I guess the optimist in me is like, okay, good, because the current infrastructure can't even support true usage, right? If a billion people we're looking for want to come use an application on chains, it's just not going to work. We do need to keep building this out, but it would also be nice if we were luring some more people into our industry and building things people actually want to use and not just forking another perp decks and putting some more degen assets on there. There's definitely a long list of things that could be getting built. That crowd wasn't necessarily there, so I'm a bit torn on that, but I'm curious if you guys can relieve me of my pain in any way.
00:06:21.084 - 00:06:22.182, Speaker B: I can't relieve you.
00:06:22.236 - 00:06:49.166, Speaker A: I had the same takeaway there, and I could put my cynical hat on and give you an answer for why I think that is. But then, like a more realistic, sort of maybe empathetic hat, but cynical hat know, would know. Infra is very hard to value, right? So you need a token always in infra, and it's very hard to value. So it's a pretty good thing to build. You can pretty much just point to the tam and say, look at how big this damn tam is. Launch a token. And that's pretty good.
00:06:49.166 - 00:07:46.714, Speaker A: The actual empathetic hat, Mike, is to say, there is a bit of a real chicken and egg problem when it comes to apps and the infrastructure that they're built on. And this isn't like wildly unlike other tech cycles where info gets built and then there's a lag of like six to 18 months where it takes apps like a while to figure out how to build on that. But the chicken and egg problem being in order to have good apps, you need good infrastructure to support those apps. But also, at the same time, we don't know what these apps are going to look like yet. And really, the infrastructure should support the needs of the application. So there needs to be this virtuous feedback cycle that just hasn't kicked in in between the development of apps and infrastructure. And I think a couple of the interesting solutions that you're starting to see crop up is actually teams building an app at the same time that they're building kind of like an SDK supporting set of infrastructure.
00:07:46.714 - 00:08:26.046, Speaker A: So I would actually point to on the gaming side of this, Scott Sonardo at Argus Labs actually developed a game called Dark forest, but they're also building a supporting roll up SDK for gaming, which is pretty interesting. And actually most of the l two s are kind of doing this too, like ZK sync or optimism. They all have their stacks along with one sort of general purpose, like ZK era. And then there's also the ZK stack, and there's sort of a broader framework with different modular components that you can plug in to build in their ecosystem. So I thought that was actually the closest thing that we saw to kind of exciting apps getting built. But yeah, that's kind of my opinion on it.
00:08:26.068 - 00:08:57.826, Speaker B: It was also a little bit sobering just to hear some of the problems these zkvms have live. They're nothing like safety critical problems. But I don't want to call anyone out here, but there's reasons some of the major blue chip d five protocols aren't actually over there yet, despite having already signaled support to go over there yet. So these things take time, and I think we're just heads down building in a bear market right now. And that was very much the vibe, and everyone's just trying to fix them. So that way when next cycle comes, we can actually launch all these dapps.
00:08:57.858 - 00:10:04.090, Speaker C: So ZK sync is working to fix one problem with era. So when you post a block, and there's a timestamp usually associated with that block, and this allows things like, say, token incentives, because if you give token incentives on a prorata basis to lps in a pool, for example, you need to know how long the lps were in the pool in order to actually have them accrue the proper amount of rewards. And so with most l two s, the timestamp that you call when you're on the l two will return the l two s timestamp, meaning l two s generally have faster blocks, so they need to have the appropriate time for each block. Well, in the case of DK sync, when you call the l two timestamp, it actually returns the l one timestamp, meaning the last time a proof has been posted to the l one. So therefore, there's like a 20 minutes gap in between, or like a couple of minute gap in between actually getting a new l two timestamp. And this is like a critical issue for getting, as Sam mentioned, like these large d five protocols on chain. And so I think it's like an interesting problem to kind of see one of these ecosystems have.
00:10:04.090 - 00:10:38.402, Speaker C: But again, they know that there was going to be like, they know it's a problem. They're building out a solution for it. I honestly think this just had to do with, like, there was a huge race to get to production between a lot of the largest players. And this kind of feels like one of the things that I was like, okay, well, yes, we made it there on time, but we still have some things we need to build out. And so I think there's just some dev tooling, things that really need to get built out around not only just like ZK sync, but zke evms more broadly. When you have this new infrastructure, again, you need to keep building out the tooling. So it's like step one, build the infrastructure.
00:10:38.402 - 00:10:46.058, Speaker C: Step two, build the dev tooling, and then step three, build the applications that people actually use. And it feels like we're in between step one and two right now.
00:10:46.144 - 00:10:50.070, Speaker A: How often do proofs get submitted to l one for most of these chains?
00:10:50.230 - 00:11:21.250, Speaker C: That's a good question. I think it's like a matter of minutes right now, just because at least with Boojim and speaking specifically towards ZK sync, they've really optimized their approver. That's something they spent a lot of time doing. Right now, boojim is running in like, I think they call it shadow mode, basically. So it's like running in the background, not affect. It's sort of like a testnet in some way. And so it's going to be a matter of minutes at scale, which is pretty in contrast to optimistic l two s, where more transactions can be more expensive.
00:11:21.250 - 00:11:35.210, Speaker C: It's like more transactions will actually mean that proofs get posted more often, because you kind of need to hit that threshold where it becomes affordable to kind of dissect the cost amongst the active participants in that specific proof.
00:11:35.710 - 00:12:12.694, Speaker D: Something I thought was interesting was I went to Arbitrum day, and I agree with you. I met very few builders the entire time that I was in Paris. Literally, I think, outside of arbitram day, I met maybe two or three in total. And there I actually met people building the gaming space, d five space. None of these were ideas that I would say are particularly innovative or maybe going to bring a ton of people who aren't currently on chain on chain, kind of no catalysts, nothing like that. But at the same time, there is way more building going on on arbitrum than on any of these other l two s. And it's interesting that I hear so often from, for lack of better words like gigabrain, crypto people, that ZK roll ups are the way to go.
00:12:12.694 - 00:12:41.214, Speaker D: I've even heard a few times people say, like, the optimism stack is that optimism is better place for devs to build than on arbitrum. But at the same time, arbitrum has this huge dev community and it's growing and it's like, well, you can build this great ZK roll up in theory, but if you're not attracting all these devs to come build there, is that where it's going to settle? And that's something that I definitely have been thinking a lot about. Do I care more about the tech stack? Is that long term a better bet? Or am I going to focus on arbitrum, where today devs are actually building?
00:12:41.332 - 00:12:50.882, Speaker C: See, for me this goes, and to clarify in the last comment, I'm not shitting on ZK sync. I'm actually the most personally bullish on the ZK stack as a whole.
00:12:51.016 - 00:12:53.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I got pilled pretty hard on that, actually. This.
00:12:55.430 - 00:13:35.040, Speaker C: So like. But I was wondering when I saw the ZK stack stack announcement, we talked to Alex and Anthony a couple of weeks ago on the podcast. I was like, well, why is nobody? And like, Sam and I finally discovered that answer of like, it's this timestamp issue. And it's like, okay, that's like a small trivial problem that will be fixed. And then we'll see these large applications get over there. Then you'll see. Start to see, like, okay, does this actually scale? Does this actually make sense? The question then becomes, what does the future look like? Is it more of this app chain thesis where you have hyperchains plugged in as l three s on top of Zk sync air or some other chain? Or you have some more centralized validium type solution using a Zk porter that they offer.
00:13:35.040 - 00:14:02.778, Speaker C: We don't really know yet, because one of the questions I am still trying to dig into the answer to is who is going to build these l two s or these l three s that have these custom solutions? Is it going to be a large payment processor, like a visa Mastercard, or like a stripe or someone of that nature? Or is it going to be still someone more crypto native, focused, like somebody who wants a more customized decks or something like that, for example? And that is still very much an open question in my mind.
00:14:02.864 - 00:14:43.938, Speaker A: Yeah. Some thoughts on just interoperability. One key takeaway for me. I'd be curious if you guys agree with this idea or not, but I thought this was sort of a bullish and bearish conference in terms of interoperability. Like bullish in the sense that I think interoperability is going to be solved on the l two layer between different app chains within one sort of platform. But I don't see there being a lot of interoperability between different big roll ups or layer two. So, like, for instance, these sort of hyperchains, I feel like they'll solve the interoperability problem within sort of the Zk sync stack or the Zk stack.
00:14:43.938 - 00:15:32.406, Speaker A: So all of those app chains that the Zk stack supports will be interoperable. But I think an app chain that exists on ZK, like using the ZK stack, will not be super interoperable between an app chain on the op stack. And my thought process is that the most likely outcome is going to be like two or three big winners. And there are a whole bunch of reasons why I think that's actually the case. But I sort of see like two or three big winners of these sort of layer two ecosystems where all these things are interoperable. And then there's kind of shitty longer term interoperability where there's some kind of, like, you can get these two things to talk over, like a longer, more expensive time frame, but won't be good for day to day sorts of interactions. So that's how I sort of see it playing out.
00:15:32.406 - 00:15:33.942, Speaker A: I'd be curious what you guys think about that.
00:15:33.996 - 00:16:14.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that ultimately we're going to all be ZK roll ups, to be honest. And I think that there's going to be a certain design that everyone kind of converges on, and I really do think it's going to converge on one design. I don't know what it looks like. It's really hard to guess the timing, but I do think that's ultimately what's going to happen. So that way this composability across every ecosystem is kind of like within one hood in one tech stack. And I guess just another takeaway on the same vein of optimistic versus ZK is just. I'm convinced these optimistic chains are going for adoption first, like arbitram and optimism, and then they're just going to implement ZK stuff as it gets further developed.
00:16:14.510 - 00:16:39.594, Speaker B: They want those network effects, they want those developers and builders to come over there and get the users. It's just such a good game plan. It makes the most sense. And I even saw, I think it was optimism the other day, awarded two rfqs for ZK interoperability. I think one was to risk zero, who actually was at the young conference that Dan and I moderated in Paris, and then can't remember who the other one was. But nonetheless, it's just kind of a testament to the.
00:16:39.792 - 00:17:08.534, Speaker C: I think we really forget how important bd is in this. We. We just made this amazing thing that will change the world, but we're not going to tell anyone about it because they're just going to find it, because we're the best. That seems to be like this idea that a lot of dev teams have, and it's like you got to tell people you have a product or else you got to distribute, and people forget that. I don't know. But, yeah, Mike, I definitely agree with you. I got a good new crypto vocab word for you.
00:17:08.534 - 00:17:21.114, Speaker C: So these ecosystems of l two s will be constellations. So you'll have, like, ZK syncs, constellation Polygons, Constellation maybe scrolls, Constellation. And you're right, you won't have that.
00:17:21.152 - 00:17:23.946, Speaker A: Constellation sounds a lot better than wall garden, doesn't it?
00:17:24.048 - 00:18:03.826, Speaker C: It does. And this probably goes back to what I was just saying, like, distribution. Maybe that was where their pitfall was, and they built this great tech, but couldn't get it in the hands of people. I think wallets have a lot to do with that. I'm almost positive we'll get into that later in the show. So the idea of how to get interop between Constellations actually came up at the Zkon conference, and they're like, okay, if we were going to do this, what would it look like? And basically, interop is enabled within a single constellation. So say the ZK stack hyperbridges exist because of the shared bridge contract, the contract that's actually on the l one, that holds the assets and a shared prover.
00:18:03.826 - 00:18:32.122, Speaker C: And so if you have those two things. So you're using the same ZK circuits and have all the assets in the same contract. That gives you this interop. Like, you can blindly trust hyperchain a and hyperchain B because they're built using the same tech stack. But you can't have that between, say, polygon Zke EVM and ZK sync arrow. Let's say if I was trying to bridge between the two, they're different circuits, so I can't just blindly trust them. And we're using a different l one bridge contract.
00:18:32.122 - 00:18:58.518, Speaker C: The assets aren't actually in the same contract. So to get around this, let's say, a couple of years out from now, Polygon, Zke EVM and Zksync era both have insane provers. Their circuits are great. There's no reason not to trust them. They're simply built in two different models. Well, then, at that point, maybe the ZK sync community and the polygon community can be like, okay, we both have great tech. I don't want to switch to yours because I like mine and vice versa.
00:18:58.518 - 00:19:34.942, Speaker C: But we do have, like, I trust your system. That can happen. But you still wouldn't be able to have the actual bridging take place, because the assets are in different contracts on the l one. So the only way to make this possible would basically be the ZK sync Zkstack constellation and the Polygon constellation combining assets within the same shared contract. But this opens up, like, this whole can of worms of. Okay, now our assets are together, so we're basically, like, commingled here. So your governance can't mess with my assets.
00:19:34.942 - 00:20:15.278, Speaker C: And I'm sure your governance doesn't want to mess with my assets, either. There's this huge thing. So, basically, this is kind of like, one of the themes of the conference was, like, that would need to be enshrined and basically ungovernable. And you'd basically just have to have this Zke EVM shared liquidity bridge contract that holds all these assets that get blasted out to these Zke EVM constellations. And you'd have to trust all the circuits there. It gets in this whole messy thing really quickly. And then who gets to plug into this? How do they determine who gets to plug into this? If you don't get in this cartel, then your EVM doesn't have, or your ZK stack constellation doesn't have interop with.
00:20:15.278 - 00:20:28.680, Speaker C: Everyone else gets into this whole mess. So I strongly, strongly agree with what you're saying, Mike, and that there's just not going to be interop for quite a while. That is just so far down the list of things we need to build.
00:20:29.210 - 00:20:40.680, Speaker A: If David were on this podcast, you know what he would say? Something about IBC and mesh security, baby, that's what he would say. Sounds like that could solve some of that.
00:20:41.530 - 00:21:13.646, Speaker D: Yeah. So I have a lot of thoughts to unpack on all these subjects. We started off with. Mike's point of, is it going to be these off chain market makers who are just creating some sort of unified liquidity layer, even though it's not really unified, but that's bringing liquidity from one network to another? Or kind of, are we going to have interoperability similar to how the ZK stack works and hyperbridging. But one thing is hyper bridging is async composability, meaning it's interoperability, but over a period of time. So it might take a couple of minutes. I don't necessarily think that that's the best solution.
00:21:13.646 - 00:21:46.842, Speaker D: It's not bad, but it's not great because you can't really do, for instance, what if you're trying to buy Pepe on arbitrum or some coin that only exists on arbitrum. Obviously, Pepe is not actually there, and you have Ethan main net. It's going to take you like eight to twelve to 15 minutes to actually get that transaction to go through. Maybe that's not ideal. So I'm not sure how I feel about the async or asynchronous composability. And that kind of goes back to what you were saying, Dan, with this idea of a shared bridge on l one is kind of how these Ek ropes would talk. But there's also the idea of sharing a sequencer, which would allow for atomic composability or atomicity.
00:21:46.842 - 00:22:29.046, Speaker D: So like immediate ability to, within the same block, have communicate between these different ecosystems, which to me sounds better. Obviously, it has a whole slew of its own problems associated with it. And then kind of to your point, Sam, it's like this BD knife fight between l two s is about to come into production. We're going to see optimism, arbitram, ZK, sync scroll, Sarknet, et cetera, and their BD teams and their grant programs just paying enormous amounts of money to have any interesting app come build there. So it's like I haven't really formed great theses on all these different topics yet. But I hope you're wrong, Mike. I hope that we have, at least on chain settlement, even if you have off chain market makers who are fulfilling orders, like with account extraction or intents.
00:22:29.046 - 00:22:46.770, Speaker D: I hope that that's kind of where we end up with on chain settlement at the end where you still don't have any trust assumptions involved, and you do kind of have this unified liquidity. But obviously, it seems like at least my takeaway from ECC was that's like 510 years out, at a minimum, on the earlier side. So while I could hope for that, I do kind of agree with you.
00:22:46.920 - 00:23:20.554, Speaker A: All right, let me make my case for the centralization of builders. So you were starting to get into some of it there. And I was listening, as one does walking on my way to work this morning, I was listening to Xerox Research. Just catch it up on the latest app. And I listened to this episode with Brian from Layer Zero, and I actually wrote down a little quote, and he said, what bridges are doing is solving an inventory problem. That's what they're doing. You have assets on chain a, and you want to do something on chain b.
00:23:20.554 - 00:24:23.262, Speaker A: So they're managing an inventory problem, which is largely, I think, how you would describe the job of a market maker. You are warehousing risk and managing inventory. So I want to just set that up to say, there you got layer Zero, one of the gigabrain bridge actual sort of crypto solutions, describing very similar set of problems that a market maker might think that their job is solving. But let me just lay out what I view as the three big drivers of centralized builders, right? And the bullcase for centralized builders is like, they give a much better user experience, right? Eventually, chains are very difficult to use, and this kind of gets into intense based architecture. But driver number one is the intense based architecture, right? So, basically, if we're going to have this multichain world with different roll ups and different layer ones, expecting users to be able to figure that out is simply not realistic. Even me, who you guys are more on chain native than I am. But I have a lot of trouble, just, frankly, moving my assets around to where I want them to be.
00:24:23.262 - 00:25:08.030, Speaker A: And I have a heart attack every time I move them through a bridge. I'm not even sure what I really have at the other end of the bridge, and I'm on the left side of the bell curve firmly. But if I have these questions, then I just don't think it's probably feasible that many people will figure this out. What's coming in to solve that is intense based architectures. That is to say, instead of having to execute each one of these transactions, there will be some sort of pool or protocol where you can submit complicated sets of preferences that you will then farm those out to sophisticated on chain actors, read builders, they will go and execute that against some bar which is determined know good at best execution. Right. Like best execution was another theme of the conference.
00:25:08.030 - 00:25:12.282, Speaker A: Early examples of that are uniswap X and Cowswap.
00:25:12.346 - 00:25:12.574, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:12.612 - 00:25:50.266, Speaker A: But people that are building even further out would be like anoma. And Chris goes, who by the way, is one of the original, and he kind of designed IBC. So smart guy there, and smart team. So intense based architectures in the meantime are going to drive this need for builders or abstractors who can abstract away a lot of that complexity. Number two driver is these shared sequencers, actually. So Matt, you were describing, like, shared sequencers will provide atomic composability, they can do atomic inclusion, but they're dumb pipes and they're not state aware of what's going on across different roll ups. So you need someone to actually do atomic execution as well.
00:25:50.266 - 00:26:39.354, Speaker A: So in order to get that atomic composability or cross domain meb or anything, these shared sequencers are literally designing a pipe that only a big builder can fit with. So actually shared sequencers are actually a driver for big builders too. And then the last one is actually something Vitalik was describing, which kind of went over my head, so I'm going to try to just. But he was describing the state of proofs and proofs. There's some set of standards and proofs that are changing, but proofs have a very high fixed cost, very low variable, because roughly the amount of things that go into these aggregate proofs will be the same. But posting one proof will be expensive, high sort of barrier to entry, fixed cost, and that's good for big builders. I'm not sure if italic listens, but Talik, I hope I just.
00:26:39.354 - 00:27:08.840, Speaker A: Did you like all of those things together, I think, mean that we'll have larger builders. I would actually say, matt, that I think the acceptable compromise to make is as long as we have a very decentralized set of proposers, and hopefully as many solo proposers or self stakers as we can, I think that's an acceptable compromise. But sorry guys, that was a long diatribe. I'd be curious what you guys think about that as well.
00:27:12.330 - 00:27:32.510, Speaker C: I've been thinking a lot about shared sequencers as well. I talked to Ben from espresso. Shout out to them. They recently announced their launch on Testnet with Polygon TKVM. Super exciting to see that in production and it's just like, it makes sense technically why you'd want this, right? You get to decentralize your sequencer. There's definitely good branding there. That's the right thing to do.
00:27:32.510 - 00:27:54.900, Speaker C: And it's starting to actually work. So I get that. My unanswered question is, if I'm an l two with an abundant ecosystem, with a lot of activity, people are on top of my chain, that economic activity is happening on top of me. Why am I willing to opt in to give that economic activity to somebody else?
00:28:00.600 - 00:28:15.580, Speaker B: I strongly agree. I think of it the same way. I actually tweeted yesterday. I was like, I think l two s are just visa Mastercard equivalent for web3. Like, think about it, what do visa and Mastercard do? They settle transactions. Like, they submit them for settlement. They literally detect fraud.
00:28:15.580 - 00:28:48.996, Speaker B: It's the exact same thing. And then you're transaction. So I strongly agree with you. It's like, why would an ecosystem of l two s that's settling all of this value want to give away that primary value proposition to a shared sequencer network? It just makes no sense. And actually, I don't know if you got to ask Ben from Espresso systems if they have, because originally we asked them this on the pod like two months ago, but I think they're going to shift their revenue model to actually return wherever the most MEV is derived from. That revenue will actually go to the respective chain and then we'll take a little cut on top. I think that model sounds like an.
00:28:49.018 - 00:29:25.440, Speaker D: Amazing idea and really hard to put in practice. One thing I've been thinking a lot about was if you have a MeV extracting sequencer, because MeV does exist on l two s, even with first in, first out ordering through sex Dex arbitrage, like between finance and Uniswap. So how do you extract that value and give it back to users? And the problem isn't extracting the value. We figured out great mechanisms to do that. But how do you actually know which users that MeV came from? Or in your case, how do you actually know which chains that MeV came from? I guess you could host separate auctions, but then you probably bring in a latency issue. And Mike, to what you were saying, I know that's true with shared sequencers, but I'm not sure it's necessarily true with centralized sequencers. So if you share.
00:29:25.440 - 00:30:01.640, Speaker D: This is going to sound ridiculous, and I apologize, but if you share a sequencer between multiple l two s, that's a centralized sequencer, so you have the same centralized sequencer on multiple networks, it wouldn't be that hard for them to run a node and be state aware. So I don't really buy into the decentralized sequencer thesis. I haven't seen how that's going to work in theory, but I kind of do buy into maybe you could have quasi decentralized like six or seven sequencers, or one sequencer that does multiple roll ups. But obviously this is like a design space that's very nascent and unexplored.
00:30:01.800 - 00:30:51.884, Speaker A: Okay, I have pushed back against all you guys there, so I'm going to say some spicy stuff, and you guys tell where I'm wrong in terms of why shared sequencers are going to be necessary. I think there will be some use cases that eventually demand more centralization. Or even if it's not that eventually there will be a regulatory need for these protocols to decentralize their sequencer set. I actually would guess like, look, the MEV extraction is really good, they're printing money for the time being. But I think for people to ultimately, to your point before, there's a reason why a lot of these major Dapps have not migrated. I think that is very significant, right? There's already cheaper transactions. And I think part of that is because of the security assurances that you get on eth main chain, and they just have not been able to replicate on that on l two.
00:30:51.884 - 00:31:29.944, Speaker A: So if they want that, then you need to go, or they need to find a way to decentralize sequencers and also provers, I would say, for the ZK stuff. The other thing that I would say is, I am going to go ahead and say, I think I see this growing acceptance that the escape hatch, or being able to force include your transactions and account to the l one, make it okay to be a centralized sequencer. And I think that is bullshit. And I think it's bullshit for two reasons. One, because I would never be able to figure that out. My stuff will be gone. I'd be the last out.
00:31:29.944 - 00:31:57.116, Speaker A: I think realistically what's going to happen is the big guys, the hedge funds, the exchanges, all the elite players that are actually very tech savvy will understand how to do it. They'll migrate their assets. And then me, my little minnow, I'm going to be caught up there. I'm going to hold onto the boat, and I'm just going to be laid out to dry. I just don't think I'm going to figure out how to do it. The other thing too, is that you can imagine a world where da. Costs are going to be way cheaper up there.
00:31:57.116 - 00:32:42.112, Speaker A: Computation is going to be way cheaper. There will be businesses that are built on these layer twos that will not be feasible on main chain. Right? Like in a world where you actually have apps that achieve product market fit, are servicing millions of different users, have tons of different transactions that are going through every day. Those economies are going to be built with a certain, those businesses are going to be built with a certain set of cost assumptions. And you can't just migrate that down to main chain, right? None of the economics will work. But then also, if we have these multiple different. If we don't get perfect interoperability, the stuff that you built on one chain won't just perfectly be able to port over to another.
00:32:42.112 - 00:33:04.676, Speaker A: I just think that's a ridiculous assumption. Let's be really generous and say after like two months you could figure that out. Your whole business is toast. If I'm putting myself in the shoes of a founder, I am not building a business on a roll up that has one centralized sequencer. I just wouldn't do it. The risk would be too high. So that's my pushback.
00:33:04.676 - 00:33:06.810, Speaker A: So what do you guys think? Am I wrong?
00:33:09.580 - 00:33:20.876, Speaker B: I couldn't agree more with your first point. If there's not a button on your website that says connect, wallet, enforce, withdraw, then how the hell am I going to figure that out? So, yeah, I strongly agree with that.
00:33:20.898 - 00:33:52.824, Speaker D: I couldn't agree. So for the forced inclusion versus the escape hatch. All right, I totally agree. Sorry. I totally agree overall with your point about basically if you're holding a native asset, an LP position or something of that nature on an l two and the sequencer goes down, you're screwed. Because the paradigm and a 16 z and whoever else are going to get into ETH and whatever other assets are held in that bridge contract on that one, and they're going to get out. But if you're holding an asset that's actually in that bridge contract, you will get your assets out.
00:33:52.824 - 00:34:24.864, Speaker D: So just like a little bit of pushback there. But overall, I completely agree with your sentiment with the shared sequencers. I don't see that as like a risk mitigated. I don't see using espresso as mitigating all your risk that the sequencer is going to go down and thus the LT is going to lose all its value and be a problem. I actually think maybe even the opposite. I think maybe today, if you're trusting the gaming entity or whatever that's running arbitram sequencer, I think that I might have more faith in that than the untested astrispresso. But maybe I'm wrong, but that's kind of my pushback there.
00:34:24.982 - 00:35:32.772, Speaker C: I think I tend to agree with that last point, Matt. Centralization and decentralization has trade offs, and one of the pros of centralization in my mind tends to be like performance and Ux. And I kind of think one entity running an AWS instance that's cranking out these transactions will probably do a better job, at least in the near term. Benfish had a pretty good explanation on why espresso will work and have a low latency and not being adding additional overhead that I thought was pretty interesting. And I am for sure going to botch this, but I'm going to give it a whirl anyways. And so we were having a conversation around how is it actually going to work? And basically you're going to have to have another consensus mechanism that is operating these shared sequencers as they rotate in and to do their job. And somebody asked, is just slapping another consensus mechanism on top of this thing? Is that really the best solution here? And it kind of feels like you're just stacking proof of stake systems on top of each other.
00:35:32.772 - 00:36:14.068, Speaker C: You could kind of take that out. When does it go? When does it end? Is this actually the best way? And he had a great response, and it was like, look, Ethereum is already running two consensus mechanisms. It has a slower time to finality, one to make sure after this moment hits, which is, I think it's about ten to 12 minutes on Ethereum, we have guaranteed finality. And so that's one consensus mechanism running that operation. And in between the point of finality and the lead head block, there's another consensus mechanism happening that's getting validators to vote in a test on the accuracy of this information and these blocks. And that's why Ethereum didn't go down when it had its client issue. Gosh, that's probably already a couple of months ago now.
00:36:14.068 - 00:36:48.720, Speaker C: And so we already have two consensus mechanisms running Ethereum today. And if you just add a third one onto that, it's like, okay, the jump from one to two feels like a lot, but the jump from two to three feels fairly marginal. And I'm like, all right, so if you just added a third consensus mechanism that was like basically executing transactions on the l two s connected to Ethereum, okay, maybe that starts to make sense. And then this immediately goes back to like, well, that should probably be enshrined. And I feel like this is like this huge narrative of if there's any good idea today, everybody just wants to get it enshrined. And I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
00:36:48.790 - 00:37:47.292, Speaker D: That brings me to another point that I heard at ETCC, which is something I'm so curious about. It's been bothering me for a week now. But the first day I got there, Monday, last week I went to this know proposer builder separation salon or something, where it was basically just gigabrains talking about the future of Ethereum and how they're going to deal with mev things like Mevburn and PEPC and all these other, whatever moral of the story Justin Drake makes. He's giving a presentation, and at the very end the last thing he says is, I've come up with what I believe is a solution to create based roll ups that have instant soft confirmations. I'm sitting here, I'm thinking to myself, holy shit, because, okay, so what's a base roll up? A base roll up is a roll up that is sequenced by the l one. Why is that actually not something that really we're using today, or isn't really an implementation or execution? Mostly because it would have twelve second block times, and it wouldn't really create much of a better ux than interacting with Ethereum, while it does still help with some of the problems around scaling. But if you can have instant soft confirmations on a base roll up, well, now, maybe all of this is dumb.
00:37:47.292 - 00:37:59.448, Speaker D: And I walk up to him, I ask, how are you going to do this? And he says, you'll have to. You know, one of my huge tidbits of information I got that I'm just sitting on, but I thought that was very interesting.
00:37:59.614 - 00:38:04.090, Speaker C: Matt, give the listeners a quick definition on what a base rollup is.
00:38:06.300 - 00:38:35.276, Speaker D: Yeah, based rollup is literally just normal roll up, but instead of using a centralized sequencer or a shared sequencer set or anything like that. So for instance, today arbitrum has a single centralized sequencer. We just talked about Espresso for a while, which is another one that's trying to create a decentralized sequencer. Astria is another one trying to do something similar. There's a ton of design going on in the flashbots forums and in other places, such as like at the arbitram research forums about what these sequencers should look like. And a base roll up just relies on the l one on Ethereum validators.
00:38:35.308 - 00:39:16.092, Speaker A: To do the sequencing one for you guys that I would like to get your opinion on here. So let's talk a little bit about enshrining and this idea of moving back to enshrining. So Sriram on yesterday's bell curve, which y'all aren't listeners, you go check it out. So he actually said the explicit goal of Eigen layers to be enshrined within Ethereum. That's like his explicit goal. What he wants to do after he said that. We were at ECC last week and there was a lot of talk about whether or not that makes sense to do so outside of just like enshrining smart contracts that would help with l two interoperability.
00:39:16.092 - 00:40:28.432, Speaker A: There's also this question of, frankly, Eigen layer. And I think Ethereum a while ago made this set of decisions where they wanted to limit complexity and outsource critical functions of a platform, like block building something like to something like flashbots, or delegated proof of stake, or delegating stake to something like lido. And now Ethereum is kind of reaching this point where it's like, oh shit, maybe this is too important to be outside of the platform or outside of the Ethereum protocol itself, and are thinking about bringing certain of those elements back into Ethereum. The protocol and Eigen layer is a very interesting one from my perspective, which sort of is like, on this spectrum of, there are two very different sets of design philosophies when it comes to how to manage your validators between Ethereum and cosmos. On the Ethereum side, there was actually a great presentation. Maybe some of you saw this screenshot, but validators should be cucks, which is just to say they should be really dumb and commoditized and spread out and powerless, kind of. And then the cosmos philosophy is like, what can your validators do for you? Your validators should be doing more than validating.
00:40:28.432 - 00:41:10.452, Speaker A: They can run application code, you can do things like vote extensions, and they can weigh in on all these other things. They should be able to be an oracle if they want. And Eigen layer is like the bridge in. So it's basically, it's a good middle ground of doing. Your validators don't have to also be an oracle, but they should be able to opt in to becoming an oracle, right? So it's like blurring the line between these design philosophies of the validator sets of ethereum and cosmos. And I sort of came away being like, there will be something like, if it's not Eigenv directly that's enshrined, it's PEPC, actually, which stands for protocol enforced proposer commitments. That's the same thing.
00:41:10.452 - 00:41:43.868, Speaker A: There's like an enshrined mechanism which allows validators, proposers, to make a commitment to doing a certain action. And if that commitment is not honored, then the block that they propose will not be valid. So I feel like commitments are actually going to be a buzzword for the next six to nine months. You're going to keep hearing these word commitments. Commitments. And commitments refers to either this spectrum of what a validator should do, or it also will be builders. That again, abstract away some of the challenges of l two.
00:41:43.868 - 00:42:27.596, Speaker A: So like Dan, that problem that you were saying before about the way proofs work right now on ZK era, what you could do is get a builder in there to do little soft commitments. Or say that, yeah, we think this proof, let's just say the proof time period is an hour. You could have a builder come in and say, I'm going to commit, I'm going to issue soft commitments in between this hour to transactions that happen, with the understanding that there's going to be a proof and extract some profit that way. So I actually think commitments is going to be a big buzword over the next like six or nine months. And that's what it refers. Yeah. What do you guys think?
00:42:27.778 - 00:43:03.048, Speaker C: Do you think Eigen layer should be enshrined? Is that the best solution here? And when should that happen? Because today Eigen layer has some restaking going on. But I don't believe any of these solutions being built on top of the Eigen layer are alive yet. So do you wait for this thing to get big and then be like, okay, this is clearly important, people clearly demand it, let's enshrine it? Or do you try to front run that and be know at that point, maybe it doesn't want to become enshrined because it already has this native demand, or do you try to get ahead of that and do it before it occurs and risk enshrining something that never gets used?
00:43:03.134 - 00:43:37.788, Speaker D: I think there's an even better thing to look at than PEPC or lido in this example, which is PBS. Because PBS exists right through Medboost. Like flashbots created Medboost. It was a short term solution. It wasn't meant to last that long. But if we don't enshrine PBS in the next six to twelve months, there's a good chance that medboost becomes a mature product. And at some point it's like, well, why do we have to enshrine it? Especially because now they're talking about these caps on block builders bids, so it's like we're still going to need relays.
00:43:37.788 - 00:44:06.380, Speaker D: So everything I hear makes me think like, okay, why are we even enshrining this in the first place? And the answer is, I really don't know. To some extent, and this is going to make me sound a little dumb, but to some extent, I don't even really know what entrining something is. Obviously, I know account abstraction was entrined with ERc four, three, seven, but at the same time, I don't even really know what it is. I know it's including the protocol, but it's hard to really put into words. So it's like, yeah, I guess that's my take there.
00:44:06.450 - 00:44:33.776, Speaker B: I agree with that take. Plus, I don't know if you remember a while ago, but there was like a bug in Mevboo software. So had that been implemented and enshrined from the get go, that could have been a lot worse than it actually was. So I agree that these things should be tested in production before you just go, hey, let's go ahead and throw this in the protocol at the base layer forever, because you really don't know. And I think that's kind of the strategy with the count abstraction, too. It's like, hey, l two s, please start working on this. I feel like you guys need to be experimenting with this.
00:44:33.776 - 00:45:10.000, Speaker B: So maybe one day we have it on the Eth L one, and then just to the point of eigen layer specifically. Really, I don't know what it is, but I just have this gut feeling. And it's actually funny because we talked about Ben from Espresso, but on that same pod was Josh from Astria, and he was saying, I just know something's going to blow up from restaking. You can't leverage economic security over and over and over and over again. And I know Sriram has a pretty good rebuttal to this, but I tend to side with Josh. I just seems a little bit dangerous for something that we have that's so pure and taking so long to build to this date to really put in jeopardy just on the new coolest idea.
00:45:10.070 - 00:45:39.428, Speaker C: I don't know, man. Every time we get into these types of conversations about the troubles with scaling l two s and restaking and doing this and doing that, it just makes me want to go back to Salana. Give me one single shard. Man. The problems over there really harder to solve than like this. And we had to come up with an entirely new technology and zero knowledge proving just to get to the point where we can be like, okay, this thing could probably scale. That is mind boggling.
00:45:39.428 - 00:45:48.060, Speaker C: And man, I don't know, sometimes it's just like, I feel like we're doing too much to make this thing work when maybe there's a better solution.
00:45:48.560 - 00:46:32.764, Speaker A: Yeah, let me sort of build on that idea. The big difference between Solana and Ethereum is that, again, there was a difference in terms of how validators should look. It's like Ethereum wants there to be lots of individual solo stakers. And Solana is more okay with large institutional stakers that might leverage a data center and be okay with paying more per month. So let's assume, Sam, that Eigen layer actually is fine and doesn't blow up. But here's the other thing that will likely happen. So liquid staking is taking off, right? The stake rate is going up and up and up for ETH, which means that the return on staking, like the average yield that you get for staking, is going down and down and down and down.
00:46:32.764 - 00:47:47.730, Speaker A: So eventually, what might be the case? You could imagine a future even within the next like nine or 18 months, that in order to really profitably validate, you actually have to opt into these other sort of eigen layer enabled restaking sort of solutions. Because is it really worth staking if you're getting like a 2% yield, especially when the three month treasury is at like 6%? That just doesn't seem like a sustainable thing. So you actually might end up having to, in order to be profitable as a validator, you might end up having to opt into all of these additional middleware type hardware, like doing eigenda, which I, by the way, also think is a great product, or opting into running sequencing software for one of these roll ups, or like any other number of things. So suddenly, in order to be a profitable validator, you have to do all of these things anyway that have a much higher cost in hardware requirement. And then where are we? We're back with Solana. We're back with Solana sized cost bases and levels of complexity at the validator level. So there's like this history, especially in Ethereum, of very well intended design decisions that ignore the economics of all the actors that are in the system.
00:47:47.730 - 00:48:10.712, Speaker A: Like not enshrining some amount way to delegate your stake is a good example of that. Like not being a delegated proof of stake consensus mechanism. And then the market finds a way. Like you don't enshrine a way to delegate, you're going to get Lido, you take away proposers ability to do this, then you're going to get Eigen layer, the market finds a way.
00:48:10.766 - 00:48:10.936, Speaker D: Right?
00:48:10.958 - 00:48:25.776, Speaker A: And then what are we going to do? Make it illegal for validators to do extra stuff? I mean, how could you even enforce that? So, I don't know, it's just interesting. I don't know if I even have a take. But all these things are converging, sort of.
00:48:25.878 - 00:49:00.040, Speaker C: And then further to that, I think there might be like a logical pushback to this. Okay. In that world, we have a slowly consolidating validator set that's getting more expensive to run, and therefore kind of pulling out the number of at home stakers. Plus you have seven relays and maybe five to six builders that win a majority of blocks. Are we just recreating tradfi with different major players? I don't know, sam, Matt, I'm curious to get your thoughts here.
00:49:00.110 - 00:49:28.596, Speaker B: I just don't buy it. I think, honestly, if the yield return in ETH native terms gets that low, the float on Eth is going to be ridiculously low. There is going to be no eth left to borrow. There's going to be no ETH left anywhere. The price would be going so high that you don't care if you're making 0.5% APR because the dollar denominated amount. Like I've heard this argument, and I think the natural dynamics of supply and demand are going to play out here.
00:49:28.596 - 00:49:36.928, Speaker B: And this is all just like people having a hard time wrapping their heads around the dollar price of ETH versus an ETH APR.
00:49:37.104 - 00:49:56.396, Speaker D: Personally, this brings me back to a super interesting conversation that Dan, Sam and I were having in the back of a club late at night, with an insanely smart, we're, keep in mind, had a couple of beers, but at the end of the day, we're talking Mev because, yeah, I guess that's what we do on our Friday nights anyway, t.
00:49:56.418 - 00:49:59.740, Speaker A: Shirts that say that had a couple beers, but we're talking Mev.
00:50:00.800 - 00:50:01.790, Speaker C: We're cool.
00:50:05.440 - 00:50:52.268, Speaker D: Really, really smart. Know someone I respect heavily, basically has this thesis that for Morgan, Blackrock, et cetera, all these big bank, Citigroup, et cetera, to get into crypto, the way it's going to work is they're going to slowly acquire all this ethereum, they're going to run validators, they're going to run relayers, and they're going to run builders, and in order to get included in a block that one of their validators proposes, you're going to have to censor, because these companies are huge companies. They have to abide by KYC, AML and a host of other regulatory enforcements. So that's just how it's going to work. And his thesis was that they were going to acquire enough EtH that basically the entire Ethereum network to some extent would have to be censored for it to work. And that was kind of his base case for what Ethereum looks like. And in my head, I'm arguing back, I'm like, there's no way this is what it is.
00:50:52.268 - 00:51:21.290, Speaker D: If those banks are going to acquire that much eth, they're going to go use a network like Solana, or they're going to go create their own blockchain where there's nine validators, that is thumb nine. And you can ignore 95% of the design decisions, maybe 99% of the design decisions that Ethereum has made in the past because those were all to enable decentralization. And he's like, well, it doesn't matter that you think that that's what they should do because EtH is where they're going to want to be and all of what, you know, sorry. And I just thought it was such an interesting conversation, so I wanted to bring it up and I thought related to this Solana convo as.
00:51:23.340 - 00:52:26.876, Speaker C: So the night of, I adamantly disagree with you, but I've kind of come around to it a little bit because the idea of why you'd go build on Ethereum still kind of made sense to me because that's where the user, not necessarily the users, because you're kind of coming with the users and the liquidity, right? If you're this KYC tradfi player, you have the users, you have the capital, you're kind of like bringing the party with you, but you still need the applications to use. And that's something that a lot of other blockchains haven't figured out yet. Okay, yes, there's a Defi ecosystem that's starting to blossom again on Solana, but none of that is battle tested for billions of dollars of capital, whereas Aave and curve and Uniswap are processing billions of dollars daily. And even some of the OG DeFi protocols maybe don't even get used as much anymore. Maybe compound still holds billions of dollars in assets. And to me that matters significantly. But I also thought it was just interesting because he kind of painted the picture of how this would actually happen.
00:52:26.876 - 00:52:58.620, Speaker C: And I didn't necessarily think about this before, and it makes sense, right? If you have your own network of validators, and maybe you only own like 10% of the ETH network. Whenever those validators go up to propose a block, you can just look at one relayer that looks at one builder and you're always therefore picking the highest block. And it is possible to have a centralization vector in Ethereum, and you can argue whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it's possible today. But yeah, I guess it does require buying a material position of staked.
00:52:58.800 - 00:54:00.692, Speaker A: Actually, Matt, on the night of, I actually disagreed with you too, but now I agree with you. What you're describing actually is what you actually had that sophisticated actor in the form of like this is what SPF did. He literally was like, yeah, I want to play these weird games with FTT and all this stuff, and he didn't do it on Ethereum. The cost of attack is too high where I would actually quibble with this guy too. I don't think Morgan is doing any of this stuff where what I do think is probably going to happen is like Citadel is about to be a massive player in crypto or someone like them, because they will figure this stuff out and they will find a way to play these games and act as infrastructure and stuff like that. But I think at this point doing that to Ethereum would be too costly. And what you're describing too is the ability to the liquid staking protocols can facilitate institutional staking requirements with KYC validators.
00:54:00.692 - 00:54:45.032, Speaker A: So for instance, Lido has a staking router. They've launched a staking router. So instead of just being a whitelisted set of like 34 node operators or whatever it is, there are going to be tons of different modules and there can just be a KYC institutional validator set run by chorus one and block Damon. And what Lido can do is just connect big institutional stakers with that validator set. And there doesn't have to be this weird, they're co opting Ethereum. It's like that'll probably just be a business and Lido will be like a liquid staking as a service type token and they'll intermediate and connect those other. I have taken that one step further, giving some alpha, but I actually think Lido has a built in bribe mechanism as well.
00:54:45.032 - 00:56:05.410, Speaker A: So similarly to how know there's like a bribe mechanism to you do ve, like lock up your tokens in ve and you can direct liquidity within the protocol. Let's say you're a right or Morgan or whoever, like a big financial institutional allocator. And you want to allocate some eth, right? You want to allocate to the cheapest possible validator set, right? You go to Lido and there's the ability for you to be connected with a certain validator set that meets your requirements. And then the governance of lido sets the fees, right? So you could either pay the fees that the lido program that Lido governance had set, or you can buy up a bunch of lido, you can create a proposal that we want to include more institutional stakers and yada yada. So we should lower the fees on this particular staking module to 0%. You get that passed in governance, and then you stake all your stuff and you pay 0% to the protocol. You see what I'm saying? In the same way that there's an incentive to buy curve, lock it up, and then direct liquidity to your pool, there's also the same incentive in lido to buy up a bunch of LDO, reduce your validation fees, and then validate that way.
00:56:06.100 - 00:56:33.444, Speaker C: There's some alpha coming from Mike himself that's really interesting. And I kind of want to work backwards because I have a couple of points. So that is pretty interesting. And I think we're going to have to figure out a way to make tokens useful. And we don't know what that looks like. And this is like a go to jail statement, but in the long run, I think tokens are programmable equity. We always had this huge narrative around programmable money and why that's important, what that unlocks.
00:56:33.444 - 00:57:15.000, Speaker C: And everybody knew tokens were like this cool thing, but that's effectively what they've become. If you look at it today, there's a lot of tokens out there that look just like equity, but they can also do more. So where equity gives you a legal claim on the cash flows of a business, tokens can give you programmatic claims on the cash flows of a protocol. And I think that's like a narrative. We're starting to kind of see the early innings of play out and this whole debate in the sec of what is a token and how should this be accounted, and is it equity, and are these unregulated securities? And I think you're going to have three categories, tokens, equities, commodities. That is the direction I'd really like to see things go. But not to get on too big of a tangent there.
00:57:15.000 - 00:57:34.656, Speaker C: I just like the idea of lido being like, okay, how are we going to make this thing useful outside of just being like this instrument we use to raise capital. So excited to kind of see that. And on your first point, I do have a question. It's like, if you're a large. I don't know. You said, morgan's. Let's stick with them.
00:57:34.656 - 00:58:26.176, Speaker C: For the example, if you have these very strict KYC AML terms and you have a business that generates billions of dollars and you're trying to break into something new, and that is not your core business, that does not generate you billions of dollars, are you going to take the risk of your staking transactions, which, yes, through the lido staking router, it touched no malicious actors, and you can guarantee improve that. But what if it's in the same block as a terrorist transaction or the Lazarus group sending a transaction? Is that okay? I have no idea what the answer to that question is. And then just one other thing I want to hammer down on that point, but I did ran some quick numbers, and if you were to accumulate 10% of the staked ETh today, you'd have to accumulate $5 billion of ETH, which is. Yeah, to your point, Mike, that's probably not going to happen.
00:58:26.358 - 00:58:55.668, Speaker A: Yeah. So in order of response there, I think that friction that you're describing is why Tradfi is going to take a long. Any tradfi that has, like, a fiduciary obligation, it's still far off. The pensions are not coming in en masse here. They're just not doing it yet. But where you will see that is larger and larger pools of principal capital. So I think it's going to continue to be like the jumps and the Jane streets and some parts of Citadel.
00:58:55.668 - 00:59:24.130, Speaker A: So I think those are the ones that are going to end up taking risk. They're the ones who are more tech savvy anyway, and the institutional adoption is going to be a while, and by the time they're ready to plan any sophisticated attacks like this or co opt the chain, it's just going to be too expensive and large. I know we're all big believers in crypto, and it's like, yeah, it's just $5 billion to co opt Ethereum. Imagine pitching that. Imagine pitching that in a bank. Here, I got a $5 billion trade idea for you. Magic Internet money.
00:59:24.130 - 00:59:27.010, Speaker A: I just don't see it.
00:59:28.500 - 00:59:53.432, Speaker B: I agree. Plus, I also did get the chance to talk to someone from Morgan's research team on the crypto side of things, and there was two takeaways there. One, there's a private blockchain solution called Onyx that he has been working on. So I do think that's kind of the direction they're going to head. And then two, he mentioned the first DeFi transaction they did on Polygon, and I was like, oh, shit, I completely forgot about that. I'm a fish brain because I work in crypto. And he was just like, yeah.
00:59:53.432 - 01:00:30.932, Speaker B: Unfortunately, though, the FTX stuff definitely had an impact on our ability to actually mess around with these things. So I thought that was really weird to actually see the tangible effects. I guess a year later in some change of large institutions, actually saying, yeah, FTX was kind of a tough one. And then one other big takeaway from a web two company that I talked to, there was the thesis that it's really business to business and not business to consumer. Apparently there is just zero demand from the consumer right now to actually use crypto applications. And the thesis there was, I think the real use case is business to business. Going cross border between different business units is incredibly difficult today.
01:00:30.932 - 01:00:47.308, Speaker B: There's a real use case for it. So kind of thought that was cool. But honestly, the main takeaway for me was just like, they're still there, which is really cool. They're at ZK unconference in Paris. So I'm just kind of like, wow, all right, that's a good step. Since three years ago, even I want.
01:00:47.314 - 01:01:28.570, Speaker C: To jump in here and take a quick second to shout out the atom accelerator for sponsoring our show. Again, if you're a developer, I'm sure our passionate listeners have heard this, but again, the point of the message is to really bring the developers to the ecosystem. If you're looking for a home, looking for somewhere to build, looking for a community that is actually excited to push their project and their economic zone forward. It's the Cosmos hub, and there really is no second best here. Interchange security is not only launched and active, but actually pushing out new blocks. And we talked about the ideas of eigen layered restaking and why that's important. Well, you have interchange security, which looks quite similar in live in production today.
01:01:28.570 - 01:02:15.240, Speaker C: And further to that, you also have IBC, which we also got a shout out on this show as being just like a great interop solution that actually works, and it's live today. So we see these ideas of things that actually work, and that's personally refreshing. And that's why I'm a fan of the cosmos ecosystem. But we also have USDC coming stride, pushing the advancement of LSTs duality, setting the new standard for value accrual when it comes to the contractual relationship with the cosmos. Hub for ics. So again, if you are a builder looking to get kick started on bringing a project to the cosmos ecosystem, look no further than the link in the description that is the atom accelerator page. They are doing grants on a rolling monthly basis from $10,000 to $1 million.
01:02:15.240 - 01:02:44.304, Speaker C: So again, be sure to check out that link in the show notes. But yeah, I want to get back to that kind of discussion of what does institutional adoption look like and where does it happen? Is really this question that I'm playing with. Sam, I know you're not necessarily a fan of, but you have this idea of KYCL two. Walk us through that and kind of why you think that that's where these guys end up going to play.
01:02:44.422 - 01:03:18.504, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a depressing outcome, honestly. Better than a centralized, I guess, block building, I guess, solution on Ethereum main net, though. So I think it's better. It's better than the actual base layer becoming prone to censorship. But the general thesis just, it's pretty simple, really. It's going to be that regulators are going to require that big institutions know their customers, and I think that the best way to do that is to control the on and off ramp. Like, it'd be really easy to spin up a bridging user interface where you kyc'd and then you hopped on the chain.
01:03:18.504 - 01:03:46.196, Speaker B: You're kind of in your own little silo. You really don't interrupt anywhere, except maybe like a cohort of other Kyc l two s in your constellation that you painted earlier, Dan. But yeah, I just think it generally makes sense. There's too much to account for. There's taxes, like we talked about. What if you're in the same block as some terrorist group on the other side of the world? It makes the most sense. And I think it's ultimately the way that regulators can kind of get their way while we do too.
01:03:46.196 - 01:03:56.280, Speaker B: Because ultimately you can go down to the censorship resistant base layer that is ethereum. So not perfect, but that is kind of a theory I think is somewhat likely.
01:03:57.260 - 01:05:22.900, Speaker A: I'm not sure if I have any special insight on Kyc del two s, but one thing I will say is at some point along the line, some compromises will need to be made either to fit existing regulatory regimes, which I'm less of a fan of, or just like better user experience, which I'm more of a fan of. Buried at the heart of decentralization is this idea that you are going to decentralize decision making across a whole bunch of different people. And sometimes there are really hard, challenging problems to solve that you really want in the hands of the most capable person. And so decentralizing it will actually lead to a worse user experience outcome. So what I actually enjoyed, just to bring it full circle about ECC, was I thought there was a lot of nuanced discussion from people about where decentralization makes the most sense and how can we maintain the most important parts of the good parts of decentralization, but still get acceptable user experiences? Because we've been lacking that so much in crypto. So I don't know if Kyc, Dell two s are, are the way to go, but I do think that some amount of compromise is actually a sign of progress and not a sign of defeat.
01:05:25.080 - 01:05:43.484, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like there is some middle ground here, and it's like, if you want the institutions to come swim in the same waters as everyone else, it's like, how do you build an environment for them to do that without kind of giving up some of the core ethos of crypto? And that's a super unanswered question. So, Matt, I know you're dying inside. Let's hear it.
01:05:43.522 - 01:06:18.656, Speaker D: So I actually don't. Right, like, I have to think about it for a second, because at the end of the day, onboarding, even if the end result of crypto is self custody guarantees, with a system that looks a lot like tradfi, where no one can steal my funds, I guess that's okay. But while you guys got that great insight from ECC, I was looking at all these privacy solutions that are yet to come. Forgetting the name of the one being built on a noma, but it's an l one privacy solution. Namata. Thank you. And Aztec, which will be a ZKL, two that will support privacy.
01:06:18.656 - 01:06:52.320, Speaker D: And I think at the end of the day, this is still a huge space. Maybe we don't spend as much time there, but there's builders building, and I guess we'll just have to see. At least we'll have the option. And I believe that if you build it in a way that supports privacy and supports real censorship resistance, that that's going to be where the end liquidity and users end up. And at the end of the day, that's all that really matters, right? You can create your KYC Dell too, but if you don't get users and liquidity, it doesn't matter. And if it gets all the users in liquidity, well, it wins. So I guess as long as we have the infrastructure that supports both, I'm okay with it.
01:06:52.390 - 01:08:03.050, Speaker C: I actually had this pointed out to me at the ZK unconference, and it's like when we say privacy, yes, ZK will likely lead the way on making this possible. But what do we actually want? Do we want a blockchain where no one knows the addresses, you can't see the transactions, and it's just like this black box, basically then, okay, probably not. We've recreated tradfi, so the other end is know Ethereum, where it's an open ledger where you can see everyone's address, you can see the transactions you're doing, you know, the assets they've hold and they've like, where on that spectrum does privacy make a lot of sense? We had a podcast with Sonny from osmosis not too long ago, and he kind of hit on what they're trying to do is their solution is kind of like maybe abstract away one layer of this privacy and give the users the ability to hide their transactions. But at the end of the day, it doesn't remove the ethos of having a transparent open ledger. So I don't know, maybe that's like a good open question to kind of leave the listeners with this week. What do we mean when we say we want privacy in blockchain? But, all right, everyone, maybe it's a good place to call it. Thanks again for listening this week, and we will see you all next week.
01:08:03.050 - 01:08:07.430, Speaker C: Our.
