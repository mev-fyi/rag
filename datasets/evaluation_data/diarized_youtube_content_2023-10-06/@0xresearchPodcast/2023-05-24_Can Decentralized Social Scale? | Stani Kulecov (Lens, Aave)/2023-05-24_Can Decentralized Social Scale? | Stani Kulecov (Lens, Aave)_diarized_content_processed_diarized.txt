00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.640, Speaker A: Every time you peel back another layer, you just end up figuring out that this thing is again a master class in mechanism design.
00:00:09.490 - 00:00:51.546, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. The show was made possible thanks to our fantastic sponsor, the Atom accelerator. It has literally never been easier or more attractive to build in the cosmos ecosystem. So if you're a contributor looking for grants between $10,000 and $1 million, check out atomaccelerator.com online or look at the show notes today is May 22 and we have an awesome interview lined up with Stannie, the founder of Ave and Lens. He is a true crypto og, so getting his perspective on the current state of DFI and where Ave and Lens are at was super exciting. But as always before that, we are going to hop into a little hot seat cool throne with Ren and effort capital from the Blockworks research team.
00:00:51.546 - 00:00:52.530, Speaker B: Ren, who you got in the hot.
00:00:52.540 - 00:00:53.194, Speaker C: Seat or cool throne?
00:00:53.242 - 00:01:25.682, Speaker D: I got Coinbase in the cruise this week. I know I've sort of talked about them a few furious episodes ago, but slightly different today. Last Thursday, Coinbase one sort of announced their new sorry, Coinbase announced their new Coinbase one program. It's basically a subscription plan for 29 99 a month, and with that subscription you get zero trading fees. You get a lower staking take rate for Cardano, Adam, Salana and XTZ. You get 24/7 dedicated account support. You also get a discount for permissionless.
00:01:25.682 - 00:02:14.950, Speaker D: So if you're going, maybe subscribe for Coinbase one for what I think is a 20% discount. Importantly, you also get a 10% off lemonade, which is kind of like an AI insurance underwriter, so to say. I think it's an interesting trend, right? Because if you're sort of seeing the progression of webTube, everything has eventually transitioned to a subscription. Know YouTube Premium, Netflix, Spotify, Apple Music, everything trends the subscription sooner or later. And I'll be interesting to see whether that trend pays out, starting with Coinbase. And I think there's a few other interesting things that I like to talk about. The first is that there's probably a large amount of retail users which don't generate a huge amount of revenue for the exchange.
00:02:14.950 - 00:02:59.618, Speaker D: So at a 40 Bips maker rate, it would take roughly $8,000 in monthly volume to generate $30 in fees for Coinbase. And I would guess the bottom of the pile. Like retail traders don't generate $8,000 in monthly trading volume. And that 29 99 Coinbase one subscription may generate a lot more revenue for Coinbase and I think another interesting thing is that they included lemonade, which is nothing to do with crypto. It's just like a lifestyle like insurance product. Right? So is it possible that Coinbase is able to onboard more users into crypto by offering more sort of these lifestyle perks? I don't know. You get a monthly free doordash code, you get 20% off Uber.
00:02:59.618 - 00:03:35.634, Speaker D: And maybe I'm sort of like giving the bootcase here. But for example, Coinbase may work together with these companies that they're onboarding into Coinbase one subscriptions and get them to use Coinbase commerce, which is their version of PayPal or Visa, or sort of like their payment system that merchants can use. And I just thought it's an interesting move, probably an off return one, given the current market conditions and how transaction fees and trading volume haven't been the greatest. And they don't look so great for q two so far. But we'd love to hear what you guys think of it.
00:03:35.672 - 00:04:04.474, Speaker A: I can already hear effort capital in the back of my head telling me how not Amazon, but Coinbase rather is taking over the world. And it's funny that I accidentally said Amazon there, but yeah, it seems like an interesting model. I liked your comparisons to kind of how the web two world has become very subscription based. And it's interesting to see the lifestyle edition there. I don't know, effort. Do you have a more interesting take on why they're kind of potentially moving into that lifestyle move?
00:04:04.592 - 00:04:16.746, Speaker E: I mean, if you think about it, Coinbase fundamentally thinks that cryptocurrencies can transform the entire financial sector, create new financial products, and innovate on financial products that haven't seen innovation in decades.
00:04:16.778 - 00:04:17.262, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:17.396 - 00:04:47.330, Speaker E: Like lemonade. It sounds silly. I actually really like the Coinbase commerce angle that you're going with, Ren. I honestly didn't even really think about that. But insurance, we've seen DeFi protocols like Nexus Mutual, which I think gets shit on on crypto Twitter for really not being that good of a product, really not bailing out crypto protocols when they needed. When they're needed as their insurance offering. But I think insurance is an area of finance in general that needs an overhaul.
00:04:47.330 - 00:05:43.654, Speaker E: My mother actually is like an insurance underwriter. It's like, terrible. It doesn't actually pay out users when there's floods. Like flood insurance doesn't even work properly. There's not proper risk frameworks, I think, that properly calculate risk or quantify risk and maybe eventually Coinbase decides to create a lifestyle financial product. Could you imagine Coinbase insurance leveraging defi protocols and leveraging some type of decentralized identity solution on top of that, I feel like there's other product offerings that just by grabbing in the user, leveraging Coinbase, one where it gets entire lifestyle package, on top of the other use cases like their zero fee trading or whatnot on their exchange platform, they're just trying to create a stickier ecosystem, kind of like what Apple did with their phone and their App Store. Once you kind of grab onto the customer, you offer them other products and services to kind of keep them within this ecosystem.
00:05:43.654 - 00:06:18.242, Speaker E: And arguably Apple has the best ecosystem in all tech. You obviously say same thing about Amazon and Apple as well. I'm sorry, Amazon and Facebook as well, or meta. But I think Coinbase trying to figure out other ways to branch out their revenue stream and keep their customer base sticky, especially in a bear market when trading volumes are like the lowest we've seen in literally since 2019 in summit since I believe. I like this move. I mean, it's more recurring revenue, it's decentralizing or distributing their different revenue streams out there. They're the Amazon of Web three.
00:06:18.242 - 00:06:19.034, Speaker E: Good point, Dan.
00:06:19.102 - 00:06:45.950, Speaker B: Yeah, I like the point. You made effort in regards to just smoothing out the revenue. I think that's ultimately the story here. I think they just want more predictable MRR in the long run. Obviously, crypto is pretty volatile as is, so they probably want to smooth that out as best they can. And to be honest, it makes a ton of sense for a ton of people. If you do $15,000 of volume on Coinbase for $30 a month and zero fees, you're probably out positive on that deal.
00:06:45.950 - 00:06:54.702, Speaker B: And you would be sure to redirect your trading volume on Coinbase because you have that subscription. So ultimately it makes a stickier customer base. So I like to play it for sure.
00:06:54.756 - 00:07:44.606, Speaker D: I think one thing that I find interesting is that it doesn't lower the take rate for Eve staking. I mean, Coinbase has the highest take rate for Eve staking out of all staking service provider, whether that's like a centralized exchange or a liquid staking protocol, and it stands at 25% today. I'm not sure how sticky Coinbase thinks their Eve staker customers are, but I would bet not that sticky, especially in the long term. And as these liquid staking protocols become more battle tested, you wouldn't really settle for a 25% take rate when a 10% take rate exists out there. And if I'm not wrong, finance also has a vip program where if you're part of that vip program, you have an even lower take rate than what they're offering normally. And that's kind of shown in the data. Right.
00:07:44.606 - 00:07:54.626, Speaker D: Ever since the chapel upgrade, the amount of Eve that's staked with Coinbase has decreased versus all of the other liquid staking providers, which have gone up by like 1020, 30%.
00:07:54.728 - 00:09:01.986, Speaker A: I don't know, Ren, I might take the other side of this one, because I agree with you. The data definitely shows exactly what you mentioned, but I think there's a very specific reason for that. And the people in crypto right now are all tech savvy, rational investors that want to maximize their profit. But the next wave of users, I don't think will classify as that. And I very much so expect people to pile into the Coinbase app, mint CBE, through the app, and hold CBE, and fully thinking that they're earning the native staking yield. And even if they're aware there's a 25% fee, they'll be totally okay with that because of the ease of access of CBE. And so I think that we're just going to see this separation of investor preferences between ease of access, which Coinbase absolutely dominates in total fee revenue, or fee maximization, which will be something like maybe a two token model, like Frax ETH, or other smaller providers that you kind of have to go a little further out on the risk curve for, or decentralization, like something like a rocket pool, or quite frankly, even staked eth.
00:09:01.986 - 00:09:16.030, Speaker A: So we see these. There's just going to be a distribution of preferences. But I really do think that the next wave of users are going to favor the ease of access piece. So kind of my two cent on the matter. Sam, who do you got in the hot seater? Cool throw on this week.
00:09:16.100 - 00:10:16.962, Speaker B: So mine might be a little bit controversial, I'm not sure, depending upon what people's opinion is on the matter, but I think everyone by now probably knows. There was a lido draft proposal on the forum basically saying that we should return protocol revenue, or at least a portion of, I think it was 30% to 50% of the actual take rate, to the Dow treasury on the forum last week. And there was some suspicious timing with a couple of tweets from notable figures in the industry, one being Andrew Kang and the other being Hal press. Andrew actually tweeted about an LDO proposal an hour before there was any proposal live, and then four or five minutes later, how press started tweeting about the proposal. So maybe he has forum post notifications on and just saw it really fast, or someone texted him and said, hey, there's a new proposal up. And the account that made the post was created that day and was only live for like 8 hours before making the proposal. So just some sketchy things going on in governance land.
00:10:16.962 - 00:10:38.170, Speaker B: Feels like kind of an attempt to get a last little bit of exit liquidity to sell into for people with big bags of LDO looking to exit their position. So not saying that's exactly what happened, but it definitely doesn't look good. And it was enough to warrant a hot seat in my view. So not sure if you guys have any opinions on that or if you guys have any thoughts in general about the proposal that we saw.
00:10:38.240 - 00:11:04.078, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely seems like some peak bear market fuckery. No liquidity, quick forum post, get a pump, get out of the asset. I mean, I don't know. It's tough to say if that was actually what happened to be fully transparent here we all have governance tractors on. I get an email a second. There's a forum post in a series of different assets in their governance forum. So it's possible.
00:11:04.078 - 00:11:34.710, Speaker A: It's possible, of course, tweeting before the thing happens that of course isn't possible. So I don't know if maybe it was referencing a different proposal. Hard to say, but definitely a little sketchy. The better mentality to take in this space, I've kind of found is if it can be manipulated, it will be manipulated. That's kind of how I view a lot of the active address activity. We tend to see these crazy pumps and active addresses on super cheap chains. Like, okay, so it's very easy to increase the number of daily active addresses.
00:11:34.710 - 00:11:41.802, Speaker A: I don't know, just kind of like a general framework I have when assessing certain things in the space, and I think this kind of falls into that category.
00:11:41.946 - 00:11:57.966, Speaker E: I mean, maybe alpress is using Govhub, our new governance aggregator, blockers research. Little silent chill right there. No, I think it's deservedly so to be on the hot seat. I don't think it's just a coincidence.
00:11:58.158 - 00:11:59.826, Speaker C: It might not be specifically the two.
00:11:59.848 - 00:12:34.622, Speaker E: People that you mentioned, Sam. We don't know exactly the exact actions that were taking place, but all we know is a random account went on the lido forum that was created 7 hours before the proposal was even made. So it wasn't even by someone that's known in the lido community that actually has some cloud can actually get a proposal like that passed. Just some random account posted this how press just so happens to see it within four minutes. Maybe using that's, that's great if he. But our product is great. And we actually were talking about that Lido proposal like three minutes before the moment that it came in.
00:12:34.622 - 00:13:09.454, Speaker E: I think, Ren, you saw it within a minute of the posting. So I'm not exactly sure how you saw it, probably gohub, but really cool that we were able to catch on, discuss it ourselves. But it's nefarious activities. However you see it, you could tell that the person that made the proposal doesn't actually really know much about Lido because they were saying that the Dow itself had 17 and a half years of Runway, which took into account the native token in a treasury. It was a really bad proposal overall. It doesn't make sense today for Lido to pass revenue back to their token holders. It was the poor proposal overall.
00:13:09.454 - 00:13:21.542, Speaker E: And overall, the moment it got posted and it got announced on Twitter, it was the talk of the market in the local high. And whoever posted it found their engineered exit liquidity.
00:13:21.606 - 00:14:15.294, Speaker D: I think one thing I think about is that when I first found out about the shenanigans, I was like, okay, yeah, that seems like kind of scammy, low key, legal. But then I thought about it a bit more. How is this different from one of those big Chad Phi hedge funds that specialize in shorting stocks and then releasing a hit piece about how some companies books are completely messed up? It feels kind of similar. You accumulate a position, whether that's long or short, and then you've released some information. Obviously, in the case of a short fund, with the intention of manipulating the stock price or having some effect on the stock price, and then using that as exit liquidity, chances are in cradfi, they probably have a slightly longer term outlook on kind of short the stock, rather than this Lido case where it just pumped and dumped in like 2 hours. But that was just an interesting comparison that I thought of.
00:14:15.332 - 00:14:54.598, Speaker B: That is interesting, and I think that's a fair comparison to make. I guess just with the one caveat being like the lido, one is actually trying to change fundamentally how the token accrues value, whereas the example of an equity research shop that's shorting, I guess they're kind of evaluating facts and not changing the actual structure of the company. But I think it's a fair comparison to make and something I hadn't thought about, but we did. Actually, Dan and I hopped on Bell curve for a roundup this week. So if you're more interested to hear about the whole IDA situation in depth, you guys can check that one out on Apple or Spotify, but effort. I'll kick it over to you for your hot seat or cool throw.
00:14:54.614 - 00:15:49.414, Speaker E: Yeah, my hot seat. Today I have stepping the sneaker NFT application that was pretty big heading into the end of this bull cycle. So they announced this morning that they integrated Apple Pay into their App Store application and it said the users will not need a crypto wallet to purchase step in sneaker nfts. Instead of needing a crypto wallet to, I guess, deposit USDC into to buy a sneaker NFT, you're actually able to use Apple Pay to buy something called spark credits. And then ten spark credits equals one USDC. And then I guess you use these spark credits and I'm assuming I haven't used the app yet, to be fully honest. But I'm guessing you sign in using like, google or some type of web two identification system and you are able to buy your sneaker nfts and it's like attached to that web two account, which I think in general is a cool innovation.
00:15:49.414 - 00:16:18.850, Speaker E: I'm not saying that it's not, but the reason why I thought they're on the hot seat today is because they use things like this in their Twitter thread. We thank Apple for their continued support for step in since their launch in 2021. They called it a monumental milestone. Step in has like 40 daily active users. Apple doesn't probably even know what step in is. All Stefan did was use their Apple Pay SDK and got a payment provider to actually accept them. So Apple didn't support stepping Apple Pay.
00:16:18.850 - 00:16:56.846, Speaker E: Nobody cares about Stefan's sneaker nfts and their 40 active users. This is like a protocol. In 2017, 2018, and as recently as Avalanche earlier this year, who I also put on the hot seat for a very similar reason, saying that they have an AWS as their partner, it's like, no, just because AWS is running nodes or made it easy to do, like one click node setup of your layer one blockchain, that doesn't mean AWS partnered with you. They're just providing a service because they're in the business of making money. There's no way Stepin was supported by Apple. Apple doesn't know who Stepan is. I'm just sick of protocols, especially in a bear market.
00:16:56.846 - 00:17:06.050, Speaker E: I'm just like the protocols you're trying to use again, engineered exit liquidity. Because I guarantee you the moment this came out, some people that were in the know probably dumped their tokens.
00:17:07.270 - 00:17:07.634, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:07.672 - 00:17:29.766, Speaker E: So that's why Stefan's on the hot seat. Regardless of it. I think this is where crypto has to go to, though. It has to be like, we got to abstract away the crypto wallet. I think applications will need to have built in wallets so you don't require someone to download an additional application like Coinbase or metamask. I like where this is going, but I'm just like, over this space hyping things that aren't partnerships.
00:17:29.878 - 00:17:58.118, Speaker A: I echo that sentiment there on that last bit, but I'm curious, what does this look like on the on chain side? Does anybody know? So if you log into the app and have some control based on your username and password over some assets that are on chain, I'm imagining that there's just like one wallet on chain that holds all these assets and then some database off chain that kind of maps username and password to NFT. That's my guess. Does anybody know if that's how it works?
00:17:58.204 - 00:18:28.814, Speaker B: I'm actually not too sure how it works under the hood, but I'd imagine it's exactly that, with the on chain information actually serving as kind of like the escrow account for all of the users. And I'd imagine you'd be able to send these NFTs to a separate like that you actually control on chain. So that's how, I guess, but I don't know. I strong agree, though. Effort. These partnerships are pretty exhausting, and they're really not partnerships at all. So I was actually trying to think of some pros on this.
00:18:28.814 - 00:19:04.470, Speaker B: And I guess just at the end of the day, you need to make sure that there's people willing to spend more money in the app than people who expect to just extract money out. And that's not what we've seen from stepping to date. And I find it hard to believe that people are going to want to spend thousands of dollars on a pair of sneakers just to extract a few dollars a day, and then also reinvest all those profits into a new pair of digital sneakers. That seems a little far fetched. It feels more like the means of the end is to make money. So, not too bullish stepping, but also think it's cool that they're trying to go mainstream with the Apple integration.
00:19:04.550 - 00:19:54.730, Speaker D: I think one pro for me, at least over the past few months, is that there's been a lot of developments in the mobile world for crypto. Right. First, Uniswap got their wallet approved, and then I think Axie Infinity also got approved on the App Store. And now step ed. And I think there's, like, a decent amount of protocols for the next big upgrade, Dydx, for example, for V four, they're going to build out a full fledged iOS and Android app. And it seems like crypto is really trying to make that push into mobile, which at the end of the day is what I feel the majority of people will access or at least interact with crypto on, not like a laptop or a desktop. And I think another interesting thing about step end also a full disclaimer, I didn't partake in step in the bull market, but step in especially like buying that spark credits seems very pay to win.
00:19:54.730 - 00:20:33.330, Speaker D: And pay to win is like a huge category in traditional gaming that makes a lot of money and is actually sustainable for game developers rather than a play to earn, which is kind of like what we saw during the boom market between Axie infinity and all of these other games that just continuously issued all of their native tokens and they got dumped into the ground once the market kind of died down. But pay to win is a lot more sustainable for business model and I would love to see more games or sort of more protocols like step in, integrate that into the app using new developments such as integrating the Apple Pay or launching on mobile.
00:20:33.410 - 00:20:51.740, Speaker A: If you take the step in piece out of it. How do you guys feel about this semi on chain reality that they're augmenting for their users? You still have this web two feel, but in reality you are transacting on chain just like through a proxy. Is that a good thing?
00:20:52.110 - 00:20:52.506, Speaker C: I guess.
00:20:52.528 - 00:20:55.050, Speaker A: Is that a good thing? Is that bringing people on chain?
00:20:56.350 - 00:21:02.446, Speaker E: To me right now, this industry just needs to get people on chain when they don't even need to be on chain, or they don't know that they're on chain, I should say.
00:21:02.468 - 00:21:02.894, Speaker A: So.
00:21:03.012 - 00:21:21.974, Speaker E: This web 2.5 feel, I think we're gradually going to get there when there's better infrastructure, when signing in with Ethereum, where everyone in the world has like an Ans or something, we'll get there. It's going to probably take five to ten years plus. But I think this is a good thing. So I don't mean to put them.
00:21:22.012 - 00:21:23.090, Speaker C: On the hot seat.
00:21:23.250 - 00:21:47.822, Speaker E: I do think there's some innovation here and I do think this is like the right way. This space needs ahead in the future, at least in the short to midterm. So I like that. And I think that's really all that matters. It's just getting more people on chain interacting, feeling more comfortable with using a decentralized application, whether or not they know it's decentralized or not. Ultimately us nerds care that it's decentralized. We care about this cool innovation in tech.
00:21:47.822 - 00:22:04.014, Speaker E: But the average user, even in ten years, even if crypto is mainstream and managing billions and trillions of dollars, most average people still won't even know. And that's beautiful, though. They shouldn't have to know. It should just work and feel the exact same way as web two effort.
00:22:04.062 - 00:22:35.534, Speaker B: Do you happen to know if these spark credits are more like Fortnite's v bucks and that they're not redeemable once you buy them? Or an ERC 20 type token once you buy them with dollars, is that pretty much just. That's what they are. You have to buy sneakers with them in order to redeem them? Or is there like a way out of those? Because that'd be interesting. Because I know gift card industries make a shit ton of money just because people leave a couple dollars on every card, and then you've got a million people with a card and it adds up pretty quick. So that'd be kind of interesting.
00:22:35.652 - 00:23:02.806, Speaker E: Yeah, I honestly don't know the answer, Sam. In their medium post, they don't say whether or not it's an ERC 20. They just keep calling them spark credits and that the smallest unit of spark credits is one. Just like thinking about it like every other ERC 20 out there, pretty much. You can go as small denomination as possible and send that from wallet to wallet. The fact that they're saying, like, the smallest denomination is one, they're calling it credits. They're not saying it's related to an ERC 20.
00:23:02.806 - 00:23:07.442, Speaker E: I'm assuming that it's not redeemable or you can't transfer that to other users.
00:23:07.506 - 00:23:13.990, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. That's what I would probably expect, too. Anyways, Dan, who you got in the hot seat or cool throne?
00:23:14.070 - 00:23:49.362, Speaker A: Drum roll, please. To no one's surprise curve, the llama lending protocol and CRV USD stablecoin is a masterclass in mechanism design. This thing is absolutely beautiful. I'm not prepared to say it's flawless because there are a ton of parameters that definitely need to be optimized as time goes on. But the early testing looks pretty damn good. I mean, right now there's only one listed collateral. It's staked Frax EtH, and that's the yield accruing version of Frax's liquid staking token.
00:23:49.362 - 00:24:38.926, Speaker A: And it launched with a $10 million debt ceiling. It's currently at just over 7 million in less than a week since launching. So we've already seen an initial pretty good onslaught of demand. But the key innovation, really, with the lending protocol is around the liquidation mechanism. So if you think about makerdao compound aave, our largest DeFi lending protocols today, they all use what are called hard liquidations to protect the protocol's solvency. And what a hard liquidation is, is at a specific health factor, which is like a modified version of the loan to value ratio, the loan becomes under collateralized. At that point, the collateral is auctioned off or sold off for the debt asset, and the debt is repaid on behalf of the borrower.
00:24:38.926 - 00:25:19.182, Speaker A: So the borrower actually loses their collateral. They're only left with the open loan that they have, but that is actually closed out by an arbitrageur or an mev bot on their behalf. And what this results in is the protocol stays solvent. And we've seen hard liquidations are very effective at doing this, but it leaves the borrower without their collateral. And so curve kind of set out to improve this exact piece. And so they created what is called a soft liquidation method. And basically what that does is instead of having that one critical number where your loan becomes under collateralized and you get hard liquidated, there's actually a range of liquidation.
00:25:19.182 - 00:26:21.826, Speaker A: So it's like, over this one period. So instead of, let's say your loan was liquidated at an ETH price of $1,600, now, instead of hitting 1600 and being screwed at like between 16 51,700, your collateral gets slowly shifted out of the collateral asset and into a stable coin. So therefore, when the price moves below the liquidation range, you're fully in stablecoins and out of the volatile collateral asset, and your debt is always less than the amount of stable coins that is now your collateral. So this design basically keeps you in that over collateralized state. And so there's a couple of key unlocks here. So, first of all, as the price of collateral is falling, you're actually buying stablecoins and selling eth, which is pretty the opposite of a traditional amm, which would be the exact opposite of that scenario. So it gives you this ability to protect borrower collateral.
00:26:21.826 - 00:27:20.342, Speaker A: And that's really the big unlock here, is you can not have to worry about a sharp downswing in price completely wrecking you. But there are trade offs. Like there's no free lunge in Defi, and the trade off here is that, yes, you save collateral, but on the way back up, you actually regain your collateral. And as you're regaining collateral, instead of regaining 100%, you actually lose a little bit, that little bit of collateral is essentially paid to the arbitrage for arbing off your transactions. And so as the price recovers, you actually gain your collateral back. So not only does it protect you from being full liquidated, but if the price fully recovers above your original investment price, or above the upper bound of your liquidation range, I should say you get the ability to withdraw the entirety of your collateral minus a small portion. So that small portion today, we're still actively testing this in production and protocol.
00:27:20.342 - 00:28:14.794, Speaker A: Founder Michael Egerov actually has a little over a million dollar loan out, and he's been took out an insanely degen loan for the sake of testing the thing. So that's a very chad move, I got to say. But it's an 89% LTV loan with a range of ten bands, so a super long range, it's the maximum range length, and a very high LTV loan. So it's going to get liquidated very soon, right? And over about four to five days of being in soft liquidation. So it's loan actively being arbed between collateral and stablecoin, it only lost a little over 1% of his collateral, so that when it recovers, he would get 99% of his collateral back and never had to worry about hard liquidation. That is a huge unlock for DFI. It's a little early to tell and get all excited about this, but it's hard not to think that this will be the new standard for how DFI loans get taken out.
00:28:14.794 - 00:28:48.262, Speaker A: It just is a better user experience, and there's a lot of different ways to take this. And I know the guys here are probably super tired about hearing me talk about this, considering we have a report launching on May 26 that goes over this. So I've been doing a deep dive on it for a little over a week, and our morning calls have been polluted with curve USD talk. But the stablecoin is a whole nother piece. A lot of very interesting mechanisms there. There's a couple of different ways the protocol generates revenue from this. I mean, all in, it's just a true masterclass in mechanism design.
00:28:48.262 - 00:29:25.454, Speaker A: I think the interest rate curve is probably the most exciting thing. It takes like, one equilibrium rate and modifies that rate by the current CRV USD price and the balance of debt in the system. And that, just like we've never seen anything like that. It's similar to an ave lending rate mechanism, where at a certain point the rate increases to protect the protocol, but instead of being based around a utilization rate, that's really based around the price of the stablecoin, which is pretty interesting too. So some cool stability mechanisms there we probably don't have time to get into, but net, it's really hard not to be bullish on curve as a protocol.
00:29:25.502 - 00:29:40.422, Speaker D: Right now without diving in too deep into the mechanisms. I just wanted to ask one question, Dan. Does the mechanism of llama kind of open the door for under collateralized lending in some form, or not yet?
00:29:40.476 - 00:30:29.110, Speaker A: That's a great question, and I actually asked Stannie about this in our interview. If we could get to a place of under collateralized lending with using lens as a decentralized identity solution. I'll let you guys hear the answer yourselves in the interview, but I don't know. I don't think so, to be honest, because you still need the issue with under collateralized lending is there's no recourse against the borrower if they never pay back the loan. And so this doesn't really solve that. It just gives you a better ux, and you can really max out risk parameters. Right? Ave doesn't let you borrow against staked Frax ETH at an 89% LTV because it's a risky asset and they need to worry about Dex liquidity to liquidate that into, which is a whole nother ballpark issue.
00:30:29.110 - 00:30:45.418, Speaker A: But yeah, it just really lets you beef out the risk parameters and not have to worry about that hard liquidation. Now, Kavit, there are still scenarios where you do hit hard liquidation, but they're pretty hard to meet that criteria as of right now.
00:30:45.584 - 00:30:48.620, Speaker E: Dan, I'm not sure if this question makes sense, but.
00:30:50.610 - 00:30:51.854, Speaker C: Does the time in.
00:30:51.892 - 00:31:01.918, Speaker E: Soft liquidation compound your collateral erosion for when you get back into, like, a non soft liquidated state?
00:31:02.084 - 00:31:44.186, Speaker A: Great question. Yes, but there are multiple factors there. So the band range, so the number of bands or the length from upper bound and lower bound of the liquidation range impacts it as well. But yes, every arb transaction, if you are in liquidation range during an ARB transaction, you're getting your collateral converted between stablecoin and collateral in either direction as well. And so, again, that's when the erosion happens. But what's interesting is this is an Amm instead of just a pool holding assets, and so it costs transaction fees to participate in swapping the assets in the pool for the arbitragers.
00:31:44.218 - 00:31:44.558, Speaker E: Right?
00:31:44.644 - 00:32:30.394, Speaker A: And so 100% of the swap fees flow to borrowers and only the borrowers in the active range. So if you're getting your collateral eroded, you're also the only people accruing swap fees. And so that's kind of how this nets out because the swap fees are quite high. It's 0.6%, which that is very above average for DFI. But it's because of the pricing invariant used by the Amm that it's still profitable to be running these transactions as an arbitrager. So the swap fee kind of acts as like this balancing mechanism of kind of slowing down the number of arbs so that capital erosion, while also still keeping the pool healthy and ensuring that paying the borrowers for the erosion, that's happening as well.
00:32:30.394 - 00:32:39.200, Speaker A: So it's like this crazy balance mechanism, and every time you peel back another layer, you just end up figuring out that this thing is, again, a masterclass in mechanism design.
00:32:39.730 - 00:32:48.260, Speaker E: So one last serious question about curved USD. Who do you think is going to raise the debt ceiling first, curve USD or the US government?
00:32:51.510 - 00:32:55.726, Speaker A: Oh my God, that's an incredible question. Let's go curve Dow. Let's go curve.
00:32:55.758 - 00:32:58.014, Speaker E: Now talking like a true token holder.
00:32:58.062 - 00:33:09.938, Speaker B: I feel like curve really missed out on some good marketing material with all this talk of hard versus soft liquidations. To be completely honest, I feel like there's a good joke to be made in there. But Dan, what's new with the atom accelerator?
00:33:10.034 - 00:33:41.186, Speaker A: Absolutely got to give a shout out to our incredible sponsor. If you're a developer looking to kind of break into the industry or look for a new home in the industry, the atom economic zone is for you. It's the premier place to build in crypto right now. It's offering interchange security that you can launch a chain without having to bootstrap your validator set. You're inheriting the economic security of the atom token itself. You got IBC, which gives you the flexibility of interoperability. And neutron is a great example of why these things are important.
00:33:41.186 - 00:34:22.634, Speaker A: They just launched, and now you have this permissionless smart contract platform to go build anything on. This is likely to be like the defi hub of the atom economic zone, and it's going to be exciting to see all the development there. And that's on top of the fact that liquid staking is starting to take off, which inherently makes defi more exciting. Again, we've seen this across all of Ethereum defi as well. And lastly, one of the things that the cosmos ecosystem has needed for quite some time was a native stablecoin that can be relied on. And USDC is actively in testing, minting through noble, and that is going to be like this last. You know, you have liquid staking and a native stablecoin.
00:34:22.634 - 00:34:46.514, Speaker A: Plus this permissionless place to build smart contracts. I really do expect to see a DeFi summer level of activity out of the cosmos ecosystem. And if you have an idea that you think deserves a grant from the atom accelerator, please do reach out. We'll be sure to put their link in the description. And they're currently giving grants from $10,000 to $1 million. And that's on a rolling basis as well. So a rolling monthly basis.
00:34:46.514 - 00:35:17.234, Speaker A: So if you're a builder again, this is the place for you to be checking out right now. So be sure to check out the link in the description. And now we'll jump over to the interview with Stannie, the CEO and founder of Ave Companies. All right, everyone, we are joined today by Stannie, the founder and CEO of Ave Companies. Stannie, it's really exciting to have you on. You've been around the space for what feels like forever. You've been building Ave since 2017, so that's over six years ago, which is about three and a half lifetimes in crypto years.
00:35:17.234 - 00:35:42.390, Speaker A: So we really appreciate you coming on to talk to us. We got a pretty exciting conversation today around lens and Ave. Both have some pretty exciting developments going on in their respective ecosystems. But before we jump into that, I'd love to kind of just dive into your thoughts on the state of crypto today. Can you just talk to a little bit about the evolution of the industry? How has it changed for the better over the last few years? And is there anything that you feel has changed for the worse?
00:35:42.470 - 00:37:10.194, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, Dan, for the introduction as well. Definitely feeling old now, but I usually try to measure the progress of blockchain or crypto or web three or whatever anyone wants to call it, by a way of trying to measure and understand the adoption compared to other technologies. And I think something very comparable recently is that there's been a lot of excitement around AI, and I had to bring AI very early into this discussion, but I think it's relevant because, for example, AI has been a field where we've seen decades of work and maybe more recently, decade and a half more intensively. And when we look at the overall crypto space and the underlying blockchain technology and different use cases. So we've existed roughly a bit more than ten years, depending how you calculate. I mean, Ethereum pretty much. If you look at if Ethereum was founded in 2013, that's pretty much ten years going to be during this year, and then bitcoin even few years earlier.
00:37:10.194 - 00:39:08.166, Speaker C: So it just showcases how early we're in the space, but the newer the technology is usually it has faster adoption curve. And the reason for that is that a technology might rely upon something that it's anchoring into a preexisting technology. Example is that some of these social media applications, they have significant increasing growth and adoption because there's already underlying technologies. There's the Internet, there's 5g, there's mobile phones and a bunch of other stuff. And the way blockchain is approaching is that it kind of provides a completely different kind of a mindset and a platform of how the future Internet is going to be built and the future applications are going to build in a way where we kind of like, I use the concept of redecentralization because intranet was built in a very decentralized way, went into more centralized hats to make it more user friendlier, more adoption, and now we have this kind of like idea of really decentralizing everything we have online. So I think personally, because we're building everything pretty much from the scratch and we're still dealing with scalability challenges. And I don't think there are challenges, they're more of scalability progress, because we started with how much security we need to actually secure a blockchain based infrastructure, and now we're looking into, now that we have the base layer, how much security we need and how we apply scalability and inherit something like Ethereum layer twos and build that path towards more wider user adoption.
00:39:08.166 - 00:39:42.950, Speaker C: So we're in the right path, but because everything starts very much from the bottom on the whole stack, it's definitely slower progress than if you compare some other technologies. But still, we've been here for 15 so years comparing to some of the technologies that are getting a lot of traction. They've been around as a concept and continuous progress for a few decades. So that's kind of where we are from a technological perspective with crypto.
00:39:43.290 - 00:40:28.738, Speaker A: Awesome. So you really highlight that scalability is like the challenge that the industry has to work around today. And you often hear people mention like, hey, crypto really hasn't found its killer application that onboarded that next wave of users. But it almost sounds to like, I don't want to put words in your mouth here, but it sounds like you're referencing. The reason that is, is because we haven't seen that scalability that you need in order to onboard those users in the first place. So even if the app existed, it's almost like this chicken or the egg problem to some degree. If you look at DeFi today, do you think that we still need to see this? Where it's come over the last couple of years is huge, right? Like the on chain liquidity was kind of born, which fueled the growth of DeFi lending.
00:40:28.738 - 00:40:39.066, Speaker A: And then you saw these new primitives get formed around that. Is DeFi still missing some of these newer applications, or is scalability really the issue within DeFi as well?
00:40:39.168 - 00:42:16.994, Speaker C: Well, interestingly, in the first place, bitcoin kind of tried to solve one part of financial transactioning with the use of blockchain, basically selling value between peers. And with Ethereum, we also got a kind of like a more programmable layer on a financial ledger to decentralize, which basically means that whatever program financial transaction you can imagine that could be built on a blockchain can actually now happen because of the concept of ethereum virtual machine. And I think regarding kind of like the idea of where DeFi is at this point, I think we've been filling a lot of gaps over the past years. We figured out how to exchange value in a very efficient way, how to supply liquidity and create the market for many of these assets that are created and secured by the blockchain. And with the lending and borrowing stablecoins, we even expand that usability for financial ecosystem. And I do think DeFi works. If you can build something, I usually say in a way that if you build something that is better, faster, stronger finance, then it makes sense to use DeFi.
00:42:16.994 - 00:43:21.226, Speaker C: So if because of this interest finance and many of these protocols that you're using, you're able to get liquidity or attract liquidity where you couldn't do before, or if you can do transactioning with counterparties that you couldn't do before, and brings you new reach, that brings also access, and that's better finance. And because it's transparent, you don't need to necessarily trust a single point or a centralized provider that creates confidence on transacting beyond your normal reach. And I think that's the whole point of blockchain, because it creates this kind of like a democratic platform for transaction. But I think about the killer app and what that could be. I think it's more of like that. For example, Ethereum or crypto as a general, I think is a platform. So it's kind of like a gaming console.
00:43:21.226 - 00:44:27.410, Speaker C: Think about it as like a Nintendo or PlayStation. You have this machine that works well and you play as long as there's some interesting things happening or you have some sort of interesting upside to it. So when you look at the history of Ethereum and everything that is happening in crypto, you have this kind of like a social element involved into it. And a lot of the use cases, they are quite limited in the sense that you might need that lower cost component and scalability. But there's a lot of social things happening in crypto. So people were chasing yield back in Defi summer, people minting nfts and buying monkey pictures during the NFT summer, and now people are chasing also meme coins. So these are like social events and games that are happening on chain.
00:44:27.410 - 00:45:35.618, Speaker C: And as you have more scalability, you have more scalable infrastructure. You can create different kinds of games. And by games I mean it's not just like I use games and use cases as a synonym. And the reason I'm calling them games, because they do have this component of exploration, discovery, satisfaction, and the social component as well. So there's a lot of things that has happened in the past years that brought people here, but we could do much more if the infrastructure allows us to do. And for DeFI specifically, I think we're in a good state where a lot of these protocols that have been built over the years, they're actually starting to show resiliency. The beauty of DFI and web three is that it's purely an open space, open design space, so you can come and build something very fascinating with a relatively small team anywhere from the world, and empower a lot of people who are interacting with decentralized finance.
00:45:35.618 - 00:46:35.958, Speaker C: But at the same time, to get more adoption, we need to build resilient protocols that actually can hold large amount of funds without actually getting compromised or having issues. And that's the kind of like the hardest part for DFI, is that whatever you're creating to secure 100 million over the long term, you should be able to secure with the same design, maybe hundreds of billions as well. So that's the kind of like a challenge that DeFI has. And I think for the future, what we have to think about is that now that we have this interesting trustless execution environment on decentralized finance, what we can actually build on top that isn't necessarily existing traditional finance, and could actually be very empowering because we have this system that we've built with decentralized finance.
00:46:36.054 - 00:47:09.160, Speaker B: Yeah, that all makes a lot of sense to me. And I love that analogy used between blockchains and gaming consoles. That's not something I had thought of before, and I feel like it's pretty perfect, honestly. But I did want to ask you a question. Something that kind of got resurfaced last week when someone posted something the Lido forums to share revenue with token stakers. There's one camp that's like, yes, that's great, gives yield utility to the token. But then the other camp is like, well, we actually need to reinvest the protocol profits into maybe redeploying on other chains, an insurance fund offering new products, whatever it is.
00:47:09.160 - 00:47:20.102, Speaker B: I wanted to get your take on whether or not various protocols should be sharing revenue with token stakers, or if you think that money needs to be reinvested into growth.
00:47:20.166 - 00:48:42.260, Speaker C: Yeah. This boils down to the question is that what kind of functions a dow should have, and it's a wide range topic, actually. So we've seen dows that have different kinds of units, those units get allocations of capital, and they're part of the whole, kind of like a bigger dow. Like you have subdaos, then you have a team, which is basically part of that dow and building for the protocol, having a growth measures for the protocol, and a bunch of other things. So kind of like, we see also dows that act like a company almost. I personally think that the layer of the dows should be very thin, because end of the day, that what we are building are public goods, meaning that you really want to mitigate all the potential risks that involve that protocol to operate without issues. And I think once we basically have protocols that are sufficiently working well, they're resilient, maybe their risk parameters are managed pretty well and can be automated down the line.
00:48:42.260 - 00:50:18.994, Speaker C: One of the risks that still exists is the kind of like governance risk from the people itself. So recently saw the incident with tornado cash with the Dow governance attack. But that's the kind of a surface that we have to limit ourselves from as well. So how to reduce that human risk out of the system and have a functional public good? And I think that's where having kind of like a thin layer Dow layer, where you have a functional protocol and the Dow effectively allocates capital to maintain the protocol, have some fixes, pay for security contributors, some small measures, but effectively, it should be kind of like a thin layer and everything else from that. So if that public good actually is really beneficial, creates revenue, I mean, avidao creates revenue annually from 25 to 50 million, depending on the fluctuations annually, meaning that it's one of the rarest dows that are actually producing net positive profits after all the costs associated for paying for contributors. In that case, you could actually allow some sort of mechanisms where the token holders can maybe take additional risk, stake the assets, and get part of that profit share by actively contributing with their assets into the protocol. Not necessarily passively, because that's another story.
00:50:18.994 - 00:50:52.986, Speaker C: So I believe that maybe in that case, you could have an interesting opportunity there. So yeah, I come from a perspective where I think a dow shouldn't do everything that it could. Maybe that's the case in the beginning, but down the line you really follow a path where a protocol becomes a public good and the dow kind of becomes like a trust from analogy there, where it just allocates capital and has less and less governance votes. Down the line.
00:50:53.088 - 00:51:19.730, Speaker A: Really interesting perspective there, Stani. I think this is going to be a conversation that stays in the limelight for the foreseeable future, honestly. But I want to kind of drive the conversation a little more towards lens. But before diving specifically into this one application, I want to get your views from a high level perspective around decentralized social media as a whole. How does it benefit the end users to use decentralized social media compared to maybe the web? Two alternatives?
00:51:19.810 - 00:52:39.070, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it goes back to the previous conversation that we started building an Internet that is really decentralized, so anyone can connect, and you have this idea of you can self host a server, connect into this big infrastructure of Internet slowly. What we realized is that it's not really efficient to, or it's not actually even easy to get everyone online and share information. You could read it easily. So if you have web browser, you could easily browse the Internet. So as a read mode it works pretty well. But once you want to express something and you want to create content, share ideas, that is where you kind of have to figure the way that how do you actually contribute, whatever that discussion might be online. And that's where actually bigger social media platforms and web two was somehow built where you had actually ways to create content, share information and share links.
00:52:39.070 - 00:53:50.040, Speaker C: They gridded slash dode is a good example of that. And then other platforms and bigger social media platforms today have the very same pattern because they provide the usability in exchange for, I would say kind of like more control over your social capital. So your profile, your follower base, and what you actually see in the feed, and that's very little where you have actually control and benefits. So the way we approach actually social media and what we did with lens is that we were looking into those different kinds of artifacts or features. What is happening in online networking. So typically you create a profile, then you might follow other profiles that are interesting for you, and then you basically share whatever you find and amplify content to your own follower base. And then you create content.
00:53:50.040 - 00:54:47.838, Speaker C: And then we took some of these social media primitives and turned them into protocol guarantees by using smart contracts and using the blockchain. So for example, when you create a profile on lens, that profile is secured by the blockchain. And if you follow other users, that follow graph is also secured by the blockchain. And these are protocol guarantees. So you can actually choose make a normal database follow as well. But basically what we want to provide to users is that they actually have an access control into their online presence, however they want to do that. And then it's up to the applications that are building on top of the lens protocol to actually decide which bunch of these features.
00:54:47.838 - 00:56:34.490, Speaker C: Because the lens stack, it consists of that on chain component, but there's also a significant off chain component. For example, the recent, kind of like an optimistic scaling solution that we launched Boka, which actually creates blockchain transactions, but stores them on a data availability layer, which is verified by whoever wants to run a verifier, and then also other off chain components if you don't want to actually store any data on that data availability layer or on chain. So it's basically a full hybrid stack. And what's interesting here is that it's up to the applications and then users to choose what they actually want and need and reflect the user experience. But the biggest benefit for users is that now the kind of like our dynamics change between the platforms to a bit more user centric. And that means that if you as a user have oversight of your profile and your follower graph, and it's not actually anymore stored in a platform, let's say owned by a social media company, what it actually means is that you have now the choice and portability to take your followers and go to another experience, or even use an alternative algorithm. So because it's open, it also means that anyone can compute and create algorithms for discovery, finding content, finding peers to total in a more open way.
00:56:34.490 - 00:57:07.454, Speaker C: So it democratizes the access to create these algorithms and also provide to the user as well. So it changes a lot of those dynamics that hopefully are helpful. And because you're tapping into the same user base, hopefully what we're thinking is that it's more easier to bootstrap a social media application because you could use the previous user base and kind of like attract without them needing to create a new account, because you have that portability by default.
00:57:07.582 - 00:57:34.046, Speaker B: Yeah, that's super interesting. You got to think that'll really push kind of the innovation at the front end side of social media to kind of the next level, considering how easy it is to move your data from one to the next. So love to hear that. Before we get into Momoka, the DA solution that you guys unveiled recently, I did want to get just your quick thoughts on the hardships of building on Polygon, if any, that you've experienced by trying to scale social media on web.
00:57:34.068 - 00:58:53.400, Speaker C: Three rails yeah, I think Polygon is a great option for some of the artifacts that we have in the lens ecosystem and the protocol. So for example, storing a profile makes a lot of sense in terms of the security you want to apply. So whenever it comes to a blockchain, there's always a component of scale and the cost of scale and that security. So in terms of polygon, there is a certain amount of transactions that you can actually submit into the POS chain, but our goal is to actually provide the users choice. So they should be able to choose in which networks they are using to secure their profile and also their namespace as well. So when it comes to actually transactions that are more frequent, and that's usually sharing content, which is basically amplification of content with the mirroring the creation of the content. Comments some of these applications, social media applications in web two, they experience at peak 2020, 5000 transactions per second.
00:58:53.400 - 01:00:22.206, Speaker C: And we're talking about something where you might find a block time where you could actually fit all those transactions, but because the amount is so great and blockchain, the way it works is that you have, let's say block time is 2 seconds for the synchronization. You still have a lot of data that gets queued. And with something like Momoka, you can take that big amount of data and just dump it directly to a data availability layers and it's agnostic. So you can choose where obviously rv is the main one now and verify that the data is submitted correctly. So it's actually like the way we describe building on polygon and also Momoka and everything that we have in the stack is that it's about applying the right ingredients and tools to what problem you're trying to solve. And you have to be very resource conscious when you're actually working with a blockchain, especially when you're dealing with non financial transactions, because that's where you have to think about, okay, so do I need a blockchain to secure, let's say, a profile? In most cases you do. For example, do I need a blockchain to create a post or a comment? In those cases, maybe data availability is enough as a solution.
01:00:22.206 - 01:00:31.030, Speaker C: So those kind of challenges come when you have a strong on chain component as well.
01:00:31.180 - 01:00:59.530, Speaker A: Okay, so one of the first thing that comes to my mind here is like the design decision between building in the Ethereum ecosystem through polygon, or the leveraging a high throughput chain, something like Solana. We've seen a recent rise in the number of high throughput chains around Sui and aptos as well. So I'm curious, just to get your take on, do you think it would make sense to build out a decentralized social media platform on one of these high throughput blockchains?
01:00:59.610 - 01:01:56.174, Speaker C: I think where they might be very useful is securing some of the elements. So for example, the tokenization part. So I think it's very valuable for a lens user to be able to choose where they actually want to mint their NFT. So the beauty of momokite is that it really kind of creates the actual content that the creator, the user wants to create. But you can actually decide after that moment has happened and you have created the content where it could be minted. So you could actually use similar, like a lazy mint fun feature where whoever likes the content can actually bring it on chain and mint copy of it, and then decide also on which chain that should happen. And I think that's where kind of like, it plays a big part of the tokenization aspect.
01:01:56.174 - 01:02:41.642, Speaker C: And I think all the nfTs, they don't need to really be minted on Ethereum. And there's going to be a moment at some point where we have a lot of layer twos settling on Ethereum. They're going to take a lot of block space. So at some point, even when the upgrades that are coming, even if the gas price is going down, at some point that demand is getting refilled. So we have to think about where this actually more consumer facing activity will go. And those chains will perfectly the same as Polygon will provide that pad. Ethereum will just become a bit unusable for the consumer perspective.
01:02:41.642 - 01:03:16.394, Speaker C: But then you have those layer twos and alternatively other layer ones where you can actually have that tokenization. So it's more about providing, as much as possible, flexibility for the user. Sorry, not just for the user, but also for the developers and letting them to choose. And whenever we build at Aba, we try to always think about how can we be less opinionated and how we can just leave the choice more for people who are going to use lens in the future.
01:03:16.512 - 01:03:42.610, Speaker B: Gotcha. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think it'd be super helpful if you could kind of describe to us what is a typical transaction look like for a user when they're using lens today and posting all that data to polygon versus what it'll actually look like once Momoka is fully integrated throughout the like, what is the trade off in security assumptions? But what is the benefit in terms of performance and user experience going to be?
01:03:42.680 - 01:04:38.790, Speaker C: Yeah, so the on chain transaction, when you are creating content on Polygon, you're creating a post, for example, you can say like GM, zero x research, I don't know, we're going to interview someone tomorrow and it's going to be huge. So create that post and you submit. So in the background, actually none of the transactions have gas neither. You need to sign. So that's done by a service called a dispatcher. So basically you could submit your own transaction, pay your gas sign in a very decent fashion, but in most cases it's not really needed because you're creating content, it's not a financial transaction. So you're using dispatcher to have a better ux.
01:04:38.790 - 01:05:21.134, Speaker C: So once you post, what happens in the user interfaces in many of these clients like Lancer, Orb or butterfly, what actually happens is that the content itself gets reflected to you right away. So as a user, you see the post there, so anyone can go and comment. So it's optimistically render it to you reflected on the clients. And then in the background what's happening is that the transaction is putting in the queue. And if there isn't any queue, it's submitted on chain, on polygon, if there's a queue.
01:05:21.182 - 01:05:22.674, Speaker A: So if there is like a huge.
01:05:22.712 - 01:06:18.850, Speaker C: Amount of transactions, I don't know, maybe something happens in the news and everyone is going commenting, some sort of event, you have a transaction spike and the block space isn't enough. So the other transactions will be submitted on the next block. So basically you have that transaction, once they're done, you actually have an on chain pause, which means that anyone can go and collect. And as a user, there's built in monetization in the lens protocol. So monetization isn't like the main thing about lens, but it's something that happened organically. And maybe because blockchain has this component of settling transactions. So if you can create content, you can also settle the actual payment transactions into getter.
01:06:18.850 - 01:07:08.466, Speaker C: And when you compare it actually to a Momoka transaction. So what happens there is that the process is very similar to create a transaction and it's actually a blockchain transaction. So that's created by the user, but then assigned by the user, and so called submitters submit the transaction itself. So what the submitter does, and currently there's only one submitter, but can be added more down the line as we have planned. The submitter simulates the transaction with a feature that is on the node network. So basically it's called eat call. It's simulated against the smart contract rules that are in the protocol.
01:07:08.466 - 01:08:16.538, Speaker C: So for example, if there's a rule that, and you're making a comment that only your follower can comment and someone creates a transaction and they're not following you, that transaction will fail basically, and the simulation will fail and the mobile cut transaction will fail. But if it's true, what happens then is that the transaction is simulated by the submitter and the submitter is submitting it through Bundler. It's basically a service provider that helps you aggregate data into data availability layers like RBEV. And that transaction is stored in RBEV and reflected on the user interfaces. And verifiers verify that the data format that was created and simulated was correct and it's stored in data availability layer. And also there is the verification proof that is stored there as well. So what actually happens here is a transaction that is reflected in less than a second and you can use the same idea.
01:08:16.538 - 01:08:59.270, Speaker C: So it's kind of like an optimistic data scaling solution. So you don't have execution and that's why the transaction cost is extremely low. So recently I was looking at the Momoka transactions. So we have 112,000 transactions and the total spend for all these transactions is $45. So it just tells you that the costs are similar to what you would be running AWS infrastructure. And that's the kind of like an idea there, because you don't need to use the execution that blockchain provides. You're basically using data availability for data scaling.
01:08:59.270 - 01:09:32.142, Speaker C: And you can actually use that because these are social media transactions and non financial transactions. And the same kind of model could apply to gaming as well. You just need to change what kind of data you're submitting and what are those things that has to be verified on that data format and that could be applicable there as well. I hope I didn't confuse too much because I tried to explain kind of like every single process that happens, it might be a lot of digest.
01:09:32.206 - 01:10:05.070, Speaker A: Data availability as a whole is already a confusing topic, so adding in the twist of decentralized social media definitely makes it more exciting. But I pulled up the memoka explorer here at Momoka lens XYZ. Congratulations first of all on crossing the 100,000 transactions mark. Currently 112 transactions have been processed through Momoka. And then there's this box here, it says total spent 45 dollarsfifty two cent, which equates to 0.4 cents per transaction. Excuse me, dollars per transaction.
01:10:05.070 - 01:10:19.780, Speaker A: Am I thinking it right that the users are therefore paying the transactions, obviously a very minimal fee, and that revenue, if you will, will flow to the submitter in this.
01:10:20.870 - 01:11:30.006, Speaker C: So this spent amount is actually what will be the cost for spending for the rv. So one of the data availability layers that is used, so Momoka can use technically whatever DA layer is created. So that could be, I don't know, even IPFS is a data availability layer to some extent. But RB has a pricing where if you want the data to be stored forever or like long period of time, I think they calculate it for 100 years, you pay a small cost for doing that. So basically that is the cost that is associated on storing on rv and having that guarantee there. But in the future, because as you see, there's one submitter, but anyone can run a verifier, even you can have a verifier that is running on runtime within the application of cleanser or any of these clients. But in the future you can create a network agreement between the verifiers.
01:11:30.006 - 01:12:20.406, Speaker C: So once you have certain amount of verifiers verified the same data, you can create some sort of incentive system there, and you can create some sort of incentive system on the submitter side. So when you actually have more submitters, they would have to have some sort of incentive of submitting and also some way of actually slashing if those conditions, if they're submitting something that isn't really aligned with what they should have submitted. So it's an interesting kind of like a concept of network agreement that you can do outside of the blockchain on whatever data you want these nodes to agree upon. It's very lightweight as well, so you can run this on a mobile phone to verify it.
01:12:20.508 - 01:12:41.418, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Yeah, that adds up. I see the celestial guys always tweeting out like look at the crazy place. I'm running a light node from now, so maybe we need to get some picks out of the AavE companies team from. Look where I'm running a verifier from now. I'm curious. So you mentioned that there could in the end state be multiple submitters.
01:12:41.418 - 01:12:55.246, Speaker A: What would be the incentive to come online and be a submitter, participate in this ecosystem? If I was spinning up my own decentralized social media platform, would I want to run a submitter as well?
01:12:55.368 - 01:14:18.640, Speaker C: Yeah, if you want to help to decentralize the world. But I think there could be actually like financial incentives as well, because the submitters are actually running a very important task of looking whatever data is created and submitting that into rv. So I think both for the verifier and submitter, there needs to be some sort of incentive mechanism down the line. I think now we can get few people to run the submitters, but they also need some sort of penalties as well if they don't produce, if they don't submit the correct data. But that's pretty much a network agreement with some sort of a slashing model that we're thinking about down the line once we know that the system worked. Momoka has been working quite well so far, so it supports posts and comments and mirroring. And now what we want to support in the future also is that if you create an on chain post, can also create a Momoka comment to have this kind of like a cross compass ability down the line.
01:14:18.640 - 01:14:34.690, Speaker C: We've wrote also a rust client for Momoka. So that's something that is coming up out as well and it's going to work faster. So yeah, there's definitely a lot of exciting things coming up.
01:14:34.760 - 01:15:07.754, Speaker B: Yeah, it definitely sounds like it and I know a ton of people in the space are waiting for that kind of killer social media backend application and I feel like lens definitely has the first mover advantage on that. So excited to keep following it, but I did want to steer the correction a little bit towards Ave as we only have like about ten minutes left. Can't forget about the OG baby of your Estani. So I'm curious how go is coming along. We just saw curve USD launch, obviously die and fracs have been around for a while. So I guess what's the differentiator for go? What's the timeline and how are you feeling about the implementation?
01:15:07.802 - 01:16:15.250, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm actually quite happy that the decentralized stablecoin, especially on the overcollateral side, is getting more traction. In our case with the go, there's quite a lot of things that has been already done on our side that really gets us into very near moment of progressing more. The code has been public for quite a while to the infrastructure itself is ready. The governance process has been progressing. There's been a couple of votes regarding the interest rates that the governance wants to set and accepting a second facilitator. So facilitator is essentially a bucket and a mandate to mint go, which is also quite an interesting concept. So the first facilitator allows to mint go against your collateralization at Aave protocol.
01:16:15.250 - 01:17:36.010, Speaker C: And the second one is just a flash minter facilitator. So there's a certain bucket size of flash minting go and doing all this possibility stuff in Defi. So basically the whole process is quite far. And I think down the line, what's important for us is kind of like the idea of go is obviously it brings diversity into the stablecoins ecosystem, especially on the overcollada stablecoin part. But the more kind of like a bigger vision is that we really want to push stablecoins in DFI as a more of a financial layer for the Internet, meaning that with the layer twos, we might actually have a better chance of seeing more payment applications being built. And it's quite ironic because bitcoin in the first place was there to solve payments between people. And with Defi we built a quite robust financial ecosystem with swapping, lending and borrowing and stablecoins.
01:17:36.010 - 01:18:38.590, Speaker C: But no one in crypto actually uses stablecoins to settle their payments every day. So there are some, of course, but the scale is so small at this point, and it could bring a lot of transparency and accountability to Internet payment transactions. So that's kind of our vision, is that we're super excited that it goes live quite soon. But then what's more exciting is that how it could actually create impact and benefit people across globally, build their financial ecosystem, which is more transparent, more resilient, and has guaranteed execution with the smart contract. So that's something we're super excited about and also excited about that there's other folks in the market that are also working hard towards the same goal, so we're all in the same boat.
01:18:38.670 - 01:18:46.286, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that. There's also seemingly an increased overlap between Makerdao and Ave in some degree.
01:18:46.318 - 01:18:46.466, Speaker C: Right.
01:18:46.488 - 01:19:10.522, Speaker A: The Makerdao team of course, forked the Ave v three front end in contracts to build spark, and of course is paying a fee back to Ave for doing so. And they are able to use the Dai savings rate to kind of create this new lending market for dai using Spark. And so I'm curious, how do you think that will influence the Ave's market for dai lending?
01:19:10.586 - 01:20:39.126, Speaker C: No, I'm glad they formed the Ave retreat because I personally believe what we build with our team and the support with the community quite, I think like a state of the art protocol that is very flexible. So you can create markets where collaterals might not be borrowable and you can borrow against them, but the collateral itself is not lended and create similar markets that already exist in the ob ecosystem. I personally think they lowballed the profit sharing, but that's up to the governance and it's something I'm not really involved. I, I think probably down the line we will see more this kind of focus synergies as well. And now having go that also helps to kind of like having some sort of like a cross liquidity between all of these markets. So I'm happy that they went to this path as well, because it was also a missing component for their ecosystem. I think down the line, what we're following more is kind of like a bigger vision of how we get these stable coins, or how we get Defi more into wider adoption and keep experimenting.
01:20:39.126 - 01:21:57.298, Speaker C: And a lot of the exciting things that has happened in the auba ecosystem and things that we build comes from some degree of experimentations as well. And I do think I've participated in the at least one hackathon and we're talking to hackers there about Defi. And I think we're in a kind of like a state of defi where we can't really anymore look into finance and what exists there and fill gaps in Defi. We have to really think about what kind of things we need to really build that could be better, create more impact, help the users and help adoption. So they appreciate a lot d five builders that have existed and have builded and contributed for the past years. But I'm somewhat even more excited about the Defi builders that are here to build the future and kind of like tackling a bit more those challenging parts of how we get more kind of like a scale and adoption. So it's definitely going to be interesting next few years on the defi side.
01:21:57.464 - 01:21:58.434, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
01:21:58.552 - 01:22:18.802, Speaker B: Actually, I meant to ask this question when we're talking about lens, but since you've said we're hoping go can actually be used in the real world in some capacity sometime in the future, are you guys looking at any way to build out kind of like a mobile strategy? Like I know Uniswap with their mobile wallet. I'm just curious if lens or Aave teams are thinking in the same vein.
01:22:18.866 - 01:23:33.170, Speaker C: Yeah, it's quite interesting. I really appreciate what Uniswap team did, and I like that they have know it's a wallet only to swap on Uniswap and kind of like having that mobile experience in their ecosystem. The way I think about web three and building is that I want to build a very core infrastructure that really gives a lot of design space and experimentation space for a lot of the builders in the space and leaves ability for them to build those applications that might bring them into mainstream. We do kind of understand that what kind of things could be built and guide to the right direction. But that's the beauty of a decentralized ecosystem, is that you really don't need to build everything. You can just focus on making and bringing one thing and ensuring it works well, and then all the things actually will build around. And good example for that is that we launched lens a year ago.
01:23:33.170 - 01:24:26.546, Speaker C: By the way, it's one year anniversary for lens on the main net. So there's actually a mainnet post on Lenster, on lens protocol that you can collect for one matic that is kind of like an anniversary post. But anyway, so we launched the protocol without any front ends, and someone built a front end in a hackathon that is open source, anyone can fork it. And suddenly in two months of our range, we saw first front ends being clients, being built on blends. And actually they're very good now. They have very good music experience, video experience, and it just gets better down the line. So if there's really good margin and space left for builders, they usually come and build as well.
01:24:26.546 - 01:24:42.770, Speaker C: And I'm kind of expecting the same for the abbot ecosystem. One thing they need is basically a vision and a path and some also ideas. And usually that's how we see a lot of innovation.
01:24:42.930 - 01:24:43.574, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
01:24:43.612 - 01:25:23.730, Speaker A: Go check out that NFT here. Thanks for calling that one out there, Stani. And I want to ask one more closing question. Just because the lines between AaVE and lens are, I can see a world where they overlap in that if lens can at some point be used as some sort of decentralized identity solution, and then theoretically you could have a go facilitator that was authorized to mint a certain amount of go in some sort of under collateralized loan fashion. I mean, I think this is pretty far out on the timeline, if ever possible. But I'm curious really quickly, if you could just provide your insights around like, do you think lens could ever be some sort of decentralized identity protocol?
01:25:26.070 - 01:26:39.274, Speaker C: I definitely see them working in kind of like a separate ecosystem and ecosystem involved, but I do see down the line value in actually, let's say that you're using lens protocol and you have an audience and you're earning some sort of income and your income could be predicted out of it. So it's kind of interesting because we really don't earn anything on social, in most cases online. The way Internet is built anyways, today is that it's the companies that are making all the money and the users are just like consuming, contributing. We kind of are trying to make the Internet more people powered. Right. If in the future you have creators or users that are earning income and you can predict that income, I could see that could be like one step of some sort of trust network for providing liquidity and capital down the line. But I think we're still far away from that.
01:26:39.274 - 01:27:29.114, Speaker C: I do think that the current credit markets aren't really fair, especially if you are moving from one country to another. It's very hard to passport your credit ratings. You might start from pretty much zero. So there's advantages of blockchain based data and utilizing that, and if you have audience and revenue, that could be a first step. But we've really built lens from the perspective of how to make Internet more people powered. Taking away from businesses and giving to people can be the description there, but it's an interesting idea down the line for awesome, awesome.
01:27:29.152 - 01:27:46.562, Speaker A: Well, Stannie, this has been a fantastic conversation. I really appreciate you taking the time to come out and speak with us. Thanks again for coming on. And if you want to leave the audience with somewhere to find you, learn more about what you're building and what your current thoughts are. Maybe even show your lens handle. I saw you're closing in on the we'd love to help you get there.
01:27:46.616 - 01:28:14.230, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm stunned of lens and you can follow me across all the lens applications if you don't have a lens profile yet. So lens protocol is still in beta, so we can give a profile if you're building something on lens or you're curious about Webtree social. Excited what we are building, just send me a DM on Twitter and I can help you go from there.
01:28:14.300 - 01:28:15.220, Speaker A: Great, thanks a lot. Study.
