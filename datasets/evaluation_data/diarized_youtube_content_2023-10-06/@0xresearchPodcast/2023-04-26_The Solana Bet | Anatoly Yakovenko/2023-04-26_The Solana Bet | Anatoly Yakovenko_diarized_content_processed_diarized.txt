00:00:00.250 - 00:00:28.200, Speaker A: Like the gas wars that occur on Ethereum are extracting value from the use cases that are running on it, from the users, from the liquidators, from the actual Mav bots. If you think Mav is a net positive, the gas is actually taking away from it and it is giving it back to the Ethereum holders. But I think over the long term, there's no way that level of extraction survive mass adoption. It's just not how technology works.
00:00:31.290 - 00:01:21.102, Speaker B: All righty everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Today we are recording on April 24 and we have a great interview for you, this time with Anatoly, the co founder of Salana. We've been on a huge modular thesis binge in the past couple of episodes, and we really wanted someone to come on and give us the counterargument. Why is all of this wrong? What is the other solution? And why is that one right? And no one else better to do this than Anatole, the founder of a monolithic blockchain that is really based around high performance, high throughput, low fees. Just a totally different approach than really the modular thesis of specializing each blockchain for one individual component. But as always, we are joined by two of the blockworks research analysts to kind of give us a market recap of everything we've had going on since the last episode was released. This time it's Ren in zero X pibbles.
00:01:21.102 - 00:01:24.726, Speaker B: Ren, I'll throw it to you first. Man, who do you got in the hot seat or cool throne this week?
00:01:24.828 - 00:02:11.218, Speaker C: Yeah, sure, I have a hot seat this week. This week my hot seat is MeV blocker. So if you're paying attention, probably around two weeks ago, CowSop and a few other DeFi protocols and a few other MEV infrastructure protocols worked together to release MeV blocker. For those that who don't know, MeV Blocker is an RPC that basically prevents your trades on a decks, more often than not from getting front run or sandwich. And I think this week a few people have learned how the RPC works in itself and how it prevents the front running. And there's been several points of contention within the MEV community. So specifically with Mev Blocker, a searcher can see the content of a transaction without the signature.
00:02:11.218 - 00:03:03.894, Speaker C: So that does mean that if you are a searcher and if a user is going to buy a token, they could still try to fund run you just perhaps non atomically in a separate bundle. Right? So in order to combat this, what MeV blocker does is that it sends a number of fake transactions to searchers within the public. Mempooth. So if you're a user wanting to buy token X, Mev blocker basically can generate two more transactions that basically say that you are going to buy token Y and you're going to buy token Z instead. So now basically, if you're a searcher and if you want to buy token Y, which the user is not actually buying, you're going to lose money there because there's no one to sort of close your trade out. You're just going to buy the token and you're going to sell to yourself and you lose money on fees, or for example like the Dex fees. And so because of that, the searcher doesn't know whether x, y or z is real.
00:03:03.894 - 00:03:34.970, Speaker C: And that's essentially the mechanism in which Mev blocker, quote unquote, guarantees that your transaction won't be front run or sandwich. And as far as for me, that just feels like a weird mechanism to you in terms of sure you want to share information about your transaction, but you don't want to share too much to the point where a searcher can front run you and then your solution becomes spamming the mempu with random fake transactions. And it just seems inefficient, for lack of a better term.
00:03:35.050 - 00:03:55.766, Speaker B: Yeah, it does seem like an interesting way to kind of go about this problem. But what's interesting is, I agree with you, it feels like rudimentary in a way, but if it works, and that's our best current solution, then does it matter that it feels like overly simplistic? I don't know. In crypto we always bring up like razors and whatnot. So like Occam's razor, maybe the simplest way is the best way. Yeah.
00:03:55.788 - 00:04:12.554, Speaker D: And also I've been using MeV blocker and it's really fast. I remember when flashbots dropped their mev mitigation RPC. I feel like the transactions were a little slower, but Mev blocker is really fast. I like it.
00:04:12.672 - 00:04:43.378, Speaker E: That actually feeds pretty well into my hot seat for the week, which is just the general market. We saw a ton of meme coins get launched. Everyone was trading Pepe, LSD, doge wojak, neon or whatever it was called. It just got a little bit wild. I think we all should have known it was a little toppy in the market. But yeah, MeV extractors had an absolute field day with all the meme coin action going on. And it was kind of interesting to me because I noticed that the l two Dex volume is kind of on a rise or on the rise.
00:04:43.378 - 00:05:23.250, Speaker E: But then I looked at uni v three on arbitrum, and there's really not that much volume on meme coins. But then you go to univ two on Ethereum, and the top ten pairs are pretty much all meme coins, Pepe being number one with like $400 million of seven day volume. So I'm not really sure what the reasoning is. Maybe it's because univ two isn't really on many l two s, but those l two s aren't extracting mev, and then they have lower transaction fees. So I don't understand why meme season wouldn't take place on an l two. Maybe it's just better marketing, more people paying attention to the hot contracts on Ethereum main net. Not really sure, but yeah, nonetheless, I've got the market in general on the hot seat.
00:05:23.250 - 00:05:25.746, Speaker E: Definitely got a little complacent over the.
00:05:25.768 - 00:05:26.980, Speaker A: Past couple of weeks.
00:05:27.430 - 00:06:14.910, Speaker B: I agree with you. It really feels like we should have seen this one coming when last week all the slack channel was popping off with these different meme coins. But yeah, nonetheless, it did get frothy. I think we actually put arb sellers in the hot seat last week, which maybe we need to be in the hot seat for throwing that one there, because Arb has been one of the biggest losers. Just being a higher beta coin over the last couple of weeks, those tend to indeed be the biggest losers. But, yeah, I think the point about meme coins is interesting, right? And I don't know, it brings up my inner conspiracy theorist. Is there a cabal that's launching these meme tokens that actually see traction and tend to have similar wallet histories linking a couple of them together? And then you start to think, all right, well, this is all happening on ETH.
00:06:14.910 - 00:06:40.234, Speaker B: It's a great way to say there's still eth burn. It's still proving things to be proving economic activity, because on the surface, you just see, Dex, volumes are high, and it does look like that. But I don't know. I haven't dug into that theory at all. So it's really just a baseless claim. But I don't know. There's also the idea, I guess, that if you're going to launch a meme token, you want to kind of go to where the wealth is rather than trying to pull the wealth somewhere else.
00:06:40.234 - 00:06:48.400, Speaker B: And by far the most wealth is on Ethereum. So it's like, make it easy for people to buy, don't maybe bridge anywhere else. Just throw the meme token here.
00:06:49.890 - 00:07:08.790, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. And a fun fact for all the listeners is that half of our team got rugged on neon coin last week. So if the dev is listening to this, I wish you a very bad day. But we started off strong in Wojak early in the quarter.
00:07:09.290 - 00:07:22.570, Speaker E: Ren, you had a cool theory too, around kind of like mev bots, purposefully, I guess, putting these meme coins out there to try and get attention and extract mev. Do you think there's much legitimacy to that theory?
00:07:23.390 - 00:08:10.070, Speaker C: I think that partially, or at least that's a conspiracy theory I believe in. Because on one hand, most of the aum within crypto still lies on Ethereum, right? Rather than arbitrary and optimism. But perhaps you could also argue that if it did launch on arbitrary optimism, it would have just seen a lot more volume just because transaction fees are lower. But also, there's no mev for you to extract on arbitrary optimism today, given those centralized sequences. So I don't know, I like to believe it, but also just some interesting stats. Like Jared from Subway, the famous MeV bot last week made around $2 million in profits, which is a crazy amount. He was basically all of the trade volume within the pepe the war Jack autumn meme coin pooze.
00:08:10.070 - 00:09:19.850, Speaker C: The guy processed, I think 750,000,000 in volume between ETH and all the meme coins, which is pretty ridiculous for an MEV searcher. And I think a few other notable people within the MEV community have also pointed out that there was a combination of factors that made it so lucrative for MEV participants last week, right? One was that apparently there were bots that were designed to make any user sell transaction fail, right? So they will basically just mess with all the transactions front, run it, and basically make the slippage within the pool higher than your slippage tolerance. And to basically give the impression to users that your transaction is going to fail unless you set a really high slippage tolerance. And I can't confirm it, I haven't looked at the data, but that's apparently what's happened. There were bots in those liquidity pools intentionally, like messing up prices and making everyone's trades fail. And so everyone ended up putting really ridiculous slippages. And if you went to look at, for example, Eigenfi, the Wojack, the PP, and if you looked at sort of the top profiting MEV transactions, some of them were really ridiculous.
00:09:19.850 - 00:09:32.258, Speaker C: The MEV bot profited like, user got like $500 back from his transactions, which implies a stiffish tolerance of like 99%, which I'm not sure why would you ever do.
00:09:32.424 - 00:09:43.814, Speaker B: That's, I guess, a summary of our state of the market. Right. The market moves against us, and we simply bring out the conspiracy theories, pibbles. Who you got on the cool throne this week? Yeah.
00:09:43.852 - 00:10:18.366, Speaker D: So I have the XNFt backpack team. It was a super fun mint. That was my first mint on Solana in quite a while. And it was super cool. Like, Thursday night when they were supposed to mint, it got pushed back an hour, then another hour, then a whole day, because they were getting ddos. I think they had upwards of, like 2 billion requests at one point, but they had a successful mint on Friday night. And it's really neat because it's like the first public Xnft mint.
00:10:18.366 - 00:10:35.138, Speaker D: And that's like an executable NFT. So you can have xnfts that are dapps, that are live in your own wallet. So this was the first mint that was live in the backpack wallet. It was a super cool experience, and overall, I just really like the backpack wallet.
00:10:35.234 - 00:11:01.946, Speaker E: Yeah, we've been harping on these for the last week and a half, two weeks, and it was fun to actually experience the mint firsthand. I was actually going to be really pissed because it was supposed to be at 07:00 on Friday after they delayed it today, and then they did ten minutes and then ten more minutes, and I was like, oh, my God, this is about to be a repeat of last night. And it's like a Friday night at 720. I'm like, this is the last thing I feel like doing. But yeah, super excited about these things. I scooped one as well. I know the floor has been kind of a rocket ship.
00:11:01.946 - 00:11:35.562, Speaker E: It's Monday, April 24, but the floor is sitting mid high 70s, so I'll be curious to see if the price action actually sustains. I saw some people on Twitter talking about how Haiti swap, which is like a pseudoswap rip off on Salana, acquired like, 225 mad lads in order to kind of have some protocol and liquidity and drive some volume over there. So apparently that's a bad thing for the longevity of the floor price. But I don't really know. I don't stick around Salana too much during my personal usage on chain, so not super sure.
00:11:35.696 - 00:11:36.138, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:36.224 - 00:12:01.700, Speaker D: Some cooler things to point out about the mad lads mint is one. The Solana network didn't go down, so it's really cool. I mean, they get tons of flak for that. It's happened a few times, but there's quite a bit of demand and things worked out fine. Another thing to flag is that there's going to be some sort of snapshot on April 29, I think, and we have no idea what that's for.
00:12:02.390 - 00:12:46.110, Speaker B: On your first point there, we kind of get into this with the talk with anatoly, but briefly, the isolated fee markets and some of the other technological improvements that Salana has been working on over the last six to twelve months have really come to fruition in this moment. Right. Massive demand. It actually crashed the backpack app itself, but yet the activity on chain, you wouldn't even be able to tell. Right. So we'll get into the interview of what the isolated fee markets do, but basically with a global fee market, if one piece of the ecosystem is getting really expensive to use, a lot of demand for it, then everybody pays more fees. We see that on Ethereum, right? If there's an NFT mint, then all of a sudden selling it, making uniswap transaction becomes five x more expensive.
00:12:46.110 - 00:13:03.154, Speaker B: But in the case of Salana and their isolated fee markets, just because there's one active mint, not other users, don't have to pay more. And that's something that I wouldn't be surprised to see become more of like a crypto standard. If we fast forward a couple of years from now, that just seems like a better way to build a blockchain.
00:13:03.282 - 00:13:36.066, Speaker C: Yeah. Going back to XNFts, I think it introduces some sort of unique mental models for people to think about. Right. For example, in the past, if you wanted to gate access to a protocol or quote unquote an app, a very common method was to issue a limited edition NFT. Then you would have to hold that NFT in your wallet. Then you could access the protocol. Right? But now with X NFTs, rather than issuing limited edition nfts to access the protocol, you could issue limited edition apps or the X NFTs themselves.
00:13:36.066 - 00:14:37.950, Speaker C: And I think it's just a very interesting way of thinking about the possibilities with executable code within an NFT. And I also asked some guy at Solana, I think, some person on the developer relationships team, in terms of what's possible, right? For example, if I have to update the XNFT, do I have to reissue a new XNFT? And the answer is, know. I thought it was yes, but apparently all you need to do is provide an updated bundle and re upload it. Then the X NFT will update its metadata. And for example, you're also able to have multiplayer games work on X NFTs, which is also. I didn't think that was the case because all of the games within the backpack app were single player, like 2048, Flappy bird, all of those really old school fun to play games. But apparently there's a way to sort of make an onchain game which validates a state and basically stores a state hash and so you can validate the state of the game and multiple people can play within the same Xnft.
00:14:37.950 - 00:14:40.646, Speaker C: So I just thought those are very interesting to think about.
00:14:40.748 - 00:15:08.814, Speaker E: Yeah, that is super cool, Ren. Plus, just think about the security upgrade for users. If it's in the App Store and it's trending, it's probably pretty safe. Versus I still triple check addresses when I type them in manually. If I don't have them bookmarked, like I'll go to the docs and then I'll go to their twitter and make sure that I have the right URL before I connect. So it'd be really nice to just have that all in one spot within your own wallet. But Dan, I know you got a cool throne this week.
00:15:08.814 - 00:15:09.518, Speaker E: What you got?
00:15:09.604 - 00:15:51.930, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. I'll take us back to Ethereum land and I'm actually putting one of the OG defi apps on the coolthrone curve finance. So I feel like we've been harping on their stablecoin. That's been like such a long time coming. But over the weekend we saw some interesting activity around zero x babe, one of the curve deployer addresses. Maybe we can link that address in the show notes, just if anybody wants a free little alpha to follow, that's a great address to throw on the etherscan watch list. But nonetheless, this address had some interesting activity around launching and testing new contracts, and some of these were appeared to be stable swap pools with ETH native as the pairing.
00:15:51.930 - 00:16:37.414, Speaker B: And if we check the GitHub, there was a couple updates around test deployment of a dummy contract and things like test new price Oracle. And one of the things that they've been working on is creating a price oracle that is an alternative to use to Chainlink. And so this kind of starts to feel like it's the last piece before we see curve USD. The stablecoin and lending protocol go live. Because obviously with a lending protocol you have collateral and you need to know the price of that collateral to make these pendulum type liquidations. And this is going to be a huge unlock for a lot of different reasons, aside from the obvious ones like vertical integration for the protocol. Right? So also adding a stable coin and a lending protocol on top of the decentralized exchange.
00:16:37.414 - 00:17:12.790, Speaker B: It also gets the protocol revenue diversification benefit of that as well. But to me, there's a more exciting unlock here, and that's really like creating this Felix transfer market between different types of listed collaterals. And so what I mean by that, this is actually first flagged to me by Curvecap. He's got a great substack, you should definitely check that out. But he kind of brought this idea to me where if you have. So assume there's two collateral types, wrap, bitcoin and eth, for example. Each of those would have its own amm, so its own pool, and they'd have liquidity within this pool.
00:17:12.790 - 00:18:08.614, Speaker B: Well, if you assume that this is the case, then these pools are natively generating fee revenue from interest freeze, which means that the protocol can set the trading freeze of these two pools to near zero. Or let's just assume zero, and it would still be generating revenue even if swaps are running through this pool at a 0% trading fee. So basically, curve USD can come like this fearless link between different types of collateral, right, because that's in the world where we only have two collaterals, but let's assume there's now ten or 1000 collaterals. Well, this stablecoin then becomes like this fearless transfer mechanism. And the more depth, the larger trades you can push through these pools. And it kind of just makes an interesting scenario where curve is a little bit more prepared for this race to the bottom in fees that we kind of expect to see in the decentralized exchange market. So it's just kind of like another interesting element for how this stablecoin and lending protocol gets a little more interesting than just the.
00:18:08.614 - 00:18:43.534, Speaker B: On the surface. Like, oh, we're expanding what the protocol does, but this also comes at a time when we see more developments being pushed out by the curve team. Right? So the first leg of the tricrypto upgraded contracts was just rolled out as well, earlier today on the 24th. And so the tricrypto upgraded contracts are a huge unlock. And honestly, to me, this is even more exciting than the stablecoin, for a very simple reason. So, the tricrypto pool is one of the largest pools on curve. This pool holds ethereum, wrap, bitcoin, and USDT tether.
00:18:43.534 - 00:20:01.334, Speaker B: And it's like using the curve v two amm, which is a concentrated liquidity amm that automatically adjusts pool's liquidity around a central point. So it's kind of like in contrast to uniswap v three, which allows lps to move their liquidity across different ranges selected individually by each LP in a curve v two pool, the point of concentration is automatically updated based on like an exponential moving average of the swaps that are being run through the pool. So when the exponential moving average moves too far away from the current market price, that is when the next trader will be tasked with running a computation that rebalances the pool's liquidity. Now, the issue is that that computation is pretty expensive, and you're putting it on the burden, like the burden falls on the trader, which traders are the ones generating your fees. So it's not that great that you're kind of putting this burden on them, because ultimately the gas cost to execute swaps in that pool will increase. Well, the upgraded version of the tricrypto contracts dramatically reduces this cost. The early tests were around the forex improvement, and if that's the case, then when it gets pushed out to mainnet, which it feels like it's hours, or if not, at most days, at this point, we'll really see if that four x improvement was realized.
00:20:01.334 - 00:20:57.498, Speaker B: But what this will do, if that four x improvement is true, then we will have the an average swap will be cheaper on curve than it is on uniswap. And a lot of the time, it looks like the curve V two model can throw you a better price than uniswap V three could. The issue was we really missed out on the gas fee difference, right? So it was more expensive to run this trade, then the savings you'd get on a better price was removed by the extra gas cost that you'd have to pay to execute. And lastly, one of the biggest issues that curve is facing right now in terms of achieving the most Dex volume possible is the absence of an ETH and USDC pairing. Right now, that pair accounts for about 42 43% of Uniswap's volume on ETH mainnet, and curve just has no exposure to that. To run an ETH to USD swap using only curve, you'd have to be routed through two different pools. And again, it comes down to gas costs.
00:20:57.498 - 00:21:31.020, Speaker B: That's just an expensive trade. So Uniswap is just absolutely eating all that volume. And it'll be very interesting when you see new pools launched that kind of can service this new market. That, again, is a massive portion of Uniswap's revenue. So I kind of personally expect to see curve eat into a massive portion of that volume. Again, this is kind of on the back of the assumption that the upgrade successfully reduces the gas costs used to run these trades, but the curve devs are pretty fucking based, so I really wouldn't be expected to see anything else.
00:21:32.830 - 00:22:10.566, Speaker E: Yeah, and if anyone else's eyes or ears kind of glossed over during all that stuff, but it sounded really bullish, just go follow when llama on Twitter and it's kind of like a high beta curve play. I don't really know what the deal with them is, to be completely honest, but I really like llamas and they're minting every hour and a half, I believe, until Sunday of next week. So you got to get kind of lucky. I think it's an auction style mechanism, so you just got to check back every hour and a half and maybe get a cheap llama. But it's directly related to the curve dow. Dan, you probably know more than I do, but the floor is around three e right now, so if you can snipe a cheap one, it's pretty good.
00:22:10.588 - 00:22:56.726, Speaker C: R if none of that makes sense too, you could also subscribe to blockworks research, and we have a great report written by Dan about all of those fancy mechanisms that he just described, and he really writes it down super well, and even I could understand it, which means you should probably subscribe. But either way, for Dexes, I think it makes sense, right? I think everyone knows that Dex fees are based at the bottom, right? It happened in tradfi with stock brokerages. It'll probably happen in crypto too. Just no one really wants to pay 30 bips, even on the long tail asset. And so the fact that curves is interesting mechanism to compensate lps even without the presence of trading fees, just seems really interesting compared to all of the other Dex sort of designs out there.
00:22:56.828 - 00:23:27.546, Speaker B: Well, you guys are really making me feel like I need to TLDR that. So quick recap. Stablecoin and lending protocol gets you vertical integration and revenue diversification, also with the ability to kind of compete in that Felix race to the bottom that Ren was just talking about. And the upgraded tri crypto contracts allow you to permissionlessly pool any three assets of which ETH USDC will likely be common pairings. And that will help curve compete greatly with uniswap in terms of volume dominance.
00:23:27.658 - 00:23:27.934, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:23:27.972 - 00:23:31.866, Speaker E: Well, I think that's a good spot to call it over to our interview with Anatoly.
00:23:31.978 - 00:24:15.280, Speaker B: Awesome, everyone. Well, we are joined by Anatole, the co founder of Solana. Truly a man that needs no introduction, but thanks a lot for joining us today, Anatoly. We're excited to kind of dive into a lot of the recent developments of what's been going on with Solana as a whole, but also some of the more technical stuff as well as that's kind of the sector that we'd like to dive into the most on this podcast. But again, there's been a lot of exciting news over the past couple days and even weeks, so love to dive in there first. And we've really seen this shift to a mobile first perspective in crypto, and you guys are really making an effort to capture on that with the release of the saga, the new phone powered by Solana. And so I'd love to get your take on kind of the core strategy behind launching that phone.
00:24:15.280 - 00:24:25.986, Speaker B: And this comes on the back of news of like, Uniswap releasing a mobile first app as well. So we're really seeing that shift. And, yeah, again, just want to get your take on, really the core strategy behind Salana launching this phone.
00:24:26.088 - 00:25:18.206, Speaker A: As you guys know, it's really hard for web three apps to actually get approved in the iOS and Google Play stores. And oftentimes they have to cut features and kind of hide what they're doing. And the experience on mobile has been pretty bad, I would say the transitions are kind of weird. Every application you connect to, there's like 50 wallets to choose from to connect to. And then you're kind of dealing with this weird context switching or having to copy a link to the thing that you want to do inside the embedded browser in these wallets. So it doesn't feel like the future of finance at all. I think that kind of was one of the main reasons, but one of the other ones was that simply, I worked at Qualcomm for over a decade.
00:25:18.206 - 00:26:19.042, Speaker A: The stuff that we worked on there, even when I was there, we were already building trusted display and trusted touch, like secure display and secure touch, and the trust zone that connects all three of those pieces, to make sure that when you have to build applications that have that super high security requirements, that Android can't even look at the display or take a screenshot of it, like all of these things, that technology was already there. That was like, I think, close to a decade ago. So I felt that it's just really a shame that it's not by default in every phone, that every device right now isn't like that perfect hardware wallet that you want, that's programmable with a rich set of applications that can interact with it and stuff like that. So that was the other reason I really wanted to see if we can kind of set an example and move the industry forward a bit. But the main one is that devs really need, like, I think a third party store that's crypto friendly.
00:26:19.106 - 00:26:39.014, Speaker E: Now, something I'm really excited about is backpack and x nfts. With mad lads minting tonight. We're actually recording on Thursday, April 20, for those listening on Wednesday, six days later. But is that going to be integrated directly in saga? And are you pretty excited about, like, can you kind of explain what xnfts are and why they're unique?
00:26:39.062 - 00:27:26.182, Speaker A: Yeah. Xnfts are a way to deploy applications. It's kind of very similar to what an App Store does. What's really cool about it is that this is something that a standard that Armani build, who's the founder of Backpack for devs, to build applications that get embedded inside the wallet. And you kind of need that because the wallet is a very kind of visceral experience of ownership and crypto. What makes an NFT is the fact that Phantom and Soulflare all display the same image for the same address and the NFT, that's really what makes it. If there's like another data structure that has the same kind of mathematical representation in the data, there's like public key, and it points to that image.
00:27:26.182 - 00:27:56.130, Speaker A: It's not an NFT because I don't see it in my wallet. This is like a very important concept, I think, for adoption of digital assets. And the fact that you can build a protocol with your own implementation of how to display and interact with that digital asset and then propagate it now to all the users of backpack, I think is really cool. It's really going to, I think, accelerate the development of how users interact with web three with new digital assets and stuff like that.
00:27:56.280 - 00:28:21.790, Speaker E: Interesting. And we've kind of been on a modular tear on this podcast, like, the last three or four. You know, in that conversation, you often hear light clients, and I think it was Nick White from Celestia was. Yeah, like, I'm super excited to see how saga goes. It'd be awesome. Know, we could get kind of like a light client App Store type deal on the saga phone. Is the phone going to be very solana focused? In particular, are you open to a lot of different other.
00:28:21.860 - 00:28:52.118, Speaker A: I'm an open source maxi. So we just had to ship, so we cut down all features that were necessary. And now that we have some breathing room, folks are adding support for other curves. So I think, honestly, anyone that's using that to 519 curve should be able to use add a wallet to it, which I think a bunch of blockchains are anyways. Already. So I think we want to add support for basically whatever is missing. We'll add support for it.
00:28:52.118 - 00:29:23.310, Speaker A: I think it'd be really cool to see the entire industry start kind of like collaborating on what these data structures look like for sharing applications on chain, but also moderation and all these other things, because those are very much part of the mobile experience. We really don't want to be in control of any of it. I kind of feel like users should be able to pick whatever application top ten list they want, right, which is like where the moderation comes in and stuff like that.
00:29:23.380 - 00:30:00.934, Speaker B: Hey everyone, big announcement from the Blockworks podcast network. We're launching a new show called Lightspeed and hiring two hosts to come build it with us. Lightspeed is a show for builders focused on the use cases that will onboard the next generation of crypto users by taking learnings and inspiration from the garage days of Silicon Valley, we really want to capture the perspective from builders because that's what the ethos of crypto is, content experimentation and relentless innovation to build products that users can't resist. If hosting a show like this sounds exciting to you, then head over to the careers page on Blockworks Co. Which we have linked in the show notes. You can also reach out to me or Sam on Twitter to talk more about the opportunity. But overall, we're stoked about Lightspeed.
00:30:00.934 - 00:30:04.086, Speaker B: So if you think you'd be a great host, please do not hesitate to reach out.
00:30:04.128 - 00:30:14.190, Speaker E: One other exciting development over the last week, I think it was just yesterday actually, helium making the official migration over to Salana. Can you kind of speak to that and where you're excited?
00:30:14.270 - 00:31:22.758, Speaker A: It is so cool. I don't understand why it's not like the biggest thing in tech, because 5G is a really cool technology, but it's very expensive to deploy. So what most people don't realize is that 4g cellular networks, those towers have like a range of 30 to 40 km, but five G, the ultra wideband cells only have a range of about 400 meters, so it's very short and they can't go through walls, they can't go through trees. So if you were to just blanket United States coast to coast with 5g ultra wide band cellular hotspots, it would take like, I think some people estimated like 10 million. You probably don't need that many to cover all the users because most users are concentrated and there's wifi in a lot of places, but it's still going to take a lot of work to get you that I'm driving down the highway at 50 miles an hour, like 60 miles an hour. And I'm watching a movie and my friends are all facetiming, right, with somebody on the other side of the world also driving like 60 miles an hour. Right.
00:31:22.758 - 00:32:09.122, Speaker A: It's just going to take a lot of hardware to do that. And what's really cool about helium is that they've proven out that users can deploy a lot of hardware like all over the world and do all that coordinating using cryptography and a blockchain. So they did that with their low end network, which is built for IoT. So you can build IoT devices that have insane battery life. But now they're trying to do this for five G and they're competing with the biggest corporations in the world with at and T and Verizon and stuff like that. And I think they have a shot of actually doing it faster than them. And if that happens, I think that's like real proof that decentralization is like a net good for the economy.
00:32:09.122 - 00:32:44.622, Speaker A: It touches the very fundamental thing that we very fundamental piece of the US economy could be built by decentralized networks that could be like, I think, groundbreaking for the entire industry. So I'm really excited for them. Just to give you a sense of where things are at. I think at and T and Verizon have about 50,000 cell towers for five G. I think helium is at about 8000. So it's not like they're a million to like 1000. It's like actually they have a reasonable shop.
00:32:44.622 - 00:32:50.242, Speaker A: It just started actually passing them. And that I think, in itself would be, I think, massive news.
00:32:50.376 - 00:33:13.850, Speaker B: Yeah, that would be a big win for, honestly, the industry as a whole. But I'm curious. So one of Solana's original messages was really about trying to bring be the Nasdaq on the blockchain. But given this more, it feels like there's been some sort of a shift right away from that order book style idea into this more mobile first idea. So I'm just curious, how do you view the vision of Solana today?
00:33:13.920 - 00:34:06.070, Speaker A: Well, the focus on speed and performance, that is not actually going away. We've tripled down on the investment there with fire Dancer. It's just when you improve cost and performance and fidelity and all these things that you need for Nasdaq level finance, it makes everything else just great. It makes it easy. The user experiences are fantastic and you have low fees and fast finality. That's what users want. And those additional use cases don't even come close to the amount of traffic that's generated by oracles and order books like Pith and Openbook, and all these hero now and ellipsis, all of these order book style dexes generate massive, massive more number of transactions than the users.
00:34:06.070 - 00:34:19.486, Speaker A: So my feeling was always like, if we can get it to work in that Nasdaq level, it works for Nasdaq, and it's a decentralized, global, permissionless network, then all the web three stuff is just going to come for free.
00:34:19.588 - 00:34:41.618, Speaker B: I love that framework and thought process. And one of the things you mentioned was firedancer. So having that unlock of diversifying the network clients with fire dancer is a huge unlock. And I believe that makes Solana the only other network with a second client other than Ethereum. So I'd love for you to dive in on really what fire dancer is and how it improves performance.
00:34:41.714 - 00:35:12.382, Speaker A: So this is a team out of jump trading. This is actually, their chief scientist is now leading this effort. It's a second implementation of the Solana client, written entirely in C hyper optimized. It's built on a technology platform that jump uses internally for data processing. So they handle 400 gigabits worth of throughput on this software platform. It's really cool. This is like what I dreamed of.
00:35:12.382 - 00:35:58.670, Speaker A: Salana should be designed like when I started, but we just didn't have the resources to kind of build it from scratch that way. But because they now see the end state, they know exactly what we built and what the design is. They can actually then do all of these hyper optimizations. And the kind of results they're demonstrating are ridiculous. So during breakpoint, they showed they can do this is like commodity hardware. Off the shelf intel boxes was handling 600,000 transactions per second throughput through the transaction scheduling stage, which is really cool. Richard recently tweeted their demos of quick, which is like the Internet protocol that we're using for coordination.
00:35:58.670 - 00:36:28.438, Speaker A: They're showing, like, on four cores, it's doing over 22 gigabits worth of throughput. People that are super into low level networking understand what XDP is and how to actually take advantage of all of this low level network hardware should go look at the repo for find answer. It's awesome.
00:36:28.604 - 00:36:47.806, Speaker B: Yeah, that thing just sounds like it's absolutely screaming. And so I guess that begs the question, though, if fired answer is so much more performant than the current Solana client, you'd imagine every validator is going to kind of switch over to running fire dancers. Does that kind of like, remove the benefits of the diversification in this case?
00:36:47.908 - 00:37:40.874, Speaker A: So the key part for safety is that the runtime logic, like the thing that actually plays the transactions forward and the logical state transitions, that there's multiple versions of that. So you could have firedancer be the primary client, and then all the work of actually getting the block, staying on tip, and dealing with shreds and all this other networking stuff is done by fire dancer. And then the Solana's replay client can basically work behind it on an already built ledger and verify that the same result is built by both clients. And that gives you all the safety that you want, because now you have two clients. All the top validators that are like in the top 33%, can easily afford running two servers. That to them, hardware costs are pretty relevant. So that's kind of the expectation there is that they will run one primary, one secondary.
00:37:40.874 - 00:38:16.150, Speaker A: For a lot of the other folks, they can pick one or the other. So we'll have enough client diversity to give us those properties. For liveness, it's a bit more complicated. So with liveness, you could have a system where there's a bug, something is getting saturated and running out of memory, and you can switch to the other client, but if you're switching from financer to solana, you're probably going to see a performance, and maybe that's okay. In those kinds of events, it's better to lose some performance than to have a liveness failure.
00:38:16.230 - 00:38:16.522, Speaker B: Great.
00:38:16.576 - 00:38:28.190, Speaker E: Appreciate that background. In terms of local fee markets, I've seen you kind of tweet about that quite a bit. And like, isolated fee markets, can you just explain what these things are, how they work, why they're important for the user experience?
00:38:28.340 - 00:39:25.174, Speaker A: Yeah. This is what plagued us last year, and we didn't have an option but to innovate, which is really cool. So the problem that you have with blockchains that have low fees is that bots that want to take advantage of an economic opportunity, like an NFT mint, they will submit infinite number of transactions because it's very cheap to generate and send them. Very few of them will actually get through, but they will basically prevent anyone else from being able to propose a transaction by saturating the mem pool, all the queues leading up to block production with dummy data. So what happens is that in that environment, you have these malicious actors that are economically incentivized. Just submit. At one point, we saw literally, I think, close to 100 gigs, gigabit worth of traffic hit one of these nodes.
00:39:25.174 - 00:40:05.438, Speaker A: So these are like saturating the line like the network cards at the data centers to handle the traffic going in. And the majority of this vast, vast, vast majority of this traffic is dummy replicated transactions. They even modify them a little bit to break the deduplication, like the simple deduplication filters. So all of this stuff is saturating the network and the validator can't drop them fast enough to get to the valid transactions. So you needed like a couple of pieces fixed there. One is you needed the ability to limit the amount of traffic that anyone can send, and that's quick. So we changed from UDP to quick.
00:40:05.438 - 00:40:52.266, Speaker A: So now bots can't just send 100 gigabits worth of data, they can send some limited amount. Of course at that stage, bots will then create 1000 different bots. They're all sending a little bit of data. So to deal with that, you have to actually limit the amount of connections that anyone gets based on stake weight, and that kind of distributes that problem across the entire network. So bot can't connect a million like Sybil nodes to the leader, that could connect a few, and then maybe they can connect to other nodes in the system. But because we have a very large network, like over close to 2000 stake nodes, it becomes a much harder problem to saturate the entire thing. So anyone that has a connection to a stake node is guaranteed some ability to send traffic through.
00:40:52.266 - 00:41:44.122, Speaker A: And because now you have some guarantee that valid users get their traffic through the validator, when they receive this data, it's now bounded, they can actually sort it and drop it. And this is where the localized fee markets come in. So the way Solana works is that it's a peril runtime, it can execute a bunch of transactions, but if all the transactions are all hitting the same NFT mint, or the same liquidation for borrow, or a really hot, I don't know, market in orca, you can only fit so many at a time in a block, even if you have other block space. It's simply because these are all dependent on the same state, like the same chunk of memory. So those transactions have to be sequential. There's no way to parallelize them because they're all touching the exact same spot in the state. So you can kind of think of it as like a hotspot.
00:41:44.122 - 00:42:37.582, Speaker A: Like everybody wants the same NFT mint, that one chunk of memory that's identified with that NFT mint, that stores like the state of that NFT mint is the hotspot. So you can only fit a certain amount of those. So the way that the sorting works is that takes the highest transactions by fee and fills them out up until that little state that's a hotspot fills up and the amount of work it can do, but that's not the entire block. So that's the amount of work that any single thread can do. So like any single thread on your cpu or whatever, it can take 400 milliseconds to work in a hotspot, but then you fill up all the other spots after that. So what that means is that you can have a very hot NFT mint, like you're going to see with madlabs. And the fees to access that may spike, but that's not going to impact any other marketplace, any other transfer, because they're simply not interacting with that state.
00:42:37.582 - 00:43:02.402, Speaker A: And that means they can be scheduled. So because validators now have a bounded amount of data that they can actually do the sorting and filtering, they can actually then bucket all of these transactions by hotspots, and then take the top hotspots and put them into a block. So it's like a pachinko machine. It's just like filtering all of these things into slots and then taking the top ones. And that happens to be your block.
00:43:02.466 - 00:43:25.214, Speaker B: This is a really exciting solution here, and I'm curious if you can go a little deeper on how they identify hotspots. And so I guess in the example you gave, right, like mad lads will likely become a hotspot, but that doesn't necessarily mean every other NFT mint that's simultaneously going on will be a hotspot, as it like, I guess. How do you actually distinguish and group these transactions into these clusters, if you will?
00:43:25.252 - 00:44:02.874, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's a pretty dumb greedy algorithm. So it actually sorts everything by fee, and then going from the highest fee, it starts tracking which accounts those transactions. Access. So one thing that's very different about Solana than Ethereum is that if you've heard of access lists on Ethereum, it's that they're required on Solana, and they have to be complete. So transaction cannot access any data outside of the access list, and a transaction has to have its access list declared. So that means that looking at every transaction, you could look at which access lists are being accessed by each transaction. Right.
00:44:02.874 - 00:44:12.682, Speaker A: So when you're doing this greedy algorithm, you take the highest ones, and then you start tracking which access list fills up first. And as soon as that one fills up, you don't allow anyone else to access it.
00:44:12.736 - 00:44:33.522, Speaker E: Okay, that makes sense, I guess. I think we're missing a small piece because you mentioned how Solana is kind of designed with hardware in mind, and parallel processing is also another thing you've already mentioned. So do you mind kind of explaining at a higher level how parallel processing actually works, how it scales execution and the benefits or trade offs associated with it?
00:44:33.576 - 00:45:14.278, Speaker A: Yeah, so the tricky part is that the system has to be parallel in every step of the way. If you have any single cube that's single threaded, and I think it's saturated, you kind of lose benefit in the entire system. And there's a lot of detail to explain there. But fundamentally the key part that we did is that we parallelized the environment, the execution environment, the virtual machine where transactions are executed. So unlike EVM, you can think of every transaction in EVM has like a global write lock on the entire state. It can touch any part of the state, it can do whatever it wants, and then it executes, and then the next one gets to do the same thing and it's all done very sequentially. On Solana.
00:45:14.278 - 00:46:06.286, Speaker A: Every transaction specifies exactly what state it's going to read and what state it's going to write. So reads can overlap, but writes cannot. And this is where the scheduling algorithm and how we do replay is that you look at all the sequential operations for any given state and you can put them all on one thread, and then you take all the other non overlapping stuff and put them all on the next thread and so forth. So then you have multiple threads executing all of the state transitions in the runtime. So that gives it that fundamental level of parallelism in the core execution part. And then from there you have to make sure that the scheduler itself can handle the parallelism and that the mempool can handle the parallelism and so forth. Because if one of those ever fails, you end up having a sequential system that's bottlenecked.
00:46:06.286 - 00:46:47.934, Speaker A: So one thing that folks don't realize is that this is the best you can do. You can't actually improve upon this. It doesn't matter if you have zero knowledge, vms or layer twos or layer threes or whatever. What happens in databases and in systems like this is that it's called the database hotspot problem. Everybody wants to access the exact same state. So when you have everybody in the world that wants to flip the same light switch, if you have 100 people that all want to flip the same light switch, doesn't matter how many light switches you can flip in parallel because everybody wants to flip only that one light switch. Doesn't matter.
00:46:47.934 - 00:47:43.770, Speaker A: If you make the light switch flipping 1000 times faster, somebody wants to go first and that causes a hotspot. That means that you have to prioritize who gets to go first, who gets to go second. And this is where that localized fee markets resolve. That is that people can bid to access first. Now, the problem on Ethereum and EVM and mempools, the way they work today, is that if you have one switch where 100 people want to flip it, and then you have a totally unrelated thing like an oracle update or an NFT mint, they see the block getting filled up with high paying transactions that all want to touch that light switch, that all want to go mint that one NFT. But oracle updates still need to happen, and people that want to liquidate still want to cash those liquidations. So they now try to outbid that entire use case to be included in the block.
00:47:43.770 - 00:48:16.998, Speaker A: And that causes this gas war between unrelated use cases because there's no parallelism in the mempool. Because there's no parallelism in the runtime. And as soon as you add that, you're not going to fix that lack of parallelism with l two s because the same thing can happen in optimism. You have an NFT mint in optimism and a liquidation happening at the same time in the mempool. There you're going to have a gas for and fees are going to go up. So the only way you can do this is like actually with transaction isolation, what Salana does. And once you do that, you have that parallelism established.
00:48:16.998 - 00:48:32.042, Speaker A: Your only other kind of thing that can impact fees is just throughput. And there add more hardware every two years, every 18 months, roughly, hardware gets cheaper. So things will always kind of tend to get towards zero for the base fee.
00:48:32.106 - 00:48:49.030, Speaker E: So it sounds like you're not exactly bullish on the idea of scaling ethereum through roll ups, but I think a common rebuttal to that would be like, well, you're going to have app specific roll ups. You're not going to have an NFT mint on an app specific roll up. That's just a Dex or something like that. How would you respond to that?
00:48:49.100 - 00:49:32.930, Speaker A: Yeah, so like cosmos and very application specific environments that only do one thing. That's like a way to do that, but that's not a generalized, like, that's effectively kind of very crude level of isolation. You can literally do the same thing on Solana. You can have a program specific circuit that's like a ZK prover that's optimized for that one thing. Am I going to call it a layer? Like it's not right? I think the program specific stuff is cool, and I think will work everywhere. And that actually does solve a problem, but it's not, I would say, like a general solution, that you can say, this is the way to scale these systems to the entire world.
00:49:33.000 - 00:50:02.954, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's a fair take. You also mentioned that you kind of see these gas wars that happen on Ethereum, but ultimately that leads to Ethereum's core value accrual in terms of burn and mev, that accrues the validators and ultimately stakers. How would you say Solana thinks about this problem? Because that's how Ethereum's tackling security. I've heard you mention that you don't think sol, the token, is money, and you don't want it to ever be money. So I'm curious how you think security works long term for Solana.
00:50:03.002 - 00:50:31.522, Speaker A: I think those are totally unrelated concepts. I think security comes from operator security, is the physical security of the network. Is the security of the network. The token itself is virtual. It doesn't actually do anything. So it doesn't matter how much of it is burned, because an attacker can acquire the keys to the voting infrastructure for the network for free, through remote code execution, through all sorts of other attack vectors. So the actual token itself is meaningless.
00:50:31.522 - 00:51:06.686, Speaker A: What matters is how many independent parties you have that have secure operations that maintain their state of these systems. And what's interesting, you could have an unstaked node, can provide tremendous amount of security. Like circle, they have billion dollars on Solana. They need to secure their node to make sure that that node is not corrupted. They don't give a shit about how much stake is on that node. It's totally relevant. They have a business reason to make sure that their node is secure, and that is actually more value than all the stake in the world.
00:51:06.686 - 00:51:57.278, Speaker A: So fundamental security of the system is that the number of operators that are independent, that give a shit, that they have high secure infrastructure, making sure that that state is never corrupted. So I think security is like a totally separate subject. The gas wars that occur on Ethereum are extracting value from the use cases that are running on it, from the users, from the liquidators, from the actual Mav bots. If you think MaV is a net positive, the gas is actually taking away from it, and it is giving it back to the Ethereum holders. But I think over the long term, there's no way that level of extraction survives mass adoption. It's just not how technology works. I think if you have like 100 million users, they're going to be very price sensitive to fees.
00:51:57.374 - 00:52:11.426, Speaker E: So there's a few roll ups, two that come to mind, eclipse and nitro, that are looking to deploy the SVM as l two s. How would you say your take is there, considering you're generally bearish? The idea of scaling a base layer.
00:52:11.458 - 00:52:29.334, Speaker A: With l two s, I think it's awesome. Honestly. I think people are going to be building l two s. They should be using SVM. The runtime is better. It's actually parallelized, I think offers a better programming environment because it's using rust, a modern language. Not only that, it's using LVM.
00:52:29.334 - 00:53:07.954, Speaker A: So all the work we're doing to add move and solidity support is available to all those folks. So myself as like an open source maxi nerd, it's awesome. It's licensed under Apache license. For that reason, we want people to go take the code and go build products with it. Now, whether I think that environment is going to be as good as Solana layer one, that's a different thing. But all the work that they're putting in ultimately feeds back to upstream. So if they find bugs, if they find improvements or build better tooling, I think all of that is, I think an app good for the entire ecosystem.
00:53:08.082 - 00:53:40.130, Speaker E: In terms of security as well. Back to that topic. I think a lot of ethereum people would also say, well, you don't really have any at home validators when it comes to Solana. It's mainly people with large server access or whatever it is and the resources to actually spend on the hardware. So how would you respond to that in the case of a regulatory backdrop, or crackdown, I should say. Or basically any scenario where the network needs to fall back to at home validators.
00:53:41.430 - 00:54:33.854, Speaker A: So one thing is that people way overestimate how hard it is for the government to crack down on at home validators. First of all, the isps that you're connected to, Comcast at t for home connections, all those companies are effectively extension of the federal government. They're federally subsidized, they have to get their licenses from the federal government. And the amount of users that they would have to shut down is very small compared to their total user bases. Like Comcast is not going to care if they kill every home. Like if there was a real regulatory crackdown, home validators in the US will not survive, and very unlikely, I would say, in majority of the world. So from that perspective, I don't think there's any advantage.
00:54:33.854 - 00:55:15.746, Speaker A: Anecdotally, there's already home validators on Salana simply because you're starting to see one to ten gigabit network connectivity at home, just from the general upgrades. So I think that's kind of happening on its own. But I personally believe that for these systems to scale, they have to be highly available systems. And when you look at Salana, it's in over 200 individual data centers. Like the network is in more data centers than most networks have nodes. So it's very much distributed around the world. I personally believe that crypto, if it's going to succeed, it's going to succeed in the United States.
00:55:15.746 - 00:55:34.098, Speaker A: And I don't foresee a future where us has a massive crackdown and there's even a point to a high performance blockchain. It's basically going to be like bitcoin, like monetary maximalists waiting for the rapture of the US dollar collapsing.
00:55:34.274 - 00:56:11.342, Speaker B: Yeah, fair points there. And so as Sam mentioned, there's definitely that Solana catches heat for that and the way I'm starting, and also as Sam mentioned, we've been on this modular tear for a while and the ideas of a shared sequencer system. But in my mind, when you start adding roll up after roll up after roll up onto the same shared sequencer, the hardware requirements to run and participate in that shared sequencing system is eventually going to hit a point where is it going to be drastically different than the requirements to run a Solana validator? So I'm curious what your thoughts look around the shared sequencing landscape.
00:56:11.486 - 00:56:57.300, Speaker A: Yeah. When people say it inherits the security of the layer one, they don't actually mean that me as a layer one user that I magically have layer one security on that roll up. The roll up could run invalid state transitions. And if there's no full nodes, there's nothing me as a layer one user will be able to do. So me as a layer one user, to get pure trustless execution, I have to run my l one node and my l two node to make sure that if l two causes a fault, that it's submitted. Now, it's a little different with zks, but still the provers are inscrutable. You have to run like a classical version of the same computation to make sure that the prover didn't screw up.
00:56:57.300 - 00:57:42.030, Speaker A: There's trusted set up. There's all these other issues that may be solved in the next ten years, but not right now. So if you consider that, then you're running multiple nodes, they have to be high available systems. You could run a Salana validator right now for $350 a month. It's like you're looking at the cost effectiveness of each now, I think things are much more interesting with light clients and things like that. Which systems are more suitable for light client proofs. And getting the idea that when you have at least a large user base of node providers that are running these for business reasons, that at least one of them is honest, and that is enough to guarantee shared security of the system.
00:57:42.030 - 00:59:01.334, Speaker A: This is what you get as a layer one user. This is what you should be getting as a layer two user as well, without actually running any nodes as well. But either you can do this socially, you can literally go into the channels where people that run these systems work and keep an eye on things, and you receive a transaction and you wait like 8 hours, nothing blew up, right? Nobody's claiming that there's a fault, it's probably okay, but it's better when these systems are automated with protocols and you can get these guarantees within 30 seconds or a minute. And I think from that perspective, when you have system like Salana with a bunch of big validators that are trying to maximize that number of full nodes, so at least some set of them are honest. Working with light clients, that provides a very high security for the vast majority of users. And that is I think very competitive to low cost validators, but a bunch of effectively high compute cost l two nodes that users still need to have protocols to get these shared security guarantees. The trade offs are like, from my perspective, it's actually easier to analyze salana because you can look at it and say, okay, there's like 2000 full nodes.
00:59:01.334 - 00:59:35.874, Speaker A: A bunch of them are businesses that are running this, that have valid reason to run this, not just like getting tokens from staking rewards. One of them is going to be honest, right? And all I need is a protocol to make sure that that signal gets propagated. If something happens so long term, I think the light clients will kind of eliminate the gap in what the normal user gets as security between all of these networks. And that performance and finality will be the main things.
00:59:35.992 - 00:59:59.900, Speaker B: So I'm curious, how do you think about transaction fees as a whole? Right? So if we look at Solana, it's known for its high throughput, low transaction fee model. And to the end user, do you really care if once a transaction is say below $0.01, is there any difference if it's like 100 of 1000th of a cent at that point? Or are you over optimizing for MeV at that point?
01:00:00.270 - 01:00:47.434, Speaker A: Well, the central limit order books, the market makers and the pith oracles, they care about the fees because they do submit over 20 million transactions per day. So that starts to add up. I think they would like to see the fire dancer team. Their goal is to get us to that over 100,000 tps steady state. That means that fees can even drop even lower and they can put more data on chain for people to trade on. And to them, that would be really cool, because that impacts their normal business. If there is a public data store of all the Nasdaq trades that's now being piped to Solana, I think that would impact their bottom line and a lot of trading firms bottom line.
01:00:47.434 - 01:01:35.658, Speaker A: So I think reality is that as these systems scale machines are going to be accounting for 99% of the volume, users are going to be like, users are going to have very low fees. The cool thing is that a user can pay ten times more to outbid everybody, like all the bots, and get very high level of service on salana, and it's still less than a fraction of a cent. So you can ten x your fees always as a Salana user, and you get highest priority above the average transaction and it'll have no impact. That, I think is that kind of level of performance is what we really want to provide, is that users have the option to get really fast service still at a very low cost. But the network is a data rich environment with lots of participants doing stuff.
01:01:35.744 - 01:01:50.638, Speaker B: Right. No, that makes a lot of sense as well. And I want to kind of take the conversation to dive in on the state of MeV on Solana. So I'm really curious just to kind of get your overarching thoughts before we dive into more of the specifics. What is the landscape of MeV on Salana today?
01:01:50.804 - 01:02:19.578, Speaker A: So jeto, I would say, is like the leader there. So they have a stake pool. I think it's over 20% of nodes are running on cheeto client. So they have like a searcher network that's optimized for finding those opportunities and that submit bundles into the network. It's awesome because they are like creating client diversity. They have their own build of the Solana validator. So now there's not like a single failure point of where you're going to get your source code from, which is, I think, really important.
01:02:19.578 - 01:02:51.182, Speaker A: And they're very smart engineers and they're very much performance sensitive. So as many of those folks as we can get, looking at the code and optimizing and testing, I think, ultimately results in better outcomes for users. And it's like having that as a transparent part of the ecosystem, I think is very important. Because I don't think there's any way to really get rid of MEB. So making sure it's transparent competitive is what's going to result, I think, in the best experience for the users.
01:02:51.246 - 01:02:58.866, Speaker B: So do you think something like enshrining PBS proposer builder separation is like a path that you'd like to see Solana pursue?
01:02:59.058 - 01:03:59.506, Speaker A: Yeah, we've had this idea. We called it multiple leaders per slot. It's been kind of part of the genesis of the Solana design, is that if we have multiple block proposers proposing at the same time, then the user can basically send their transaction to the one that's offering the highest Mav rebate. So these proposers are then competing for user transactions, and they're like an average seeing x returns, and they're like, hey, send me all your flow, I'll give you a rebate. That should be like the end state of Mav, is that the proposers are very much optimized, I don't know, maybe running massive GPU farms, trying to figure out what is the triangulation bundle best outcome. So that's something that's been, I think, part of our intent from day one. There's a proposal right now, we call them SiMDs and the Solana Foundation Repo, that actually is pretty close to the proposal.
01:03:59.506 - 01:04:01.538, Speaker A: Build a separation that you see on Ethereum.
01:04:01.634 - 01:04:11.518, Speaker E: Now, I saw you put out a tweet. I can't remember when it was, but you were saying that Dapps could actually recapture some of this mev. Is that exactly what you were just referring to, or. That looks somewhat different.
01:04:11.604 - 01:04:54.886, Speaker A: So that's a bit different. So one of the things that we see is that there's a lot of opportunistic arbitrage spam in the network. So basically, if you have financial state in these systems and you have x amount of capacity, right, or x amount of access to that state, arbitrage will fill it, the entire capacity of that state. If the transaction fees are low enough, and that's actually fine, we don't really care. So they're like submitting a bunch of transactions. 99% of those ARB transactions fail because they're opportunistic. Hey, if this price is x, just happens to be x, and I get lucky, then I know this is a profitable transaction.
01:04:54.886 - 01:06:00.874, Speaker A: So why don't I submit it? Because the cost to do that is pretty low. One of the ways that we thought that could benefit applications is if they could charge these transactions just for taking a write lock to the state. So if a transaction wants to access mango, it's an arb that's like, hey, I'm trying to see if there's like a price on mango that I want to take, but if not, the transaction fails. But just even asking that, querying that state and taking the write lock, it has to pay mango a certain amount. Then mango can tune their fees to basically capture this opportunistic arb returns. Mango itself can capture it and give it as a rebate to users that are creating valid bids and asks that are adding liquidity to the system. So from a very high level, you can think of it as like your traditional exchange that gives people that are creating liquidity a rebate, and those that are taking liquidity paying a fee.
01:06:00.874 - 01:06:38.858, Speaker A: So this is kind of like the system that we want to create at the low level because that's very hard to do at the application level itself. Because from a high level outside the app, I can submit my arp. If the application doesn't do what I want, I abort the transaction. It means that the entire state transition is canceled and bingo, doesn't get anything. So this is kind of like what we want to undercut is the ability to do that by these opportunistic arbs. And then they can actually do this balancing act. Okay, we can set our fees a little higher, and that means that there's going to be fewer arbs, or at least the Arbs are paying more.
01:06:38.858 - 01:06:45.882, Speaker A: And then we give a rebate to everybody that's adding liquidity. And that, I think creates a better environment for users and traders.
01:06:46.026 - 01:07:05.010, Speaker B: I love how you're approaching MeV in this fashion, right? Like instead of worrying about the moneyness of soul, the MEV is flowing back to the application and the users that are generating it. Is that broadly your thesis there, instead of the token, rather focus on the users and the creators of this mev?
01:07:05.690 - 01:07:54.100, Speaker A: Yeah, I think ultimately what's good for the creators and the programs and the users is good for the network. I think that's actually, I think better, more sustainable approach for growth. Because while it seems like you're getting a return, right, like, oh, more eth is burning, as soon as everybody stops using it, it doesn't matter how much eth you burn prior to that, it's irrelevant. All that burn is useless. It's not like a battery you're charging. Does that make sense? As soon as people no longer use it, the network is dead. That's actually what happens, right? So what matters is how do we create an environment where these businesses can grow, grow, as fast as possible, attract the most users they can.
01:07:54.100 - 01:08:11.686, Speaker A: And from that perspective, I feel like the protocol should be the least extractive anything in code that we can do to make it more efficient, to give it more capacity to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks. Right. I think that all of that is on the table.
01:08:11.798 - 01:08:26.858, Speaker E: So more broadly speaking, I think there's a good chance that the future is multichain. So I guess what is your guys'strategy in terms of communicating with other virtual machines in a secure manner?
01:08:26.954 - 01:08:40.660, Speaker A: I think the only chains that survive in a multichain world are the ones that believe that they're the single chain. To survive, you have to go for gold for glory, right?
01:08:41.510 - 01:08:42.660, Speaker B: I love that.
01:08:44.390 - 01:09:50.694, Speaker A: The way that we're approaching the multi chain like, multivm thing is that Solana is using the LLVM stack, so the bytecode that it's using is a backend to. So like there's a project to compile, move through that stack. And what's cool about that is it's forcing us to add next generation features into the back end, where now the bytecode is typed, and you can do type inference between different programs and then combine them during the jit stage. And then you can have calls between these programs that don't need to have any safety checks, that you have a guarantee based on the bytecode that when I call the token program that I'm passing the right data. That means you eliminated a whole bunch of runtime checks and things get faster. So that's been really cool, just having move as a forcing function for us to add all these features that the Linux kernel folks added to Berkeley packet filter a couple of years ago. So that's basically our approach.
01:09:50.694 - 01:10:20.562, Speaker A: LVM is very general purpose compiler. I can't imagine it like, not being able to do something like that, that people come up with in the virtual machine space. There's a solidity project too, called Solang, that's like, I would say fairly mature, but still takes a lot of. An experienced engineer would need to be able to use it, because a lot of the kind of the basic tooling like hard hat is still missing. But if you're like an experienced solidity dev, you can get going with it.
01:10:20.616 - 01:10:36.360, Speaker B: I honestly love that mentality. This is the right framework to be attacking this idea. But I'm curious, what do you think the Solana ecosystem is missing today, as far as applications go? What would you love to see get built there?
01:10:37.530 - 01:11:09.202, Speaker A: I think it's kind of what all of crypto is missing is there's no application that we can point to and say this is general consumers using crypto and getting value out of it. And these are the business models that are creating value for the world. There's nothing here. We're trying to attract folks that have that mindset that really want to unlock value for the general consumer. Helium I mentioned is one. Hivemapper is another one. Folks don't know what that is.
01:11:09.202 - 01:11:39.818, Speaker A: They're basically competing with Google Street View. They have hardware cameras that are on devices. People are effectively mining tokens by creating these constantly updated streets. And it's a really cool product because their updates are coming in 200 times faster than Google's. It's kind of crazy because they have these drivers that are constantly mining and there's 60 million road in the world. They're over a million already. So they're moving really quickly.
01:11:39.818 - 01:12:41.370, Speaker A: Right? Like 2% of the way there for the entire world. I think that could be very substantive technology built using decentralization that we can point to and say, hey look, this is competitive with a $2 trillion company, but it's still not like consumer stuff. It's like infra, similar to helium. What I'm excited about right now is backpack and dialect, I think are new approaches to crypto where they're trying to basically build something similar to Wechat where you have social and finance all mixed together and they're taking two very different angles on it. I think dialect is very mobile. First chat app, Backpack is a wallet with a lot of unique and cool interactions you can do, including social. But the goal there is, if you have a moderately successful social network that's struggling to raise money in Silicon Valley with like 20 million users, would be the biggest success in crypto.
01:12:41.370 - 01:13:17.690, Speaker A: We can all then point to it and like, look, there's real consumers, they're doing stuff, they're making payments, they have simple returns on stable coins or something like that. Right? It works. The whole loop works and it's growing. If we get one of those successes, I think that would be revolutionary. And once you have that many users that are actually using this stuff on a monthly, daily basis, then I think the business models that make sense will just become very obvious and fast to optimize and you'll see that next generation. All of that is missing from crypto. It sucks.
01:13:17.690 - 01:13:27.242, Speaker A: I've been working on this for over five years and we still can't point to that one use case that's like, that's a consumer use case. That's the winner.
01:13:27.306 - 01:14:01.634, Speaker E: Yeah, strong agree there. Me and the rest of the research team have been preaching on that front as well. You could maybe argue stablecoins as a potential killer use case for crypto. I think that's probably the only one, but at the application layer it's few and far between in terms of backpack too. I was very excited to see 2048 flappy Bird like some of these classic web two games in there, like kind of obfuscating the difference between web two, web three. I thought that was super cool and super unique. But as someone who's so bullish on their own project, which I absolutely love, I would love to hear the bear case.
01:14:01.634 - 01:14:07.690, Speaker E: Like, at what point would you admit defeat and be like, damn, I was completely wrong on my thesis on how to scale blockchains.
01:14:08.270 - 01:14:51.430, Speaker A: Oh man. Well, I don't think I'm going to be wrong on scaling part. I think we have to for me to question it. I'd like to see Ethereum and all the l two s combined to even match what Salana does from applications today. Reality is that Salana does more transactions than all of their scaling combined right now. I think for that to happen you need like think protodink sharding might get close to that, but I'm doubtful because it's just one of the pieces you need to really optimize the mempools as well. And I don't know how much work is being done there, and that's going to start touching the execution environment.
01:14:51.430 - 01:16:08.350, Speaker A: Unless you do all three of those pieces, you're going to have these weird bottlenecks that they're not going to quite work well together, but at least that looks promising. They're focused on increasing the data availability layer, but that's ultimately the bottleneck is the bandwidth between nodes. Can you maximize that? So I think proto dank sharding might get at least closer. I guess I would be impressed if the post tank sharding, if the throughput of that system was anywhere close to fire dancer, I think I'd be like, okay, this is very much a valid scaling solution. I think probably my guess is that fire dancer is going to be like 100 x. It's really hard to compete with an optimized server at a data center with ten to 100 gigabits worth of available bandwidth, and it's very hard to compete with that system, right? It has all the cores, all the raw resources. The only bottlenecks right now on Salana are like our stupid code that we wrote as fast as we could to launch that's not fully optimized.
01:16:08.350 - 01:16:40.778, Speaker A: And the fire dancer guys don't have that constraint. They're actually building it the way it should have been from scratch, from the ground up. So software is the only bottleneck right now. The hardware is ridiculously fast and not expensive. We're not talking about like $100,000 servers. This is literally like $350 from latitude. Sh is like very large core system that can do 10 million of Ops per second on a single core.
01:16:40.778 - 01:16:54.938, Speaker A: This is how fast hardware has gotten today. So I have my doubts that even post stank sharding that it'll be anywhere close to a well optimized network like Solana running on good hardware.
01:16:55.034 - 01:17:14.710, Speaker B: Well, no doubt it'll be a fun race to watch. And I really appreciate you taking some time today and coming out and sharing your thoughts on, really, your viewpoints from the boots on the ground vantage. We love, love to hear it from that perspective. So I'd love to give you the chance to kind of tell the audience where they can learn more about you, Solana as a whole, and anything you want to kind of leave them with on what to be watching out for.
01:17:14.780 - 01:17:42.426, Speaker A: Go buy a phone@solanabubble.com. It's so easy to advertise. Other than that, go to Solana.com. You can learn all about Solana and what we're doing. But yeah, if you want a phone that actually opens up web three to developers so they can do whatever they want and build awesome experiences and applications, go check it out. It's actually, like the best Android build I've ever seen. The titanium shell.
01:17:42.426 - 01:17:46.510, Speaker A: My guess is that Apple is going to copy it for their next device.
01:17:46.930 - 01:18:02.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I've used the phone, and I got to say, seeing the DAP store directly next to the Google Play Store was such a zero to one moment for me. Everything felt real again. And I'll definitely recommend go get this phone. But again, thank you. Thanks a lot, Anatolia. Appreciate it.
