00:00:00.330 - 00:00:16.400, Speaker A: Absolute make or break moment for the cosmos. Like 100% because you've got Adam just now reducing inflation, you got Noble USDC, and you've got DYDX incentives kicking off. If this isn't enough to get people over to that God forsaken ecosystem, like, I literally don't know what will.
00:00:18.610 - 00:00:42.334, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. If you're listening to this podcast, there's a good chance that, like Dan and I, you believe the future of finance is on the blockchain. And we're excited that London is becoming a global hub for blockchain innovation and institutional adoption of digital assets. That's why we're pumped to host the 2024 Digital Asset Summit in London this March. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. Later in this episode, we'll tell you how you can save 20% off on your ticket.
00:00:42.402 - 00:01:09.838, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We have an awesome interview lined up today with a couple of members from the Blockworks research team, Ren and Zero X Pebbles. But quick reminders, these will be in the show notes. Get your ticket to the digital Asset summit in London in March of next year, and also be sure to check out blockworksresearch.com, where you can use code Zero X research ten for 10% off of your annual subscription. Dan, do you want to kick off the episode this week with some movers and losers?
00:01:09.934 - 00:01:44.382, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So got some interesting movers this week. We'll start with Makerdao, who actually has a revenue all time high according to the stats collected by DFI llama. So according to this data, they're doing about 500k in daily revenue, which is pretty insane. And again, in the heat of the bear market, that seems a little bit crazy to think on the surface. But when you look into what maker Dow has been doing over the past few months, you start to uncover that they spent a lot of time in RWA, so it's really no surprise to any listeners of this podcast. And then given the expansion of that, that kind of makes sense.
00:01:44.382 - 00:02:21.914, Speaker C: But one interesting thing I found was, at the peak of the last bull run, Makerdao's die outstanding, or the amount of borrowed die was at an all time high, around nine and a half billion. And right now, that's only around four and a half billion. So it's like 40% lower than what it was at the peak, yet it's making more revenue. So that's kind of an interesting takeaway. And honestly, I want to dig a little deeper into that, because if that's true, then it really is kind of like Makerdow doing more with less. I think a lot of that can be powered by just the 5% yield that's coming through these rwas. So that's definitely an interesting takeaway on the surface level.
00:02:21.914 - 00:02:44.240, Speaker C: And because of that, I think the actual token itself has had this really interesting negative correlation to the rest of the market, where it's almost been this flight to quality, and it's like, oh, we see a market pullback. Everyone's like, okay, back into maker, this is the safe RWA yield play, and then we get some positive catalyst and everybody wants to pile back into the next major token running.
00:02:45.750 - 00:03:41.060, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's really nice seeing a protocol's revenue at all times higher in the death of the bear market. One thing I'd be cognizant of is that eventually, hopefully, as interest rates start coming down again, and maybe all of us might be able to buy a house on a mortgage sometime in the future, Makerdao's RWA yields realistically probably come down too. And I'll just be wary that in terms of their RWA portfolio, they don't start sort of going out further on the risk curve to sort of chase higher yields in order to sort of maintain, because I think a lot of people are a bit, I'm not sure spoiled is a good word, but I think it's an apt word to use here by this guaranteed 5% yield that's being funded by us treasuries. But once interest rate comes down. Right, if you want to find the same 5% yield, you're going to need to go a lot further out on the risk curve, and generally that doesn't end well for people who chase this yield. So, yeah, just be cognizant of that.
00:03:43.350 - 00:04:05.980, Speaker C: Yeah. And defi llama, of course, absolutely goaded. But it is notoriously hard to calculate the RWA yield just given the off chain on chain elements and using different service providers. Each vault is its own beast. So I do need to look a little deeper into exactly how they're calculating it. But again, the zero X NGMI and the rest of the crew over at Defi Llama always does a kick ass job. So would expect this to be definitely close to right.
00:04:05.980 - 00:04:29.154, Speaker C: Moving on. We got another mover this week, actually have three. So the second one is going to be vertex. The token launched a couple of weeks ago and then did an LBA to kind of find a natural market price without the true market volatility. And the trading has been live for about a week now, so it's been interesting to watch that kind of develop. And the LBA seems to have worked super well for the protocol. Right.
00:04:29.154 - 00:04:46.920, Speaker C: So they launched at about $0.30, fell down to about 20 or so cents, and now it's up to about $0.50, which seems to be working well, I think. Sam, you're kind of our in house Vertex expert, so I don't want to start rambling too much here. I'll kind of throw things over to you to talk a bit about vertex and where they're at, right?
00:04:49.050 - 00:05:36.422, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, we talked about it a little bit on last week's episode, so if you want, like a more in depth overview, I'd definitely go back to that one and give it a listen. But I was just mostly surprised to see volume over the weekend, which is typically lower volume periods, basically three to four x from anywhere from 200 to 400 million a day, all the way up to one and a half billion on Monday, November 27, as we're recording. So that's just wild, especially considering the amount of open interest. It's only like ten to 15 million versus one and a half billion dollars of settled volume. So I don't really know what to make of this. I don't know if it's market makers kind of juicing the volume numbers, but nevertheless, 30% to 50% of those fees paid are going to be going to stakers every single week.
00:05:36.422 - 00:06:02.800, Speaker A: So I expect this to pretty much continue. And it's honestly a very reflexive system in the sense that as the VRTX token price goes up, so does the dollar value of the incentives, and then people want to pay more in fees so that it increases yield, but it also goes reflexive the other way around as well. So we're about to see that with DydX, which I'm sure we'll talk about briefly a little bit later. But nevertheless, that was definitely a very good play for those who traded on Vertex in the early days.
00:06:03.330 - 00:06:34.346, Speaker D: Yeah, just to add on a bit there in terms of sort of volume divided by open interest, someone posted a table on Twitter for vertex. 24 hours volume divided by 24 hours open interest is at 129 x. For DyDX it's at 2.33 x. For GMX it's at zero point 77 x. So it's a pretty big difference compared to all of these other perf Texas. And as Sam mentioned, there's like a lot of catalysts going for it.
00:06:34.346 - 00:06:58.180, Speaker D: I think tomorrow, Tuesday, the staking APR will start displaying on the protocol. You have the Arb sort of fee rebates right now, but yeah, I think on paper it looks good for now. Just because you being able to say that you have more volume than UiDX is like a pretty big move, but it just doesn't look that organic to me for now.
00:06:59.590 - 00:07:14.070, Speaker E: Yeah, I think Vertex is awesome and I think it's going to continue to eat GMX's lunch. And then another really neat thing with it is the elixir integration. So I just think the model is going to be a lot more interesting and reflexive to the upside.
00:07:16.330 - 00:07:52.034, Speaker C: Definitely one to keep an eye on, but we'll kick things over to our third and final mover of the week, which is honestly just gaming tokens as a whole. That's been a hot narrative for a while now. All of your favorite vcs have been making their marketing push about it, and honestly, the games are trending in the right direction. We did a segment in hot seat cool Throne last week kind of covering some of the interesting games. So again, referring back to last week was a great episode. Check it out. But as far as movers go, prime has been killing it, Ori has been killing it, IlV has been killing it as well, and those games are getting a little interesting.
00:07:52.034 - 00:08:20.490, Speaker C: And I feel like crypto gaming kind of segments people into two camps where it's either this is the worst idea I've ever seen in my life, or this is going to be like the second coming of Christ for the crypto market. And so I'm curious to get everyone's take on it. We had a nice Sunday night debate in our group chat the other day, so I'm curious to get your take on. Do you think crypto gaming is here to stay, is going to work? Or is this just like the next narrative that needs to get chased?
00:08:21.790 - 00:09:13.280, Speaker E: I like the gaming tokens. I think something that's pretty interesting about all three of the ones we're talking about is they're all essentially up like three x of the bottom in the past few months, and this has coincided with the actual games going live. So, like, Alluvium's going live on the Epic Game store tomorrow. Arroyo also got listed on the Epic Game store and that game went live, I think, last week. And then you have prime showing off all this colony stuff and they've had the trading card game live. So I think these tokens can really be bear market proof if they find a sticky enough user base and what will be more interesting to track on these tokens is what the actual usage metrics look like and the average playtime per gamer and how the momentum carries on.
00:09:14.930 - 00:09:58.822, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll say that. I think traditionally there's been two sort of large type of game developers. One is like the large AAA studios that are able to shed out like 10 million or like 100 million on one AA title. And then on the other hand, you have sort of like these indie game developers who are able to launch super fun, slightly more niche games. Probably the most prominent example is like Stardue Ratty. It's just one man grinding for like six years on building an incredible game. I feel like crypto gaming, gaming on blockchain, whatever the term is, kind of enables that indie side of developers a lot more in terms of bootstrapping their game economy or the game network effects.
00:09:58.822 - 00:10:44.060, Speaker D: More so for games with assets that have tangible value, or game with multiplayer modes, just from sort of like the token incentive perspective. But also I think mobile games are like a huge thing in Asia. It's honestly probably as big as gambling. The number of degenerate 18 year olds who spend half their lives in a pc cafe or like a land is pretty incredible in China. And the government has had to go to pretty drastic means to cut down on gaming activity. So honestly, I wouldn't fade gaming even if it doesn't make any sense to put on the blockchain. And if you see zero reason for it to be on the blockchain, I think overall it still does really well.
00:10:47.070 - 00:11:37.674, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I think the tokens are going to perform really well. I don't think we'll get a game that's like widespread and hits the mainstream to the point to where mom and dad are playing it. But I do think the tokens will do well because we don't really need that much new demand in order to make tokens go up. So bullish on the tokens, not really bullish on the quality of games. I did see something interesting earlier today with prime, and I haven't looked into it super deeply, but it looked like they're planning on doing something that ties token emissions to the amount of prime that's actually sunk on different cosmetics, collectibles, et cetera. I think that's a really great idea, to not have a fixed supply schedule for a game and actually tie it to the amount of token demand that you're seeing at that given moment in time, versus trying to just hard set the inflation rate and just hoping that everything times up.
00:11:37.674 - 00:11:41.370, Speaker A: Well, I think it makes a lot of sense to tie that stuff to new players.
00:11:41.790 - 00:12:20.006, Speaker C: Yeah, I love the idea of dynamic incentives and not just saying like 1000 tokens each month. Here you go. Whatever happens, happens. I think that was very like a gen one DFI strategy because it was easy to code and that's kind of the way you start and then you build things and it kind of just build on top of and rework these different things and just keep iterating. So definitely excited on that dynamic inflation idea as well. The other thing we mentioned, prime and their colony game. This is like this interesting intersection of AI and gaming, which I don't know if this will be interesting at all, but I could see a game where you control AI agents to go do things.
00:12:20.006 - 00:13:15.402, Speaker C: I don't know, that definitely seems like it has potential. And they're saying that colony is going to be a fully multiplayer game, which is really cool. There's even been clips or quotes from some of the developers saying, we're going to try to leave some of the code to be written by the AI engine, which is like, okay, the self progressing game with AI agents. That's definitely interesting. And Axie Infinity was kind of the first game to popularize the play to earn model, which has since been proven to be a little bit gimmicky and quite frankly a bit silly. But I think that you could kind of see that same narrative, that same style of narrative forming with this AI and gaming overlap and having a game where you're controlling different agents, it sounds a little gimmicky as well, but I could see it being. Ending up being something kind of fun, honestly, and kind of like creating this little colony, I don't know, the clips I was calling them, like, you get these little AI ants, you get to control.
00:13:15.402 - 00:13:19.034, Speaker C: And being in a colony, I don't know, it starts to make sense to me.
00:13:19.232 - 00:14:01.740, Speaker D: I think my bet there with autonomous AI agents in games is that human loneliness is like an all time high across all age ranges. And I think a very natural extension of, or a very natural use of AI is sort of like having a buddy you can talk to. But I think rather than having a buddy that you can talk to in Siri or Google voice on your phone, I think it makes a lot more sense in a gamified setting. And so that's kind of my thesis around gaming and AI humans are lonely. You'll be able to not be so lonely in a gamified settings with AI agents and maybe some actual real life friends.
00:14:02.990 - 00:14:32.820, Speaker C: I mean, gaming is social too, right? The only games I play in nowadays is strictly to talk to my friends. It's just fun to hang out online on a Sunday afternoon or something, so I can definitely see that forming. That's a good flag, ran. It's a little bit depressing when you start to kind of back up and think about it. But for the biggest loser this week, we have Tornado Cash's native token. It was delisted from finance. I'm sure this is some, I don't know, but I would have think this is some fallout from the whole CZ lawsuit and the settlement of about $4 billion.
00:14:32.820 - 00:14:43.270, Speaker C: I think delisting what is probably the US government's least favorite asset was probably somewhere on the fine print there. But I don't know if you guys have any more thoughts here.
00:14:43.420 - 00:14:45.970, Speaker A: Nah, let's move over to hot seat cool throne.
00:14:46.130 - 00:15:20.914, Speaker C: All right, let's do a little hot seat cool throne then. And before we jump into that, I'll give a quick shout out to Das London here. It's definitely going to be a super exciting conference. We have a great speaker lineup listed with names like some of the companies like Onyx, which is Morgan's crypto arm, Morgan Creek framework Ventures, winter mute, Stannie from Aave is coming, and now that they've rebranded, I'm pretty excited to see kind of what their new vision is and how that ties into this narrative of institutionalizing the industry. So it's going to be in London this March. Be sure to come join us. Some people from our team will be there, some people from the rest of the blockworks crew will be there as well.
00:15:20.914 - 00:15:32.280, Speaker C: Would love to grab a pint with you, so be sure to shoot Samurai a DM if that is going to be you. But moving on to a little hot seat cool throne. Ren, I'll kick it over to you to kick us off.
00:15:32.810 - 00:16:26.066, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So I got CCTP in the cruise throne this week on November 20 eigth, which is tomorrow for us, but it's going to be yesterday. When you're listening to this podcast, CCTP will be going live on Noble. For those who are not too familiar, Noble is a general asset issuance chain within the cosmos ecosystem and it will allow individuals to sort of mint USDC and utilize IBC to transfer that USDC across the cosmos ecosystem. One of the largest beneficiaries of CCTP and Noble will be DyDX. Since DyDX is an app chain, users will basically be able to mint native USDC directly on DyDX and more importantly, transfer that from various Ethereum based chains such as Ethereum itself. Arbitrary base and optimism.
00:16:26.066 - 00:17:18.994, Speaker D: CCTP is also live on Solana Defnet right now, and I think there's an increasing narrative taking place around the death of liquidity based bridges. We're starting to see that already. Even at the start of this year, bridges such as Stargate had their volumes sharply fall off, albeit it was pretty influenced by a potential airdrop farming opportunity. Synapse has definitely not been doing so well, but just CCTP and sort of intent based bridges have been taking liquidity based bridges market share. So for example, on Socket, which is a bridge aggregator, CCTP share has been steadily increasing from like zero a few months ago to 25% today. And across is also a bridge whose volume has been absolutely rocketing. I think they just overtook Stargate volume, Stargate Bridge volume today, actually.
00:17:18.994 - 00:18:11.510, Speaker D: And so how an intense bridge work is basically someone submits an intent, I want to bridge 1000 USDC from chain a to chain b. Some filler or relayer comes in and funds the liquidity, and then after a while they'll get paid. Once you're verified that you've received the tokens on the source chain instead of like a liquidity based model where the bridge sort of acts as like a crosschain deck amm. And sure you get kind of like instant liquidity, but a lot of time you get a lot worse execution. And so what a lot of these intense space bridges, sobers or relayers are probably going to do is they'll fund the liquidity and then they'll probably use CCTP to sort of transfer that risk on the back and to refill their inventory. And I think that's just a very natural progression. People are really sick of bridges getting hacked.
00:18:11.510 - 00:18:37.220, Speaker D: Probably like top five of the crypto hacks are bridges today. Billions and billions of dollars have been lost. And so intense based bridges, as much as I hate the buzword, like intense, are probably going to be the future, especially when combined with CCTP. And if you're saying like CCTP is like a centralized service piece of infrastructure, I really don't think that's the worst thing in the world, to be honest.
00:18:38.230 - 00:18:42.050, Speaker C: What does this mean for all non intense based bridging models?
00:18:42.950 - 00:19:25.250, Speaker D: I think you're going to get cooked. The only real bridges with real liquidity will probably be like smart contract, like the smart contract bridge for roll ups. Those will actually have a large amount of TBL. If you are a liquidity based bridge, you better be integrating CCTP ASAP or sort of developing a product that's sort of like an RFQ like intense base model, just because over time, intense based models are probably going to provide you with a better execution and b faster execution. And so there's literally no reason not to use an intense base bridge for a user.
00:19:25.670 - 00:19:39.654, Speaker A: Is there increased latency associated with using an intense base bridge? Or is that what you're saying by market makers, inventory managers kind of facilitating this with instant settlement for you when they kind of settle in the back end, I guess.
00:19:39.772 - 00:20:31.160, Speaker D: Yeah, I think if anything, there's probably like decreased latency, and it's a lot more gas efficient just because there's a lot less calculations involved. The latency risk or the additional latency is on the silver and relayers, and a user bridging does not have to care about that. So perhaps a server will fund the liquidity and only after one or 2 hours they will get the bridge funds on the source chain, and then they will manage that inventory however they want. But I think you're likely either a market maker who has an inventory already, or you're probably borrowing those funds on the destination chain for a really small fee, like 0.1% of one bips or something for one or 2 hours.
00:20:33.530 - 00:20:50.494, Speaker C: Yeah, that was great Ren. I appreciate the insight there. It's definitely something to watch. With the rise of CCTP, I'm most interested to see how that kind of impacts dy DX now with the easy access bridging to get there, no excuses to not really see v four volume pick up in kind of ev three. I need to check in on what those stats look like.
00:20:50.532 - 00:21:33.580, Speaker D: I would also add in terms of CCTP, I think today bridging across ecosystems from Ethereum to Cosmos or Ethereum to Solana, or vice versa, especially Solana back to Ethereum is not that present of an experience. It's hard to find a bridge sometimes. There's a lot of slippage on that bridge. So I do think CCTP could sort of be the key unlock, especially for Ethereum, Solana Solana Ethereum or like Ethereum Cosmos. Cosmos ethereum volume. Just because for your average users today, it's a pain in the ass to try to find the correct bridge from Ethereum to other ecosystems. But with CCTP, most front ends will just integrate it and it would just be like your normal bridging experience.
00:21:33.580 - 00:21:57.780, Speaker D: You click, I want to transfer a thousand USDC from Ethereum to Solana, and CTP just does it. Sure, there may be a bit more additional latency, but it just works. So I do think CCTV is a bit of a game changer and I wouldn't be surprised to see that the market share or the bridging volume driven by CCTP continue to increase, just like forever. To be honest.
00:21:59.750 - 00:22:34.714, Speaker A: I agree with that. Ren. Last thing I'll say about this, I sent a spreadsheet that had a bunch of different bridges and routes to go from different chains, and it was from the last bull market. And one of my buddies was like, hey, I was trying to get over to Solana using that bridge sheet that you sent me two years ago, and I'm like, dude, half those bridges are hacked, no longer active, have zero liquidity. I was like, I don't know what you're doing. This CTP just makes that user experience so much better. There's no reason someone should have to find the newest bridge that actually has liquidity if you're coming back into crypto after a long hiatus.
00:22:34.714 - 00:22:37.754, Speaker A: But that's just my take, so definitely agree with you, Ron.
00:22:37.802 - 00:23:04.914, Speaker B: All right, zero x research listeners, we're calling on you to join us for the premier institutional crypto conference in Europe's crypto capital, London this March 2024.

00:23:31.482 - 00:23:36.050, Speaker A: And be sure to hit up Dan and I for a beer. Pebbles. You want to take the next hot seat or cool throne?
00:23:36.390 - 00:24:34.530, Speaker E: Yeah, so I have a hot seat, and it's Justin's son, who has been exposed to a little over $200 million worth of hacks in the past two months. And I think it's really sus and I don't necessarily think these are real hacks. I kind of feel like they're inside jobs. And my tinfoil hat says that these hacks are like him, shuffling around money to take care of something. And maybe that relates to CZ, maybe it doesn't. But one thing that is super odd is with the bridge hack last week and the Polonik's, if that's how you pronounce it, hack a few weeks ago, both of those immediately preceded a huge, probably a billion dollar top on e futures prices and perps. And so it's, like, super inorganic.
00:24:34.530 - 00:25:05.920, Speaker E: The perps just happened to put in a God candle the next day for both of these hacks. And then. So I'm curious if he's actually hacking these himself, then pushing price up with perps and then offloading his stolen spot funds. But it's just a weird development, and there's no concrete evidence to support either way. It's just, if you're in crypto this long and you have that much money, how are you exposed to this many hacks, all back to back?
00:25:08.210 - 00:25:51.498, Speaker C: I think we're also been conditioned to think where there's smoke, there's fire, and if anything can't be malicious, it will be. So it's, like, definitely something to that's worth considering. You flagged that chart of the e futures twap, which I thought was crazy. The timing is definitely interesting, and the size is certainly there, but I have no basis to say whether or not he did or did not do these things. But it's definitely suspect. And I'm glad you kind of flagged that, because the reason why I found it interesting was like, oh, well, we've been on a nice little ripper here, but if it's just from one person pumping the market, and we all like to rely on the narrative of, no, it's because the bitcoin ETF is. It's like, oh, maybe there's something a.
00:25:51.504 - 00:26:48.720, Speaker D: Little deeper here on the topic of, like, Justin sudden. Obviously, Tron is kind of his baby. I think one interesting thing that you could look for is, before the start of the previous bull market, what were people holding USCt on Tron doing? Were they, like, bidding eth on Tron? Were they bridging that USCT on Tron to other ecosystems to buy other things? Because there's, like, a very sizable amount of USDT on Tron these days. If I'm not wrong, it's like, I want to say, 67 billion. And if the same cycles play out and the same user behavior plays out, it definitely could be something interesting to watch, because I'm of the opinion that no one has any clue what goes on on Tron. And I still kind of believe it's just like a lot of chinese people escaping capital controls. But, yeah, it'll just be an interesting thing to check out.
00:26:52.120 - 00:27:15.630, Speaker A: Yeah, to your I just. Everyone always talks about the USDC market cap is down only and USDT is up only. That's really sketchy to me. I think there's something more there that we'll probably see looking back in a couple years, like what was actually going on here, but I guess that probably won't happen until we get another doomsday moment similar to the ones we had in the past. So I guess I'll just sit on my hands until then.
00:27:18.320 - 00:27:32.850, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's a good flag as well. I think the USDC market cap has finally bottomed, but I guess I'm biased since I already publicly tried to make a call, and I think I'm down a few hundred million since that. But Sam, why don't you give us your hot seat cool throughout this week?
00:27:34.580 - 00:28:17.916, Speaker A: Yeah, this one's easy. Everyone's talking a lot of shit on crypto Twitter about the new l two blast from the blur team. There's $570,000,000 locked in that deposit contract controlled by a three or five multi sig, and they don't actually have an l two live, and they will not be unlocking those funds until February at the earliest, I believe. I mean, this is just complete comedy in my opinion. If you look at all of the different l two s that have launched over the past year, you've got op stack l two s linear polygon, Zk evm, ZK sync era scroll. You can combine the Tvl of all of those new l two s and you're sitting at around the same TvL as what's in this deposit contract controlled by a three five multi sig with no product. I get the hype.
00:28:17.916 - 00:28:50.680, Speaker A: Pacman is a great founder and they've got great ambitions with NFT perps and an NFT focused l two kind of similar to immutable, but more targeted at the more general purpose NFT landscape as opposed to gaming. But I don't know, man. I don't really see why people are depositing into this. At this rate, you're hardly getting any airdrop or points or whatever with 570 mil, unless you're like a giant whale. So as a retail participant, I just don't see that as positive. Ev. Dan Robinson from paradigm, who backed blur, came out condemning the strategy.
00:28:50.680 - 00:29:10.160, Speaker A: It's basically just a gamified l two experiment experiment with native yield generating tokens by taking stuff locked in the bridge contract and applying staked eth yield as well as USDC yield from other spots. So I don't know about this one. I'll definitely try out blast once it comes out, but I'm not depositing in the near term.
00:29:11.460 - 00:30:06.896, Speaker D: I think definitely the marketing is a little city, and I think the whole points and referral thing is also a bit overdone. But I think there's two points I want to make. First is that I think the rise of yield bearing tokens are inevitable in crypto. Everything that has a yield bearing version will become like a yield bearing version. And so eventually I think the amount of stake defusing defi or Si over normal die will just continue to increase. So I don't think it's like the worst thing in the world to take the e for the dai or stable coins locked in the roll of contract and depositing that for some yield, since it's probably something that crypto as a whole will drift towards too over the long term. Obviously there's very questionable things surrounding that bridge contract.
00:30:06.896 - 00:30:55.428, Speaker D: The three or five multi sig, four of them are funded by the same wallet. But I think that's the first point I wanted to make. And the second point is that on the whole points and referral thing, sure, it's very ponzi like, but I don't think I blame pac man for doing know. It's kind of what you have to do to stay competitive and lean into the fact that crypto participants are just complete. Djens, if you were launching any protocol and you had a competitor protocol, you would definitely be running like a points and referral programs just because of the benefit that gets you. Sure, there's probably like an extra boost because this is like a paradigm invested. L two, I don't think blast TBO will be that high if paradigm did not invest in it.
00:30:55.428 - 00:31:42.096, Speaker D: But yeah, I think it's just kind of like the natural evolution of things. And I do think that it's possible that blast is open like a pandora's box, right? Because individuals from arbitram and optimism did come out before saying that this is something that they had thought about and explored. Now you're letting some sucker make the first move, let the community backlash wash over. And then sooner or later, when everybody wants a yield generating token of everything, it kind of sets like a baseline for these alternative or these other LTC events. You say, hey, okay, look like flash has been doing it for six months. One year we can generate, I don't know, an extra like 100 million a year for the Dow. We're going to do this.
00:31:42.096 - 00:31:51.190, Speaker D: I honestly wouldn't be too surprised to see one more large l two do this in 2024. I think that's my take.
00:31:51.880 - 00:32:23.760, Speaker C: Yeah, no, those are great points, Ren. And on the multi sig risk, that just doesn't bother me from a risk standpoint. Personally, I'm like you, Sam. I won't be going over there until there's apps over there that are interesting and fun to use. But you can't say that the multi sig has you bent out of shape and then go use arbitram, which has a security council. Yes, sure, they're docs, but is that really the make or break for you or optimism that has an anonymous multisig that has bridge control? It's the exact same thing. It is a deposit contract.
00:32:23.760 - 00:32:53.636, Speaker C: You're not just giving funds to multisig, it's a deposit contract that is owned by a multisig. That is the same setup as a bridge contract owned by a multisig. But the thing I'm most bothered by is certainly the regulation or the marketing, which is going to bring the regulation. Canon further pointed towards us. There's $500 million in this thing, so it's already on the radar. And then on your website, you have things that say you're pre rich, right? When you click the wallet page, it's like you're pre rich. You have to connect a different wallet.
00:32:53.636 - 00:33:42.792, Speaker C: You don't have any airdrop points yet. Calling people pre rich, horrible idea how the invites work. That page really just made it look like a Ponzi scheme. But I also really hate our industry's usage of the term scheme. There's a very clear definition of a Ponzi scheme, and this is not that you're not paying the new guy with the old guy's money, but it is still malicious marketing. And that just really grinds my gears because we already have people in, half of Congress hates us, the SEC hates us, and it's like, do we really need to just give them more firepower? Like, I would prefer not to. And I do think that l two s, if they want to meet these high valuations that they have, are going to have to figure out a way to bring in more revenue because somebody's going to slam their margin on transaction fees to zero.
00:33:42.792 - 00:34:32.676, Speaker C: And when that happens, you're going to have to see if users care if they pay one cent or fifty cents for transactions. Personally, don't think they will, but that's definitely a possibility. And if it does occur that users do care and they will use the cheapest chain, then you, as an l two, you can't be charging $0.50, so you have to slam your margins to zero as well on transaction fees. So how else are you going to make revenue? And this could be a way, but one thing I saw kind of under discussed was they're going to use rebasing tokens to deliver the yield from the bridge to the token. Rebasing tokens, they don't play well with most of DFI. There's a reason why Lido staked ETH created wrapped staked ETH to have more of that exchange rate model where the value of the token increases as opposed to the amount of tokens that you own and hold in your wallet.
00:34:32.676 - 00:35:11.104, Speaker C: Right? With a rebasing token, you just hold the token. If I have one, and I earn 5% over a year, and now I have 1.5 in my wallet without any transactions. And those don't play well with many dexes or lending markets, a little more so, but that creates extra development work, and so that's not necessarily great if you want to see blue chip d five protocols just forked onto your protocol. Then again, it doesn't seem like that's what they're going for. They want to create their own little casino world, and if that casinos exist in the real world, then there's no reason for them not to exist in these economies as well. So Netnet, for me, it's just like disgusting marketing.
00:35:11.104 - 00:35:55.956, Speaker C: But at the end of the day, the risk assumptions aren't drastically different from other l two s today. And it's kind of a cool model, like depositing the underlyings that's going to open up a whole new world of risk. And how they go about managing that will be very interesting to watch, because you'd have to think there was some intent based architecture, not only to queue in on the buzwords and pump that valuation, but also because there is going to be some sort of liquidity gap, right, if everybody wants to exit or withdraw their ETH immediately, and it's all deposited as staked ETH. And then there's this withdrawal gap where you have to wait through. So I imagine they'll put some market makers on the back end to kind of meet that gap. And obviously they have to take a cut as well. So it'll be interesting to see how that model develops for sure.
00:35:55.956 - 00:36:23.644, Speaker C: The only other thing I wanted to add here was the valuation numbers. So Avo launched their pre futures, and it's currently trading at 4.5 billion FDV, which is kind of ballpark for what you'd expect, really, because if you compare that to some of the l two s that exist today, arbitram is at a 10.1 billion, optimism is at a 7.3 billion, and Maddok or polygon is at a 6.6 billion. So it's kind of ballpark up there.
00:36:23.644 - 00:36:38.720, Speaker C: Maybe some risk adjustment downwards as well and as well as the fact that the l two doesn't actually exist. So all in all, it's pretty insane number, but I don't know. I guess if you were just going off of comparative valuations, it's at least ballpark where you'd expect it to be, for better or for worse.
00:36:41.380 - 00:36:43.348, Speaker A: Do you all know if blast is.
00:36:43.354 - 00:37:02.184, Speaker C: Going to be ZK or optimistic now? As far as I know, they haven't rolled out any information about their execution environment at all, which is also scary, right? Because there's literally nothing that we know and there's somehow 500 million in this contract. That's mind blowing. It really is.
00:37:02.382 - 00:37:15.070, Speaker E: They're going to pull a play out of the synapse playbook and pretend like they're innovating on the design of the l two and then they're just going to, one click deploy a conduit l two on lunch day.
00:37:17.600 - 00:37:43.232, Speaker A: I think that's actually a good take, but I don't know. NFTs just have not worked on l two s. Simply they have not. If you look at immutable x volume, if you look at Arbitram optimism volume, they're non fungible tokens. Getting those things bridged over is tough. Getting oracles that actually work is extremely tough. Maybe because Blur has this blend product and NFT marketplace, there's more that they can do from an oracle design standpoint.
00:37:43.232 - 00:37:48.260, Speaker A: But I don't know. They're definitely embarking on an extremely ambitious journey.
00:37:49.080 - 00:38:29.204, Speaker C: I also feel like they got to worry about the whole two token thing right now, that there's blast and blur, it's like, are they going to try to keep them separate? Are they going to effectively kind of meld into the same thing in the long term? And if so, it's kind of hard to say. Well, you probably should have just used one token because now you have your equity split between two different protocols that are ultimately the same protocol. I don't know. That's a question mark for me. I would like to see a little bit more about how those two tokens really align. Because if you think about another recent two token project which was velodrome then launching Aerodrome. Aerodrome hasn't done great hasn't done terrible, and velodrome is honestly kind of in the same ballpark there.
00:38:29.204 - 00:39:29.364, Speaker C: It's definitely not a one to one comparison here, but it is kind of something to consider. Instead of if you're going to launch something new, when do you have to draw the line between using the same token and launching a new token? Well, that's probably a good jumping over point to switch over to my cool throne, and then we'll end the episode on some governance updates. But in my cool throne this week, I've got Jido, aka the Lido, and the flashbots of Salana, which is a great tagline. But they announced their airdrop, so it broke down to 10% of the total supply will be used for the airdrop. And that is in total, they're going to have 34% of the total supply as community. And then the other 24% of that 34% is going to be for the Dow treasury. So Netnet, it's 66% for the team, 34% for the community, which is higher than you would hope if you were like a community allocation maximalist.
00:39:29.364 - 00:39:51.992, Speaker C: But to me personally, I'm pretty excited about this. If you just zoom out and think about this, they've built this great product. People love it. People are using it. A large portion of Solana validators are running the Jedo client, the liquid staking protocol, or, excuse me, the liquid staking token. Jeto Soul has exploded in exponential growth up to like 6.7 million sol in TVO.
00:39:51.992 - 00:40:24.520, Speaker C: And they're just saying, hey, we're going to slice off 34% of our business and just hand it to strangers. So largely, that is already insane. And so to me, the 66 34 split doesn't really bother me that 64% is split up between about 40% for team and investors. That's going to vest over a certain vesting period. We don't really have specifics around the lock period there. And then 25% of that is going to a foundation for long term ecosystem development, basically also kind of like this as well. To me, this looks a lot like the arbitrum token launch.
00:40:24.520 - 00:41:00.260, Speaker C: They did about a 10% airdrop and a large allocation to the foundation, large allocation to the Dow, and then team and investors vest over four years. To me, it's honestly not too dissimilar. I think Netnet, this has a good potential to lead to Salana users getting a couple of grand airdrop to them. And that's on top of the pith and the bonk airdrops as well. You're starting to get a little bit of this wealth effect going on from these airdrops over in the Salana ecosystem. Now, you can't really bring this up without mentioning that I'm sure the FTV on this thing is going to be batshit insane. And that's kind of similar.
00:41:00.260 - 00:41:20.380, Speaker C: Pointing back to Arbitram, right? They launched with this, like 0.1 or 10% of total supply circulating, and they have the highest ftv of an l two today. You have to imagine over the long term, as they issue new tokens, that those are going to kind of bleed somewhere towards the middle of market cap and FDV. But curious if you guys have any takes on Jito and their new airdrop.
00:41:21.840 - 00:42:09.264, Speaker D: Yeah, I would start off to say that the narrative is definitely there. Lido plus flashbots is a pretty killer tagline. And in addition to that, Jito Sol charges like an annual management fee equal to 4% of total reports. And so that fee is applied to both staking rewards and also Mev revenue. And if you told someone that there was a flashbot token where 4% of validated tips that go to the mev boost relay is driven back to the flashbot, Stao or the company, I think that token would just completely send. Granted, MeV on Salana is much smaller than Ethereum. I think there was like a 300 sold tip the other day in one of the blocks, and people were rejoicing.
00:42:09.264 - 00:42:56.776, Speaker D: That is one of the largest validator tips, but that narrative is definitely still there. And I think another thing to keep note of, in terms of the token allocation and how 25% is being held by the foundation for what I would presume would be like long term partnerships. And I think 24.3% is going to be held in the Dow treasury. For dow to do dow things, for lack of a better term, I think you kind of need so much, and you should only be giving 10% of it to the community today because liquid staking is still so small on Salana. On Salana, I think liquid staking is like 2% of total sole staked, whereas you compare that to Ethereum. I think that number is closer to, like, I want to say 60% to 70%.
00:42:56.776 - 00:43:34.650, Speaker D: So there's a lot more room for this liquid staking war on Salana to play out. And so you really do kind of need that sizable treasury in order to compete in that war. Granted, it's a bit easier these days with Lido. I'm not sure if they pulled out already or are debating putting out, but for all intents and purposes, Lido might as well be dead on Solana. They're completely aligning with Ethereum, but yeah, with other validator clients coming out marinate still being the largest TvL protocol on Solana, I do think you kind of need a lot of those incentives in order to remain competitive in the still good stake. More.
00:43:38.490 - 00:43:57.558, Speaker A: I'm pretty bearish on this, to be honest. Love Jito soul the team. I've met them personally. I love what they're doing and they've been super innovative. Love the meme of flashbots, press lido. But I think ultimately people look to Ethereum tokens to get a sense of how high things can go. Like if you own bonk, you're looking at Pepe and Shib.
00:43:57.558 - 00:44:32.440, Speaker A: If you're looking at Marginfi, you're looking at Ave and compound. That's just naturally how it goes. So I expect the same here. And Lido's fDB is two and a half billion, so I expect this thing to launch at a ridiculously high FDV and I honestly think down only is more likely than up only. That's just my service level take. I also think that with fire dancer coming out, we have no idea how that impacts Judo Soul's business model and I think this token is going to launch and no one's going to think about that. They're just going to click, buy or sell, but that'll be like a serious headwind moving forward.
00:44:34.810 - 00:45:07.860, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree with you there. I also love the judo team. I think they're awesome. I think their product is great. But if I'm looking at this strictly as a speculative investor, I have no interest in buying this token because it's low float, just like all the other cursed Solana tokens. I think the best chart you can look to for any hint at Jeto price action is to look at Marinade, which has very similar token allocation. And if you look at that chart, it's not awesome.
00:45:07.860 - 00:45:39.914, Speaker E: But then if you consider the other tokens like oxy maps, serum, even pith, none of these are really great for people to buy in secondary markets. They're great deals for Kyle salami and the rest of the vcs and they can get their bag and that's fine. But me as a secondary market participant, I'm not going to play this, but I will collect an airdrop. That's fun and thank you for that, but I have no interest in doing anything else besides that.
00:45:40.112 - 00:46:28.810, Speaker D: Kao salami is sitting at 91 million points. The person second on the leaderboard has like 20 million points. For context, I have like 21,000 points, so there's like a pretty big difference between me and Kyle Samani. I'm not sure what their air job distribution will look like, but for my sake, in a selfish way, I hope it's not just depending on how many points you have. And I think another thing that Sam brought up was actually fire dancer client. At first I was thinking in terms of, will fire dancers, like client, be more competitive with Soul's client. But another thing is that fire dancers should theoretically allow the Solana network to process a shitload more TPS.
00:46:28.810 - 00:47:16.890, Speaker D: And how Jeto works is that it introduces this additional latency through the judo relayer. I think off the top of my head, that additional latency, I honestly like 200 microseconds. Don't quote me on that, but I wouldn't be too surprised. If salana is able to support a much higher TPS, then jiro also needs to sort of lengthen or increase the latency in order to run their MEV solution effectively. I don't know whether that's going to be a problem or not, but just something to think about while Fire Dancer is being worked on. But that's not going to be a problem until H two 2024. And then in H one 2024, we're going to get like a baby version of Fire Dancer, which has a really weird name that I don't remember.
00:47:16.890 - 00:47:19.100, Speaker D: I think it's like frank and dancer or something.
00:47:24.930 - 00:48:14.686, Speaker C: Yeah. The only other thing I want to add there is, I don't know if it's totally fair. I definitely get your sentiment with the token distribution and how that's negatively impacted Solana projects, but I don't know if it's fair to compare the business model of Jito to Oxy or maps that were just purely FBF's manipulated toys, basically. But I definitely get your sentiment there, and honestly, I bring it back to arbitram. The token distribution isn't too, too different. I think the major difference was a larger allocation went to the arbitram Dow, which is sort of like a meaningless thing in a lot of ways, but that's just kind of like a way to appease the community. But you could kind of argue the same thing, right, let's just round it off and say there's about a billion Arabs circulating today and 10 billion that can be emitted over time.
00:48:14.686 - 00:48:49.580, Speaker C: A large chunk of that is going to be the team and investor allocations that vest over a four year period with a one month cliff, and then another chunk of that is going to be about three and a half billion of that is the Dow treasury. So as the Dow is spending money, it is increasing the circulating supply and bringing that circulating supply value closer to the FDV, probably pulling them both towards the middle there. And so that would lend me to believe that if your basis is the distribution and the allocation, are you excited about arbitrum as a token at all or are you thinking kind of the same thing applies there?
00:48:51.070 - 00:48:58.654, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm also not interested in arbitram token. That's why I said, yeah, fair enough.
00:48:58.692 - 00:49:05.380, Speaker C: Fair enough. Definitely a good point there, but maybe a good time to jump over to governance updates. Sam, what do you think?
00:49:07.670 - 00:49:10.020, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. You want to kick it off?
00:49:10.390 - 00:49:48.526, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll get us moving there. So on governance updates this week, we always got to talk about some of these things we've been following for a little bit of time now, but I think it's important just to kind of see them out to their completion. So prop eight four eight over in the Cosmos hub ecosystem cut issuance by about 30% by lowering the max inflation rate. Now it's set at 10%. So definitely an interesting development here. Effort capital on our team is our local Cosmos hub expert, and he was really vocal about this being a net positive for the ecosystem. Just because if you're overpaying for security at some point, you have to say, what is the point of this? I don't know.
00:49:48.526 - 00:50:34.894, Speaker C: Maybe if minimum viable issuance is the right word there of finding that sweet spot of how can I get economic security without kind of overcompensating for that and just inflating away the token. Of course, there's obviously the whole discussion around is token issuance a cost, and there's even a new one around this, not really new. Tolley's been saying this for a while, but Anna Tolle is proving to be a firm believer that economic security as a whole is a meme, and we can always just rely on social consensus around node operators that have a business reason to care about the truth. So there's kind of like this whole unfolding conversation here. But Netnet prop eight four eight has cut atom issuance. The market seemed to like it when the prop was officially passed. Of course, we've kind of retraced since the market as a whole since then.
00:50:34.894 - 00:51:19.340, Speaker C: So it's hard to really see how that shapes out. But it will be interesting to watch the market's reaction to the new atom with lower inflation. And I'm also really curious to see if this will kind of inspire any sort of chain reaction to other cosmos chains saying, hey, maybe we are over issuing and we actually don't need know. When we talked to the Akash founder Greg Asuri not too long ago on the podcast, he was actually being like, I thought he had great takes. He was like, yeah, as a, like, we have to think about our security costs and our security budget, and that's definitely something that's on the forefront of his mind. So I'd love to actually get him back on and kind of have that conversation. But curious if you guys think anything about the atom inflation cut.
00:51:19.950 - 00:52:05.174, Speaker D: I think one interesting point of this vote was that it was like, by far the most contentious vote in Cosmos history. I think there was a larger voter turnout for this prop than the Atom 2.0 vote. And I've never seen so much Atom drama on Twitter, both from validators, node operators within the cosmos ecosystem, but also just normal ct profiles that just normally don't give a shit about Adam. So there was definitely a lot of buzz on the timeline and it really did come down to the wire. Right? I think probably like a day before the vote was going to close, it was still like, no, by a pretty wide margin. And then last minute, a lot of people came, Drew.
00:52:05.174 - 00:52:48.422, Speaker D: And then it was like maybe like 39% for, 36 against, and then like 6% veto. So, yeah, I do agree on the point of that. I feel like there's going to be positive cascading effects for the rest of the ecosystem just because most cosmos tokens have traditionally had pretty high inflation. And maybe they have been using atom inflation as like, a benchmark for their own tokens inflation. And now they don't have to be as competitive given that Adam's issuance or inflation is lower, and so they themselves can lower the token emissions, too. So, yeah, I think we'll just see how it goes. I know Jquan's wilding a bit and he's proposing to split the chain and then launch, like, a new token called Adam one.
00:52:48.422 - 00:52:50.840, Speaker D: But that guy's a bit of another.
00:52:54.950 - 00:53:29.630, Speaker A: Agree with that. I can actually roll this one into another governance update. So DYDX is launching the incentives program, $20 million over six months. It's going to be a closed source system with Chaops labs, kind of like retroactively rewarding different actions, and then the community will be able to pass the analysis that chaos labs conducted and then those tokens get distributed. But nevertheless, it's fixed at $20 million usd, so the token price is variable. That'll be decided at the time of the distribution of the incentives, I think this is like absolute make or break moment for the cosmos. Like 100%.
00:53:29.630 - 00:53:55.330, Speaker A: Because you've got Adam just now reducing inflation, you got Noble USDC, and you've got DYDX incentives kicking off. If this isn't enough to get people over to that God forsaken ecosystem, I literally don't know what will. So I am pouring one out for David after two, three weeks from now. Sorry, effort capital if this doesn't pan out well. But definitely rooting for the cosmos, folks. But it's been a tough.
00:53:59.700 - 00:54:16.564, Speaker C: Think. It's because they have great tech and there's no doubt about that. And I think Dydex moving over there speaks volumes to that. It's really just a thesis for me. I think it's becoming more and more obvious now that app chains are a great end state and just not a great place to start. Right. There's a lot of other complications that you have to deal with.
00:54:16.564 - 00:54:27.550, Speaker C: If you just want to build an app, just go build it on generalized smart contract chain. Just go build yourself a smart contract system on one single shard over in Solana and take it from there.
00:54:28.080 - 00:54:44.290, Speaker A: But even, like the app chain thesis, as a mature product, you know what I mean? Like DYDX is as mature as it gets in terms of app specific stuff goes, so they're not able to pull this one off. And I just think the app chain thesis is dead. But producer, please don't shortclip that one.
00:54:46.260 - 00:55:14.124, Speaker C: I don't know, man. Your favorite DA layer just launched that promised me a world of a million chains. So we shall see. But moving on, in the governance update section, the arbitram stip back fund has passed. So this is a vote to rewind a little bit. There was a $50 million short term incentive program, or stip proposal that got passed and funded, and that is going to run through the end of the year. There was a lot of good candidates on there that had just the way the voting worked.
00:55:14.124 - 00:55:42.576, Speaker C: They were approved, but didn't receive funding, basically. And so all of those summed up to another 20 million in incentives. And the Dow has approved a snapshot vote to have a back fund and fund them with these tokens as well. And it is up on tally being voted on chain right now. Generally, if it passes on snapshot, it will also pass on tally as well and move on chain and actually be executed. So it's interesting for me, I think blockrix research as a whole. Here we are, delegates.
00:55:42.576 - 00:56:11.240, Speaker C: So, full disclosure, we voted no on this one. And sometimes I agree. Sometimes I disagree on a personal level with our decisions, as we all do on this team. And personally this one, I was for it. I think we needed to kind of just take a step back here and say, all right, we just blasted out 50 million in incentives. Let's take a step back and actually look at how these are being used. Right? If it's just a short term incentive game, then I just really struggle to think that that's like good use of funds.
00:56:11.240 - 00:57:13.824, Speaker C: Even at the end of the day, it's 50 million arb. That's not a huge number, but it's also not nothing either, right? That's just blasting $50 million of sell pressure if everybody is just going to farm and dump these, which admittedly is probably what's going to happen. If it was like gun to your head, make a decision about what's going to happen with people that are farming these essentially fee rebates, it's probably going to get farmed and dumped. And it's a question of what happens after that. Do those users stick around arbitram and continue participating in the ecosystem? How many net new users did that bring in? Personally, I think I would have like to see an analysis around that before you go funding more protocols and more projects, then. I've also seen some posts in the forums about how people are already accusing projects of not using funds the way they said that they were going to use funds. I haven't looked into the legitimacy of any of these claims, but if you increase the number of protocols you get that you're going to fund with incentives, the likelihood of that happening obviously increases as well.
00:57:13.824 - 00:57:41.370, Speaker C: And if that is happening, that's kind of another thing to have to deal with when it comes to funding stips in this manner. But Netnet, at the end of the day, stips are probably just another round of user airdrops going about it in kind of a weird way, because at the end of the day, you're just distributing out more tokens to people that are using the chain. So I don't know, Netnet don't love it. But curious if you guys have any different thoughts there.
00:57:41.900 - 00:57:55.090, Speaker D: I think just some random things to add. Some of the largest winner of this background for Volzo are gains. They're going to receive 4.5 million, arms. Stargate is going to receive 2 million. Wormhouse is going to receive 1.8 million.
00:57:55.090 - 00:58:52.050, Speaker D: I think one thing that I like to see in such future incentive programs is for it to be a lot more skewed towards helping the smaller protocols. I still feel like, a bit iffy on whether, like, say, GMX should have received 7 million out of the 50 million, like, the initial stip funding. And I feel like all of these grants would be much better suited to sort of like, incentivize and grow fund a smaller protocol than large established protocols. I'm not sure what the best mechanism to do that is, whether that's limiting each protocol to 5% of the total arb that's being allocated to this program, or some weighted thing, depending on what type of protocol you are. But yeah, in general, I think it would make sense for the next time any l two does something similar.
00:58:57.220 - 00:59:33.032, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd like to see more lock tokens. I don't really know the best design either end, but I just feel like it makes a lot of sense to give people a number on their screen that's like, all right, this is how much RB just got over the three months. And now if you're active over the next three months, these things vest linearly until you're not active or something along those lines. That's not just like, take these tokens and dump them on some decks and then leave our ecosystem when the steps dry up. So it's going to take a lot longer. Obviously, we need to look at the data and actually analyze it. Dan, you actually put something in slack earlier today that was pretty interesting on unique users versus addresses.
00:59:33.032 - 00:59:37.570, Speaker A: I'm not sure if you can kind of give us a TLDR of what you found there. I thought that was pretty interesting.
00:59:38.580 - 01:00:15.676, Speaker C: Yeah, I tweeted that chart out earlier today as well. So just looking at base zksync optimism and arbitrum and looking at their total user counts and kind of seeing how those have progressed and. Sorry, I should be a little more clear here. When I say user, I was specifically referring to the total unique number of active addresses within a given period. So on a weekly basis, ZK sync right now is seeing about a million unique addresses. And for the other l two s, it kind of varies. Recently, arbitrum has kind of had a run up in total number of active addresses, and it's right at that same number, about a million per week.
01:00:15.676 - 01:00:41.872, Speaker C: And this largely probably the timelines line up with the incentive program. So there is some credence to say, okay, this is like one data point that's pro steps. Like, all right, bringing users back onto the chain is definitely kind of the whole point of this. Hopefully they don't farm and dump them. I feel like that's like phase two. But step one is get them back on chain. And the other piece of that is like, okay, active addresses alone can be very easily gamed.
01:00:41.872 - 01:01:21.168, Speaker C: It's a bit of a gimmicky metric, especially when you start comparing across different execution environments. So like an EVM compared to Solana compared to a Utxo model, like bitcoin, very hard to compare a number of active addresses because they all kind of mean different things. There's only one message sender on an EVM chain, whereas Solana, you can have multiple signers of a single transaction. So you'd have like two active addresses attached to a single transaction. Not really what you want when you're trying to get this number of users at the end of the day. And Utxo models are quite similar. You can have like a thousand Utxos being used to send by one person.
01:01:21.168 - 01:01:56.350, Speaker C: So it's really hard to cross compare these. But because these are all EVM based l two s, it makes it a little bit easier. And so another metric you can kind of layer on to saying, all right, well, we see this huge run up in total unique active addresses, but what is the percentage of new addresses within that total user set? So a new address is just an address where their first transaction occurred in the period you're looking at. And so just taking that as a percentage of the total addresses. So Zksync is a heavily airdropped chain. That's not really up for debate, to be honest. That's very much what's happening over there.
01:01:56.350 - 01:02:47.992, Speaker C: And because of that, you're seeing a ton of active addresses. But each week they've just had down only percentages of new addresses. And so right now, they're about 5% of their weekly addresses are new addresses that have not previously used the chain. And so when you zoom out and kind of put some qualitative analysis around that and kind of look what's happening on chain, it starts to make sense, right? Like you have this highly airdropped chain where the top eight dapps by TVL are all dexes, right? They all do the same thing. They're probably all forks of each other. And so there's really no net new apps that are doing things like even base with Friendtech, that was like a net new app that brought in a bunch of users. It kind of like starts to make sense in the context of you have a ton of users on a heavily airdrop chain where there's really no net new apps, and then you see the data behind that where you're not really bringing on about 5% of net new users.
01:02:47.992 - 01:03:39.244, Speaker C: It's like, okay, that starts to all line up. And again, this can definitely be a gamed metric, just because users is a very strong word that kind of relates to a person, where an address, like one user, one person can have infinite number of addresses, and then there's a very low switching cost to using a new address. So it's kind of why these can be easily gamed, but to bring it back to arbitram. So Arbitram has seen that run up into about a million weekly active addresses, and the percentage of new users of that set is about 20. So about four times higher than what you're seeing on ZkSync, which is kind of like our base case of a heavily airdropped chain with no net new apps. So it is kind of a good thing to see active addresses running up and the number of net new addresses still kind of being at that 20% mark. And just for context, that 20% mark is where arbitram, optimism, and base all kind of sit.
01:03:39.244 - 01:03:59.590, Speaker C: So Zk sync is really the outlier here at that lower 5%. So I think there is some steps or some data points that prove to snips are net positive. It's just a question of for how long, right? I mean, they're designed to be short term, but if you can get some extra long term incentive and increased activity, then that's really the ultimate win here, I think.
01:04:00.520 - 01:04:30.204, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely agree. Thanks for sharing that, too. That was very helpful. And I like that data point just because it's going to be tough and interesting, too, to look back in three, four, or five weeks after January 31, or whenever the incentives go through and seeing whether or not activity falls off, because I do know optimism has had problem with that. When op incentives are live on synthetics, everyone trade on synthetics. And then as soon as they stop, it's like, all right, let's go over to the next farm. So I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
01:04:30.204 - 01:04:44.604, Speaker A: But I think that's a pretty good place to call it. I don't know if anyone else has any closing thoughts. Dan pibbles. All good. Thanks again for coming. All right, cool. Thanks for coming on, guys.
