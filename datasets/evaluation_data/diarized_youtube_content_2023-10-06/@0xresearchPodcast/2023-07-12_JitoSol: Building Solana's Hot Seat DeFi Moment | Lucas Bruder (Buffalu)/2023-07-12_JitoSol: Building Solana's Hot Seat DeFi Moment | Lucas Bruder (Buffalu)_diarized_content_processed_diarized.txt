00:00:00.330 - 00:00:31.074, Speaker A: Salana is. There's certainly sacrificing, like, some decentralization. I think, at least in the current state, you can't really run. I could probably run a validator from home, but, like, the average person can't. And so I think that is okay in my mind. And I would rather have, like, this l one that's just super composable, super easy to use. And as someone that studied computer engineering in college, just like, super fascinated with computers.
00:00:31.074 - 00:00:51.630, Speaker A: And there's a lot of chains that are kind of ignoring the most efficient way to do computation and move data around between servers. And so I think that is super interesting and I think super underexplored.
00:00:54.210 - 00:01:23.730, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. This show is made possible thanks to our fantastic sponsor, the Atom accelerator. If you are a developer looking for a home in the industry, the atom economic zone welcomes you. Today is July 10, and we have a great interview lined up with Lucas Bruder, the co founder and CEO of Jeta Labs. But as always, before we get into the interview, we're joined by two members from the Blockworks research team, Ren and Zero X pibbles, to discuss the latest market happenings. Ren, why don't I kick it over to you for your hot seat or cool throne?
00:01:23.810 - 00:01:24.054, Speaker A: Sure.
00:01:24.092 - 00:02:12.566, Speaker C: I got someone in the hot seat today. Someone is Arkham intelligence. So Arkham intelligence has gotten a pretty good reputation, I want to say, over the past one year or so more. So taking over Nans'spot as sort of like an on chain analytics platform to track flow of funds, wallet addresses, and whatnot. Today, they announced their on chain intelligence exchange. Basically, it's a marketplace where anyone can buy and sell info about blockchain wallet addresses, about flow of funds. And how it works is that if you're looking for some info, you can place a bounty for that, and then anyone that has that info can sort of pass and offer that information up, and then once it's verified, you get the bounty that was originally agreed for.
00:02:12.566 - 00:02:57.494, Speaker C: I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that. But where things start getting a little hairy is in the twitter thread of their announcement for their Arkham token, they talked about how de anonymization is a destiny in crypto markets and will serve as a foundation for self regulation of the crypto economy. And if you've been through crypto at this point, part of probably why you're in it is so that individuals can have the privacy that we think we all deserve. And Arkham's core mission is bullet point number one in their newly released white paper. Kind of goes against all of that. And then they also released the tokenomics for the Arkham token. 20% goes to core contributors, 17.5
00:02:57.494 - 00:03:32.654, Speaker C: goes to investors, 3% goes to advisors, and 17.2% goes to a foundation treasury, which I think will be controlled by Arkham themselves. It doesn't sound like a Dow treasury just because of the word foundation makes it sound like a bit centralized. That adds up to around like 60%. So yeah, just bad vibes. I think everyone still wants a privacy and on chain analytics platform coming out here saying, hey, our goal is to de anonymize everyone. Every wallet address will be doxed and have an associated name or email.
00:03:32.654 - 00:03:34.030, Speaker C: It's just not a good look.
00:03:34.100 - 00:03:51.186, Speaker D: I think what would be a good idea to ignite some ponzi nomics with their token is if you don't want your information docs, or if you want it removed from the platform, you have to buy the token and pay with the token straight to their treasury.
00:03:51.298 - 00:04:45.302, Speaker E: Yeah, this kind of brings up the broader point of this docs to earn paradigm that they're kind of creating. Definitely a bit OD and CT is in an uproar about it, understandably so, given how anonymity is pretty popular in our industry, and that's probably produced a lot of harm, but honestly, it's probably done a lot of good as well. People definitely feel more comfortable saying and speaking truths when they can kind of do so while anonymous. So a bit interesting to kind of think from that perspective, but I think Arkham's getting a ton of backlash here. And it's not like, I guess you can hate the person doing it, but people are kind of coming at them for being the ones to dox people. But if you can already be doxed on chain, then it's not them doing it. The information is already readily available.
00:04:45.302 - 00:05:08.318, Speaker E: Of course, creating a marketplace to assist in the creation of that and pushing that information forward is one thing, but I don't know. I definitely tend to not like this, especially given they haven't really been seen in the best of light, really, as it pertains to their token. Why does an intelligence platform need a token is probably a very fair question.
00:05:08.404 - 00:05:38.040, Speaker B: I don't know. On the other side of the coin, I think it's kind of cool that they built a product that people actually like to use and they're trying to incentivize certain user behavior with a token. It's an actual kind of interesting application of using crypto with a product. But I agree, Dan. It's kind of like, what is the actual point of integrating a token with this thing? So I guess we'll see how it pans out. But I at least give them some credit for trying something different, even if it doesn't really support something that we want in particular.
00:05:38.890 - 00:06:23.666, Speaker C: Yeah, I echo the sentiment that token doesn't really make sense. A stable coin makes much more sense. And I would guess this token price is going to be volatile as hell. I do think one area where an intel to earn model can be applied is in the world of finance. There are super shadowy hedge funds out there that pay for satellite images of jewel Oscar parking lots, or they use it to track local weather conditions, or they use it to track shipping port sort of activity, and they use that to predict trades and sort of like, there are long or short positions. That feels like a potential avenue for intel to earn. Sort of like grassroots marketplace.
00:06:23.666 - 00:06:42.382, Speaker C: That definitely seems like a good application, but something about this is about the wrong way. But I agree with, like, if someone can dox you, then you've kind of failed already. You've been doxed. It's just that someone has figured it out. There's nothing that wrong about someone just passing that information to someone else for a price.
00:06:42.516 - 00:07:32.480, Speaker E: And let's also not forget that one of the core reasons for a blockchain is to improve transparency. So if you're coming to an open ledger to perform shady actions, that was probably a bad idea in the first. Like, you got to be aware that that is a core value proposition here of a blockchain. And the privacy chains are something people are trying to figure out for this very reason. We just had a podcast with Sonny from osmosis, and they're like, how do we build a more privacy focused Dex? That's one of the questions that they're toying with and trying to build. So there are still people focused on privacy, and I think there'll be a pretty interesting market for privacy focused blockchain solutions. But that's just clearly not what ethereum or many of our largest layer ones are today.
00:07:32.480 - 00:08:33.358, Speaker E: But I guess the other point here is how do they go about people tying outside information that's like, say, off chain information to an address on chain? Because I feel like this does incentivize just from some truly bad actors, like exploiting email addresses and things like that, especially at a time when it feels like, to me at least, Twitter spam is at an all time high, and you got to really be careful about and mindful about the links you're clicking. It doesn't really feel like a great time to be pushing forward for people to kind of wish bad things upon other people. I guess this conversation is semi adjacent to prediction markets when they first became a thing where like, okay, well, now you're kind of getting in the territory of putting prediction markets on other people's lives. That's clearly a bad thing. This feels like a bit less extreme version of that, but at the same time, killing an anonymous self is really doxxing them. So it's kind of interesting.
00:08:33.524 - 00:08:33.854, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:33.892 - 00:08:59.554, Speaker B: If I had to guess though, this is going to be one of those things where the token launches, it goes to zero. Everyone stops talking about this in a week. And honestly, I've never even seen screenshots of the Arkham intelligence dashboards anymore on Twitter, so I don't know nothing burger. And I think they completely kind of destroyed their user base in one. Yeah, I think that's a rightful spot on the hot seat.
00:08:59.602 - 00:09:00.018, Speaker A: Ren.
00:09:00.114 - 00:09:24.622, Speaker E: If you are looking for an alternative though, there's a platform called Watchers and I'll put that in the show notes. I've been toying around with it recently and it seems to be doing a pretty good job. I'm not ready to go all in on this being my Arkham slash Nansen tool. I kind of use all three at the moment for just varying things, but it's definitely a smaller project worth checking out. So again, I'll try to get a link to that in the show notes.
00:09:24.686 - 00:10:20.722, Speaker D: I've got a cool throne to offset that. And that's Stargatelayer zero. It's done a ton of civil volume and it actually just had a nice little move this morning someone decided to ape 10 million into the perps and they started moving the token. There was like a GitHub comment that was posted, I want to say like two or three days ago, and it said that zero, the new token, will be used for gas fees. And the most recent interview they've had with anyone from Stargate says that Stargate V two is one to two months out. And it's understood that the zero token will actually launch when Stargate V two happens. So stuff to keep an eye on for at least the next few months.
00:10:20.856 - 00:10:59.758, Speaker E: Yeah. I'm curious to read more about Stargate V two. I haven't heard too, too much, but it'll be interesting. As you mentioned, the Sybil volume is incredibly clear, but it gets increasingly interesting what else the V two version will offer. Right? Because I don't know, Ren, you wrote a great report on the future of bridging once Circle's cross chain and messaging platform is kind of live. So I'd love to get your take on do we really need another bridge or a more popular bridge, or kind of will that role of bridging assets across different blockchains kind of fade into the background once CCTP goes live?
00:10:59.844 - 00:12:23.270, Speaker C: Yeah, I think just bringing another bridge multi chain, which obviously got hacked for roughly $130,000,000 at the end of last week. I feel like a lot of these bridges people are finding out that at the end of the day they are controllable or directly managed by a multi sig wallet. All of the largest bridge hacks like Ronan was a multi sig thing. Potty Network got hacked like 566 or I think 600 million BNB chain like 566,000,000. Probably more than $2 billion has been lost to bridges today. And it's always like some centralized entity doing some funky stuff or avoidable human error, I want to say. So I feel like the bridge space has kind of gotten to the point where you shouldn't be asking, how trustless is this bridge? Just accept the fact that perhaps most of your bridges are going to be centralized, but who do you want to trust more? And as far as new bridges go, such as CTP, I think it makes sense for the token issuer to also be the one operating the bridge, because sure, it's like an additional centralized vector, but also provides you a lot of leeway in terms of the fact that if something goes wrong, the token issuer can freeze the USDC that's been traveling through the bridge.
00:12:23.270 - 00:13:25.598, Speaker C: If something goes wrong, they can reissue USDC to repay people that got screwed over in some way because they've frozen it. So like the underlying collateral effect. And I think the space will, over time converge, at least for bridging, and especially for stablecoins, converge to sort of centralized bridging solutions. As far as other bridging solutions for non centralized stablecoin tokens, I also feel like an increasing proportion of that bridging flow will be routed or solved through a centralized bridging solution like CCTP. I think one area that I'd be interested in seeing with Larry Zero, whatever zero token they're announcing is that they raised 120,000,000 in April, and at that time it was for a pretty big apex gaming push. I have no idea what you would use like layer zero for gaming for, but I'd be really interested to see if those announcements have anything to do with that?
00:13:25.684 - 00:13:31.934, Speaker D: Yeah, there's so many details left to uncover, so definitely be super interesting to keep an eye on it.
00:13:31.972 - 00:14:38.562, Speaker B: I can take a stab at the hot seat. Next, I've got Antonio from Dydx, and I don't really know if this is going to end up being a hot seat or a cool throne, but I've been talking about DyDx on the show a few times over the past few months, so I feel like I got to throw him in the hot seat, even keel. But basically earlier today he tweeted that DyDx is going to be punishing validators who extract MEV through a metric that accurately and statistically measures MeV per each validator using the execution price of fills in their blocks. So basically, over a long period of time, if certain validators are offering worse execution for users, that means they're extracting MEV and then they could potentially be slashed. But this slashing mechanism isn't actually enshrined into the protocol. It would be left up to either governance or. I'm not really sure exactly who's going to be in charge of making these decisions around slashing, but I think the general idea, if I understand correctly, is more so social consensus and making sure that the validators know that MEV isn't going to be tolerated if you want to be a part of their active set and earning those trading fees and inflationary Dydx rewards.
00:14:38.562 - 00:15:01.770, Speaker B: So, I don't know, I guess I just kind of expected more of an MEV mitigation just at the actual protocol layer than I did this kind of soft rollout through social consensus. So I'm sure they're going to iterate it on it over time. And obviously this is an insanely hard problem to solve. There's a lot of different teams working on it, but nonetheless, I just kind of expected a little bit more.
00:15:01.840 - 00:15:43.782, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. It's definitely no easy problem to solve MEV, but also sort of like one of the whole benefits of app chains was that you get a lot more control over sort of MEV value capture customizability of MEV solutions. And that's something really big that skip protocol is working on within the sort of cosmos ecosystem. And so for Antonio to come out and basically say, know, like our MeV solution is, just don't do it. If not, we're going to stash you. It doesn't seem like the best solution. I'm not like a good trader by any means, but I don't know, what if there was like a validator that perhaps he's like a quote unquote dumb validator.
00:15:43.782 - 00:16:31.162, Speaker C: He doesn't know what he's doing. He uses a bad transaction ordering algorithm, and the algorithm flags him as extracting mev. Or for example, someone's providing someone else with a bad execution price because he knows that order flow is toxic for whatever reason. That also seems like a fair reason to mess up someone's execution by a slight amount. So yeah, it's definitely like a tricky problem. I'm definitely not qualified to solve it or talk about it in depth, but snatching seems like too simple of a solution. It feels like there should be some in protocol mechanism to sort of fight mev, or the ability for people to capture mev, rather than just say, don't do it at all.
00:16:31.216 - 00:17:01.214, Speaker B: Yeah, or even internalizing it somehow. If you created the MEV, yes, it makes a worse trading experience for users. But at the same time, if you can return that and distribute it as rebates to traders based on how much fees they paid or open interest or something along those lines, that feels a little bit better than just threatening the slash validators based on certain behavior that isn't actually a part of the protocol's rule set. So, yeah, I'm right there with you, Dan. Who you got in the hot seat or cool throne?
00:17:01.262 - 00:17:57.638, Speaker E: I got a cool throne this week, so I'm going to put Lido in the cool throne, which is probably due to put me in the hot seat at some point. But estaking overall has hit 20% of supply as staked, so no surprise there to really see that number continue its trend higher. And it's definitely showing zero signs of stopping. So right now, there's about 650,000 active validators and another 80,000 are sitting in the activation queue waiting to come online. Of course, that's a gradual process which is operated by the consensus mechanism. And so because of that, we're seeing another twelve and a half percent, basically, of the current validator set is literally just sitting there waiting to come online. So that number is continuing to go up only, and Lido is kind of dominating not only the original set of stake, but also the new flows of stake as they come online.
00:17:57.638 - 00:18:59.658, Speaker E: So right now they have about 75% specifically of the LST market share, and about 32% of all ETH staked is done through Lido. So of course there's some concerns around one entity controlling too much stake. The other side of the aisle there would tell you, okay, yes, there's 32% of all es staked with one entity, however, there's 29 or so validators that are actually managing that stake. So the actual risk is sharded amongst those entities. And they actually recently passed a governance prop unrelated to their stake breakdown, but a prop to kind of dog food their own LST and stake their 20,000 ETH in their treasury into staked EtH. So what's interesting there is, with the yield off of that staked and unstaked, or the now staked ETH, they can kind of confund their operations or just hold on to that extra yield and use it to increase their treasury. There's definitely some contentions around whether or not that's a great idea.
00:18:59.658 - 00:20:11.502, Speaker E: But overall, I think that we've seen a push for improved treasury management, and that alone is exciting to me. And so when you're looking out as to which protocols are exciting and going to continue to be exciting into the next cycle, that we also desperately hope to come, Lido is definitely on that list. They're potential for a cash machine, just given that right now they're doing about 600 million in fees with a 10% take rate, five of which goes to the Dow. So right now, their total fees is about 60 million, their total sales or revenue is about 60 million, and then to the Dow is about 30 million. So when you start kind of doing running some multiples on that, based on their current valuation, about 1.7 billion market cap and 2 billion FDV, the math doesn't really make a ton of sense at the current ETH price. Of course, since they have ethnominated cash flows as ETH improves, then so do their cash flows, which is this bit of an interesting dynamic of how do you value a protocol when they're trying to value things back in dollars when their cash flows aren't denominated in dollars? So it's a bit interesting there.
00:20:11.502 - 00:20:31.458, Speaker E: But sitting at about a 60 x price to dow revenue and about a 30 x price to total sales, that definitely doesn't make it sound cheap. But again, it's kind of primed to do. I don't want to say do well, and of course, none of this is not financial advice, but it's definitely sitting in a dominant position within its market sector.
00:20:31.554 - 00:21:34.774, Speaker C: Just a few points on sort of like the 32% of all safety. Obviously, that's creeping very close to the point, the 32.3% where if an attacker wanted to, they could prevent the chain from finalizing. But as Dan mentioned. Right, like Lido split between 20 different validators today, I don't think that's as much of a concern. I think one interesting thing that was highlighted earlier this year was that Lido ran a vote in their governance forums about whether they should self limit, and basically everyone voted no, whereas rocket pool conducted the same vote and basically everyone voted yes. I do think there's sort of like an ideological difference between the two, and it should be interesting to see at what point do people start worrying if lido becomes like 50% of staked deep? Do people start really, for lack of a better term, shitting themselves and asking for some in protocol balancing mechanism in order to balance out the, quote unquote, concentration between people that are staking?
00:21:34.822 - 00:22:21.846, Speaker E: One thing I want to say there is fracs came out and did the same thing, and they're like, hey, we're going to self limit. Sam Kay said that, of course, I don't think that ever made it to a governance vote, but it's a lot easier to say you're going to self limit when you don't have 33% of the stake, or quite frankly, a path to getting there in the near term. So I commend them for coming out and doing this. But at the end of the day, once you have that stake in hand, it's a bit different to kind of be like, yeah, we'll self limit. But I don't know, just an interesting thing to think about, because I don't think there's anything in the rocket pool code that says if greater than 32% of the assets, of the network's assets are in our possession, then a switch will automatically flip where new deposits aren't allowed.
00:22:21.878 - 00:22:59.622, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. There was talk, too, a while ago on the Lido forums to let, gosh, I'm going to botch this potentially. But it was somehow letting eth holders have governance rights over the lido. No, it was Steth holders, wasn't it? Over the LDO token holders decision? So that way it would hopefully align incentives better. But I don't really even know if that ever got any. I mean, I guess for the counterpoint, in terms of how bad is this, I would say lido rocket pool, any decentralized LST provider does do a lot for diversifying consensus and execution layer clients. So that's a big plus.
00:22:59.622 - 00:23:08.310, Speaker B: But obviously the more important part is probably going to end up being the actual stake weight. So I don't know, it's a bit of a tough nut to crack, honestly.
00:23:08.390 - 00:24:01.930, Speaker C: Want to go further and say, sort of like the market, eventually, in the long term, expresses its preferences. Right. And so if the market's preferences are a preference for liquidity, utility of staked, deep across multiple protocols, integration, ability to do like cool things with staked and lido, and they value that more than the decentralization of Ethereum, then that's just the market expressing its preferences. They're just saying that, okay, I don't care that much about decentralization relative to all of the other things that I could do with staked. And I feel like if you're staking, like, chances are you know what you're doing, you're securing the Ethereum network. You're not just looking at it and going, oh, okay, I get to get some yield. You have some semblance of what you're contributing to.
00:24:01.930 - 00:24:16.522, Speaker C: And so, yeah, that's what I view it as. It's just an expression of market preferences. And if it turns out that, I don't know Lido is like 70% of all sake, then so be it. That's just a market saying that it doesn't care that much about decentralization.
00:24:16.666 - 00:24:57.542, Speaker E: Yeah, that's an interesting viewpoint, Ren. And the other thing here is there's definitely some winner take all forces in the liquid staking kind of landscape, right. The idea of having an LST is to continue holding the underlying asset and get its benefits. So in this case, you're getting solid collateral, which is eth with the yield. And now I can go use that throughout DeFi or just as any other asset, or I can just hold it on my own and just accrue those rewards. So the idea of using it across other DeFi applications, there's definitely the risk of like, okay, well, now I'm holding an asset that's in a few more smart contracts. I want to use the safest asset.
00:24:57.542 - 00:25:53.758, Speaker E: And we generally perceive the safest asset as being the asset that has the bundle of cash behind it that has just been essentially sitting there as a bounty for black hats that want to go target that and exploit it. So there is like a time element where you get battle tested and hardened through time. And Lido has had billions of dollars in TVL for quite some time. Their withdrawals contracts were live, one of the first, not the first, but in the top tier of protocols to push those live. Of course, new contracts means new risks, and those are hardening as well. And so it's kind of hard for me to see a world where lido starts losing market share rapidly, even though you have rocket pool, which is putting a decentralized ethos first, and Coinbase, which is putting convenience first, and Frax, which is putting a yield maximizing solution first. We really haven't seen either of those other three things.
00:25:53.758 - 00:26:06.834, Speaker E: Kind of get the Lindy behind them, as Lido has, who, honestly, their biggest win was being the first LST integrated into AAvE. That's when you pull up their supply chart, and that was the apex moment.
00:26:06.872 - 00:26:39.980, Speaker C: For them, I think. One interesting black horse that I like to see how plays out is Eigen layer, especially when restaking goes live. For example, what if the second or third largest LSD protocol goes okay, sure, we're going to opt in for a few Eigen layer services. We're just going to do like our own due diligence. We're only going to restake for the super large oracle, the super large middleware. But because of that, we're going to provide an extra 4% on eve staking yield. And then maybe Lido will need to do something there.
00:26:39.980 - 00:27:14.374, Speaker C: Maybe everything flows out of lido, starts flowing to this other liquid staking protocol. I feel like that'll be an interesting thing to watch. And I would guess people will have to vote on that, right? If Lido wants to sort of opt in into Eigenve staking, there's going to be a very contentious governance vote around that, especially if we get to a state where there are relatively, quote unquote safe services that you can restake for, and they're providing a decent amount of sustainable yield over the e staking yield. I feel like that'd be a very interesting dynamic to watch play out.
00:27:14.412 - 00:27:52.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember Sriram, when we brought him on, the co founder of Eigen Lair was saying he was interested to see how the market would value a truly decentralized validator set. Because he was saying, like, maybe this application will only let people restake who run solo at home validators, or maybe this one wants to exclude steeth. So I'm excited to see how that plays out. Although I do tend to think that pretty much everyone by default is going to choose steep just for the sole purpose of what Dan said in terms of battle testing and network effects and liquidity. But I guess we can just kind of keep our fingers crossed and watch how it plays out. Dan, you want to tell people what's good with the atom accelerator?
00:27:52.110 - 00:27:52.766, Speaker E: Absolutely, Sam.
00:27:52.798 - 00:27:52.946, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:52.968 - 00:28:30.830, Speaker E: So shout out to the atom accelerator for sponsoring our show. Again, if you're a developer looking for something interesting to build and a way to start, kind of get Kickstarter, get that initial round of funding, the atom accelerator is definitely the way to go. The cosmos atom economic zone is getting more and more interesting as each day passes through. So definitely come to the atom economic zone to build. They have interchange security, which gives you the ability to launch a new consumer chain with the benefit of the cosmos hub security. They have IBC, which gives you the ability to have interop with every other chain. We have that out of the box native solution, which is becoming increasingly important across the industry.
00:28:30.830 - 00:29:16.794, Speaker E: Duality is kind of setting forth the standard of what those proposals should look like by bringing a new order book decks to the atom economic zone. Stride has really kind of pioneered what that looks like and continuing to push the advancement of lsts. And of course, Noble is bringing native USDC to the ecosystem. So they have a grants program running through the Atom accelerator that does rolling monthly grants in batches of $10,000 to $1 million. So again, if you are looking to kind of bring a development to the autumn economic zone, be sure to click the link in our description. And now onto the interview with Jeto Labs. All right, guys, we are joined today by Lucas Bruder, the co founder and CEO of Jeto Labs.
00:29:16.794 - 00:29:32.878, Speaker E: Lucas, thanks a ton for joining us. I think you picked two great areas, man. Sitting at the crossroads of MeV and liquid staking is probably the two most engaging cornerstones of Defi today. So can you just take a second to briefly walk us through what Jito is and what it offers to its users?
00:29:32.974 - 00:30:13.102, Speaker A: Yeah. First off, thanks for having me. You guys have been putting out great content recently. So excited to be on here. So Jito is high performance MeV software for the Solana blockchain that aims to help the network run at higher think. Most people listen this are probably familiar with meV, but for those that aren't, it's the value that can be extracted by block producers on network by reordering, inserting, removing transactions. And we basically aim to make that as efficient as possible.
00:30:13.236 - 00:30:40.378, Speaker E: Perfect. And so most of our more ethereum centric or ethereum focused listeners are maybe a bit confused at how MEV solutions can kind of be paired with like a liquid staking solution, just given how Ethereum is kind of gradually enshrining the MeV boost protocol into the base layer itself. So can you kind of walk us through Solana's design, since it's not really compatible with full block proposing and really what the Solana MeV supply chain looks like?
00:30:40.464 - 00:31:24.870, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's a few main differences between Salana and Ethereum MeV. So I guess the most obvious thing is that Salana is very fast. That's 400 millisecond block times. Every leader gets four consecutive slots, or multiples of four consecutive slots in a row, and they're kind of bouncing all over the world and every 1.6 seconds. So past that, the other main large difference is that block production on Salana is continuous.
00:31:24.870 - 00:32:24.242, Speaker A: So on Ethereum, I think the block times around 12 seconds. So you essentially have 12 seconds where the state is kind of paused and there's no transactions being processed. You kind of have this PBS system running where builders are submitting to relayers, and they're doing the simulation, and at the end of the 12 seconds they'll submit, the proposer will take the highest block. On Salana, the block production is continuous, so the slot starts and the validator starts to execute those transactions and send them out, basically, during the whole 400 millisecond slot time. So this makes what we're doing pretty difficult. There's not really a time where the state is paused. So it's kind of more similar to high frequency trading.
00:32:24.242 - 00:32:31.578, Speaker A: So where you are in the world, your latencies, how much time you're spending processing things, is very important.
00:32:31.744 - 00:32:41.086, Speaker E: And is that really the biggest challenge today is the fact that Solana effectively has this continuous block time, rather than these discrete intervals where transactions can effectively build up?
00:32:41.268 - 00:33:35.358, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's definitely one of the large challenges. I think the other thing is that the amount of mev spam on Solana is much more than what it is on reason. I guess that's the reason why my co founder and I started jeto, kind of saw what was going on with Polygon BSc and these other high throughput, low fee chains, where, you know, if your fee is a penny or 100th of a penny, basically, any arbitrage that creates a profit over that is going to be profitable. So you're seeing, like, tens to hundreds of failed arbitrages per block. And just like dealing, the latency is hard, and then also just the volume of transactions that are coming through that are arbitrage related is pretty hard as well.
00:33:35.444 - 00:33:44.574, Speaker B: And then you guys also have Jito Solana, which is like a custom client focused on extracting mev. So how does that work, and what percentage of the network is actually running that client?
00:33:44.622 - 00:34:52.220, Speaker A: So, yeah, Jito Solana, it's very similar to Mevgeth, which know Flashpot's kind of first iteration of more efficient mev extraction. It's a custom client, similar to how Mevgeth was based on Geth Judo. Solana is based on the Solana labs about air client, and there's a few things that it does in there. The main thing is it knows how to process bundles, so it knows how to execute bundles sequentially and handle all the locking and threading, knows how to handle the mev tips. And there's also some functionality in there that will basically enable our systems to get access to state faster so that we can update our simulators and kind of predict and know what's happening as fast as possible. And that just means that the system will be more efficient and extract more mev. The amount of stake that's running it today is, I think it's around.
00:34:52.220 - 00:35:02.886, Speaker A: It's just over 100 million Sol, which is currently at roughly just over 27 or 28% of all stake on the network.
00:35:02.998 - 00:35:10.638, Speaker B: Interesting. Okay. And then with fire dancer coming along, does that change things at all? Is that like an upgrade that you guys are going to need to undergo, or what does that look like?
00:35:10.724 - 00:35:42.186, Speaker A: Yeah, so, yeah, there will be a judo dancer. I think they're making very good progress on fire dancer. We're keeping a close eye on how things are going. I've heard. I think Anatolia on Twitter said the other day that they're trying to get it running on testnet. It's unclear if it's the full fire dancer or this, like, franken dancer, where it's kind of a mishmash of Solana labs and fire dancer by the end of the year. But as that develops, we're keeping close eye on it.
00:35:42.186 - 00:36:34.106, Speaker A: It will definitely be very different. I've kind of taken a look through their code. It's very dense, it's all written in c, and they care a lot about their performance. There will be another fun learning curve that our team is looking forward to diving into. Kind of like learning how that code base works, they're basically rewriting everything from scratch. So there would be another learning experience there. How do we kind of plug into know when? I don't know how long it's going to take for the network or Solana stakers to increase the throughput of the network, but that will probably have a big impact on how the MEV is performed on our system.
00:36:34.106 - 00:36:38.140, Speaker A: So that's kind of something that we're starting to think about as well.
00:36:39.870 - 00:37:30.618, Speaker E: Okay, very interesting. Yeah, that was a great point because last time we talked to Anatoly, like, fired answer really does seem like a pretty big scalability or just performance improvement to these entire Solana network. So excited to kind of see that one play in as. So when you think talking back to the Jito Solana client, then. So this effectively, the unlock, to me, sounds like the ability to read and process bundles. And so I'm imagining that just like in ethereum, you'd have searchers who create bundles and pass those along through the network. Is that kind of the exact same process with the Solana Jito client? And how do transactions ultimately get included? Because if we have validators processing four blocks at a time, I would imagine it would only be validators that are running the GdO Salana client that can actually push through those MEV transactions.
00:37:30.714 - 00:38:28.718, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you asked about the transaction supply chain earlier. So I guess diving into that for like 32nd TLDR, essentially, there's no mempool in Salana. So when you send a transaction through your wallet, it'll get forwarded to an RPC server. At this point, ethereum would kind of like, gossip it out or send it to builders or there's a few different things going on there on Solana, it'll send it straight to the leader and the next, like one or two leaders, and it will attempt to get processed there. And there's kind of some forwarding and retry logic that goes on with Jeto Solana. There's this addition of a relayer. It's a little different than the flashbots relayer, but essentially a validator tells RPC servers to send transactions there, and then they get forwarded to the block engine.
00:38:28.718 - 00:39:32.942, Speaker A: Searchers can kind of see what's going on or what's about to happen, and then they can submit bundles to the block engine, and the block engine will attempt to simulate them and resimulate them when necessary to basically predict what the tip is going to be. And then every 200 milliseconds, we kind of like, discretize the time. So basically we run an auction every 200 milliseconds that's tunable, and at 200 milliseconds, we'll basically take the highest paying bundles and forward those to the judo Salana validators. And yeah, you kind of mentioned this earlier, but the bundles only work with judo Salana clients. So searchers right now need to manage kind of two code paths for sending transactions. The normal they, because there's no mempool, they are basically reacting to state that has already been. They're reacting to transactions that have already been executed.
00:39:32.942 - 00:40:02.106, Speaker A: And with our system, they can kind of simulate, we added simulation endpoints for simulating bundles so they can simulate what's going to happen. Basically, they'll take a transaction, a user's trade, simulate it, figure out if that trade will create an arbitrage opportunity, and then they can send a bundle to us with that user's trade and then their trade immediately after that, and we'll take the highest payer.
00:40:02.138 - 00:40:02.574, Speaker E: Right on.
00:40:02.612 - 00:40:02.862, Speaker C: Okay.
00:40:02.916 - 00:40:14.580, Speaker E: And so then there's ultimately a tip that goes from the searcher to the validator, and that's what gets passed on to the liquid staking solution, is that.
00:40:15.190 - 00:41:04.190, Speaker A: Will get the tip will get passed on to any staker on that validator. So on Solana, you can have multiple, like, multiple stake pools, will stake to the same validator, and then you'll have a bunch of people that aren't in stake pools staking to those validators too. And so those tips go to anyone that's staking on the validator. So jeto Sol think it stakes to, like, 38 validators right now that run jeto Salana. So those 38 stake accounts will get the MeV. And then basically Jeta soul is like a reward bearing token. So the amount of Sol backing one jeto soul will increase over time.
00:41:04.190 - 00:41:04.494, Speaker A: Okay.
00:41:04.532 - 00:41:23.170, Speaker E: Right. Yeah. So it's got like that wrap stake death model where the exchange rate is what's increasing over time to accrue those fees. And so you mentioned the 38 validators that you have running the about 850,000 sole stake right now. How do these validators get chosen? And then how is just stake equally distributed across those validators?
00:41:23.250 - 00:42:02.290, Speaker A: Yeah, so the minimum requirement is to run the Judah Solana client. And the performance there is the same or even better than the normal client. And so the rewards there are naturally pretty high. There's a lot of high quality operators running it. I think there's like 145 validators running judo Salana right now. And so that's kind of running judo Salana is the minimum requirement. And then past that, it's basically a process of looking at how well the validator performs.
00:42:02.290 - 00:42:15.426, Speaker A: And it's pretty hand wavy right now, but there's work being done to make that more automated and transparent.
00:42:15.538 - 00:42:33.520, Speaker B: That's super interesting, because Lido obviously only has 29 node operators, and you're already up to 38 with obviously much less network penetration. No, sorry. So they're running 29 on Ethereum, 29 node operators amongst all the stake. But it sounds like you have, like, were you saying you have 145?
00:42:35.170 - 00:42:44.400, Speaker A: There's 145 running jeto Salana client, and then Jeto Sol, the stake pool stakes to 38 of those.
00:42:45.170 - 00:42:51.300, Speaker B: Okay, got you. So are you trying to expand that validator set as much as you can, or how does that look?
00:42:51.670 - 00:43:13.222, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the benefits of liquid staking is kind of distributing. There's no slashing on Salana, but basically distributing the downtime risk across a lot of validators that are high then. So we're always looking to expand that to high performing validators.
00:43:13.286 - 00:43:21.518, Speaker E: How do you think about geographic location when it comes to validator selection? Just given the low latency requirements, I'd imagine colocation must be pretty big here.
00:43:21.604 - 00:44:41.400, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the decentralization is super important. I think we kind of saw what happened with flashbots in the OFAC thing, where you have a lot of validators and block builders that were us based, and they were essentially not touching tornado, that they did get included eventually for people that were outside of the US and don't necessarily answer to the. But you know, I think that was a good showing of why it's important to decentralize your validator set. And the stake pool is looking to maximize the kind of geopolitical decentralization. So trying to hit multiple countries and make sure that stake is distributed pretty decentralized or spread out across multiple countries. The block engine is kind of the same. We have Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Tokyo, New York, and we'll probably be spinning up more pretty soon.
00:44:41.400 - 00:45:21.874, Speaker A: I think that meb can potentially be used as like a carrot to kind of get people to decentralize of if you set up something, there's a lot of stake in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, but if you set up something in Paris or South America or something, then there are validators that care a lot about decentralization, and they will actually move to that block then.
00:45:22.072 - 00:45:28.118, Speaker E: I've heard this mentioned a few times around the concentration of stake in Frank. What's the reasoning behind that?
00:45:28.204 - 00:46:13.330, Speaker A: For a long time, there's a lot of stake on Hetzner, and Hetzner like a data center server, very cheap fees, and running a validator is pretty expensive. Salana gets a lot of feedback, or I guess you could just call it hate for that. Or it's like, oh, it's too expensive to run it. We pay anywhere from $800 to $1,000 a month per validator. Hetsner is like 175. So that's like saving a few thousand dollars per year. So I think that was kind of the original reason.
00:46:13.330 - 00:46:23.106, Speaker A: I think Hetsner blacklisted the ports that Salana uses, brought down testnet, and people were like, oh, shit, this is like pretty serious.
00:46:23.218 - 00:47:00.100, Speaker E: So jumping over to Jito Sol, the liquid staking token itself, pulling up Solana compass, we really see that it performs quite well. So Jito is actually the third largest staking pool with coming behind Marinade and Lido. So Marinade's got an average yield of around six and a half percent, Lido 5.8, and Jito up to 7.2. So assuming that most of this yield is driven by exactly what we've been talking about, is that mev extraction, are we seeing a large amount of mev be extracted on a daily basis? And kind of what is that trend looking like?
00:47:00.630 - 00:47:44.282, Speaker A: Yeah, so the MEV that's being extracted by the judo labs block engine is still pretty small relative to all MeV. There's a lot of engineering improvements that need to be made to make it extract more, but you'll start to see that kind of rolled out within probably like the next month or so. There's going to be a big change in the way that the bundles are selected, so I think that will be able to hit way more. I think most of the yield comes from choosing high quality validators that really know what they're doing and really care about Solana and the performance of their validator.
00:47:44.426 - 00:48:23.070, Speaker E: And so I'm also curious, because you mentioned that a, there's kind of being some MeV left on the table, but I'm more curious about almost from the network as a whole. So it's notoriously hard to get data around this, but it does seem like a majority of Ethereum MEV is related to just Dex activity, whether it be sex to Dex, Arb, or sandwich attacks. That does seem to be like a core piece of what drives MEV value for Ethereum. And given that Solana kind of has a fraction of the Dex volume, do you think there'll be a different way where Solana sees a ton of mev coming from something else, or how do you kind of view that dynamic playing?
00:48:24.290 - 00:50:09.338, Speaker A: I mean, I think there's a lot of similar factors at play to Ethereum, that when you see a lot of volume and people trading and also speculation, like what we saw with Pepe and some of the other shitcoins, there's a lot of arbitrage and Mev that happens because of that. And we're seeing the same on Solana when Bonk was kind of the thing to trade for. I think it's the beginning of this year, there was a ton of Mev, and we still see that occasionally where someone will sell some low liquidity coin and generate like a few thousand dollars arbitrage for a searcher. So I think the MEV is like, roughly the amount of volume somewhat influences the amount of MEV, but I think the thing that Solana has going forward is that there will probably be less MeV than Ethereum just because there's so many more efficient, like, pieces. And the defi infrastructure on Solana is so efficient. So you're seeing the clmms, like radium and orca serum openbook, and then like Phoenix, the central limit order book, and those just generally expose less mev than you see on amms. So I think that there's always going to be Mev, but I think that the users on Solana are going to be better off than Ethereum when it comes to Mev.
00:50:09.434 - 00:50:17.490, Speaker B: Interesting. Now, when we talked with Anatoli, like, I don't know, a couple months ago, he was talking a lot about isolated fee markets. Does that have any impact on Mev?
00:50:17.830 - 00:51:36.250, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So I think what we see is that on Ethereum, there's kind of just like one. I'm oversimplifying it a lot, but there's basically, like one resource, it's just block space, and there's not really any separate notion of state or anything. So if you have all these people that are speculating on Pepe, or you have these arbitrage bots that are doing trades, they're taking up block space from NFT mints and transfers, and there's not really a way to separate the fees for those things where on Solana, with these isolated fee markets, basically, the idea is that every account, I guess, every transaction will bid on a set of state, and your access to that state will be based on what you're bidding relative to others bidding on the same state. So in the case of, like, you can have arbitragers, like, tipping like half a soul, or I guess, using priority fees. And that shouldn't impact the price or the, shouldn't impact the price or the amount that people pay for an NFT mint. I think that's kind of the dream.
00:51:36.250 - 00:51:55.182, Speaker A: In reality, there's some work that needs to be done on the scheduler inside the validator. That's kind of like figuring out how to pack this block. But I think that the Solana labs and some of the engineers that are spending a lot of time on that, so expect to see that improve a lot.
00:51:55.236 - 00:51:58.194, Speaker E: So, yeah, I guess one question I have spawning off of that is really.
00:51:58.232 - 00:51:58.820, Speaker A: Just.
00:52:00.630 - 00:52:24.950, Speaker E: I guess, what percentage? Hard question to answer, but what percentage of transactions do you think can actually be processed in isolation and don't actually overlap state? Of course, when there's, like a super hot NFT mint that can kind of be, like, bucketed onto its own thread. But in the case of everyday activity, is it fair to think that a lot of these transactions can actually be processed in isolation?
00:52:25.110 - 00:53:03.794, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. When you have a lot of an order book or a market is always going to be single threaded. As far as I know, there's like no way to multithread it. So you're always going to have some contention there. But oftentimes when you have volatility, you have a lot of markets moving together, and every one of those markets is separate, assuming that the program architected it well, and there's no overlap of accounts. So I think the Orca, like Sol USDC, is separate from orca judo. Soul.
00:53:03.794 - 00:53:44.722, Speaker A: Soul. So those can kind of be traded in parallel. As far as like, I think Salana is kind of aiming to be this ultimate lo one where you have all this activity taking place. There's not going to be like l two s, or bridges or anything. So if you have a lot of activity going on on those things, then all those in arbitrage should happen the same time in parallel as like a game or notification or liquidation or NFT mint. So I think there are a lot of things that can happen in parallel. It's actually something I've been wanting to look into.
00:53:44.722 - 00:53:54.450, Speaker A: I just don't have the time looking at the data and seeing how parallel is it actually? In theory, it should be very parallel.
00:53:54.530 - 00:54:02.842, Speaker B: Getting back to the liquid staking token discussion. So, jito soul, is there a take rate that you guys have, or what does that look like?
00:54:02.976 - 00:54:05.066, Speaker A: What do you mean take rate in.
00:54:05.088 - 00:54:13.630, Speaker B: Terms of the percentage of rewards? Does some go to jeto, some goes to the validator operators, et cetera?
00:54:14.050 - 00:54:35.998, Speaker A: Yeah, so the stake pool operator will take 4% fee on that right now. So that's the current fee for the stake pool, and that's collected every epoch, which it's 4% of the inflation mev going to the stake pool operator.
00:54:36.174 - 00:54:45.782, Speaker B: And as a tokenist protocol, would you say there's a path towards value accrual in the future that you're looking to embark on, or how do you think about value accrual for Jito in general?
00:54:45.916 - 00:55:36.230, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a few ways to do that. I think liquid staking tokens get their utility from having a lot of integrations and being used across a lot of dexes having deep liquidity. I think that there's like, obviously, there's like a little smart contract risk. The geosol stake pool has been audited, I think, like four to five times. So past that, liquid staking, in my opinion, is purely superior than just the normal staking. I think the fees will go to the treasury and the treasury will kind of decide what to do with the fees.
00:55:36.570 - 00:55:52.218, Speaker E: Right. And so when we think about the liquid staking landscape for today, we have marinade, lido and jito kind of like leading this pack. What do you think really separates from. From getting adopted and becoming the number one liquid staking provider?
00:55:52.314 - 00:57:46.194, Speaker A: So I think that having the best delegation strategy for where stake is deployed, not only from a client standpoint, but also location standpoint, I think that's kind of like an underexplored area. And something that you can kind of expect to see more of in the future is like, how do these protocols determine who gets stake and who doesn't? Who has the opportunity to kind of keep these protocols running? And I think something else is like, there aren't really super decentralized liquid staking systems on Solana. I think maybe you could consider Lido like super decentralized, but there's still kind of this centralization component of it and basically decentralizing the complete. I think there's a lot of value in decentralizing the complete operation of the pool. And how do you do that trustlessly? So I think there's a lot to do there and then a lot of liquidity. How do you figure out where the liquidity goes? Do you want to incentivize, like, jeto Sol USDC pairs, or can you just rely on, like, sole USDC pairs? And there's one more thing I wanted to mention. Oh, yeah.
00:57:46.194 - 00:58:28.046, Speaker A: Also, I think that when you start to automate these services, they kind of look like other validator sets as well. So when you have these people that are cranking stuff and keeping things running off chain and they start to kind of look like validator sets. So how do you incentivize people to participate in those and things like that? So those are kind of some of the things that we're thinking about. The design space is very large. It's a hard problem to figure out what to focus on.
00:58:28.228 - 00:58:43.300, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And then, if I'm not mistaken, the LST market on Solana in terms of percentage of supply staked is a lot lower than that, that you see in a lot of other proof of stake ecosystems. So do you have a thesis as to why that is the way it is?
00:58:44.550 - 00:59:26.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of structural reasons why that is compared to Ethereum. So Ethereum didn't have withdrawals until this year where Solana basically had withdrawals from day one. There's not really a withdrawal or activation queue on Solana. It's like two days. So you can actually get out of your staked positions pretty easily. And then I think the defi ecosystem on Solana is like a little less mature than Ethereum is. So I think that's kind of why it's so successful on Ethereum compared to Solana.
00:59:26.270 - 01:00:32.150, Speaker A: I think that there hasn't really been like a team or messaging that has really nailed it on Solana. So it'll be interesting to kind of see what messaging resonates with people and what kind of narrative, what kind of messaging. How do you kind of strike a chord with people? Because I think the market on Solana is a little different. There's a heavy NFT community on Solana. So how do you kind of figure out what they want and message liquid staking to them? I think that also, as we're seeing with marginfi, their points and cipher points, there's kind of this resurgence of defi activity. And I think that liquid staking is kind of one of the most, if not the most important assets for Defi. So you can stake Sol into a liquid staking token like Judah soul, get like 6% or 7% and then go use that in Defi.
01:00:32.150 - 01:00:40.940, Speaker A: And until now, there's been some decent Defi options. But I think we're starting to see that stuff really pick up now.
01:00:42.270 - 01:01:08.274, Speaker E: Yeah, that's interesting. You flagged the margin five points system that they're running right now. I was actually looking at that the other day, and interestingly, I noticed that Jeto Soul is actually the most deposited liquid staking token. So although marinade and vido have larger solutions at the moment, their token holders seem a little more dormant and a little less active than some of the jeto holders, which is a pretty interesting concept, I think.
01:01:08.312 - 01:01:48.670, Speaker A: I think over 10% of the circulating jeto soul is deposited in margin phi in the growth of jeto soul. I think over the last week, I think it's grown 32%. That's in like sole terms, not including the price of Seoul. I think it's up. Seoul's been on a tear. Yeah. I mean, it just kind of shows you there's capital that's waiting to be deployed on Solana and people are waiting for the right teams and the right opportunity.
01:01:48.670 - 01:02:04.210, Speaker A: And I think a lot of people obviously speculating on airdrops as well, which we've seen in the past has been pretty lucrative, but also can drive a lot of activity to protocols?
01:02:05.190 - 01:02:38.810, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And I just do wonder, I assume you've been around for a little bit and you kind of experienced all the FTX stuff of last year. Obviously, the people using your protocol, they're here for Solana. They've been around the block like they're actual loyal supporters. And I think that could probably explain some of the margin fi activity with seeing that as the largest deposited asset. But what has the vibe been over in Solana since the implosion? Like, I'm just curious to get your take on the matter on the ground.
01:02:38.890 - 01:03:51.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's been really rough, I think, not only like, internally and seeing a lot of liquidity dry up and kind of, there are some people that will claim that they called it and they saw that SPF was evil from the beginning, but I think most people can't say that. And you kind of had this entity or this person that was kind of like a good spokesperson for Solana, and they turned out to be a total scam. And it's kind of like scam by association. I think that's kind of the way that I'll just call them eth Maxis interpreted it, where it's like, oh, Salana is a scam. But there's a lot of teams that are super dedicated to building on Salana. They believe in this ultimate l, one that tries to be as efficient as possible with the hardware and these computers. And so while I was super rough for a while and kind of like from the plane home, from breakpoint last year to maybe January to even middle of this year, I think that was a little rough.
01:03:51.954 - 01:04:49.740, Speaker A: But I think there's a lot of people that kind of stuck around, and there's a lot of camaraderie that's forming between these teams and that are really trying to basically rebuild from what was left. So I think we're seeing, especially in the last two or three weeks or even month, there's kind of just been like this slow grind where you're seeing more and more people talk about Solana starting to gain more mind share. But I think the last two or three weeks has just been insane. There's just been good TvL growth, good price action, a lot of people talking about Twitter. We have a slack bot that sends a message every time one of the jido labs or jido sold twitters is tagged. And it's just like blowing up nonstop. So it's like things are starting to look up again.
01:04:49.740 - 01:05:16.638, Speaker A: And then I think there's a lot of people that are excited about fire dancer as well. So I think things were pretty rough for a while, but I think they're definitely getting better. And I think there's a lot of teams that are taking ownership, and it's like, this is like our time to shine. This is our time to rebuild. No one's going to do it for us. We just have to take it into our own hands and do it. And that's definitely, like, the attitude we're taking.
01:05:16.724 - 01:05:37.830, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I love to hear that. It does feel like we kind of turn the corner a little bit. I mean, cross our fingers every time I say that, I feel something. I'm curious, what primitives do you think are missing from Solana Defi in order to enable LSTs to flourish, or maybe even just Solana defi more broadly?
01:05:38.830 - 01:07:10.178, Speaker A: Yeah, I think kind of like some curve like exchanges, I think would help a lot. I think that safety above all else, there's a lot of people that got burned between centralized exchanges and, like, hacks and safe protocols. I think super important. It's kind of an obvious, though. I think there's a lot of interesting things on automation and things that are only possible on, like, I think, like, lifinity is pretty cool, Camino, where you kind of have these protocols that are using automation to manage defi positions, and you can just adjust the positions so frequently that I think more things like that are needed on Solana. I think the main thing for lsts is the market is so small right now, it's like less than 2% of all soul that's staked is in liquid staking. So figuring out a way to, there's got to be a messaging to figure out ways to get normal stakers into liquid staking, in like, a liquid staking system that's safe.
01:07:10.274 - 01:07:54.654, Speaker E: Need more curve like exchanges on Solana. I couldn't agree more there. But one of the things, one core difference between ETH the asset, and sol the asset is exactly what you've been mentioning is like, this messaging and the narrative around, like, ETH is hard money. It's deflationary, it's programmatically deflationary, and it's got that whole movement behind it of ultrasound money, as it's oft called. But that is a very different, and almost, it's intentional. It's intentionally a different route than Solana has been taking, and they're not emphasizing it as money. But where I think that gets interesting for Lsts is because lsts are effectively yield bearing collateral, just a better form of the underlying asset.
01:07:54.654 - 01:08:09.370, Speaker E: And that's why I think they've seen so much popularity on ETH because ETH itself was already the most common collateral type, and now you have, like, a yield bearing version of that. But if Salana is not money, why do lsds still remain interesting collateral types?
01:08:11.630 - 01:08:51.302, Speaker A: If you're staking, then you're getting, like, roughly 7%, but you can't earn any yield in DFI. So I think that when you stake and you get a liquid version of it, you can actually go and put it into, like, a sol or solemn soul pair and earn additional yield on that through some curve, like decks or something. So I think that it's just like an extra source of yield and better than normal staking. Yeah.
01:08:51.356 - 01:09:10.970, Speaker B: Something I thought was cool was just know. You've mentioned how Solana is really known for the NFT community. I thought that partnership between, I think it was mad lads and a perps exchange on, like, I would love to see more of that. I feel like that's like a fantastic way to try and rope in the average user on Solana into a more defi ecosystem.
01:09:11.950 - 01:10:04.060, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. What Armani and Tristan have done with gathering attention around backpack and mad lads has been incredible. And I think that especially tensor, too, there's a lot of people excited about tensor and magic. Eden and I would like to see more liquid staking integration with those. Know, if you have an order resting or if you're putting in bids, why can't it just be in some liquid staked asset so at least you're earning yield, or if you have, like, a wallet on there, then put into liquid staking. But, yeah, I think they have a lot of things that they're working on, so you can ask, but everyone's so busy trying to scale and prepare for what's coming.
01:10:04.060 - 01:10:12.574, Speaker A: So looking to see more liquid staking integrations in the NFT space soon, for.
01:10:12.612 - 01:10:21.650, Speaker B: Sure, and then zooming out just a little bit. I did kind of want to get your higher level thesis, just why is Solana the best way to scale for blockchains?
01:10:23.030 - 01:11:18.114, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that if we're going to talk about the best way, I think it's interesting to look at the way others are scaling. So I think cosmos, you kind of have this app chain thesis, where every app is a chain. I think there's a lot of ux open questions there, like hopping through bridges and transferring from one chain to the other, that I think my parents aren't going to know how to do that. Even I have issues with that. Sometime between Ethan and l two or Ethereum and Salana. I think the same thing exists with l two s as well, the l two space. I haven't explored it a ton, but there's a lot of bridging, and I think it's just hard to reason about.
01:11:18.114 - 01:11:54.626, Speaker A: And I think there's a lot of. Everyone's like, oh, someday it'll just be abstracted from you and no one will know. And I just don't see that happening for a while. I think everyone's too busy building l two s. How many l two s are there now? Like 10, 20, 30? Is all this liquidity going to be fragmented between all these? How do I bridge between these? So I think that Salana is. There's certainly sacrificing some decentralization. I think, at least in the current state, you can't really run.
01:11:54.626 - 01:13:12.940, Speaker A: I could probably run a validator from home, but the average person can't. And so I think that is okay in my mind, and I would rather have this l one that's just super composable, super easy to use as someone that studied computer engineering in college, just like, super fascinated with computers. And there's a lot of chains that are kind of, like, ignoring the most efficient way to do computation and move data around between servers. And so I think that is super interesting and I think super underexplored in the mean. We're kind of seeing some of this happen with what Georgia said paradigm is working on with Reth, where it's just, like, way faster than any other. It's looking like it's going to be way faster than any other system. And just like, I think the way that Solana is focusing on that and making that their core priority and just kind of like leveraging cores that you can get through bare metal providers or Amazon or Google, it just makes sense to me.
01:13:12.940 - 01:13:41.940, Speaker A: There's definitely a lot of work to get toward. There's definitely a lot of work that needs to be done on the Solana protocol. And I think that we'll see fired answer and the jump team and then Solana labs and our team to contribute towards that. But I think there's a lot of engineering complexity, but I think system complexity is much simpler than all these l two s and things.
01:13:45.270 - 01:14:09.014, Speaker B: Yeah, it's honestly tough to argue with that thesis. And then, especially if you go over to Salana, the user experience is incredibly smooth. I will 100% give you guys that. It's so seamless. Phantom is by far, in my opinion, the best wallet, as well as Xnft backpack. That's super cool. I definitely admire the fact that you guys are trying to go for the consumer.
01:14:09.014 - 01:14:09.820, Speaker B: You know, what.
01:14:12.590 - 01:14:53.500, Speaker A: Kind of. It was a contrary intake for a while, but I think every day it gets more and more likely. I think anytime someone uses Salana, like I use Salana myself, I'm like, holy. It's like so fast. You go back to Ethereum, it's like you pay like $10 or $20, and I guess the fastest confirmation you could get is like 12 seconds, essentially. So when you use Salana and it's just like a traditional centralized server where you click a button and it's like, okay, your transaction has been processed. There's something magical about that.
01:14:53.500 - 01:15:01.946, Speaker A: I like Solana, like the experience, like, the teams working on it, super excited about the future.
01:15:02.048 - 01:15:06.510, Speaker E: And speaking of Xnft backback, you guys actually just did an integration with them, is that right?
01:15:06.580 - 01:15:17.042, Speaker A: Yeah, there's the Jeta soul staking application. So you can actually go in there and stake, deposit soul, and mint Jeta soul through there.
01:15:17.096 - 01:15:27.522, Speaker E: Yeah. I really like the idea of just using your wallet as more of the app interface. I think that's definitely pushing in the right direction. Again, being consumer focused.
01:15:27.586 - 01:15:48.300, Speaker A: Yeah. I think we need to explore xfts more. I think everyone does. I think Armani is kind of like showing us the way and bringing us to the light. And I think there's a lot of unexplored stuff that you can do with nfts that I would love to explore more.
01:15:51.310 - 01:16:05.300, Speaker B: Right on, man. Well, this has been a fantastic conversation. I appreciate you being so generous with your time, but I want to kick it over to you and just kind of give yourself the chance to give the listeners a shout to where they can find you on Twitter. Learn more about.
01:16:07.030 - 01:16:26.338, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So my Twitter is Buffalo. There's Jito underscore Labs Twitter, and you can learn more about what Jeto Labs is doing at WTF. And then if you want to stick Jeto Soul, you can navigate to Jeto network.
01:16:26.434 - 01:16:32.534, Speaker E: Awesome. Thanks a ton, Lucas. And real quick, where's the best place to find jetofocused analytics?
01:16:32.582 - 01:17:05.462, Speaker A: So, yeah, there's a website that we built called the Jeeto Explorer. It's explorer Jeto WTF. You can view all mev data that's happening on Solana. There you can view arbitrages. You can also take a look at the bundles that people are submitting through the block engine, see who's tipping the most, what's included in the transactions, and if you have any requests or feature requests or data you want to see. Stop by our discord and feel free to ask. Ask there.
01:17:05.516 - 01:17:11.974, Speaker E: That's awesome. Thanks a ton, Lucas. And we'll be sure to include all those links in the show notes as well. So thanks a ton, Lucas. And it was great speaking with.
