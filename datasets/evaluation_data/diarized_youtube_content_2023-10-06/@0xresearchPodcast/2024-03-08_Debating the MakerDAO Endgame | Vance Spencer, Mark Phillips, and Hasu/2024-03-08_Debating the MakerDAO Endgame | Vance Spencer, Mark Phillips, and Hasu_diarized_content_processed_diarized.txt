00:00:00.170 - 00:00:26.520, Speaker A: Like, what's the demand to hold Dai? And fundamentally, it comes kind of from the differentiation to other stablecoins, right? So when I borrow in DeFi or anywhere in crypto, I always borrow from Maker because it's the most tax efficient, has the best rates, period. Why is USDC growing? Why is USDT growing? But why is Dai really flat for a long time? And I think the yield itself cannot just be the answer.

00:01:27.506 - 00:01:44.720, Speaker D: So today we're going to be talking about Makerdao. Steakhouse put together an incredible report 50 pages long. Hopefully we can link to it in the show notes for people to read it. But Mark, do you maybe want to kick us off and explain just kind of how Maker Dow works at a high level so the listeners have an idea on that?
00:01:45.410 - 00:03:03.266, Speaker E: Yeah, so Maker is a two token system, and with MKR being the governance token and die being the stablecoin, it was one of the first stablecoins that kind of came on the market, and that's what really caught my attention. I got into crypto in kind of like mid 2013 when I saw bitcoin on CNBC, and it was just ripping from like double digits to triple digits that time, which was an astronomical move for someone that had only kind of seen equity like returns. And I found the white paper and became super interested in bitcoin and crypto fell a little out of love with it during the hard fork wars with bitcoin cash and the big block debates. But then later in 2017, became much more interested in crypto again with discovering about Ethereum. And that kind of bitcoin journey led me to maker Dow, where I always knew that a stable coin would be super important in this ecosystem. Just seeing how volatile bitcoin was, and the common criticism of it was that no one would use it if it was unstable, especially if it's appreciating constantly. You don't want to spend a currency that's appreciating constantly against your native currency.
00:03:03.266 - 00:03:14.330, Speaker E: So maker was one of the few ways to get exposure to that stablecoin thesis. The time, and thus kind of began my journey with maker.
00:03:14.990 - 00:03:31.040, Speaker D: Do you maybe want to go into how it works at a high level just because there's a lot of new people maybe coming into the market who don't fully understand? And Maker has kind of evolved pretty drastically since the beginning. So maybe dai issuance, peg stability, ensuring protocol solvency, those kind of things?
00:03:31.730 - 00:04:03.580, Speaker E: Yes. So Dai is an over collateralized stable coin. You basically lock up crypto native collateral, at least you did in the first version, and you mint Dai the stablecoin against it. The over collateralization ratios depend on the collateral. The more liquid and stable particular collateral is like eth Se. Generally you have lower collateralization ratios and maker charges a stability fee, which is often compared to an interest rate for that. And that's kind of how it accrues value.
00:04:03.580 - 00:05:15.950, Speaker E: A lot of the stability fees go to creating a surplus buffer or kind of like a bad debt reserve. So in the event of downward market volatility, when vaults are liquidated, the DAI users are protected because there's cushion to basically absorb that bad debt. Maker started with just ETH as collateral, and it was single collateral die, then evolved to multiclateral die, where it could basically use any ERC 20 as collateral. So that basically led to wrap bitcoin being onward as collateral, and a whole slew of other altcoins and different types of tokens, including the PDV tube, LP tokens, which are pretty much gone at this stage of the game. But back then, it was kind of thought that you could onboard any type of collateral to maker at the EOSC 20 standard. But the reality was the markets kind of pumped, especially ETH, and gas costs explode. The oracle costs became super high relative to the total liquidity of some of these altcoin assets.
00:05:15.950 - 00:05:29.350, Speaker E: So now makers kind of shifted back into these blue chip collaterals like ETH, steeth and wrap, bitcoin. And also a big theme in 2023 especially, was getting into the real world asset game more heavily.
00:05:29.850 - 00:06:00.250, Speaker F: Yeah, maybe. On the topic of real world assets, I would be interested to hear everybody's opinion on kind of changing the collateral type to a more illiquid version, because, of course, it's easier to sell eth than it is to sell like this off chain bonds. Do you guys think that there could be any liquidity troubles there at some point? And yeah. What's your opinions on maker going more into this rwas?
00:06:00.410 - 00:06:59.714, Speaker G: Yeah, I think a good corollary of this was steeth back in the day, probably like a year ago, and I think people were worried pretty much across the board that there wasn't enough liquidity in the curve pools to absorb any sort of liquidation style cascade of that collateral. And that just frankly wasn't true. Ditto USDC when it de pegged. And I think what we've learned is that there's always kind of a market for various collateral types, as long as they're not whitelisted in terms of only specific people can bid them when things turn south. And so I'm not particularly worried about them getting into collateral types, especially on the fixed income side, that could get them into trouble. I think there's basically infinite scale and infinite people who would bid that on chain. And even the larger firms, the larger market makers, would allocate significant portions of their balance sheet to something like that if it were to happen.
00:06:59.714 - 00:07:37.166, Speaker G: The thing that I'm kind of most interested in is liquid restaking tokens. LRTs are going to become very zeitgeisty in terms of collateral that people want to have accepted. When you can yield, like theoretically at least 30 or 40%, and you can borrow at seven, that's just going to be this natural carry trade that people put on. And I think the LRts are kind of like this other bucket of. It's kind of hard to tell how much risk they are. It's kind of hard to tell what the slashing conditions are. And it could get squirrely if there is this kind of cascading slashing moment.
00:07:37.166 - 00:07:49.650, Speaker G: And so that's kind of more of what worries me over. The medium term is not like the t bills. Those are totally fine in my mind, but kind of the other side of the crypto native spectrum.
00:07:51.510 - 00:08:51.746, Speaker A: Yeah. So the solvency, like managing and the solvency and liquidity for maker is one side of the coin to your question. Right, Brick? But the other is, what choice does maker have? Because when you look at stable coins, then they are fundamentally constrained in two ways. They are constrained on the demand side by the interest of people to hold the coin, and on the supply side of the willingness of the people to borrow the coin into existence. And so this is a fundamental concept of all stablecoins that we can talk about more. But every single unit of dai, basically every single unit of everything, like every stable coin, needs to be borrowed into existence by someone. And you used to have the situation in the past where when you have more demand to hold the coin than to create it through borrowing, then the coin just depacks upwards, right? And it trades above $1.
00:08:51.746 - 00:09:44.326, Speaker A: And this was the case for a long time for maker. So there was more demand to hold the coin than to create it. And there just isn't enough demand to borrow, like a stablecoin, into existence only against crypto collateral. So we've seen that, and we've seen many instances of that. No stablecoin that relies on crypto collateral can get to a meaningful network effect, to a meaningful size, right? And so if maker wants to ultimately play kind of in the league with USDC and tether, then it has to get big. Maker either gets big or it doesn't make any sense at all, right? Because money is a network effect. And so in order to get big, it needs to be scalable on the supply side.
00:09:44.326 - 00:09:57.290, Speaker A: And the only way you do this is by accepting as much collateral as you can within the constraints of this really liquidity and solvency optimization problem.
00:09:57.440 - 00:10:33.640, Speaker F: Well, let me ask you this then. Do you think, at the point where the protocol is right now, how the t bills are acquired, where it takes a few days to maybe move funds to the off chain entities, and then for the off chain entities to buy the t bills? And then let's say there is a situation where the t bills would have to be sold early because you have so many redemptions. Do you feel that this structure that maker has in place right now, could it scale like five x, ten x? Or do we need some kind of development on that side?
00:10:35.690 - 00:11:31.542, Speaker A: So, I mean, fundamentally, it should scale fine. What you're describing is kind of the difference between two very important concepts in stablecoins and in banking in general, which is the difference between liquidity and solvency. So solvency means that every unit of DAI that is outstanding is backed by a loan of more than one to one ratio. But the difference to liquidity is that it cannot necessarily be redeemed right at the moment when you want it. And then you can have the potential for a bank run leading basically to lead the bank to sell kind of its assets at fire sale prices. Really, this shows us that the main constraint that a bank has is liquidity. It's not necessarily solvency.
00:11:31.542 - 00:12:26.506, Speaker A: And so what maker does is it just keeps a bunch of DAi, or like USDC, sorry, it keeps a bunch of USDC and like assets that it can sell immediately in reserve. So it always needs to kind of manage its expectations of how many people want to withdraw, even in the worst case, in a given time period, and have enough money or enough assets, liquid to pay out all of these depositors when they come to withdraw. So this is the fundamental constraint that they have. And so far they've done, I would say, a really good job at managing that. And even if there was a case where let's say 2 billion die wanted to withdraw at the same time, then not everybody can withdraw. But the coin is still solvent. Right.
00:12:26.506 - 00:13:05.910, Speaker A: It's just that people may have to wait a little bit and the coin may also deepak to the downside. So maybe people just want out, and they want out now. And then die trades at $0.90, for example. But then what you see is, of course, people, there's like a natural arbitrage here, where people know that if they wait one week, then they can withdraw it for one dollars, and so they buy it now at a price that's nearly a dollar, and then they can basically realize their profit. So, I mean, I would say as long as the coin is solvent and does like a decently good job at managing its liquidity, then it should be near infinitely scalable.
00:13:07.290 - 00:14:12.480, Speaker E: Yeah, I'd just add that makers getting a lot more sophisticated around liquidity, as know historically it had a tremendous amount of liquidity in the USDC PSM, which for those less familiar with makers, the peg stability module, since you swap die for USDC at a one to one peg, kind of how she talked about. But now, makers kind of optimizing both for liquidity and generating return on the assets and the excess demand for Dai. And essentially what we're doing now is taking on chain analytics and using that to drive the asset allocation strategy. It's something that is called asset liability management. And we're trying to do this using purely on chain data. So, kind of looking at the liquidity demands of DAI historically, and all the different market factors and assets that we have, their duration basically boils down to looking at the duration, which is like the liability side of Daius. And matching that with assets on the asset side.
00:14:12.480 - 00:15:01.194, Speaker E: So historically, maker has been super conservative with super short duration treasuries. It's had a foray into some kind of bespoke, less scalable, real asset malts. Those journeys were absolutely necessary to kind of get maker to the point where it could, at peak, onboard over 2 billion of treasuries. And in terms of unwinding those treasuries, we're down to about 1.3 billion in treasuries now through the two primary vaults. And that's just showing that you can shift that liquidity, essentially from treasuries to crypto collateral quite seamlessly. Right now, it's at the very beginning of what this is going to look like.
00:15:01.194 - 00:15:51.950, Speaker E: Long term, there's friction off and on chain, but longer term, we're going to see a huge wave of these tokenized treasury products and tokenized money market funds. And that's going to make this process almost instantaneous long term. So makers kind of built this, what we call like a dual engine structure, where you have exposure to rwas and short duration treasuries during the bear market periods, where crypto rates are lower than UST bills, and then also the crypto collateral loans with the blue chip assets, where you can take advantage of those higher rates during the bull market times, like now. So having this kind of dual structure allows maker to become much less volatile in terms of like an earning asset, and much more sustainable and resilient longer term.
00:15:53.010 - 00:16:19.560, Speaker F: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I would continue that by saying that, or asking that this dual structure kind of then relies on the fact that there is demand for Dai, because otherwise, of course, you can't invest into these rwas and you don't have crypto banking. What do you feel like will be the main demand driver for Dai in the next, let's say, one to two years?
00:16:20.730 - 00:16:32.626, Speaker G: It's pretty obvious, right? It's looping steeth at the moment and then looping lrts in the. I mean, maybe this is a good transition point, endgame.
00:16:32.658 - 00:17:10.374, Speaker A: Or we can keep hold on Vance, because I do want to interject here. So this is not actually the case. So looping is not a use case for Dai, because when people just want to deposit Steve and they want to borrow Dai to buy more Steve, then at the end of that trade, somebody else has to hold the Dai. Right. And so that's why Dai really is fundamentally constrained by, there must be like a pool of people who want to hold it for some reason. That's not leverage right. So it's a very good question.
00:17:10.572 - 00:18:07.262, Speaker G: No, I don't disagree with that. And I think a lot of it also boils down to, or at least the demand side is like is it a PSM model that persists into the future or is it an Amo model that persists into the future? Is it a hard peg at a dollar as kind of mandated by the PSM? Or is it something that floats? Because if it floats and if it kind of is a soft peg, then there's kind of like this new aspect of demand where I think we're probably one of the larger users of dai today and we denominate a lot of kind of at least trading and activity in Dai and if you're going to sell us 97 cent Dai, we're going to buy that. And that's kind of like this different source of demand. And so I think it kind of depends a little bit on what the future holds and endgame is obviously going to be a large part of that in terms of how people think about the peg and what that means for demand.
00:18:07.426 - 00:18:18.970, Speaker A: Can I ask you a question? Can I take the interviewer seat for a moment with framework? Why do you hold Dai over USDC or USDT?
00:18:21.730 - 00:19:01.910, Speaker G: I mean, the difference between DAi and USDC in my mind is just the lending facility and we're large ETh holders and it's the fastest, cheapest, most efficient way to borrow. It also has the least tax consequences. And so if we go into Ave and we put in ETH and we get a ETH back, that's a taxable event for us. Dai and maker doesn't have that. I think that's probably not super well understood. And when we have cash, we put it in the DSR and it yields 5%. And so that's kind of how we currently think of die.
00:19:01.910 - 00:19:30.900, Speaker G: I would say we're probably one of the larger users. I don't want to get too specific into what our CDP is, but we're one of the larger users today. There's just really no facility like it. And in the future with endgame farming, it kind of totally changes the equation as well, where we're going to want more dai to do this stuff. And as ETH continues to run, we just have a lot more capital to work with on the Dai side.
00:19:32.070 - 00:20:11.920, Speaker A: Yeah. In many ways I think this is like the most important thing to talk about, which is what's the demand for die? And fundamentally it comes kind of from the differentiation to other stablecoins. Right. And so I'm 110% with you on the borrow side. So when I borrow in DFI or anywhere in crypto, I always borrow from maker because it's the most tax efficient, has the best rates, period. Borrowing die is like, bar none, kind of the best way to get leverage. It's, to me, the demand side, I think, where maker is really constrained right now, right.
00:20:11.920 - 00:21:09.694, Speaker A: If there was 5 billion die more outstanding, then maker could easily put it into TBU, right? But they can't, because people don't actually want to hold more die than they want right now. And I think it's very interesting to ask why that's the case. Why is USDC growing? Why is USDT growing? But why is Dai really flat for a long time? And I think the yield itself cannot just be the answer, because I can get 5.5% on my USDC on Coinbase, and I can get 7% on my USDC in Ave. So why should I put it in maker? Why should I put it in the DSR? It doesn't make a ton of sense. So I think the answer must be somewhere else. Like, it must be in the network effect, or in the decentralization or in the brand.
00:21:09.694 - 00:21:37.450, Speaker A: Like, people feeling more secure in Dai than something else. And this is a thing that maker has been neglecting, I would say now, for a long time, they've been very focused on the supply side, and they've been very focused on the governance side. And I would say almost for two years, they haven't been focused on the demand side at all. And you can see that in the supply outstanding.
00:21:38.110 - 00:22:38.846, Speaker G: So maybe just like my thought process at least, and why we bought maker and why we're bullish on it is, I'd agree with you. The status quo is basically like, the demand is the demand, and they're rotating from real world assets or t bills into crypto denominated backed loans. And the rate limiter for how big the protocol can get is kind of like, how much do you want to draw out of the t bills and use to finance these crypto loans? And so why would you hold Dai? Going forward, in my mind, why you would hold DAi is to farm spark, is to get chronicle tokens, is to get all of the different subdou tokens that exist today. And you think of it this way, I think personally, the subdows will come out around, like, if you add them all up and all the tokens that will be given to maker, it's probably going to come out around like four to 5 billion total. Like, every single token that launches today is launching in a billion. So just there's five of them. Add them all up.
00:22:38.846 - 00:22:59.480, Speaker G: Four to 5,000,000,075% of that will go to die holders. So let's make it. We're going to five to. Okay, 4 billion is going to go to die holders and you're going to give 25% of that out a year. So there's over four years. So there's 4 billion. You give out a billion a year to all die holders to go farm it.
00:22:59.480 - 00:24:08.730, Speaker G: And let's say they farm that at a rate of 10%. So you'll probably have like five to 10 billion farming, a billion of incentives over the first few years, and that's doubling the dye supply. And then it's like a question of, can you get into this reflexive flywheel where you're kind of giving out the equity like tokens to get the DAI and liquidity to go give crypto loans to people, or frankly, T bill loans? Do you do something with the PSM where you transition it into an amo and you make it more of like a game for people like us? If that game starts, we're going to really love to play it because we can just basically pay off our debt cheaply if it deep egs to the downside, obviously, if it deepgs the upside, we have a different problem. But in an environment of rising dye supply, that shouldn't really happen. And so I think the line of sight to like ten to 20 billion die is pretty clear to me while these subdows are up and kicking, basically. But I think to your point, why do people hold USDC versus Dai? I think a lot of it does have to do with the branding of Dai. Dai just sounds bizarre.
00:24:08.730 - 00:24:56.726, Speaker G: And if you have like a. I don't know what the new brand of maker is or what the new brand of the stablecoin is, but if it's like USD something, I think you're immediately going to get a lot more people that will hold it. And last thing I'll say, I know, I've been talking for a little bit. The other thing that I would say is things like Athena and specifically on chain derivatives, where you think about it like this, let's say Athena and maker partnered up and a subdow style relationship where maker gives dye to Athena. Maybe they even give like SDI to Athena. They use that to go off and basically on a synthetic style exchange, short know, capture that funding. Like, you don't have any liquidity pressure on Dai.
00:24:56.726 - 00:25:08.190, Speaker G: You don't need to sell that derivatives are kind of like this, just natural supply sink for stablecoins. I think that could be another avenue of growth and demand for stablecoins broadly on chain. So that's my perspective.
00:25:12.210 - 00:25:12.526, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:12.548 - 00:26:19.750, Speaker E: I just add one thing that's really interesting to me about the subdow launches is it's one of the most fair launch systems that I've kind of seen in my career in crypto. And what I mean by that is the vast majority of the supply is being emitted through these front end token farms, where you lock up either Dai or MKR. And the only way you can farm this token is by going down one of those two paths. There's no pre sale, there's no vc investors, there's no massive insider allocation. It's all being emitted to the community. And for people that want to participate in the ecosystem. And as Vance mentioned, there is, I think, quite a reflexive nature of you need dai or mcare to farm these tokens, which, if Vance's estimates are right, is going to put a ton of buy pressure and upward pressure on dice peg, which will lead to USDC inflows, which will be used to either subsidize crypto collateral lending or put into us treasuries.
00:26:19.750 - 00:27:11.122, Speaker E: And then you have higher cash flows from that, higher dice wides being allocated. So there could be somewhat of a significant growth through this process. But a lot of the details are kind of still being worked through, and we're not sure what the exact form will look like. We've put a lot of detail in the report around the existing envision structure for how the tokens will be emitted. But there's a lot of thought being put into kind of how the value will flow kind of back and forth between MKR and the new subdoub tokens. Because on one hand, a lot of this revenue was going to maker core as it is today, will be going to the subdos in the future. But to offset that, you basically require owning maker to farm this effectively or die.
00:27:11.122 - 00:27:22.330, Speaker E: Right? So I think that'll kind of offset any price pressure from people wanting to get exposure to the subdoubs by kind of being required to own MKR or die to get involved.
00:27:23.950 - 00:27:50.926, Speaker G: One last thing is that there's going to be maker inflation too. I think it's like 3% or something, or maybe a little bit more than that. But you can think of it as subdoubs come out hot, people are farming them, say there's like 5 billion more die farming them. You've got 10 billion of Dai earning at about 6% per year. So that's 600 million. You net the DSR out of that, you net all the costs out. You're probably like 300, maybe 400 million of revenue at that point of earnings.
00:27:50.926 - 00:28:25.322, Speaker G: At that point that goes back to buying the maker token. It goes higher, the inflationary rewards are worth more that are going to die farmers, just like the maker. Inflationary rewards. So a lot of the endgame plan is to, in my mind at least, to make this reflexive. And you can kind of think of it as kind of like restaking where it's like all these know they're going to give tokens to ETh holders and that'll do something for Eigen layer and it'll be. Things are kind of all kind of the same to me at least. And it's just a matter of who has the best kind of like subdou tokens.
00:28:25.322 - 00:28:36.810, Speaker G: And spark alone is like 8th on defi llama at this point. If that keeps growing, that's going to be a seriously valuable protocol. And it's just like amazing that maker has that in their ecosystem.
00:28:36.890 - 00:28:57.302, Speaker B: What's up everyone? March is approaching fast, and I want to give you another reminder not to miss out on Das London. It is coming. It's right around the corner, and it's in March. From the 18th to the 20th, we have three full days of content. This is your chance to bump shoulders with some of the world's top executives and have open dialogue with both attendees and speakers. We're going to be focusing on a range of topics that I'll let Ren discuss for you.
00:28:57.356 - 00:29:42.290, Speaker C: First on the list we have bitcoin catalyst, the halving and spot ETF. Next we have a view from the buy side from investors on things like strategy, portfolio allocation and more. We also have a topic on rwas, tokenization and stablecoins, which I think we can all agree are going to pay large role in crypto's future. We'll also talk about global regulatory frameworks like compliance, best practices, and the evolution of global standards that are shaping the global investment landscape. We'll also have someone from the institutional front to talk about infrastructure such as banking and payments, with financial giants like Visa and JPMorgan, and last on the list, the macro case for digital assets.

00:29:42.290 - 00:29:43.282, Speaker C: See you in London.
00:29:43.346 - 00:29:54.730, Speaker D: I think that'd actually be a good spot to maybe start more high level on the end game plan, maybe. Mark, since you wrote this really comprehensive report, you can start there, because I think a lot of people are still confused about what actually is the endgame.
00:29:55.390 - 00:30:44.970, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. And I guess I'll just brief this by saying I am in no way maker endgame expert. It's constantly evolving, and even what we wrote in the report is likely to kind of change as the end game continues to evolve and iterate. I know there's a lot of thinking and kind of like Steel Manning about how we can make this even better, more sustainable, more resilient, more scalable. So take everything I say with a grain of salt, but high level. As Maker dissolved the foundation in mid 2021 and transitioned to the Dow, there were a number of teams that basically spun up as independent contributors called core units. And I think kind of what ended up happening and leading to the end game was there's kind of a lot of fighting over resources politically.
00:30:44.970 - 00:31:49.082, Speaker E: And I think rune kind of saw this and wanted to create a better system to align incentives with value creation in the maker ecosystem. So part of that is by continuing to innovate. And that's sometimes at OD with decentralization, because to innovate, you need to be centralized, you need to move quickly, you make decisions fast. And Nomaker's decentralized protocol is all about kind of moving slowly and not taking too risky decisions too quickly. So it's kind of created this. Kind of created this new model where you start to ossify and simplify the core and push the innovation to the subdoubs, where they can kind of be like testing grounds and almost like pure types of allocation strategies. So spark, you see the money markets protocol based off of Ave V three, but they've got a ton of new exciting features in the pipeline that the team over there is super excited to unveil.
00:31:49.082 - 00:32:50.450, Speaker E: And I think some people are kind of downplaying what Spark is doing. Even with the massive TvL growth that Vance mentioned, they've got a very top tier team, and I think they're going to surprise a lot of people going into the back half of this year and next year. And also on the subdao side, there's the RWA subdos, and they're going to have a lot more autonomy and flexibility to do. Interesting, and I think very value accretive deals for MKR, but essentially this is supposed to kind of. It does add complexity now, especially with all the rules and stuff being created, all the tokenomics and value flowing back and forth. But long term, the idea is basically simplify awesome buy maker core, push innovation to the edges and then scale successful innovations and creative products that actually end up working to continue to grow the maker ecosystem.
00:32:52.870 - 00:33:00.360, Speaker D: There's also something in there about the MKR token and value accrual redesign. Can you speak to that a little bit?
00:33:01.450 - 00:34:06.650, Speaker E: Yeah, I think Maker is basically kind of underwriting the subdaus. It's extending essentially like a line of credit through die minting. And the subdals basically have to follow certain rules outlined in the stability scope, which is one of the five kind of core scopes of the end game plan. I think maker kind of is giving away some value, quote unquote, because you're emitting the vast majority of these new tokens to the community. Right. So that value though is kind of staying in the ecosystem because the subdows are incentivized to own MKR lps like MKR paired with the subdoub token called elixir. And so there's going to be buyback pressure from the subdow MKR pair into subdos and that'll lead to more, I think, value occurring back to MKR.
00:34:06.650 - 00:34:52.758, Speaker E: But again, a lot of the kind of value flows are, I think, still being finalized. But I would definitely encourage anyone that owns MKR to kind of understand how the tokenomics work and if they have feedback, get engaged in the community. Because everyone in the community is trying to work towards making this more sustainable and scalable. Obviously there's some risk. We don't want it to be too boom bust. We want it to be booming and sustainable growth. We wanted to bring a lot more visibility to kind of what's going on with Maker in this report to kind of lower the barrier to entry to participating in the end game, which is, I think raise temporarily the barrier to entry in Maker.
00:34:52.758 - 00:35:20.290, Speaker E: Dows are already super complex places to operate. And one of kind of our missions at stakehouse is to pioneer, open and transparent finance. A big part of that is transparency, visibility into what's going on these big dows and protocols, and lowering the barrier to entry to participation. So we want daos to actually be successful long term. We need more broad and diverse opinions and engagement in the daos.
00:35:20.870 - 00:35:38.234, Speaker F: Yeah, I kind of want to zoom in on the whole subdao structure because, or actually this goes out to Hasu. I know you've been quite vocal about the structure, maybe having some inefficiencies or other problems. Would you like mind kind of zooming in on that end?
00:35:38.432 - 00:36:37.370, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So I've been a vocal critic of the endgame plan, I would say, but I want to caveat that by saying that I've been an MKR holder for a long time and I'm still a significant holder. And so I'm overall very bullish on the project and its potential. It's just that I don't agree with everything that kind of mean. Mark was basically giving, I think, a very good representation of what are really the positives of the endgame plan. So creating kind of a narrow dowel at the core that's easier kind of to oversee and easier to manage and easier to secure, I think that's very positive. And pushing innovation to the edges.
00:36:37.370 - 00:37:13.218, Speaker A: So that's the part that I really strongly agree with, I would say. I think the downsides of the plan and how it was executed is basically four different things. So I think, one, it actually has been creating more complexity rather than simplify. And so this might be a temporary thing. Right. But as of today, I think endgame is extremely difficult to understand. And I think it just ends up increasing kind of the complexity of the project and increase the risk surface.
00:37:13.218 - 00:37:41.022, Speaker A: Number two, as a result of this huge overhaul, I think it really slows down the protocol in many ways. Right. There's many things that could have been built that haven't been built because maker is so inwardly focused on governance instead of outwardly focused on its users. And so that's going back to the point that I was making earlier, that for two years, Maker hasn't really been focused on Dai holders at all. So they turned on the DSR. Great. Okay.
00:37:41.022 - 00:38:47.606, Speaker A: But that's like a one line change. There's a million things that could be done to make Dai more liquid, more accepted, make it more useful, for example, as like a payments vehicle or savings vehicle, or make it easier to buy for different groups of users, et cetera. All of these things that could have been done that haven't been, because now we are focused on the end game instead. So that's, I think, the opportunity cost of it. And number three is, I would say, the way that it was done, because kind of the end game, I mean, maker is a very vibrant community. It's probably like after, in terms of on the application layer, I would say it's the app that has kind of the most diverse and most decentralized and most vibrant community of people who really strongly care about the project and kind of want to work at it. And the way that the end game was executed kind of politically, the way that it is bolted on, not necessarily to anyone's fault, but it was very controversial, I would say.
00:38:47.606 - 00:39:34.340, Speaker A: And it ended up pushing out a lot of community members and basically fracturing the community. And then the final one is like, I'm not a big fan of actually creating all of these subdows and subdoub tokens. To me, it seems like it creates a lot of unnecessary risk for a project that's operating on people's savings. And so I think when you want to be the most decentralized and conservative stablecoin, then one of the last things that you should do is launch a ton of speculative tokens for people to gamble on. So I know that I have a very kind of unusual opinion about that, but yeah, that's why I think, roughly speaking, why I'm on the most skeptical side.
00:39:34.870 - 00:39:37.750, Speaker D: Vance, do you have anything to add on the end? Any opinions?
00:39:38.570 - 00:40:30.694, Speaker G: No. I mean, frankly, we kind of got in after we bought our maker, after kind of all the political machinations happened. And I can't speak to any of that. I do think like, process of elimination, how do you grow Dai? There's not infinite ways and tokens and subdos that are successful are basically, in my mind, kind of like the only way to increase dai liquidity, or at least real liquidity for Dai to fund either crypto loans or RWAs. And I think the end game plan is pretty coherent. And it's just like a summation of lessons from prior cycles. It's like redenomination will get more people more excited about Maker, which will cause.
00:40:30.732 - 00:40:31.414, Speaker E: It to go up.
00:40:31.452 - 00:40:44.006, Speaker G: And the inflationary rewards are worth more. Okay, check. It probably needs a new brand maker. And Dai doesn't make a ton of sense. And nobody wants to hold a stablecoin that doesn't have USD in the name. All right, that makes sense too. It's like subdows, like giving away tokens.
00:40:44.006 - 00:41:17.922, Speaker G: As I said, it's like the best way to grow this ecosystem. And I think also in the same way that you see people gravitate towards things like restaking projects that want to be abs naturally. There's also that plus like a real economic use case for being a subdoub. You get to request infinite amounts of Dai. Obviously, it needs to maintain the peg. And whatever that looks like, be it a PSM or Amo future, needs to conform to that. And then I think there's also kind of know things about the PSM versus an Amo that are going to be included in the end game.
00:41:17.922 - 00:42:04.834, Speaker G: I don't know what the timing or frankly, like final decision on that has been but I think it's better to have it be a soft peg, stable coin. So I think there's a lot there. I also think the AI focus is obviously going to be very zeitgeisty if Maker becomes this AI chain and launching its own l one. A lot of the things that made coins popular, Rune is kind of internalized and put down on paper. And I totally understand people being either really pro Rune's leadership in guidance or frankly very anti Rune's leadership and guidance. My perspective is like, let Rune cook. We didn't buy maker to come in there and make all these political decisions and all that stuff.
00:42:04.834 - 00:42:20.620, Speaker G: The founder is the founder is the founder, and he's kind of the only person that can reaccelerate the trajectory of Dai. And obviously there's good and bad with that, but we're here for the ride. And I agree with the general plan as it stands. I don't think there's too many other alternative plans that you could go after.
00:42:21.390 - 00:43:16.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, when you say, like, let them cook, I agree with that. I think that this is one reason why I had my own kind of proposal for what Maker should do. But when I saw that for me it was more important that kind of maker has one clear and direction rather than that I'm right, or that my views are basically the ones that end up defining Maker's direction. Right. And so, yeah, I think this is like, if you had asked me like two years ago, okay, what's the biggest problem in maker? It's a lack of vision and it's a lack of direction that kind of comes from that vision. And so of course I would have preferred a different vision, but the fact that it has a vision and the vision, as you say, it is pretty coherent. I would say internally, that's good.
00:43:16.490 - 00:43:27.660, Speaker A: Right? And that's like a big reason why, in spite of disagreeing with the vision, I'm still bullish on maker and I'm still willing to invest in it and so on.
00:43:28.930 - 00:44:17.550, Speaker G: I've read some of your posts from back in the day. It does seem like there was some shared vision of some sort at some point, and turning off core contributors is not what you want. Same time, that's kind of like life in the know. It's like strongwilled founder has a like, it is what it is and kind of any way you slice it behind ETh and bitcoin and maybe uniswap now, Maker has the most amount of fees and it has a path to triple, quadruple, maybe even ten x them. If these subdals really do well. And I think a lot of it is like, how do you get the market to interpret this more favorably? Because the bigger the coin is, the better the chance you have. The more inflationary rewards, the more the subdows are worth.
00:44:17.550 - 00:44:48.054, Speaker G: It has this whole circular, reflexive thing going. And I think if Rune does what he says he's going to do, it's going to work. That's my sense, at least. And, yeah, I mean, it'll be interesting to see over the years how these subdows do, because these are only the first five. They're supposed to be a lot more like, imagine maker incubates like a DA layer. These things are worth like 20 billion now. It's like, okay, cool, we'll give those tokens away to dye farmers and maybe an l two.
00:44:48.054 - 00:45:20.990, Speaker G: And maybe there's all these things that you can do if it's under the banner of maker to incentivize Dai supply. And I don't think it's worth going after USDC head on and being like, we are a regulated blah, blah blah, whatever. Stablecoin. I think of kind of maker as kind of this cross between this gigantic AI driven hedge fund in the future, in the fullness of time, and a stablecoin. And I think that's okay. The worst thing you can do is try to create like a USDC clone, like a Pax stablecoin. It gets like $50 million in inflows.
00:45:20.990 - 00:45:37.590, Speaker G: That's just not interesting. Let's try to do something different. That's my perspective. And endgame, whatever you think of it, is extraordinarily either different or strange or very compelling. But I think it's pretty cool. So we're bullish.
00:45:37.930 - 00:45:47.094, Speaker D: Whatever happened to the idea of forking the SVM and using that for the endgame? Is that still on the table? I'm not completely caught up, so just curious.
00:45:47.142 - 00:46:01.840, Speaker G: There changes, like, know depends on who you ask. But I think it's like maker having its own chain is in the future, probably like a couple years away. If it's SBM or if it's something else based, we'll see.
00:46:03.890 - 00:46:04.602, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:04.756 - 00:46:47.694, Speaker F: Okay, so it seems that there's. Or you believe that there's like a lot of the. Let's say maybe I need to say before I say anything else, that not financial advice and don't trust me. So maybe you're saying that in the future, more of the valuation will drive from this flywheel type of action instead of currently, where revenue and profits are super high. Because the revenue isn't that cyclical right now. And then rwfs have been a big driver. So do you think that will flip where now, I guess maker is seen as one of these dino coins from D five 1.0.
00:46:47.694 - 00:46:55.390, Speaker F: And then the market will at some point realize that, okay, now this thing is getting interesting and we should just buy the token.
00:46:57.090 - 00:47:36.510, Speaker G: I mean, the flywheel and then the branding are the two things. Celestia has like $75 a day in DA fees and it's valued at 20 billion. Maker has 120,000,000 of earnings per year and it's valued at 2 billion. So it's just about changing the market's perception of that. And maker is too expensive and the name is weird, so we need to change that. And so I think you can think of it as where are the fundamentals going that's going to be driven by endgame? And then what is the multiple expansion going to be driven by? It's probably like the redenomination and branding. And these are not things that are native to crypto.
00:47:36.510 - 00:47:46.050, Speaker G: Tesla has done so many stock splits, companies have changed their name and rebranded many times. I think this is like a well worn playbook, frankly.
00:47:46.550 - 00:48:39.074, Speaker E: Yeah, I think kind of what's unique to this transition to the endgame plan is that you kind of have like this spinoff or divestiture of these pieces of maker and they're kind of like focused on very specific verticals. The money markets with Spark and the RWA side with these other two new RWA focused subdos. So if you want to kind of participate in those communities, it's much easier to do so and kind of find where you're going to go. On the flip side, you need to own like Dai or MKR to participate in that new value creation. I think that's something that a lot of people haven't really understood yet so far. One of the things we've kind of tried to do in this report is kind of lay out like the tokenomics they stand today in the maker atlas. So for subdows, you start with 4.6
00:48:39.074 - 00:49:08.602, Speaker E: billion token supply. 600 million is for the workforce team. The rest of the 4 billion is completely emitted through the farms. So 70% of that 4 billion is going to thai farmers, 30% to MTR farmers. It's emitted over ten years, heavily front end weighted. So a billion the first two years. A billion each year for the first two years, then goes down by half every two years until the last four years, which is the same emission rate.
00:49:08.602 - 00:50:04.106, Speaker E: I think a lot of people haven't really done the math on kind of how that'll impact the maker ecosystem. Frankly, Vance was really one of the few people that actually mentioned that to me. I spend a ton of time on maker, and I don't think anyone that everyone that owns maker obviously has the time to do that. But especially if you're looking at allocating capital in the space, you need to understand what's going on with these dows. It's easy to kind of focus on the new hot things and the super high value valuations of stuff like Celestia, but there's a ton of interesting things going on in d five 1.0 tokens that I think you'll need to pay attention to. And that's kind of one of the things that we wanted to do with this report, is kind of show some of the exciting things, provide some more visibility, hopefully make it a little more digestible than the peer documentation that exists in the maker governance forms.
00:50:04.106 - 00:50:07.390, Speaker E: So hopefully this was a step in the right direction.
00:50:08.770 - 00:50:54.350, Speaker G: One thing that I just think about as an investor, like the redenomination, the lock staking the start of the maker, inflationary rewards, probably sometime this summer. I think that's like a major catalyst for people to wake up and realize this. But the other one is the spark airdrop that's happening in May. And I think they're airdropping 2% of their supply at some point in May. And it's highly possible that the spark token FDV is worth roughly the same amount as maker. When it comes out and you think about it and it's like, okay, well, they're going to give all these tokens to maker holders, so you should probably just add that expected value into your maker valuation, whatever you think it's worth. But I think all of this starts relatively soon, and it's been a plan that's been two years in the making.
00:50:54.350 - 00:51:08.740, Speaker G: Probably it's going to take longer than people think, but it's going to start being hard to ignore. In the same sense that if you're holding a TIA and you get dimension airdrops, you're just baking that into the cake of what you think it's worth.
00:51:11.030 - 00:51:40.114, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. But I do agree with HAsU in terms of needing to actually ignite organic demand for the stablecoin. Do you guys think maybe it's important for die to expand natively on l two s? Or what is the path forward for igniting that organic demand as opposed to just medium to maybe slightly longer term given the inflation schedule, but when you throw tokens in the mix, it's ultimately.
00:51:40.182 - 00:51:42.080, Speaker G: Not people who are there to stay.
00:51:44.850 - 00:52:30.538, Speaker E: Yeah, so I'd say that the organic demand is literally the greatest challenge for anyone operating a stablecoin. And you've seen tons of new stablecoins over the past year or two, many backed by blue chip protocols or teams that have completely failed to gain any traction. DAi is kind of like an incumbent early mover, has somewhat of a structural advantage over those. And there's no easy answer to generating organic demand. It can come in a ton of different ways. One thing that DAi and maker is trying to do is with the turning on of the DSR. So the DSR is above zero and actually at a relatively attractive rate.
00:52:30.538 - 00:53:11.420, Speaker E: People want to kind of integrate that into the DeFi Lego stack. So yeah, some people don't lock Dai in a DSRA directly, but if you want to earn a spread even above the DSR, you can put that in a lending protocol, a money market protocol, and earn even higher than the DSR. We want DAi to be broadly integrated everywhere, and that includes l two s. The big idea is basically heavily incentivize integrating the DSR everywhere as much as possible. This is kind of like a broad strategy to accomplish that.
00:53:12.590 - 00:54:36.902, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree. I mean, the biggest lowering fruit for sure is like replacing DAi with mean. This is the one thing where DAi would be actually differentiated from USDC and USDT, because those are not. I mean, you can get a yield on those that's comparable, but you can't get it on chain while holding the asset in a liquid way. So I think this is one thing then obviously, how come you can't easily bridge dai between different chains? Why is it not possible for me to mint Dai from collateral on other chains? Why isn't it possible to borrow it into existence from any chain? Why isn't there a zero fee way of teleporting dai? Like transferring Dai, like a paypal like solution to pay people with dai at no fee because recorded in like makers internal ledger, et cetera. There's like a million things you can do. Why aren't there any pairs like denominator against Dai in DeFi or in CFI or whatever, right? It's like why is there so few things that I can do with it? And this really speaks to what I meant earlier, which is the demand side for Dai is the much more challenging one.
00:54:36.902 - 00:55:50.590, Speaker A: And it needs a lot of active attention and investment in a very intelligent way in order to grow this because, yes, you can kind of do these inorganic growth initiatives. Like you can try to create kind of reasons for people to hold dye, to farm something, but every farm eventually runs out of incentives, and this is not something that you can keep going forever. Right? And so when you take the five to ten year look on maker, then you realize the inorganic things, yes, it can kind of be like raising yourself up on your own bootstraps. Because money is a network effect, and with network effect, the network is the value, right? And so maybe when there's more supply, it automatically is more useful to people. I think that's possible. But there's also all of these other features really, where Dai has the ability to differentiate and make a more useful network that people can use in different ways. And I think this is where I would like to see much more focus in the next one to two years, instead of kind of this inward focus.
00:55:50.590 - 00:56:38.780, Speaker A: Hey, let's change the way that our teams work. And it's like almost this in a startup where the startup wastes all of its time rewriting basically, like their software stack for two years, right? And it doesn't matter. It doesn't end up matter because there's like another startup that grows ten times quicker at the time because they are focused on users and creating value. Maybe they are a worse software stack, but it doesn't end up mattering because they grow to a size where all of a sudden the team that was so inwardly focused can no longer catch up. And I think that is the number one risk for maker. It's like none of the other things. It's like maker just being kind of too slow to focus on users and grow to a size where kind of its network effect can kind of carry itself.
00:56:43.650 - 00:57:12.886, Speaker G: I agree with some of that, disagree with some of that. I think of it in terms of milestones. I would argue the reason tether is so dominant is because Tether is so dominant. It just has a natural network effect of money. And the more of it there is, the more dominant you can be and the more dominant that can propel you to potentially become. And I think step one is like, let's get to 15 to 20 billion a dot. And I think if these subdows do really well, we can get there.
00:57:12.886 - 00:57:41.146, Speaker G: And you can imagine it, you can kind of see it. It's like there's 15 billion at die, they're earning 6% on it. That's 900 million of revenue, that's 600 million of earnings. They're buying back the token. It's going really well. The subdows are worth a lot, and obviously, we're going to need to figure out what happens after the subdow emissions have after that first couple of years. But in life, you knock out problems as they come and maybe die.
00:57:41.146 - 00:57:47.586, Speaker G: Supply crashes from 15 billion to 10 billion, but you have the chance to be more dominant at that scale than.
00:57:47.608 - 00:57:48.580, Speaker A: You do at five.
00:57:49.430 - 00:58:03.766, Speaker G: And, yeah, it's so hard to tell why. I think about USDC going forward, and I kind of think they're in trouble. Tether, I think, is a solid number one, but I think the race for number two is much more interesting.
00:58:03.868 - 00:58:12.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, tether, you will never replicate tether because it's just like, tether is like an all time, like, top ten, right?
00:58:12.432 - 00:58:13.162, Speaker G: It's never going.
00:58:13.216 - 00:59:03.122, Speaker A: It's like so insane. But this speaks to what Dai has to be doing against USDC, right? Because tether is what Dai should have built in many ways. It's like this coin that basically created this huge network effect inside China, and basically was this trade to circumvent capital controls, right? And so in many ways, it's the decentralized stablecoin, and it wins in a way that a decentralized stablecoin should win against a centralized stablecoin. Dai should go where USDC can't. And tether is doing that right now. And it's not clear to me that there's room long term for another decentralized stablecoin, not the way that it's working right now. And this is, I think the big Dai is in the middle, stuck in the middle right now between USDC and the highly.
00:59:03.122 - 00:59:35.780, Speaker A: I mean, USDC's endgame is to become like the US CBDC, right? It's just to pivot into a government coin. And USDT's endgame is basically to be this decentralized stable coin that's like ungovernable, right? And what's the room for die between this very centralized and this very decentralized? And I think this is. I see the end game and I see, hey, it's like a better vision than it was two years ago. But still, it's not clear to me that it's like a long term defensible competitive position.
00:59:37.110 - 01:00:27.560, Speaker G: I think they've got some tools in their backpack, whatever you want to call it. They got the subdows, they got the lending facility. I think they've got the continued growth of crypto derivatives as something that, look, if funding rates are spiking and maker can just allocate Dai to something like an Athena, where they don't sell the Dai. It's just like kind of like this natural, like there's a few different alleyways for them or a few different pockets of growth for them to pursue. And I kind of think USDC is just going to get picked apart by the ondos of the world and the tethers of the world. And I would say they're more in the middle versus something like Dai, which is pretty small, has all these kind of weird levers that it can pull and it has a lot of potential to grow. I think USDC, they've had some inflows recently, but they're kind of still in trouble in my mind.
01:00:27.560 - 01:00:47.526, Speaker G: And the difference between USDC and DAi is that when interest rates go to zero, USDC has no revenue, DAi has all the crypto loans that they can provision. So it'll be interesting to see what happens. But I don't necessarily disagree with you. I think the prognosis is positive for maker just because they have these tools.
01:00:47.558 - 01:01:39.414, Speaker A: In their pocket, I think that's actually not mean. So USDC benefits the exact same way from demand to borrow against crypto. It's just that in maker it happens kind of in a more direct way because people can directly deposit in a maker protocol and borrow die into existence from that. And for USDC, there's just one interim step through kind of an arbitrage trade. Because when the demand to borrow USDC from Ave against crypto, for example, goes up, then that again puts pressure to mint more USDC. And USDC can basically charge money on kind of, let's know, the creation of that or something. I think USDC still benefits, but I agree Dai basically has to find a way to differentiate and to have some kind of unique strategy.
01:01:39.414 - 01:02:14.390, Speaker A: And to me it would make a lot of sense that it has to do something with DeFi. And maybe the rules tighten around DeFi. I'm not even sure that that's bad for Dai, just maybe because it raises the hurdles for USDC more than it does for Dai. I kind of don't believe it, the way that the regulation is trending in Europe and the US. So I think it's more probably going to be pretty good for DeFi. But yeah, definitely needs to find some things that you can do with the eye that are more difficult to do with USDC.
01:02:16.170 - 01:02:25.994, Speaker D: All right, I know we're up on time on the calendar, so I do want to round this out, but does anyone have any closing thoughts? Any bold predictions for Makerdao throughout the course of the rest this year? That they want to share.
01:02:26.112 - 01:02:28.490, Speaker E: I'll leave the predictions to Vance.
01:02:30.350 - 01:02:50.450, Speaker G: I think my compliance officer would kill me if I started throwing out predictions, so I'm going to probably sit this one out. But yeah, we're positive on maker and die. And I think whenever endgame launches, it's going to be kind of the first time that we can really even tell what's going on. But from the rough schematics, I think it's going to be very positive.
01:02:51.910 - 01:03:41.550, Speaker A: Yeah, you wouldn't believe it probably, when you just hear me talk about maker for an hour, but I'm very positive about maker compared to most other things in crypto. The reason I'm critical is because I'm afraid that maker is kind of squandering some of its enormous potential because decentralized stablecoin, that is still the number one killer use case in crypto, in spite of a lot of other things that you're seeing. This is like bitcoin and ether. They are trying to be money. But do you know what is already the kind of biggest adoption money in the world? That's the US dollar. And bitcoin will never break that. That's never going to happen, and neither is ether.
01:03:41.550 - 01:04:44.034, Speaker A: So the demand for USDC, for USD, will always eclipse kind of the demand for these more volatile cryptocurrencies that are really like more kind of the gold, I think, of the digital age rather than kind of the money that people used to save and transact with the world. Kind of becoming less globalist, in a sense, and more kind of separating into smaller pockets that maybe don't have the kind of cooperation of kind of the paxigamon area that we are kind of coming from. The ability to have this shared medium of exchange, I think is still enormous. So the potential for a decentralized, stable coin is enormous. That's why I would rather own 1% of tether than virtually anything else. Right. And I think die, nobody can get a piece of tether, but you can get a piece of maker.
01:04:44.034 - 01:04:56.300, Speaker A: And I think that is still the bullcase that die can somehow manage to basically become the tether 2.0.
01:04:57.150 - 01:04:58.202, Speaker G: Leave it there.
01:04:58.336 - 01:05:22.014, Speaker D: Yeah, that was a good mic drop. All right, guys, thanks so much for coming on. I'll be sure to drop links to your socials in the show notes.

But hopefully you have a better idea of the end game now and that will assist in your reading.
01:05:22.014 - 01:05:25.250, Speaker D: But fans, Hasu mark, thanks for coming on. We'll see you next time.
