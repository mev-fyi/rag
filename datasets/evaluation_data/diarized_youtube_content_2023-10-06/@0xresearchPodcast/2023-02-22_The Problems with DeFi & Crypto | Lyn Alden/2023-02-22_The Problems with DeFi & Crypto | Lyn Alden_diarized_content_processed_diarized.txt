00:00:00.170 - 00:00:10.990, Speaker A: Let's say a typical equity, right? You know, how it performs over five years will largely depend on its fundamentals, but how it performs quarter by quarter will largely depend on liquidity and sentiment.
00:00:13.490 - 00:00:45.098, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We are recording this episode on February 20, and we have a great interview coming for you with Lynn Alden. She kind of gives us a little bit of background on macro environment, which for a lot of us djens, we don't really pay too much attention to outside of the basics. So it's great to get like a more deep dive into that world. She gives us her views on bitcoin versus other l ones focused on smart contracts as well as her broader views of DFI. And unfortunately I wasn't able to make this conversation, but Sam had a great deep dive with her. So this is a great one.
00:00:45.098 - 00:00:57.690, Speaker B: But as usual, before we get into that, we are joined by Ren and Westy from the Blockworks research team to kind of have a little roundtable discuss everything that's going on in crypto. So I'll throw it to you, westy, first. Who do you have on the hot seat of the cool throne?
00:00:57.770 - 00:02:04.498, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I have opensea on the hot seat this week, which makes sense given Blur's airdrop last week. So to give a little bit of a recap, blur, which is a pretty popular aggregator for NFT trading, launched their airdrop last week and their token, and I'd say it was a fairly successful airdrop overall. I think 80% of wallets claimed within the first 3 hours of the airdrop being live, and it caused the highest burn we've seen of ETH since last June. So overall it was a very active airdrop participation and volume has actually since doubled since the 14th when that airdrop happened, which is pretty surprising given you basically expect the volume to drop off after an airdrop like that. But it's likely from people basically trying to claim the next airdrop and are wash trading. But at the same time, I think Openc is really feeling the heat from Blur basically taking their market share of volume, and they changed a couple of their parameters around as a result.
00:02:04.498 - 00:02:39.502, Speaker C: So their fees are now 0% for a limited time and they're actually moving towards optional creator earnings for projects that don't have on chain enforcement. And so yeah, I think Blur is really coming in to shake things up here. I think Sam was the one who had the thesis that Blur is going to take open sea's market share, and I think we're seeing that already this early into 2023, and I just don't see these NFT wars slowing down anytime soon. I think certainly not before we see some sort of open sea token as they try and sort of gain that market share back.
00:02:39.556 - 00:03:19.926, Speaker D: Yeah, I was definitely surprised to see volume actually double in lieu of the airdrop because like you said, normally it halves or even goes down 90%, as we saw with pseudoswap. So that was definitely an interesting development. I do think Blur is in a really strong position. I know Gem, I think it is, is working on their v two and it looks really cool and really similar geared towards traders like Blur is, which is exciting to see. And aggregators have had less stickiness when it comes to users. So I think they're going to be a pretty big competitor going forward. And if I'm not mistaken, I can't remember if it was uniswap or Opensea that acquired them, but I feel like they should bring that brand together under the same hood.
00:03:19.926 - 00:03:26.750, Speaker D: So that way there's more user awareness and less user fragmentation. So I'll be interested to see if they rebrand going forward.
00:03:26.820 - 00:03:58.280, Speaker B: I think the easy answer on why that airdrop or why we see these increased volumes is how effective that airdrop was. Right? Like everybody was sharing their claiming on Twitter and they weren't small numbers. Pretty much everybody got at least a couple thousand dollars out of this. It seems like if you were actively trading NFTs and utilizing blur. So this was like one of those generational airdrops. We haven't had one in a while, where people just actually printed on it. Again, it's like a cool revivalist moment for some of DFI and really just crypto as a whole.
00:03:58.890 - 00:04:28.162, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the largest person got roughly $2.7 million worth of flare tokens, which is a pretty sweet deal. There's definitely a lot of wash trading or sort of like incentivized volume, so to say, going on. Given blur season two is in progress. There was a will yesterday that was basically sweeping up floors. And then what they did is basically they instantly raised the floor price by say 10% to 30%. And for blur season two, there's two ways you can earn points, right? One is bid points and one is listing points.
00:04:28.162 - 00:04:47.522, Speaker E: The closer your bid is, what the four price is, probably the more points you get. And so basically what a whale does is sweep the four bid of the price by 10% and 30% and everyone else moves up their bids and then they sell into those bids and basically wreck off them. So it'll be interesting to see more of these strategies play out as season two continues.
00:04:47.586 - 00:04:59.930, Speaker D: Yeah, you got to think that they're going to flag that activity and exclude that wallet now that it's been so widely circulated. So I doubt many people will keep trying this strategy. But nonetheless, I was pretty witty by that guy.
00:05:00.000 - 00:05:02.574, Speaker B: Let's keep the ball rolling on the hot seat. Ran, who you got this week?
00:05:02.612 - 00:05:46.454, Speaker E: Yeah, this week I got China coins. So, like most people, I woke up this morning and half of my timeline literally turned into chinese or Mandarin. So that's been a narrative that's been going on for, I want to say, one or two weeks ever since it got announced that Hong Kong would be starting that ETF, and basically everyone thinks that's going to open the door to Chinese Asia, Hong Kong, whatever money you think there is in the Asia region. I think so far, it's been a lot of the western people thinking, what coins chinese people like, and the chinese people thinking that these are the coins that the western people like. So there's, like, a bit of a stupid cycle here, and, like, crypto, most of the time, not a lot. Makes sense. So a few coins that are being bid pretty heavily.
00:05:46.454 - 00:06:15.822, Speaker E: One is falcoin, because most of the falcoin miners used to be in China. The second one is conflux. So they're partnering with this app called xiaohongxu. It's like China Instagram. It's like a cancer social app that every Gen Z is glued to on their phone, but it has a lot of users, and so that's a big partnership that they have. They're also partnering with China Telecom, one of the largest mobile carriers in the world. And then there's also one more token called Phoenix chain.
00:06:15.822 - 00:07:08.114, Speaker E: They have a lot of partners, especially in the payment space, such as union pay, China Telecom, and WeChat. And if you're not familiar with WeChat, WeChat is the super app in the world. They have 1.2 billion users, and basically, you can do everything in life, interact with the government, pay for our utilities, pay rent, order food, order a taxi, go to the cinema, buy a ticket, all in one app. And another sort of slightly separate point into the Phoenix chain is that Phoenix has historically been a very sort of overpowered creature in the chinese culture, and so maybe people will bid that up. But actually, even though the western world is very bullish about all of these China coins, I've been hanging out in a few WeChat groups, and a lot of people in Asia don't think the impact is going to be that big, but kind of like the arbitram token. The sort of the idea of Asia bidding may be a lot more impactful than it actually happening.
00:07:08.114 - 00:07:12.566, Speaker E: And so as long as that narrative is there, or at least that thought is there, it'll continue happening.
00:07:12.668 - 00:08:04.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw a funny takeaway on Twitter from this was, you know, if the US is coming for stablecoin regulations on things that are pegged to the like, and now Hong Kong's kind of opening the gates to maybe allowing some of this crypto activity to occur within its borders, then all right, fine, let's not peg things to $1. Let's peg things to hk$7, which is equivalent to the price of $1. I was like, okay, I mean, that probably won't happen. It's pretty unlikely, I think, just given the US dollar's place within the global economy, but pretty exciting just to see a change of pace from a regulator saying, all right, let's open our doors, maybe let some of this activity happen. And so if we do see that ETF listing for either bitcoin or ethereum within Hong Kong, that's pretty exciting. I'd like to see that kind of keep flowing throughout the world. Right? Like Canada, I think, has those ETFs listed, or at least some sort of tradable fund.
00:08:04.120 - 00:08:10.674, Speaker B: I like to kind of see that being perpetuated throughout the world and hopefully just keep moving in the right direction, even if that's pushing the ball uphill.
00:08:10.722 - 00:08:43.474, Speaker D: I saw a cool take, too, on Twitter over the weekend. I can't remember who it was, but they basically said, I think the next bull run is going to be led by the eastern markets, and it's going to be a painful reminder that crypto really is the most global asset. And it doesn't really necessarily matter what's going on in the like. It's just as relevant what's going on in. You know, this is actually timely considering Lyn is on in this episode and she talks a lot of macro. So I'll put my macro hat on. But I guess the PBOC has been injecting quite a bit of liquidity into markets over there because they don't have as much of a battle with inflation as we do.
00:08:43.474 - 00:08:46.594, Speaker D: So that's definitely something to keep an eye on going forward, if you ask me.
00:08:46.632 - 00:09:02.362, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's funny seeing all these. What is the left curve narrative for the month? Like, it was AI, then it was ZK, and now it's china coins. It's pretty funny to see it jump from one to the next, but should definitely send it to Sam to talk about his cool.
00:09:02.416 - 00:09:28.402, Speaker D: Yeah, one comment on like, it's like the left curve narrative of the week now it's not even month. These things are moving really quick and it is cracking me up how forced some of the narratives are. So be careful aping into every single narrative you see on CT. But yeah, my cool throne for today is actually something I'm super excited about. I'm sure these guys are almost tired of hearing me talk about it. I blew up the Slack channel this morning. Our company, Slack channel.
00:09:28.402 - 00:09:56.250, Speaker D: But noster, I find it super fascinating. Basically you go to the App Store, there's different apps that are available for the noster, like kind of backend tech that you can download. I think it's called damus. Damus. I'm probably butchering that, but on the iOS store. So I downloaded that. And basically you create an account, you get a public key and a private key on the bitcoin network and you can send microtransactions over the lightning network using bitcoin.
00:09:56.250 - 00:10:50.886, Speaker D: So this is super cool, but the first thing I noticed when you log in is the timeline is completely unreadable. So basically you can connect multiple relays, and there's different quality of relays depending upon who you connect to. So some people are spinning up paid relays where you send like 1000 sats and then you get to use this relay. And then basically they store all of your comments, all your posts, all your reposts. Maybe you make a bio change. So it's just kind of like a permissionless system where you can spin up a relay as a weekend hobbyist, receive sats upfront as payment in order to actually store all these transactions and keep the network going. The main problem I see with it is the growth of the data that you're storing is going to grow way faster than the addressable market of people who are actually willing to send you 1000 sats.
00:10:50.886 - 00:11:31.606, Speaker D: And I was kind of like, this is really interesting. If I would do this right now, spin up a relay, and I have the state of all these profiles, then they're going to want to keep using me because I have their whole history. So there's kind of a way to generate a moat in my opinion, but it's going to get really expensive really fast. And for example, if you charge people 1000 sats, if you got 1000 people to send that to you, which would probably be really hard, that's only $250. So obviously this monetization method is not going to work. So I'm interested to see how it pans out over the longer term. And some people are probably thinking, well, what about lens? Lens, if you've ever used it, there's a lot of actual transactions.
00:11:31.606 - 00:12:02.174, Speaker D: Noster is like super fully off chain. The only thing that you really do with bitcoin is identify your profile. And then you can send sats to and from different people using lightning. So I'm interested to see how it pans out. I think another thing that people could do to monetize the relays is connect your lightning network channel to it. So that way you're actually transferring these different SaaS values to get extra income. And if you scaled that to like 100,000 different people transacting microtransactions every day, it could end up being substantial revenue.
00:12:02.174 - 00:12:08.274, Speaker D: But not exactly sure. So I'm not sure if you guys have any comments on Nostra, but I myself am pretty excited about it.
00:12:08.312 - 00:12:50.526, Speaker C: Yeah, so Nostra is its own decentralized protocol. It's not a blockchain and it's not, like you said, built on bitcoin. It's sort of its own separate thing. And you can sort of link accounts if you wanted to. The two biggest problems which you brought up in my head are, like you said, state growth or just history. Like who is keeping track of the history, who's financially incentivized? And then also just a general financial incentivization for the relays, like who's going to actually build these things that people want to be on? And then at the same time, if you have a relay that a lot of people want to post to, well, then you have a lot of history to hold on to and it becomes a problem there. So yeah, you compared it to lens.
00:12:50.526 - 00:13:17.754, Speaker C: But my biggest question is, why can't this exist on a current smart contract platform? Because one you solve sort of like the state problem, there's a lot of nodes that already are holding the history and state of the chain and are financially incentivized to do so. And then, like I said, you have that financial incentivization through a token where there's actually nodes running it and are doing so profitably. I don't know if you have an answer to that question, but that's sort of like what comes to my head.
00:13:17.872 - 00:13:58.006, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I'd just rebuttal that with lenses on polygon. There's like, what, 100 whitelisted validators? So it's really not permissionless. I think the whole point of, I guess like a decentralized social media should be that anyone can plug into any relay and anyone can spin up a relay. Because if I'm running a really good relay, for example, I get to pick what your profile sees, like what your timeline is. So this would be a great way to get rid of bots that you see on Twitter, for example. I really wish someone would just completely clone people's Twitter feeds and only let people reply and see the replies of people you're following, for example. I think that would be super interesting.
00:13:58.006 - 00:14:13.838, Speaker D: But yeah, to your first point on the incentivizing relays, I have zero answer there, and I don't know how it's not going to lose its momentum. They've already got 600,000 profiles on there, and every single action you do is something that these relays have to store.
00:14:13.924 - 00:14:45.650, Speaker C: I mean, on top of that, who's going to run their own private relay? No one runs their own email server. No one's going to run a Nostra relay unless they're really involved in the stuff. And so in theory, yes, anyone can set up a relay, but I just don't see that happening. Then another problem is sort of like a spam issue, because none of the posts, you have to actually pay for it in any way. And so I know they have a lot of spam problems already, and so that's just like another issue that I think could be solved through blockchain.
00:14:45.730 - 00:15:33.640, Speaker B: Maybe this is a hot take, but what if blockchain just aren't developed to the point that they can facilitate decentralized social media today? Right? If you think about l two s today, I feel like we talk about this a decent amount on the show, but they're not decentralized and they're not fully complete and fully baked out, these things still have so much development to go, as well as ethereum, the base layer itself. So we're still building on this infant technology, and maybe the state of the technology just isn't great enough to build such a demanding platform on top of yet. I don't know if you guys would agree or disagree there, but I feel like social media just has so much content and how can we actually process this on an l two today? I just don't think we're there yet.
00:15:34.410 - 00:15:57.150, Speaker E: I think an even more hot take is even if the state of the technology is built out and we can support that scalability and that transaction throughput, social networks won't exist on decentralized networks. The way I think about it is that even if we get like a decentralized social network with an equivalent user experience as to a social network built out by a big tech company.
00:15:57.220 - 00:15:57.646, Speaker A: Right?
00:15:57.748 - 00:16:34.540, Speaker E: There's not a lot of reason for a vast majority of people to move over. Maybe like 0.1% of social media users get screwed out of Facebook or their Instagram accounts, but for the vast 99.9% majority, it works fine. And I think the reasons why social networks take off, at least the trend I see these days in consumer social networks, is that they have some really cool feature that kids like. A lot like TikTok came out, and a lot of young people like the reels and then be real came out because you can take a photo with both sides of the camera at the same time. And then there was the app used everywhere in high school that allowed people to compliment each other.
00:16:34.540 - 00:16:47.294, Speaker E: Unless you get some viralness or some feature or mechanism that's really cool or gimmicky, and that seems entertaining to social media users. So mostly younger people, I don't think it will ever take off.
00:16:47.332 - 00:17:11.654, Speaker D: Yeah, that's definitely a fair take. But my one rebuttal would be incentives. Like, if you're a creator and you're putting your heart and soul into this content, and you can actually monetize it through noster by getting bitcoin lightning payments, of course I'm going to use that. And then same goes for lens. If I can refer someone to create a profile and get a kickback, then yes, of course I'm going to use that because I'm financially incentivized to do so. But I agree. I think we're a ways away.
00:17:11.654 - 00:17:24.742, Speaker D: But noster is like the first thing I've seen that's super exciting, that's come without a token. It's just really like grassroots, cyberpunk. Cyberpunk. Just very cool and ethos.
00:17:24.806 - 00:17:48.580, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely agree there. We can flip over the cool thrones now, though. Blue chip defi is sitting in my number one seat today. We got curve finance. This team's definitely laughing already, because I do love curve. I think it's great tech, and it sits in a very interesting point in the market. With the launch of Curve USD, its protocol specific stablecoin, it really feels days, not months away.
00:17:48.580 - 00:18:36.526, Speaker B: A vote just passed. I think it was prop 283 that enacted a new proxy contract that enables external price oracles to control the price of the assets in the pool. And why that's important is because if you think about the curve USD model, it is going to have the stablecoin paired alongside with a collateral type, so Ethereum. And as the price of ethereum changes, your balance between the stablecoin and the collateral will shift. And so, obviously, to make this work, you need to have an external price source to say, hey, this is the price of Ethereum. So we just got that last piece of critical infrastructure passed and enacted into the protocol. So we have no more proposals to go through the Dow before curveusd can launch.
00:18:36.526 - 00:18:54.840, Speaker B: It can simply be deployed. And then from that point, the only changes the Dow would make is things like parameter changes or incentive changes. And so we are feeling very close here. And so this is super exciting because they really pioneered a new liquidation model that we haven't seen before. And really, that boils down to.
00:18:56.570 - 00:18:56.838, Speaker A: If.
00:18:56.844 - 00:19:35.470, Speaker B: You hit the point of liquidation, instead of losing your collateral, your balance between the stablecoin and the collateral shifts. So as the price of Ethereum rises, you actually shift more heavily into that. So you're buying strong assets and selling weak assets, essentially. So it's a pretty exciting development that we just really haven't seen deployed before. And so, again, this feels like we're pushing, inching, and inching closer to the release of this. And on top of that, obviously, with a vote escrow model, you are very dependent on the amount of vote escrow locks that you get, right, because it's a very highly inflationary model. And so the vote locking serves to offset the inflation.
00:19:35.470 - 00:20:10.446, Speaker B: We just saw urine finance come pretty big with about 2.8 million crv tokens locked for four years. And that likely tells you that they're spinning up more products related to curve. I think we're going to see more and more staked EtH types of products come through the next few months. So I'm personally like, okay, now, if we see urine going for big curve locks, what do they need these liquidity incentives for? It's likely a new project. I think DGen Spartan was really the first one to kind of kick off the narrative like, hey, the next bull run is going to be packed with repackaging the staked eth yield. So definitely keeping my eyes out on urine for that one.
00:20:10.446 - 00:20:48.374, Speaker B: And even if we look at the volume on curve over the past seven or so days, we really upticked to closer to uniswap levels. Of course, still miles away, just given the tighten that Uniswap truly is in the market. And so right now usually hovers around 15% or so of uniswap volume, and it kind of upticked towards that 20% mark. And so the immediate question there is, okay, well, what changed? And recently launched a rocket pool, eth eth pool. And so it does. About half the volume of balancers are ETH pool, but only has about 12% of the TVL. So seeing some of these pretty interesting developments happen on curve, and again, I think the release of the stablecoin will really shift the landscape.
00:20:48.374 - 00:21:08.530, Speaker B: It's completely revolutionary, something DFI hasn't seen just to kind of put a bow on this. Curve is one of those base protocols that you see countless protocols building on top of, and that is like a really strong sign of a powerful ecosystem. So really excited to kind of see how the volume of curve changes over this next bull market.
00:21:08.600 - 00:21:34.186, Speaker D: The one caveat with the increase in volume is probably related to the increased stablecoin FUD scene last week. So I would take that with a grain of salt, but yes, I agree. Curve USD is super exciting. It's just such low hanging fruit from them. You can lend out an asset that's equal to a dollar to your users, and that's all interest revenue for your protocol. So I am very excited about this. I'm excited about Aave's go.
00:21:34.186 - 00:21:37.494, Speaker D: It's going to be an interesting experiment in protocol specific stablecoins.
00:21:37.622 - 00:22:29.494, Speaker B: Hey, stablecoin FUD is bullish for the number one stablecoin processing market. To your point about the interest that gets generated off curve USD, it's pretty exciting, right? If I have an asset listing for collateral that creates like a new Amm or a new liquidity pool. So let's say there was only two pools and it was an ETH curve USD pool, and like a wrap bitcoin curve USD pool. So because taking out a loan, I pay interest to the pool. These pools are inherently revenue generating at all times. And because of that, if they become deep enough, curve has the ability to lower the trading fees on these pools and basically create a fee list transaction between the two collateral types. So ETH and rapitcoin, and that's like this cool new primitive that we have never been able to consider, because to a traditional Dex, the only way to generate revenue is through creating swap volume.
00:22:29.494 - 00:22:36.058, Speaker B: So now this kind of like builds out the stack of what's possible and is really exciting to have Felix swaps between two major assets.
00:22:36.154 - 00:23:27.050, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like we've been waiting for Curve USD and go for nine months now. It was many months ago that I wrote a specific report on protocol specific stables, talking about how it's a huge opportunity for protocols to increase their tvl and revenue. And so to finally see that in action, I'm definitely pumped for it. And at the same time, another thing you failed to mention with curve is that they're implementing more gas optimizations when it comes to their trading. I remember there was a Delphi report a few months ago that looked at prices between uniswap and curve and which one was better. And they said that curve, more often than not, quoted better prices than Uniswap, but they had higher gas fees when associated with their trading. So I think there's going to be a lot of optimizations when it comes to gas to actually have their gas lower than uniswap trading.
00:23:27.050 - 00:23:33.662, Speaker C: And so if you have better price paired with that lower, like that obviously will bring a lot of volume as well.
00:23:33.716 - 00:24:10.650, Speaker B: Excellent flag there, wesy. Yeah, that's actually. So they're revamping the tri crypto pool and basically enabling a factory with it as well. So now any token can be paired along ETH as well as a stablecoin. And so one of the interesting things about the Tri crypto pool today is it uses tether instead of USDC. And if you go back and look at the volume leader in decentralized exchanges, Uniswap, they are like some like 60 or so percent of their volume is actually just the ETh USDC pair. So interestingly, this new tricrypto pool will actually be ETH and USDC, and then can be paired with any asset.
00:24:10.650 - 00:24:41.206, Speaker B: So this actually creates an interesting dynamic because now going between ETH or USDC and any other new asset that gets paired with it becomes more efficient. And so not only is the contract itself actually cheaper to interact with, but the assets that you're coming to it with are more readily available. So I'm super bullish on what curve is doing. I think they're really positioning themselves well in the market for the upcoming bull market. And yeah, just super excited about all the development that they have going on.
00:24:41.228 - 00:25:15.950, Speaker D: And also, if you just think about the average trade size on Uniswap versus curve, it's like a whale probably doesn't care about the gas and more about the price quote, but then for retail users, it's the other way around. So this could drive a lot of volume to curve. I just don't know about that front end. It's not the best one I've ever seen, even though they did just launch kind of a revamped version of it. I'm still not a huge fan myself, but I'm curious, do you guys think the protocol specific narrative will affect makerdown in any way, or do you think they're far enough along in kind of the real world asset push that it's really not very relevant.
00:25:16.110 - 00:26:01.120, Speaker B: I think they definitely have that interesting first mover advantage in being that first decentralized stable coin that hit the market. Even when we pulled back in this last bear market over the past twelve or so months, we still saw, I think, their supply outstanding, bottomed at like three or 4 billion. So that is still quite large on the whole. And then even they're not just like rolling over and saying, we're only going for rwas, we're kind of giving up on everything else. They're now launching that spark protocol, which is a fork of Ave v three, and still trying to keep pushing this forward. So I think there's a ton of active development going on. Anyone who spent five minutes in those governance forms knows that there's an army of people willing to back this thing.
00:26:01.120 - 00:26:10.014, Speaker B: So I think it's a more contentious playing field now, but I definitely still think they're the dominant market leader that is sitting in a great spot.
00:26:10.062 - 00:26:41.190, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that. I think Dai has a lot of network effects in Lindiness. Like it's been around a few years, whereas these protocol specific stables sort of have to prove themselves, whereas Dai has already been proven. And yeah, Dan brought up the spark as like they're expanding their offering. Yes, rwas are a specific focus of maker, but they're definitely keeping their eye on other protocols and making sure that they have the best offering they can. So yeah, I'd say they're still pretty solid, even in this market of more protocol specific stables.
00:26:41.270 - 00:27:43.498, Speaker E: Yeah, just adding on, obviously having your own protocol specific stable is good in terms of integration and additional revenue or fees, whatever you want to call it. But I think personally, at some point the market realizes that maybe we don't really need such a big, decentralized, stable coin, and maybe we're just okay with USDC and USDT. I know probably a lot of people will disagree out there just because everything must have a decentralized version. But I think the end goal, at least for me, is that at least USDC and USDT is composable with everything, right? Even if that means, sure, some of that may be censored by circle or blacklisted by tether, but as long as that advantage. I mean, just the fact that USDC and USDT exists today means that a lot of individuals living in South America or Africa can have access to the US dollar rather than some super high invading domestic currency. And that's a good enough step for me, to be honest, I don't think I have to see a world where the stablecoins that exist on chain are all completely decentralized.
00:27:43.594 - 00:28:39.330, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm with you there. And I think another interesting point just around what is a successful stablecoin? What's the spot demand for it? Do people actually just want to hold the token for its ability to stay pegged to one dollars? And a good way to look at this is not only like users wallets transactions, which pretty much most users I think we can all attest to, will stable into USDC. But is what about, what are the dows doing? So I just pulled up deep Dow and there are 158 dows that hold USDC and 117 that hold die. And there's about three times the value at about $650,000,000 of USDC held versus 200 or so million die. But it is interesting there's 117 dows out there that are willing to say, yes, I'll hold this asset because I believe it's going to remain to be worth one dollars. So it's cool to see that there is this spot demand. But at the end of the day, totally agree with you, Ren.
00:28:39.330 - 00:28:48.742, Speaker B: I'm always going to stable into USDC. It's very easy to use everywhere and it has in my mind the strongest guarantees to remain redeemable for one dollars.
00:28:48.796 - 00:29:39.386, Speaker D: Yeah, that's an interesting flag actually, considering like Bitdao, I'm pretty sure they hold like 200 and 5300 million of USDC. So that's probably even inflating those numbers more like on a per protocol basis, it's probably more likely that they're holding die, which is kind of cool, honestly, for the sake of decentralization.

All right, everyone, we are joined today by Lynn Alden, founder of Lynn Alden Investment Strategies. You can find her content at WW. Lynn Alden, that's Alden.com. It's great to bring you on, Lyn. I've been a longtime fan, so excited to chat today about crypto and a little bit of macro.
00:30:28.942 - 00:30:29.682, Speaker A: Happy to be here.
00:30:29.736 - 00:30:41.942, Speaker D: Most of our listeners are pretty crypto native and we don't talk much macro, so I thought it'd be great by just kind of getting your kind of forecast over the next six to twelve months, what you're seeing, what you're paying attention to to get us up to speed on that front.
00:30:41.996 - 00:31:57.806, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that the long short of it is that obviously there was massive fiscal stimulus in 2020, 2021, huge burst of broad money around the world with a lag that started to translate into higher prices on aggregate because there was not an uptick in production of goods and services, but there was an uptick in purchasing power of basically at least currency units. And so you had a lot of people going out and buying things and not necessarily a lot available. When you add things like war, geopolitical risks, rising tensions between China, the United States, basically some of this globalization maybe not going away, but just kind of not growing the way it was, maybe even pulling back to a certain degree. There's generally more inflationary pressures. And so 2022 was a year of central banks trying to fight back, trying to rein in credit creation, trying to get the air out of excess asset prices, basically increasing the cost of capital so that most valuations compress a lot of mal investment, gets kind of pushed out of the system. And right now we're kind of at an inflection point here in 2023 because fiscal policy is still very accommodative. There's still very large deficits kind of flowing into the economy, but central banks are still being kind of aggressive.
00:31:57.806 - 00:32:35.598, Speaker A: And I think one of the risks of a policy mistake is that normally, higher interest rates are a way to reduce money creation from bank lending. Right. So when we think of the 1970s inflation, that was because there was a demographics boom and banks were lending, they were creating more and more fractional reserve money. And so tighter monetary conditions were a way to try to rein that in. Whereas when, for example, we look back at the 1940s inflation, fewer people are familiar with that time frame. You had inflation that was just as high as the was not due to bank lending. That was due to fiscal spending, obviously, on the war.
00:32:35.598 - 00:33:11.954, Speaker A: But then that war spending would go back into the economy. And so you had a big up increase in the amount of money in the system, and you got much higher overall inflation, even though banks weren't lending. And basically, we have kind of a 1940s style inflation so far this decade. But central banks are kind of treating it as though it's like a 1970s inflation. And I think this is bound to cause problems in the years ahead. I think if I were to say it, overall, I think right now we're in a disinflationary period within what is at risk of being a longer term inflationary decade on average. I think we could get more ways of inflation before this decade is done.
00:33:12.012 - 00:33:41.822, Speaker D: Okay, great. That's super helpful. And now on my timeline, at least, because I follow a lot of crypto people, people are typically more concerned with the near term. And I see people kind of looking at a liquidity index, where they take the Fed's balance sheet and subtract the reverse repo and the TGA. So there's also a conversation going on with the debt ceiling and how the treasury drawing down the TGA account could increase liquidity in the near term. Do you pay much mind to that, or do you think that's kind of like an oversighted metric?
00:33:41.886 - 00:34:16.126, Speaker A: I think that's really important for quarter by quarter basis. Liquidity is not the only measure that affects asset prices, but certainly in the near term, let's say a typical equity. Right. How it performs over five years will largely depend on its fundamentals, but how it performs quarter by quarter will largely depend on liquidity and sentiment. And the same is true for macro assets, gold, bitcoin, certainly other cryptos as well. And so these things are going to bounce around in large part based on liquidity. And that combined domestic liquidity indicator is a pretty good one.
00:34:16.126 - 00:34:35.922, Speaker A: And there's three main components. And so we can kind of outline what's going to happen with all three of them. Right. So the fed balance sheet is anticipated to keep going down for now. That's basically the Fed's intention to keep reducing their balance sheet, which is negative for liquidity. So that's kind of the background direction. Then you have the treasury general account.
00:34:35.922 - 00:35:33.330, Speaker A: That's basically the Treasury's cash account with the Fed. And this one is inverse, where when it draws down, that's actually good for liquidity. That's pushing money out into the system, whereas when it increases, it's bad for liquidity because basically it's sucking money out of the system and then just holding it there in this void that's not actually flowing into anything. And the treasury targets to have around $500 billion just sitting in its cash account. But one of the things that happens during debt ceiling impasses, if it goes all the way to the end, is that one of the things they do when they can't issue more debt is they can draw down their cash account to keep paying their bills until they're able to issue more debt. And so, ironically, in the lead up to a debt ceiling that could be positive for liquidity, because all that cash is kind of going out into the economy and it's not being refilled. And so actually, since basically quarter four, that has kind of been happening, it's been offsetting some of the Fed's quantitative tightening.
00:35:33.330 - 00:36:13.662, Speaker A: So that's been pretty neutral. And then the third component is reverse repo activity, which is more esoteric. But essentially, that's just another big liquidity void that's been built over the past couple of years, and that's been showing signs of flattening and rolling over. And if that does start going down, that's generally positive for liquidity as well. So the way I would describe it is that until assuming the debt ceiling goes down to the last hour. Right, so assuming it goes into the summer, assuming that the treasury is not able to issue net new debt, we're probably going to see a TGA draw down, and that's going to offset some of what we're seeing in the Fed's quantity of tightening. So we have kind of a neutral liquidity situation overall, most likely.
00:36:13.662 - 00:36:54.030, Speaker A: I do have concerns around the second half of the year, because at that point, if the TGA is drawn down and the Fed's still doing quantitative tightening, if there is some sort of debt ceiling resolution, which you'd have to have at some point, and then the treasury starts refilling its cash account, that's sucking liquidity out of the system. While the Fed is also still doing quantitative tightening, that could be a double negative whammy for liquidity and so I wouldn't be surprised to see pain ahead. But in order to get to that point, we first have to see how long this debt ceiling impasse goes and how far that TGA cash account does draw down. That's kind of the flexible framework I'm working with this year, but it's subject to all sorts of change on kind of a month by month basis.
00:36:54.530 - 00:37:08.054, Speaker D: Okay, great. That's also super helpful. So last macro related question, how are you interpreting Powell's comments as of late, and what are you kind of expecting from the Fed over the course of the year? And I know that's really hard to predict, but just curious, your take on it.
00:37:08.092 - 00:38:11.260, Speaker A: So the Fed has been decelerating their rate hikes, but they're still doing quantitative tightening at their prior pace. And we have seen disinflation in a number of inflation measures. Some of them rolled over earlier than others, but now there's a broad enough rolling over that Powell has been basically a little bit more confident in his assertions around inflation heading down while still reiterating that they want to remain tight for longer. This, I think ties into some of the prior issues I said before, where he's actually cited the 1970s and Volcker a number of times, which is kind of concerning because it's more like 1940s inflation. And he's not really citing that period, I think shows somewhat of maybe a recency bias in that regard, basically around kind of the sources of money creation. The Fed also, when they were talking about inflation being transitory or not being too concerned about inflation prior to this, all know I also think they were showing a misunderstanding of money creation, which is kind of concerning from the biggest central bank in the world. It's not exactly what you want to see.
00:38:11.260 - 00:39:09.194, Speaker A: So my overall view is that he's getting a little bit less hawkish, but he's still reiterating that they're going to stay tighter for longer. And I think they're essentially going to try to stay somewhat tight until they break something. Right. Until you have kind of like illiquidity in the treasury market or you have outright recession, I think they're probably going to stay somewhat tight. Now that is kind of complicated because if you look out long enough, that can actually be inflationary. If you have high interest rates on very high public debt levels and you keep running deficits anyway, that actually pours more and more money into the economy. Basically, the federal deficit is a surplus for the private sector, which sounds good unless it's money creation, it's inflationary over the long arc of time, but it does spell kind of risks, I think, kind of for the rest of this year, I do think that the market is, I'm not betting on a soft landing, let's put it like that.
00:39:09.194 - 00:39:23.040, Speaker A: I think either you're going to get kind of inflationary breakout or you're going to get a recession that temporarily quells inflation. And that seems to be the way that most economic indicators are pointing to by either the end of this year or early next year.
00:39:23.570 - 00:39:45.042, Speaker D: Okay, great. Thanks for that. Now, you wrote a great article. It must have been two months ago. Now, I can be sure to post it in the show notes, but it basically kind of goes over your critiques with Defi and how maybe it's not the way people advertise it. But before we jump into that, I'm just curious because I'm sure your timeline is pretty much exactly opposite as mine is. Yours is very macro heavy and mine's super crypto heavy.
00:39:45.042 - 00:40:08.000, Speaker D: And I'm just kind of curious, what are people thinking after the past year? I mean, just this past week, we've seen binance get their us banking kind of access cut off. We've seen Kraken get in trouble with their staking as a service. And then you've also got the meltdowns of blockfly, Celsius, three, aC, Tara, et cetera. So people in your corner of the world, how are they thinking about crypto right now?
00:40:08.850 - 00:40:55.630, Speaker A: Well, so, yeah, my challenge is I'm in multiple corners due to the intersections that I operate in. If I look in the traditional macro area, most of them aren't really talking about crypto. A lot of them are kind of doing the thing where like, oh, it's dead, right? Kind of like how 2018, 2019, it just kind of not on their radar anymore. It's dead, including bitcoin, for that matter. Basically, they're just like, yes, the whole space bubble, it's gone. They view it kind of like arc style stocks, basically unprofitable growth stocks. Obviously, when I look at bitcoin spaces or when I look at crypto spaces, which are increasingly kind of two separate spaces with some degree of overlap, basically, the bitcoin people are generally in pretty good mean.
00:40:55.630 - 00:41:32.214, Speaker A: I was at Pacific bitcoin, for example, while FTX was happening, and so the bitcoin price was nuking, the whole industry was nuking. And people were, like, celebrating and laughing about it and just kind of rolling with it. Obviously, there's a lot of development happening in the space. People often talk about lack of bitcoin development. But of course, that's mostly base layer focus. There's actually quite a bit of ecosystem development, basically making bitcoin easier, more accessible, faster, more expressive, things like that on various parts of the ecosystem. As for crypto, this week was big.
00:41:32.214 - 00:42:20.934, Speaker A: I mean, the past couple of weeks there have been a number of people warning about increasing levels of banking system, cutting off various crypto entities. And then we've kind of seen the hammer come down on custodial crypto staking from the SEC, basically kind of looking at that as like an investment contract that is subject to regulations. I think this has been rather telegraphed since the FTX debacle that really kind of lit a fire under regulators, gave them a lot more kind of coverage to go after certain things. We've also seen a shift in the head of the commodities Futures Trading Commission. He used to kind of talk about Ethereum being a commodity like bitcoin. He walked those back in November, those statements back, and kind of would say, okay, bitcoin is a commodity. We'll see about everything else.
00:42:20.934 - 00:43:01.078, Speaker A: We'll leave that to the SEC, which we kind of know Gary Gensler's view on that whole thing, where bitcoin, maybe a couple of other proof of work coins are kind of commodities in his view, while everything else is at risk of being labeled a security. So I do think we're kind of seeing a shift away from some of these kind of centralized custodians, and I think it's going to disperse globally. I think some of it's going to be muted for a while because it affects how much big capital can go into it. It's a troubled area, but I think there's going to be future bubbles, future growth cycles in this whole space again.
00:43:01.164 - 00:43:22.854, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So you start out the article kind of discussing the problems with CFI. So like the Celsius, the blockfis of the world, and kind of how it's different from DFI. And you discuss GBTC there. Now, a lot of people talk about GBTC and they're like, oh my gosh, like 50% discounts and Ave, that's a buy. Are you still viewing GBTC as an attractive option to gain exposure to bitcoin?
00:43:22.902 - 00:44:07.894, Speaker A: Well, that's one of those things where that's going to have potential arbitrage, but the timeline is unknowable. And I mean, it could take years and years and years to get that unlocked. And you're dealing with counterparty risks along the way. I think for the vast majority of people, the best thing if they want to have exposure is you just buy and cold stored some bitcoin. That's, I think, the cleanest way to do it. GBtcs really, and some of the others are kind of an option for people that want exposure within a brokerage account and don't really have another option. And that's kind of been the shame of the SEC, is know, ironically, by not allowing a spot bitcoin ETF, they've made it harder for retail and institutional investors to access the space within certain those pools of capital.
00:44:07.894 - 00:44:51.094, Speaker A: Right. Roth Ira, registered investment advisors, all these kind of pools of capital want some exposure, and they have to kind of go into worse products than they otherwise would if they were to spot ETF. We see that, for example, there's a successful spot ETF in Canada. There's also similar types of products in Europe, Latin America. United States has been a pretty slow jurisdiction in this regard. And so overall, I don't think GBDC is very attractive, but it does have arbitrage opportunities if someone is willing to go deep in the weeds and kind of watch that process unfold. And the good news is we are starting to see more brokerages offer direct exposure.
00:44:51.094 - 00:45:19.198, Speaker A: So, for example, interactive brokers through Paxos will allow more direct exposure for bitcoin and cryptos for people that want them, rather than people having to go through these various vehicles that can fluctuate around premium or discount to nav, which I think cleans up the price exposure a little bit. So I do think it's going in the right direction, even though a lot of people are still kind of constrained about being able to buy the assets they want when they're stuck in a brokerage type of environment.
00:45:19.294 - 00:45:45.210, Speaker D: You then go on in the article to kind of discuss some of your qualms with DeFi in general. So you kind of call it a circular economy on smart contract platforms to basically just trade different coins, earn yield in different coins, that kind of thing, and that there's no real value creation in relation to the real world. So can you kind of elaborate on your points that you made there and if anything's changed since you wrote the article?
00:45:45.790 - 00:46:22.482, Speaker A: Yeah, and that kind of continues. A theme I've been writing about for a while now is that a lot of it is speculation, is circular economy fueled, rather than kind of solving utility problems. If we back up for a second, if we kind of steelman the case for this industry. Right. I think it's the idea of, well, there's a lot of ideas, but one of the big ones is asset tokenization, which is the idea. And you can kind of summarize like this. Us stocks, they trade for 19% of the time, right? So only a handful of hours each day, five days a week, no holidays.
00:46:22.482 - 00:47:27.926, Speaker A: So when you add that all together, us stocks on traditional open exchange hours are trading 19% of the time. They take generally days to settle. The settlement times come down over time, but it's still pretty long. And if you're say like a middle class person in Nigeria, good luck accessing equities from around the world in the way that people, a lot of other countries can, right? So you could phrase this as why can't we own traditional securities and trade them 100% of the time, buy them almost anywhere and settle them within minutes or an hour rather than days, right? So that's kind of a problem set that does exist and that is worthwhile to go into. The challenge, of course, is you're now intertwining technology and regulation, right? So that's inevitably going to be slow and clunky, but that is like a problem set that is worth looking into. And of course there are plenty of good cryptographic problems to look into. Basically various ways to compress and move around data is obviously very useful.
00:47:27.926 - 00:48:18.854, Speaker A: I think where the industry runs into problems is a handful of areas. One, you have an overstatement of decentralization, right? So a lot of things, what they do is they sacrifice some degree of decentralization. They make it harder to run a node. So now you're reliant on asking third party nodes to let you access the network rather than being able to run your own node. They basically have less fault recovery, right? So if a blockchain like Solana goes down, instead of this kind of natural ability to rebuild itself, like where you get with, say, proof of work, you have leaders in the space have to meet in a discord to restart the chain. Basically, you lack unforgettable costliness. And so you do a lot of these things that kind of still market as though they're decentralized when they're increasingly centralized.
00:48:18.854 - 00:49:24.420, Speaker A: I think that's one of the early errors. And then another one is a misalignment in terms of VC incentives with actually making a long term product. And so if you look in traditional venture capital, you go into the space, you do seed rounds, you do whatever rounds your fund focuses on, and now you're locked into a pretty long term relationship with this company. There's only a handful of ways to get exit liquidity, and they generally involve going through accredited investors and there's actually all sorts of problems with the whole creditor investor definition. But the point is, when you do traditional vc, you're only really going to get out by selling your assets to other people that have experience in examining these types of projects. So either your company is going to go public, right? So it's going to be big and successful enough to go public, and you can get excellent liquidity that way. Another option is that another company will want to buy that company, right? So basically a bunch of people with MBAs will examine what's been built here and decide they want to pay money for this and incorporate it into their company.
00:49:24.420 - 00:50:11.742, Speaker A: Or if it goes on long enough and is not bought out or public, you can trade some private shares in what is typically a pretty accredited investor type of environment. And I do think that there is an argument to open and democratize some of that. But in practice, what ends up happening is that a lot of vcs in the crypto space will lock up capital in a project, have much shorter lockup periods, and then dump on retail. And then years later you're like, well, whatever happened to that project? And it's like some stagnant thing. We're on to the next thing. Now, the vcs got rich, some of the early people got rich, and the retail got dumped on. And that project didn't really do something in such a way that acquired long term users and solved like a long term problem.
00:50:11.742 - 00:50:45.100, Speaker A: And so there's that separation between you can get rich without actually solving a problem. And so I think those are some of the kind of the key aspects of the industry that I think are, one, harmful and two, that more people should be aware of before they decide to what extent they want to get into the space. Which is, again, a separate discussion from saying there are some problems out there worth exploring and that there are smart developers that are looking into those problems and trying to work on those and trying to find efficient ways to improve them.
00:50:45.470 - 00:51:02.190, Speaker D: Yeah, I honestly agree with your qualm there. There are a lot of projects that aren't necessarily the most advantageous for retail investors to get into due to the high insider allocations and centralizations of their models. But are there any projects that you can think of that you actually kind of admire that you've kind of played around with?
00:51:02.260 - 00:51:43.550, Speaker A: Well, one is I've been bullish on the idea of stablecoins. The way I would describe this whole situation is that something like bitcoin is close to as decentralized as you can make it because there's no issuer and it's a bare asset. When you talk about the idea of asset tokenization, what we're essentially trying to do, or the industry is trying to do, is open up the user side, the client side, and turn it into bare assets. And so, for example, if I have a bank account, I can't really trade around, access my bank account. I can, it's called a wire transfer. I'm going through this kind of clunky closed system if I want to move money around. It's not a bare asset.
00:51:43.550 - 00:52:55.860, Speaker A: Whereas a stable coin basically takes a bank account and similar types of collateral, like t bills, assuming the collateral is reasonably high quality, which is not always the case historically, but you have bank like or quality collateral, and then you make the claim, the liability side, a bear asset, right? So it's like making a bank account into a bare asset so you can send exposure around. And what that does is even though it's centralized, I mean, you still have a central issuer. They're riding on banking rails that could get potentially rug pulled if, say, the US government went after them or something. You have a centralized issuer, but the client side is bare asset. And so that opens up things like, for example, if you're in Argentina, you have just ongoing inflation in your region. There's been a history of if you somehow get dollars, you can hold on the cash dollars again, you're not getting interest on them, or you could put them in the local banks, but that's subject to confiscation and risk that's happened in the past where multiple of these countries will say, we have a dollar shortage. So we're going to go ahead and take your dollars and we're going to give you pesos in exchange for them.
00:52:55.860 - 00:53:39.090, Speaker A: Sorry, try again next time. And you're rug pulled and you're out. So a lot of Argentinians are saying, well, I'd rather trust an external provider of dollars on my smartphone than local argentinian banks or physical cash. Right? So basically what stablecoins do is they give more access to dollars to people around the world that want them, and then you could broaden that to almost anything. There are gold backed stablecoins, there's all sorts of things. And you can imagine a future where many types of securities are tokenized and you can just access them more freely. Anywhere they settle quicker, they can be traded off hours, there's less kind of geographical boundaries for how they can trade.
00:53:39.090 - 00:54:04.058, Speaker A: I think that's an interesting exploration, but I think a lot of projects are just overly focused on kind of senior edge and kind of vc enrichment or kind of making use of the money they have. And I have pretty low conviction around the long term survivability of any specific platform, even though I do think there probably would be interesting technologies that emerge here.
00:54:04.144 - 00:54:31.042, Speaker D: Okay. Yeah, I think that's definitely a fair take on the same topic of stablecoins. How do you feel about like, do you think that has a lot of staying power? Because from my perspective, it makes a lot of sense to give circle a fed account or whatever master fed account, and then it winds up being this force that actually cements the US dollar's dominance and then also creates new demand for us treasuries. So what is your thesis there?
00:54:31.176 - 00:55:28.126, Speaker A: So I think they should, basically, there's both pros and cons, because from their perspective, it can suck capital out of the banking system and make it harder to rehypothecate, which they don't like. They actually want kind of rehypothecation. But on the other hand, what we're seeing globally is somewhat de dollarization on the high level, but not de dollarization among the public. Right? So the public wants dollars generally. I have family and friends in Egypt and they'll literally go out into a black market and get physical dollars, whereas you'll see a lot of central banks, they're not really buying treasuries anymore. Basically, the amount of treasuries held by foreign central banks has not really changed in like a five year period. You see some of these big powers kind of doing trade agreements in other currencies, like for obvious reasons.
00:55:28.126 - 00:56:15.922, Speaker A: Now Russia is selling energy to China in yuan rather than in dollars. And that's kind of know thing like that. You also see some kind of sovereign level blockchain projects to try to have different types of settlement rails. You have like say the bis working with Dubai and Hong Kong and the bank of Thailand. And they're kind of doing these blockchain projects to see how they can maybe settle value outside of the dollar swift system. So that's happening on one level. But one of the ways that the US can still have demand for its debt is to really kind of solidify the regulatory clarity around stablecoins and kind of, if anything, expand them broadly so that they're more available to people around the world.
00:56:15.922 - 00:56:56.514, Speaker A: And that would probably extend us kind of deficit financing for a number of years and kind of help the dollar dominate. Now, I actually think in the long run that actually probably wouldn't be great for the United States either, because that kind of keeps fueling our bubble. That makes us very uncompetitive in terms of producing anything. Basically, the stronger the dollar is, the harder it is to produce anything in the United States. It's kind of like this artificial bubble that's happening, but from policymaker perspective, I think that's something that they would like to pursue. And I think there's probably just different groups in the government, and you kind of get bureaucracy, and it's kind of like frozen and standstill. So stablecoins have been shifting around in this kind of regulatory gray zone for a while.
00:56:56.514 - 00:57:17.830, Speaker A: And I would like to see, one, just better transparency for collateral, and two, just more and more regulatory clarity, including just bigger banks being able to issue them, and just kind of like less uncertainty, maybe publicly traded companies just more and more involved in the space to kind of solidify that technology.
00:57:17.980 - 00:57:57.922, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely agree with you there. I think ethereum could ultimately be just a layer that transfers around stablecoins, and it'd still be massively successful and have a lot of utility. And I know that you wrote a little bit about the synthetic stablecoin backed by bitcoin, I believe, which is an interesting design, similar to LUSD, but we won't go too deep into that. How curious, I guess, are you about real world assets on chain? So I'm sure you've seen Makerdao, they're kind of bridging some assets to back dai as collateral. And I know that creates certain areas of centralization and censorship proneness, but are you bullish on the idea of integrating real world assets on chain?
00:57:57.986 - 00:58:56.038, Speaker A: Well, so that is another area where I think it threatens decentralization. Right? So, for example, just by having deFi so reliant on collateralized stablecoins, including, ironically, some of these stablecoins that were originally not fiat collateralized, that are now partially fiat collateralized, it basically means that anytime if regulators wanted to go after these types of platforms, they could do so through the stablecoin markets, basically have them even kind of demand a hard fork or freeze certain types of assets, basically control that space to some degree. But the broader topic of just improving the tech rails, so that basically claims on traditional assets can trade in a more digitally native way on smartphones and with less border restrictions. I think that's a reasonable outlook to look for. And I think how we get there, I think it's going to be a long and winding road. We'll see how far we get. And I don't really have conviction on any specific platform.
00:58:56.038 - 00:59:55.862, Speaker A: One of the challenges, too, is that that's going to be a very fee sensitive space. Right? So right now, if you can trade a brokerage account for free, now you're really paying for it because you're paying basically to get front run by Citadel, but at least in small amounts, we're talking pennies. And so basically, over time, trading costs have come down significantly. One example is when I bought my first stock, it was like a couple of decades ago, and I had to pay like $15 a trade to do it. And even then that was already, the cost had come down from pre Internet days where you had to call up your broker to buy a stock, right? So we went from calling your broker, paying a lot of money to these online portals that you're still paying a pretty significant amount to. Then you got down to, say, $5 trades, and then you got to free trades if you're willing to throw a couple of pennies at Citadel to front run you. And that's kind of the direction of that industry.
00:59:55.862 - 01:01:13.490, Speaker A: And so if you have tokenized trading, I think the fees are going to push down very low and assets will migrate to wherever the fees are cheapest. So, for example, tether started on a layer on top of bitcoin. When Ethereum came around and presented kind of a little bit more optimized type of environment for that, you had a lot of stablecoins flow over there, and then when that became kind of expensive, you saw a lot of stablecoins flow over to Tron and you almost have a bifurcation because there's two very different use cases, stablecoins so far. One is somewhat less interesting to me, which is like the trading leveraging defi type of stablecoin usage, which is still primarily on Ethereum. That's where people willing to pay higher fees, because you're generally talking about whales, people moving around pretty significant amounts of money, so they're willing to pay fees for it. Whereas when you actually have what I talked about before, kind of that emerging market use case, people that actually just want dollars, a lot of that's happening on Tron because that's cheaper. And I do think that overall, things that host stablecoins for practical kind of non speculative purposes will probably gravitate towards whatever's cheap, whether it's higher layers, whether it's other layer ones, we'll see, or just kind of like rails that are similar to blockchains but not necessarily blockchains.
01:01:13.490 - 01:01:20.578, Speaker A: But I do think that the general direction is towards digital tokenization of dollars and other types of assets.
01:01:20.674 - 01:01:40.140, Speaker D: So would your thesis be that bitcoin the slow moving, technically not smart contractless platform, kind of sees this activity migrate over and it's developed slowly over time. Or do you think Ethereum actually plays a role in this future? Are you just kind of bearish on Ethereum and smart contract focused platforms in general?
01:01:40.830 - 01:02:14.600, Speaker A: So I'm skeptical about having them embedded on a layer one. And I think there'll be a lot of competition. Right. So what does the space look like ten years from now? I don't really have a strong view, which is why I generally only invest in areas where I have a strong view and I don't really have a strong view. I think a lot of them are going to be dealing with technical debt, they have regulatory issues, they have competitions over fees, that kind of thing. We can also talk about kind of total adjustable markets. So really there's hundreds of trillions of dollars of assets in the world.
01:02:14.600 - 01:02:51.922, Speaker A: One of the issues is that money is so bad everywhere. It's like you have 180 different fiat currencies. They're all kind of like these local monopolies. So the whole point of money is to kind of not have to barter, but on the global sense it's really barter. Basically if you're a supplier or a consumer in different countries and you have kind of different currency systems, you're now bartering and you're probably using a third party currency like the United States or the euro or something. And so in addition, because interest rates have come down so much, they're below inflation. When you have super weak money, you monetize other things.
01:02:51.922 - 01:03:26.414, Speaker A: So people monetize apple stock, for example. They monetize the S and P 500. They say I'm just going to shovel money in my 401K into the S and P 500 for the next 40 years and use that as my savings instead of money, right? So you monetize that, you monetize real estate, you monetize art. Not even talking about digital art, but that's that too. But also even traditional art, people say, well, I'd rather hold Van Gogh if I'm rich than hold cash. It's just a long term indefinite, scarce asset. And so you basically having super weak money, you monetize everything else.
01:03:26.414 - 01:04:09.770, Speaker A: And so potentially the total adjustable market of bitcoin is to come in and say, look, if you want a scarce money that can move around as fast as commerce does, that's it. Now the potentially the total adjustable market for that is trillions or tens of trillions. Then you talk about what is the total adjustable market of tech rails that improve the way we do things. Right? So if you look at a major exchange like the Nasdaq, you're looking at like a $30 billion market capitalization company. If you look at the New York Stock Exchange, their parent company is something like 60 billion other major exchanges. Generally, you're talking tens of billions smaller exchanges around the world. You're talking about single digit billions.
01:04:09.770 - 01:05:04.330, Speaker A: There's also tech providers you're going after, I think, a different market, a different scale at that point. And I do think there will be tech improvements to these types of trading and settlement systems that include a more digitally native way of doing things. And if someone wants to go deep in the weeds and people do, and they want to figure out what they think is going to be in place 510 years from now and maybe be like a 100 billion dollar, trillion dollar opportunity, I think that's on them to look into. But it's just not really the market I tend to focus on. I tend to focus on the market for money, which for me generally includes bitcoin, stablecoins, and kind of adjacent types of technologies like that. But I do pay attention to the broad space because I want to see directions where things go and also pay attention to what existing things can be disrupted by new types of technology.
01:05:04.480 - 01:05:41.914, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And it's also one of the reasons why I read all of your stuff, because you're one of the very few macro analysts who actually takes the time to play around with some of this stuff on chain. And I think that's just paying attention to it is a very wise decision because you never know when things evolve. But back to bitcoin, since that's primarily your focus, what do you think about bitcoin's longevity in terms of subsidizing the declining block reward with transaction fees? I know you've wrote pretty extensively about this, but it's something I still can't see happening in the near future.
01:05:42.032 - 01:06:26.834, Speaker A: So basically, it comes down entirely to the question of adoption. Right. So if you look at how bitcoin works in terms of transaction numbers, in terms of transactions, it can do somewhere around 10 million a month. And you can also batch those payments so you can get tens of millions a month, kind of at most on the base layer. And that's in a world of 8 billion people. Right? And that's a world where not that many people currently do on chain transactions of any sort. The overall bitcoin and crypto market combined is still somewhat niche when you're talking about global markets, especially at scale, when you're talking about not operating in custodial environments.
01:06:26.834 - 01:07:14.086, Speaker A: So you say, how many people are in crypto, quote unquote. It's like, well, are you in crypto if you're just trading on finance? Maybe not really. It's like how many people are actually using on chain stuff, whether it's bitcoin, whether it's other blockchains. And the answer is not that many. And so if someone is bullish around the future of this adoption and this technology, if they think 1020 years from now, there will be a lot more than 10 million people that want to use bitcoin per month, like one transaction per month, then you're going to get significant fee pressure. We've already seen, I mean, just in recent weeks, this whole ordinals thing, people got enthused about putting pictures on it that's kind of filling up block space to some degree. And that works as long as fees are super low.
01:07:14.086 - 01:07:57.122, Speaker A: But basically, right now, there's just not 10 million people that are willing to pay fees to do an on chain bitcoin transaction. But I think in ten years, 15 years, especially when you have almost no new bitcoin being created. But what I will expect to be significantly more demand for bitcoin. I think there is a lot more overall fee pressure going to happen. Now, if that doesn't happen, that's an adoption problem, right? That just shows that for some reason, the technology was not interesting enough to people. It didn't solve enough problems, basically that their demand for money was either met elsewhere or they're just not really interested in kind of having different monies. And maybe they're still monetizing other things.
01:07:57.122 - 01:08:08.360, Speaker A: Maybe they're not interested in censorship resistant payments. Whatever the case may be, if adoption doesn't take off, then yes, you could in a number of decades get kind of a fee problem. But that wouldn't really be my base case.
01:08:09.450 - 01:08:45.090, Speaker D: Interesting, because to me it's like people love the fact that $1 equals one dollars. Even if you go over to Europe, you're sitting there having a hell of a time trying to figure out what one dollars equals in euros. So I think it's kind of far fetched, honestly, to think that in ten to 15 years people will be like, I want to spend sats, you know what I mean? For that psychology to play through and actually work out, it seems a little bit unreasonable. And that people will always denominate their net worths in their fiat currencies, at least in first world countries, you could definitely argue differently in third worlds?
01:08:46.150 - 01:09:33.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they will for a long time. But there's two things to consider. One, even if you're not spending bitcoin, if merely, like, say, more than 10 million people globally per month want to do an on chain bitcoin transaction in order just to take bitcoin off an exchange and put it into their own cold storage wallet, right. That's already now adding to fee pressure. If you get to that point where the number of people that want to do that exceed amount of block space, which is actually a pretty small number of people, if we ever reach that point, now you're at kind of a permanent fee threshold for how much on chain storage bitcoin can do in a given period of time versus how many people want to do it. And then number two, what we see is a lot of these types of wallets you can send bitcoin and it just tells you on the screen how much that is in dollars. Right.
01:09:33.330 - 01:10:04.666, Speaker A: The same thing can happen is if I go to Egypt every year and I use my visa card and know I'm just paying this thing and it's kind of going through those portals, it's converting from dollars, it's getting exchanged, it's winding up in that person's account in egyptian pounds. Right. And I think we're going to kind of see the same thing. We already are seeing the same thing in terms of bitcoin and even to even other cryptocurrencies as well, basically various types of integrations or different ways of displaying the information. So I think that's how I would.
01:10:04.688 - 01:10:28.614, Speaker D: Caveat that in terms of ordinals. You mentioned it. I had to get your opinion because I think this is actually kind of funny because maybe it was a year or two ago, you wrote an article that had one of the ether rocks on there. And I think, ironically, someone posted that onto bitcoin, and it actually sold for a lot of bitcoin. So what is your opinion on nfts, on chain, on bitcoin? Do you think that's good? Bad? It's a lot of controversy on Twitter about it.
01:10:28.652 - 01:11:02.890, Speaker A: Well, it's funny, in my first article where I specifically talked about bitcoin's fee market, it was like two years ago. And I mentioned that in the past there were these kind of fadish periods where you'd use opern to do arbitrary things, you'd link other blockchains to bitcoin, whatever the case may be. And that kind of briefly subsided. And I was like, in the future, something like that. Could easily come back. There could be other uses for block space that are unforeseen now, but they come in the future. And out of nowhere this year, everyone's now sticking jpegs into the bitcoin blockchain.
01:11:02.890 - 01:11:48.030, Speaker A: And that's an example where if there's block space and you have this super immutable ledger and it's super cheap to put something in there, and you can, people will. It's almost like everyone's kind of working together, like build this monument and while the cement is still wet, people are kind of like putting their hand print in it or doing graffiti on it. And there's clearly a mix of things. I mean, on one hand, I think know we've seen kind of waves of NFT adoption and it goes away, right? So this is like the new thing to play with. It's kind of causing a lot of ruckus. I think there's a chance we look back a couple of years from now and it's less interesting. On the other hand, there are some interesting applications, for example, dispersing information that is maybe censored in certain countries.
01:11:48.030 - 01:12:34.962, Speaker A: People have put, for example, Tinyman square images on bitcoin now, right? So that anyone that wants to run a full bitcoin node that's technically accessible to them now. And people even put things like how to build a ghost gun, which is relevant to certain regimes where you're living in authoritarian area, and they kind of ban that thing, and there's kind of local militias that want to arm themselves. And obviously I'm not advocating violence, but basically there is ways to. Now, it's just like immutable information that's out there. It's very hard to ever change the fact that it's out there. And so I can see why that block space is interesting in that regard. In addition, a lot of NFTs are not actually storing the image on chain.
01:12:34.962 - 01:13:14.620, Speaker A: It's almost like a receipt that points to an external, distributed way of holding the image. And so for some NFT enthusiasts, having the actual image on chain makes it more interesting and more scarce from their perspective. So I don't really have a strong view. I think that if we get to a point where there's just more people that want to use bitcoin for monetary purposes, which again, can really just include wanting to take some into self custody every month, right. That can eventually have enough fee pressure to push out some of these more frivolous use cases. But if there's still enough demand for it, some people will maybe want to pay high fees for that. So I kind of neutral on that whole thing.
01:13:14.620 - 01:14:48.166, Speaker A: One of the concerns I took somewhat seriously is people point out that you could put illegal imagery into the blockchain, kind of like the worst type of illegal imagery, and then say, well, now it's legal to run a node because every node is now hosting the worst kind of illegal imagery. But my understanding is that's already on the chain, technically, and that's really only attack vector if media and regulators are smart enough to kind of coordinate around that and then actually pass legislation around that. So I think that's one of those things where that's kind of like one of those adversarial thinking type of things, but we'll see what happens. So I mostly have not been super interested in it, but I had to kind of focus on, okay, how exactly is this being done? What are the pros and cons, what's happening here? So for me, it's mostly a non issue. I've actually been more focused on a little bit what's happening over at Nostar, basically like decentralized social media, which I think is another example of something where the technology is interesting, and that's an example of something that's being used that does not have a token. And so you don't see a lot of broad crypto kind of enthusiasm for it because it's hard to make money off of it, but it's something that's actually working pretty well and solving interesting problems. And instead there's kind of so much attention around ordinals or regulatory issues when I think there's actually some pretty interesting technology being developed elsewhere? Yeah.
01:14:48.188 - 01:15:16.450, Speaker D: Do you think there's any legitimacy to the idea of maybe starting a decentralized social media app and then everyone on the application who used it, like, let's say the first 20,000 users, they get a majority of some token supply. If there is a necessity to have a token in order to decentralize the network, do you not find value in kind of that new model, know, tokenizing ownership and giving it to the people who actually use the platforms instead of just farming likes and retweets on Twitter?
01:15:17.270 - 01:15:52.346, Speaker A: So I think you can, and I think that can accelerate adoption for a period of time, but I think partially what you get from that is artificial adoption. Right. So one of the jokes kind of in the space is that there's more like web3 investors than web3 users. Right. And that's what you risk getting if you incentivize basically a product or service with a token that's been used in the past. Basically anything from airline miles to rewards cards to membership perks. Like if you have a membership to something, you save money on it.
01:15:52.346 - 01:16:33.850, Speaker A: There's different marketing things that can pull people in with financial incentives, and giving them some ownership is one of them, but it gets undermined if it turns out that the technology doesn't even need ownership. If you create unnecessary ownership for something and then give it to them, I think that's kind of a weak way of doing it. Example with noster is you have this kind of decentralized protocol. Nobody owns it. But the way that it incorporates quote unquote ownership is that if you want to run a relay. So the way it works is that not every user has to run a server, but there has to be a lot of people running servers, right? So not everybody has to, but you need a decent number of them out there. That's what keeps it decentralized.
01:16:33.850 - 01:17:08.242, Speaker A: And you can then choose which, they call them relays, but you can choose which relays, which servers you connect to in terms of publishing information, accessing information on that. They store the information. Some of them run for free. Other ones you pay and you pay with the lightning network, right? So that's an example of a distributed social network that makes use of the fact that digital native money exists. Bitcoin and lightning in this case. And there is a way for some users, power users, to monetize from it. You can also tip each other with sats over the lightning network.
01:17:08.242 - 01:17:41.146, Speaker A: And so basically, instead of farming likes, if you want, you can farm sats. Basically you can do different things like that. And I think that's potentially a more sustainable model because no one owns the protocol. It's just an open source protocol. Individuals can own individual relays and operate them. And so you're still having the monetary incentives without artificially creating a governance structure that then is now owned by early users that are mostly just owning the token rather than actually using the network.
01:17:41.258 - 01:18:27.038, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. You've already been super generous with your time. So I only have one more question, but I guess I just can't wrap my head around why would someone ever want to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin? Why would anyone ever want to buy a house with bitcoin? Or put down a down payment in bitcoin, considering. Well, maybe not down payment, because your thesis is the addressable market for bitcoin is just money, which is absolutely huge, and I agree with you, but why? Central banks today purposely induce inflation in order to stimulate economic activity to some degree. So why would anyone ever want to spend a bitcoin if it's ultimately disinflationary? And then, yeah, if you could just elaborate on your thesis there.
01:18:27.204 - 01:18:51.186, Speaker A: Well, so I think in the near term they won't. Most people won't. Right. So unless you need censorship, resistance, or you're in an environment where it's very expensive to operate, basically a lot of frictions in terms of payments, you won't. The only people that I think will long term is people who, over time, due to holding bitcoin and due to appreciation of bitcoin. And they don't want to go back to holding a lot of fiat. They eventually have so much bitcoin, they want to spend their bitcoin.
01:18:51.186 - 01:19:45.986, Speaker A: Right? So a lot of people that are spending bitcoin now are people that have been holding it for five years. I think in the future, the people that have kind of been holding it now for one, two, three years, when they've been holding it for 5678 years, and it's a much larger percentage of their net worth, I think an increasing number of them will want to spend it. In addition, you have things like micro payments. Like, I mean, Nostra is a good example if you want to tip each other these little tipping environments, or you want to pay a relay operator a dollar, it's hard to do that with something like credit cards. If you do a credit cards, you're now losing anonymity, right? So it's useful for pseudonymous online payments and things like that. In addition, when you're talking about global payments or global remittances, there's these pretty high fees on a lot of different types of payments. And you're prone to censorship.
01:19:45.986 - 01:20:41.990, Speaker A: You're prone to just not being basically all forms of ways that block your transaction going through or various rent seekers along the way. And so I don't think you're going to see a lot of bitcoin payment activity until bitcoin is much larger, much more widely held. And so I think it's a slow grind. But one thing to keep in mind is that everybody who accepts bitcoin strengthens the network because it increases the censorship resistance of bitcoin. Like, let's say there was a world where nobody actually accepted bitcoin as payment and is only available on, say, ten exchanges worldwide. And you could convert fiat to bitcoin, you could get your bitcoin, you could self custody your bitcoin, and nobody accepted the bitcoin for anything. It wouldn't be a very censorship resistant network, because if governments wanted to stop it, they would just go to those ten exchanges and say, okay, you're shut down or you need to KYC everybody XYZ.
01:20:41.990 - 01:21:48.078, Speaker A: Whereas if you have more and more marginal adoption around the world, basically different type, you know, atms, different types of small merchants accepting bitcoin ways to convert bitcoin into gift cards, right? And these days you can use gift cards for anything. In a lot of developing countries, you can convert bitcoin to like mobile time. So you're buying data with your bitcoin. There's a lot of portals like this, and especially in an environment where, again, imagine like a developing world context where if overall bad payment, infrastructure, inflationary currencies, I think this is like a way that you can leapfrog the current system and go right to the next system. I think a final point I'll make is that already more people in the world have smartphones than bank accounts. So bank accounts had a multicentury head start. And still in a given developing country, there's a sizable percentage of the population, and in some cases a majority of the population that does not have a bank account.
01:21:48.078 - 01:23:01.138, Speaker A: There's even things like, there's like weird situations you can find yourselves in where there's almost no way to get a bank account. Like, let's say you're a refugee, you leave a country, you go to another country, you don't have an id with you for whatever reason. And the bank's like, well, we can't open without an id. Well, how do I get an id? It's like, well, how do you prove of where you came from, what your birth is? It's like, well, if you can just get on boarded with a private key and a smartphone, now you're basically banked, right? And that also applies the reason a lot of people in developing countries are not banked, because they have like, say, $100. And the bank says, well, that's not worth our time, right? But if the whole process is automated, if you're talking about like a mobile app, that's more workable. So I think that in a first world developed market context where we have dollars, euros, yen, and for us, in many cases, these assets are like portfolio holdings or even cold storage holdings that we're planning to just hold for a number of years, there's very little reason to spend bitcoin, except for maybe niche circumstances, like again, paying noster relays or things like that. Little online micro payments perhaps.
01:23:01.138 - 01:23:18.070, Speaker A: But when you look at a global scale, and long term, I think that's where you're likely to see basically these alternative payment rails be developed for either people that want censorship, resistance, or that just find the technology to be better, more automated and more accessible than what they get in fiat markets.
01:23:18.150 - 01:24:00.774, Speaker D: Okay, so do you think obviously bitcoin started out pretty centralized, it was just Satoshi mining bitcoin, but it gradually decentralized over time, ownership became more widely distributed. Now, Ethereum is twice as young as bitcoin, and all the Dapps built on top of Ethereum and all these other l ones are three to ten times newer as well than bitcoin. Do you expect over the course of the next decade for some of these systems to truly decentralize? Because I do think it's fair to say that decentralization is a core ethos of Ethereum, but it's just trying to accomplish so much more that it has some constraints around node requirements that you can actually implement in order to truly decentralize it as much as bitcoin.
01:24:00.822 - 01:25:11.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there are two main headwinds against decentralization from most of these other protocols compared to bitcoin. One would be, as you pointed out and as I mentioned earlier in the talk, basically node size, right? And especially in terms of bandwidth requirements, not just storage, but bandwidth requirements is in practice generally the harder limitation. Like already, for example, you can't run an Ethereum node over Tor, but you can do with bitcoin, and so already you're losing privacy aspects with that in. So if you have blockchains and Ethereum is know you can go further than that to ones like Solana, right, it's even bigger node requirements. So basically the more you try to do in terms of throughput or complexity on the base layer, the harder it is to run a node. And if a node is getting bigger faster than technology is improving, like for storage and bandwidth, then you're going to get more and more centralization, whereas if you're growing slower than the rate of technology bandwidth and storage, then you have the option or at least potentially get more decentralized over time. And generally I see most types of node requirements growing pretty quickly, which is very concerning for their decentralization.
01:25:11.950 - 01:25:44.294, Speaker A: Number two is the kind of the proof of stake versus proof of work challenge, which is in proof of work, the miners have a lot of costs and so they end up distributing their coins over time. Even if they try to hoddle them, they usually end up running into some bear market that breaks them and they kind of spill their coins out into the market. And so you don't really have a lot of consolidation of power there. I mean, the biggest bitcoin miner is like 5% of the network. And mining pools have no switching costs. So miners can just. They're noncustodial.
01:25:44.294 - 01:26:38.966, Speaker A: Miners can just, if they're directing at one pool, that's being a problem. They can just instantly direct at another pool. So it's really the minor centralization that we would be concerned about. And that's kind of inherently distributive. Whereas the challenge of proof of stake is that you can hold coins, you can stake your coins, and you get more coins, and there's virtually no cost of capital for doing that. And so you can just keep accumulating coins, and you kind of have this consolidation that can happen over time if certain things play out in certain directions. So the combination of challenges in running a node, as well as kind of a lack of distribution mechanism, as well as your stake in the network being tied to your ability to censor the network, I think is pretty problematic overall, as well as if your blockchain is competing with others on utility.
01:26:38.966 - 01:27:37.150, Speaker A: So if its primary thing is not its own sake, but is to provide some other service, like if you're trying to be the best stablecoin transfer mechanism, right, you're now competing with every other smart contract blockchain in terms of doing that, which creates downward free pressure. And so it kind of gives you an incentive to innovate in such a way that you're more willing to sacrifice decentralization to be cheaper and more efficient or risk stagnation. And so I think that that's another kind of pressure that's out there. And so a lot of these things are going to perpetually have roadmaps, and a roadmap is almost inherently decentralized. It's basically a small number of people telling you the future direction of how this is going to go. Whereas if you have a protocol, like a true kind of decentralized protocol, it's a different story. So I do think there are a lot of challenges with kind of the prospects for a lot of these other blockchains decentralizing over time.
01:27:37.220 - 01:27:49.726, Speaker D: Awesome. Yeah, it's always fun to hear your thoughts on this kind of stuff. We definitely disagree in a lot of places, but I love getting your perspective. It's very sobering. So thank you so much for coming on. Do you want to share with the audience where they can find you?
01:27:49.748 - 01:28:02.450, Speaker A: To learn more, I'm at lindalden.com. I'm also active on Twitter at people can find me there and I'm always happy to have these types of discussions. I think everybody learns when we have these types of discussions or debates.
01:28:02.530 - 01:28:02.822, Speaker D: Awesome.
01:28:02.876 - 01:28:03.094, Speaker A: Great.
01:28:03.132 - 01:28:07.510, Speaker D: Well, I will be sure to reach out in like six to twelve months to get you on again. Thanks again, Lyn.
