00:00:00.250 - 00:00:21.840, Speaker A: Service providers are desperately needed to scale dows and efficiently get stuff done. It is an absolute mess. Like, if you're really involved in these dows on the back end, like it is a shit show. It may not appear it in the discords, the telegrams, honestly, it probably does there, but it's even worse behind the scenes. We really do think, like, professional service providers need to step in, help get things done. There's so many pain points.
00:00:24.210 - 00:00:24.998, Speaker B: What's up, everyone?
00:00:25.044 - 00:00:25.254, Speaker A: One.
00:00:25.292 - 00:00:27.638, Speaker B: Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research.
00:00:27.724 - 00:00:29.138, Speaker A: If you're listening to this podcast, there's.
00:00:29.154 - 00:00:47.874, Speaker B: A good chance that, like Dan and I, you believe the future of finance is on the blockchain. And we're excited that London is becoming a global hub for blockchain innovation and institutional adoption of digital assets. That's why we're pumped to host the 2024 Digital Asset Summit in London this March. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. Later in this episode, we'll tell you how you can save 20% off on your ticket.
00:00:47.922 - 00:00:48.550, Speaker A: What's up, everyone?
00:00:48.620 - 00:01:13.970, Speaker B: Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Before we dive into today's episode, a quick word from our sponsor, Hexons, the most hardcore security team in web3.

00:01:14.040 - 00:01:44.286, Speaker A: Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We have an awesome analyst interview lined up for you guys today. But before we dive into it, I want to shout out blockworksresearch.com. You can use Zero xresearch ten to get 10% off your quarterly or annual subscription, so be sure to check that out. We'll drop a link to the show note or in the show notes so you guys can navigate to it that way. Today is November 3 and we are joined by pibbles effort and Ren. I should actually say I because Dan was unable to make it.
00:01:44.286 - 00:01:54.114, Speaker A: Analysts have lives too, so he decided to take a little vacation. Much needed. But pibbles, do you want to take over the movers and losers of the week?
00:01:54.232 - 00:02:29.878, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll jump right into this. Top winners of the week, obviously soul with the breakfain conference, but then you also saw DFI 1.0 kind of ripping. And this is mainly due to just how illiquid the perps are. Like comp and Abe and sushi just trade like literal meme coins on perps. Probably some DWF shenanigans going on there. Biggest losers weren't necessarily losers, but I would say the two laggards of the week are usually maker and ETH.
00:02:29.878 - 00:03:01.190, Speaker C: And you can just see that BTC ETH ratio just going, or the ETH BTC ratio going lower and lower. Rates are actually starting to go down a little bit as of today. So I don't know, Maker was like really great as a play in the bear market, but if things are turning around, we're kind of seeing the inverse happen. Another one I want to flag is ARB had like a really nice short lived pump. And I guess this will kind of go into the governance section if you want to talk a little about the ARB staking proposal.
00:03:02.010 - 00:03:14.970, Speaker A: Yeah. Real quick on the maker front, I'm curious if you guys have any opinions. Do you think it kind of continues to outperform as people go risk on? Because fundamentally speaking, it's at all time highs, but feel like people don't really care about fundamentals in a bull market?
00:03:15.040 - 00:04:06.410, Speaker D: I guess I think part of that depends on sort of like the term duration of all of their reward asset investments. I don't know how long those are, but I know most of their us treasury investments are pretty short term. If I'm not wrong, they have to be shorter than six months, whereas for their real world asset investments, perhaps those are locked in for a longer period of time, say two to three years. So it's probably less sensitive to interest rate changes such as like the dovish pause that we saw earlier this week. But I think going to a bull market, I don't think rates come down that quickly. Fundamentally, makers should still be making a buttload of money. But yeah, it probably underperforms like BTC Eve and say maybe Solana in the next bull, but it won't underperform too much, in my opinion.
00:04:07.390 - 00:04:56.630, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the rolled asset narrative obviously kind of created like a fundamental floor, and you saw like, what, 500, $600 kept getting defended, and maker really outperformed for most of Q one and Q two. And I think makers pretty much probably has the lowest correlation to the rest of the crypto market at large at this point because of how grounded it is in the real world treasury yields. But I think it's probably going to underperform until you start seeing Spark protocol do its airdrop. And maybe you see other protocols that are building around like this maker endgame. If you start seeing other airdrops to other protocols that are leveraging Makerdow's liquidity, that's when I think you're going to start seeing it outperform again. When there's that narrative is back here and now it's kind of like a hyper speculative bull market. That's where I think could really start ripping.
00:04:56.630 - 00:05:12.734, Speaker E: I think the chart still looks great. Like TA is mostly, what, astrology for men, but take it with a grain of salt. But I still think chart looks pretty decent once you see Spark protocol. I think dude's airdrops whenever you see maker outperform again, I could also see.
00:05:12.772 - 00:05:37.880, Speaker A: The whole, I guess, just maker Endgame rune. Like brought up the idea of forking the Solana code, like, with how good Solana has been performing. I could see that being a huge tailwind in terms of momentum, but I'm putting you guys on the spot here. But there was a little debacle with the PSM and the amount of USDC in there, and there was some stuff that needed to be done. Is anyone caught up to speed on that and able to explain what happened there?
00:05:38.190 - 00:06:24.274, Speaker D: Yeah, so basically the PSM has a minimum balance of USDC, but in fact it's PSM and the 2G uni poos. And there's been like a lot of withdrawals. And over the weekend, basically, once it goes below that 300 million threshold, one individual is meant to reach out to basically the custodian in charge of sort of like the Coinbase custody account and say, hey, USCC is running low in the PSM. I'm going to need you to withdraw from our Coinbase custody reward asset account. And to top up the. But like, it's one guy commenting on the form and it also relies on the custodian shrm to also go look at the form. And I think he reached out on Sunday and I think Sunday, and I guess they don't work weekend.
00:06:24.274 - 00:06:56.660, Speaker D: So by the time the custodian initiated the transaction to top it up by 250,000,000 USDC, the total amount of USDC in the PSM and the 2g uni pools had dropped I think, below 100 million USDC. If I'm not wrong, which is pretty dangerously low, I don't think there's any solvency risks to die. It's just like a temporary lack of one to one liquidity to swap between USDC and DAi. But the process is definitely outdated for sure.
00:06:57.750 - 00:07:15.782, Speaker A: And if I understand correctly, the main risk would be the PSM getting drained and then people needing to buy back die on the market, similar to what happened in 2020, and then die deepgs to the upside, and it doesn't get our back. So then paying back the debt is more expensive. Is that like, the primary concern here?
00:07:15.916 - 00:07:17.910, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that'd be the primary concern.
00:07:18.410 - 00:07:21.918, Speaker A: Okay, got it. Okay, awesome. Well, I appreciate that, Ren.
00:07:21.954 - 00:07:22.250, Speaker E: Thanks.

Without further ado, let's get back to today's episode.
00:08:09.634 - 00:08:43.310, Speaker A: Over to some governance updates. Back to talking about arbitrum staking. I know we talked about this last week, but I did kind of change my view on this. Just as a little recap, there is a proposal live to activate staking of ARB, and it would be anywhere from 100 to 175,000,000 of incentives over the next twelve months for people who lock their tokens from anywhere from a couple of weeks to a year, I believe it is. I was originally really against this, but at the same time I thought about it. I don't think it's perfect, but at the same time, the ARB token needs utility. It'd be a nice supply thing for ARB.
00:08:43.310 - 00:09:11.678, Speaker A: At the same time that there's going to be some stip inflation with the 50 million ARB allocation to the different protocols over the next three months. And there's already like a billion tokens, over a billion tokens of ARB in users hands. So it's really just like a 10% inflation rate on the circulating supply effort. I know you and I were kind of originally on the side of I feel like this is dumb, but I've kind of changed my view and I'm like, all right, it's not perfect, but I think it's a good interim solution for now. What do you guys think?
00:09:11.844 - 00:09:40.710, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it makes things a lot more fair for public market participants in ARB because you have different funds who got in private rounds and obviously they're waiting for their cliff to end and then they can start investing. But in the meantime, the average public investor or airdrop recipient can sit there and get ahead of that curve a little bit. Not that it's like super material or anything, but I like the notion.
00:09:41.130 - 00:10:34.066, Speaker E: I think in conjunction with the steps that are being released, a good supply sink is always net bullish. I would obviously like. I know Kobe wrote this whole thread about how staking is not really staking if you're not really putting collateral at risk for anything. We had a whole internal debate about this as group, but I think it does create some artificial supply sync for ARP tokens for now, obviously, I'm sure there's going to be an additional real supply sync over time when it starts distributing some of the sequencer revenue to ARP stakers. So I don't think it's like a material difference, but it's not a bad look. To again create a supply tank and also distribute additional ARB and give inflation is essentially a tax on non stakers at this point. So it is a good way for retail holders that want to put up that capital to get additional ownership in the protocol.
00:10:34.258 - 00:10:35.602, Speaker A: Yes, agreed.
00:10:35.746 - 00:10:36.822, Speaker B: I think that vote too.
00:10:36.876 - 00:11:12.402, Speaker A: It's Friday right now, so we're recording. Usually we record on Monday, so this will come out Wednesday. So that vote will have concluded. But right now the option to fund it with 175,000,000 ARB is winning, which is the highest allocation possible. But be sure to check snapshot to stay up to date on that one. We can probably link to that in the description so you can find it easily. But onto the next one we've got ribbon to Avo token migration rebrand I guess I'm not really sure exactly the mechanics, but essentially ribbon rebranded to AVo and it needs a new governance token, and it's supposed to launch no later than January 2024.
00:11:12.402 - 00:11:56.526, Speaker A: So I think this is a good one to flag early on and to pay close attention to basically 25% of revenue from the options vaults. And the exchange will go to an insurance fund, and then the other 75% will go to covering operating expenses for the developers until $5 million has accrued each year. And then after that, it kind of has the same exact mechanism as maker with the smart engine burn, so that it'll build up protocol and liquidity by buying AVO from the USDC pool and then therefore reduce the circulating supply. I really like this proposal. I think it's great. I just don't know how much revenue AVO actually makes. It could be a very long time before $5 million accrues.
00:11:56.526 - 00:12:06.610, Speaker A: Maybe one of you has a better idea on this, but nevertheless, I think the smart burn engine is a great mechanism and a good way to return value back to token holders.
00:12:07.270 - 00:12:47.806, Speaker D: I don't have a good idea of how much money Avo is making right now, but I feel like they've definitely been shipping. I think they've recently launched cross margin capability for AvO. They've obviously been sort of keeping track of pre launch futures for any large airdrops, for example. So that's his airdrop. You can trade that on the exchange. And in the previous month, they've integrated ribbon option vaults into AVo itself. So whenever the option vaults are selling the calls or the puts, that flow is being passed through AvO instead of what used to be sort of like this off chain RFQ type of mechanism that was manipulated slightly.
00:12:47.806 - 00:13:24.830, Speaker D: But then eventually they did manage to address that by integrating a paradigm. I think one key thing I think about in terms of able is will people still value it as like an options vaults sort of token or just the wider exchange? Because I have a feeling that option vaults don't do as well as they did as the previous bull run. I think that was a very, like, just retail had no clue what they were doing. They were just aping into it for some fancy APIs. Whereas this cycle, chances are you're a bit more sophisticated, chances are we learn a bit more from the past cycle and the vaults just don't see the same amount of TBL growth that they saw last cycle.
00:13:25.330 - 00:14:01.110, Speaker C: Yeah, I just pulled up Avo stats and it's looking like it's right under ten mil TbL, but 24 hours volume was like eleven mil. And then their biggest day they had was, I think last month it was like 40 mil, but it looks like it's averaging like probably 89 mil, 24 hours volume and USD inflows are on the up and up. It's still an expensive ass token, in my opinion, for what it is, but good for them for being ahead of the app specific roll up narrative.
00:14:01.530 - 00:14:11.782, Speaker E: So just this is my first time really hearing this polls. I didn't really do a deep dive, so kind of off the cuff. But this is options Vault revenue and their perps exchange revenue. Right? Just to clarify.
00:14:11.926 - 00:14:13.120, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right.
00:14:13.490 - 00:14:31.426, Speaker E: So right now, just pulled up token terminal. Shout token terminal. They have pretty good data. So their annualized revenue right now is $330,000. So $5 million. At current pace, you're not seeing $5 million for over a decade. Token holders will not wait that long.
00:14:31.426 - 00:15:16.130, Speaker E: We're way too impatient of a population. But you'd have to imagine I've seen a lot of good people talk highly of their perps exchange. Obviously we're still in the depths of a bear market, regardless of bitcoin and sole ripping. Like most crypto protocols aren't really seeing all time highs in terms of users and volume or what have you. I'd have to assume that revenue goes up staggeringly over the next cycle. Maybe you see $5 million in revenue in year one, and then that flips on that fee switch token holders into buying back ribbon or Avo Token and doing leveraging pol to create like a deeper moat of liquidity for a univ three or univ two pool. So I like this proposal.
00:15:16.130 - 00:15:30.550, Speaker E: Pretty bullish on the ribbon team. Overall. The token is probably a little overvalued today, to your point, Spence Pibs. But I like this idea. I like taking the smart burn engine protocol like thesis that makers doing with their own token.
00:15:30.890 - 00:15:54.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm with you. I'm for this proposal. Unfortunately, that value crew doesn't sound like it's coming anytime soon, but we can keep a close eye on it nonetheless. Onto another one. We got a uniswap proposal from Duwan Nam. Crazy name. But to delegate up to twelve and a half million uni from the treasury to underrepresentative delegates who have shown to be very active in value add.
00:15:54.542 - 00:16:07.426, Speaker A: Not a whole lot to say on this. Honestly, I think this is a fantastic idea. And I'm surprised more protocols don't do this. I feel like this is a great way of balancing delegation power amongst different people.
00:16:07.608 - 00:16:28.486, Speaker E: It's cool, but like, when fee switch for delegates, when do delegates start to get paid for their contribution to the protocol? It's not like it matters, let's be honest, right? Like Jesse Walden from various and a couple other whales will still decide ultimately what Uniswap governance does. It's mostly a farce today. Not to be pessimistic, I think it's a great idea. But will it actually change anything with uniswap governance? Probably not.
00:16:28.668 - 00:16:31.770, Speaker D: You'll be a public good and you'll be happy with that for life.
00:16:31.920 - 00:16:58.740, Speaker C: I'll take the opposite of that. I think the program to get active but underrepresented delegates to get more voting power could be the start of the turning stone of fixing uni governance. And dude with stable labs is like, he's really great, active in governance and a lot of things. So I'm excited to see this program kick off and see how we as a team can step in there and help out.
00:16:59.190 - 00:17:32.666, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. And also, we are uni delegates, so consider us if you're looking to delegate. And speaking of that, actually, we have a new vote live on the arbitrum snapshot, which is the arbitrum coalition vote. I guess like the TLDR is, it's three groups. There is blockworks research, us, and then so us, blockworks research, and then trail of bits and gauntlet. We just kind of think that service providers are desperately needed to scale dows and officially get stuff done. It is an absolute mess.
00:17:32.666 - 00:17:58.462, Speaker A: If you're really involved in these dows on the back end, it is a shit show. It may not appear it in the discords, the telegrams, honestly, it probably does there, but it's even worse behind the scenes. We really do think professional service providers need to step in, help get things done. There's so many pain points. Just for an example, we just reviewed over 100 steps proposals, made a spreadsheet so the community could track it. And there's no expectation of getting paid or anything. We've been there since day one.
00:17:58.462 - 00:18:38.834, Speaker A: You can go back, dig up some of the blockworks research threads when the Dow had been established, made some fund movement before we believed that the Dow could actually vote on those things. They did it kind of, I guess, before they should have. And we kind of rectified that situation. And, yeah, I'm kind of rambling at this point, but basically what I'm saying is I think that we definitely need service providers to provide really high value services like auditing research, delegate education, and things of that sort. So definitely consider voting for that proposal. Yes. No comment on the forum, if you'd like, but we would love your support and happy to answer any questions if you have any.
00:18:38.834 - 00:18:41.538, Speaker A: Does anyone else on the team have something to add there?
00:18:41.704 - 00:19:36.494, Speaker D: Yeah, I would just come in to add and say, I think Arbitrum Dao is one of the most engaged and involved daos out there, to be honest. In the entirety of crypto, to be very honest, there's a lot of high quality proposals out there, there's a lot of involved delegates and a lot of active discussion on the forums. But sort of execution around the proposals is always a problem, especially given how many different stakeholders there are involved. Right. There's a very long process from going to proposal to actually boarding on it and then to actually implementing it and just having someone there to facilitate all of that, whether that's risk assessment, research, coordination, creating objective voting frameworks. For example, in the arbitrage SIP proposal, I'm sure every delegate tried to create their own framework for the 100 plus SIP proposals. Or maybe you didn't.
00:19:36.494 - 00:19:43.474, Speaker D: And I wouldn't be too surprised if over all of the delegates and stakeholders more than, say, 2000, 3000 man hours was lost.
00:19:43.522 - 00:19:43.830, Speaker E: Right.
00:19:43.900 - 00:20:25.262, Speaker D: And so our job is to basically come in here and make that a lot more efficient for everyone. But I wanted to just emphasize that what we're doing is just providing objective frameworks and research. The albatum Coalition won't be like the be all and say all. We're not suddenly going to become the voice of the Dow. We're just helping provide tools to basically speed up all of the governance process. But every delegate and every token holder will still be able to maintain their independent voting power and basically come to their own decisions independently of us. We are just providing frameworks so that you make a more informed decision that probably benefits the Dow more as a whole and results in a more effective allocation of resources in the long term.
00:20:25.326 - 00:21:33.434, Speaker E: And just to add to that, because other dows are also going through this exact same similar idea, or where you have subject matter experts that are SMEs in their certain vertical, how do you onboard them? How do you actually make sure that they're working on behalf of the Dow and some people that are against this concept because they believe, like Dao is supposed to be inherently decentralized, you shouldn't have professional, centralized entities that are, I don't want to say running the show, but kind of making decisions on behalf of the larger community, I think what's important is this idea of optimistic governance. Let these SMEs do what they have to do. If you don't feel like as a Dow that your voice is being heard, you always have the option to remove and replace that service provider. As long as we don't cross that threshold, that we're stopping the ability for the DAO as a whole to veto, remove, replace, pull funds, what have you from a service provider. I think this is what the future of Dow governance looks like, at least for the foreseeable future, until we get to a point where we have the tools, AI and capabilities to actually do true decentralized coordination and make effective decisions like capital allocation, what have you. We're just. Fact of the matter is we're not there yet.
00:21:33.434 - 00:21:44.890, Speaker E: And just like l two Z training wheels with centralized sequencers, I would argue Dows need training wheels, which is like this decentralized group of service providers that really work on behalf of the Dow.
00:21:45.050 - 00:22:11.174, Speaker A: Yeah, you guys killed that. I definitely botched it in comparison to you guys, but I think that's very well said. And this is like a very fluid body. It's supposed to aid the Dow. And we're going to learn so much through this experience that hopefully we can bring to other dows and maybe other people can take this framework as well and apply it to their own dao. So very excited to see what comes out of it and hoping it gets passed. So definitely be sure to vote for that one, but don't want to take up too much time on that.
00:22:11.174 - 00:22:15.400, Speaker A: Let's head over to the hot seat. Cool throne. Ren, do you want to kick it off?
00:22:15.930 - 00:22:36.030, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. I got Coinbase in the hot seat this week. I wouldn't say it's like too much of a hot seat. It's probably like in between hot seat and cruise zone. So Coinbase announced their Q three earnings aftermarket yesterday. It was pretty much average, like as expected. I don't think anything surprised anyone that much.
00:22:36.030 - 00:23:07.634, Speaker D: Transaction revenue was down 12% quarter on quarter on the back of trading volume being down 17% quarter on quarter. So transaction revenue came in at 289,000,000. Institutional transaction revenue was down 18% quarter on quarter. Basically everything like trading and volume related was down a decently significant amount. However, subscription and services revenue was down a lot less. There were a lot of things that were, like, relatively down. For example, interest income, blockchain rewards, custodial fee revenue.
00:23:07.634 - 00:23:37.790, Speaker D: But one sort of outlier, there was other subscription and service revenue was up 10% quarter on quarter. And that was driven by higher Coinbase one revenue. Coinbase one is sort of Coinbase's sort of vip subscription service. You get lower trading fees, you get a bunch of subscriptions. I think there's like a lifestyle product subscription mix in there somewhere. And also growth in their prime financing product. And this is actually the first time in Coinbase's history that non commission revenues have exceeded commission based revenues.
00:23:37.790 - 00:24:06.378, Speaker D: Right. So obviously Coinbase is sort of milking its retail user base for whatever spread they're willing to pay. If I'm not wrong, it's something pretty ridiculous. It's like 1.5 percentage points, not basis points of today. So they're making a lot of transaction revenue of retail users, but that's not going to be the case forever, right? Stockbroker just had their moment where commissions went from say like $4.99 to a trade on a trade to $0.
00:24:06.378 - 00:24:39.362, Speaker D: And all it took was Bobin to make that first move. And every single other stock brokerage follows suit. I think something similar happens to Coinbase sooner or later, or crypto as a whole, to be honest. So it's quite encouraging seeing that Coinbase is sort of solidifying or strengthening their subscription and services revenue. And I think they know that that's probably the path that they're going to have to take. And then there's a bunch of other growth drivers too, for Coinbase over the next few years. USDC, where they had their announcement that they sort of had like a new joint partnership with Circle earlier in August.
00:24:39.362 - 00:24:49.640, Speaker D: I want to say, obviously they have their staking business and now with base their altitude, I'll stop there and I'll let other people sort of comment on how their earnings went.
00:24:50.570 - 00:25:21.326, Speaker A: The main thing that stuck out to me was interest income being down. I know USDC market cap has been down only, but that was just surprising to me after the partnership with Circle. So I'd like to know more about that. Not saying you do off the top of your head, Ren, but I would be intrigued. And I also saw some people talking about on Twitter how they raised retail fees from like one and a half percent to two and a half percent, effective for the next quarter and for the foreseeable future. So I think I have that right. But correct me if I'm wrong, but that was also surprising.
00:25:21.326 - 00:25:55.534, Speaker A: But I think you should see an uptick in trading fee revenue assuming flat volume, if that is the case. I mean, I don't think retail goes to Coinbase really caring about what fee they pay, to be quite honest. So I think it's a good move for now, a nice little band aid, but yeah, I don't know, it's just funny. Everyone's talking about Coinbase now on crypto Twitter. You'd honestly think, based on the amount of open interest on call options, that all of crypto Twitter has the ability to pretty much buy all the shares of Coinbase if they were exercised. But, yeah, nevertheless, effort. I'm sure you've got some thoughts here.
00:25:55.732 - 00:26:35.206, Speaker E: Yeah, I think I could be wrong about the swap fee or their effective fee on retail. So there's two different ways you can trade on Coinbase. There's Coinbase advanced and there's like the normal swap fee, I'm sorry, their normal swap interface, like the retail trade option. So I think what happens is if more users use advanced trade, which has a lower fee take rate, that's where you see that effective rate change. I don't think they actually increase their rates on customers. I could be wrong though, but I think it's just based on the mix of user, based on how they're swapping. The next thing I was going to say is, obviously, I know a lot of people make fun of adjusted EBITDA.
00:26:35.206 - 00:27:36.622, Speaker E: Overall, their net loss was the lowest it's been over the past year. Plus their just EBITDA was still positive for the quarter. And the fact of the matter is, we saw the lowest volatility in q two and q three that we've seen throughout the past four or five ish years in crypto. They barely had to really touch their cash on hand. They're in a really good spot if you believe that the next cycle is coming, if you think 2024 and 2025 is going to be better than 2022 and 2023, I'd have to imagine that they turn like an actual profit in the upcoming cycle and not just like adjusted EBITDA. One thing I thought was also interesting to note is that they plan on increasing their marketing spend in q four compared to q three and q two, and I believe q one as well. And I wonder if that's because they're trying to time the upcoming full cycle by marketing more in q four and then potentially the major run up of the next cycle starting in sometime q one, q two of 2024.
00:27:36.622 - 00:28:12.110, Speaker E: So I think they're in a good spot unless the bottom falls out and we actually reach a lower low, which I don't think is going to happen. Knock on wood. Who knows? But unless you see complete lack of volatility over the foreseeable future, Coinbase is kind of operating neutral territory right now, and there's only Bullish catalyst. I think, on the horizon. You can argue that the custody fees could drop in the events of a bitcoin spot ETF. That is very true, but I think custodial fees are like less than 10% of their overall revenue and obviously like regulatory clarity. I think it's going to be bullish.
00:28:12.110 - 00:28:48.506, Speaker E: I would love for them to potentially become a bank of source because they kind of are like a neo bank. So there's ways that they can generate additional revenue through rehydpothation eventually, if we have the proper regulatory framework to do that. I think overall Coinbase is like the first real fintech company we've ever seen. They're building their entire backend based on these new financial rails. Other fintech companies like PayPal, Square, what have you, they aren't really fintech. They're really just nice Gui's on top, slapped on top of the old financial rails. If you're bullish crypto and bullish like this, decentralized public networks, I don't know how you aren't bullish.
00:28:48.558 - 00:28:49.442, Speaker A: Coinbase.
00:28:49.586 - 00:28:56.822, Speaker E: My personal take, we'll see if it ends up playing out well. So far it has played out well for me personally over this year.
00:28:56.956 - 00:29:31.218, Speaker A: I actually checked in on the perps volume as well the other day, just looking at past 24 hours volume because that just launched like two weeks ago and they had two bill in 24 hours volume. So I mean, global that day was probably around 150,000,000,000. So that's not that much. But I do think people are underestimating the pricing power of Coinbase on their perps offering. I think they're going to be able to charge higher fees and still capture market share because of the fact that it's so well capitalized and transparent and people know really who the counterparty is. I would expect that market share to climb up to 10% by the end.
00:29:31.224 - 00:29:33.540, Speaker C: Of next year, but we'll see.
00:29:33.910 - 00:30:02.954, Speaker D: Yeah. I also chime in here to add that I think there's like three main growth drivers for Coinbase over the next few years. The first is international expansion. I think binance has been completely getting pummeled over the past year, just getting shut down in sort of territory after territory. So the international growth is really important there. The second thing is the derivatives and the US futures expansion. Like for example, we saw right in the last week, CME became the largest bitcoin futures exchange.
00:30:02.954 - 00:30:30.142, Speaker D: And I think that demand from institutions is definitely there to trade on a relatively safe venue. I think at one point CME had 3.5 billion in open interest versus finance, which had 3.8 billion in open interest. So the gap isn't that far. And Coinbase just allowed or just opened up us futures in several key markets, even in New York, which has really strict regulations when it comes to digital asset exchanges. And the last one is USDC.
00:30:30.142 - 00:31:09.326, Speaker D: USDC supply has gone down even more in the past few weeks. I think just in the past month it's gone down from like 26 billion to 24.5 billion. I don't know where the bottom is, I think the only saving grace for USDC is sort of institutional adoption in the sense of, for example, very web two or chat by companies using USDC, for example, SAP using USDC for sort of like cross border payments. I think that's probably going to be one of the larger growth drivers for USDC supply and sort of interest income there. But yeah, I think the narrative is the same and it does feel like Coinbase is becoming a very consensus trade on CG.
00:31:09.518 - 00:31:14.660, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see how it pans out. I know our livelihoods depend on it.
00:31:15.270 - 00:31:45.706, Speaker B: All right, zero x research listeners, we're calling on you to join us for the premier institutional Crypto conference in Europe's crypto capital, London this March 2024. You're going to get to hear exclusive insights from industry trailblazers on things like leveraging d five protocols for institutional yield, tokenizing real world assets with instant settlement, navigating the evolving global regulatory landscape, integrating digital assets into banking and payments, or crafting institutional investment mandates with digital assets as the key focus. We'll also be featuring some big keynote.
00:31:45.738 - 00:31:50.926, Speaker A: Speakers, including Melvin Dang, the CEO at QCP Capital, Mark Yusco, the CEO and.
00:31:50.948 - 00:32:06.590, Speaker B: Managing partner of Morgan Creek Capital, and Stani Kluchin, the founder and CEO of Ave Companies. This is not an event you're going to want to miss.

00:32:09.246 - 00:32:10.258, Speaker B: And be sure to hit up Dan.
00:32:10.274 - 00:32:13.270, Speaker A: And I for a beer pibbles. Who you got in the hot seat of cool throne?
00:32:13.610 - 00:32:50.190, Speaker C: Yeah, so I've got Prisma finance. All my homies hate Prisma. So a lot of people were farming this for the past two months. It's the convex founders. They came out and just forked liquidy. But they claim it's innovation because you can vote lock Prisma tokens to allocate rewards to gauges and different liquid staked eth collateral. So they launched the token two days ago and all the people who were farming points still haven't received their tokens.
00:32:50.190 - 00:33:50.486, Speaker C: Instead, they instantly turned on Prisma rewards for anyone who wanted to come deposit into the farm. As a result, Justin's son hopped in and threw like 110 mil in there, minted like 60 mil of MK USD stablecoin and he's just been like Insta dumping his Prisma rewards. And early supporters haven't gotten their airdrop yet. And the Prisma rewards like the APIs are really high across the board, but the rewards are locked for I think like 24 months or something. But you can take a 50% haircut if you want to instabst those and dump those. So I've seen obviously Justin sun is nuking the token and then DCF's in there as well. Also nuking the and like all the people who supported it and really helped pump up the numbers in the early days, they are just kind of really getting screwed here.
00:33:50.486 - 00:34:11.070, Speaker C: So this is the second time a points program has treated me really wrong. First one being etherfi when the points ended up being useless. Like you can get like a t shirt or something with those. So I'm pretty much like team. I hate points. I hate them so much. It's the worst thing to ever happen to defi.
00:34:11.070 - 00:34:27.026, Speaker C: Another thing I want to flag about Prisma is if people can just keep nuking their Prisma rewards, then the yields are going to go down a lot, which might incentivize people to just get.
00:34:27.048 - 00:34:28.158, Speaker D: The hell out of Prisma.
00:34:28.174 - 00:34:57.610, Speaker C: And then MK USD can start deepgging and it could end up just like go did. And I think we might see that speed run because first of all, there's no demand for something like this. We don't need ten liquidity forks all doing the same thing. So it's going to be really fun to watch how this goes on. I mean, they have 300 mil tvl right now and it's mainly just like the DFI cartel and the token is just down tremendously.
00:34:58.030 - 00:35:16.210, Speaker A: You got duped. That is absolute shit. I didn't realize the extent of the situation. That is crazy. I agree with you screw point systems. I love the salon, like all the builders over there, but all of them are embracing this point system and there's no surprise as to why they are. They have to promise you nothing.
00:35:16.210 - 00:35:22.420, Speaker A: They're just giving you imaginary points on the screen, not telling you what it's worth. So I am very much in camp. Screw points.
00:35:22.790 - 00:36:39.290, Speaker D: Yeah, just one last point. I think when I checked fisbal on coin gecko, the market cap was like 5 million while the FDB was like 3 billion. I think that's just so disgusting. And another thing that I think a lot of people are figuring out for these sort of eFAc stablecoins or sort of like protocol specific stablecoins are that you need some reason for there to be intrinsic demand for the stable coin. If there's no intrinsic demand for the stablecoin, then it's just not very sustainable. You have defects to the downside, or you have people mass redeeming at once, or you sort of have these death spirals without that intrinsic demand. That's why I think overall, all of these liquidity forks or EFAC stablecoins are hard to sustain, to be honest, just because there's no intrinsic, quote unquote real yield that isn't just generated from printing native governance tokens, or at least, for example, like Ethina, I think that's one sort of eFAC stablecoin that will perform relatively well in terms of market cap growth just because there's sort of like inherent yield being generated from both the underlying staking of eTH, but also from the short per position that they use the delta hedge, because that's like, quote unquote real yield that's being generated from somewhere.
00:36:39.290 - 00:36:45.680, Speaker D: Maybe it's not sustainable, maybe it's not scalable, but at least the real is quote unquote real, if that makes sense.
00:36:46.050 - 00:36:57.390, Speaker A: All good points. I agree. I mean, you need to have a reason to hold a stable coin. You're not just going to buy it just to hold it for fun, ever. Here, you got the hot seat or cold threaten.
00:36:57.990 - 00:37:23.190, Speaker E: Yeah, we'll start off another hot seat. So I have osmosis and like, the overall Cosmos stack on the hot seat today. A surprising company for me, I guess. So osmosis went down. Down is probably not the right term, but pretty much got ddos twice this week. So Celestia's airdrop happened on Tuesday. Probably the largest airdrop that's been anticipated for probably this entire cycle.
00:37:23.190 - 00:37:58.790, Speaker E: I'd argue, like, celestia is supposed to be the next kingmaker and potentially compete with theorem in terms of the data as a data availability solution. So it was like this big planned airdrop. They're leveraging the Cosmos stack to build Celestia. So it's supposed to be like a big win for the Cosmos ecosystem. People got airdropped from l two ecosystems. Obviously, main net, obviously Cosmos users also got airdropped. So it was supposed to be like this really grand event, I thought was going to bring in a lot of trade volume for osmosis, a lot of liquidity, what have you, a lot of Ethereum users to come on and trade on osmosis because that's where TIA was initially going to be launching.
00:37:58.790 - 00:38:27.034, Speaker E: And what ended up happening was because so much volume happened on osmosis, it ended up becoming unusable. So I got airdropped, TIA, I tried to ibc it over to osmosis to start trading or selling it or even providing liquidity within the first hour. That was my game plan. I wasn't able to. It took me over 2 hours to actually ibc my tia over. By that time, it really wasn't worth it to lp in my opinion. And I think just the amount of usage, and it wasn't even that much usage.
00:38:27.034 - 00:39:23.490, Speaker E: Like to call space spade, right? If you look at DFI llama, I think the day that TIa airdropped, osmosis got more volume than orca on Salana, but wasn't the top ten decks by 24 hours, volume and osmosis still went down. And to add insult to injury, in addition, there was a random pump on osmosis, token on finance and Coinbase. So osmosis pumped like 100% on Coinbase and finance yesterday, I believe on Thursday, November 2. And there was about a five minute lag between the pump on decentralized exchanges and on osmosis, its own decks. And within that five minute period, I guess arbitrage bots tried to DDoS the network to try to close that arbitrage. It made osmosis completely unusable. Arbitrage bots were bidding up Osmo to try to close the ArP and nobody could sell.
00:39:23.490 - 00:40:43.290, Speaker E: And I think because of correlation bots that are looking at the correlation between other cosmos chains, because osmosis was getting bid up to close the ArP, other assets like Mars token, Axelar somolier were up like 20% to 25% chasing osmosis, which went up like 35% on osmosis decks, even though it was up like 100% on binance and Coinbase. And because of all these arbitrage bots, again, nobody could sell, nobody could transfer anything. The ecosystem, or, I'm sorry, the decks itself came completely unusable. And ultimately what this comes down to is there's a fundamental issue with the P to P and the MemP pool layer, with how it pretty much becomes like a priority gas auction. Every single bot just tries to DDoS network to be first in line to close the Arp. And my understanding is that just last night, after 6 hours, after all this went down, osmosis created like a patch for validators to create, like a mempool filter to filter out certain arbitrage bots and certain addresses that I think were causing a lot of these issues. But there's supposed to be like a network upgrade to include something called block SDK, which kind of creates like swim lanes within the mempool so you can actually start to partition out like top of block auctions versus bottom of block auctions, et cetera.
00:40:43.290 - 00:41:15.138, Speaker E: But long story short, this was supposed to be a really big week for osmosis and the wider cosmos ecosystem. We kind of fell flat on our face. The wider ecosystem has been talking about for a while how IBC has gotten better and overall abstraction of this multichain network, how osmosis and the wider Cosmos SDK was ready for big time and osmosis couldn't even get above like ten tpS. And it was just completely unusable. So unfortunately, this kind of fell on our face here. Wasn't a good look. Devs are working to build to fix this.
00:41:15.138 - 00:41:51.326, Speaker E: I'm even hearing of a rumor that there's an upcoming new client for Comet BFT, which is the consensus mechanism that's built on top of Cosmos SDK or the Cosmos SDK is built on top of, that's going to kind of mimic fire dancer from Salana. So it's going to leverage turbine, it's going to leverage gulp stream and kind of fix a lot of the p to p and mental issues that comet BFT currently has. So that's supposedly been in stealth mode this entire year. I think it's going live in the next few weeks at least on Testnet, I'm sure on Testnet. But yeah, I mean, overall, playing the cosmos and the entire Cosmos s to.
00:41:51.348 - 00:42:12.754, Speaker A: Get in the hot seat for this week. Damn. That was a very good recap of everything that happened. I did not realize the extent of the issues. And honestly, I just feel really bad for the Cosmos folks because I completely agree with you. I was excited for you guys to kind of have your time in the limelight. And it seems nothing can go right ever since that peg.
00:42:12.754 - 00:42:14.310, Speaker A: That's just how it feels.
00:42:14.810 - 00:42:38.202, Speaker E: Funny story. There's actually a rumor going on right now internally in the cosmos chats that this exact mempool issue is what led to the UsTDpeg that somebody purposely pulled the liquidity from curve. I think. Correct me if I'm wrong. Right. Somebody pulled liquidity from curve and like the four. Yeah, I guess one of the ust main pools on curve.
00:42:38.202 - 00:43:06.466, Speaker E: And then that's really when you start seeing UST DPEG. And typically you're supposed to try to. I guess the way that Luna worked right now is like escaping me, sadly. But I guess somebody also spammed the mempool on Luna at the same time and that this issue might have actually caused the DPEG of UST to the point where it couldn't be recoverable. So it's like a rumor going on internally. Don't know how factual that is, but really interesting nonetheless.
00:43:06.658 - 00:43:14.746, Speaker A: That is interesting. And also just to lay it out for the audience, effort capital did not actually claim atea airdrop. He's just using a hypothetical example because.
00:43:14.768 - 00:43:17.210, Speaker C: He is a us based investor.
00:43:18.510 - 00:43:23.280, Speaker A: Fibbles, I think you got a couple of cool throws. Why don't you just rattle them both off?
00:43:23.730 - 00:43:59.030, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's mainly just the Alt L ones. Salana avalanche and near all did super well the past two weeks while ETH was in the toilet. Not really in the toilet, it was just like floating on toilet water. Salana obviously had breakpoint this past week. There was a lot of really exciting things that got announced. Like first, my most exciting piece is just Jupiter. The leading Dex aggregator is airdropping like 40% of its Jup token to users.
00:43:59.030 - 00:44:41.880, Speaker C: They also launched a perps product and they're going to do something. It's like JLP, it's kind of like GMX's model. And then drift is going to integrate that as well. We saw a couple of consumer facing apps that we're really showcasing at breakpoint and we also saw fire dancer on Testnet. And then of course he saw Soul's price just like absolutely ripping the past two weeks. It's like people just genuinely didn't know this stuff was going on. And it's probably because they don't subscribe to blockworks research because we talked about this last December and in like people just don't read, I guess.
00:44:41.880 - 00:45:13.166, Speaker C: So, yeah. Solana major cool. Like lots of great things happening there. One thing that will be interesting is whether it can sustain this pump. So that was it, getting repriced for all the fundamentals that have been there the whole time. But now we have the FTX estate which is constantly unstaking Sol and then sending little clips to centralized exchanges. So we have some pretty constant sell pressure over the coming months.
00:45:13.166 - 00:45:45.046, Speaker C: So that'll be interesting. And I think there is a cap of how much they can liquidate per week. I'd have to go find the docs for that. Also, piggybacking off of Solana I talked about near, I also just wrote a report about like two or three weeks ago. They have this Kaikai app and it's up only mode. There are so many users of kaikai, it's probably the most adopted app in crypto. And the best part is no one knows it's crypto.
00:45:45.046 - 00:46:01.210, Speaker C: So they have Nearcon coming up this next week. By the time this podcast is live near Con will have been going on expecting to see some more web two partnerships and some more stuff about AI integrations. So yeah, those are my two cool thrones.
00:46:01.370 - 00:46:52.926, Speaker D: Yeah, just a few points there. I think the Jupiter airdrop is fantastic. It's probably one of the leading liquidity and swap aggregators on Salana, and the fact that they're airdropping 40% of the community is pretty good. That's in comparison to, for example, Celestia who airdropped 6%, and Cliff, who also airdropped 6%. But however, I do want to emphasize that I don't think there's anything wrong with PiF and Celestia airdropping 6% to the community or specifically like just the dgens, their target audience that will basically help them win in the long term isn't the dgens. It's probably more so like infrastructure developers, modular blockchain devs, dapps themselves, blockchain ecosystem. So they really shouldn't be trying to target djens with airdrop anyway, as that's not their core user base.
00:46:52.926 - 00:47:40.320, Speaker D: I just wanted to put that out there. And another thing that Jupiter is doing is they're launching SUSD, which is this leverage. So staking back stablecoin off the top of my head, my knee jerk reaction was, I'm not sure whether that's such a great idea, especially considering on chain liquidity for so or sole stake derivatives isn't exactly that high at the moment. And margin fire has a lot of keto so deposits and they'll all be sharing that liquidity in the case of a mass liquidation. And we've seen how mass liquidations go on chain not so good, to be honest. So yeah, I'm kind of against that idea, but we'll see. For now, they're also integrating USDC's CCTP directly into Jupiter, so hopefully that'll do pretty well.
00:47:40.320 - 00:47:59.880, Speaker D: Another thing on year, I do think Kaikai is a pretty good app, especially in Asia. Asian people love their shopping rewards apps. They go absolutely crazy over them, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that growth continue to sustain in the coming months or years.
00:48:00.490 - 00:48:30.640, Speaker A: One other thing I would add on the soul front is the backpack exchange. I got to shout out my lassies, the mad lads. They're definitely doing some interesting stuff in terms of like an NFT project. They have the backpack and the X nfts and stuff like that. So I think that's going to be interesting to watch play out. And I'm very biased based on my bags, but that's like one of the few nfts that I didn't sell for pennies on the dollar. So I'm holding that one into the bull run and hoping for the best.
00:48:31.330 - 00:49:07.094, Speaker D: Yeah. Just one more thing on the fire dancer. I think the full fire dancer client is coming out in h two 2024 and there's sort of like an earlier, smaller, probably not as performant version of that coming out in h one 2024. But numbers that have been leaked or that were announced at breakpoint were 1 million TPS. I would think a lot of people saw that number and went like, holy shit. But I think Anna totally clarified that that isn't what it will look like in performance. That was like, in an isolated environment and didn't take into account the whole end to end network stack.
00:49:07.094 - 00:49:21.626, Speaker D: But it does feel like fire dice will be like a significant transaction throughput, a significant increase in transaction throughput for Solana and could potentially enable a new variety of use cases.
00:49:21.818 - 00:49:49.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm interested to see how the fired answer stuff actually influences projects that are live today. Like Soul, like with their client that tries to extract some Mev. It's like, are they going to have to switch? I don't know how that's actually going to look, but might cause some problems for some protocols that might be worth paying attention to. But I think that's a good place to end it. If you guys can't tell, we're a little bit low energy. It's a Friday. Monday is usually when we're full on energy and Friday is the low energy day.
00:49:49.014 - 00:49:56.934, Speaker A: So everyone have a great weekend on this call, I guess, because people will be listening to this on a Wednesday, but nonetheless, thanks for coming on, guys.
00:49:56.972 - 00:50:14.446, Speaker B: Hey everyone, thanks so much for tuning into today's episode. We hope. Really enjoyed it.
