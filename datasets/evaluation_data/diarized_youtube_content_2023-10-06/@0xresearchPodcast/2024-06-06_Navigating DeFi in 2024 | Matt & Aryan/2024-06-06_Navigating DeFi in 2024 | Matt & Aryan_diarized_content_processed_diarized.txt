00:00:00.320 - 00:00:39.590, Speaker A: Look at Pendle, for instance. Like Pendle, you could have been buying Pendle at around five to ten mil fdv at one point in time, and now it's above a bill. So I think that's what's really cool about this market, is that it gives retail the ability to deploy capital into existing protocols that trade at or below private rounds. You get to deploy capital into a market that trades like venture, in my opinion. Some of these things are pre product and pre revenue, and you can buy them liquid, which is effectively liquid investing, but with a venture framework behind it, which I think is really cool. And that's one of the things that really enticed me to start deploying capital into this market when I first started.

00:01:53.320 - 00:02:03.204, Speaker C: What's up, guys? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Today I'm joined by Matt and Arian from CMT Digital, as well as our very own Daniel Smith from the research team. Thanks for joining, guys.
00:02:03.504 - 00:02:04.844, Speaker D: Thank you for having us.
00:02:05.944 - 00:02:07.324, Speaker A: Thanks for having us on.
00:02:10.024 - 00:02:14.444, Speaker C: Before we get started, do you guys want to give a short introduction of yourselves as well as CMT Digital?
00:02:14.984 - 00:02:42.282, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. I'll give you an intro on CMT. First, I'll dive into an intro myself. So Matt and I both work for CMT Digital. CMT Digital. We exist as the blockchain investments and policy and regulatory advocacy subsidiary of the CMT Group, and the CMT Group is a larger proprietary trading firm. By background, the CMT Group itself was established in 97 around the genesis of electronic trading in Frankfurt, Germany.
00:02:42.282 - 00:03:27.972, Speaker D: So really had a adoption approach to technology when it comes to trading markets, and that's been a kind of core focus of the firm since inception. Took the form of electronic trading through the nineties. High frequency trading throughout the two thousands is ultimately kind of the lens through which we got interested in blockchain and digital assets starting in 2013. So CMT Digital was established, we joined the Blockchain association to start gathering some legal and regulatory footing before making initial investments in 2015, spinning up the crypto desk in 2017. We're also an RIA in the space, and we launched our first venture fund in 2018. I joined at the beginning of venture fund two back in 2021. So I've been here for about three years now.
00:03:27.972 - 00:04:10.474, Speaker D: We're on our third investment vehicle. We've supported over 150 portfolio companies to date, and we think of ourselves as generalists within the space, really looking to invest in companies that are either using blockchain technology to bring efficiencies to markets external to blockchain historically, or actually investing in companies that are iterating on the blockchain infrastructure itself, whether cryptographically bringing in new primitives or iterating on the blockchain stack. So pleasure to me. I got my start at the Blockchain Research Institute in 2017 in Canada with the tab scots and yeah, pleasure to join you guys today. Thank you.
00:04:17.134 - 00:05:04.556, Speaker A: And on my end, I've been here at CMT Digital for six and a half years now. Started out as a junior trader as well as researching and executing event driven trades, and was an early defi user myself, using IDEX. Shout out to iDEXx back in 2018 for trading my PA and then out of that experience was a really early defi user, including everything that you guys are probably doing back then, LP and the curve, SBTC RenPTC pool pre curve launch, and bought a bunch of baskets of a bunch of long tail defi stuff, including synthetix, yearn, even like stuff like zlot, hedgehog based, and pretty much every food farm under the sun, which effectively translates to what I do now for CMT.
00:05:04.660 - 00:05:26.574, Speaker C: Perfect, Matt, just to kind of go off that, since you've been in, let's say, defi for the past six years or so, how do you think, like, the app landscape is now, especially like at this period? Because I feel like there's more infrastructure than apps currently. Do you think there's like a lot to do on chain, or were you having more like, fun and it was more interesting for you back then as stuff was like very new?
00:05:29.234 - 00:06:39.614, Speaker A: It was more fun back then in the context of everyone was making ridiculous AP wise, obviously, like when Sushiswap launched, for instance, their UmA pool was doing like, I think it was like 30 to 40 x APR out of the gate, which was absolutely insane. Those sort of opportunities are obviously no longer present. The metas changed a bit, whereas back in 2020, users were more engaged in posting assets as collateral on these food farms and then using that to farm the underlying token for an insanely high APR that has effectively been farmed into oblivion. But we have this new interesting meta that's formed over the past few months, in particular with Athena launching, which is points farming on that front. It's obviously very highly dilutive in its current form, and the trade has become overcrowded post season, one of Athena being concluded. But I still think there's a few other opportunities, particularly within the pendle white teas, that could be potentially interesting.
00:06:42.834 - 00:07:21.688, Speaker C: Yeah, I looked into those points programs, um, like the pendle and using it to trade, but I never thought that it was, like, particularly beneficial, because, like you said, I feel like they got diluted up really quickly, and then Eigen Lair had a whole issue with how to reward them. Um, I think they later fixed it up. But I. I actually want to talk to you guys a bit about points programs. Like, how do you see that working out over the next six months? Let's say? Do you think we're going to go back to regular old airdrops, or do you think we're going to keep having this for. Because it worked really well for Pendle. Gearbox did quite well off it as well, just like farming points.
00:07:21.688 - 00:07:23.004, Speaker C: What do you guys think?
00:07:32.224 - 00:08:43.544, Speaker A: I'm under the opinion that it's kind of on a case by case basis. Right? Like you saw, like, Renzo kind of screw it up in terms of just user feedback from that pie chart that they rolled out. I think it really comes down to how teams are effectively allocating these particular allocations on the airdrop side of things. On the pendle side, I'm sure you guys saw. But as USD is now allocating more of their yield to holders of state USD, and so I think there's some interesting opportunities there, particularly if you look at the July 25 expiry YT product for susde. If you run a few calculations, you can see that the average APR right now is quite high, and on a profit percentage basis, you're looking at probably around 90% to 100% APR, assuming that. Assuming that the yield effectively stays around that 37% price point, and assuming a 5% allocation at the current FTV level, which I think is personally pretty reasonable, just given the season one was 5%.
00:08:43.544 - 00:09:11.238, Speaker A: And that seems to be the general framework, too. You're seeing a lot of teams allocating in that 5% tranche going forward. But, you know, as I mentioned before, too, like, we're seeing, like, tv alls explode, you know, swells above two. Bill Etherfi is above four. They're like four or five, last time I checked. And so it is becoming a pretty crowded environment. But I still think that there are selective opportunities, particularly within the pendle ecosystem.
00:09:11.326 - 00:10:11.694, Speaker D: To add to what Matt's saying. I think it's down to the LRT providers and also the platforms like Pendle to ensure kind of high transparency surrounding some of these assets. I think with Brenzo, it was a case of you weren't exactly sure what the underlying claim was to, and so that's why you saw that deviation start to form. And so it's about having that deep liquidity at the token level to support kind of free movements in and out of something like wrapped Ethan in the case of Etherfire, as well as being able to be comfortable knowing that the asset is properly representative of the underlying claims. And I think that's something that is more of a trial and error process, especially at this beginning stages, as we're seeing these primitives come out. A lot of this stuff is being tried for the first time on the restaking level. So I'm not expecting it would be naive to expect everything to go perfectly.
00:10:11.774 - 00:10:41.214, Speaker C: I kind of want to get you guys opinion on cash flow projects like staking to earn some form of protocol, earn revenue. How do you. I feel like those projects have largely died out. I think the only one that's relatively popular still is Makerdao. How do you guys see that space evolving? Do you think we go back to the roots and not roots, but I guess what we had over the bear market, where everyone was searching for some form of cash flow or some form of, like, revenue.
00:10:48.274 - 00:11:57.144, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, at a high level, we've seen massive dispersion within the market. YTD. I personally am of opinion that we continue to see this, particularly with than the Defi environment, which has undergone a ton of innovation since it became a household name four years ago. But in Maker's case, too, I think very well positioned to capture a cash flow narrative as well as, you know, what they're doing with endgame, doing their 24,000 to one redomination of supply. So that cuts priced significantly, which should, in theory, boost retail demand, which is consensus at this point in time. You know, they recently injected 300 mil into, you know, staked USdAI, and then UsDaI pools on Morpho. And then, you know, as you know, I'm of the opinion that as users loop their exposure to staked USD, we should see borrow, you know, hover close to the underlying yield, which just, you know, increased to 37% target.
00:11:57.144 - 00:12:35.194, Speaker A: And as those converge, you know, in theory, we should see this integration granting maker higher stake USD yields going forward. And they have obviously, the option to, you know, inject an additional 700 mil die, obviously. Fantastic. You know, if you look back at the previous quarter of this year, it was a strong one for them. Again, they doubled run rate revenue to 422 million, driven by, naturally, higher interest rates post Athena launching, obviously. So they're sitting on that narrative. Well, obviously, no, gearbox is two.
00:12:35.194 - 00:13:12.194, Speaker A: And then with Eigen layer launching too, we should see that be another catalyst for improving their already robust run rate too, which is on their subdoubt structure too. They're recently launched morpho vaults, which are, you know, it looks like they're earning seven mil annualized from that alone. And then, as I mentioned before, with Eigen launching too, I think you'll see some pretty heavy incentives for restakers post launch. And that kind of turns maker into this massive ethereum yield farm in itself, in my opinion.
00:13:13.214 - 00:13:57.968, Speaker E: Yeah, Makerdao is really interesting. You mentioned their integrations with Morthrow and using their D three M core credit line. It's been really fascinating to me to watch their revenue composition shift away from RWas and into crypto backed loans. That's kind of been, if you remember, like Q 420 23, that was like the risk, right? They were this RWA focused asset that was accruing a ton of yield specifically from these RWAs. And it was like 60% to 70% of their income was, or, sorry, the revenue was coming from RWAS. We were in this high rate environment where consensus was rates were more likely to go down than up, which would have a negative impact on Makerdao's revenue. And so we fast forward to today, and that shift has greatly pivoted away from rwAs.
00:13:57.968 - 00:14:28.754, Speaker E: Now, RWAs have a competition of about 33% of their Q two forecasted income revenue. Again, sorry. And it's been interesting because that's not really for a fault of rwas. Revenue decreasing in Q 120, 24 was 26 million throughout the Q one, and in Q two it's trending towards 32. It's really just the idea that crypto backed loans are actually coming back and becoming a useful source of revenue of income for makerdao.
00:14:32.014 - 00:15:40.654, Speaker A: Yeah, we've seen some interesting pivots within the RW space in the context of relying effectively on T bill yields in a high rate environment to drive revenue, which we've seen that was perforating at the back half of last year. But for example, Maple, which is a liquid holding for us, they had a very interesting mechanism launch last year that was tokenizing T bill through a lending mechanism. I think at its peak they had about 80, roughly 80 mil in net deposits at its peak, I believe. But then we're seeing some really interesting stuff devolved with their private credit facility. Even last night we saw three mil get deposited into their direct pools. You're seeing 200 accounts created consistently on a weekly basis. TVL has two x'ed for their secured lending arm, and their aggregate TVL cross products recently surpassed 175 mil, which we haven't seen since 2022.
00:15:40.654 - 00:15:51.934, Speaker A: So that's really cool to see too. A lot of these teams have been pivoting to offer these new intuitive products to combat potential for rate hike decreases over the next years too.
00:15:53.434 - 00:16:14.724, Speaker C: One thing I wanted to ask related to these real world asset shifts is how you guys view tokenized equities like we had. I think we've talked about this like internally over the past few weeks, and on my end, I don't see like, I think there's no real demand for it right now and I don't see there being really any demand for it in the future. But what do you guys think? Do you have like a.
00:16:17.824 - 00:17:23.164, Speaker D: I think it's down to what the post tokenization use case is going to be. And I just don't know if we have the depth in product offerings at DeFi level to be able to really make it attractive for people to. Because it's not trivial, right? You have to figure out where the custody is, how you would actually go about tokenizing this equity piece, what legal and regulatory considerations then come with that? And then where are you going to deploy it and actually put those assets to work? I think that is changing. We're seeing increasing numbers of particular markets being formed for this, both on the private and public side. Provenance blockchain has existed for quite some time and has multi billion worth of real world assets tokenized on their chain. I think it's about how do these environments that are then going to be holding these tokenized equities going to be expanding to the rest of DeFi to actually increase the alert to make those assets productive?
00:17:26.024 - 00:18:43.804, Speaker A: For me, I'm not entirely sure how concrete the TAM is for tokenized equities in particular, obviously for tokenized t bill yield, that's attractive, particularly for daos that want access to safer yields with a higher rate that you receive versus, let's say, depositing USDC as collateral on Aave. And it's fixed. So you know what the payout's going to be. It's predictive over time, which makes it additionally more attractive. And it's a passive vehicle for collecting yield without much activity needed to manage your position. Whereas, you know, if you want tokenized access to a US traded equity and you're living, you know, 12 hours ahead of time, somewhere halfway across the world, managing those positions becomes a little more difficult in theory, in my opinion, given the timestamp duration where you're not just based in the US, and there's also the thought of like, who exactly, if they're crypto native, are going to be buying these things. Me, along with all of you are, are probably our trading crypto because that's where our core edge is.
00:18:43.804 - 00:18:48.564, Speaker A: I just don't have any edge, you know, day trading Apple call options.
00:18:48.684 - 00:19:07.544, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree with you, Matt. That's. That's also been my thought process. It's like, I don't think I would have ever used it, and I don't really see the demand for it that much. Kind of shifting away from real world assets. What narratives do you guys, what narratives are you guys excited for over the next six to twelve months? Is there anything that you're specifically focused on?
00:19:08.394 - 00:20:34.334, Speaker D: So I'm taking a kind of broad look at infrastructure and execution. I think the execution frameworks pretty generally across the board are shifting and becoming more generally interoperable. We're seeing the rise of alt vms existence across different environments. We're seeing the rise of attention to intense based approaches, at least, and ongoing debate about kind of where the margins should exist within execution. And so spending a good amount of time thinking about those different topics and exploring the different landscapes generally, I'm of the opinion that execution is going to become increasingly multi chain and leaning towards more of those intents based execution approaches. It's just a lot of the intense approaches are very ambiguous right now, and it's unclear largely how we're going to get from a declarative kind of transaction building format as exists today at the EVM level, to a more generalizable execution framework that allows you to have multi hop execution, multivm execution. That's pretty interesting to think about and pretty multifaceted in terms of different infrastructure pieces having to coordinate together to support it.
00:20:35.554 - 00:21:03.110, Speaker E: Who are the key players in that world? Because to me it seems like it'd be sort of the market makers that sit behind those intents. The applications surface, the user intents from the user, and kind of shovel them towards these market makers that play a key role. And then there's probably some intent, like infrastructure, right? Like some RFQ model across is building this, DBridge is building this. There's many other players in that space. But I'm just curious, how do you think about the landscape there and who the important pieces are?
00:21:03.302 - 00:22:18.964, Speaker D: I think market makers to begin, for sure, but I think market makers involvement actually provides a longer tail term approach for actual infrastructure coordination. And the reason I say that is because market makers are going to be essentially fulfilling all of these lower hanging fruit intents at the beginning at least. And in doing so, they're building up a backlog of data of, you know, what are the most common routes, what are the most common asset swaps, what are the most common sought after things for users, and in doing so, then have a database that can be used to actually build some of these more commonly traversed paths across the multi chain graph. And that would then allow the more decentralized solver markets to collaborate and start fulfilling some of these routes potentially more efficiently than market makers would themselves. And I think it raises the question of where should the margin lie within intent execution? Should it lie with the market makers themselves, or should it lie at the MEV infrastructure level? And, yeah, that can get quite fiery in terms of a debate.
00:22:21.024 - 00:22:57.830, Speaker E: Yeah, let's take it there then. It's a fiery debate. That's the fun part. Right? And so it's interesting because if we end up in that world, like, all right, where would I want me as an investor? Like where do I want to put my attention to then? Because market makers will are sort of just like private entities. Maybe you can get like an equity play there. But to me, it doesn't seem like the guys in the middle, the middleware. So like the RFQ infrastructure kind of gets any cut of this, right? It'll be like the market makers demanding their side of the cut and the app layer demanding their side of the cut, which largely they might use to return to users.
00:22:57.830 - 00:23:08.074, Speaker E: And some future end state. But is that a good way of thinking about this? Like, to me, it seems like the RFQ infrastructure that sits in the middle is kind of just hard for them to get any meaningful margin.
00:23:08.504 - 00:23:56.744, Speaker D: Agreed? No, I think the margin will lie with the market makers to begin with. You're going to have the cost of a defi native execution, and market makers are naturally incentivized to match and just underpin that. And so as the market making intent fulfillment space becomes more competitive, that bar will naturally get pushed further down from where the Defi execution is. But in doing so, they're kind of a Trojan horse because they bring the data that will allow the more decentralized solver networks to then undercut them. And so then the decentralized solver networks then start setting the bar, in my opinion. And will market makers then be able to compete with that? I mean, depends on how much access data they have. I would argue yes, probably they will.
00:23:56.744 - 00:24:08.058, Speaker D: But I think it is not unconceivable that the decentralized solver networks will be able to kind of hold the margin at the end.

00:25:11.652 - 00:25:53.880, Speaker C: The age of interoperability is here. With the launch of Teleporter, Avalanche becomes a seamlessly linked network of many sovereign blockchains that communicate so smoothly they feel like a single chain teleporter is an EVM compatible cross chain communication protocol built on top of Avalanche Corp. Message. It allows any EVM chain on avalanche to send messages, assets and data to one another in a simple, fast, affordable and secure way. Teleporter and Avalanche Wordpressing provide a new foundation for how avalanche blockchains can communicate and how developers can easily build cross chain applications out of the box.

00:25:53.880 - 00:25:58.524, Speaker C: Matt, what about you? What have you been looking into over the past couple months?
00:26:01.984 - 00:27:39.182, Speaker A: So the two things that I found to be intellectually interesting over the past couple of months is looking at restaked roll ups and particularly with swell because they've amassed a pretty large amount of TVL over the past month. Really, they've surpassed two bill of TVL, understandably so. This has kind of been the general playbook for restaking services. You know, they launch and within 30 days they have amassed more than a billion of TVL, resulting in massive appetite for the underlying I think what's interesting in the swell example is not just the KPI's that they managed to hit quickly, it really comes down to the fact that when their token is staked, it accrues sequencer fees. And I think that in theory this should solve a pretty big problem within the l two environment, in my opinion. Whereas existing l two s such as optimism and arbitrum have in my opinion, this disconnect between the sequencer and the token holders, where essentially by staking it to accrue the fee as a user, it effectively negates that pain point between holders and the sequencers, in my opinion. And they've already accrued on the fee side more than a million dollar generated on a 10% take rate too.
00:27:39.182 - 00:29:07.774, Speaker A: So if a bull market comp analysis is produced, I think personally you could see that hitting five over time. And it just like kind of with these kind of variables too, it just seems to me that they're positioned really well out of the l two s to kind of capture this defi activity as it relates to restaking over time. And then I also think too like another avenue too that I'll mention here is that the avenue for enhanced staking rewards coming via Eigen layer for users who opt in to restake and receive that extra yield by delegating to an operator who supports, you know, Avss on the network, which should pose the same opportunity cost as staking eth. But with the caveat being like this one is the larger value prop as it allows users to kind of, you know, capitalize on restake rewards as well. And then the other thing that I've been looking at recently that I find to be really interesting is just like toxic order flow in general, and different mechanisms that are being integrated and created today to combat that. Particularly from both like the historical IL perspective, right. That LP's are having to deal with as well as LDR as well.
00:29:07.774 - 00:29:57.754, Speaker A: And kind of interesting new mechanisms that protocols are coming with. You have ambient that's been doing some cool stuff in this regard. The big thing to me too, is that needs to be solved for this to become a viable trading solution is latency, obviously. And you're seeing that too with bonding requirements being cut for the cows ammo. And I think over time, you want to see some really cool stuff kind of emerge from this that negates, to varying degrees, toxic flow accrued to LP's within the Dex environment. And I think we're going to see some pretty cool stuff too. Being launched at the back of uni V four launching as well, particularly with dynamic fees and how those kind of relate to cutting LBR.
00:29:58.614 - 00:30:33.524, Speaker D: I think the toxic flow point is also important for thinking about the intents development. Obviously, intense networks, solver networks as well as market makers are going to be more incentivized to go to venues without toxic flow. And so when looking at methods of capturing the actual conversion from the transaction execution as it exists today, to intense, it's really a function of where does that good toxic, non toxic flow exist? And how can those solver networks then plug in?
00:30:36.304 - 00:31:07.954, Speaker C: Yeah, I actually kind of want to ask you guys about Matt. You mentioned that these projects, these rest taking projects, they get one bill in TVL in like under a month. And there's this huge appetite for these. I asked this to Sriram as well, but I want to under like Eigen layer has 15 billion TVL. That's a whole lot of security. And I just don't know if that's like even necessary at this point. How do you guys think about that? Do you like, do you think there'll be a mass outflow eventually, or do you think they'll manage to incentivize these restakers?
00:31:08.254 - 00:31:17.982, Speaker D: So I wrote a relatively long paper on restaking. It's on our website. And it kind of dives into this point. If anyone's interested in diving in fully, it's a banger.
00:31:18.038 - 00:31:19.634, Speaker E: It's going in the show notes.
00:31:21.534 - 00:32:51.884, Speaker D: Thanks, dad. But in that paper explored kind of the risks of restaking. And I don't think that restaking poses a risk to the economic security layer, kind of, as has been discussed before, to the point of kind of cascading security risks. I think the longer tail risk of something like Eigen layer or AVss that operate on top of Eigen layer is what's going to be the long term draw for delegator to stay delegated within a certain number of ABS's. And with that, I mean the post eigen layer points drop, or whatever the current incentives are, what's going to be the longer term draw. And if it's just 4%, or if it's just the base yield, but denominated in that AV's token, I think that one thing is really important is, is how closely correlated is that AVSS economics to Ethereum itself? If there's kind of really high correlation between the AVSS value and Ethereum's value, that is, if the AV's is kind of deriving its value from Ethereum itself, what is it bringing to the ethereum ecosystem by existing as an AV's? And I would argue that AVss are best positioned when they are valuable in their own regard, as opposed to being a derivative of Ethereum. Now, I'm not saying they're altered of Ethereum, but you want to be bringing in value that's external to Ethereum, to Ethereum through Eigen layer.
00:32:51.884 - 00:33:50.714, Speaker D: And I think that is also then incentivizing the delegators to continue receiving the rewards as it is valuable in and of its own. And they are therefore more likely to not just sell and compound into ETh. I think it's also a matter of, for avss, as they're looking to launch on top of eigenlayer, it is really a non deterministic future layer level of security that they're going to have access to. And so they need to get comfortable with what's their minimum sort of bar of security that they need to be safe. And what do they, within some confidence interval, expect to have at some future point in time. And I know that it's very early for Eigen layer, and this is all kind of stuff that's being actively worked on. And I don't think there could be a better team behind a proposal like Eigen layer to be kind of thinking about these things.
00:33:50.714 - 00:33:56.030, Speaker D: But it's just some of the points that we considered during our research that's interesting.
00:33:56.062 - 00:34:29.920, Speaker E: You mentioned the yield factor here as well, because Mev Boost has about, I don't know about, let's call it a 90, 95% opt in rate neighborhood. That's probably a little high. Um, and it adds about 25 basis points to staking yield. So it's, it's like, not that much, um, when you, when you look at it on percentage basis, but everybody is still collectively opting into it. Um, how do you think about the dynamic there and, and the idea that, you know, maybe it doesn't take a massive yield number for ETh stakers to say, hey, you know, this is like marginally extra work for me, I'm going to do this anymore ways.
00:34:30.032 - 00:35:25.614, Speaker D: Well, I think also, I think this touches on the argument that happened between kind of Renzo and Ethify, because with MeV boost, what are you opening yourself up to in terms of risk? It's kind of a set amount of risk that doesn't really increase, but with every additional Abs that you delegate to, the risk is compounding, and it's also not related risk. I mean, they're both slashing, but the AV's could set very different slashing conditions. And so you're getting compounding levels of risk the more avss you secure, but not necessarily compounding yield, because the yield is going to be differently denominated, different assets, not necessarily compounding in ETH. And so I think the marginal gain that you get with each additional Abs is very much unknown, but the marginal risk is more known.
00:35:27.754 - 00:35:44.614, Speaker E: Is there any world where slashing never goes live? I mean, if you think about Solana, right, like Solana wants to, like, eventually we'll have slashing, but it's just not there today, and it's not on the immediate step. Next steps. Right. Is there any, is there any chance that Eigen Lair does the same thing?
00:35:47.814 - 00:36:32.654, Speaker D: I would say there is a chance, yeah. I think it also speaks to the whole, what do you want to be covered within the scope of consensus, and if there are mechanisms by which you can cryptographically verify certain actions and prevent them as a result, that could be an attractive way of preventing having to implement slashing. But I'm struggling to understand kind of what other mechanisms you could put in place to incentive align, to align incentives, and please let me know if there's anything you've come across. But I found it hard to find alternatives to slashing.
00:36:33.474 - 00:36:57.374, Speaker E: Reputation, my friend, the social layer. Classic. I want to change tuna here a little bit. Arian, you and I have once, once in a lifetime ago, it feels like chatted about near at quite some length. And when I was looking at the charts coming into this pod, and near has just been rock solid, man. They cannot. The markets kind of had some ups and downs over the last two months, but not near.
00:36:57.374 - 00:37:03.254, Speaker E: I'm curious, what's the boss tell us? Tell us about the near thesis. Is this thing still alive or what?
00:37:04.834 - 00:38:05.966, Speaker D: So the near foundation has gone through some changes in the past year. I mean, Ilya has taken the helm again. I think what drew me to Nier back in 2021 was the strength of the infrastructure, in my opinion. I really liked the doomslug finality gadget. I liked Nightshade sharding. I think they're one of the only monolithic approaches to horizontal scaling that I've come across, and I'm quite a big fan of horizontal scaling. I think near has gone through a process of trying to figure out its place within the ecosystem, and it's reached what I would argue is a little bit of an inflection point in that they've got this critical mass of tooling, whether it's developer tooling for things like Java, whether it's library support, or whether it's kind of the SDK itself indexing as well as a public good.
00:38:05.966 - 00:38:57.764, Speaker D: They've kind of reached this point where it can be expandable. It's just a matter of where do they want to sit? Do they want to sit the private key infrastructure level for chain abstraction and kind of coordinate everything that way? Do they want to be more of a defi native environment for kind of fast finality? Do they want to lean into the DA layer for fast finality? Or is it kind of a mixture of all? I think we're moving in that chain abstraction thesis for execution anyway, I would argue that's what intents is leaning into, too. So I see an increasing area of potential engagement for NIA, and it's a matter of what sort of partnerships can they put in place and what sort of problems can they solve for project teams that exist today that would really help them capitalize on this opportunity?
00:38:58.864 - 00:39:21.288, Speaker E: That's interesting. Is it more of the chain abstraction side or my, like, really dumb left curve view of this has just been fast chain good, right? Solana's had a great last six months. SWE and Aptos are starting to put some of the pieces in the right spot. Of course, the last two months of those two specifically have been quite brutal, but, yeah. How do you think about my idea of just fast chain good?
00:39:21.416 - 00:39:57.826, Speaker D: Look, I think fast train good, but I'm not going to kid. I mean, Nio hasn't had the user experience that Solana has historically, and I think that has been a huge barrier to adoption. The wallet infrastructure specifically hasn't been great, and I think that's stuff that the team absolutely knows about and has been working on. So perhaps through these updates that we're seeing coming through this year, that will change significantly. And it's one that I'm definitely keeping my eye on as a very early paras and ref user. It would certainly help me if that did come back, but I'm not particularly counting on it.
00:39:58.010 - 00:40:07.054, Speaker E: Yeah, the block explorer falls into that category too. But Matt, I'm curious how you view this whole near situation. Any thoughts on its development and where it's headed?
00:40:11.354 - 00:41:25.802, Speaker A: I think there's something to be said about the fact that near did not launch at a, in my opinion, ridiculously high fdv. I think it was somewhere in like the 500 mil mark initially. And I think that there is importance here with giving retail the ability to put on position in the liquid environment into these upper tier l one s as perceived by the market at a valuation that isn't obscene to the point where you're paying, you know, 50 x above what private markets were pricing it at twelve months prior. And on that kind of point too, we saw Solana do that really well. There's a bit of survivorship bias with it, but, you know, Solana didn't raise a ridiculous amount of money at an insane val. And then they launched during the trough of 2020 and, you know, back then you were able to put on positions for, you know, sub a dollar for a decent amount of time too. And so I think from an FDV launch, it really awesome opportunity for retail to buy it at a reasonable liquid valuation out of the gate.
00:41:25.802 - 00:41:48.624, Speaker A: And then it is also potentially really attractive too, from just the general AI point of view too. Right? Like retail love Nvidia. Nvidia trades at large multiples above revenues. But it gives people like an on chain exposure to this AI narrative and a quickly growing protocol as well.
00:41:49.844 - 00:42:26.300, Speaker D: I would also argue that Nair is. Yeah, by the way, we love nairvide. One of the approaches of naira is they are a sleeping giant in the sense that they have a ton of users. Now, those users have no idea they're on blockchain, especially in the case of something like sweatcoin or Kai ching. I mean, these are. I remember in my apartment building when I was in the elevator, there was a guy and he pulled up sweatcoin on his phone. And I mean, maybe he was a crypto native guy, but he just seemed like it was someone who had come across sweat as the walking app.
00:42:26.300 - 00:42:49.104, Speaker D: And as a result of the blockchain experience being so abstracted away from them in that app. Historically, they've been able to onboard. Now those users have no interactions with blockchain today. But if the tooling and if the environment for that adoption does improve, then it allows them to onboard kind of these large bases of users that haven't historically been involved.
00:42:53.484 - 00:43:13.642, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like the AI neonarrative is aryan. What you mentioned where it was, they were really trying to find themselves a little bit. But I agree with you. I mean, I had no idea Kai Kai was on near and also sweatcoin as well. I had no idea. And I'm sure like, if I don't know, I'm sure there's like a million who also don't know. Um, I want to ask one last question.
00:43:13.642 - 00:43:39.670, Speaker C: I wanted to ask this after we brought up near, but the. I keep getting sucked into these like vc slash high FTV questions because they like, fascinated, they fascinated me. Over the past few weeks, I know that you guys have been looking into Ao AR. I kind of want to understand the thesis behind that because I've been hearing it quite often about it, and like near, it's been doing quite well. That's one of the charts that I checked before we hopped on.
00:43:39.702 - 00:44:30.314, Speaker D: So, so in terms of Arweave and AO. So Arweave is an investment that we, we've had for quite a few years. A thesis on Arweave is really around the permanent storage aspect. Now, Arweave historically has somewhat struggled to find its product market fit within that permanent storage aspect. Whether it's a lack of historic product differentiation or diversity in terms of the different types of storage that it can offer. It kind of didn't encompass a full solution that would allow anyone to switch completely over from their current provider. But Arweave is at a position now where it's kind of just the infrastructure is built and it's ticking along and it works.
00:44:30.314 - 00:45:31.250, Speaker D: And so what I think is really important and beautiful with AO is that it brings a whole new paradigm to Arweave itself. You now have this storage layer that is not only immutable and permanent, you can have kind of non permanent storage on there as well now, but also allows you to plug into the state management aspects associated with blockchains and compute on top of blockchains. And that hasn't been historically available. So what that opens up, I think, is a whole new depth to Arweave's capabilities. You can now not only store things on it, but form arbitrary proofs over it or have triggerable events in the form of cron jobs. In the case of AO. And that, I think, brings a level of liveness to the storage layer that hasn't historically existed and gets pretty excited when you think about corresponding state changes in other environments due to some state change on Arweave AO.
00:45:31.250 - 00:45:47.380, Speaker D: And I think generally that's one of the narratives liveness within smart contracts, reactive smart contracts, whether it's event log based coordination on a multi chain environment or whether it's through something like Arweave AO. Yeah, it's pretty exciting.
00:45:47.492 - 00:46:00.624, Speaker E: Yeah. The token sync angle is quite interesting as well. And Ari and I want to dive one step deeper onto one of the other. The piece that you mentioned around smart contract liveness, what's an interesting example that you could provide of why this may be useful?
00:46:02.764 - 00:46:58.646, Speaker D: I think it's useful for just. And I mean, I think it's multifaceted useful. You can have, obviously, you can have the well sought after things like limit orders, stop loss, but I would argue that that's not kind of the full realization of the potential offering for this technology. You really then allow multi chain execution as a result of, uh, these. This liveness. So if you have, like, uh. So if you have a smart contract that changes state on one chain that can emit an event log that is captured by some protocol that then coordinates a signing event on some other chain that allows some initial function to continue through this multi hop process, right now, we don't really have something that can coordinate that end to end process.
00:46:58.646 - 00:47:12.074, Speaker D: And so I think beyond just implementing more richness within execution and how you want to structure your execution, I think it allows you more depth across different environments in terms of your execution as well.
