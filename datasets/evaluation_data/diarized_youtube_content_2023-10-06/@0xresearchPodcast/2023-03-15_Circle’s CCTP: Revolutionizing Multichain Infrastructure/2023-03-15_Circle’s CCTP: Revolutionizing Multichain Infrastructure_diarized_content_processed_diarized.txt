00:00:00.170 - 00:00:09.360, Speaker A: It's interesting what's happening, but it's not great for USCC, right? We don't want liquidity fragmentation. We don't want developer and user confusion. So how can we tackle that?
00:00:11.730 - 00:00:59.422, Speaker B: Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We have a great interview today with Zhao Regignado from Circle discussing all things CCTP. So of course this episode was recorded prior to the meltdown down we've seen of what have been the last three days, but we're joined today by Xerox pibbles and effort capital to kind of discuss what exactly that meltdown was, what triggered it, what were the implications for the broader economy, as well as the crypto industry itself. And there were some interesting aftershocks that really rippled through DeFi as a whole that we can have the ability to view on chain and really dive into what exactly happened. But like I said, the interview itself was recorded prior to this whole event. But we are recording this on Monday, March 13. So we've got a pretty good picture of what happened.
00:00:59.422 - 00:01:05.338, Speaker B: Sam, why don't I throw things over to you to kind of give us a breakdown of what the last 72 hours have really contained.
00:01:05.434 - 00:01:55.706, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been a crazy last three days. I didn't get to enjoy my weekend as much as I would have liked to, but we saw basically the three largest banking partners from the US for crypto companies go kaboom. So that's unfortunate. Basically, signature went out last week or the week before, and then Friday it was announced that Silicon Valley bank was going to close, which is a huge bank for all things VC tech startup industry. And we saw the big names like Bill Ackman and many others kind of advocating for a bailout. And then Sunday, what do you know? The Fed came out, they announced that signature would also be closing, which was the final crypto bank. And they would also be standing up a facility called the bank term funding program, where banks can lend their assets at par value at pretty favorable terms if they are met with a liquidity crunch due to a bank run.
00:01:55.706 - 00:02:24.150, Speaker C: So that really eased worries around USDC and the 3.3 billion they had parked at Silicon Valley bank because they knew that everyone would be made 100% full. Sorry. But yeah, there's a lot of interesting ramifications. I'm sure everyone's heard about it a ton. So we're going to do a little hot seat cool throne with just a rapid fire list of items that we have here, because there's a lot of them this week. I guess we can start with USDT buyers, would you guys throw them in the hot seat or the cool throne?
00:02:24.230 - 00:02:50.206, Speaker D: They're easily on the hot seat. So, like Sam, like you mentioned, at one point, USDC was down as much as eighty nine cents. I actually think I saw on finance us, it went as low as like $0.35 on like a scam wick. To the downside, it was absolutely mass panic. And people were just flocking to what they felt were the safest assets at the time. Which is funny, because we don't even understand USDTs or tether's counterparty risk.
00:02:50.206 - 00:03:14.138, Speaker D: But at that moment, everyone knew that tether was the flock to safety. USDC was at least partially unbacked. And on chain, and even on centralized exchanges, people were buying USDT at a 20% premium to USDC and were paying somewhere on the order of magnet, like a dollar three, a dollar four during the peak euphoria or fear during the market.
00:03:14.224 - 00:03:46.926, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I would covet this with, it depends when you became a USDT buyer. Right? So for those that capitulated at that 86, 87, 88 cent range, flipping their USDC, yeah, that's a hot seat. There's no doubt about it. Especially because the redeemable value, let's assume the circle, lost that 3.3 billion. That's about seven and a half percent or 8% of their total USDC reserves. So an 8% haircut would mean you're still redeeming for $0.92
00:03:46.926 - 00:04:28.740, Speaker B: on the dollar, presumably. So that really just goes to show. With that wick down sub $0.89, it really goes to show that this was truly a panic fueled crisis. And also goes to show the shortages, some shortages of on chain liquidity, right? Like uniswap, the largest decks by volume, the Univ three ranges got blown out, right? Because all of these stable swap pairs on uniswap, they get these very tight tick ranges, which maximizes the amount of liquidity for stable times. But when things get blown out, sure, there could have been $20 million in this univ. Three pool, but a very small percentage of that was actually in range when asset prices really blew out.
00:04:28.740 - 00:05:09.134, Speaker B: If you look at the curve pool, the deepest source of on chain liquidity for USDT and USDC, we see that really there was a crazy mismatch of tokens in that pool, right? So there's three different assets all pegged to a dollar. So ideally in perfect balance, you have 33% of each asset in the pool, while USDT's balance got as low as 1.4%. And the balance of USDC in the pool got as high as 90% of the assets. So you really just see everyone was in a mad dash to dump USDC. And we're looking at it today. We're looking pretty close to repegged, I think. Last I checked, we were like 99 five.
00:05:09.134 - 00:05:17.220, Speaker B: So, yeah, if you were an unfortunate seller of USDC in that lower 90 range, then you're in the hot seat this week.
00:05:17.990 - 00:05:31.640, Speaker C: Curve is another one you could throw on the cool throne here because, jeez, that volume, what was it, 6.4 billion? I think it doubled the next closest high on daily volume. So they were definitely raking in the fees, there's no doubt about that.
00:05:32.490 - 00:05:58.858, Speaker B: Yeah, I've actually got this pulled up in front of me. I'm writing a quick flash note here on all the things we saw that happened on chain. And since Friday, the three pool has seen over $8.3 billion of volume. And the USDC USDT pairs on Uniswap, which is two pools on two different fee tiers, have seen 6.4 billion. So two more billion dollars of curved three pool volume, and that's just churning out fees.
00:05:58.858 - 00:06:02.622, Speaker B: So V curve lockers. Another one in the cool seat this week.
00:06:02.676 - 00:06:43.914, Speaker E: Yeah, I'd say another big hot seat was definitely any DFI protocol that denominated debt in USDC, which was way too many. Like, you take this further to even, like, people were in a rush to withdraw from DyDX because it's like, all right, what does it matter if, you know, freaking toy coins when I'm going to pull off this USDC and it's not going to be worth anything. It kind of points back to that paper that Arthur Hayes dropped maybe a week ago about the Nakamoto dollar when he was proposing a delta neutral, bitcoin backed stablecoin that obviously wouldn't scale right now with what we have.
00:06:44.032 - 00:07:22.922, Speaker C: This kind of takes me back to the terra situation. It's like, man, what they were building was such a cool idea. Like, actually a decentralized stablecoin, but its time just wasn't ready and it probably won't be for the foreseeable future. But you could even throw, like, dow treasuries in the hot seat this week because I know I'm an investor in a lot of different dows who hold a vast majority of their token holdings in USDC. So I was like, man, if I own the equity of this treasury and USDC is de pegging, then that's directly affecting me. So I think it's a good lesson to be learned by DeFi protocols to actually diversify their treasuries into ETH or whatever the native asset is in that chain and kind of put their money where their mouth is.
00:07:23.056 - 00:08:15.322, Speaker D: And don't hard code USDC to be equal to a dollar, because we saw a lot of defi protocols doing that. That's not kosher. And another hot seat actually related just to explain how much of a mass panic there was one address leveraged Kyber swap, which is like an aggregator, a Dex aggregator, and they tried to swap $2 million worth of three curve, the LP position that represents that person's ownership of three pool, $2 million worth of three curve. Through Kyberswap, they ended up getting five cents of USDT. They went from $2 million to $0.05. They got MeV that badly in mass panic. So I saw there was a tweet from the Kyber team regarding how the situation unfolded, but just kind of that person had a really bad Friday night.
00:08:15.376 - 00:09:09.882, Speaker B: You hate to see that one, but I guess that one is a perfect segue into another cool throne, which would be anybody that's involved with ETH staking. So they're a validator if you're an LSD token holder you printed. The actual numbers were pretty insane. So there was a little over 5000 ETH of MeV distributed to stakers, which absolutely shatters the next recent high. I think it was somewhere in around one and a half 2000 ETH. And now if you look at the value of cash flow flowing to ETH stakers, so the burn, the priority fees and the MEV, that's actually flowing if you look at quarter over quarter. So q four of last year, compared to the expected values of q one this year, we're looking at an expected value of an increase in 36% in ETH terms and 61% in USD value.
00:09:09.882 - 00:09:43.878, Speaker B: So much of that's driven by the ETH burn itself. Just the uptick in volume has led to more ETH being burned, and of course that flows to all ETH token holders, including stakers. But a lot of that is indeed driven by MeV. So we've really seen this uptick in on chain activity, really drive more value to some of these ecosystem participants, and that really flows in with the curve thing as well, right? If you are a protocol that has the ability to turn FUD and panic into fees and revenue, you're sitting in a good place in this industry, because there is plenty of FUd to go around.
00:09:44.044 - 00:10:08.394, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. Another winner there, along with curve was synthetics and Quenta, they topped out. Their 24 hours volume exceeded 100 million, which kind of explains why synthetics rallied so heavily yesterday. But it's a great look. You love to see it, especially when you have people like Andrew King getting liquidated and just wrecking GMX.
00:10:08.522 - 00:10:39.126, Speaker C: How do you guys think Coinbase plays into this? I'd actually take the contrary intake. We've been gassing up Coinbase a lot the last few weeks, so I've got to bash on them a little bit. But why tweet out on 11:30 p.m. On a Friday night that USDC to USD conversions are no longer supported until Monday? I think that's kind of what started it all, because we saw the three pool getting imbalanced throughout the day on Friday. But USDC didn't actually dpeg until midnight on Friday night. I believe so. I don't know.
00:10:39.126 - 00:10:41.082, Speaker C: I was shocked that they would do it that way.
00:10:41.216 - 00:11:25.830, Speaker D: I think it was around the concern, not just with Silicon Valley, but at that time signature was still operational, we think. We don't really know because they got shut down on Sunday officially, but we didn't really know the status of their financial well being Friday night going into Saturday, and they were really the only operation that could do 24/7 off bank hours, mint and redemptions in partnership with Circle. So I'm sure it had to do with some with signature and just out of a cause of concern, not swapping USDC for one dollars, because again, we didn't really know how much of the contingent was going to spread come Monday morning. And I think everyone was really just on edge, waiting to see what the federal government was going to do on Sunday.
00:11:27.530 - 00:11:46.320, Speaker C: Yeah, I know they have that new banking partner too. I think it's called Cross River bank, and they're looking to do automated settlement for minting and redeeming of USDC. David, I think you mentioned earlier that that would be 24/7 but I haven't read that anywhere. Do you know for sure if that's going to be around the clock 365?
00:11:47.250 - 00:12:51.378, Speaker D: No, honestly, that's an assumption by me, just because I'd have to imagine. I think we were talking about it internally on one of our morning chats about a week ago, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a 24/7 mint redemption system, but I'd have to imagine off bank hours from five to nine eastern standard time if you're a market maker or if you're a user holding USDC and you can't redeem at a dollar in the liquidity crunch event or liquidity need event, what do you do? Does USDC de peg now even partially, just for having that inventory risk from five to nine off bank hours or even on a bank holiday like on Christmas day? Is USDC going to start depegging just because there's no 24/7 system? So I think circle knows and understands the need for this kind of payment always on system to work in parallel with crypto being a 24/7 marketplace. So that's my assumption that it is 24/7 but no official word on that yet.
00:12:51.464 - 00:13:13.642, Speaker C: Does anyone have an opinion on maker? They seem like the Dai supply actually grew over the weekend and that's still beyond me. If anyone understands why that happened, please tell me, because I don't get it. But regardless, they've got a lot more DaiUSDC reserves to deploy as treasury bills. So I'm curious what you guys think there.
00:13:13.696 - 00:13:37.694, Speaker D: Yeah, I can partially my understanding, and I didn't really even think about this, but in the need in a crisis event like this, a lot of people like to joke that Dai is just wrapped USDC. And while that is relatively true, I mean, at that time when the DPEG event occurred, die was only backed, I believe, 50 55% USDC. And the other backing was through non USDC.
00:13:37.742 - 00:13:38.002, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:38.056 - 00:13:44.110, Speaker D: Ethereum wrapped staked ETH real world assets.
00:13:44.190 - 00:13:44.386, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:44.408 - 00:14:34.418, Speaker D: So it is partially wrapped USDC. But I think in a flight to safety event, and you couldn't really get sizable volume and tether because of how much liquidity was drained from the curve pool, Dai was like this next area for a flight to safety. Now with that being said, dai dpegged just as much as USDC did. Because I think the market still aligns DAi with just being 100% backed by USDC, which is not the case. But in this event, I think people just flock to die as this potential area of safety. And to your point, the DAI supply grew 20 30% over the weekend. And now what maker can do is take this USDC that's on their PSM and then leverage their partnerships with Coinbase, in which moneytails Clydesdale like some of these real world asset originators, and then take that.
00:14:34.418 - 00:15:02.270, Speaker D: I don't know, I think it was like $2 billion worth of die. I'm sorry, worth of USDC. Take that $2 billion worth of USDC and actually invest it into yield into T bill to generate yield for DAI holders. So maker, even though there's a lot of FUD going around in the moment, they were actually a big winner in this and growing their PSM, expanding the Da Dai supply, and ultimately going to be able to create yield generating opportunities for their holders. So big winner.
00:15:02.770 - 00:15:42.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I would agree with that. They're a winner here. And I think Frax also applies to this next statement as well, in that we learned today that Fracs and Dai aren't pegged to the US dollar, they're pegged to USDC. We saw they both tanked pretty equally in line with the price action of USDC. And if you have to stop and ask yourself, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Ideally we do get those decentralized dollars, but today that's just not something we have the ability to generate. And Sam Kazimian has actually talked at length about this recently. And just that we need a FedMaster account enabling on chain dollars.
00:15:42.150 - 00:16:04.930, Speaker B: And I'm personally not sold that that will be a decentralized protocol. Being the one doing that. Surely the first participant in that will be. And like then at that point, then you do have risk free dollars, right? Those are almost equivalent to treasuries. There's no intermediary bank risk that we've seen is indeed an issue. Right. This is exactly what happened with SVB.
00:16:04.930 - 00:16:34.294, Speaker B: And that I think will be the big unlock at that point. And is that a CBDC? Is that not a CBDC is up for open debate. But to me, USDC really almost already is a CBDC. And I don't necessarily think that's like a horrible thing. No one's being forced to use USDC and it can already be blacklisted. And if the government wants to blacklist you with USDC, they can and they will. So I just like the optionality.
00:16:34.294 - 00:16:56.410, Speaker B: And if you want the most risk free on chain dollar, that will be a FedMaster account enabling an on chain provider like circle creating this. So personally, I would be excited at that. I think it remove another step of risk from the system and in a perfect world, I think we get multiple FedMaster accounts providing on chain dollars to again even distribute that and promote competition amongst the providers.
00:16:56.490 - 00:17:16.838, Speaker C: Yeah, 100% agree there. You can actually kind of tailing off that. Another cool throne could be Caitlin long. She's the founder of Custodia Bank. I highly recommend following her on Twitter because she's like a Wall street veteran, knows way more about this stuff than probably all of us combined. So she's like perfect for this. But she applied for a Fedmaster account and just got denied like a week ago.
00:17:16.838 - 00:17:47.154, Speaker C: So the timing is really convenient. It's like, why are you doing this. She's trying to start a crypto bank that kind of helps crypto companies that's always 108% collateralized by cash and cash equivalents in the form of T bills. So this would be the perfect solution for us. And she's been working on this for, like, four or five years, and she finally got word back that, no, it's not happening. So I think I'm in line with you, Dan. I think we do need someone with a FedMaster account who can settle these things as they should be.
00:17:47.154 - 00:17:49.380, Speaker C: But I think we're a little ways away from it.
00:17:50.790 - 00:18:25.242, Speaker B: Yeah, also agree there. What's everyone's take on the market cap change to USDC? It shed about three or so billion dollars worth of circles. USDC stablecoin kind of feels in line with what I would have expected. We got that late Sunday announcement that all deposits will be covered by the federal government. That kind of give you that safety blanket. I think that really slowed some of the rush to the exits. Like, okay, what's the point of really going and battling this? Especially if you were like, a large fund that held a significant amount of USDC.
00:18:25.242 - 00:18:35.826, Speaker B: You already have a vested interest in the space, and you basically need USDC to continue advancing effort. And I were just talking about that before this call. And so I don't know.
00:18:35.848 - 00:18:35.986, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:36.008 - 00:18:42.050, Speaker B: What's everyone's take on? Like, we lost 3 billion in market cap. Like, seem on par. Underreaction. Overreaction.
00:18:43.750 - 00:19:27.300, Speaker C: My take here would be, had the Fed not come out Sunday and done what they did, that USDC's market cap would be between 20 and 30 billion right now. And that hole would have gone from seven and a half to 8% to what would that be? Like 15% to 20%? I don't know. That's tough math on the spot, but you know what I'm saying? And I think they would have done it. I think they would have honored one to one redemptions to appear like everything's fine, when in reality, all of that cash was really kind of in the hands of the fed and the actions that they would take. So I think it could have been a lot worse. And I'm still surprised today to not see more of a market cap retraction. But that's a really good sign for the hopes of people and belief in USDC moving forward.
00:19:28.230 - 00:19:47.954, Speaker B: Doing mental math on a live recording, like, that's bold, I'll be honest. But, yeah, no, I agree with you. And that was my expectation too. Right? We just published the USDC monitor dashboard live on Dune. You guys should all go check that out. We'll throw a link in the description to that. But I was building that yesterday at like 06:00 I was 5 hours in when we get this announcement.
00:19:47.954 - 00:20:03.600, Speaker B: And yeah, I was basically, ah, well, this definitely isn't going to be as useful as it would have been had people been rushing to the gates. But nonetheless, it does give you a great oversight of kind of the liquidity and price action that we saw throughout this event.
00:20:04.290 - 00:20:32.614, Speaker D: You also got to think about like, if there was a $3.3 billion hole, let's assume every dollar that Circle had on Silicon Valley bank was written off to zero. Obviously that wasn't the case, but there's also a lot of USDC on chain that is in protocols that that USDC is not moving like anytime soon. So prior to the dive supply expanding over, I think it was like 2.2 to 2.4 billion USDC were in makers psm. So yes, there was a $3.3
00:20:32.614 - 00:21:12.786, Speaker D: billion hole on Circle's balance sheet for a temporary time, but there also is like billion, and that's just one D five protocol. There's like billions of USDC like Makerdow's PSM that probably was not going to come in and go to redeem one for one anytime soon. So I think there's a lot of locked USDC inherently in the DeFi ecosystem that really wasn't going to move. Just because it is not easy to move that size anytime soon, especially by DeFi protocols, that they can't just redeem USDC one for one without maybe some governance process to do that.
00:21:12.888 - 00:21:37.690, Speaker C: Yeah, I really want to know how much USDC has lost too. It's got to be a pretty high number, realistically speaking. It's like you always hear those stats about companies and why they sell gift cards still. It's like, why is this still a thing? Apparently they make a ton of money because there's always like a dollar and 25 left and it actually adds up to a significant amount. It's kind of like the same story there, but onto another hot seat or cool throw. And this one's pretty obvious. But what do you guys think about CZ Binance?
00:21:38.270 - 00:22:15.334, Speaker E: I think it's interesting. Specifically, I'm curious if there's further action coming from the government against Binance that he's looking to move this billion dollar fund out of stablecoins. And you have to wonder if he's splitting that in bitcoin, ETH, and BNB, if he's buying that much BNB and a regulator is coming after binance, then perhaps he's giving exit liquidity to early investors in binance. So there's a lot of shady stuff going on and will be lots of fun to watch.
00:22:15.452 - 00:22:25.766, Speaker B: It's conspiracy theory season. Then I guess the other conspiracy theory is this was part of a coordinated attack against crypto banks.
00:22:25.798 - 00:22:25.994, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:26.032 - 00:23:04.898, Speaker B: Like the signature bank happened on a weekend late at night, when just kind of felt out of place. And I'm not a bank balance sheet expert, but my understanding is it didn't quite have the same level of risk as SVB did, and yet it still kind of got brought down in the crosshairs of this all. And I guess that would throw Nick Carter on the cool throne for calling this madness out. Gosh, that was probably, like, already two months ago, and he was really all over operation choke point and continually flagging things related to the effort to kind of control or constrain the amount of capital flowing into this industry.
00:23:04.994 - 00:23:10.722, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree to your point. Signature was not in great financial standing.
00:23:10.786 - 00:23:11.014, Speaker A: Really?
00:23:11.052 - 00:23:56.882, Speaker D: No regional bank was heading into the weekend. I think as of end of 2022, on their balance sheet, they had about $6 billion in cash and about $17 billion worth of available for sale securities that they can liquidate in the event of a bank run. And that's obviously at the end of year. But in total, they had about $23 billion in available funds, technically, that could liquidate an event of a bank run. And they only supposedly saw $10 billion worth of withdrawals on Friday. So they technically should have had an additional $13 billion, give or take a billion, probably about $13 billion of liquidity left. And CNBC announced a report and commented.
00:23:56.882 - 00:24:54.874, Speaker D: They got comments from Barney Frank, who wrote Dodd Frank, one of the landmark bills of the 2008 financial crisis, and he's a board member of signature, and he explicitly stated that to their knowledge, heading into Saturday, Signature bank was still in a decent enough standing to survive, and that they were pretty much told on Sunday that they had to shut it down. Meanwhile, there's banks like First Republic. They were able to, I guess, get a liquidity injection from JPMorgan, but they were not in good financial standing. And there's a handful of banks that are this morning on the stock market that fell 50, 60, or 30% plus on the day just because of this mass panic. It really does not make sense for signature to be the sole bank to be shut down in these events. And it's just really odd timing, because within the same five minute window that they announced this new federal program, they announced that signature bank was getting closed. They did not make a big thing about it.
00:24:54.874 - 00:25:00.182, Speaker D: So I'm not one for conspiracy theories of wearing a tinfoil hat, but this one feels a little shady.
00:25:00.246 - 00:25:00.522, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:00.576 - 00:25:24.530, Speaker E: And then you add to that that all these funds based in the US, like, a lot of them used signature, and now they have to go through the whole process of finding another bank, and there's a good likelihood they won't get approved anywhere, and then they have to go to offshore banks. So really terrible move by regulators, and it's just kind of pushing crypto further away.
00:25:24.680 - 00:26:01.214, Speaker C: Yeah, I buy the theory. To be honest, I don't think this whole entire situation was stirred up specifically just to get rid of crypto and make it harder in the US. But I do think it was a convenient outcome. I mean, we had a Fed official last week saying literally, as silver bank was being, or sorry, Silicon Valley bank was being kind of like, run on, say, how much better off FDIC insured banks are, when he didn't even realize at the time that he was speaking, like, there was literally a bank run occurring. And then you also have members of Congress like Elizabeth Warren kind of, like, provoking these bank runs. It's just really weird. None of it adds up.
00:26:01.214 - 00:26:08.734, Speaker C: Why did signature get picked at all the banks? I'm definitely on the Nick Carter camp and throwing him in the cool throne for calling this one out well in advance.
00:26:08.862 - 00:26:44.000, Speaker E: I do have one more cool throne, and that's y two k finance on arbitrum, the exotic stablecoin peg market. I shouted this out in the newsletter a few weeks ago when there was another wave of USDC FUD. But people who were deposited in the risk vault. If you deposited one ethereum in the USDC DPeG vault, you just got paid out 50 ethereum. And I think they had, like, four or five stablecoins dpeg this past weekend. So people who were gambling on there got paid huge.
00:26:47.090 - 00:26:53.006, Speaker C: Is there a way to use y two k to bet on repegs, or is it only dpeg insurance?
00:26:53.108 - 00:26:53.374, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:53.412 - 00:27:04.450, Speaker E: So there's a risk and a hedge fault. And whichever is the opposite of the dpeg is you just like betting that it won't dpeg. So I guess that's the closest thing to it.
00:27:04.520 - 00:27:05.634, Speaker C: So what a lot of people will.
00:27:05.672 - 00:27:21.740, Speaker E: Do is they'll deposit into USDC, won't lose its peg this epoch, so they'll get paid out like 30% in y two k tokens. And those y two k tokens share fees when actual dpeg events do happen.
00:27:22.110 - 00:27:28.554, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah. And isn't the range on that pretty tight? Don't they define a dpeg as 99?
00:27:28.592 - 00:27:37.882, Speaker E: Yeah, it was like 9924. And they use chain link oracles. So like the moment that reads on a chain link oracle, everyone's paid or rugged.
00:27:37.946 - 00:28:14.762, Speaker C: I think that's a good spot to end it. I'm really excited for you guys to listen to this interview because despite all the drama with Circle over the weekend, they are building one of the most product market fit bridges that I've ever heard of.

00:28:54.338 - 00:29:14.318, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome to our interview with Zhao Reginato. He is the VP of stablecoins over at Circle, the creators of USDC. So thanks for joining us today, Zhao. I'd love to throw it over to you, just to introduce yourself to the listeners and maybe give you a little bit of background on the origin story of Circle and how USDC fits into the crypto landscape today.
00:29:14.404 - 00:30:19.106, Speaker A: Sure. Thanks for having me, Dan. Yeah, so I've been with Circle for almost eight years at this stage, and so I have seen a lot of the evolution as a company that we have had in terms of bringing products to customers and trying to deliver on the vision that we have. And Circle was one of those companies founded ten years ago in the early days of, I think, crypto emerging as an industry. And the vision has been that how can we bring this technology to kind of transform the way that financial services have been built over the years and hopefully bring a lot more efficiency to the system and connect people around the world in ways that they haven't been connected financially and economically speaking then. And we have tried to do that in many different ways. I think for folks who have followed the industry for a little longer, Circle originally was a consumer focused company, right? So back when I joined in 2015, actually, we had a product called Circle Pay.
00:30:19.106 - 00:30:56.554, Speaker A: It was a peer to peer payments product. It was a great kind of user experience that we had at the time. It allowed you to do simple things like buy and hold bitcoin, but the main focus was peer to peer payments. So leveraging the bitcoin network to kind of transfer value globally and kind of follow the steps that I think at the time, applications like Venmo and square cash were already kind of trailing. Right. So we did that. And actually, the first thing that I did when I joined circle was to expand that product over to the european regions.
00:30:56.554 - 00:32:01.140, Speaker A: And so I launched that product in those 28, 29 markets with support for euros and pounds. And one of the things that we were doing at the time was we thought we could use bitcoin as a settlement layer, right? So every time that there were end users on our platform kind of sending funds across the regions, across the US, in Europe, or across the three currencies that we supported, or even if they were using that, obviously with bitcoin itself, we would use bitcoin as a settlement network. So if you were sending dollars to somebody in euro, we would sell those dollars into bitcoin, use that as a settlement layer, and then transform that into euros on the other end. And I think there are still a couple of companies that kind of utilize that method for cross border settlement. But obviously, after doing that for a while, we realized that there were a lot of issues with doing that. It was actually pretty cumbersome. We could hedge exposure to the volatile asset that was bitcoin at the time.
00:32:01.140 - 00:33:00.034, Speaker A: We ended up having a trade desk to kind of perform all of that operation for us, but it was expensive. While it meant that you could deal with capital in a more efficient way, there were a whole host of other problems. And then eventually we actually removed bitcoin support from the product and kind of the evolution that we saw on that, we started researching other ways of kind of implementing sort of those features that we wanted to imagine that circa 2016, with the boom around Ethereum, we actually started researching. All right, maybe what we need is to build our own token, right? What we need is to build our own settlement token. And we separated a few folks out in the company to kind of go and research that. But I think quickly after that, we navigated towards the concept of stablecoins then. And I think Jeremy Alair, our CEO, we really owe it to him and to sort of the vision.
00:33:00.034 - 00:34:04.250, Speaker A: Right. I think at the time, Jeremy and others, they made this proposal internally for us. Why don't we go ahead and build our own stablecoin? And obviously, as you can imagine in any know, Circle was still a small company at that point to kind of have this foresight and imagine, well, let's pause or sort of separate some resources out from the application and consumer product space that we were focusing on to go away and kind of build our own infrastructure because we couldn't find the best infrastructure to deliver those settlement use cases we wanted, was a bit of a daunting perspective. But that's why Jeremy is who he is. I was super fortunate to be the person on the product team that got separated out, right. And basically my mandate was go away and build the dollar stable coin, because this is going to be super useful for us for settlement use cases. And look at the success that tether was already having at that point in circuit 2017.
00:34:04.250 - 00:34:56.330, Speaker A: I went away and did that and started working with engineers to do that, obviously beginning with researching the space. But I always thought that I was going to go away, be separated a bit from the other teams, build a stable coin, and then come back to the consumer products and reintroduce that as sort of a settlement layer in the consumer products. That was what I thought was going to happen. The rest is history. We obviously built USCC and launched that in 2018, and it was so successful from the get go that I never had the chance to come back and build anything else. But I always like to sort of tell that story because I think circle has had a journey into the topic of stablecoins that's very different from a lot of journeys that a lot of companies have. Right? It was that classical.
00:34:56.330 - 00:35:11.038, Speaker A: We have some products we would love to see exist, and we have tried to build that in certain types of infrastructures. And now we realize that there's an opportunity to build a better infrastructure and that we never went back to building those consumer products.
00:35:11.204 - 00:35:39.702, Speaker C: So that's super interesting. I love the backstory. But in terms of, I guess the primary mission that you guys have had since day one, would you say that's kind of deviated from your original mission that you would have laid out a few years back? Would you say the primary use case for USDC for you guys going forward is to be used on chain or more so to integrate traditional financial rails with things like Visa and Mastercard actually settling payments on chain?
00:35:39.766 - 00:36:29.146, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question, Sam. That's also, I think, why the DNA of circo and the DNA of USCC is slightly different than other stablecoins. Because we have had that perspective when we started thinking about it. Right. But obviously, as soon as we started doing research into, okay, if we're going to build a stablecoin, what kind of a stablecoin is it going to be? Right. We started researching algo stablecoins, fiat backed stablecoins, all the options, and quickly recognized that our forte was going to be around dealing in this sort of hybrid or line that divides crypto and traditional finance, because I think circo has always played a good role in kind of connecting the two together. So the good banking partnerships we have had, the licensing infrastructure that we have had.
00:36:29.146 - 00:37:23.402, Speaker A: So leveraging all that made a lot of sense for kind of a fiat collateralized stablecoin. As I said, we have had that super mainstream high growth supporting a number of users around the world perspective to things. But when we started investigating the space, we realized, wow, stablecoins are huge right now in crypto capital markets. And in fact, at that point, crypto capital markets were, they had just kind of gone through this switching phase from going from being bitcoin denominated, right? Remember back then, pretty much all trading pairs around the world, in any crypto exchange, the major ones would be bound to bitcoin. Right? So you would trade ethereum against bitcoin and anything else against bitcoin. And all of a sudden, there was a transition there and they all became dollarized. Right.
00:37:23.402 - 00:38:01.154, Speaker A: And primarily through the growth of tether, everything became dollar denominated. Right. And so we saw that as also a huge opportunity to kind of onboard additional users through stablecoins into all those crypto use cases. And we didn't want to be a niche stablecoin, so we wanted to participate in those markets where things were already, where product market fit was already found. We started with this dual perspective, right. When we got to the point of effectively building the product and launching it we had this dual perspective. We wanted to follow these potentially, in the future, more mainstream use cases.
00:38:01.154 - 00:39:24.000, Speaker A: We wanted to use stablecoins as a way to connect to traditional finance, but we didn't want to let go of these segments where there was already product market fit. And so we have always played this dual role. And I think that's part of why USSC had the success that it had as well, because then we have seen a fairly quick adoption of USSC in crypto capital markets, especially starting with centralized exchanges and a lot of other crypto applications. But then sort of when the DFI boom kind of happened, there was a lot of adoption of USC in kind of DFI applications. But the immediate thing that I think also it's worth telling the story, the immediate thing that we focused our attention almost like the minute that we launched USC in 2018 was this idea of APIs. Right. And Circle has brought to market a lot of products that were developer focused and API driven to allow any developer in more traditional finance, but actually any developer in any application to connect with Circle's infrastructure, spin up wallets that could host USC do on and off ramping from USSC to dollars and back.
00:39:24.000 - 00:40:10.862, Speaker A: And actually we have had traditionally then a whole host of customers that utilize USC for some of those more either mainstream use cases or perhaps some use cases where people actually didn't know that they were dealing with USCC. Dapper Labs, for example, built a lot of infrastructure around wallets and how people could participate in the NFT marketplace. And most of the users did not really know that they were using USSC at of. That was part of the vision that we know there is a way for us to deliver more efficiency in all those use cases through something like USCC. But it was always kind of this dual perspective. And I think we still continue to have this dual perspective. That's why we have, I think, good relationship with the visa and the mastercards of the world.
00:40:10.862 - 00:40:38.854, Speaker A: Right? And they are experimenting with having USSC as this additional and first digital currency on their settlement layer. It will make things so much easier. People, instead of internally, between issuing banks, visa acquiring banks can, instead of be sending dollar wires back and forth, can be sending USSC transactions. It just makes it much more efficient. So I think we always have had this interest in making sure that we can cover for both.
00:40:38.972 - 00:41:34.662, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense and I appreciate the background there as well. And stablecoins have really been this killer use case of crypto. It's pretty undeniable to see the growth, especially when you look at things like market cap of some of these stablecoins outstanding, namely the fiat backed ones like USDC and USDT. But when we look at the distribution of where these stablecoins live, right, so what chains that they're on, we see circles had this pretty consistent distribution. Around 80% to 85% of USDC has been on Ethereum, whereas someone like USDT, you see that migration kind of shifting away from Ethereum and onto Tron. So with the release of the cross chain transfer protocol, CCTP, how do you think about where the most valuable location for USDC to be distributed on? And how does the chain that it's on help increase that spot demand or monetary premium for the asset?
00:41:34.726 - 00:42:27.462, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the evolution of multi chain that we have had in the last three years has been super interesting, right? And I think a blockchain like Tron was one of the earliest blockchains where you could have really fast settlement and super cheap transfers. And so I think it emerged as one of the contenders. And then particularly, it's very big in asian markets in particular, right. It's very popular over there. So I think it was a way to kind of facilitate, first of all, like sort of an intra crypto exchange kind of settlement use case. And then I think these days it is actually supporting a lot more mainstream and peer to peer and dollarization use cases. Again, specifically in Asia, we see that it is very strong in Asia.
00:42:27.462 - 00:44:14.714, Speaker A: USDC also has a pretty major component of its supply on TrOn, despite what you said, despite traditionally 80 or 85 or sometimes even more of the outstanding supply of USDC being on Ethereum. I think it's always a journey, it's always an evolution. For example, as I said, what happened with DeFi Summer and everything that happened in DeFi in general has contributed to a lot of that concentration of capital for USDC on know, because there's still a tremendous amount of capital allocated in all those markets ave compound. Look at those blue chips and they hold so much of USDC deposits from customers. But then the other thing that we notice as well, I think the safe product from Nosis, which is a very successful product as a on chain treasury instrument for businesses, right? I think the last time that I saw it had over 4000 kind of active customers holding USDC on that product with the aggregate deposit being over $4 billion worth of USCC. So that just means that all of these companies, a lot of them are dows, but a lot of them are just startups and crypto startups or startups that perhaps don't see them as crypto, but are crypto native in general that are also holding their treasury in the form of an on chain wallet in the form of USCC, which is super interesting, right. So those are obviously more on the early adopting side of businesses, but it's super interesting to see the use cases that they're conducting.
00:44:14.714 - 00:45:09.246, Speaker A: There's a lot of B, two B payments and payroll use cases there. We see a lot of VCs investing in companies, and that first kind of wire payment to the businesses is a USDC transfer. So that happens primarily on Ethereum, potentially, I think, because of how mature those products are and especially because of the security of. So that's also an evolution of what we have seen. But then, I think more recently, then the world is also changing again. Right? So we see now a lot of interest around layer twos and roll ups on Ethereum. And then besides Tron, which we referred to as one of the earlier kind of super fast and cheap alternatives in terms of layer ones, we have now then seen Solana and avalanche and a lot of those chains that are extremely interesting as well.
00:45:09.246 - 00:46:13.854, Speaker A: So we started to see a lot of interest for USDC use cases on those. The things that right now are extremely interesting for us, and I think particularly comes from the strength of the dollar, high interest rates is this dollarization use case. Last week I was at ETH Denver, I heard so many people from Latin America and some other emerging markets talking about how they are holding normal people are now holding on to USDC balances and stablecoin balances on a wallet as a way to allocate part of their capital in something that is not depreciating super fast because of inflation or something like that. And that's really interesting to see as well. And that could be one of the other cycles that we see in terms of getting crypto to be more adopted by mainstream customers. But as I said, it always comes in phases, right? It always comes being driven by a particular different part of the cycle.
00:46:13.982 - 00:46:28.470, Speaker C: So if we take a step back and kind of hone in on CCTP, can you start by explaining maybe some of the shortcomings of traditional mint and burn architectures with bridges that we see today in crypto and then maybe explain how CCTP actually differs?
00:46:28.550 - 00:47:14.086, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Circle. Actually, I think we led the way with this multichain view of the world that we have had. I think we issued USSC on a second chain starting in 2019, I believe, with Algorand, and that we follow with now we're on eight chains and soon we might be in 13 chains because it was our view of the world. We thought that these ecosystems, the way that they work, is they tend to be orthogonal in nature. So while there might be a little bit of overlap in the same applications being deployed in all these ecosystems multiple times, there's always unique innovation and unique customer and user growth that happens in those ecosystems. And we wanted to be there.
00:47:14.086 - 00:48:14.166, Speaker A: We wanted to be this digital dollar that's omnichan, and that exists everywhere. And so we started doing that. And then, I think starting in 2021, this bridge sort of segment exploded in crypto, right? And all of a sudden, it was super easy to connect all these ecosystems together. But then what we started, obviously, witnessing, which was good in many ways, because it would mean that end users, and there was end user demand, and so we could almost see where the demand was in these new ecosystems, but we started seeing a lot of these bridge solutions coming online and the way that traditionally a bridge product or a piece of infrastructure works. And actually, it's a lot more. I'll make an oversimplification here, because these are very sophisticated, usually messaging based kind of systems, right. But at a high level, the way that they work is that you sort of lock some sort of crypto asset on the source chain.
00:48:14.166 - 00:48:53.154, Speaker A: There's some sort of vault there. And the locking of that asset on the source chain emits, like, a message that somebody can trust by listening to a set of relayers or whatever on another chain, and then issue a synthetic token on the destination chain. This is usually the way that these bridges work. Right. And so they are messaging systems, but they involve locking up assets, which has been risky in some cases. And we have seen some hacks of some of these solutions in some cases. But the other thing that that approach does is that it is also what people call path dependent.
00:48:53.154 - 00:49:38.282, Speaker A: Right? So depending on which chain you're coming from and which chain you're going to like, the assets need to be locked on the source chain, and an asset needs to be issued on the destination chain. If you're coming from a slightly different chain, then the assets are locked in a different place, and so should you not issue a different asset. And so some of these solutions, they are pet dependent, and they started, in practice, fragmenting liquidity in crypto. Right. Because then you would have, I think, on Solana exempt as an anecdotal thing, because I think a lot of bridges were connecting to Solana. It was really popular. I think we ended up at some point, having eleven different synthetic versions of USSC, which was really confusing for users, confusing for developers.
00:49:38.282 - 00:50:59.310, Speaker A: A lot of people started making these mistakes, as I said, circuit 2021, we started looking a lot into that and thinking, wow, it's interesting what's happening, but it's not great for USCC, right? We don't want liquidity fragmentation. We don't want developer and user confusion. So how can we tackle that? We started to get really close with most of the bridge kind of providers out there thinking about different ways that we could solve for this. I think the cool thing about crypto is that people were super open to have these debates and discuss what were better ways to address that. But one solution that I think we very quickly got interested in is if Circo actually played a little bit of a bigger role, because USCC is a unique asset, right, in that all of the reserves are offline, they're off chain, right? So if you have a dollar in reserve, it doesn't really matter whether you have the digital version of that. Living on Solana or ethereum or avalanche, right? They're essentially equivalent. And so if you could destroy one on one chain and recreate one on another chain, provided that you can prove that the reserves are intact, that that is something that you can do with an asset like USCC that you cannot do with other crypto.
00:50:59.310 - 00:52:03.582, Speaker A: So we started thinking, okay, hold on a second. What if we build some type of infrastructure, some type of component that every bridge provider can reuse so that actually, when you move USCC from chain A to chain B, you're always going to end up with a fungible version of USCC. You're always going to end up with a native version of USCC. So everybody has the same quality properties, right? You eliminate past dependency, and almost as a byproduct, as a good byproduct, you also eliminate parts of the risk that is involved in these solutions, right? Because if you are destroying USCC on source to recreate it on destination, then you don't have to lock it up anymore. And USCC, funny enough, it is the most bridged asset in crypto just because it's dollars, right? And it makes sense for that to be the asset that you move the most. So we started seeing all these huge pockets of USCC around all these solutions, and some of them were hacked. I'm not saying all of them would eventually be hacked, but it's just a massive, massive risk for the ecosystem.
00:52:03.582 - 00:53:01.030, Speaker A: And so when we realized that we could build that and we got some feedback from the ecosystem that if we built it, they would be interested in kind of adopting, then it really made it easy for us to go away and research and build that. So as I said, CTP stands for cross chain transfer protocol. It's a mix of an on chain and off chain solution. Again, the off chain part is know if you're using USCC. The trust model for an asset like USCC already involves you trusting circle, right at the end of the day, we manage the reserves. So we thought that it wasn't going to be any detrimental to kind of also have circle as part of the flow. So the way that it happens is that you send us, a CEO on a source chain to a smart contract that receives that and kind of register the trigger that somebody wants to move that to a different chain.
00:53:01.030 - 00:54:07.158, Speaker A: Circle has an attestation service that it runs basically that is monitoring all those smart contracts. If you come to that service and you ask for a proof that, you know, a particular transfer has happened on one of those source contracts, circuan can issue an attestation saying yes, we believe that that transfer has happened and we signed that transfer. We signed that attestation in such a way that if you bring that attestation then to another chain, to the destination chain, to another smart contract and you, you know, there is a proof here it was signed by circle that there was a transfer on this source chain. Then USCC can be reminted on that destination chain. So it effectively allows you to almost physically move USCC from the source chain to the destination chain. That's what CTP allows for. And as I said, the thing that we have loved is that most bridging and messaging infrastructures, axelar wormhole layer zero, like all of these guys aggregators, they're all basically integrating with CTP.
00:54:07.158 - 00:54:16.782, Speaker A: And USCC will have that experience for users of those protocols, of those services from the get go as soon as we bring it to market.
00:54:16.916 - 00:55:21.998, Speaker B: I love the analogy you made there. Know, if you have, let's say USDC on avalanche and like they are equivalent, but they just missed that piece of fungibility, right? You can't actually hold those two assets in the same hand until CCTP. And I also love the idea of removing the bridge risk by all these bridges use LPs and LPs come deposit liquidity and that's what enables a lot of these transfers. But this model completely strips that because the USDC would be destroyed on the source chain and minted freshly and newly issued on the destination chain. And what's interesting there is the use of these cross chain messaging protocols. As you mentioned, layer zero, wormhole axlar, would circle ever consider building out that piece of the infrastructure as well? Because ultimately, my understanding is that is the piece that delivers the message between the chains. So while circle actually has the contracts that does the minting and the burning, it's kind of using a third party technology for the actual communication between those two chains.
00:55:22.094 - 00:55:57.150, Speaker A: Yeah, no, at least not now, Dan. At least the perspective. And we have worked with these folks for a long time, and we were very careful because we wanted to make sure that people understood the reason why we were building this. I think very early internally we said, yeah, but what are we doing here? Do we want to be in the business of bridging? And I think very quickly we said no to that. So you will not see a front end. CCP does not have a front end. It's not supposed to be a Dap also, that can be used directly by consumers.
00:55:57.150 - 00:56:43.818, Speaker A: We have had a developer first mindset for a lot of things that we have been doing for the last two or three years. And so we thought that was also going to be the case here, that we would build actually something that is more of a protocol, really focused on collaborating with all these, whether they are messaging services, bridge providers, but also aggregators, sometimes even wallet providers as well, at large scale, they want to connect directly with these services. But the point for us is to be like a developer platform that these folks are primarily the customers of. We don't see ourselves actually building the entire kind of bridge solution and facing counterparties directly. That's not the focus that we have.
00:56:43.904 - 00:57:18.830, Speaker C: Yeah, I just always marvel at how good of a business you guys have, because in a rising interest rate environment in crypto, that's usually pretty bad, but for you guys, it's actually pretty good. So I guess my question to you would be, do you think that you will monetize the issuance of USDC, like going across different chains with fees directly provided to maybe the Dapps that are utilizing your services, or is really the ultimate goal just to grow the USDC supply so that way you can make more interest revenue on the back end with your cash and cash equivalents holdings.
00:57:18.930 - 00:57:44.610, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great point, Sam. And it is interesting, right? Because at the same time, right now, yes, the business is a great business. It's a very valuable business. But when we launched USC in 2018, interest rates were basically zero. So it's interesting to see how quickly things change. It's only been five years, right? I think we appreciate that. Yes.
00:57:44.610 - 00:58:45.406, Speaker A: While USCC is a super valuable business, we cannot rely just on net income from reserves. There has to be something different than that as well. That's why I think we have so much of a focus on also seeing ourselves as a platform for developers, right? We try to provide for everything that a developer, particularly in a financial service space, but also in adjacent areas like gaming. Like a lot of other things, I share that vision that eventually I think we will see. Just as we ended up with browsers, web browsers on most of the apps that we use on our phones, I think you will have digital wallets on most of the apps that you have on your phone, right? If you just think about the fact that there is a dollar sign and a balance in a lot of apps that people don't think of as wallets. Your Uber is a wallet, your Airbnb is a wallet, all of these things are wallets. And there's not a lot of reasons.
00:58:45.406 - 00:59:19.726, Speaker A: We know the reasons, but eventually we think there are going to be good reasons for those to become digital wallets and just be more interoperable with this whole ecosystem. I think we focus a lot on that. We want that world to happen, but when that world happens, hopefully we will be able to monetize other types of services. Right. That can be more transactional in nature. To your point, does that mean something like CTP could have fees in the future? It will not have. To begin with, it will not have.
00:59:19.726 - 01:00:06.750, Speaker A: But I see a world where interest rates change in this way or the other. Bridging cost becomes a little bit more standardized or commoditized. I see a world where that could happen. But we don't look only at CCTP for that. I think, as I said, we have a broader perspective. Yes, interest rates make reserves for USCC valuable today, but as a business, as any other business, we have to have a more varied perspective into the future. And we have a lot of plans for additional developer services that we are going to build, wallet infrastructures, additional business services, and all of those would be monetized in and of itself, but also being supported by USCC for sure.
01:00:06.820 - 01:00:18.190, Speaker B: So is the use of CTP permissionless? Or if I'm a user or a protocol, would I be interacting directly with those third party providers, those axilars, wormholes, layer zeros?
01:00:18.270 - 01:00:51.760, Speaker A: I think as a user, our expectation and our recommendation is that all users would be much better served by going directly to those kinds of services. Right? And even, I think there's already a lot of aggregation happening on top of bridging. Right. And then even there are wallets that connect to those either the bridges directly or the aggregation services. And so you see yourself as more of a wallet user. Perhaps you don't see yourself as a bridge user. So I think that will be the case.
01:00:51.760 - 01:01:25.286, Speaker A: The smart contracts and the attestation service, those things are permissionless, right? So anybody can use them. It's going to be absolutely kind of free for everyone to use. But I think those things are pretty complicated. It is a pretty complicated workflow, even though it sounds simple. Steps one, two and three, you finish those three steps and you get it. But actually hooking up those steps, it requires a little bit of sophistication, certainly some bit of coding. So I think that's why naturally it will be mostly used by develop.
01:01:25.388 - 01:02:02.210, Speaker B: And as far as the integration process goes, I know the original plans were Ethereum first and then looking into Avalanche and Solana. And I was just curious where the cosmos ecosystem fits into this. Right? Because I know DyDX is launching DyDx chain, an app specific chain out in that ecosystem, and they really want to use USDC as their base asset for deposits and withdrawals. So how do you think about bringing USDC into the cosmos? And how has the change in Noble, the general asset issuance chains over there? How has the change in Noble's use of interchange security played a role in that, if at all?
01:02:02.280 - 01:02:40.062, Speaker A: Yeah, we have been super excited about Cosmos as an ecosystem for years now, and I keep talking to folks on the cosmos ecosystem again last week was chatting to some. It took us a lot longer to figure out the best path to serve that ecosystem than otherwise. But it's also because I think cosmos as an ecosystem, it is as decentralized as it gets. Right. There's so many different teams, and you really have to kind of listen to a lot of those perspectives. And it's so rich in that. The first part of your question.
01:02:40.062 - 01:03:27.022, Speaker A: Yes, the plan continues to be the first route that we have already implemented, and we're just finalizing security audits and all that good stuff is connecting Ethereum and avalanche. And so that's the first route that we're going to bring to market, hopefully at some point in the next month or so. And then we would like to follow very quickly with, first of all, most of the EVM compatible chains that we have USCC on, because that's pretty kind of straightforward once we have built it on Ethereum. Right. It's a little bit easier to deploy an EVM compatible chains. I think outside of those, we will probably be very soon on Solana as well. But Cosmos, by all means will be the next will be important.
01:03:27.022 - 01:04:07.894, Speaker A: And by being next, I don't know. We will have to wait necessarily. I hope we can, after a little bit of time experimenting and observing the operation of CCTP on this initial route. I think we'll try to be quick in terms of covering the other versions of USCC. But yes, then getting to Cosmos, we will absolutely connect the bridge to Cosmos. We think it's going to be super important in the vision that we have for USCC as part of Cosmos. We have landed on this design after working with the teams there for many, many years, that there should be sort of this asset issuance chain.
01:04:07.894 - 01:05:03.070, Speaker A: It is the term that we have used as well in many of these discussions, sort of a neutral kind of app chain, right? Or at least an app chain where its goal is to basically be the port of entry for assets. And in talking to the teams, we eventually found this team that also had a similar vision and they went away and built Noble. And it's already in Testnet, and hopefully it's going to be launched on mainet pretty soon. The vision was obviously to have that port of entry on Cosmos and through know connect that to basically all the cosmos chains. That's the vision that we have for how USCC will get to DyDX as an app chain as well. So CCTP will connect to Noble as the port of entry for Cosmos. And from then on, you can ibc it into basically the entire Cosmos ecosystem where IBC is enabled.
01:05:03.070 - 01:05:37.334, Speaker A: I think we're aligned between ourselves, Noble, the Dydx team, that that is the path. Obviously, we're all interested in connecting CTP, connecting the bridge to Noble, to Cosmos, because then Cosmos can have. Sorry. DyDX has a pretty interesting upgrade path for their existing users. Right. And how to very seamlessly kind of move those funds over into the new chain and all that. And we are absolutely committed to supporting them.
01:05:37.334 - 01:06:26.854, Speaker A: I think it's fair to say that one of the key reasons why we have prioritized bringing new sec to Cosmos was once we realized and once we learned that DyDx was building their own app chain. So Dydx is a huge use case for USCC. They have always had this huge commitment to USCC, and we have all the intention to continue to support them in what they want to build. I think the interchange security part of what you mentioned, it is a super complicated thing, and I think we also didn't want that to kind of delay the bringing of USCC to Cosmos. So we found a path. We will start with noble being a proof of authority chain, and we see an upgrade path into eventually leveraging interchange security. So we're kind of comfortable with the roadmap and how it looks.
01:06:26.854 - 01:06:41.900, Speaker A: And as I said, the main thing is that I am so excited. I think it's fair to say that it is one of the versions of USCC that I'm most excited about and lightening up that whole ecosystem and can't wait to see that happening in the next couple of months.
01:06:42.450 - 01:07:26.070, Speaker C: Yeah, Cosmos has definitely been missing a stable coin that's super reliable, that's fungible across all of its different chains. So that's super exciting to hear. When I think about the CCTP design, I think about IBC and interchange accounts and other applications kind of building on top of the smart contracts you deploy and then kind of making cross chain transactions more atomic, if you will. So, for example, a borrowing and lending protocol on avalanche, but you're a user on Ethereum, you send USDC into that borrowing and lending protocol on avalanche in order to earn yield. Is that something that you expect to happen? And what other use cases are you expecting to come out of CCTP?
01:07:26.150 - 01:08:18.694, Speaker A: Yeah, no, absolutely, Sam. I think actually, it's almost hard to imagine the ways that people are going to be able to leverage this. But I think organically, I think maybe we wrote this in some marketing material at some point, but it's funny that people started to use that term. People started talking about this idea of composable USCC, and it came from when we were writing about CCTP and the fact that all of a sudden you actually have an objective and programmable way to deal with USCC across chain. Right. Because of what you said. Because I can actually write code that expects a deposit of USCC from somewhere else and then I can take action once I see particular triggers on a different chain.
01:08:18.694 - 01:09:14.874, Speaker A: I think the Axelr team in particular has a very good vision for this. They have just announced more good developer tools like last week at Denver as well, to just provide developers with this ability to have this master dashboard that is cross chain in nature and allows you to observe all these events across chains. I think what you described, somebody on some sort of a capital market, on Cosmos, taking deposits from other chains, I think that's absolutely something that people will be able to do. I think a lot of swapping of assets, if you think about it, the evolution of multiple chains has been super interesting, but one of the not so good things that it causes is the fragmentation of liquidity. Right. If I have one asset on one chain, but I want to swap that for an asset on a different chain. There is no market today for trading those assets.
01:09:14.874 - 01:09:48.534, Speaker A: Right. I typically have to combine like a hop to another chain and then hope that the liquidity of that asset on the destination chain is also as good as it needs to be and then perform the swap on one chain. Right. But maybe there is now an opportunity specifically for USDC. And I think it makes sense because the dollars are the basis of a lot of these markets, right. So it makes sense for you to have a hop onto dollars, but I think it will allow developers to hopefully be a lot more creative. There's not going to be as much counterparty risk as before.
01:09:48.534 - 01:10:36.486, Speaker A: Right. So if you trust, as I said, if you're using USC in a way you have to trust circle, you have to trust that at least we are managing the reserves. So hopefully the hop to using CCTP, for example, doesn't impact the perceived price of USCC due to counterparty risk because it's mostly the same and that allows people to kind of build applications that rely more on that kind of infrastructure. And yeah, I think that's our whole bet is that by putting this type of infrastructure in place, it will create like another wave of innovation. And I think we already see again last week we were having demos of some developers showing to us what they can do with CTP. And it's mind blowing. It's really creative stuff.
01:10:36.588 - 01:11:03.466, Speaker B: When I think about unlocks from CTP, I think this is like a huge potential UX improvement for wallet providers, right? Because from my wallet, I would love the ability to move funds from chain A to chain B. And so I'm curious if any wallet providers are kind of like in early talks with you guys and saying like, hey, we'd love to integrate CTP to simplify the UX of wallets. Because one of the things I consistently think about is how can we make crypto easier to onboard users.
01:11:03.578 - 01:11:57.170, Speaker A: Yes, we have a lot of wallet providers interested in this one. I think evolution that we think can happen is that for some of these assets that are essentially omnichan like USSC, because I have many multi chain wallets, right, where because I do all these tests, I know it sounds like a sickness or something, but I actually hold USCC in the form of many different chain versions on the same wallet just to check the user experience. And it's kind of not great. I have to be honest, it's far from great because you end up with multiple dollar balances, right? So you can easily have in some of these wallets three USCC balances, right? Because you have sent them from different chains. I think. Think about it, that now with something like CTP, there is an opportunity for you to improve the user experience and say, no, you have $1 balance. Because we support, at least to the extent that they support, they connect to all these routes.
01:11:57.170 - 01:12:44.402, Speaker A: It doesn't matter which USC you send to, we're going to be holding that version, obviously, under the hood. Like that's the asset that you actually have. But we can amalgamate those balances, right? Because if you need them to do, let's say you have 50 USSC on Salana and 100 USSC on Ethereum, but you want to send 125 on Ethereum, right. There is now the chance for you to build a user experience that sort of abstract away all the complicated stuff that's happening behind the scenes and they can bridge it and do something like that. I think we have some wallet providers interested in kind of evolving UXs in that way. It might take a while. I think the beginning will probably be an evolution of the existing experiences they have.
01:12:44.402 - 01:12:59.414, Speaker A: So maybe now you can actually intentionally bridge USCC in this new way through the wallet UI. But I think this idea of having a dollar balance that is slightly more useful. I think we'll see that coming.
01:12:59.532 - 01:13:14.300, Speaker C: I've got to ask you, just because I know circle and Coinbase have relationships that go back kind of towards the more beginning of your inception. So what do you think about base? Are you excited about it? Have you talked to their team about potential integrations with CCTP on?
01:13:14.990 - 01:13:45.330, Speaker A: We have. I think Coinbase did a great job with the announcement. I think they also did a great job know coming to the ecosystem and involving the ecosystem and making everybody excited. And we, as the issues of USSC, we are part of that as well. Yeah, we're talking to their team. There's a lot of cool things I think we could do together, but nothing yet ready to announce, but certainly a good collaboration that we're having.
01:13:45.400 - 01:13:45.634, Speaker B: Great.
01:13:45.672 - 01:13:56.262, Speaker C: Well, Dan, if you don't have any other questions, Zhao's already been super generous with his time, so I don't know if you want to share with the audience where they can find you on Twitter or learn more about circle. I'll kick it over to you for that.
01:13:56.316 - 01:14:25.502, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. No, I love Twitter. I'm a big city Twitter user. You can find me on Reginato, my last name Reginatto. And yeah, as I said, we have a strong developer focus. I'm always interested in talking to developers, people who are interested in building applications and connecting to USSC in some shape or form. If you guys are interested in CTP as well, I'm your name.
01:14:25.502 - 01:14:29.118, Speaker A: Please reach out via Twitter or some other channel and we're happy to talk.
01:14:29.204 - 01:14:31.020, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks so much zia. We'll have to do this again.
