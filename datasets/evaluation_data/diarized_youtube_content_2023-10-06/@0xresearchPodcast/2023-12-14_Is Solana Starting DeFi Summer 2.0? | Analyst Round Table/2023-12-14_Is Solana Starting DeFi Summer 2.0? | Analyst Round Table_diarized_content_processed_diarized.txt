00:00:00.410 - 00:00:04.602, Speaker A: This is what Ethereum did three years ago in, in DFI summer.
00:00:04.666 - 00:00:05.182, Speaker B: This is.
00:00:05.236 - 00:00:43.980, Speaker A: This is what the start looked like, right? It was mostly just poking around, like, playing with apps that you probably don't necessarily want to, like lever three x long on a certain DFI asset on Salana right now, but you're just, like, executing transactions and playing around and, like, throwing $30 in a liquidity pool or something. If you fast forward long enough to that world that you described, where there was all these things that are happening on Solana that cannot happen on other chains, and it was like this rich experience where so many things that you're playing games on Solana and you were doing X, Y, and Z, social apps, whatever it is, how would that all start? And my answer would be, it would probably look a lot like what's happening right now.
00:00:46.430 - 00:01:10.142, Speaker C: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. If you're listening to this podcast, there's a good chance that, like Dan and I, you believe the future of finance is on the blockchain. And we're excited that London is becoming a global hub for blockchain innovation and institutional adoption of digital assets. That's why we're pumped to host the 2024 Digital Asset Summit in London this March. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. Later in this episode, we'll tell you how you can save 20% off on your ticket.
00:01:10.206 - 00:01:35.818, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We got an analyst episode lined up for you today. We are recording on December 11, and we are joined by Ren and Brick from the Blockworks research team. All of us spend all day, every day, working towards building a better blockworks research. So be sure to check out what we've built at app blockworksresearch.com. And if you're looking to get a subscription, we have a discount code running for you. Zero X research.
00:01:35.818 - 00:01:51.006, Speaker A: Ten all caps. That'll get you 10% off an annual subscription at checkout. So we got a good episode lined up today. We've got governance updates and a classic game, a hot seat cool throne. Sam, you want to get us moving, man? I know you got some good governance updates queued up for.
00:01:51.188 - 00:02:50.254, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So the first one I actually just saw this morning, cryptochndom, tweeted about Rollbit's proposal to switch from a buy and burn to a rev share model, which is pretty interesting considering how much revenue they actually generate. It would be like a one year lockup, and the logic there is you want a long lockup needed to ensure that the APY stays pretty high and looks really attractive, thus providing a Florida prices I imagine what the motivation is and there are two options for claiming theoretically if this gets implemented. So you can either compound the revenue into more RLB that's auto locked, thus increasing your pro rotator share of the stake weight and revenue. Or you could do a 90% cash claim which is uploaded into your account is what it sounds like, and then 5% of that will go to a uniswap LP locked as sell side liquidity and 5% more for buy side liquidity. So pretty interesting mechanism here. You can also unlock early for a penalty, so you'll basically get slashed and the RLB that you forfeit will be burned.
00:02:50.254 - 00:02:58.280, Speaker C: So still have a little bit of that burn mechanism in place as well by default. So thought this one was pretty cool. What do you guys think?
00:02:58.650 - 00:03:49.910, Speaker B: I think it's an interesting proposal, given that historically there have been a lot of concerns around Robbie. We haven't really seen the buyback and burn do its thing yet. I think people were projecting like 20 30% of the supply was going to be burned over the past year, but price is still kind of flat over the past few months. So hopefully this will inject some life into robot and the whole entire gambling sector. I am still slightly skeptical that robit is a bit sketch because a few people on CTF pointed out that their numbers are just so much higher than the closest sort of gambling protocol competitor. But I do think gambling protocols in general are one of the long term winners. As crypto as degenerate, that's something you can't fade.
00:03:50.810 - 00:04:24.358, Speaker A: Whenever I hear about revenue distribution programs, it's something I want to write a report on at some point. But the most efficient way to do that is it's non trivial. Especially if you're like a Dex. I know the guys over at curve think a lot about how their protocol captures fees, then collects them, so actually puts them in one spot and then distributes them. It's not just like as simple as it seems, especially when the fees are quite large and in the context of curve, they're in various different assets. So there's a lot of swapping that needs to go on. So a, you got to pay fees on those swappings, and b, you can't get sandwiched on those or else you're losing fees.
00:04:24.358 - 00:04:55.850, Speaker A: So it's like this really complex thing of actually turning on a fee switch, which is definitely not spoken about a ton. So whenever I think of a revenue distribution mechanism. It's pretty interesting in the context of rollbit. I like what they're doing with the cash claim going into your account. If I was a gambling protocol, that is definitely what I would do is give the gamblers more money directly in their accounts. That takes an extra step to take off. It's still giving it to you, just putting it in your account so then you can withdraw and access it.
00:04:55.850 - 00:05:15.570, Speaker A: Right. But on a gambling platform, what do you have as users? Gamblers. So it definitely makes sense to kind of help keep that stickiness there. And I'm sure a lot of that revenue ends up kind of getting pumped right back in. So really well designed there. I think you said the first half was like a buyback and burn, is that right, Sam?
00:05:16.870 - 00:05:27.986, Speaker C: Yes. Instead of buybacking and burning, it's going to compound in a more RLB token, so then your stake weight is just increased, so therefore your pro audit share.
00:05:28.008 - 00:05:29.654, Speaker D: Of the rewards each week will go up.
00:05:29.772 - 00:05:56.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't love buyback and burn. It seems like something that works great in something, a super efficient market, like, say, the stock market, where all you're doing is changing the denominator of shares outstanding and the fair value remains unchanged, and so the price actually flows back to the holders. But in super inefficient markets, like most of crypto, if not all of crypto, I don't know if it's just as effective. So cool to see that they kind of pivoted away from that, too.
00:05:56.930 - 00:06:18.440, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like rollbit is, like, one of the most controversial topics in crypto, to be completely honest. Like, you either absolutely hate it and think it's complete forest and they're making up the numbers and it's going to be insolvent any day now, or you're like a mega bull on it. So I don't really know where I lie, to be completely honest. Brick, I know you said you're a little bit skeptical of the revenue numbers. Would you double down on that, do you think?
00:06:19.610 - 00:07:06.398, Speaker D: Yeah, it's tough to say, of course. I'm just speculating. But it's weird that you have somebody who has such a, or a protocol that has such a sticky customer base and who create so much, I don't know, gambling volume or trading volume compared to other platforms. And even when other platforms try and acquire customers through different kinds of schemes, a, either they don't reach even close to those numbers that rollbit has, or b, the customers aren't sticky at all, then they just bounce away. So that kind of makes me worried in that sense, but at the same time, I don't really have any proof about there being any funny business going on on rollbit. So at the end of the day, I'm just speculating.
00:07:06.574 - 00:07:33.434, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I feel you, though. I thought, winner whiner protocol. I don't even know how you pronounce it, but that arbitrum stip recipient would see a huge boost in volume because they got like half a million to $750,000 of Arb tokens to them. And the numbers on that thing is still just flat. I don't know why people aren't using them. It makes me highly skeptical of the rollbit numbers, but I guess we'll see. Ren, I know you got a good update on Lara V two, so I'll kick it over to you.
00:07:33.552 - 00:08:19.674, Speaker B: I do. Lira V two is coming in hot. They recently passed the governance, adoption, and sustainability vote that basically includes an incentive program with 150,000,000 units worth of the Lyra token over 24 months. They bootstrap Lyra chain and V two of the protocol, similar to DyDX's incentive program. And they have an ongoing vote ending on December 13 for the deployment of the Lyra V two, which includes deploying the chain, the protocol, and the exchange, which are kind of all like separate things. But for simple sakes, just think of it as they're going to deploy this whole crazy options exchange on opsack roll up. So, yeah, the foundation is going to fund a security model, and once that goes live, V two mainet and the incentives will start.
00:08:19.674 - 00:09:05.130, Speaker B: I think that token hasn't been doing particularly well over the past year. This could be a catalyst, but I will say that the perptex space is very competitive right now, especially with Dydx incentives kicking in, and you're seeing sort of good volume there. And also, Avo is an op stack roll up. Libra V two is going to be an op stack roll up. So the question is going to be like, why should I use Avo versus Libra V two? And I think that remains to be seen. They do have some very cool architectural developments surrounding their order book, but, yeah, just wanted to put this out there. I would say some other just random governance updates you should be paying attention to.
00:09:05.130 - 00:09:41.990, Speaker B: One is the orca fee switch. That one passed, I think, maybe one or two weeks ago. I'm not sure what is implemented already, but given that Orca is one of the largest spot dexes in Salana, chances are it's going to be like a pretty decent amount of revenue. And another one is Cowsoft's fee switch. They're sort of debating different fee switch modules, and cow token is at 44 million market cap. And it's kind of like one of the only tokens you have if you want to get exposure to an intense space protocol. And I know I personally don't like the word intense that much.
00:09:41.990 - 00:10:02.490, Speaker B: I kind of feel like it's like a vc term that everyone just walked around with. But eventually it's going to cast a narrative and everybody's going to be really hyped about intense, just like how at some point everybody's going to be really hyped about coprocessors, even though no one really knows what it is. So, yeah, just putting that on your radar. I'll pass it back to you, Sam.
00:10:02.930 - 00:10:12.830, Speaker C: Yeah, no, those were all solid. I'm curious though, are you bullish on Lyra V two, or do you think the space, I guess, is just getting a little diluted?
00:10:13.650 - 00:10:40.680, Speaker B: I think the space is getting pretty diluted. I think Ava has done a good job with their perps, their pre launch futures. That seems to be coming a big trend. And I do think pre launch futures will just continue to grow in magnitude during a bull market. Everyone just wants to ape the airdrop before the airdrop comes. Especially if you didn't get the airdrop, for example, like layer zero tease that they're considering. Like a token airdrop in Q one 2024.
00:10:40.680 - 00:11:12.014, Speaker B: Assuming you faded Larry Zero, and you didn't from the living shit out of it, chances are you might want to get some exposure through prelaunch futures. Right? Sure, liquidity isn't the best, but I do think there's pretty good product market fit for pre launch futures. So yeah, I'm not sure entirely about just like options exchange. And one more thing. I want to buy options on sort of tokens that I think are going to go up over the next one or two years. For example, like Solana. I would love to buy like a leap on Solana.
00:11:12.014 - 00:11:31.270, Speaker B: We have an expiry that's like two years out, but those don't exist. The best expiry you can get is maybe like one month. So yeah, I think the perks face is pretty diluted already, and the options is even more competitive just because there's so much less users and there's very strong network effects like options exchange.
00:11:32.890 - 00:12:10.454, Speaker A: The AVo thing, the pre launch future specifically is really cool, man. I know we talked about this a bit an episode or two ago, so I don't want to dive too deep on it. But I thought it was really impressive how that was where price discovery happened for Jito before the token successfully launched, they pretty much nailed the kickoff price. And that was pretty interesting because I was looking, trying to do some comparisons to see how accurate it would be. And just the one that I quickly looked at at the time was, say, the, say, token launch. And that one actually looked like it was not accurate at all. But I don't know enough about how the, say, token launched or what that process looked like to really.
00:12:10.454 - 00:12:28.234, Speaker A: And I also think that was the first Avo pre launch futures, the first token they supported. So also don't want to really use the first one as a base case here, but using the Jito one as a base case. And again, super solid sample size. But I think if it works, that's really cool.
00:12:28.432 - 00:12:50.622, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. The key is just going to be getting enough liquidity there because I know there was very little liquidity to actually utilize for the Jito launch. But I know hyperliquid is doing this too. But nonetheless, I totally agree with you, Dan. I think pre launch futures for sure will find product market fit. It's just a matter of where most of the volume occurs. But moving on a little bit, arbitram has a proposal live to do a research and development collective.
00:12:50.622 - 00:13:19.226, Speaker C: I know you guys probably remember the listeners, us kind of talking about our original proposal. So basically we wanted, or the DAO wanted it to be more of an RFP process. So unfortunately, ours did not pass. But we're super excited to see this moving forward. We think it's a great initiative and much needed. We think that there needs to be research conducted on governance related things in order to educate delegates, do analysis from the economic risk standpoint, et cetera. There's so many different use cases for a body like this.
00:13:19.226 - 00:13:39.540, Speaker C: So the vote live right now is to fund a six month term for the collective of 880,000 ARB, 1.3 million ARB, or 1.7 million ARB for a six month term. So we'll see if that marches forward. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Or have we kind of beaten this one like a dead horse or whatever the saying is?
00:13:41.270 - 00:14:20.640, Speaker D: I think I've seen some interesting or interesting comments connected to that where people still want to see some changes to the proposal that's going up or is up right now, where they want to have the salaries or the amounts paid to the different service providers to be even more better defined, such that one entity can't just slack off and still get paid the full amount, and I think that's been historically a pretty important part to get right when you do these kind of dow funding things, which I thought was super interesting.
00:14:21.810 - 00:15:10.874, Speaker B: Yeah, I would just add on that I think more so now than when we first talked about this arbitrage coalition idea that's probably needed the idea of this research sort of coalition, for lack of a better term, because you're seeing proposals left and right, and they're really wide ranging. Right. There's one proposal introducing ARb as gas that came in like 6 hours ago. I know Matt and our team talked about deploying the ARB treasury into rwAs, and then you have incentivizing delegates backfunding. Like it's getting maybe not so nice, but it's getting a little out of control, in my opinion. It feels like people are just randomly proposing things left and right. I don't think the community is going to do a really well informed vote.
00:15:10.874 - 00:15:28.114, Speaker B: If, for example, introducing Arvis gas, if that goes to a vote, and that has pretty important ramifications for arbitram as a token and arbitram as an ecosystem, you really don't want to just be like aping that vote. So, yeah, I think it's pretty needed right now.
00:15:28.312 - 00:15:45.674, Speaker C: Yeah, and your costs are denominated in eth. So at some point you've got know, pay the. So like a lot of research needs to be done on that. You just got like random people proposing these on the forum. It's like, maybe we should take a step back and look at this a little deeper. So I definitely agree with you. There's some crazy shit going on in the arbitram forums these days.
00:15:45.674 - 00:16:24.002, Speaker C: But actually that reminds me too. We've got that arbitrum staking proposal that did pass, so I'm not sure exactly what the implementation timeline is on that, but I assume that is something worth paying close attention to. So we'll get you an update on that next week, but moving on to the next proposal. And this is our last one for the week, but synthetics is voting to launch on base, remove SNX inflation, as well as implement an SNX buyback program where it'll be burned, and it's 50% of fees going to this buyback and burn ordeal. So you can definitely see this in SNX price action. People are getting pretty excited. That thing was held under $3 for quite some time and finally broke out over the weekend.
00:16:24.002 - 00:16:32.170, Speaker C: So this definitely feels like the next catalyst for SNX and a really good direction for the protocol. In my opinion. But do you guys have any thoughts?
00:16:32.510 - 00:17:05.126, Speaker A: Yeah, Govhub users are the winners here because I think that was in our platform. Sorry about. I don't know if it was like a month ago, Westy was all over that one, so props to him there as well. Yeah, I mean, that's huge. Synthetics has been leveraging their token inflation to bootstrap the staking side of their protocol, and it's worked and it's kind of achieved what it needed to do. So now it makes sense to turn it off. Right? You're a mature product, and that's kind of what the natural evolution of these things was supposed to look like when we started doing this back in 2020, 2021.
00:17:05.126 - 00:17:24.870, Speaker A: And so to see that actually come to fruition, even just like two, three years later, is really damn cool. This is what progress is supposed to look like. That market seems to be reacting as if that's the case too, which is cool to see. So, yeah, congrats to the synthetics team. That's pretty cool to kind of hit this milestone.
00:17:24.950 - 00:18:20.662, Speaker C: All right, Zero X research listeners, we're calling on you to join us for the premier institutional crypto conference in Europe's crypto capital, London this March 2024. You're going to get to hear exclusive insights from industry trailblazers on things like leveraging d five protocols for institutional yield, tokenizing real world assets with instant settlement, navigating the evolving global regulatory landscape, integrating digital assets into banking and payments, or crafting institutional investment mandates with digital assets as the key focus. We'll also be featuring some big keynote speakers, including Melvin Dang, the CEO at QCP Capital, Mark Yusco, the CEO and managing partner of Morgan Creek Capital, and Stani Kluchin, the founder and CEO of Ave Companies. This is not an event you're going to want to miss. Seats are limited, so be sure to register today by hitting the link in the description and using promo code Zero X 20 to save 20% on your ticket. See you in London, the land of tasty pastries. And be sure to hit up Dan and I for a beer.
00:18:20.662 - 00:18:25.920, Speaker C: I think that's a good time to move it over to hot seat cool throne. Ren, do you want to kick it off for us?
00:18:28.690 - 00:18:55.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll hijack Ren's. We got a tag team one this week, so we are going to put Solana in the cool throne. And honestly, how it ended up here was because there are so many reasons for Solana to be living in the cool throne this week. So I'll hit the first litany of things and then I'll let Ren take it away. But first and foremost, the Jito airdrop. Man, that was really cool to see. Jito basically airdropped a new car to all of its users.
00:18:55.346 - 00:19:26.866, Speaker A: The token ran up, launched at about $192, ran up to about 440 or so. So the airdrops were between. Let's use the launch price of about $2. Every recipient got between ten and $200,000. That is absolutely insane. This really does feel like a momentum driver for the entire ecosystem. The COO of Judo labs, Brian, he put out a pretty cool thread that was just like a reflection of the day at the end of the release day or launch day.
00:19:26.866 - 00:20:03.406, Speaker A: And it was really cool because he mentioned how many teams all were working together to make this a flawless token launch. And that is exactly what it was. There was dexes, there was sexes, lending markets, even wallet apps were all on the same page for that exact day, that exact moment token goes live. It's easy to access, and most importantly, the chain hummed along without a single problem. So Netnet, it was just really cool to see that there was actually. I wish I could find this thread, but it was by a cosmos developer. I want to say it was related to the Tia token launch, but I'm not positive on that.
00:20:03.406 - 00:21:09.426, Speaker A: But basically this developer was saying it's really hard to get a perfect launch of a new product, a token, whatever it may be, because you need so many teams to all be prioritizing that event, which every team is doing different things, like where this event falls on their prioritization table, is going to be different. Right? And so it's just like thinking about a little bit more separate or lack of connection in an ecosystem, like a series of app chains versus something like Solana, which is all about atomic composability on one single layer. It's really cool to kind of see the teams we're working together and when there's so much infighting going on in the industry right now, this was just so refreshing for me personally. So congrats to Jito team. We launched a podcast with Lucas. By the time this comes out, it'll be yesterday, so be sure to check that out. We really dove deep on again, just like how they operate on the mev side of things, because there's so much innovation going on there, as well as this thing called Stakenet, which I'll let you listen to that episode to get an idea what stakenet is.
00:21:09.426 - 00:21:51.866, Speaker A: But why I want to bring it up is because what they're doing in this is putting three years of validator history directly on using Lucas's words were, we're using Solana as the database. And so why I love that so much is because we are seeing the exact opposite narrative from the Ethereum community, where fees are expensive as shit. And that is something that has to be dealt with. And the response has been, let's just push that off chain. In a lot of use cases, that's fine, maybe it works or delivers a better product. Like an example of that would be uniswap x, right? They do computation off chain, find a filler and boom, you've got a better order than what you would have had. That's net positive for the user.
00:21:51.866 - 00:22:32.698, Speaker A: But then this kind of keeps cascading, and it's like, where do you stop? And now there's discussion around removing events. And events basically tell you what occurred in a transaction, and they are emitted only to communicate with the user. And there's a huge discussion around moving these off chain. And so basically what that's doing is giving less information to the user about what happened in their transaction and making data analysis much harder. And to me, as a data analyst, that is a little antithetical to the idea of blockchains being transparent. And I know super low level engineers are going to be like, you're an idiot. That's not what's happening at all.
00:22:32.698 - 00:23:00.166, Speaker A: And that's true on a technical level. All of the data, transaction data is still on chain, and you can replay those off chain and get the same results. I get that. But on a practical level, data analysis and building things, an understanding of what's happening on chain is all done for EVM. Chains is all done through events. That is how it works today. And so, yes, we can pivot and change all that, but do we really want to be pushing all this off chain? It just doesn't make a ton of sense to me.
00:23:00.166 - 00:23:39.794, Speaker A: So it's very refreshing to see Solana being like, nah, we've built a system where fees are so cheap, we can literally use the chain as a database for three years of validator performance history. And they're going to use that to do this really cool thing, which, again, I'll let you dive into the Jito episode for that. But again, so what Solana is doing is seeming to work. And I think people are catching on, because another reason we have them in the cool throne this week is priority fees are making an all time high. So the weekly values close every Sunday night. So we just set a new all time high of 250k in weekly priority fees. So still peanuts on a relative dollar value.
00:23:39.794 - 00:24:17.034, Speaker A: But the chart is just absolutely up into the right. It's about a new all time high by like 40 or so percent. And it's really just proving that users want transaction inclusion and are willing to pay for it, which is kind of a very important piece of the puzzle. But the fee mechanism is, it works, but it's not optimal, basically. So right now, 50% of the total transaction fee, which includes priority fees, are burned. And that is different than something like Ethereum, which only burns the base fee and has the entire priority fee flow to the validator. And why that matters is when you're burning the piece, that flows to the validator.
00:24:17.034 - 00:24:52.922, Speaker A: So the priority fee, when that gets burned, the validator then becomes incentivized to make a side deal with the user, or what they call out of network payments. So if I was a user willing to transact, and I was willing to pay one Sol in priority fees, the validator of my transaction would get 0.5 soul after the 50% of it was burned as their payment. And so I'm incentivized to figure out who that validator is, make an out of network payment to them of like zero point 51 or zero point 51 sol.
00:24:52.976 - 00:24:53.146, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:53.168 - 00:25:18.654, Speaker A: So just over that 50% mark, and that way I am paying less and the validator is receiving more because none of that out of network payment will get burned. And so Netnet, the validator, is happier, and I'm happier as a user. And so this isn't great. It's a bit of like a value leakage in the system. And Solana researchers are aware of this. It just hasn't become a huge, huge issue yet. And so we'll put this link in the show notes.
00:25:18.654 - 00:25:58.606, Speaker A: But there is a Umbra research paper that dives into what Solana fees look like today, and kind of what the feed mechanism design is. And this paper was written by Eugene Chen, Zerox shit trader, absolute stud of a researcher. So definitely give this thing a read. I think there's a lot to learn from what they're talking about. And then the last talking point I have today as it relates to Solana, this one's a bit tangential to why Salana is in the cool throne, but it's just a really cool. Not even cool, it's terrible. But Connor, a director at Coinbase, tweeted this out the other day, and it wasn't that long ago, where Robin Hood had to force liquidate about 1.9
00:25:58.606 - 00:26:24.230, Speaker A: million in Sol from their holders because the SEC came out and said, soul is a security. You can't have this listed. And Robin Hood was like, well, shoot, what do we do? It's the SEC. We kind of are forced to listen to them. And so they sold. This was basically at the sole Lowe's too. And so the SEC just absolutely wrecked the retail users that were using Robinhood, force liquidated them, costed him over $100 million, approximately.
00:26:24.230 - 00:26:50.654, Speaker A: So it's kind of interesting to see this. And more interestingly, Robinhood is launching in the EU and Seoul. The asset will be listed there. So not only can us users, not only did us users get liquidated at the lows, but now european users can access this asset. So you can kind of just see the overall mess that got made here. But, yeah, I guess that's a bit tangential. So I don't know if anyone has any points on any of those topics that I just brought up.
00:26:50.692 - 00:27:13.880, Speaker B: I got a quick question for you, Dan. You say priority fees are reaching all time high, and I would guess that continues to increase as activity on salana increases. If fire dancer goes live and transaction throughput like ten x's or 50 x's, whatever fire dancer is promising, then is there really sort of no need for people to pay priority fees anymore? And will that drastically come down?
00:27:14.250 - 00:27:53.982, Speaker A: That is a very interesting question. I don't know, off top of my head, to be honest. I'd have to think through that. That is an interesting one, because the idea of induced demand, I think, probably will play a role here. And the fact that more transactions can exist, they probably will exist similar to, like you can say, oh, I don't want to go too tangential. The reason I think that might play a factor here is because if the throughput is that much higher and it's actually being filled, then there could still be that same bit of hot state. Right? In fact, if you're still fighting over the same state, then you're still going to see those increased transaction fees.
00:27:53.982 - 00:28:04.870, Speaker A: So I would say, no, not necessarily that they'll go lower. I would expect them to stay flat or go higher, to be honest. First reaction. And again, I definitely need to do more research around that specific topic.
00:28:05.770 - 00:29:37.334, Speaker D: Yeah, I was kind of going to switch the topic in the sense that go back to the whole airdrop thing and how Solana has basically been kind of growing throughout the last three or four months or so, where it's so funny how suddenly everybody starts talking about how great the tech is and how it can revolutionize things when the price goes up, even though the tech has always been there. It's interesting to see the price kind of drive the narrative, but I feel that it's definitely deserved. And it's cool to see now that every piece or all the pieces are kind of falling into place, where first the l one token goes up in price, and then these high quality projects start popping up, and, of course, they've been building for a long time. And then these wealth effects start coming into play, where airdrops become more meaning, maybe more meaningful, but real users can benefit from that. And then wealth effects can grow on the chain, and that then leads to more usage, and that kind of starts off the flywheel, and things are looking kind of cool right now or super good for the chain. And, yeah, I got to say, I wasn't a big believer, like, three months ago, but now I've kind of flipped my mind on this and think that this will definitely be a big narrative or continue to be a big narrative going on or going into the next.
00:29:37.372 - 00:30:21.982, Speaker A: Year, I had someone reach out to me, a team member of a pretty prominent player on the investment side of the space. And about two months ago, to the dot, he reached out to me and was like, all I'm doing is looking at Solana Metrics and seeing all these increases of activity, and I go try to find something interesting on chain, and there's just nothing. It's still a barren, desolate land. And he reached out back out to me today, actually, right before we started recording, and was like, all right, I was completely wrong. This is the most fun I've had on chain in years, since 2021. And it's true. I think you have a great point about the price driving the narrative here, because price goes up, people bridge over, you get on chain.
00:30:21.982 - 00:30:48.038, Speaker A: And one thing that I think is true with Solana, more so than any other chain, is once you use it, if you're a previous Ethereum user and you use Solana, you notice the difference. And that, I think, feels good. And if there's things to do and it feels good to be there, I think you end up staying. And so, I don't know. I think you're definitely right that price drove narrative on this one. But now people are here, and so it's the question of, well, what are you going to do with these users?
00:30:48.214 - 00:31:13.006, Speaker C: I agree with that. I do think it comes strictly down to the user experience. I think we were kind of like head in the sand a little bit, kind of like just using the different l two s, got used to it, loved the ultrasound money, narrative. Got a little bit ahead of ourselves. And then you kind of realize, shit, I want to use friend tech. Got a bridge to base like, oh, I want to use vertex. Got a bridge to arbitram or, oh, I want to use aerodrome.
00:31:13.006 - 00:31:31.020, Speaker C: I got a bridge to optimism that's a pain in the ass even to just get yourself over from one of the l two s or ethereum over to Salana. Once you get there, you're like, all right, I'm just going to chill here because I don't feel like going through all that again. And then you see the quick fees or the low fees, the quick transactions, and then you're kind of, I don't know, soul pilled a little bit.
00:31:32.030 - 00:31:58.498, Speaker B: I'll be a bit cynical here. I think the user experience is definitely great. I don't need to wait like 12 seconds for my transaction to confirm. Gas is like 0.1, probably. I probably missed a zero in there. But as far as things to do, I would guess, like, your average user is still doing the same things that they would be doing on Ethereum, probably a bit richer from the.
00:31:58.498 - 00:32:44.754, Speaker B: But, you know, they're still trading on a perf decks, they're still borrowing and lending and say, like marginfi or Camino, they're lping on Meteora, trying out Jupiter's new sort of product. It's not like we've went through an entire paradigm shift and Salana suddenly has ten x more interesting apps. Sure. I'll add a caveat that it seems like there's a lot sort of broader apps out there on Salana. There's interesting deep in projects. There's sort of like, study more consumer focused apps. But it's not like we've reached a stage where your average normal human being that's not a complete Djen and just wants a ten x long like Eve has that much more to do on Salana today.
00:32:44.952 - 00:34:04.220, Speaker A: I hear you, but I'm going to push back because this is what Ethereum did three years ago in DFI summer. This is what the start looked like, right? It was mostly just poking around, like playing with apps that you probably don't necessarily want to lever three x long on a certain DFI asset on Salana right now, but you're just like executing transactions and playing around and throwing $30 in a liquidity pool or something, right? And so if you fast forward long enough to that world that you described, where there was all these things that are happening on Salana that cannot happen on other chains, and it was like this rich experience where there's so many things that you're playing games on Salana and you were doing x, Y and Z, social apps, whatever it is, how would that all start? And my answer would be, it would probably look a lot like what's happening right now, where you're doing a lot of the same things that happened three years ago on Ethereum, but that is onboarding developers into this ecosystem because now people are talking about it. As Brick mentioned, the price is going up and it gets automatically more interesting. It's just how. That's an unfortunate way. This industry definitely works. And then on top of that, once you start bringing in increasing number of developers, a lot of them start building developer tooling, which is like a really key aspect here that needs to get better.
00:34:04.220 - 00:34:33.060, Speaker A: Building smart contracts on Ethereum is relatively easy now, right? Just launching a contract, there's a lot of great tools that developers can leverage, and it's definitely not the same scale on Solana yet. So you still need some of that to get built out. And so why I think this moment is still very important is because it is the early innings of that world that you described, where there's all these things that are happening that cannot exist on other chains. Yes, that's obviously the end goal, but it's not a place that you can just start.
00:34:33.830 - 00:35:24.366, Speaker B: I definitely agree in the point that the ecosystem needs to start from somewhere. And I just want to say there's still a long way to go from crypto reaching mass adoption. But given the current crypto user base, sure, it definitely is catching up very rapidly to Ethereum, or perhaps even soon surpassing Ethereum on things to do. I do think there's a path that's perhaps a bit more straightforward for Solana than Ethereum to reach mass adoption, whether that's through payments. It seems like Coinbase and Circle are both warming up to Solana as a blockchain to use for payments a lot more in recent weeks. Mert constantly spamming Byron Armstrong probably did a little bit there. Visa is going to use Solana, Shopify pay is also on Solana.
00:35:24.366 - 00:36:23.570, Speaker B: And also there's a lot of deep in projects that launches Solana, which I think touch sort of like the lives of just your average user, right? Like the daily lives of average user. For example, like helium. Chances are you don't like T Mobile because they charge you like $35 and Helium just pushed out their $20 unlimited plan, which is like a pretty good deal. Or for example, you're just an Uber driver or you own a car and you want to earn some extra money, then you can buy a hive mapper map. And that's pretty useful, I think, both from sort of developer perspective because they launched this new map image API and scout too, but also from sort of like infrastructure perspective in providing a lot of this real time mapping to kind of everyone to be like. It could be Google Maps, it could be like a real estate agent who wants to see how the current house looks. It could be the government if they wanted to see whether the road had potholes.
00:36:23.570 - 00:36:49.342, Speaker B: It could be a hedge fund because hedge funds, they stock like parking lots. I put out this example on Twitter, but there are hedge funds that pay for satellites to stalk grocery store parking lots to basically forecast earnings. And I think they're pretty good at know like having something like hypemaper could be really valuable. So I do think there's a very feasible path to expanding beyond perb sparring lending dexes yeah, maybe.
00:36:49.476 - 00:37:28.300, Speaker D: I summarized by saying that my main takeaway was that there's probably a lot of, or there is a lot of cool tech around in crypto, but the problem is that there's not enough attention to go around for the whole vertical and then some of these chains are probably going to die. Although the solution would be objectively a better built, like, I don't know, mechanism or solution, and you just need that attention span to go to the right places, maybe even for the industry to move forward.
00:37:30.110 - 00:38:31.466, Speaker B: I agree on the attention span thing. Another thing that I want to point out on the dab front is say Ethereum goes to ten k next cycle, right? That means at some point your very standard uniswap swap is going to cost like $200, maybe in the peak of the bull market, God forbid a really popular NFT launch. And then dengun has just been postponed to March. If we're lucky, we might get it by April. I don't want to say it's over for Ethereum, but I think at some point, if you're a Dap, you really have to consider if every swapper is paying $200 just to swap, do some basic action on your protocol. Where could have that money gone? It could have went to either side of the marketplace, either like the swapper or for example, the LP on Uniswap. And at some point I think those costs are significant enough for you to really consider what you're doing on Ethereum, especially from a value accrual perspective.
00:38:31.466 - 00:39:23.700, Speaker B: And I think on Solana, just from the base fees perspective, that's so much lower than Ethereum, but also Salana is doing a lot of research into fee markets. They have local fee markets, but also I know Anatoly and Eugene from Phoenix are also exploring sort of like a per account 1559. They basically want to create this end game. I think this is just a discussion, but an end game where individual daps can control their sort of pricing curves for gas fees. Because NFT mints amm central to my order books, they'll all need different curves. And I think that sort of like customizability will be very important, especially when your DAP reaches a large enough scale, which I don't think any DAP in crypto is kind of there yet in the grand scheme of things.
00:39:24.630 - 00:40:16.174, Speaker A: One caveat I just want to give to the listeners is you mentioned that if ETH runs, then transactions get more expensive, which is true, except Ethereum is designed in such a way that it's dependent on the user's demand. So you said like an example of about $200, which I think it will absolutely hit $200. This happened last bull run. No reason to think it wouldn't. But I don't want listeners to take away. It's not like a fixed thing, right? Because the price of a transaction will be the market rate of whatever users are willing to pay. Because even if the price of ETH flies and goes up five x, that doesn't mean that the base fee will increase that much, right? Like if the base fee runs up to 200 gwe when ETH is ten k, then that would be an insanely expensive transaction, like $1,000 transaction, which users won't.
00:40:16.174 - 00:40:37.890, Speaker A: I'm not going to say won't, but would be way less likely to pay. So however much users are willing to spend will ultimately determine the price of a transaction. It isn't fixed one to one with the USD price. So that is an important caveat there. But yeah, Ren, I do agree with you. Last bull run, it got expensive as shit to transact on chain. Even right now it's still expensive.
00:40:37.890 - 00:40:40.166, Speaker A: So I definitely agree with you.
00:40:40.268 - 00:41:08.674, Speaker C: I would push back on that though a little bit, Dan, just because we haven't gone through a bull market with so many live l two s, we have fixed demand for Ethereum like DA, and I honestly think that that marginal usage could how many times have you wanted to go bridge from chain a to chain b and realized I got to stop through Ethereum first because there's not enough liquidity on this bridge to go there? I've been dealing with that with Salana, which is just such a pain in the ass. Because I don't feel like going to eth, but sometimes I'm just kind of forced to.
00:41:08.872 - 00:41:38.886, Speaker A: Okay, that's actually a really interesting counterpoint to that idea, because you're right, and l two s pass those fees on to their users. So I guess it's still dependent on the users, but those users pay way less in fees and that still falls down to the base layer. So it'd be really interesting. You're definitely right. Right now, I think l two s float between four and 12% of total gas consumption on ETh. But if that goes higher, that's going to be a really interesting factor here. That's a great flag.
00:41:38.998 - 00:42:16.520, Speaker C: But then on top of that too, I've even seen l two fees get up to like $0.75 if you get that gwe spike on main net, and then you've got users trying to transact on l two s doing what they're supposed to be doing to scale ethereum, even you could see those fees go to two, three, four, or $5, I bet. So maybe on the optimistic roll ups only, I'm not really sure. I haven't played around too much with the Zkavm, so I know those are supposed to scale more exponentially with transactions, so it'll be interesting to see how that plays out. But actually, I just thought of this too. Maybe that's what gets zkavms to kind of get a little increase in usage because they haven't really seen much against the optimistic rule of counterparts thus far.
00:42:17.050 - 00:42:36.090, Speaker A: Yeah, ZK sync just launched their latest prover upgrade called Boojam. And right now it looks like it's the cheapest l two in terms of transaction costs. And so it's interesting to think about. Obviously they're being very heavily cycled. That's very clear. I don't think there's much debate around that. I don't think that's like a contentious statement.
00:42:36.090 - 00:43:21.562, Speaker A: And one thing that's doing is amortizing the cost of that many transactions across each user. And that's kind of like you need, if there's one transaction on an optimistic roll up, it would be much cheaper than if there was one transaction on a ZK roll up. And so if you have like right now, ZK syncs doing like a million transactions per day, which is way more than the largest optimistic roll ups, and that actually is driving these fees lower. So these cyblors and airdrop farmers are actually providing a value to the chain, which is like this very weird thing to think about because they're literally just farming an airdrop and they will turn off when that gets launched. But they are weirdly doing a favor to the regular users of the chain right now.
00:43:21.696 - 00:43:28.880, Speaker C: That's actually a very cool point, but we totally just went on a nerd tangent. Dan Brick, who you got on the hot seat cool throne this week?
00:43:29.730 - 00:45:10.922, Speaker D: Yeah, for my cool throne this week I have the Evo protocol and the whole team, I think they've been launching really cool products lately and just like pushing out super cool stuff that's kind of, although they're in the options and perps vertical, which is super competed, and it's not like a new, I don't know, paradigm in itself. They're just like creating really easy to use, well functioning products. And their most recent release was the I'm not sure how to pronounce this AEUSD I used, which basically allows the users of the exchange to earn yield on their collateral. And it works by having a 5% backing of USDC, which doesn't earn anything, it's just there for liquidity reasons and then the rest. So 95% is deposited into Makerdao's die savings rate module, which rounds up to, if you look at the yield that AEUSD token is currently earning, it's about 5% APY. And yeah, I guess the launch, they're kind of reliant on Makerdao keeping enough USDC in their PSM module because basically, to put it short, you need liquidity to be there for Evo to be able to pull those stablecoins back out to their protocol. So that could be like a risk factor.
00:45:10.922 - 00:46:43.770, Speaker D: But all in all, I think it's cool that they're the first exchange that launched this and should be a great way to attract more customers. Because basically if you have two solutions that work equally well, but the other one just provides yield and you're willing to take a bit more risk, on which I guess crypto users are usually very willing to do, you should choose Avo as your exchange or the exchange you're trading on. And then also they recently implemented spot swaps within the exchange, so you don't need to get out of their L2 solution and then get back in, but you can swap within the protocol. And yeah, on top of that, as we talked about earlier on this podcast, pre launch futures have been super cool. And then lastly, to top things off, like Abo is currently making more revenue than ribbon finance ever did, even during the last peak of the pool cycle, which I just feel that is a good example of a team executing well and just introducing products that work really well in their vertical. And just as a reminder, they're doing their token swap, the latest at the end of next year's January. So definitely something worth keeping an eye on if you believe that they're able to penetrate either options or perps vertical more heavily.
00:46:44.190 - 00:47:31.440, Speaker A: I definitely want to jam on the tokenomics side of thing here, but first question that came to my mind was you mentioned like maybe crypto users are just willing to take on risks. Well, the 800 million in the blast deposit contract definitely tells me that's true, but I'm curious, do you think this blast model of taking deposits and rehypothecating them into different assets is. Maybe that's not the right word, but nonetheless investing the underlying assets in different products, do you think that trend will continue with. I don't really think that ever makes sense for arbitram or optimism or some of these larger chains, but I'm curious. That kind of seems like an edge for smaller chains to be able to leverage that and do something interesting or even app chains like what Avo is doing.
00:47:33.090 - 00:48:23.840, Speaker D: To me, it doesn't really make sense for if you're just a basic L2 that's like the general purpose blockchain, then I'd say it doesn't really make sense because you're introducing so much risk that isn't voluntary or basically, if you want to use the chain, you have to take that risk on. But then if you're an upchain and you introduce a certain solution on top of your application which allows the user, if they want to, to go into this yield bearing product, then I just see that as a positive because then the user just has the option to do that if they want to. And it should be pretty clear that it's not risk free. Or like, you can say that it's close to risk free, but as I said, nothing's ever free.
00:48:24.290 - 00:49:24.542, Speaker B: I think that trend towards capital efficiency just continues forever within crypto, to be honest. And I think we continue to just take that to different levels of extreme after we've reached the next level of risk. I think Avos one is slightly better in a sense that if I'm not wrong, it's opt in. So it's not necessarily that your USDC is turned into a USD, but however, in a scenario of a mass insolvency event or like a mass sort of redemption event, I wouldn't be too surprised to if they spread out that risk between the AEUSD converters and the non AUSD converters. So I'm not sure there's that much difference. At the end of the day, I do think a large l two is going to adopt this yield bearing token in the bridge contract model sometime in 2024. And I think, knowing crypto, we're just going to take that to the extreme.
00:49:24.542 - 00:50:26.158, Speaker B: I wouldn't be too surprised. In four years, there's something in ABS, and the bridge contract is restaked, and actually yield is generated using the ABS. I think maybe like a scenario where this makes sense is like, if you have ef in a bridge contract for, say, optimism, first you stake that into a liquid staking solution. You get like 3.5% or whatever, and then you put that into Eigen layer, and then you delegate that to one operator, or like a few operators who are operating, for example, a shared sequencer for optimism. Right? And so the extra risk that is basically attributed to your ETH in the bridge contract is a, sort of like the liquid staking risk, and b, the excess risk from optimism, but sort of like the only risk you have from running that Abs, which is like a shared sequencer, is slashing risk. Right? And theoretically, that should be defined by optimism, because it's a shared sequencer for optimism.
00:50:26.158 - 00:50:47.740, Speaker B: But you may be able to generate extra yield or interest or returns or emissions, whatever term you want to use on your ETH in your bridge contract. I think that would be really interesting to see. I'll need to think a lot more about the potential risk or alignment of that model, but I wouldn't be too surprised, to be honest, if we see something like that in a few years.
00:50:48.510 - 00:51:19.000, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with you, ran. But back to Avo specifically, I like the idea. I just get worried about the liquidity. I feel like a better fit for something like this would be Athena's USD, their stablecoin, because it's inherently yield generating, and there's no risk of not being able to actually have enough liquidity to meet withdrawal redemptions. But I don't know. I guess if they've been working on this for a year, like you said, then they probably didn't know that that was going to be an option at any point.
00:51:19.370 - 00:51:57.570, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. I'm a firm believer in give the market what it wants, and then if it blow ups, you can't really blame anyone else except yourself. And kind of from an investor's perspective, sometimes you just have to bet on these solutions that you kind of maybe are skeptical of from a risk perspective. But then you also have to know when to get out and when it gets too hectic. So, yeah, I can't really complain about a L2 solution implementing yield into their mechanism.
00:51:58.390 - 00:52:17.430, Speaker C: One more question on the Avo front, brick. Do you know how much revenue they've generated? I guess over the last month or so? Sorry to put you on the spot, but I'm just curious because I thought the tokenomics redesign, they had like a $5 million buffer until they started implementing the maker style buyback and burn.
00:52:18.750 - 00:53:24.126, Speaker D: Yeah, actually, I'm not sure of the specific numbers, what's been happening recently, but for me, I define protocol revenue as just like the top line revenue it creates. So basically, a lot of people call that fees, but if that makes sense, I'm not sure how close they are to hitting that. So for those who don't know, the new recently passed proposal changes the kind of the operating model such that Avo generated revenue is used. The first 5 million is used to cover operating expenses for the team that has been building the project, and then after that, additional revenue is used to buy tokens from a Uniswap pool and then lping those tokens back into the same pool. So the same mechanism as Makerdo is currently using for their protocol owned liquidity. But yeah, I'm not sure about the specific numbers, how much revenue they've been generating for the last, let's say one.
00:53:24.148 - 00:53:35.760, Speaker A: Month, and then on the token side, so I know they're migrating from ribbon to Avo. Any other major changes that we should be aware of in terms of the tokenomic changes?
00:53:36.870 - 00:54:50.490, Speaker D: I think one thing the market hasn't really paid attention to yet is the fact that when you migrate from ribbon to Avo, you can't migrate straight to Avo. You have to go through staked Avo, and that has a three month unlocking period or staking period. So that means that when the token swap happens or you become able to go from ribbon to savo, it's going to be at least three months until the full liquidity comes back on. And in the beginning, all liquidity will come from the project's treasury, which holds like around 40% of the supply right now. And that will fully be swapped into normal AvO. So that doesn't have like a staking period, and then off that 40% of the total supply, a certain amount is going to be used to seed liquidity in a uniswap pool, and then the rest will be used for stuff like incentives. So avoid is also planning on doing an airdrop.
00:54:50.490 - 00:55:29.720, Speaker D: So maybe worth trying out the project if you're looking to benefit from that. But yeah, I think the mechanism are super interesting and we could see it being beneficial for the token price because my guess is that based on KPIs and fundamentals, the project is doing better and better, but the price is kind of lagging behind. So if liquidity kind of becomes more restricted and then demand and mind share just go up, it could do very well in the future. Or once they do the token swap event.
00:55:30.410 - 00:55:36.600, Speaker A: Nice. It's definitely a great flag and a good project to pay attention to, brick, but do you think that's a good place to take it home, guys?
00:55:38.810 - 00:55:39.654, Speaker C: Yes.
00:55:39.852 - 00:56:12.030, Speaker A: All right, let's do it then. Thanks for coming on, Brick and Ren. It was a great show. If you're listening, be sure to check out Das London. We're going to be there March of next year, institutional focus conference. Lots of great people in the audience, incredible panels set up that just really going to dive into how do we onboard the institutional side of the industry, how do we bring them here? How do we get that institutional capital allocated? What do they want to see? How is that different than what retail users want? And how can we kind of meet in the middle? So again, Das London, March 2024. Be there.
