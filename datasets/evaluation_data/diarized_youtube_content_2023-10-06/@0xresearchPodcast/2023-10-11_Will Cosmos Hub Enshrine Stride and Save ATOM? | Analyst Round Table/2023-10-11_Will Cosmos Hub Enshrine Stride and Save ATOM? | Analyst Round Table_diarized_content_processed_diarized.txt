00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.666, Speaker A: The fact is, all the issues that you see on Cosmos historically are going to port over to the L two space. Optimism still does not have an interoperability solution. There's still not an interoperability solution between optimism and arbitrum. And before people start coming into the comments saying, oh, CCIP from Chainlink is going to solve world hunger, slow your role. It hasn't even launched yet. It hasn't really been battle tested. It's easy to say that when it's just a concept.
00:00:24.666 - 00:00:32.440, Speaker A: But until it has a year or two under its belt, I personally would not trust any bridge outside of IBC today.
00:00:35.290 - 00:01:11.778, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We got a great analyst episode lined up for you guys today and really liking this new format. So glad you guys are in the same boat with us. It really just gives us the floor to just jam on what we've been thinking about all week. So we got another one rolling this week with effort, capital and Ren. But before we dive into the thick of it, quick word from our sponsor, the Hexins, the most hardcore security team in web3. They're working a ton with ZK and novel cryptography, and they've worked with trusted projects like Polygon, including work on their new ZK EVM, as well as Mantle Risk, Zero, Lido, one inch, new bank, and more.
00:01:11.778 - 00:01:47.658, Speaker B: We are recording this episode on October 6, and it will be released on the following Wednesday. So again, we're battling through some PTO and some time off. The boys are doing a little R and R, so forgive us if anything in this goes stale before it gets released. We're doing our best here, but we will be back to the regular scheduled programming the week after this. This week we have a interview section going live on the Thursday of the week. And another good episode, this one with bitwise. Again, Matt Hogan and Ryan Rasmussen make a third appearance.
00:01:47.658 - 00:01:59.714, Speaker B: I don't know. We're giving these guys too much time. No, I'm kidding. They're always a pleasure. A lot of good talk on ETFs, why it's important as well. As always, we get their institutional viewpoint. So let's jump into the analyst segment, though.
00:01:59.714 - 00:02:14.198, Speaker B: Maybe I'll get effort capital to kick things off. He was just over in Istanbul enjoying the cosmos first event, so I'd love to get a recap of that. And honestly, there's a major news event that kind of rolls us right into the governance update segment. So I'll leave the floor to you, sir.
00:02:14.364 - 00:03:02.466, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, Dan. Yeah. So just got back from Cosmoverse from Istanbul about a little over 24 hours ago at this point. And I'll start off by saying overall, the vibes were pretty immaculate. So despite the bear market, despite I think a lot of narratives in crypto Twitter, especially after the whole op stack and the announcement of base earlier this year, you saw a lot of people really think that the app chain thesis, specifically as it relates to the cosmos ecosystem was dead. That l two s were really taking over this idea, commercializing it in Ethereum, as we all know, Ethereum and the wider l two ecosystem likes to rip ideas off Cosmos and really just do it better distribution and what have you. But despite that narrative, I think that is still out there for those outside the cosmos.
00:03:02.466 - 00:03:52.040, Speaker A: Eco attendance was up 20% year over year. So more people are still following the ecosystem again, despite like, if you look at Adam prices, Adam prices are as low as they were back in June 2022. A large percentage of the attendees were devs and really active community members. There really weren't as much professional capital allocators. So I want to say there was less than 15 people out of the I think there was over 1700 or 1800 attendees at cosmoverse this year. So there was literally less than 15 to 20 people that were in the VC space. I heard that Softbank was there, which is really interesting given their size, hash key, which is like a startup accelerator, and they allocate capital to other areas as well.
00:03:52.040 - 00:04:29.390, Speaker A: I believe Spartan group was there. I could be wrong, and a couple other cosmos specific investors. But overall you could think that that is bearish. I personally think that's bullish. Devs are still building, bear markets are for building, as the old cliche goes. And I fundamentally believe, and again, obviously I'm relatively talking my book, so take it with a grain of salt, but I still think the cosmos ecosystem is the most slept on out of like the three or four major ecosystems in the space. The major takeaways outside of that were a strong focus on cross chain UX.
00:04:29.390 - 00:05:25.038, Speaker A: So we got to this point where IBC is arguably the most valid, has an interoperability protocol, but the UX itself built on top of that still is a little, I don't want to say archaic, but it still has a ways to go. But I think people are going to be shocked that are coming from Ethereum to the cosmos over the next six months. I think they're going to be shocked to see how far we've come. So I think you're seeing a lot of interchange aggregators. So like Dex aggregation over IBC having one account on chain a being able to control another account on chain know making the entire cosmos ecosystem actually feel like one omnichan or one superchain, to quote the optimism thesis. So I think we're very close. You're seeing a lot of work on better wallet, ux having better fiat on ramps leap wallet, which is one of the major wallets in the cosmos.
00:05:25.038 - 00:05:55.760, Speaker A: They presented what their roadmap looks like over the next coming years, and it's really just like a vast improvement over what you've seen in metamask. And even Coinbase wallet, I still think has a lot of long ways to go, a lot of discussion in the ethereum ecosystem around account abstraction, ERC 4337, like tame masters and all that stuff. But it sounds like the cosmos ecosystem and the devs. There are much more focus on ux, I think, and are much further along than what they're giving credit for.
00:05:57.730 - 00:06:52.666, Speaker B: I want to jump in right there because that makes sense that that's the focus, right? Is because if you have this network of app chains that inherently have a piece of friction between them, right, like they are separate ecosystems, they need to connect. There needs to be that super driven focus on UX where if you think about some of these other smart contracting platforms, like, honestly, any of the monolithic L1s, they didn't necessarily need to think about that out of the gates. This is like an impossible question to answer, but I wonder if that played a role in the very engineering focused drip mindset versus bringing an app to a consumer. Quick shout out to Hexins. As we explore today's blockchain landscape, let's take a moment to recognize them. As a premier cybersecurity provider in Web three, Hexons is trusted by tier one projects like Polygon, including a security review on their new Polygon, ZKE, EVM, Mantle, Risk, Zero, Lido, one inch, Newbank, and more. Get a deep dive into your technology stack.
00:06:52.666 - 00:07:08.850, Speaker B: With the most comprehensive analysis and cybersecurity consulting, Hexons not only uses widely known methodologies and flows, but discovers and introduces new ones on a day to day basis. With over $55 billion secured, they cover everything from smart contracts to blockchain to web two pent tests.
00:07:09.430 - 00:07:39.626, Speaker A: Yeah, there's been nearly $7 billion of total value hacked in crypto's nascent history, so it's safe to say your team has a lot on the line. Don't skimp out. Take your security seriously and reach out to Hexans. Don't forget to mention zero X research for a free web two pen test with your partnership and reach out to Hexans at Hexons IO. Find them in the links in the show notes. But without further ado, let's get back to today's episode. There's obviously benefits of building on a monolith, at least up front, and we see obviously some of the downstream or longer term effects of doing so outside of salon.
00:07:39.626 - 00:08:17.100, Speaker A: It sounds like they kind of figured out a lot of the issues with building on a monolithic chain. But the fact is, all the issues that you see on Cosmos historically are going to port over to the L two space. Optimism still does not have an interoperability solution. There's still not an interoperability solution between optimism arbitrum and before people start coming into the comments saying oh, CCIP from Chainlink is going to solve world hunger, slow your role. It hasn't even launched yet. It hasn't really been battle tested. It's easy to say that when it's just a concept, but until it has a year or two under its belt, I personally would not trust any bridge outside of IBC today.
00:08:17.100 - 00:09:12.214, Speaker A: But there's been a strong focus on product, on applications and user experience over the past like six to twelve months in the ecosystem to abstract away IBC. And I think you're starting to see the fruits of that labor starting to play out. And I'm actually really excited to see what the ecosystem looks like end of this year in early 2024. On top of that, obviously, we spoke about it a little bit and it's been in mainstream media, I guess, for the past few months. But native USDC officially coming officially here in the cosmos ecosystem circle, was there and presented the work that they've done with the noble team. To really have seamless transfer of USDC from Ethereum to the cosmos. It's going to be like a really big launch officially, when DYDX comes to see how much native USDC transfers over into the cosmos.
00:09:12.214 - 00:10:01.094, Speaker A: Eco another big thing was like lack of liquidity. Obviously, Cosmos ecosystem is not nearly as liquid as you'd like to see it compared to Ethereum at the very least. And there was a big focus on how do you bring ETH liquidity and bitcoin liquidity over into the cosmos ecosystem and potentially create an on chain economy for bitcoin. So nomic, which is like a BTC bridge leveraging taproot, gave a good presentation. There was a whole host of teams building ZkipC tech to bring main net Ethereum liquidity into the cosmos ecosystem. And I think the last really big takeaway, I'd say, is the ICF, which is not Cosmos hub specific, like the foundation for the wider interchain. And they're sitting on like $280,000,000, a split up between atom, bitcoin and Ethereum.
00:10:01.094 - 00:10:37.800, Speaker A: And I think about like $80 to $90 million of that is sitting in dollars or maybe treasuries. The ICF is extremely well funded for the foreseeable future. And I think that the cosmos ecosystem is, like, teeming with activity. We need to figure out what is that use case that gets users over here? And I don't think this is Cosmos specific. I think the entire crypto ecosystem saying, what is this killer use case? Obviously, we know it's like gambling today. That's why I'm extremely excited about DyDX. And if DyDX is a good product, I think that's going to create, like a flywheel where you see more liquidity and more developers come here, they realize how good and how strong the Cosmos SDK was.
00:10:37.800 - 00:11:38.634, Speaker A: Last thing I'll say. And this kind of parlays. The major announcement at the end of Cosmoverse was the stride and cosmos hub potential merger. So the stride team came up right at the end of Cosmoverse and presented a idea for stride, which is the dominant liquid staking protocol in the cosmos ecosystem, to be acquired by the Cosmos hub. And their reasoning was that, obviously, we're seeing a whole bunch of conversation around Lido and alignment with ethereum, and potentially ethereum enshrining an LST mechanism into the protocol to ensure credible neutrality and safety. And one of the ideas that stride proposed is like, if the cosmos hub acquires stride, then stride can scale to much more billions of dollars worth of liquid staking derivatives or liquid staking tokens. And potentially because the atom asset is more distributed than stride and almost every other chain in the cosmos ecosystem, because of how long it's been around.
00:11:38.634 - 00:12:18.530, Speaker A: I personally think that the distribution of the asset is what correlates to how neutral a given protocol could be. And their thinking was, for stride to be the ultimate neutral LST provider, it probably needs the most distributed and largest market cap asset backing it. And that goes beyond just leveraging the cosmos hub for security. That means actual atom being the governance asset of the protocol as well. So I'll pause there because I think we can kind of riff on about this a lot, but it's a really interesting concept, especially on the backs of Vitalik's piece on minimum viable enshrinement.
00:12:18.610 - 00:13:22.560, Speaker C: I'll jump in here with a few thoughts. First of all, on the user experience. I think everyone agrees that there's a lot of work to be done, even for example, everything like Coinbase wallet is a better product than metamask. After on chain summer, Brian Armstrong basically came out with a tweet saying okay guys, after on chain summer, I've realized that our wallet is completely dog shit. There's a lot of work that needs to be done, and if I'm not wrong, he put out like a slack message asking every employee to go through the entire onboarding process, spend 3 hours doing that, and send him a personal memo of what their experience was and what they can work on. As far as sort of what the use case or sort of like the app for the cosmos will be, I think Dydx obviously is like a very critical moment for cosmos. But one thing I didn't think about until what you talked about was CCTP, because USDC is going to be sort of like the base token for Dydx and CCTP is live on ethereum avalanche, I think arbitrum and hopefully I would guess optimism sometime soon.
00:13:22.560 - 00:14:30.242, Speaker C: I feel like that could potentially be a very big boost versus a world where CTP did not exist just because that user experience is pretty seamless and it's like a backend technology where any bitch provider can sort of use it. So yeah, I think we'll see a significant amount of inflows there just based off CTP being linked with all of these roll ups or other chains. Lastly, on a note of what you said about sort of cosmos having its own base token, Ethereum has Eve like Avalanche has Avax, Solana has. Sure. Now that I thought about it for I'm not sure that a blockchain needs to have a non stable coin as its sort of like base token. I think obviously it's good for the price and obviously you need the base token for gas fees on most chains. But now that I think about it more, I definitely think that there are going to be blockchains where you're going to see more USDC liquidity than whatever the native gas fee token liquidity is.
00:14:30.242 - 00:14:55.660, Speaker C: But that's like a personal thing and that sort of brings me into the strive and hub merger. Right now that you mentioned that the ICF is sort of like a third bitcoin eve, a third stable coins, and a third Adam. I think I'm thinking, does it make sense if this deal does go through, does stride want Adam? Or for example, would they want USDC? Which one is the asset that they want more.
00:14:57.070 - 00:15:33.526, Speaker A: Well, I think in terms of governance, right. So I think you're saying if the team plus all the stride token holders wanted to get acquired, obviously you probably want to get paid in USDC because it's more stable form of cash. But I think in terms of governance over the stride protocol, what would you do? I guess, would you just lock up? Like where is the world? Where do you lock up USDC? And the amount of USDC you have locked up to a given determines your voting. Like, that'd be really interesting.
00:15:33.708 - 00:16:10.066, Speaker B: The issue there is you can't just print more USDC to fund things. Right? Circle could do that and they could run circle chain and they could somehow print those while still ensuring their backing of user USDC is still one to one. I think that's where the idea of a stable coin kind of breaks down. In this case, you've seen chains like Agoric sticking in the cosmos. Their gas token is ist, right, but it still has its own CDP mechanism behind it, which is kind of interesting. And they still have BlD as well. I don't know.
00:16:10.066 - 00:16:13.380, Speaker B: I'd have to think on that more if I really had like a logical conclusion there.
00:16:14.310 - 00:16:57.050, Speaker A: Yeah. What's interesting going back, like the whole stride hub thing. So the team presented it at cosmoverse, obviously their rounds of applause. After that, there was like a quick panel discussion with the stride team. Some of the core dev teams like informal about the implications. What does this mean for liquid staking? Where did this idea come from? And it sounds like the idea came on a Monday, at Monday night, after a couple of drinks, the stride team and one of the core dev teams were like, hey, it seems like a good idea. I personally do think that there's some merit to this idea, but I also understand the other side of it.
00:16:57.050 - 00:17:33.994, Speaker A: There's a lot of drama going on in the Cosmos hub forum right now. It is hot. People are upset, especially a lot of stride token holders, because they feel like they are getting potentially short end of the stick if merger goes through. It's like, hey, look, I bought stride for this reason. There's a whole large lot of upside. Shride is valued at approximately $80 million market cap right now, or it was prior to this proposal, but idea being floated after that, it pumped 10% on the idea being announced and now it's actually down 20% week to date. So the market is kind of, it sounds like upset.
00:17:33.994 - 00:18:17.306, Speaker A: Stride token holders are upset. But also want to be clear, the Cosmos hub doesn't even have a treasury sizable enough to actually purchase stride at current market cap. So I think we've seen from the Ferrari proposal historically, like mergers and acquisitions, are very hostile. Both counterparties in these transactions never feel like they're getting their full value. You can argue that Stride is not worth it at current prices because 80% of its TbL is atom anyways. And you can also argue that the cosmos hub should maybe potentially remain credibly neutral and not own a specific LST provider. I see both sides of the argument, but I could also make a strong case for why it actually makes sense.
00:18:17.306 - 00:19:07.526, Speaker A: I ultimately think that the end state is probably not going to be a merger, maybe, or an acquisition, I should say. I think what we're going to have to do is probably find a middle ground, which is like some type of treasury swap where the Cosmos hub would love to have a team like Stride who have shown time and time again they can execute. Maybe the hub buys out Stride teams and Stride's VC allocation. Stride team has KPIs and ultimately work on behalf of the hub, but still work specifically on Stride, the protocol on behalf of the hub. So there's some type of alignment there between the core development team and the protocol. And ultimately, maybe the hub also gets governance rights by buying out the stride allocation from the team and investors. But this is going to be a really interesting ride.
00:19:07.526 - 00:19:14.966, Speaker A: It's going to probably take a few months for the hub community and the stride community to figure out what they want to do, but really interesting time.
00:19:15.088 - 00:19:40.934, Speaker B: Yeah. Let's break this down a bit, because we've been talking about it since the announcement, basically. So I feel like we just jumped to the end state there. But if we rewind and go from the beginning. So Stride wants to get acquired by the hub. And to your point, the hub doesn't have a community pool that just has approximately 70, 80 million sitting in it, which is roughly the FDV of stride today. Which, by the way, I did not realize it, like, nuked 20% over the past week.
00:19:40.934 - 00:20:20.754, Speaker B: That's pretty interesting. So there's like a couple of immediate questions that come up here. First of all, what's the fair value of stride? Second of all, which tokens deserve to be bought at the fair value? Right? Like liquid tokens. Of course, if I'm just an average Joe holding a stride, I deserve to be bought at fair value. If I'm the team and I'm vesting. I don't know these specific terms off the top of my head for the stride team, but something probably like a one year cliff, four year vest did my tokens that vest to me in four years. Am I fully deserving of those tokens because I only created a half baked product? Should those be bought out at fair value? I love the stride team.
00:20:20.754 - 00:20:55.760, Speaker B: I think they're incredible. And I'm not trying to throw shade at all here. I'm just saying from an M a standpoint, the answer is probably no. Investors, they seeded the capital, took full risk that the protocol would go nowhere. Do their token allocation deserve to be bought out even if they are on that fourth year of their vest? That's a pretty gray area. And then what about additional liquidity incentives? I know stride had a large portion of its token allocation saved for liquidity incentives given the nature of the protocol being a liquid staking protocol. And liquidity is very important to have a successful product.
00:20:55.760 - 00:21:51.070, Speaker B: Should those be bought mean maybe yes, because, know, you buy them out in atom now Adam becomes this incentive token. Is that a good thing for Adam? There's debate around that. And then lastly, what about the stride community pool? I don't know the size of the community pool. I assume there's a community pool just given it's a hub chain or, sorry, a cosmos SDK chain. And that's like one of the modules that I would imagine is part of stride. Should those tokens be bought out? Probably not, because why would they just buy a community pool? So there's like all these questions around, how do you actually buy, what are you buying, first of all? And how do you buy it? Then the next question is, well, with what assets do I buy it? And the answer kind of has to be a one time mint of atom. And so if you're going to mint somewhere between 60 and $80 million of atom, that's roughly 3% of the current market cap, around 2 billion.
00:21:51.070 - 00:22:40.042, Speaker B: And so you got to ask yourself, like, as an atom holder, do I want to make a, take a three to 5% hit of inflation for this product of Stride? I see a lot of people freaking out about that and I'm like, guys, your inflation rate is what, 16% today? It's not going to make a difference. So that was one thing I find super interesting, was like, there was a huge debate about we're not minting more atom. That's ridiculous. But if you're minting more atom to acquire a really good product that people love and generates real revenue, that's fucking great. The question is, is it going to continue generating? Yeah. Well, are they willing to accept, is it going to actually generate meaningful revenue in the future? Going forward. There's a lot of question marks.
00:22:40.042 - 00:23:14.060, Speaker B: And ultimately, I think if we had a perfectly efficient market, Stride would be trading at the fair value of the business. And then you could just decide which tokens get bought out at the full fair value. But we don't have that market. We do not have efficiency. So just buying FDV or buying market cap, that's probably not the fair value. If you ran this thing out, Stride is mostly like a business rather than some other economy. Like Stride is not really money doesn't have that same level of premium like you would have to ascribe to some other l ones.
00:23:14.060 - 00:23:38.580, Speaker B: So it's probably just a classic good old DCF. But then you're doing that on a super venture. Stride is like, what, just over a year old? So then you're going to do revenue multiples and try to do some comparative analysis and do some market come to some market based analysis and that's not going to be what it's trading at. There's just no way. I haven't done the analysis myself. I don't know.
00:23:39.190 - 00:24:38.660, Speaker A: Yeah, just to give some high level numbers. So right now, Stride, about 2% of all Atom staked. Atom is being liquid staked. And when you include that revenue from liquid staked, Atom, which makes up 80% of all of Stride's TvL and the other liquid staked assets that stride supports, Stride is getting about $700,000 revenue annualized. And Stride actually passed a proposal a few months ago where all revenue actually gets sent to the token holders, which is interesting because a lot of protocols like to be like, oh yeah, it's protocol revenue, but token holders don't get. It's going into our dow treasury and yeah, I won't go on that, elaborate on that further, but there's a lot of catalysts for Stride. So Dydx coming, right? Stake DyDX is going to likely be a cash cow if Stride supports stake DyDX, which some alpha I'm hearing they will be.
00:24:38.660 - 00:24:51.842, Speaker A: If they do, that can be a huge boon and a huge revenue driver for stride token holders. And also they're likely going to become the major liquid staking provider for Celestia's new token TIa right off the bat.
00:24:51.996 - 00:25:35.042, Speaker B: Hold on, I got a question here. And this kind of sort of goes off topic, but not really what is the why? Okay, so the DyDX token was going to make a ton of fee revenue. I assume it'll still get staking revenue. So it's going to have real yield through trading fees plus token inflation, yes, that makes the yield quite high. It makes it an interesting asset. But DyDX is never trying to be money or anything like that. Okay, so when you start mapping this out, it's like, why do we need liquid stake tokens for everything? Why do I need liquid staked Juno? Or why do I need liquid staked Osmo? Honestly, just because they're good products doesn't mean I want the liquid staked token.
00:25:35.042 - 00:25:42.780, Speaker B: I want liquid staked ETH because ETH is a great collateral to use across ethereum, defi, and staked ETH is a better version of it.
00:25:43.470 - 00:26:31.686, Speaker C: I want to say that, yeah, sure, DyDx isn't used for anything. It's not trying to be money, but we always want capital, efficiency and access to leverage. I feel like that's just part of human nature or just an inherent part of the financial system. So stride basically provides that product. There's literally no reason not to use it, right? Hasu said something in a recent idol forum post that LSTs compete on moneyness leading to a winner take most market. And he basically said that liquid staking beats all other forms of staking, which I do agree in. It's just better capital efficiency, and there's other stuff that you can build on top of the liquid stake token.
00:26:31.798 - 00:27:37.182, Speaker A: Imagine a world where you could take the top dividend or cash flow generating businesses that distribute dividends to you, and you were able to actually use that in your normal day to day life. Would you not want to use that? Or wouldn't you want to use that as collateral to run's point? Lever up on your net worth like billionaires. Most billionaires are able to gain their net worth mostly by levering their assets, not through their salaries, but they take the assets they already own, borrow against it, and then do other parades of business opportunities to generate more higher net worth and higher credit line. Dydx would be an ideal form of collateral because it can lower the cost of capital if you want to borrow against it. If it generates 8% yield or real yield in inflation, then you can technically borrow stable coins up to like an 8% borrow rate. There's a whole bunch of, I guess, downstream effects of having a liquid stake Duidx. But to round out this conversation, because I don't know how much we want to go on, I know we have a lot of other things to talk about.
00:27:37.182 - 00:28:52.594, Speaker A: But long story short, there's a lot of callous for liquid stake protocols, like specifically for stride. With UidX and Celestia coming and dependent on the market penetration of liquid staked atom and other liquid staking assets in the cosmos ecosystem, Stride has a legitimate path to bringing in tens of millions of dollars in revenue. We already see Lido, like how much revenue they bring in, but Stride is probably the best, largest competitor to Lido, I think, in the long game. That's my personal opinion, and I think a lot of stride holders see that and see it as pretty much a kingmaker in the next cycle if they're able to execute well, which history has shown that they've been really good at executing. And to your point, Dan, how do you value that? And there's obviously risks associated with any kind of deals like this. And I think ultimately, I don't know if the communities are going to be able to come to an agreement, but it's going to be really interesting to see over the next few months what the ultimate result is. But it would be really cool to see some more closer alignment with the hub in stride, whether that means like a treasury swap or the core development team collapsing into the hub, but specifically to work on stride.
00:28:52.594 - 00:28:58.870, Speaker A: And I don't know exactly what that payment structure would look like, but I think that there's some kind of agreement we can ultimately come to.
00:28:59.020 - 00:30:05.166, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm going to force you guys to make a decision on if this is a good or bad idea, but I'll go first and I'll put some context to this. If I'm a stride holder, I don't think I like it because I think stride is a good business and I think it'll continue to be a good business. And I don't think capitulating at the peak of a bear market or the depths of a bear market, I guess the reverse peak of a bear market is the right time to be doing this. And I think why? Some just like reading through forums and talking to people, it kind of seems like there's a few reasons why people don't seem to love this one. I think this is a bit pessimistic and quite frankly, I don't hold this view, but I have seen it a few times is strides a year old and there was like a one year cliff on team and investors allocations, and that just hit then there's no liquidity on the stride token. So if you wanted to capture some of your profits or if you're a team member, fund your life, you can't really do that because if you sell any meaningful amount, you're going to absolutely nuke the token price. So some are viewing this as like, oh, the stride teams are just trying to get a liquidity event and cash out, basically.
00:30:05.348 - 00:30:28.834, Speaker A: I think it's incredibly like my personal love, and I know you already said this, I love the Shrie team. Bashal, Riley, Aiden, the rest of the team. I met with them personally at Cosmoverse. I've talked to them at length for many months. Obviously, you never know, but I fundamentally believe that they're here. They're one of the. For the long term, they believe in the ethos.
00:30:28.834 - 00:31:07.954, Speaker A: They're here to build in the cosmos ecosystem. But that is a concern, right? So if they can't exit liquidity for their stride because of the illiquidity of the asset. But to me, the Cosmos hub wants developers like that align with the hub. So typically with illiquid assets. And I recently took part of like an OTC deal with an illiquid asset. I won't say the name, but was trying to convert some of asset to stablecoins to fund some initiatives, and the VCs wanted 25% to 30% discount on that asset. And it's like, you know what? Maybe that's what we do.
00:31:07.954 - 00:31:52.720, Speaker A: Maybe if the hub wants to get ownership of stride allocation and also have the dev team align, maybe the dev team takes a 25% to 30% cut on their allocation. And there's like an OTC deal where the hub treasury swaps to buy out the team, specifically the team, so that the stride community can still have upside in the asset. But the stride team is aligned for the future. And we also make sure devs got to eat too, right, if we want to bet on the team. I said this last podcast, bet on the team, not the protocol. In an open source world, anyone can make a liquid staking protocol, but you got to bet on a team like this have shown over the past year that they're here for the long run. One last thing I'll say is going back to this whole idea about how to value something.
00:31:52.720 - 00:32:38.298, Speaker A: This is essentially a two way marketplace. That's all liquid staking protocols are. That's what all D five protocols are. What if a large commercial real estate owner owned 80% of the properties on Airbnb that were listed on Airbnb, just like 80% of TVL is Adam on stride. And then this property owner went to go buy out Airbnb? Would the property owner look at Airbnb and go, well, 80% of the properties listed on your marketplace that drive 80% of your revenue is actually my properties. So I'm not going to buy you out for your full value because 80% of your business is just a repackaged form of what I already own. So that's one also thing that I think the shride community is not looking at the people that are very angry.
00:32:38.298 - 00:32:51.010, Speaker A: And that's also one of the reasons why the Cosmos hub community probably might feel that Shride might be overvalued because 80% of its product or its service is literally just a repackaged form of atom. Which is fair, but you'll never get find like a happy milligram. Unfortunately.
00:32:51.510 - 00:33:37.562, Speaker B: I think that last piece gets interesting though, because the Cosmo sub just introduced the LSM that's likely going to get extrapolated onto other chains. And then now there's a huge opportunity for that to change, especially with DyDX coming in. That will certainly eat into the total of 80%, I think. And so that's why there's just so much contention around this, I think. And the other piece I've seen is, okay, so let's say the merger goes through. Stride is owned by the Cosmos hub. Now, the cosmos hub token holders are deciding which validator sets win of other ecosystems, right? Because that's where, like stride today, the governance of stride decides which validators within the active set receive the delegations through the liquid staking module.
00:33:37.562 - 00:33:58.598, Speaker B: So that's going to be another piece as well. So TLDR and then let's all make a decision on this and move on is if I'm a stride holder, I'm against it. I'm more excited about the future of my product than the price today. If I'm a Cosmos hub, if I'm an atom holder, I fucking love this and I absolutely want it. This is a great way to get a product for the hub. That's it's good business and at a.
00:33:58.604 - 00:34:01.622, Speaker A: Great price and aligned with the growth of the interchange.
00:34:01.686 - 00:34:29.860, Speaker C: I completely agree with Dan's point. And just going back to something, I don't think there's anything wrong. Even if this was like a planned exit or liquidity event since day one, startups in web two do this all the time before they even have a product on their paycheck, they'll have, oh, we're going to try to get acquired by x, Y and Z. I don't think it's like the worst thing to happen. And part of me feels like this is going to be such a contentious m and a event that it might not ever go through.
00:34:31.510 - 00:34:35.726, Speaker B: So yes or no from the strideholder perspective and then the atom token holder.
00:34:35.758 - 00:34:44.840, Speaker C: Perspective, I agree with you. No from a strideholder perspective, yes. From an atom holder perspective, I'm both.
00:34:45.610 - 00:35:17.058, Speaker A: But obviously I do own more Adam than shride, full disclosure, but these are not separate communities. They're the same people. If you are in the cosmos ecosystem, you own both of these, and you're most likely own, like, 90% of the allocation. There's 90% token overlap. So I think it's funny sometimes where the cosmos ecosystem, and I'm part of it, we talk about sovereign communities. It's like, bruh, the same people. Can't we figure out some kind of middle ground? But with that being said, yeah, you're 100% right.
00:35:17.058 - 00:35:30.920, Speaker A: If you think of these as two completely different communities, stride token holder. Like you're pissed. Community, Cosmos hub, community, you're absolutely thrilled. But I think that there's going to be some kind of middle ground that could be figured out and interested to see what happens.
00:35:32.330 - 00:35:54.074, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that's the answer is if it's a no, yes. How do you make it a yes? Yes, and that's probably changing. Who gets paid and how much is probably that simple, to be honest. Let's move on to another governance update. Let's try to make this one maybe a little quicker, but effort. I'll throw it over to you just because you got the details on this again. And we keep talking about Cosmos governance updates, but those people do love governance.
00:35:54.074 - 00:35:55.722, Speaker B: So I guess I'm not too, too surprised.
00:35:55.866 - 00:36:07.562, Speaker A: Amen. Bear. Markets are for governance forum posts, and it's because the cosmos ecosystem is building. That's why, Dan, everyone else is just virtue signaling about Ethereum limit. In the Ethereum ecosystem, the only people.
00:36:07.716 - 00:36:09.540, Speaker B: All right, get on with it.
00:36:10.150 - 00:36:54.080, Speaker A: Cosmos and Solana, that's it. They're the only ones building. Yeah. So Axelar has a really interesting forum post related to their inflation mechanism and is potentially, like, signaling that there's a future for their Axel token to go deflationary. So this proposal, again, I'll do it quickly, but it breaks down to the three things, short term, medium term, and long term strategy for axilar inflation and the future of how Axelar supports cross chain interoperability. So right now, the inflation of Axel is 1% base inflation and then zero point 75% inflation for every subsequent chain that axlar supports. So Axlar supports about 14 chains right now, and the inflation rate of Axel is eleven and a half percent year over year.
00:36:54.080 - 00:37:31.718, Speaker A: This proposal asks to reduce it from zero point 75% for every new chain to 0.3% for every new chain. So that would bring the overall axle inflation down to 5.2%. They also are talking about a potential burn mechanism. So right now, if you want to do a cross chain transfer, leveraging Axelr, there's like a five bits fee, I believe, and like a 0.5 axle fee in addition to the gas fees on both networks you're trying to swap between. And Axlar is proposing using that fee mechanism to burn axle instead of distributing it to Axel stakers.
00:37:31.718 - 00:38:41.940, Speaker A: And that they said that at approximately a 20 x increase in cross chain transfers, leveraging Axlar, if it went from, I think it's about $5 million on a daily basis today, if it went up to $100 million in volume, that that would be enough to counteract up to 10% of inflation of the axle token. So that there's actually a meaningful pathway to seeing axle deflation. And assuming the next bull market, and assuming Axlar is a major beneficiary of the growth of crosschain interoperability, that's like the short term plan. The medium term plan is to have some type of opt in cross chain validation service, so that right now the entire axilar validator set has to support every new chain Axelr supports. And they're saying, well, maybe that's not scalable in the long run. Maybe we have like, if a developer team wants to leverage Axelr, they need to hand pick which validators they want to opt into their service. And then the developer team that wants Axelr support needs to pretty much incentivize validators by buying Axel into a pool, and that Axel is given to the valid or paid to the validators that opt in to support their service.
00:38:41.940 - 00:39:27.602, Speaker A: And this would make sure that there's no new inflation for supporting new chains in the future where there's millions of chains, because, yeah, we definitely need millions of chains in the world. And then the long term vision is leveraging ZK like clients. So we already started to see this, like ZKiBC, but they said in order to bring the cost of validation for this, millions of chains, cross chain infrastructure, we need to figure out a way to bring cost of hardware down to the minimum. And this is probably leveraging zk lite clients and also having incentive mechanism for relayers. So that's the overall axlr piece. It's really interesting. I don't think you've seen the market kind of move on this news at all, but this is the type of news, I think, that's really important.
00:39:27.602 - 00:39:43.442, Speaker A: If you're an axle token holder, if you're interested in the supply and demand mechanics or supply and demand flows of certain tokens. And if this passes, you can actually see a potential reduction of supply overhang on the axle token.
00:39:43.586 - 00:39:50.758, Speaker B: So one really quick question, and then one more complicated question. Really quick question. Is this a forum post or an on chain proposal today?
00:39:50.924 - 00:39:57.594, Speaker A: It's a forum post. It was just posted to taste Friday, October 6 it was just posted on Wednesday, I believe.
00:39:57.712 - 00:40:40.582, Speaker B: Cool. Okay, so about two days ago, maybe the fourth. That's some quick mass there for you, but more complicated question. So I think of things like ETH and Adam, and arguably soul, whether or not, depending on how you want to take it, I don't view those as equity. My mental framework for it is not equity or programmable equity or anything like that. This is a base layer money that is used to create the economic activity within an ecosystem. And I do not have that view for the Axel token, I very much view that as like an application that has a programmable equity token.
00:40:40.582 - 00:40:49.398, Speaker B: And so in that case, how much do I care if it's like inflationary or deflationary?
00:40:49.494 - 00:41:33.580, Speaker C: I think reducing inflation is fine. You don't need to reduce it so much. And especially I think there's a lot of people out there who sort of create buyback and burn mechanisms, or sort of like distributing protocol profits to token holders. And that's just not it. When you're like a super small bridge or like Dex or like a gamify protocol, even, you should be reinvesting all of that money in protocol growth, developers, VD marketing partnerships and all of that nonsense. Don't worry too much about your token, especially if you're not trying to become money, which there's probably only like ten tokens or even less than that should be really trying to become money right now.
00:41:34.430 - 00:41:38.620, Speaker B: Sam's on PTO, so strongly agree with you there.
00:41:40.750 - 00:41:51.886, Speaker A: So what does that look like though? I see two sides. I like the idea of burning because it's effectively like a stock buyback in.
00:41:51.908 - 00:41:53.790, Speaker B: An efficient market, which we don't have.
00:41:53.860 - 00:42:08.450, Speaker A: Inefficient market. Right. Like on a long term time horizon, though it's equivalent to that. But I also agree, we are in the early innings. We have like five on chain users throughout crypto. We have no application that's going to hit mainstream adoption. It's not front tech.
00:42:08.450 - 00:43:03.874, Speaker A: Maybe it starts arena on avalanche. That'll be interesting. But how do you fund further marketing and BD and distribution? Let's say that axle token that's being used, all those fees, let's say it goes into the treasury ultimately, you want to make sure that there's not a supply overhang. If you have a circulating economy, like inflation, is going to lead to supply overhang, decrease in price of the network or of the asset, and nobody wants to see that. So maybe what's interesting is, and ultimately the real economy and real jobs, real people, want to get paid in stable coins. So maybe what you do is take the fees, bring it into the treasury, and then a large portion of those fees, at least for the foreseeable future, are OTC'd to teams that want exposure to Axel, but with a vesting schedule. And in return, the treasury gets stablecoins.
00:43:03.874 - 00:43:16.758, Speaker A: And then we use those stablecoins to either pay Axel validators and delegates, or you use that to pay for strategic purposes like business development and marketing and what have you, and further tech iteration.
00:43:16.854 - 00:44:01.130, Speaker C: I think that's a really important point that you brought up there, right? And when you think of inflation, you think from token units, from the protocols perspective, but to the people receiving the inflation, they probably denominate that in US dollars or stable coins, right? So in the best case scenario, assuming your protocol is growing, then you can slowly reduce the inflation rate over time, but you also have to factor in token prices, say Axo, the token goes ten X. Should the protocol reduce emissions also by 90%? I kind of think, yeah, maybe not 90%, but you should respond adaptively to market conditions and the USD value of your token.
00:44:01.470 - 00:44:46.040, Speaker B: That's a good point, because I was going to say something semi adjacent to this, which was, I guess, what's the driver for Axlar wanting to do this? If they want to just lower inflation to fit the narrative or whatever, okay, that's a bad idea. But if they're just vastly overpaying for no particular reason, then yeah, absolutely. My understanding is the inflation goes to the node operators because they're running a ton of infrastructure. And if you cut inflation to the point where it becomes unprofitable and you get a smaller validator set, bad idea. But if you can cut it without losing any sort of, without any degradation of your validator set, then yeah, if you're inflating for nothing, that's equally as silly as deflating for nothing.
00:44:46.970 - 00:45:47.482, Speaker A: Agreed? Yes. I think everyone here, and correct me wrong, is in agreement that because issuance is a cost, right. We agree that lowering inflation is probably good if you could run a more lean protocol and a more lean marketplace, whatever you want to call it. But now to your point, is the deflation worth it? And probably not yet. It probably is not but people also, if you just take that axle into the treasury but you still want to fund development or what have you, that still does create potential supply overhangs on the asset. So the best thing is just continue finding institutional investors that will buy it OTC at a certain price for a discount and getting USDC in return. You have them on a longer term vesting, so that you keep kicking out the vesting schedule for certain allocation of axle tokens for the foreseeable future.
00:45:47.482 - 00:46:35.590, Speaker A: And then maybe at the ten year mark or something, you go, look, we have such adoption, we found product market fit and now we can actually start burning this axle as like a stock buyback program. But I also think that crypto protocols are going to achieve profitability, potentially profitability at a much quicker rate than web two tech giants have. Because these are like unlimited, scalable businesses. It's just code, right? So theoretically you're much more operational efficient. We'll see if that actually plays out over the next few years. But you can definitely see a world where crypto protocols are doing stock buybacks or distributing cash flow to their token holders way sooner than web two tech giants were able to distribute dividends or cash flow to their stockholders.
00:46:35.670 - 00:47:06.926, Speaker B: Yeah, there should be a lot less overhead to run the software as opposed to like a full scale business. I definitely am in alignment with you on that for sure. But let's move on to hot seat coolthrow. And that is by far the longest governance update we've ever had. So that's what happens when you get to be fair, the stride and the Cosmos hub merger is actually really cool. And I guess that's more of an acquisition than a merger. Just to clarify, I know there was some contention around nerd sniping over the word choice there on Twitter, so leave us alone.
00:47:06.926 - 00:47:48.070, Speaker B: We know the difference. I'll go first here. A couple of these are pretty long, so mine's relatively short. But I got a hot seat this week, and this one actually comes either a week or two after me putting thorchain on the cool throne, I got to put Thor swap a different protocol on the hot seat. So Thorchain is the base Cosmos SDK based app chain that operates more of like a deck bridge that allows for native swaps between different assets. We've had Chad Baraford on the podcast twice now discussing different upgrades, so be sure to check those out if you want more of an in depth explanation on how thorchain works. And Thor swap is the leading front end that sits on top of the Thor chain.
00:47:48.070 - 00:48:09.626, Speaker B: Network and allows users to interact with the protocol. There's a couple of other major front ends as well. Maybe like I saw there was like ten to 20, which that's news to me. I knew there was like two to three. So this is by far the largest. And they just announced that they're actually going to be halting their operations for a temporary pause. And they put out an announcement tweet, and I'll read this piece to you.
00:48:09.626 - 00:49:10.986, Speaker B: It says, yesterday, following careful evaluation of the situation, in consultation with advisors, legal counsel, law enforcement, the decision was made to temporarily transition the thorswap interface into maintenance mode. This action was taken to swiftly curtail any further potential illicit activity. Swaps are paused, but LP actions, their earn program, their borrow program, and their staking actions are all fully operational. So all they did was pause their swaps. And this is in response to an alleged north korean exploit that was being moved through Thor swap, the front end. And so basically what happened was there's a major exploit that occurred on Ethereum, then they used thorchain, specifically through Thor swap, to move their ethereum based assets over to bitcoin and then hitting the bitcoin mixers. And so this is a bit of an interesting situation because Thor chain and Thorswap were not the mixer themselves.
00:49:10.986 - 00:49:41.898, Speaker B: They were just like the highway that moved the bank robber from one country to another. And to use some sort of an analogy here, but they weren't the car. They didn't actually get them over to the. I don't know, analogy is falling apart. But the point is they didn't actually mix the funds. They were just the bridge to get them to bitcoin, which has the most popular mixers. And so they're obviously in some hot water here, especially the thorswap team is like doxxed.
00:49:41.898 - 00:50:09.914, Speaker B: I don't think they're us citizens, but don't quote me on that. Nonetheless, they're doxed individuals. And the allegation is their protocol helped North Koreans get the north korean exploiters. I think it might have been the Lazarus group actually move funds and launder them. And that is not good from a government standpoint, but also from a moral standpoint, you don't want to be helping bad actors do things. So some people are super, super upset. They're like, oh, my gosh, this is ridiculous.
00:50:09.914 - 00:50:43.914, Speaker B: But the reality is the founders don't want to go to jail. And that's a perfectly rational thought. And action. So I don't know, there's like this huge Tevano. She works for Metamask and is definitely one of the top security experts in the space. She put out a tweet that said something to the effect of like, guys, there's a huge spectrum between the two ends of full permissionless decentralization and pure government control. And you can't help bad actors, and we need to use incentives to help good people and hurt bad people.
00:50:43.914 - 00:51:10.100, Speaker B: And it's like, this is a hard problem to solve. But the reality is, if your protocol is helping the Lazarus group, you're going to get in hot water. And that's not a huge bar for me to take a mental hurdle of, that's bad. And I don't want to be a part of a system that's helping that either. To be completely honest, this is bad, but how do we, we are creating permissionless systems that help everybody equally. So it's like, God, this is such a tough problem.
00:51:12.310 - 00:51:24.886, Speaker C: First of all, I have a question. Actually, the tweets say that they temporarily transition the interface into maintenance mode. But does that mean that if I have the technical chops, I can still interact with the smart contracts or.
00:51:24.908 - 00:51:31.340, Speaker B: No, I don't know from the thorswap perspective, but you can absolutely still interact with thorchain itself.
00:51:31.790 - 00:52:14.722, Speaker C: Okay, gotcha. Because I think uniswap has a similar stance. Right? They can remove a token from the UI in the front end and make it invisible. But if you really wanted to, you could go on editor scan and still call the contract. In terms of what you mentioned about that sort of trade off between food decentralization and not wanting to fund North Korea's nuclear program, I think it's hard. To me, the best middle ground is some form of governance where you can blacklist contracts or certain wallet addresses from interacting with your set of smart contracts, just because that's a pretty straightforward thing to do. And I don't think those would be very contentious governance votes.
00:52:14.722 - 00:53:11.254, Speaker C: Like, do you want to blacklist North Korea's wallets from interacting with your protocol? Everyone should vote yes. Sure, that means that it isn't fully immutable, but also if your governance is decentralized enough, theoretically, that should mean that those set of actions in terms of banning wallet addresses shouldn't be sort of subject to government or regulator pressure because you can't just force token holders to vote a certain way. But of course, that execution layer where someone would need to manually blacklist that wallet is always like a risk. It's very possible that someone which should have the right to use doorsoft or door chain, a government comes in and says, like, hey, we know who you are. The protocol dev. We're going to extradite you, blah, blah, blah. And that's always, like, a point of centralization.
00:53:11.254 - 00:53:17.740, Speaker C: But I think it's a hard fatus. But, yeah, we should definitely stop funding North Korea's nuclear program.
00:53:18.350 - 00:53:50.630, Speaker B: Let's say we start up a fresh wallet, and then I run an exploit. Now I have these funds, and then I go to thorswap. That's a perpetual game of whack a mole to try to be blacklisting, which addresses. And that's a tough problem to solve, too. And I don't know. I mean, the other thing is, at the end of the day, that is censorship, but it's not at the base layer. And is that okay? Is that the trade off we're willing to make? So the Ethereum block still goes through without the censorship, but it's up to the app to make the censorship? I don't know.
00:53:50.780 - 00:54:29.346, Speaker C: I think in this case, just like the base layer, being censorship resistant is not enough, especially with sort of, like, sort of the original use case of crypto. It lets you escape dictatorships, blah, blah, blah. You need that census resistance at the app level for that type of stuff. It shouldn't be like some dictator somewhere has complete control or, I don't know, the Chinese Communist party says, hey, stop this person from using Ethereum and moving his funds around, and you don't want to piss off China. I feel like it does actually need to be at the app level, but I do not have a good solution for it right now.
00:54:29.448 - 00:55:19.460, Speaker A: I mean, not to bring in AI and stuff, but eventually you're going to have to have some type of TRM labs or chain analysis like AI solution that can immediately tell based on blacklisted addresses and things other wallets has interacted with, whether or not this is a bad actor. And it automatically updates the blacklist. And maybe token holders have the ability to veto a certain address, being like, oh, no, you messed up there. That is not like the address that you think it is. And allows kind of like governance to veto, but not necessarily generate the blacklist itself or the whitelist, for example. But the fact of the matter is, if Lazarus wanted to convert bitcoin to tether or to whatever they wanted, they'd figure out a way to do it. They would do some type of OTC deal off of some china black market.
00:55:19.460 - 00:55:52.410, Speaker A: It just so happens that DeFi allows and permissionless defi allows it to be easier. But if there's a will, there's a way. There's always going to be bad actors that are going to figure out ways to get around the rather I think at least defi you're able to trace the flow of funds. And I think that transparency that DeFi offers is a step in the right direction. That doing full how much illicit activity is done through cash. Right. So you're never going to be able to stop this.
00:55:52.410 - 00:56:14.850, Speaker A: And the biggest concern is that the governments, like the US government, goes after the node operators themselves of thorchain. And I really hope it doesn't get to that point. But unfortunately we've seen that government overreach is a thing. And if that happens, that could potentially be one of the largest future issues for the crypto industry at.
00:56:15.000 - 00:56:38.266, Speaker B: Right, right. And it wasn't that long ago that Lazarus was just using the avalanche bitcoin bridge to do basically the exact same thing. So it's like they're going to go where the liquidity is to your. And like I don't know the specifics of why they stopped doing that and why they kind of looked elsewhere. I don't know if they chewed through all the liquidity. I don't know if Avalanche did something to stop that. So I don't want to just make something up.
00:56:38.266 - 00:57:05.182, Speaker B: But it's my understanding that was happening and now they're kind of migrating to the next source that they can use. So to your point, maybe that's the perpetual game of whack a mole is like we just need to stop these exploits from being able to occur, which again, that's its own wormhole of answers. But I don't know, maybe we can leave this one there because it is like an open ended question of how do you solve any of these problems? And Renner effort. If you guys want to take the conversation and give your hot seat cool throne.
00:57:05.246 - 00:57:35.630, Speaker C: Yeah, I can go this week I have a hot seat, which is the Ethereum church cult. I don't really know what to call it these days. But basically they're having the lido discussion again for the 10th time this year on Twitter. At this point, I'm kind of bored by it. I'm like, okay, no one really cares. But obviously enough people care for it to be a very contentious debate that's happening in the Ethereum ecosystem right now. Basically we're having the same argument again.
00:57:35.630 - 00:58:23.760, Speaker C: Lido is becoming too big. Is it a problem for ethereum decentralization? Just to sort of set the baseline? LidO Currently, or staked e specifically, currently has around 32% of market share out of all eve staked. They have 31 node operators and each one of those node operators roughly has like 1% of all total eve staked. And I think the debate, don't quote me on this. This debate got started by Scott Sonardo this time and he basically said that someone using the system in an intended way and in good faith, but ends up being a threat to the system is a failure of the system. I don't think Lido did anything wrong. I think it's the incentive mechanisms that have a problem.
00:58:23.760 - 00:59:32.222, Speaker C: And I think one thing that most people in crypto can agree on is that liquid staking tokens have inherent centralizing forces due to the moneyness of the liquid staking token. And I think Lido is just responding rationally to the system incentives. And now there's like a whole other factor after that Vitalik blog post about enshrining and people are saying should we enshrine like a liquid staking mechanism or liquid staking module into the Ethereum based layer? And my personal gut feeling is no, you shouldn't enshrine a mechanism that will interfere with free market forces. That feels very wrong, that feels like almost like a trade commission, like the FTC coming in and saying like, hey, I'm going to break up your yeah, but obviously nowadays Ethereum is a lot more complex than it know, like say three years ago. There's a lot more stakeholders in the system, there is a lot more money at stake, and everyone has their own goals and incentives and it definitely is a hard debate to have. 100%. I have more thoughts, but I'll stop there first.
00:59:32.276 - 01:00:33.686, Speaker A: Ethereum did this to themselves. Do you think all those gigabrain that have been building on this for the past eight years ish that they would have realized that this was an issue and it's like, what is the Ethereum? I don't want to say the foundation is asleep at the wheel, but they kind of are because people have known this has been an issue for like two years now that Lido has been around and they're so focused on, I don't know, MeV burn to make Ethereum more ultrasound money instead of actually the real credible threat to Ethereum credible neutrality, which is not MeV burn. And it's literally like lido, liquid staking. But Ethereum is valuable because it has the best form of securing digital property rights. Crypto is all about digital property rights or property rights in an ever digitally growing economy. And the moment that Ethereum decides hey, that private entity is too strong and we're just going to absorb that inwards and enshrine that and pretty much like a state owned enterprise, take it over. That gets rid of the belief of private property in a digital world.
01:00:33.686 - 01:01:29.682, Speaker A: And in my opinion, if they do this, Ethereum crumbles. I honestly think the entire crypto space looks like a joke. If Ethereum does something that enshrines lido or liquid staking provider and tips the scales in favor of one or the other other proof of stake networks like Solana or the Cosmos hub or Avalanche, they never were built on this meme of credible neutrality. I fundamentally think that if Ethereum does something like this, especially with off chain governance, where you're never really sure who has say and who doesn't, the lines are know, I'd be very upset as someone that doesn't even really care that much about the ethereum ecosystem, personally, I'd be upset for the entire space. If Ethereum did this, I think it'd be really poor form. And they need to figure out a way to just at this point, Ethereum needs to align with Lido. Lido doesn't need to align with Ethereum.
01:01:29.682 - 01:01:54.660, Speaker A: Lido has fully shown that they're fully Ethereum aligned. And if anything, it's like these loud actors on the Ethereum side that I don't think speak for the wider community. But it's gotten to a point where it's like, can we just get along? Can we figure out ways around this? There needs to be a better way of communicating our frustration and figuring out a path forward.
01:01:56.070 - 01:02:46.710, Speaker B: I don't have any philosophical thing like insights here, but to me it's like, okay, it's like, all right, what are the implications of this, really? And you also have to think Lido is no different than any other DeFi protocol or really any protocol built on smart contracts today. It's not in its end state, it's not mature yet. So we also have to think about what's coming forward for it and what upgrades is it focused on. And Lido knows this is a hot point of contention. And they're not just like saying, all right, well, we're just going to take over the network and you're going to deal with it. I'll let Ren kind of elaborate here, but Hasi was just in the Lido forums giving a plan of like, hey, here's how we're going to decentralize, want to. They debate these different things, like dual token governance and giving Steth holders the ability to veto different proposals and whatnot.
01:02:46.710 - 01:02:51.134, Speaker B: There's a lot of different ideas about how to make Lido having a large stake.
01:02:51.182 - 01:02:51.634, Speaker A: Okay.
01:02:51.752 - 01:03:31.598, Speaker B: And that's hard for me to be like, oh, well, just because it's over the threshold of 33% and they can cause some turbulence in the network, that doesn't necessarily mean that's the be all, end all state. Today there's 31 node operators and they each have about 1.18% stake, with the last seven or so having slightly less than that. I don't know, that's tough for me to get all bent out of shape about. But I do understand why some of the core ETH devs have very philosophical debates about why this is okay or not okay. And they're obviously entitled to that. And that's why they've been building Ethereum for the last, what, nine years now? Ten years.
01:03:31.598 - 01:03:34.098, Speaker B: So I get it. I definitely get it.
01:03:34.264 - 01:03:56.674, Speaker C: I think the free market did free market things. I don't know why you're very surprised by that. And I think there's two things that I just fundamentally don't really get. One is that Lido is a business. I think everyone kind of understands that. And 99.9% of their profits come from Ethereum.
01:03:56.674 - 01:04:29.060, Speaker C: They know that Ethereum as like a credibility neutral base layer. If it loses that, then chances are the price of ETH goes down. And that also means they lose any profits that they were going to make and their cash flows nuked by 99% and they cease to exist. Sure, 32% is like a scary number, but it's not like Lido is going out there and saying like, oh ha, we can prevent finalization on Ethereum. Now we control you guys. It's very apparent that all of the actors within Lido are here for the benefit of Ethereum, and they've made that very clear.
01:04:30.070 - 01:04:55.354, Speaker B: Hold on, let me ask you a question on that point. Okay, so there's 31 node operators, and so let's say they had 40%. No, let's say they had exactly one third. If they all colluded together and made a decision that, hey, we're going to cause some finalization drama here, I'm assuming that that's possible, but that would take them all colluding together to do that, which they're financially motivated not to do.
01:04:55.552 - 01:05:30.246, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And they have 31 node operators today. It's probably some of the largest centralized exchanges. Coinbase, like, probably what, 17, $18 billion company is not going to take that risk of colluding with someone else because they themselves have something at stake. Sure. If you're like a super small node operator running like I don't know, like a $5 million fund, or you're just some random company that somehow got chosen to be a node operator. Sure, I could see why you might decide to collect together at new keep and then have a massive eve short on.
01:05:30.246 - 01:06:33.578, Speaker C: But there's also large node operators which party I think is a good thing, to be honest. Obviously we want to see more home stakers, but then again, lido onboards node operators at a decently frequent rate and with new technologies such as DVT permission and staking modules, has to explicitly outlines that their goal is to have 5000 node operators in three years time. That's very different from 31 node operators, which today are very decentralized already. It would take an incredible amount of coordination from the node operators or global regulatory bodies across the world in order for them to collude and just mess with Ethereum. And yeah, like you mentioned, Hasu put out a great post the other day on the Lido forums about sort of proposed goals for Lido dao to know. They say Lido's main goal is to keep Ethereum decentralized, accessible and resistant to censorship. And I think they've really thought this through, to be honest.
01:06:33.578 - 01:07:17.970, Speaker C: Lido has an ongoing scorecard on the website where they say, what have we done well? What have we done? Like, okay, but we can improve and what needs improvement? I'll read out some of these under what we're doing well, but can improve. One of them is no operator has more than 1% of the total stake. And they acknowledge that. Sure, like a few of the operators have between 1% and 2% of total eve stake. They're looking for geographic distribution and jurisdictional distribution. They're looking for distribution in on premise infrastructure and different cloud service providers. Client security node operators are disincentivized from acting maliciously, and that's from a slightly more like infrastructure and technical perspective, but also on the governance perspective, a lot of their needs improvement.
01:07:17.970 - 01:07:56.738, Speaker C: For example, Lidl governance have significant safeguards, which it doesn't really today. And there's a robust set of Lidl governance dedicates, which it also doesn't have. And I would argue that a good governance system requires a well incentivized and robust set of dedicates. And for example, staked deep. Being able to sort of veto potential governance votes, that's such a no brainer. And as a stake deep holder, I also wouldn't want to nukes whatever the price of ETH, because that would mean the price of my staked deep also goes down so there's just a lot of these things that lead me to believe that Lido's in it for good. I'm not that worried.
01:07:56.738 - 01:08:44.100, Speaker C: They're doing everything they can to sort of decentralize the node operator set, and they're aware of their constraints today. Sure. Hasu makes it very explicit in this form proposal that staked or these liquid staking tokens are money, right? And they compete on that, basically. And Hasley even goes so far to say serving only 30% of stakers is not a long term sustainable position in an environment with high network effects. And I think that's totally fair, that's totally rational, right? Even if one day staked e becomes 70% of all total e stake. Caveat here hassles go is 50% of stakers choose to stake with Lido in like three years. But even if staked, it becomes 70%.
01:08:44.100 - 01:09:18.000, Speaker C: There are benefits to the underlying liquidity and the network effects and a lack of fragmentation. If that's the case, I don't want a scenario where there's like 20 different liquid staking tokens, all with fragmented liquidity. And e foundation devs and researchers are like, oh my God, the liquid staking market is decentralized. We don't have a centralization risk anymore. Yay. But it's like a shit user experience. So, yeah, I'm really against whoever is saying, like, Lidl is a problem, right? I really don't think it's a problem.
01:09:19.170 - 01:10:13.280, Speaker A: I think in a full on chain economy, we also got to remember there's only so much on chain economic game theory you can do to prevent centralization forces of off chain market actors. And obviously we're working on some of this for what staking tax we're proposing for the hub. But the real thing I want to drive at is like, Lido is making a credible effort here. And it's obvious there are certain things maybe Ethereum can do to try to. I mean, I think Ethereum is kind of stuck because of this whole credible neutrality. But again, there's only so much economic on chain game theory you can do as long as there's reputations, there's off chain reputation at play here. And maybe there's certain mechanisms that Lido can do to further solve the principal agent problem between validators and delegates to ensure the long term viability of their protocol and long term viability and security of.
01:10:13.280 - 01:10:31.218, Speaker A: I mean, I think you explained it all, really. It's getting, it's also tiresome at this point. Lido is aligned with Ethereum. It's clear as day to the average person that's not super hopped up on this ethereum. Maxi meme.
01:10:31.394 - 01:11:08.626, Speaker B: Yeah, I just got one more thing and then, David, I'll kick it over to you for your cool throne this week. But I just want to clarify, just because this is a hotly debated topic and I want to make sure we get this piece right, is today there is 31 node operators, but none of them are actually centralized exchanges. That doesn't mean that there's not large companies operating these things. So just example, some of the names is like Block, Damon, all nodes. You have people like consensus and Nethermind as well as course one and jump crypto in there. So that's still true, but I just want to make sure there are no centralized exchanges that are currently running, David. But effort capital, I'll kick it over to you.
01:11:08.808 - 01:11:10.638, Speaker A: Is this the last hot seat cool throne?
01:11:10.734 - 01:11:11.602, Speaker B: Yeah, it is.
01:11:11.736 - 01:11:41.722, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so this is not crypto related, but on my cool throne I'm putting Lil Wayne and Drake this week. So Lil Wayne and Drake both released new albums and I'm super hyped up to listen over this weekend. So Lil Wayne dropped the fix before the six because I think his last album is the Carter Five. And then just this morning, Drake released for all the dogs. So I'm personally excited about this and I'm just putting them both on the cool throne because I always love listening to new music and I was kind of getting sick of my, my normal rotation.
01:11:41.866 - 01:11:49.980, Speaker B: Cool thrown before the listen. Follow effort capital on Twitter for more great music recommendations. But thanks a lot, guys, another great episode. See y'all next week.
