00:00:00.090 - 00:00:22.000, Speaker A: Monolithic chains have this negative network effect, where the more users there are, the more applications there are, the slower everything is, or basically, the more expensive everything is. It becomes, like, crowded and congested. And in a modular setup, we actually have these positive network effects, where the more users there are more applications, the more people running nodes, the more block size we can have.
00:00:24.530 - 00:00:56.366, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Today is April 10, and we have an awesome conversation lined up with Nick White, the former founder of Harmony and the current co founder of Celestia, where he spent his time building out a network of modular chains with Celestia focusing on data availability. But before we get into that, as always, we're joined by two members of the Blockworks research team, Zero X pibbles and effort capital, to join us for a little segment of hot seat cool throne effort. I'll pass it over to you to start us out.
00:00:56.388 - 00:00:56.686, Speaker A: Well, I have.
00:00:56.708 - 00:02:03.650, Speaker C: My hot seat this week is flashbots and the mev boost relay. So about a week ago today, from today, four to five searchers were actually front run by a block proposer for approximately 20 to 25 million. So, just a brief background on me V boost and PBS proposer builder separation. So, one of the core ideas of PBS is that the proposer, the block proposer, is not allowed to see the content of a block they're signing until they've signed the block. Reason being is if they see the content of a block, then they have the opportunity to actually front run whoever put the transactions in that block and ultimately can profit from the opportunity. Theoretically, the way PBS is set up today, it's extremely hard for a malicious block proposer to deconstruct a bundle, see what's inside the block content, and actually front run that block builder and searcher. For them to do this, they have to either double sign, which is a slashable event, or they have to submit a block before the mev boost relay is able to submit it to the network, which is extremely unlikely.
00:02:03.650 - 00:02:39.242, Speaker C: What ended up happening was this block proposer was able to reorder the transactions in a block and included new transactions that was not inside the block when the builder gave it to them. As part of the mev value chain in Ethereum today, pretty much it was a bug in the system for mev boost relay. There's an ongoing patch that the community has been working on. I'm not sure if it's live today. Like I said, this happened about a week ago. I'm pretty sure it's live today. But as of today, we found out that tether actually created a blacklist and has blacklisted the address that performed this exploit on me boost.
00:02:39.242 - 00:03:34.174, Speaker C: And that address had approximately $3 million of tether on it. And it's pretty interesting for tether to actually create this blacklist, because they're very careful with doing so. I think one of their arguments against USDC was that they were much more careful with blacklisting than USDC historically. So for them to do that, I think, is like a pretty big concern. And on top of that, flashbots, if you actually go on their GitHub, they just created their own blacklist for anyone to use flashbots as relay moving forward, if there's any bad actors in the space. So I think as a whole, PBS and MeV Boost is like, used by over 85% of the validators in the network today. Everyone thought it was relatively battle tested at this point, but we're already starting to see some issues in the system, and obviously down later in the roadmap for Ethereum, we want to see PBS enshrined in the protocol, following in the footsteps for all the work that Flashbots has done.
00:03:34.174 - 00:03:47.010, Speaker C: But maybe it's time for the community to realize that. Maybe it's just not yet ready to enshrine it into the protocol, because there's a lot of actors in the space that are all trying to figure out ways to exploit the system, so there's a lot of profit to be had.
00:03:47.080 - 00:04:48.002, Speaker D: Yeah, this is a pretty crazy instance of the attacker being the attackee or a little bit of, what's it saying? A taste of your own medicine, right? So mevbots notoriously tear apart users and extract value from their transactions. In most cases, they put up a ton of capital in doing so. Right? You can put up a million dollars just to come away with like a five to $10 profit. And that's kind of what happened here. This MEV bot put up a significant sum of value to extract just a couple of dollars of value, and the validator reordered the transactions in such a way that they could basically drain all of the funds from the MEV bot. So, I don't know, it's just like this little constant battle of how just the value chain of Ethereum and the players that are always looking to extract it. One thing I want to just make sure we point out is the flashbots blacklist was specifically for the relay, so it wasn't excluding that validator from the MeV boost protocol as a whole, which is important distinction, right? Because the relay is just one piece that anybody can pick any relay of their choosing.
00:04:48.002 - 00:05:23.346, Speaker D: But I just wanted to point that out that there is a little bit of a distinguish to make here. Right? And I did see some of that going around Twitter that, oh, they blacklisted. Ethereum's not decentralized and that's not really the takeaway to have here. But I agree with you effort as well. As you mentioned that the USDT blacklist, so they basically froze the funds of this validator that had taken these funds. And that's interesting, right? And I don't want to say this for sure implies that there was a court order or some legal ruling that forced them to do this, but that's exactly where my head goes. Tether probably had a reason that they had to do this.
00:05:23.346 - 00:05:45.802, Speaker D: I don't think they're trying to make a statement with this, but I don't know. So that's kind of my takeaway is I expect more news to come around the legal side of this, which sets a really interesting precedent. Right? If validators kind of misbehaving within a design system is considered an illegal offense, then I don't know if the takeaway of that is a good thing or a bad thing, but it's certainly something to chew on.
00:05:45.856 - 00:06:18.594, Speaker C: It's interesting because Ethereum is trying to create credibly neutral MEV solutions, and you could argue that they didn't do. To your point, Dan, they didn't do anything wrong. They did exactly. Code is law, right? They did exactly what the code allowed them to do, and now they're getting penalized for it, which I would argue is the exact opposite of credibly neutral. It's an opinionated approach to MeV saying you're only allowed to do what we think social consensus allows you to do, not necessarily what the code says you can do. So I think this is a really interesting event that happened. And again, I think it's good, though.
00:06:18.594 - 00:06:34.918, Speaker C: It's good that block creation is a purely adversarial environment. People are trying to poke holes in the system to find ways of exploiting it. It just shows that PBS and I think the entire me value chain for Ethereum just needs a lot more work until it's ready to be enshrined in the protocol.
00:06:35.014 - 00:07:01.342, Speaker B: Yeah, also positive too, that it wasn't enshrined in the protocol in the current state. And there's kind of a time period where it can be battle tested until it actually is. So I guess we can count our stripes and feel lucky about that one. And I also agree with Dan in respects to I'd be really hard pressed to believe this didn't come from an order. Like, I don't think tether is in the business of monitoring Ethereum and making sure everything is working exactly as intended. So definitely agree with you there, Dan.
00:07:01.406 - 00:07:44.858, Speaker D: Yeah, and one more interesting takeaway that came out of this was flashbots actually introduced just a little bit of latency into the process of mev boost and communicating with the relays to prevent this from happening again. It was kind of like a quick stop gap while we think of a more long term solution. And that actually just so barely increased the block time of Ethereum from about 12 seconds to 12.2. Which if you actually look at a chart of blocks created per day, it is like a noticeable downtick in the amount of blocks produced per day. So just as something to flag if you see a crazy chart floating around with all of a sudden there's less blocks being produced on Ethereum. It was like, oh, that's a red flag. But it was intentionally introduced because of this incident.
00:07:44.954 - 00:08:23.662, Speaker B: Yeah, that was a good find there, Dan. I guess I can take it over for my hot seat. I've got Jared Gray and sushiswap in the hot seat. This is pretty easy one for anyone who hopped online Saturday night saw that there was an exploit in a recently deployed routing contract. Not exactly everyone's favorite experience if you'd been using sushi swap over the last three or four days since it was deployed. But yeah, everyone basically needed to jump on and revoke their approvals to avoid being falling victim to the exploit. And I think it was in total about 1800 e that was taken away from sushi swap as a result of this.
00:08:23.662 - 00:09:01.866, Speaker B: This also comes shortly after Jared Gray, the head chef at sushi swap, got served a subpoena. So things aren't really looking great for sushiswap. I know in our newsletter today, Westy highlighted everything sushi's been through over the last year, and it is an exhaustive list. It's pretty crazy, but a good portion of the funds were recovered and they're working with the Lido dao to actually recover some more of the funds because some of them were sent to the Lido dao as mev payment. So it'll be interesting to see if they do return some of those funds to sushi. Kind of sets an interesting precedent. I don't really know where I fall on how I think this should play out.
00:09:01.866 - 00:09:21.726, Speaker B: It seems like a bad precedent set in some ways, but in other ways you want to make the sushi users whole. That's like an OG defi protocol. So I guess I'm curious, do you guys think they should do it? And then also, just on the topic of sushi, if you had to take a guess, what would you say in terms of price? Do you think it's higher or lower? In a year's time, you just got.
00:09:21.748 - 00:09:38.690, Speaker E: To throw the whole sushi protocol away. I'm sorry. Just start over. I think light Alito should not return those proceeds. That's business, kiddo.
00:09:38.850 - 00:10:02.906, Speaker D: Yeah, I actually agree with you there, pibbles. I don't know. It's like this responsibility, taking back the airdropped responsibility meme. That's kind of what just happened to this lido validator, right? They were just doing their job, validating blocks, won the Mev lottery, and now they have this problem on their hands. Like, what do we do with these funds? Like, they were exploited funds and now they're mine. But I did nothing wrong. And I kind of agree with you.
00:10:02.906 - 00:10:15.474, Speaker D: It's business as usual. This is part of the process. Would it be the right thing to do to give it back? Yeah, there might be some moral or ethical argument here, but I don't think they should have any legal responsibility. That's kind of the way I view it. What about you?
00:10:15.512 - 00:10:15.902, Speaker A: Effort?
00:10:15.966 - 00:10:37.458, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I second pibble's notion about throwing out sushi. Personal opinion, I think it's going to zero. Nobody uses a. It's not like winning product market fit, like in any category. Unfortunately, it's an OG defi protocol. I do not mean any personal disrespect. I don't know anyone that's using sushi.
00:10:37.458 - 00:11:19.718, Speaker C: Let's call what it is when it comes back to Lido paying back sushi holders. I think, again, it's nice if they do that, but I'm really curious. What happens today in the real world. If I steal money and let's say I go buy a house, is there some type of clawback mechanism, like, in the real world, for a legal entity, like an old house buyer that sold their house, do they have to give back the funds that were used in that transaction payment? I'm not sure. But again, it comes back to the rules of, like, code is law, or is it social consensus? If Ethereum is trying to be this credibly neutral platform, then it's just business, kiddo. Just like Bibble said. You can't say any better.
00:11:19.718 - 00:11:23.094, Speaker C: That's literally what it is. And I don't think Lido should have to pay back.
00:11:23.292 - 00:11:26.390, Speaker E: We're bringing the FDIC to the blockchain.
00:11:27.930 - 00:11:48.862, Speaker B: Yeah, strong agree with everything everyone said. I don't think Lido should have to return those funds. It's just kind of the way of the road. And also just for the listeners who aren't familiar, sushi is on a ton of different. So like, that was just a mess. For anyone who had used sushi swap over the last four days, it's on like ten to twelve different chains. So everyone was kind of worried if they had used sushi swap over the last few days.
00:11:48.862 - 00:11:53.002, Speaker B: But pibbles, I think I can kick it over to you now for your hot seater. Cool throne.
00:11:53.066 - 00:11:53.438, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:53.524 - 00:12:13.990, Speaker E: Hopping off of ethereum. We have Xnft backpack on. Salana is set to launch in the next week or two. They got a big saga launch for their crypto phone. This is a pretty big step for Solana. It's kind of the do or die moment. I think they put all their eggs in this basket.
00:12:13.990 - 00:12:41.438, Speaker E: Let's see what happens. I think Xnft backpack is super neat. There's going to be like the first Nft mint on the wallet happening by the end of this month. And it's really neat because you can just throw different dapps in there. Like, they have stuff like Aurora, which is like a Solano player in game. And even like Dexes, they have all the dapps living natively in the wallet. And then that wallet can also live on the saga phone.
00:12:41.438 - 00:12:58.242, Speaker E: So it's a totally new mobile experience and we do everything on our phones nowadays, so really excited to see how everything pans out. But this can also turn to a hot seat real fast if everything is just a catastrophe. So be super cool.
00:12:58.296 - 00:13:24.758, Speaker D: The saga phone specifically is something I'm super excited about. It's certainly not something that I purchased solely for the reason of. I'm of the belief I even took this with Tesla cars. Right when you're making this crazy revolutionary product, the first gen iteration is probably not something you want to own, but is very cool. And Tesla proved to be that. The cars fell apart. They're kind of shitty, but they worked and they operated and that was the major invention.
00:13:24.758 - 00:13:57.542, Speaker D: And then you fast forward to today and the car is in a much better place. And that's kind of how I view this phone is like, yeah, it's going to be a phone and it's going to work and it's going to have really cool features related to crypto, but it's still going to be clunky ux and not that smooth. So that's kind of like where my head's at in thinking about how it's going to work. But if the off chance that's not the case, and it's just like a fully functioning, awesome to use phone that has these crypto native features that will very quickly lead me to purchasing one, I'm pretty excited about it.
00:13:57.596 - 00:14:35.454, Speaker B: Yeah, Sean, agree. I'm excited as like, for smart contract platforms like Ethereum, I look at them as really focusing on trying to lower the validator requirements to actually participate in verifying the network. But Solana, for me, is the one chain that's actually trying to build products built towards consumers that people actually want to. And like, if we be completely real with ourselves, we have pretty much zero real world application for crypto, except stablecoins, I think is like maybe the one, you could argue, that has some really good product market fit outside of bitcoin. I think there's something there too. But yeah, I like the approach Solana is taking, and I'm excited to see how the saga phone ships. And I also want one of those mad lad nfts.
00:14:35.454 - 00:14:41.026, Speaker B: I think the art is actually pretty sweet. It gives me some peaky, blinder vibes for anyone who watched that show on Netflix.
00:14:41.138 - 00:15:14.554, Speaker D: Yeah, I can jump things over to my cool throne here. I'm also going out on a bit of a limb here and doing a preemptive cool throne. And I'm going to put anybody who held through the Chappella upgrade in the cool throne, because in my personal view, it's going to be just another nothing burger event. There's all these major hyped up things that we'd love to do. That in crypto is put all this attention around the next major thing, and then it happens. And just like this release, like, not a huge bearish event, not a huge bullish event. It's just like operations as normal.
00:15:14.554 - 00:15:49.820, Speaker D: And that is exactly what I expect to happen when the chapellum upgrade goes live. And so right now, just to give some stats, to give some context, there's about 18.1 million ETH staked, which equates to about $34 billion and 1.1 or $2 billion of additional ETH rewards. So the actual staking rewards that validators have accrued since being live on the beacon chain, in my view, that with rewards, are very likely to be withdrawn in a high capacity. Right. If you staked, let's say, six months ago, seven months ago, now you're actually trying to realize some of this value.
00:15:49.820 - 00:16:44.142, Speaker D: And so the rewards, yeah, 2 billion of sell pressure. Okay, that's like how many minutes of proof of work, consensus, security, okay, not a huge deal to see $2 billion of sell pressure in my view, and I'm not buying into the narrative of everybody is super eager to unstake and sell. Logically, that just doesn't add up. And I'll give you a bit to color as to why, right? If this upgrade was happening exactly twelve months ago, let's go eight months ago, and we're two months after the terra collapse, I'm terrified because the sentiment in that time was like, everything's going to zero, it's the end of the world. Like buckle up. And that was pretty much the case, right? Then three months after that FDX blew up, things just kept getting worse on a consistent basis. But if you made it through all of that, you're at what, like twelve months, 13 months into the bear market.
00:16:44.142 - 00:17:31.270, Speaker D: Now the light at the end of the tunnel can be seen by everybody. And I just really struggle to make the logical gap that people are going to withdraw their entire stake position en masse and proceed to just sell it. And Mark Zeller, who works for Ave Chan over in the Ave protocol, had a really good point on this. And you can actually see through some of the Eth clients, the software you're running to operate a node, you can actually see if people have already opted into getting into the line to withdraw. So you can't withdraw yet until the upgrade goes live, but you can actually get in line. And by getting in line you do sacrifice your future rewards. And so the upgrade is slated to go live Wednesday, April twelveth at about five or so a.
00:17:31.270 - 00:18:05.094, Speaker D: M. Eastern time. And this episode is going to go live somewhere around 7 hours after that. So we'll see how horribly this cool throne panned out. But so far there's been a very small, like an immaterial fraction of validators have already opted into that line. And at this point, all you're doing is basically electing to not receive one day and 12 hours worth of rewards. And if you wanted to be first in line to dump your whole position and sell it, that is very much a I need to be first game and nobody's taking up that opportunity.
00:18:05.094 - 00:18:23.200, Speaker D: So personal view, it's going to be a nothing burger. That doesn't mean that's going to be some massively bullish event, unless you're under the idea that this massive bearish event is already priced in and then just doesn't happen. But in my view, we're just going to keep trading sideways. And that's what's going to happen is again, just a big nothing burger recommend.
00:18:23.970 - 00:18:29.070, Speaker C: No preemptive cool thrones like these for the sake of our industry, and certainly.
00:18:29.140 - 00:18:31.120, Speaker D: Not financial advice either.
00:18:32.690 - 00:18:43.250, Speaker E: Yeah, we're actually going to just brick the entire Ethereum network. That's what effort said earlier. And this is going to be the biggest black swan in the history of Ethereum.
00:18:45.450 - 00:18:49.990, Speaker B: Let's hope not. Yeah, like effort said, for the sake of our industry.
00:18:52.010 - 00:19:29.026, Speaker C: I agree, though, Dan. Overwhelming majority of institutions that are not necessarily crypto native, but own bitcoin and ETH, they're not staking today, they're not taking the risk. They don't understand the technical hurdle, I guess, related to Chappella. They don't trust the Ethereum community, they don't trust crypto natives. They're just like, I'm going to wait and see if it goes well, I'm going to stake. If it doesn't, I'm just obviously going to probably sell my Eth. But assuming everything goes well, I have to imagine staked ETH goes up to over 20%, maybe not by a year end.
00:19:29.026 - 00:19:59.862, Speaker C: I mean, as of right now, it's on pace to do that even before Chappella. But heading into Chappella, you're still seeing more eth gank staked. It's not slowing down. So that leads me to believe that it's more of like a confidence event where people are going to realize that everything's good, let's stake our ETH. ETH becomes even more money, it becomes more of a yield bearing asset in the ecosystem. I see it as a bullish event for ETH and crypto as a whole. And obviously today we'll see how things pan out on Thursday.
00:19:59.862 - 00:20:14.654, Speaker C: But as of right now, the market was moving up higher on the news, like leading into Chappella. Whereas typically you would think that it would kind of be like a risk on event where the market was kind of sell off heading into it. So I think it's just an overall interesting market climate right now.
00:20:14.692 - 00:21:20.102, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the main withdrawals is honestly going to come from people who locked in their ETH like a year ago into really shitty structured products. So, for example, I've got $150 of ETH staked on Coinbase that's just been stuck there. And actually, now that I think about it, I haven't tried to actually convert that to CBE. But I think generally speaking, mainly people are going to be selling that. That entity is going to have to withdraw based on customer deposits, and then that customer is ultimately going to go to a decentralized derivative because it's a lot more useful and can be used in different applications. I guess that is another interesting thing to think about, though, with CBE that I just thought of is like, if there is no way to convert that staked ETH into CBE, if Coinbase doesn't automatically convert that to CBE for you, and then people do sell to get into decentralized alternatives, then maybe there'll be a nice little discount on. Like, I expect the real plays to actually come from little outlier situations like that, more so than I do if there's actually anything here with the unlocks actually opening up.
00:21:20.102 - 00:21:22.162, Speaker B: So. Agreed, Dan? Nothing burger?
00:21:22.226 - 00:21:22.406, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:22.428 - 00:21:52.714, Speaker D: And over this weekend, I actually saw CBE was still trading at about like a one, one and a half percent discount, which is pretty interesting, because if you look at Lido staked ETH, that's at. I think the peg I last checked was 0.9966 and Frax ETH, for example, 9991. I just wrote something about this earlier today, which is the only reason I just know those numbers off the top of my head. But then you see a whole one and a half percent discount on CBE. So maybe there is something there. I never dug in, it was over the weekend, so just didn't really open that chapter.
00:21:52.714 - 00:22:22.446, Speaker D: But that is an interesting thing to think about. And I want to say, but not 100% sure, that there was like a terms of service agreement that you had to opt in if you had that OG version of Coinbase staked ETH to kind of move that over into CB liquid staked ETh. So that could be something at play as well. But I think that's a great place to wrap the intro, guys. This was a fun one and super excited for the listeners to head over to this interview with Nick White. It was a super exciting conversation and you can really hear how motivated he is to just talk about Celestia. So super exciting.
00:22:22.446 - 00:22:38.890, Speaker D: And without further ado, Nick White. Welcome, everyone. Well, we are joined by Nick White, the co founder of Celestia. Nick, thank you so much for joining us today. We're super excited to dive into the weeds on everything Celestia is doing, but we'd love a quick little intro from you, kind of your background and what led you to founding Celestia.
00:22:38.970 - 00:22:51.300, Speaker A: Oh, thanks for having me, guys. I was listening to some of the previous episodes, and overall, like, the Blockworks podcast has really taken off as one of my top listen to podcasts recently. So you guys are doing a good job.
00:22:51.750 - 00:22:53.058, Speaker B: Love to hear it.
00:22:53.224 - 00:23:23.290, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm Nick. I'm the COO of Celestial Labs. I got into crypto back in 2018. Actually, originally in college, I studied electrical engineering, specifically, like neural networks. But I left AI because crypto just kind of grabbed me as this thing that was actually going to make the world a better place in that it's going to empower people to sort of be more self sovereign. And I've co founded this project called Harmony in 2018.
00:23:23.290 - 00:24:16.174, Speaker A: My whole vision was basically, this technology is so powerful, but it's not scalable, essentially, in the way that it's currently built. It's not going to be able to have the impact that I think it could have, because the reality is that not everyone will be able to have access to it. And so that's kind of been my mission since those days. And originally with harmony, we were trying to solve that using sharding. But I ended up realizing that sharding was not the right approach when I read this white paper called lazy Ledger back in 2020, which gave this whole new vision for how to build blockchains in a modular way that, in my mind, actually solved all the core problems of blockchain infrastructure and could be the foundation on which we could build truly scalable, decentralized networks. And so that's kind of been my thing since then. And now fast forward to 2023.
00:24:16.174 - 00:24:19.182, Speaker A: We're really close to launching main net. So stoked to be here.
00:24:19.236 - 00:24:33.266, Speaker B: So can you give us a background on the main problems that Celestia is actually trying to solve? And I'm also curious, how far away are we from some of this stuff coming to fruition? What do you actually see the typical architecture of blockchains looking like in, let's call it one to two years?
00:24:33.368 - 00:25:13.374, Speaker A: So, to understand what problem celestia solves, we have to first back up and talk about what problem do blockchains solve? Right. So blockchains are like a verifiable computer, meaning that anyone can look inside of what's happening on a blockchain and verify that the rules are being followed. And this is unique. It's something that you can't do in web two. In web two, like, for example, Facebook runs the Facebook application, you don't actually know what they're doing. You're just kind of a consumer, and they can make rules unilaterally and change things on you. And in web3, the thing that's different is that users actually kind of define the rules and enforce them.
00:25:13.374 - 00:26:06.274, Speaker A: And so why is that challenging? Is that if I, as a user, want to verify everything that's happening, I end up having to run more and more, like, have a bigger and bigger computer, the more things I need to verify. So, in a standard monolithic blockchain, as the amount of applications increases and the amount of transactions increase, I have to verify every single one of those transactions, every single one of those applications, and that doesn't scale. So the problem that celestia solves is that it allows you to actually have a ton of applications and have a bunch of transactions, and users are still able to verify them. So you preserve the core value proposition of what a blockchain is while still being able to increase the capacity of the network. So I can talk a little bit about how that works, if that's interesting.
00:26:06.392 - 00:26:07.378, Speaker B: Yeah, please do.
00:26:07.464 - 00:26:49.838, Speaker A: Yeah. So the way that it works in a monolithic blockchain is all the transactions get packaged into a block, and then attached with that block is a commitment to the new state of the chain. So let's say it's bitcoin. What kind of balances does everyone have? And obviously, if there's billions of people sending billions of transactions, the block size gets bigger. So there's more data in that block, and there's more transactions to verify one by one. So now if I'm an end user, I need to verify all of those things. I need to download the whole block, and then I need to re execute every transaction and then compare it to the state that the block commits to.
00:26:49.838 - 00:27:33.354, Speaker A: Right. And in a modular blockchain, you're able to break that problem into two separate things. So the first thing is that rather than reexecuting and verifying every transaction individually, you can actually use something called a roll up, which means that one computer, one node, can do all the verification for you and just show you a proof that the work that they did is correct. So you can tell for yourself without actually having to re execute every transaction, that the state is correct. So it's like, okay, I know that these are all the right balances. I don't have to actually do the work myself. But the thing is that in order for that whole construction to be secure, you still have to know that the block data was there, was available.
00:27:33.354 - 00:28:06.182, Speaker A: So, like, if in the previous monolithic world, you would have downloaded all those transactions, now instead of downloading them, you just have to make sure that they're there, that they were published on the Internet. And so that's its own separate problem that celestia solves, which is that the Celestia block data is made available in a way that nodes can check that very, in a very light way, so they can download less than 1% of the block and verify with 99.99% security that it is all available.
00:28:06.316 - 00:28:25.360, Speaker B: Okay, great. That's super helpful. Context. So if we look at the current state of roll ups on Ethereum today, though, would you say that they're kind of missing the forest for the trees by just trying to build out more low cost EVM block space and that data availability will become a bigger problem and that's the problem you're essentially trying to solve for. Is that like a fair take?
00:28:25.730 - 00:29:18.234, Speaker A: I think, yeah. At the end of the day, the ultimate bottleneck will always be data availability, like, just with a raw block space that's like the raw material on which every decentralized application will have to consume. But I think in terms of the difference in the vision between sort of Ethereum and I guess celestia, is that in celestia, we were able to start from the beginning with this insight in mind, which is that actually blockchains should be modular. This is the way that we should design them. And so we were able to basically throw everything out about how blockchains are typically built and start from scratch with a purely maximally modular design, essentially. So Celestia does no execution on the base layer. It's literally, well, the original paper was called lazy Ledger because it's a lazy blockchain.
00:29:18.234 - 00:29:39.974, Speaker A: It almost looks like it's pointless because it doesn't do anything except for making data available. And so we have this privileged position of being the first modular blockchain network where we were able to start from first principles and design from the ground up. So I think that's kind of the main difference.
00:29:40.172 - 00:30:19.294, Speaker D: Hey everyone, big announcement from the Blockworks podcast network. We're launching a new show called Lightspeed and hiring two hosts to come build it with us. Lightspeed is a show for builders focused on the use cases that will onboard the next generation of crypto users by taking learnings and inspiration from the garage days of Silicon Valley, we really want to capture the perspective from builders, because that's what the ethos of crypto is, content, experimentation, and relentless innovation to build products that users can't resist. If hosting a show like this sounds exciting to you, then head over to the careers page on Blockworks Co, which we have linked in the show notes. You can also reach out to me or Sam on Twitter to talk more about the opportunity. But overall, we're stoked about Lightspeed. So if you think you'd be a great host.
00:30:19.294 - 00:30:21.042, Speaker D: Please do not hesitate to reach out.
00:30:21.096 - 00:30:38.170, Speaker B: And then, in terms of cross chain composability, when you think about chains that utilize celestia for data availability, what are the main bottlenecks there? Is it required, for example, that any chain that wants to be composable with another chain that's using celestia also has to be using celestia for DA as well?
00:30:38.240 - 00:31:17.842, Speaker A: That's a good question. There's a great blog post that our co founder, Mustafa Albasam wrote called clusters. And in that he paints this sort of like, mental model of how interoperability looks. Right. And there's an impossibility result that is that two separate chains that don't share a common data availability layer can only interoperate with trust assumptions. So they basically have to either assume the other chain is honest or you can use some kind of committee in the middle. But there's no way to actually have trust minimized cross chain interoperability.
00:31:17.842 - 00:32:04.526, Speaker A: And one of the beautiful things about having a data availability layer like celestia is that two roll ups, if they share celestia or any common da layer, they can interoperate in a trustmonized way. So what we call that, the mental model that Mustafa used is clusters. So you have these clusters of chains that share this kind of, I don't know, border of security. And then whenever you want to bridge outside of that cluster, you have to end up making new trust assumptions. And this is really important for. It's not that important at today's scale of blockchains, let's say, when you only have maybe like ten that are out, ten legitimately used secure chains. But in the future, in the long term future that we believe in, there's going to be millions of blockchains.
00:32:04.526 - 00:32:37.706, Speaker A: And when you get to that scale, you're going to really want to make sure before you connect to a chain that it's within your cluster, so to speak, or you're going to be very selective about the chains that you bridge out to outside of your cluster. And so having one way to think about Celestia is not just that it's like this consumable resource of DA, but also that it's like this network. That's why we call it the modular blockchain network, is because it's sort of like all these modular blockchains that are plugged into celestia are all part of one unified ecosystem.
00:32:37.818 - 00:33:07.202, Speaker B: Okay, that's interesting. So that begs the question then, is this kind of a winner takes most space? Would you say, I know there's a lot of other providers like you have Eigenlair, you have Polygon avail, but when I'm thinking about it intuitively in my head, it's kind of like the more chains that are using your service, the more value that's accruing to that token, which is ultimately securing the data and ensuring that it's available. So would you say that this is kind of a winner takes most market, or do you think it's plenty of room and there'll be enough activity where a lot of different solutions can thrive?
00:33:07.266 - 00:33:57.638, Speaker A: That's a good question. I think long term you see a lot of power law distributions and lots of different areas of technology. I think there are network effects to data availability networks. I don't think security is the most important thing. I think it's more about sort of the ecosystem or I don't know that there's a lot of different dimensions, but I don't think security will end up being the one that sort of causes that flywheel necessarily. But in the short term, it's such early days and there's so much growth that I don't think it's important to think about it in that sort of negative sum mindset. I think it's very positive sum, and I think the more experimentation and the more different versions of data availability layers that people build, the better.
00:33:57.638 - 00:35:04.314, Speaker A: And also, frankly, there's just going to be a differentiation in terms of different features. So like data availability layers might have different consensus algorithms, or they might have different data availability schemes or different interfaces, and all those things might be useful for different kinds of applications. So role of developers might choose a data availability layer for other reasons essentially, than just these network effects. And so I think it's important that we kind of explore the trade off space here. And the interesting thing is that this trade off space basically has not been explored at all, because we're really entering in this new era. And so I think, and I hope that there's going to be a lot more projects choosing new interesting designs, essentially. And that's also one of the reasons why we have this saying modularism not maximalism, because we really believe that what we should be building are a bunch of different components for developers to choose from, and that we're building this for the end users and the developers.
00:35:04.314 - 00:35:13.214, Speaker A: And the more variety there is, the more trade offs they have to choose from, the better for everyone. So that's what we believe.
00:35:13.332 - 00:35:36.406, Speaker D: Yeah, that's an interesting point, but from the larger standpoint, that does bring up a good point around security, though. How does Celestia guarantee the accuracy of the information that other chains using celestia for their data availability can rely on that data? Is there some sort of economic guarantee, like a standard proof of stake system, or how do you guys think about kind of providing that security?
00:35:36.508 - 00:36:03.406, Speaker A: Yeah. So security is a topic that a lot of people in blockchain get wrong in that. So there's different dimensions of security, right. So you can't really bundle it into one thing and just say, this is security. Right. So there's a few different things that blockchains provide, and all these kind of get bundled into security. One is sort of like consensus, I would call this.
00:36:03.406 - 00:36:46.826, Speaker A: It's something that Nick Carter wrote this piece on way back. It's called settlement assurances. It's like, hey, once I've sent my transaction and it's included in a block, how settled is it? Like, how hard would it be to rewrite that transaction? Like, how costly would it be, essentially. So there's an economic cost if you want to revert the chain and reorg it and get rid of that transaction. And so that's one element of security and proof of stake, or any consensus algorithm. What it does is it provides you those settlement assurances once something. So in proof of work, every time there's a new block added, it's like, well, if you want to mine a new block, you have to pay all this energy to make a new block if you want to reorg the chain.
00:36:46.826 - 00:37:22.874, Speaker A: So there's actually an economic cost. And the deeper it goes, the bigger that cost become. In proof of stake, it's similar. It's that once that's in a block, if you wanted to fork the block, someone's going to have to basically burn a ton of their stake. And so there's that side of security, and that is dependent on the value of the token, the value that's staked on the network. Right. But really, the more important side of security is what I would call validity, essentially, which is like, is this block valid according to the rules that we've set out? Right.
00:37:22.874 - 00:38:19.130, Speaker A: And so this would be like in bitcoin. If I try to send a transaction that spends coins that I don't have, that's invalid. And this is really, I think, even more important than reorg resistance, because ultimately, if someone can just mint infinite coins or break the rules and steal all your money or something, then the whole point of the blockchain is basically pointless versus, like, a reorg, it's bad. It's like someone could do a double spend, but to me, that's orders of magnitude less bad than completely breaking all the rules. And so validity security in a blockchain is actually independent of the consensus mechanism or the value of the token at stake. It depends on basically people running full nodes. So how easy is it for someone to run a node that fully verifies the chain? And if you're running a node that fully verifies the chain, then you have true validity security, if you will.
00:38:19.130 - 00:39:33.614, Speaker A: And the beautiful thing about Celestia and modular blockchains is that we really emphasize that, which is we want all users to be first class citizens, so we want people to be able to verify the chain themselves. And they can do that of the modular blockchain using something like a smartphone, because you can run a data availability light node on your phone, you can run a roll up light node on your phone, and you can't do this, obviously, with Ethereum or Solana or any of the monolithic chains, because you actually have to run, you can't even run it on a laptop in a lot of these cases, you have to have like a cloud instance, and that's the only way you can verify the chain. Or even a lot of people in Ethereum just use an RPC endpoint. They just talk to someone else running a full node. So the whole security model of blockchains is completely broken in the monolithic model. And that's something that we want to fix in that sense, when people are talking about like, oh, well, the security of Ethereum is going to be bigger. It's true that the consensus security will be bigger if it has more value at stake, but the actual security from a user standpoint will be much lower unless they have these fully verifying light nodes.
00:39:33.662 - 00:39:58.700, Speaker B: Interesting. I think that's actually a good time to hop into, really what a light node is and what exactly you can do with them. I saw you tweet earlier, actually, definitely wasn't stalking your twitter before this, but I saw you tweet something along the lines of a smartphone with an App Store where you can pick different light clients to actually run. So can you kind of, I guess, just paint the vision of what light clients are and how you see them playing a role in the future?
00:39:59.070 - 00:40:41.738, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I'm really passionate about this, but the future of crypto, the way that I see it, is that everyone in the world with a smartphone literally can connect to this verifiable network of applications. And that can be payments, it can be defi, it can be literally anything. And it's like this peer to peer network that they can fully verify and transact with anyone else in the world in a trust minimized way. And I think modular blockchains are actually paving a way to get there. But what we need to do, we have now the technology. It's possible already to run a Celestia light node on a phone. Mustafa's done it.
00:40:41.738 - 00:41:04.426, Speaker A: Many people have done it. You have to have an Android phone, unfortunately, and maybe they'll put this in the Solana phone. I would love to see that. So it's possible. But now we have to make it really easy. So we have to make applications that people can just download and install and have them running. We need to do the same thing, not only for the Celestia light nodes, but for the roll up light clients.
00:41:04.426 - 00:41:45.886, Speaker A: Because Celestia, if you want to fully verify an application running on a modular stack, you have to run the data availability client. So you're sampling all the data. You also have to run the roll up client, which is that you are listening to the roll up chain and verifying the fraud or validity proofs. And so we need to make both of those very easy for people to do. And my vision for that is that there will be some sort of App Store, essentially like an app you can download, and it's running a celestial light client. And then at the same time, when you're like, oh, I want to start using this DFI app chain or roll up, you click download. All of a sudden, you start sampling and listening to that chain, too.
00:41:45.886 - 00:42:04.466, Speaker A: And so you can sort of choose what parts of the web3 ecosystem you want to participate in and verify. And I hope that people will be able to verify everything that they're part of, that they can be first class citizens of every network that they want to be part of.
00:42:04.568 - 00:42:27.994, Speaker B: So I know you guys are pretty tightly tied to Cosmos, of course. So how do you see Celestia's role playing a role in Cosmos for app specific chains versus, I guess, something like ethereum or something like a sovereign roll up? Where do you think most of the activity will occur and what is going to be, I guess, the most dominant architecture? And I know that's really hard to predict, but what's your best shot at it?
00:42:28.032 - 00:43:09.922, Speaker A: Good question. So, as people know, we are very aligned with the cosmos ecosystem. We've even built a lot of the Celestia blockchain with the Cosmos stack. So we use tendermint and Cosmos SDK to build the base of the Celestia chain. And I also, just want to make a side note here, because this keeps coming back up. But there's a difference between modular software and a modular blockchain protocol. So, like, Cosmos, for example, invented this idea of modular blockchain software, meaning that tendermint as a library, or not a library, but as like a piece of software, and Cosmos SDK, as another sort of, like, software stack, are modular.
00:43:09.922 - 00:44:02.378, Speaker A: They separate consensus from execution in the same way that Celestia separates consensus from execution. But in the protocol stack, and there's a big difference, which is that with the Cosmos SDK and tendermint, a lot of people build monolithic blockchains that don't actually like the blockchain, still is monolithic and not modular. Anyway, I just wanted to insert that for people's awareness. Now, the beautiful thing about where Celestia and Cosmos intersect is that we share this vision of sovereignty, which is that not everyone should be building their applications on one shared monolithic state machine. And there's a lot of reasons for that. One of them is that you want to have customizability, right? And it's not necessarily all the way to the app chain level, but let's say you just want to add new opcodes to the EVM. It's so difficult.
00:44:02.378 - 00:45:10.014, Speaker A: Why is it so difficult for them to add something like account abstraction or. There's been so many improvements to the EVM that people want, like parallelization. Why is it so hard? Because there's only one state machine that everyone has to share, and any changes could break everyone else's applications, so they necessarily have to move really slowly. And so the beauty of decoupling applications into their own chains is that you can actually experiment more and you can optimize your virtual machine to the kinds of things that you want to run. And I think that's heavily underexplored and something that we strongly believe in. The other thing is sovereignty itself, which is that if you're embedded into the Ethereum state machine, then you're kind of beholden to the Ethereum consensus, like social consensus. So if something happens to your application, you want to fork or upgrade or do something different, you have to convince all of the Ethereum community to go along with you, which now Ethereum is so large and diverse that it's basically never going to happen.
00:45:10.014 - 00:46:10.174, Speaker A: And so having your own chain is a really powerful thing that I think people will start to realize as so much better vision for the future of blockchains than having one monolithic state machine that everyone is wrapped up inside of, because everyone's going to be tied up and kind of constrained from that. The thing that's different about us and cosmos is that with cosmos, the challenge is two things. In order to launch a new chain, you have to bootstrap a new consensus network and a new proof of stake token. And that's a huge amount of work. You think that, oh, the hardest thing about launching a blockchain is software. It might have used to be that way, but now with the cosmos, SDK and tendermint is actually pretty easy, but you still have this high overhead of coordinating the social and financial side of it. And Celestia basically eliminates that by being this self service consensus network.
00:46:10.174 - 00:46:37.594, Speaker A: So you come to Celestia and you say, hey, I want to launch a chain. Oh, great, you already have this set up for me. I get consensus and data availability out of the box. I just have to write the logic essentially of my chain and then you take care of the rest. I don't have to issue a token. I don't have to worry about securing my network. And then the other thing is in know they have probably the best, I would say, interoperability standard today, which is IBC, and it works extremely well.
00:46:37.594 - 00:46:59.938, Speaker A: But as we talked about, in the future, when there's lots like thousands and millions of chains, IBC still makes that trust assumption. You're always kind of bridging outside of your cluster. And so Celestia also solves that problem, which is that it can be the security layer for the interchange and allow these different sovereign chains to talk to each other in a trust minimized way.
00:47:00.024 - 00:47:46.450, Speaker D: So, yeah, that's super interesting about the broader cosmos there and being that interoperability layer. I'm also curious. So last week we had Preston Evans on who came and talked to us about sovereign rollups and was very excited about using Celestia as the DA layer for sovereign rollups. A couple weeks back, we had John Adler on who's building fuel, and he was super excited about kind of plugging and playing that execution layer with Celestia and potentially another blockchain for settlement. And so when you look at all these options now, I'm curious, which ones are you most excited about or think have the most potential to be, like, very exciting or maybe where more users or more, I don't want to say users, but what is the most promising configuration of these modular pieces to make the best blockchain?
00:47:47.510 - 00:49:21.054, Speaker A: It's a good question and I don't want to cop out, but what I will say is I truly do believe in modularism not maximalism, in that people have been searching for a long time like, what is the ultimate perfect blockchain? You know what I mean? And it's like, no, it's Solana does all this stuff or, no, it's like, and this mentality is like there is one design to rule them all. And that is basically Celestia has taken the opposite approach as the antithesis to that, which is that there actually is no best design. The same way, if you ask a web developer what's the best, I don't know, setup for your thing? It's like, well, it depends, right? I'm going to first think about what am I trying to build? And then I'm going to go back from there and say, okay, these are the pieces I need and the components I can hook up, right? And so that's kind of the way that we see it, but within that there's a lot of different components to explore that seem like they will be very useful depending for different kinds of trade offs. Obviously the sovereign labs team, I think is really brilliant and I'm really excited for what they're building because I do think that in a lot of ways, like what Preston was saying on the like, ZK rollups have a lot of advantages when it comes to interoperability and all of that. And they're really easy to make light clients. So I'm very excited for that. I'm excited for more roll ups as a service kind of thing.
00:49:21.054 - 00:50:05.470, Speaker A: I actually think that there's a huge demand for people to be able to sort of like one click deploy and have all of that sort of taken care of. That is our end vision, is that my envision so similar to this App Store light client thing, that's like the user experience I want to see. The developer experience I want to see is you go to a portal and it's kind of like AWS and you choose all these different configurations. Like, okay, I need this much. I want this kind of vm, I want to have this kind of sequencer model, I want to have these kind of light clients or whatever. And then you just press go and then the chain magically spins up. You don't think about anything else and you're off to the races.
00:50:05.470 - 00:50:53.082, Speaker A: That's what I want to see. And I think there's going to be just a huge amount of demand for someone. Whoever really makes that developer experience just super crisp is going to do extremely well. And I guess another thing that I want to say is one of the most promising things. The thing that was most worrying me about this, of making this possible, was just the fact that spinning up a new sequencer set is obviously, everyone knows that a lot of chains right now are centralized sequencer optimism, arbitrary. Basically every roll up in existence right now is still centralized, and that's not good from aliveness and censorship resistance standpoint. And so we want to move towards more decentralized sequencer roll ups.
00:50:53.082 - 00:51:40.566, Speaker A: But the problem is, if you want to launch a decentralized sequencer roll up, it seemed like the only way to do that is to basically create a new sequencer set every time. And that kind of becomes almost the same problem as launching your own blockchain. And so I was very worried that, okay, this is going to make things kind of impractical or kind of decrease the value proposition that we were originally trying to go after. And the beautiful thing is that now I feel very confident we're going to solve that. There's all these new projects tackling decentralized sequencing, and there's some very compelling ways to actually solve the problem in a way that is decentralized and trust can, we can talk about that. But Astri obviously is one that recently announced there's espresso. There's a handful of other projects.
00:51:40.566 - 00:51:52.078, Speaker A: I think even flashbots might be looking into something similar with suave. So that's what I'm also really excited about. I think that's the next most important layer of the modular stack to get right.
00:51:52.244 - 00:52:30.054, Speaker B: Yeah, strong agree with that. We definitely need higher accountability, I guess, for decentralizing sequencers. But to play devil's advocate a little bit, arbitram and optimism have their native tokens, Arb and op, and everyone's like, oh, they'll accrue a lot of value as soon as the sequencers are decentralized with their token as like a proof of stake economic security model, or an MEV will be extracted that way. So I guess my question to you is, why would an l two want to use, let's say, a data availability service or a decentralized sequencer when their token is not involved in the value accrual process at all?
00:52:30.112 - 00:53:30.606, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. So Jesse from variant put out this really short blog post and tweet the other day, which is basically about like, networks versus libraries, right? And the point was that networks in web3 are fundamentally kind of new, in that we have a way to sort of generate economic value from networks and sort of have them be owned, and they have a reason to sort of have a token. And so forth, whereas there's also libraries where, for example, ERC 721 is a library, right. But it's very important and it's very useful, but you can't really build a network around it. Right. And I thought that this was a really good framing because it kind of articulated something that I've been thinking for a while. And why this is relevant to roll ups is that when I think about what a roll up is, at the end of the day, there's two sides of it.
00:53:30.606 - 00:54:39.642, Speaker A: One side is the library part, which is like, hey, here's the execution environment and here's sort of like the proof system and model that we're using to secure the roll up. And then in theory anyone could take that, they could take arbitram's code like the library side of it, fork it and deploy their own roll up. The only thing that's stopping people right now is the business license, for example. And then there's the network part, which is like, hey, I'm going to launch a roll up like the arbitrum main chain that is sort of like the network behind the technology that I built. Anyway, I think that it's true that if I am building a roll up and I want to sort of own this network, I guess I might want to sort of own like I need to justify having this token. And maybe the way to justify that is to sort of also run the sequencers and be a little bit more vertically integrated. But I think in the long term the average developer is going to be building, they're going to take the libraries, like things like what sovereign labs is doing with the sovereign SDK.
00:54:39.642 - 00:55:03.774, Speaker A: It's a library. Someone's going to be able to take that launch their own chain. And I don't think they might not even want to have a token. They might have a different kind of business model or use case. Or maybe the token is useful, but doesn't need to be justified for the sake of decentralized sequencers. It could be part of the built in application, for example, and that's the network that they're building. So I think it makes sense.
00:55:03.774 - 00:55:44.454, Speaker A: It's more scalable and secure long term when we pool resources, right? And I think having a shared sequencer network is another sort of natural sort of pooling of resources into one common network that people can launch on top of another few other things. Just while we're on the topic is you get a lot of benefits on using a shared sequencer, like cross chain. Composability between these different roll ups can be ensured because they're sharing the same set of nodes that are ordering their transactions. So there's a lot of reasons why I think shared sequencers will end up accruing a lot of the sort of roll up ecosystems.
00:55:44.582 - 00:56:10.878, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with you too. And it's almost like once one of those or two of those kind of gets that Lindy effect, then you're almost at a disadvantage not being on that same shared sequencer. Right. If you don't have that easy composability with all the economic activity that's happening, you kind of put yourself at a disadvantage. So that'd be an interesting state to see if we actually reach. But I want to back up a little bit there. And you mentioned that end state that you described with the developers logging into this portal and kind of like building your own chain with everything that exists.
00:56:10.878 - 00:56:16.534, Speaker D: And I'm curious to get your take. Where do you think Ethereum stands to really fall into in all this?
00:56:16.652 - 00:56:59.170, Speaker A: Good question. I mean, I think where Ethereum is going is actually very modular. They are basically moving to make the Ethereum base layer just like a DA layer. And so I think in that portal you'll be able to probably choose between different data availability layers to plug into. And I think Ethereum dank charting will be one of those layers. I think the only difference, again, going back to we touched on this earlier between, for example, Celestia's vision and Ethereum's, is that Ethereum does have this baked in execution layer, which is an advantage, but also a disadvantage. And so it's, again, it's a set of trade offs.
00:56:59.170 - 00:57:52.050, Speaker A: The advantage of having the Eth L1 execution is that you can have settlement, right? And there's this rich pool of assets and users that are already on the Eth L1. And now when you launch a roll up, you can have a bridge down to that ethel one. And it can be sort of like the root of the ecosystem, if you will. The disadvantages is that then you now have a more stateful sort of complex layer, one that's not as minimal or modular. And so Celestia's kind of choice is like to eliminate that and to be minimal, maximally modular. And so we don't have any execution. And so a lot of people are like, oh, well, then where am I supposed to settle my roll up? And actually we should talk a little bit more about smart contract versus sovereign rollups.
00:57:52.050 - 00:58:18.940, Speaker A: But basically Celestia thinks that in the long term, settlement should not be on the layer one. It should not be coupled with data availability and instead should be sort of its separate thing. And that's either settlement via sovereign roll ups or settlement on specific roll ups built on top of celestia that specialize in settlement rather than kind of enshrining something from day one.
00:58:19.310 - 00:58:32.800, Speaker B: So speaking of settlement Celestia, some people will argue one of the downfalls is that you can't have a two way trust minimized bridge. How would you respond to that? What are the trade offs and what are the benefits? Really?
00:58:33.170 - 00:59:05.194, Speaker A: Yeah. So I actually agree. And it's something that bothers me right now about Celestia right now is that we don't have a trust mini way of getting the Celestia token up a layer above to the ecosystem. We do have a way to do that. We can use IBC. Or again, I don't want people to get mistaken that there's no way to get the token up. It's very possible, but it's not going to be this trust minimized bridge, which anyway, by the way, none of the roll ups really have trust minimized bridges right now.
00:59:05.194 - 00:59:59.238, Speaker A: They all have multi sigs or for example, even arbitrum. A lot of them, the fraud proofs are not actually active. So I also just want to say that there aren't very many trust minimized bridges in the wild anyway. It is not really that different, but at least as of now, there isn't a trust minimized way to get the token up. However, we've actually come up with some really interesting ideas around how to do this. One is like, for example, we could do basically interchange staking, which is the cosmos version of restaking to create sort of like a parallel settlement chain or like a bridging chain that bridges up to roll ups. Or there was another interesting idea that we had recently, which is that we could, in the same way that what bitcoin is doing, we could have specific sort of operations within the state machine that can verify ZK proofs.
00:59:59.238 - 01:00:36.518, Speaker A: And by doing that, it's like a stateless way of us basically being able to bridge tokens in and out of the celestia base layer. And I think that's actually a really cool one. It will obviously take a little while to be built, but it's going to happen. It's just that the reason why we haven't committed to anything is that we want to do it in a way that preserves the minimalism of celestia, because we think that that's sacred. And so we're trying to figure out what is the right design that makes the right trade offs, essentially. So, yeah, hopefully that answers your question.
01:00:36.604 - 01:01:01.130, Speaker B: Yeah, it does. I'm curious, is the reason that you and your team is thinking about this is because you want to ensure there's enough, I guess, economic value around the celestia token so that it can secure the chain from an economic standpoint? I know you already mentioned earlier that you think there's other reasons to prioritize for security over the proof of stake value that can be slashed, but I'm curious if that's why you guys are thinking about a two way bridge.
01:01:01.210 - 01:01:44.800, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think of the celestia Token as being a very critical part of the overall modular ecosystem on top. And I think that there's going to be demand anyway to, I think, bridge it up and use it as collateral, or maybe even rolos may want to use it for fees or. I can't even imagine all the different ways that people might want to use the token aside from just staking. And so it seems very silly to me to limit the utility of the token simply to staking. And in the future, let's say there's like liquid staking derivatives. It's like, okay, well, I've staked my token, now I have this staking derivative. I want to actually use it in DeFi or what have you.
01:01:44.800 - 01:02:12.390, Speaker A: Basically, what I'm saying is, yes, I think it's important that the token can be free. Right. This is true even in traditional finance. If I have a bunch of apple shares, right. I also might borrow against them or what have you. Ultimately, it is an asset that I think should be able to be tapped into in lots of different ways.
01:02:12.540 - 01:02:40.602, Speaker B: Great. That's super helpful. This one's really in the weeds here, so hopefully it makes sense. I've read about, obviously, in the Ethereum roadmap, you're going to want to use erasure coding in order to sample the data and ensure that it was actually extended correctly. So you need these light clients to be able to check that in the case of Celestia. So everyone always talks about, oh, you need to use a. Need to download either a row or a column.
01:02:40.602 - 01:02:49.380, Speaker B: Can you kind of dive into that, how that process works and how you have the exact same security guarantees in terms of data availability under this kind of system?
01:02:50.150 - 01:03:00.230, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's a question about sort of Celestia's erasure coding in general, or is it just like Celestia versus. Compared to other DA schemes?
01:03:00.810 - 01:03:09.270, Speaker B: Yeah, Celestia compared to other DA schemes. Because I know as well you guys are using fraud proofs instead of ZK proofs. So I'm just kind of curious how the whole system ties.
01:03:13.050 - 01:04:08.890, Speaker A: Basically. So first we should frame how data availability sampling works. So the way that it works is that have this block data, which is the actual transaction data, and you want to make sure that all that data has been published. But again, you don't want to have to download all of it because it could be a lot of data and you might only have a phone. Like I'm not going to be able to download a ten megabyte block every 15 seconds. And so what you do is you take this square and you use something called erasure coding, which basically adds redundant data in such a way that I can reconstruct the original square with a very small subset of this extended data. And so what that means is now, if the validator wants to hide even a small amount of the square, like literally just like one bit of information, they need to hide a huge amount of the overall data that includes the extended square.
01:04:08.890 - 01:05:25.010, Speaker A: And so that's what makes it so now I can sample the block at different spots. And if the validator was hiding something from me, chances are, after 32 samples or so, if I never hit an unavailable spot, that means that with very high probability the whole block is available. That's in short, and summary, how data availability sampling works. Now, the kind of main difference between Celestia's approach and ethereum's is that is the kind of erasure coding technology that we choose to use. So in Celestia we use Reed Solomon erasure encoding, and in ethereum they use what's called KZG commitments. The difference there is that in erasure coding, it's possible for you to basically forge, to pretend like when you extend the data, you can do it in an honest way, which is like to actually do actually extend the data, or you can do it in a malicious way where it looks like you extended it, but actually, if someone then tried to use the data to reconstruct the original data, they couldn't. And so what you need to do is basically make sure that the ratio coding was done correctly.
01:05:25.010 - 01:06:15.846, Speaker A: What you need to do is if every time a block gets generated, the other full nodes download all the data and they check the erasure coding and make sure that it's correct. If it's incorrect, they generate what's called a bad erasure coding fraud proof. And they can send that fraud proof to all the light clients who can then say, okay, I'm going to ignore this block because the erasure coding is done incorrectly, because if you don't do that, they would sample the data and think the block is available. But in reality it's not because they couldn't reconstruct the original data, if you will. Now, in KZGs, the cool thing is that you can't do it incorrectly. The correctness is kind of there already from the beginning, so you don't need to send around a fraud proof. So it's very similar to the difference between an optimistic roll up versus a ZK roll up.
01:06:15.846 - 01:06:49.614, Speaker A: If you also, this is where the trade offs come in. The KZG openings are very expensive and slow to compute, and so it takes a shitload like a huge block builder to do that. And the latency can be really big. Obviously. I think they're working a lot on parallelization. It's very similar to ZK rollups, where you see a lot of hardware optimizations and trying to make this faster. And in the future, if KZG becomes viable and scalable, then it's something that we could absolutely switch to.
01:06:49.614 - 01:07:19.474, Speaker A: But for right now, it just doesn't seem like the best trade off, basically. And so we're going with the erasure coding approach. The other thing is that it's also possible to actually ZK prove erasure coding potentially. So it's something that we're actively researching. So in the future we might actually get the best of both worlds. And by the way, the erasure coding is doing Reed Solomon sort of. Erasure coding is extremely optimized and very fast and very scalable.
01:07:19.474 - 01:07:38.890, Speaker A: So if we want to scale to much larger blocks, we know that we can do that in an efficient way. Whereas if you want to scale up with larger blocks with KZG, it's like, holy crap, let's say 100 megabyte block in KZG is going to be super slow. So anyway, those are the trade offs. That's probably a little bit too in the weeds.
01:07:38.970 - 01:08:05.638, Speaker B: No, that was great. I really appreciate it. I guess I had it backwards. So I thought that posting fraud proofs, you're assuming all of it is valid until there's actually a fraud proof submitted. And I thought that ZK proofs were more instantaneous, but they're more gas intensive like you mentioned, so you kind of have to wait a longer period of time before you actually submit them. Is that what I'm getting? Is that where the actual delay comes from on the ZK side of things?
01:08:05.804 - 01:08:35.460, Speaker A: Yeah, with the fraud proof scheme, you have to wait a certain amount of time to elapse that you didn't see a fraud proof to count something as final. Right. And, and so that's where the delay comes from. On that side, it actually could be quite quick to generate that fraud proof. But you want to, just want to be safe from your perspective that a fraud proof is generated and it got circulated to you. On the ZK side, it's a little bit the opposite. It's like once I get the ZK proof or once I get the proof that it's valid, I'm good to go.
01:08:35.460 - 01:08:45.022, Speaker A: But it could take a while for them to generate the ZK proof to begin with because it's very expensive to generate these proofs.
01:08:45.086 - 01:08:59.850, Speaker B: Okay, understood. Thanks for clearing that up for me. So I guess my next question would be post 4844 on ethereum. What is the data availability capacity of Ethereum versus what Celestia will come launch in either the end of this year, 2024 sometime.
01:09:00.190 - 01:09:51.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw some threads about this on Twitter about the proto dang sharding like 4844 capacity. I didn't really understand. As far as I understand, they're adding 1 capacity. I could be totally wrong to each Ethereum block, which is a good amount of data, and I think is going to go very far to decreasing the cost for roll ups on Ethereum. In Celestia's case, when we launch, we're going to have a maximum block size of eight megabytes. And so that's going to be, I don't know, it's hard for me to compare. I think the main thing that people need to realize, right, because we get into these arguments also with people about from the salana camp, which is like, oh, Salana has all this throughput.
01:09:51.270 - 01:10:42.742, Speaker A: And then they take the eight megabytes every 15 seconds, which is Celestia's initial sort of like block size and block time. And they say like, oh, that's only x number of megabytes per second of throughput. And the thing is that it's like apples and oranges in the sense that the whole point of building a data availability layer and doing modular blockchains is that there is no fixed throughput. You can increase the throughput as there's more nodes online. So we can actually flip a switch and say, hey, actually, you know what? We're going to change from eight megabyte blocks to 32 megabyte blocks, right? We can continue to increase the block size. And so even just thinking in that mindset of like, oh, what is the capacity is kind of a misnomer. And the thing about, again, getting back to 4844 is that it's not modular.
01:10:42.742 - 01:11:08.878, Speaker A: There's no data availability sampling. So this is like a one time increase. It's sort of like a band aid sort of fix to add a little more capacity. But it's not like they can just wake up tomorrow and be like, okay, there's more nodes on the network, we're going to increase the size again. They can't do that until a full dank sharding is shipped where they actually have true data availability sampling. And so that's really the core difference is that Celestia's block size is uncapped.
01:11:08.974 - 01:11:15.300, Speaker D: And you mentioned there that the parameter, the limitation was the number of nodes online. And can you just dive into why that's the case?
01:11:15.610 - 01:12:23.146, Speaker A: Sure. So in the way that these data availability sampling schemes work is that you as yourself sample a bunch of different points of the block, right. And then you know that if he was hiding something, then you probably would have found at least one of the ones you sampled would have been unavailable. Now the problem is that what the block producer could do is basically only let the sort of light sampling nodes sample data and not let anyone actually download the full block themselves. And so then what you need to do is you need to be able, for those light nodes that sampled to be able to basically put all their separate samples back together to reconstruct the original block. So you need to have enough light nodes that sampled enough data for you to reconstruct the original block. And so that's sort of like one of the security properties or requirements for this scheme to work.
01:12:23.146 - 01:13:07.538, Speaker A: So hopefully that answers your question. Then as you have more and more light nodes, more and more people like sampling on their smartphones, for example, all of a sudden you can start to increase the block size. And so the beauty of this is that monolithic chains have this negative network effect, where the more users there are, the more applications there are, the slower everything is, or basically the more expensive everything is. It becomes like crowded and congested. And in a modular setup, we actually have these positive network effects where the more users there are more applications, the more people running nodes, the more block size we can have. So we can actually have this positive feedback loop where we can continue to increase the block size to basically support more users and more applications.
01:13:07.634 - 01:13:40.514, Speaker D: No, that was perfect. I think that really helps paint the picture of why the number of light node sampling matters in this case. Right? And it's beautiful that it's like perfectly scalable like this too. But I want to change tune just a little bit here and one thing that was really hot on crypto Twitter over the past, maybe two months ago, one month ago, was roll kit. And really, the idea of using bitcoin as this DA layer, when you think about using bitcoin as a DA layer, is that something that's practical to you? Obviously, the ten minute block times are the first thing that comes to my mind, but I'm curious about how that whole framework works in your head.
01:13:40.632 - 01:14:16.046, Speaker A: Yeah, this again comes back to, well, let me give a background on what roll kit is. So, like, back in 2021, when the project was still quite in an early stage. So there were a bunch of roll up teams building on Ethereum. Right, but they were building specifically, they weren't building roll up software that was generalizable, that anyone could take to launch their own roll up. They were building their own kind of proprietary stacks, essentially. And so we saw that as a problem because our vision is like, everyone should be able to deploy a roll up. So we started with, started building something that was meant to achieve that.
01:14:16.046 - 01:15:00.246, Speaker A: And it kind of borrows a lot of inspiration from the cosmos stack, and that's now what roll kit is. But now fast forward to 2023. There's a bunch of people, like sovereign labs, for example, a ton of other teams building these sort of like, roll up sdks that share that vision, because we really believe in being credibly neutral. Modulism, not maximalism. We've spun roll kit out into its own separate thing so that we can be independent and neutral. But anyway, rollkit made a bit of a splash, as you said, when it basically integrated. Right now, it started with just integrating Celestia as a DA layer, but it recently integrated bitcoin and showed that you could deploy, for example, like an EVM based rollup on top of bitcoin.
01:15:00.246 - 01:15:44.326, Speaker A: And in terms of using bitcoin as a data availability layer, I think the interesting thing about this is that bitcoin has a ton of security. It has a really big ecosystem. And I also feel like bitcoin as an asset is kind of, like we said, kind of trapped on a chain with not much functionality. And if it could add more functionality, it could become like a more interesting ecosystem. And I think my hope is that this can kind of spark more innovation and conversation in the bitcoin community. But I still think there's a long way to go. Would bitcoin actually be useful as a DA layer compared to other solutions like Celestia or Ethereum? Like you said, that the block times are really slow.
01:15:44.326 - 01:16:11.954, Speaker A: The block capacity is also quite small, frankly, the data throughput is pretty minuscule, but I still think it's worth doing. And in the future, I think basically the fate of every L1 is to eventually just become a DA layer because that is really like the root level of Blockchain is just consensus and data availability. So in the future I could see bitcoin kind of moving in that direction too, potentially, I don't know. Right.
01:16:11.992 - 01:16:46.890, Speaker D: No, I like your points there. I just quickly checked and there's about four and a half billion dollars of wrap bitcoin on Ethereum. So there seems to be some sort of demand to get a more interesting use case for bitcoin. But no, that paints a great picture there. And I kind of agree, though it's almost interesting because Ethereum would be doing less than it is today if it was just a DA later, whereas bitcoin would be doing more right today. It's just a proof of work chain, but kind of like adding that data availability function would be an exciting development. And I'm definitely in the camp of seeing more innovation in the bitcoin space would be super exciting.
01:16:46.970 - 01:17:08.918, Speaker B: Yeah, strong agree there. Dan. I have one more question for you before you go, Nick, and that's oracles. Have you thought at all about how Celestia could improve the current oracle landscape? I know that's super niche question, so no worries if you don't have an answer for it, but I just kind of view that as like an achilles heel of Defi. And I'm curious if Celestia and data availability services would help at all on that front.
01:17:09.004 - 01:17:55.518, Speaker A: Good question. I don't think about oracles that much. I mean, it's its own rabbit hole. I feel like in technical problem to solve, I do think that one thing that could be interesting in the way that oracles intersect with the modular stack is sort of just on the app chain side of things, which is that what I would love to see is someone who builds an oracle chain or roll up. I would say on top of Celestia that anyone, when they launch their roll up, can easily tap into and integrate and have sort of a trust minimized bridge with. And I think that that's sort of like the future of where I think roll up should go. It shouldn't be like a new roll up on every chain or deploying a contract on every single chain that needs an oracle.
01:17:55.518 - 01:18:20.860, Speaker A: It could be like some kind of out of the box sort of like roll up. Like Oracle as a service kind of roll up. And I think that's a lot of like, I think the future of the modular stack is going to have a lot of chains like that that are sort of like they specialize in one service that they sort of provide to the broader ecosystem. And I think Oracle is obviously like a very natural fit for that kind of.
01:18:22.750 - 01:18:23.162, Speaker B: Use.
01:18:23.216 - 01:18:23.722, Speaker A: Case.
01:18:23.856 - 01:18:32.570, Speaker B: Super interesting. Well, we're really excited to see how the project progresses. I guess you want to give us a timeline and then also where people can find out to learn more about you and Celestia.
01:18:32.650 - 01:19:17.034, Speaker A: Yeah, so as people might be aware, we are currently running our incentivized testnet, the block space race. We are a few weeks into the process and there's like another month or so left. And that's really exciting because we have hundreds of nodes running. We have, I think 800 light nodes. So all over the world, it's the biggest live data availability sampling network to ever be created. So it's really exciting too, because basically this is the last step before we actually launch the real network like Mainnet. And so I'm excited to see how the block space race goes and what kind of bugs we find and so forth.
01:19:17.034 - 01:19:59.914, Speaker A: And then depending on that, hopefully we will be able to launch main net later this year. So that's going to be a really historic moment because to me it's like the first modular l one to really be birthed. And I'm hoping that this is sort of like a turning point in which the broader blockchain ecosystem starts to. We've been talking about modular blockchains for years now and I want to see them actually be live and be used. And I think there's definitely a lot of kinks to work out. This is a whole new paradigm. There's a ton of stuff to be built, not just on the celestial layer, but all the execution, settlement, shared sequencers, like wallets, all this stuff.
01:19:59.914 - 01:20:47.594, Speaker A: There's so much to build, but it's exciting to know that this is kind of like the first step. And there's a whole movement of people building projects that are aligned with this and it just kind of feels unstoppable at this point because enough people are modular, pilled and there's just so much momentum behind this new sort of mental model and paradigm of blockchains. And I think that the main net launch is really going to be one of the sparks that hopefully lights this flame. And so I'm excited to see where that goes in terms of following. Like I would say Twitter is the best place. I'm Nick White, but instead of the I, it's an eight and then we have celestia.org is our main account and we're always sharing things.
01:20:47.594 - 01:21:28.278, Speaker A: I encourage people, if you're interested, to learn more about modular blockchains. We have a learn modular section on our website. So it's celestia.org slash learn. There's a lot of really good articles there and know I try to also sort of share my insights when I can and if anyone has any questions, we love when people hop on the forum and ask questions or just tag us on Twitter. Because really, this movement depends on people kind of like learning and understanding the philosophy and the design principles of modularity. And we're still so early on in this whole process of sort of like, activating people's minds in this new way of thinking.
01:21:28.278 - 01:21:47.406, Speaker A: Because it is a little bit, if you come from the monolithic standpoint, it doesn't really make sense at first. So you have to put in the effort of learning a new way of thinking. But it's so fun and addicting. Once you go down the rabbit hole and you become modular pilled, you never come back. So, yeah, love to modular pill more people, basically.
01:21:47.508 - 01:22:05.462, Speaker D: Absolutely. Well, we'll definitely play our part in helping you with that. You mentioned two really great blog posts in the middle of this interview, and so we'll definitely link those in the description. But Nick, thanks for coming on, man. It was a pleasure talking to you. And honestly, just hearing the passion in your voice about what you're building gets me so fired up to keep doing what we're doing as well. So, Nick, thanks a lot for joining us, man.
