00:00:00.090 - 00:00:30.246, Speaker A: Arbitrum trades at a 1000 price to earnings ratio today. So if you turned on, like, staking for sequence of profits, that would be 0.1% staking yield a year, you know, and, and now if I'm very used to like 10% of staking yield after one year, and arbitram is like, oh my God, guys, we're gonna be the first LT to turn on arbitrage, staking for sequence of profits. An additional bonus, 0.1% on the 10% you're getting. Like, oh my God, that's so late. I'm out of here.
00:00:30.348 - 00:00:34.214, Speaker B: I don't know. I think you guys are mid curving this. I'm definitely right.
00:00:34.412 - 00:00:35.880, Speaker C: I love that energy.
00:00:38.250 - 00:00:58.126, Speaker D: Hey, everyone, Sam and Dan here. And before we dive into today's episode, I wanted to shout out metamask portfolio. Are you always constantly stressed like us, managing your portfolio across different chains, wallets, lp positions, perps positions? I'm excited to tell you about metamask portfolio, which lets you manage all of your crypto assets across different networks, wallets all in one place.
00:00:58.228 - 00:01:03.758, Speaker C: Do more with web3 your way with Metamask portfolio. You'll hear a little bit more about it later in the show.
00:01:03.844 - 00:01:41.598, Speaker D: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Before we dive into today's episode, a quick word from our sponsor, Hexons, the most hardcore security team in web3.

Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We've got an awesome analyst roundtable episode lined up for you today. Today is October 30, and we are joined by Brick and Ren from the Blockworks research team.
00:01:41.598 - 00:02:11.078, Speaker D: You also can use code Zero X research ten at checkout when signing up for a Blockworks research subscription@blockworksresearch.com. We just put out two awesome dashboards, one highlighting the token migrations for DyDx and poll, as well as a new Zksync era dashboard. So be sure to check those out if you sign up using that code zero x research ten. We will also put a link to that stuff in the show notes. But Dan, do you want to walk us through some of the biggest movers and losers of the week?
00:02:11.244 - 00:02:31.562, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. We got a good episode lined up. So excited to kick things off. So on the mover side of things, we got some token burners this week. So Pepe will start off with the meme coin side of things. Pepe burned 6.9 trillion tokens from a multi sig on October 23, and that's about 1.6%
00:02:31.562 - 00:03:10.150, Speaker C: of the total supply. Roughly at the time it was about $5.5 million usd, and the token actually jumped 31% following the burn. Now, this was actually timed pretty nicely with the markets heating up a little bit, as they have over the past week or so, but the token is still up about 80% in the past 14 days, and the team still holds 3.8 trillion tokens, which is now valued at about 5 million. So interesting to see a little bit of a burn narrative. Last time brick was on, we did get some discussion around how useful is token burning when it comes to a revenue return mechanism.
00:03:10.150 - 00:04:06.714, Speaker C: But this is a very different type of burning where it's just like kind of removing team tokens from circulating supply. So definitely, I think partly why this was perceived differently than the market. I don't think anyone's looking at Pepe for any fundamental reasons, but if you remove tokens from the circulating supply, that's just going to be this bullish catalyst that traders are going to want to kind of jump on the train of. So Pepe making serious waves over the last couple of weeks, and this could be a reason why some of that action has been occurring. On the other side of things, we have thorchain, which we've discussed at length on a couple of different podcasts, as well as had Chad Baraford, one of the lead developers in that ecosystem, come on and describe the protocol as well as its new lending mechanism more recently. And that lending mechanism, one of the pieces there is when new borrows or new loans are opened, rune, the token, the native token of thorchain, is actually burned. And so about 1.5
00:04:06.714 - 00:05:05.854, Speaker C: million rune has been burnt since the lending protocol launched a few months ago. And while that's not a huge number in terms of total supply, there was originally 500 million rune tokens in circulation. So it's still like less than about a half percent. It's actually kind of being this again, it doesn't always have to be a huge amount of supply to create that narrative around like, oh, this protocol is burning tokens, let's put an extra eye on it. And again, because this rune is burnt through lending activity, we're still seeing bear market levels of activity when it comes to the amount of leverage people are taking on chain. So one and a half million over a month and a half or so in what is hopefully towards the end of a bear market is still pretty good. And so if you kind of fast forward that out, I think it's what most people are doing here and saying, okay, well, if we extrapolate that level of activity into a bull market, when people are a little more willing to take on chain leverage, maybe that's a little bit more of an exciting number.
00:05:05.854 - 00:05:42.202, Speaker C: And even burning like 1% of the total supply at about 5 million. Rune be a pretty interesting metric to kind of keep an eye out and follow. And again, this one is kind of parlaying into price action as well with Thor chain up about three x off the lows, and it's really been just on a run since the lending protocol itself launched. But one thing to note here is there's definitely some, a bit of a regulatory overhang. They're trying to do bridging in a way that nobody else has, which isn't inherently bad. But there's an interesting kind of dilemma that gets faced. If you're a really good bridge, you're going to have illicit activity take place.
00:05:42.202 - 00:06:31.782, Speaker C: And that's kind of been something that's plaguing thorchain for the last couple of weeks. We saw some Lazarus, what is believed to be Lazarus wallets, kind of moving over thorchain from ethereum to bitcoin and then hitting some bitcoin mixers. So it's like thorchain wasn't the one actually obfuscating the identity of the wallets because you can see the destination and source chain wallets and connect it to. But it was like this highway that was used in this exploit. So it's kind of like this interesting thing to keep an eye out. The largest front end thorswap actually kind of had a response to this regulatory pressure. Token is looking pretty damaged there, honestly, from where it's ran up along with thorchain, to where the regulatory overhang kind of took impact, and it really only hit the front end side of things, which is Thor swap.
00:06:31.782 - 00:06:41.130, Speaker C: So something to keep an eye out there. But the top movers are two interesting categories that are both in two interesting protocols that both fall within the burn category.
00:06:41.630 - 00:07:18.918, Speaker A: I can talk a bit about losers, so I think friendtech was one of the larger losers last week. If you combine three, three and like an exponential pricing curves, once that starts to unravel, that unravels pretty damn quickly. So there were a few days last week where for the first time, active sellers were more than active buyers. I think there was a day specifically where 84% of the volume was sell volume, and that's a lot. 219 out of the top 250 keys fundamental price. TVR peaked at 51.5 million roughly and is currently sitting at 44 million.
00:07:18.918 - 00:08:00.774, Speaker A: Ever since fintech launch, you've seen clones launch on every single chain. To be honest, I think the most notable one was probably stars of Enon avalanche in a bad way because of the consecutive exploits that it sort of received and the bad publicity. But I think this is always bound to happen. It's kind of what you get when you apply an exponential pricing curve to being able to trade keys or shares of individuals. I do still like the idea. I think it's definitely fun for people to sort of take part in these private chats that you can only do so if you buy keys. And then there's been a lot of iterations around.
00:08:00.774 - 00:08:25.200, Speaker A: Know there's one on linear which had like, I don't know what, but yeah, it was basically like new interesting mechanisms were introduced on top of the core friend tech mechanism. And I do think there's more room for experimentation. Maybe the next bull market. I wouldn't be too surprised if there's one more city social fi app that just becomes huge for a prolonged period of time.
00:08:27.010 - 00:08:41.060, Speaker C: Sam, you never capitulated and got on Friendtech, but Brick and Ren, I know what my usage. If I plotted a chart of my daily usage of Friendtech, I know exactly what direction that line is pointing. But I'm curious, are you guys still super active on the app?
00:08:41.670 - 00:08:58.920, Speaker A: No, not really. To be honest, I don't think I ever was super active. I didn't have that many followers compared to some of the other analysts on the team. But I was in there for a bit, probably like one or two weeks. I was relatively more active. And then after that I was like, I can't be bothered with this.
00:09:00.330 - 00:09:37.666, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much the same for me. I don't know, there's just nothing to do on the app or it's like such a hassle. You kind of have to force yourself to go to the chat and talk to people and I don't know, there's just no way to naturally retain users, I feel like, because you can as well just go on a, I don't know, Telegram group or whatever, create that and have the same experience or even better experience. Because at one point I also got tired of the app since it didn't load and it signed me out, and there were all of these frictions, which quickly deter you from using the app, if that makes sense.
00:09:37.848 - 00:10:03.402, Speaker C: Yeah. And I feel like with a social media app, you have a window of opportunity that fades rather quickly. And it's like, if you can't create a sticky user in that small window, then you might be sol. Because a good example of that is be real. There was, like, an article on circulating around Twitter. I cannot remember where I saw anything about this or who wrote it, but just, like, talking about, I used to use b real every day. I thought it was so fun.
00:10:03.402 - 00:10:51.820, Speaker C: And then once it got boring, I haven't opened the app in months, and it's kind of like that great example of, like, if you can't create a sticky user, then they're going to dissipate really quickly, which is in contrast to something like Twitter, where everyone kind of has built, at least on crypto. There's such a community there that I think is really. That's what keeps me coming back, and I think it's really hard to replicate that into a paid environment. I don't want to have to pay to go talk to my friends, so I'm never going to connect with my friends because I don't need to pay them. So then it's like, how do I kind of kick start the community aspect of things if I don't have my core group of friends to go just jam on ideas with? So I don't know. Yeah, I always felt like there was something somewhere with friendtech, but its current form was never really overly intriguing to me.
00:10:52.830 - 00:11:43.100, Speaker D: Clubhouse is another good example of that. Like, and then Twitter just went ahead and incorporated spaces, and then that app died in, like, a week. So definitely agree with you there, Dan. I do think they get a little bit too much slack for the exponential bonding curve, especially once they launch a token, because if I'm not mistaken, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it's like, 20% of the fees go to protocol revenue. So I think that volatility is actually really good, especially once a token launches. Because if they do some Ponzi nomics and buy back the token and burn it again, there'll probably be a conversation in the movers at a future date. So I don't know, I think it could definitely be a good time to start looking at it again while everyone's kind of down on it in the anticipation of a token being launched based on their points in, like, four or five months.
00:11:43.950 - 00:11:57.890, Speaker C: I think it was only 10%, but I'd have to go back and look as well, because I think 20% was taken and then, like, 10% went to the owner of the keys and 10% goes to protocol treasury. I'd have to double check, though I'm not entirely positive.
00:11:58.390 - 00:12:40.426, Speaker A: I think it was 5% and 5%. I will clarify that. I'm also not too sure. And, yeah, as far as the points program goes, I think this trend first got started on Salana with margin Phi, and then a lot of other protocols joined the points gang. Yeah, I know one of the analysts on our team, pivotals, feels quite strongly against points program. I'm kind of in the middle. On one hand, it's a really good way for protocols to not commit themselves to certain airdrop parameters or even airdrop itself, and just to kind of tease an airdrop, but now, without having the intention to do an airdrop.
00:12:40.426 - 00:13:07.910, Speaker A: And so you move one step forward in their process of teasing points. But also, on the other hand, I also don't really like. I think with a lot of these points programs, you've seen that even if users have contributed a lot to protocol growth or whatever vanity metric that the protocol likes, in the end, users are getting a very small percentage of the token supply, and it's not impactful enough for the user that contributed to the protocol.
00:13:08.650 - 00:13:17.690, Speaker C: And just to set the record straight, Ren is correct. There's a 10% with split five and five between the key owner and the friend tech treasury.
00:13:18.350 - 00:13:45.138, Speaker D: I mean, still, though, everyone's talking about how bad it's doing. Yeah. And they had $100,000 of fee revenue the last 24 hours. I just pulled up DFI llama. That's top ten, top 15 over the last 24 hours, and that's when everyone's pretty down on it. So I think inserting a token in there could definitely reignite the interest. I just think people have attention spans of goldfish and crypto, so it's going to be a couple more months before we see that.
00:13:45.138 - 00:13:45.634, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:13:45.672 - 00:14:52.806, Speaker C: And Rand, I know you just mentioned Pibble's distaste for points programs as a seasoned airdrop farmer, but from the protocol perspective, I agree with man. Like, should you really be giving out such a large portion of your token allocation as a one time airdrop? And I tend to think the answer is probably no. There's, like, two different sides of that, right? Like, Uniswap did a pretty relatively large airdrop, and then one of its competitors, curve, took the opposite approach, which said, we're going to give a very small airdrop, but we're going to have a very large, ongoing incentive program. And of course, Uniswap has kind of been the monster there. But it makes you wonder, how pivotal was the airdrop in their success? And there's actually an upcoming speech or a talk at Dunecon. Exactly on this topic is like how airdrops have changed through time and how pivotal are they to a protocol of success? So I guess this turned into a little dune con chill, but definitely excited to kind of listen to that one. And if you're going to be in Dunecon next week, definitely reach out to either myself or westy.
00:14:52.806 - 00:15:23.422, Speaker C: We're going to be there and would love to meet up and talk crypto. What's up, everyone? As we explore today's blockchain landscape, let's take a moment to recognize Hexons, the premier cybersecurity provider in web3.

Don't forget to mention zero x research for a free web two pen test with your partnership, and you can reach out to Hexons at Hexons IO or find them on the ground at Devconnect. Without further ado, let's get back to today's episode.
00:15:44.086 - 00:16:14.158, Speaker C: It's probably a good time to jump sections here and keep the ball rolling with a governance update. So a couple good things going on. One of them is arbitram staking, which when we say staking in this context, referring to just taking a token and putting it in a reward contract. So you're not like, actually a security staking, if you will. Like you would with, say, staked eth. And so there's a proposal up where the yields can either be 1%, one and a half percent, or 1.75% in the form of the total arbitrum supply.
00:16:14.158 - 00:17:22.550, Speaker C: And it will initially use an inflation mechanism, but that can be altered to, say, the Dow treasury, because the arbitram token itself has the ability to turn on new token issuance and I think that's up to about 2% per year. And so even if, let's say the proposal was passed at 1%, that would just be a 1% total supply increase, which obviously, if not every token was staked into this contract, then you would be earning an outsized portion of the reward. So 1% could go a lot farther than on the actual end APR. So just something to keep in mind there, but kind of interesting because this could create a little bit of a supply sink because you do have to time lock your tokens into this contract as it currently stands. Again, this is just in the proposal phase, and the max lock is up to one year. So curious to get everyone's take on this, because right now, I guess there's a couple of different ways that I see it. All right, let's assume that if it's anywhere between one and 2% of total token supply, that's really not a huge number.
00:17:22.550 - 00:17:29.910, Speaker C: But if it's coming from new inflation or even the Dow treasury, how useful is that to the arbitrum token?
00:17:30.290 - 00:18:07.058, Speaker A: I think my one sentence takeaway is that it's so stupid. By locking up your Arp tokens into this reward contract, you are literally contributing nothing to, I guess, any set of stakeholders. To be honest, the foundation, the Dow, the ecosystem, maybe people that are trading are been holding it in hopes that your supply sink will offset some of the inflation or the supply becomes circulating or liquid once dows start using those for liquidity incentives or whatever. But my take is that it's very pointless.
00:18:07.154 - 00:18:49.986, Speaker B: I feel that the mechanism isn't that bad, especially if it's such a small percentage of the total supply. It's always better to do something than just let it have rest in a treasury or whatever without it doing anything. And even if it comes from inflation, I don't know. I don't really have a problem with that. It's just a good way to get tokens to lock up, and if they really don't have anything better to invest in at the moment, it seems that super popular thing to do right now is just give grants to protocols, which is also debatable, like how effective that is in the long term.
00:18:50.098 - 00:19:49.634, Speaker D: I would say my main tip with it is honestly just like the inflation rate based on the total supply as opposed to the supply actually sitting in users wallets. I can't remember the max supply off the top of my head, but there's really not that much supply circulating, especially if you kind of exclude the arb that's just sitting in the Dow treasury. If you look at just the arb sitting in liquidity pools in different individual users wallets, that inflation is actually going to be a lot higher than one, one and a half, or 2% sounds on paper, in my opinion. So I get the motivation to get people to lock up arb. So that way the price pumps short term, the value of incentives goes up short term. But I think long term, I don't know if that's really the best thing ever. I feel like they should maybe wait until there's a mechanism where ARB staking is actually needed to maybe decentralize the network, participate in fraud proof resolution or something along those lines other than just handing out tokens for the sake of handing out tokens.
00:19:49.762 - 00:20:46.700, Speaker C: Yeah, Sam, I think I wholeheartedly agree with you there, but brick, I want to get your rebuttal. But before we do that, I just want to put some numbers onto exactly what you just said. If 50% of the total circulating supply of AR right now was staked into this contract and there was just 1% of inflation was passed, so they're going to do 1% of FDV inflation and half of the total circulating supply was staked, that would equate to about a 16% APR staking yield. So to your point, there is a big mismatch there, and that does create a larger number. So you take this 1% inflation that everyone will feel, and you can kind of make a really attractive supply sink here. But again, how useful is that? Why do we need to do that? What are the main drivers? And brick, I'd love to get you to expand on why this is beneficial to maybe Arb token holders and the DAO as a whole.
00:20:47.390 - 00:21:24.680, Speaker B: I mean, it's just another way for investors to earn a yield. Maybe I'm thinking about this from the wrong perspective, but as an investor, I feel that I can either participate in this or not, and it's my own decision. I don't get inflated if I don't want to get inflated, if you know what I mean. I get what you guys are saying, that it might not be a good long term driver for the protocol, but. Okay, what's the alternative then? What else can you do? At this point?
00:21:25.370 - 00:22:00.578, Speaker C: I would say maybe you don't need to do anything right now. Like the sequencer is making a couple of million dollars every quarter. If you wanted to do some sort of revenue share, I think that could be a more interesting way to do it. Of course, you probably have a lower yield than inflating your token by 1% which in the grand scheme of things isn't very impactful. But it's just like, I don't get the why here. Okay, yeah, maybe this makes price go up and that's good in the short term, but it seems like a circular error here. Like, oh, we just issue new tokens to our own token for no particular reason.
00:22:00.744 - 00:22:34.494, Speaker A: Yeah. I also think no one's looking at say with like a 16% staking yield. If you were going to sell op tokens, you're still going to sell it even with that 16% staking yield. I think in terms of supply dynamics, that's not going to change someone's decision about whether they're going to buy or sell arbitram tokens that much. If I have Arb sitting in my wallet today and I was going to sell it, I'll sell it. It's not like I'm going to see this proposal. I'm going to, okay, maybe I'll get like 10% to 16% staking you and I'm not going to sell it.
00:22:34.494 - 00:22:39.950, Speaker A: Maybe I'm midcoming this, but I don't think it's that impact before the average investor decision.
00:22:40.770 - 00:23:25.578, Speaker C: That plus they're going to have, okay, if you fast forward to the long term, there will be some sort of decentralized sequencer. And if you really think zero knowledge proofs are the way, then eventually they're going to have to have some sort of approving system. And both of those things will, over the long term, need to be decentralized. So if that's the case, and we're going to to have, have an actual service that gets incentivized, then I would want to save this inflation for actually performing a service to the protocol, like incentivizing a decentralized sequencer, for example, then you're performing a service, it's related to the security of the network, and that should be incentivized through inflation. So that's kind of the way I would want to see new token issuance being used. As I'm thinking about it right now.
00:23:25.744 - 00:24:32.306, Speaker B: I was going to say, I think it's a great way though to, if you want to do that in the long term, this is a great way to start and kind of manage expectations. I've been lately looking at link for a bit, and I feel they're really good at this, where they're like, even though their native token might not accrue as much value as everybody thinks or whatever, they're really good at managing market expectations. By making these super forward looking optimistic outcomes. And in a way, I feel that this could be one of those things where if no arbitrum does it themselves, the community starts spinning up this narrative of like, okay, they're introducing staking now. When are they going to decentralize the sequencer? Is this going to be like a new revenue opportunity for us? And then it spirals from there. And as I said, I feel that if it's really 1% of the total supply a year, I don't feel that that's a bad cost or like it's a good risk return investment in that way.
00:24:32.408 - 00:25:24.290, Speaker A: All right, speaking of sort of setting expectations, then right now this expectation is, I think even if this goes through, even in the most bearish scenario, let's say staking yield is 10%, right? Then you sort of set that as your baseline expectation for ArV staking. And for example, if you turned on staking for sequencer profits today, right, arbitram checking our analytics dashboard, which you should definitely check out. Arbisham trades at a 1000 price to earnings ratio today. So if you turned on like, staking for sequence of profits, that would be 0.1% staking yield a year. And now if I'm very used to like 10% of staking yield after one year and average is like, oh my God, guys, we're going to be the first LT to turn on Arbitrum, staking for sequence of profits. An additional bonus, 0.1%
00:25:24.290 - 00:25:34.338, Speaker A: on the 10% yield you're getting. Oh my God, that's so lame. I'm out of here. If anything, I'd think like that may be slightly bearish in terms of setting expectations.
00:25:34.514 - 00:26:08.610, Speaker D: I was just going to say, basically you're discouraging activity by just telling people, hey, lock up tokens to earn more tokens. It's like if you really want to improve the entire ecosystem, increase sequence of revenue, it would make more sense to have people, LP, USDC, native USDC, because right now, USDCe has a bigger market share than native USDC with ARB. And then you lock up those LP tokens so there's more liquidity and then you can get rewards there. There's a lot of different things you could do that actually benefits the entire ecosystem more than just, all right, guys, here's your free, risk free 20% yield on Arb.
00:26:10.470 - 00:26:14.420, Speaker B: I don't know, I think you guys are mid curbing this. I'm definitely right.
00:26:16.310 - 00:27:05.460, Speaker C: I love that energy. But we'll leave things there for now and maybe check back once this proposal gets a little closer to maybe if it hits a snapshot, but we'll revisit this and see kind of where the Dow decides to move. But moving on, on the governance updates, we have an interesting one for CRV USD. So curve is actually discussing very much still in the ideation, like I would say this is very much an emerging proposal, very in discussion. The community is still saying like, hey, is this even a good idea? But they are thinking about distributing protocol revenue as CRV USD. So to give a little background here, for those who are a little less familiar with the curve ecosystem and kind of how it works, protocol revenue is distributed to VE CRV token holders. To get Ve CRV, you have to take regular crv tokens and lock them for up to four years.
00:27:05.460 - 00:28:01.666, Speaker C: And so 50% of all Dex fees go to token lockers, and 100% of all fees from the lending market go to the token lockers. Today, those fees are aggregated and then distributed to those VeCRV in the form of three pool LP tokens. As I'm saying this, it is so painful to say all these acronyms out loud, but here we are, this is what we're working with. So it gets consolidated into the lp token of a pool that contains USDC, USDT and DAI. All that really is to say is you're basically getting your fees protocol revenue distributed to you as stablecoins. And so right now the current yield is about 4%. It's kind of nontrivial to change the token, to be honest, because basically what happens is, especially on the Dex side of things, but even on the lending market side, the fees get paid in a variety of different tokens.
00:28:01.666 - 00:29:13.370, Speaker C: So when you swap, let's say, ETH to CRV, the fee payment will either be in ETH or CRV, and that ultimately needs to get swapped into a stablecoin to be distributed to the VE CRV lockers. And it's kind of nice to be getting your fees paid in stablecoins. It's definitely different than saying like, oh, we'll buy back crv and distribute that to the token holders. It's like, yeah, maybe that's good for CRv price in the short term, but people want to be paid in something useful, and largely that's stablecoins today. Or maybe like eth as well, would be interesting. And so the reason that the community is kind of discussing changing the fee token from this stablecoin lp position into CRV USD, which is the protocol's native stablecoin, is really to create additional and ultimately demand utility and demand for the stablecoin. And that's really important when you're creating a stablecoin, because ultimately market cap is a function of how many people want to hold your stablecoin, especially in a lending design based, CDP based stablecoin, where borrowing and lending must occur to mint new tokens.
00:29:13.370 - 00:29:51.466, Speaker C: If the price of your stablecoin is falling, then you're going to see people redeeming their loans, buying it back and redeeming their loans, which is lowers the market cap. If you're looking at stablecoin market cap, it's truly just a function of the demand to hold your stablecoin. And obviously price is very important in this equation. And so how this kind of creates more demand for the token is it's creating like a systemic buy pressure on the token, which ultimately raises the price. And the buy pressure is not necessarily a small amount. The curve token. I just pulled up coin gecko here, so I honestly want to double check how accurate this is.
00:29:51.466 - 00:30:50.134, Speaker C: But it says in the last 24 hours, there's about $15 million of trading volume on the CRV USD token, and there's roughly $325,000 of weekly fees. And so that is all getting converted into three curve, which creates buying pressure in the three pool. And if you're putting that directly onto CRV USD, then any fee that is collected in a token other than CRV USD will need to be swapped into CRV USD. So it's creating that systemic weekly buy pressure. And that's also presuming that the token holders that are currently being paid in a combination of USDC USDT and Dai are willing and excited about being paid in CRV USD instead. And it kind of has like this twofold impact on the token. I would say so curve has a really interesting interest rate model, where the price of CRV USD is a factor in the current interest rate paid by borrowers.
00:30:50.134 - 00:31:55.214, Speaker C: So it's not a function of governance at all. Governance can tweak some specific parameters, but the rate will freely update on its own. And so a higher CRV USD price will directly lower the fees paid by borrowers by shifting the equilibrium of the rate curve, and it will indirectly lower the interest rate by activating the Amos in the curve ecosystem, which will automatically deploy capital into the pools. And the act of deploying capital into pools also decreases the current rate. So it has this twofold effect on not only decreasing the current interest rate paid by borrowers, but also kind of creating this systemic demand for the token and curve seen some great success with its new lending market here. I think the total market cap is up to about 128,000,000 as of today, and it's been on a great pace, and so it'll be exciting to kind of watch this, see if it has any major impacts on the stablecoins growth. I know we talk a lot about go that launch at a similar time we talked a lot about go the other week, so we won't kind of try to make the comparisons here.
00:31:55.214 - 00:32:01.186, Speaker C: But curious if you guys have any thoughts on curve's lending market after I just spent that time rambling, I got.
00:32:01.208 - 00:32:24.490, Speaker D: A question, and this might be a dumb one, but does the interest rate ever go negative? And then if you're paid out CRV USD, is that fine to just hold in your wallet like you're not getting charged any interest? Then on top of that, obviously you don't want a DPEG to the upside and then screw borrowers over who then have to buy back that CRV USD and then repay their loan. So I guess that's kind of loaded, but how does that work?
00:32:24.640 - 00:33:02.594, Speaker C: Great question. So three questions. No, the interest rates are asymptotic to zero, so they cannot fall below zero. The second question, the only people that pay interest in the system are the active borrowers. So if you just went to a liquidity pool and bought CRV USD, you're just holding a stablecoin, similar to holding like DAi, when the stablecoin deep to the upside, that actually allows the Amos to kick in. And then they will basically sell unbacked CRV USD into the pools, and that lowers the price. I say sell, but they're really just making a single sided deposit of CRV USD.
00:33:02.594 - 00:33:18.250, Speaker C: So that brings the pool back into equilibrium, which is what they call deploying debt into these pools. And so the act of deploying debt based on the interest rate formula actually lowers the rates paid. So deploying debt is good for low rates.
00:33:21.260 - 00:33:22.232, Speaker D: That's pretty cool.
00:33:22.366 - 00:33:53.984, Speaker B: Do you think there's any big risks of this, like, deep into the downside? Because if I remember correctly, the big quote, unquote big dpeg a couple of months ago, the Amos always almost ran out of capital to buy back the stable coins. And if that would have happened, then the only thing that's anymore, like defending the peg, is the interest rate mechanism, right?
00:33:54.182 - 00:34:51.552, Speaker C: Right? Yep, that's exactly right. So the Amos are only useful for deepgs to the upside, just as like a PSM is, until it's empty, then there's nothing left to kind of sell and try to fight back when things deep to the downside, you're left with two things, like an interest rate mechanism to kind of incentivize activity and arbitrage from borrowers, right? Because if I borrow something at one and then I sell the stablecoin, and then let's say a huge DPEG happens and it depegs to $0.80. Let's just make up a number then when I go repurchase, I can buy what I sold for one dollars, I can buy it back for $0.80. Basically, like you're going short the thing you're borrowing effectively. And so that's one method and the other one is the interest rate mechanism, right? And so when the stablecoin dpegs to the downside, interest rates hyperbolically increase. And so if you get like a material DPEG, you're going to see a very large number in interest rates. And there's a cap, of course.
00:34:51.552 - 00:34:59.270, Speaker C: But deeping to 99 nine five is like you start seeing material movement in the interest rate.
00:34:59.800 - 00:35:13.256, Speaker B: Okay, maybe I misunderstood the mechanism then, because my understanding was that Amos start closing their positions, which decreases the stablecoin supply, which should bring the peg up again.
00:35:13.438 - 00:35:34.444, Speaker C: I guess it depends how you count stablecoin supply. Personally, when it comes to CDP stablecoins, I would really only count the circulating supply, that is, from actively borrowing the stablecoin. The pegkeepers deploying tokens. If I wanted to know the adoption and traction of a protocol, I wouldn't be interested in how much debt they've deployed into these pools.
00:35:34.572 - 00:35:40.196, Speaker B: Yeah, makes sense. But the total supply should still have an effect on the price, right?
00:35:40.378 - 00:35:42.390, Speaker C: Total supply? No, just price.
00:35:42.840 - 00:36:20.096, Speaker D: Frax, bulls and shambles. After that comment, Dan, I can take this last governance update if we're ready to move on past curve. So, osmosis just passed a proposal to incentivize DyDX liquidity. The pool will have a 0.5% swap fee, and the proposal suggests allocating 200,000 OSMO tokens towards incentivizing lps there. That's about $70,000 and it's over 50 days, so they would need to see roughly 100 and 4150 million dollars of volume in order to make back that spend in Osmo tokens to essentially make it a worthwhile venture. I personally love this.
00:36:20.096 - 00:36:39.990, Speaker D: I think there's going to be a ton of arab opportunities between the ETH Dydx coin that's locked in the bridge or circulating over on Ethereum versus the stuff that's going over on in Cosmos land. So I expect a bunch of volume here, and I think it'd be pretty good for osmosis in terms of pumping their volumes and fees. But curious if you guys have anything to add there.
00:36:40.840 - 00:37:35.656, Speaker A: I think just a few things that just briefly come to mind. I think liquid stake DyDX is going to be a pretty big thing. So I'm not sure whether osmosis is incentivizing Dy DX liquidity or like staked DydX liquidity, but it'd be interesting to see the direction they go. I know roughly $50 million of DyDX has migrated over from Ethereum so far, and the reason I know that is because Dan has built a great dashboard on our analytics, too. So if you're interested in how that's going, definitely check that out. But, yeah, I'm interested to see whether, for example, liquidity for staked DyDx will be more than DydX. And then just another completely random thing that comes to mind is if you're a centralized exchange and you're holding users balances in Dydx, do you also bridge all of that to the new app chain, or what do you do there?
00:37:35.838 - 00:37:48.430, Speaker D: I actually have no idea. You'd think that they'd migrate the tokens to the proper token standard, but maybe they'll be, like the last ones to do that, but not completely sure. That's a really good question.
00:37:49.680 - 00:38:19.524, Speaker C: Yeah, I like your point about the stake, Dyx. I agree. I think that's going to be a pretty hot token in the Cosmos defi ecosystem. But it's definitely a good move, right? If you're a Dex, you need to fight for liquidity. And I don't know, but I'm really curious what's going on on some of the Dexes on neutron like Astroport that really seems like it's going to be the main rival to osmosis in terms of who's going to win the liquidity wars for major assets over there. And so, yeah, I don't know how that's going. I don't know if they're making a push as well.
00:38:19.524 - 00:39:09.796, Speaker C: But DyDX is probably the most exciting DeFi asset in the cosmos ecosystem now and would be very interested to see kind of what that looks like. And the token migration thing is pretty interesting. So we've only seen about 5.9% of the supply migrate over, and one thing I'm interested in is to see if we get any weird price mismatches between the ETH version and the Cosmos version as a more meaningful amount of liquidity is migrated from ETH to cosmos because there's a really easy arbitrage if you need to move the asset from ETH to cosmos, but it's a one way bridge, so there's no going back. So I don't know how you'd kind of repeg it if the ETH asset got, like, crazy whack out of price. So I don't know. Definitely something I'm keeping an eye on.
00:39:09.796 - 00:39:18.036, Speaker C: I don't think I'm going to be trying to make any plays or anything by any means. That's definitely not financial advice, but just as like, a data junkie, I'm really curious to see how those two prices.
00:39:18.068 - 00:39:34.620, Speaker D: Match stride as well. Also, put up a governance proposal on the DyDX forums to basically, I can't remember exactly what the proposal is, but they're trying to get the DYDX LST live for them so that way they can start capturing some of that market. So that's another governance update to pay attention to.
00:39:34.690 - 00:40:03.344, Speaker C: All right, everyone, let's take a moment to hear about metamask portfolio. If you're like me and Sam, managing your crypto assets across different wallets and networks can be so overwhelmingly complicated. That's why we're excited about metamask portfolio.

00:40:11.198 - 00:40:17.900, Speaker D: Manage your portfolio your way with Metamask portfolio. Peep the link in the description of today's episode to get started.
00:40:17.970 - 00:40:20.824, Speaker C: Now, should we move to hot seat cool throne?
00:40:20.952 - 00:40:21.916, Speaker D: Let's do it.
00:40:22.018 - 00:40:24.076, Speaker C: All right, Ren, kick us off, man.
00:40:24.258 - 00:40:58.340, Speaker A: Sure. This week, I have Larry Zero in the hot seat. I especially wore my Larry Zero shirt for them. I don't think I put them in the hot seat, to be honest, but Lido Dow has definitely put them in the hot seat. So on October 25, Layer Zero announced that wrap stake Deep is now available as an oft on finance chain, scroll, avalanche, and ethereum. For those who need a refresher, oft stands for omnichan fungible token. It's sort of this crosschain token standard that allows tokens to be minted and burned through the layer zero bridge.
00:40:58.340 - 00:42:06.280, Speaker A: So obviously, wrapstake deep, just like a wrapped version of lido. Dow's stake deep. And basically what layer Zero has done here is expanded wrapstake deep access to all of these l two s and these side chains, right? And it enables these ecosystems to basically use Rapstake deep or stake deep in their defi ecosystems. It's gotten a lot of pushback so far because what layer Zero did was on the day itself, they posted a forum post in the Lido forums saying that they will give ownership of the rapsaked contract to the lido Dao upon support. And in their marketing material, mostly their tweets, they use statements such as, rapsake deep is now integrated with Layer Zero's oft standard. Or, for example, this will enable respective defi ecosystems to flourish while supporting Lido's desire for chain expansion. So if you were reading these tweets, you would maybe walk away thinking that this was like a big partnership between Layer Zero and Lido, that they've been working together for a long time and hashing out the security concerns.
00:42:06.280 - 00:42:52.040, Speaker A: Does Lido want to use layer Zero as a canonical bridge for rap safety? But that's not what has happened here. Layer Zero has sort of independently gone and basically announced that rapsaked would not be available on all of these l two s. And so I think most of the pushback is that there hasn't been a lot of time for the community to sort of discuss what bridge Rapsecd should use. For example, across. This co founder was absolutely livid in the forums and his tweets. He was ready to go on a podcast and just fight it out with Brian from Layer Zero. And basically, people are scared that the security of layer zero isn't enough for a token that's so important to defi.
00:42:52.040 - 00:43:14.272, Speaker A: It's probably like one of the largest market caps today. And Hasu especially. Right. Hasu is chief strategic head strategy for Lido, and his comments in the forum were very heated. He says he was speechless by what he's witnessing here. The parties involved burned a lot of goodwill. There were a lot of sketchy sales tactics involved.
00:43:14.272 - 00:44:01.876, Speaker A: And by unilaterally deploying a bridge and marketing it in an official seeming way, you're trying to pressure the Dow into accepting and avoiding liquidity fragmentation. So, yeah, just a lot of pushback as a whole. I think Lido wants to avoid a scenario where users think that layer Zero's wrapstick deep is the canonical version of rapsake on all of these chains. And probably another scenario that they're trying to avoid is liquidity fragmentation. The last thing you want is like, layer zero, rapsake deep, and then Lido rapsake deep and then across rapsake deep and then synapse rapsake deep. That's like a pretty horrible user experience that I'm sure we are all too familiar with, with ten different versions of USDCs on some random chain. So, yeah, a lot has happened since then.
00:44:01.876 - 00:44:28.860, Speaker A: In coordination with Scroll, Stargate, or layer zero has actually removed the bridging of rapstick deep into scroll, even though they were one of the early l two s that got announced. But my general takeaway here is that this may be a bit controversial. Layer zero didn't do anything wrong. It's a permissionless world and we're all living in it. Rapsaked deep is a token. Developers can integrate it however they may choose to. Sure.
00:44:28.860 - 00:45:08.148, Speaker A: Were some of their communications and marketing slightly misleading, could they have put out more disclaimers? Definitely. They could have said, this is not like the official rapsake thief, it's just our implementation of it. We haven't gotten Lido's official support of this, but I feel like that's kind of why we're here for crypto. Right? Like the whole permissionless innovation, people can build on top of each other however they want. And it feels like definitely there are probably some security concerns for rapsake deep. They're using Google Oracle. Sorry, Google Cloud as the Oracle, and they're using the default layer zero relayer as a relayer.
00:45:08.148 - 00:45:44.064, Speaker A: So I can kind of see some how you would be concerned considering that you don't want Google Cloud to be sort of like partaking the security of bridging of one of the largest tokens in DFI today. But also, I think it's a free market. If people want wrapstick deep on l two s and side chains, then someone will figure out a solution and someone will implement it. I get that Lido that wants to take it slowly and consider all of these security considerations for these different bridge vendors, but they really got to get to it. I'll stop there. That was a lot and I'd love to hear you guys thoughts.
00:45:44.192 - 00:46:23.212, Speaker C: Yeah, I think this is an interesting one because there's like two sets of actions. There's on chain actions and off chain actions by layer. Obviously, none of us were on the calls with Lido and layer zero about this. That sounds like, according to Hasu, these things appears to have happened based on his post about shady sales tactics. And I don't know what was said there behind those closed doors, but the off chain actions do seem a little out of line in a lot of different ways, just like from a business perspective. But to your point, ren, I don't disagree. I think their on chain actions are exactly what you could expect from a bridge.
00:46:23.212 - 00:47:09.244, Speaker C: They need to get their assets as widespread as possible, and that's kind of how they're going to do it. I would expect every bridge to race to do the exact same thing. To be honest, bridging is likely a race to zero in fees like most things are. But bridging especially, I do think it'll be heavily commoditized in honestly the near term. And because of that, you do need to be the widespread most adopted use case. And so going after very important assets seems like a no brainer to me. I liked that you mentioned the USDC thing, because anyone who's used arbitram, there's USDC native now and there's USDC e, and it is a little bit of a pain in the ass, but at the end of the, like, it's not a huge thing.
00:47:09.244 - 00:47:39.176, Speaker C: It's just kind of know how the cookie crumbles. And yes, I think everybody would agree that Ux is better with one version of the asset. But if you're Lido, you know, you have this really in demand asset. You got to get that thing. You have to race the bridges in a lot of different ways. And there's not this great silver bullet for bridging software, bridging solutions. And that kind of makes the problem worse because people are very concerned about the risks that are associated with bridges, and for good reason.
00:47:39.176 - 00:48:07.490, Speaker C: We've seen how many billions of dollars get exploited through bridges. So it's like, yeah, I think the off chain actions by layer zero are really what was problematic here, because we can't brag about DeFi Legos and then be upset when we see people build into that world. Right? So that's kind of where my head's at, is they really should have used better off chain communication from a person to person level, but their on chain actions of making it an oft, I just don't think that's bad.
00:48:07.860 - 00:48:49.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't get this from business perspective, because you're making so much bad will, or whatever you want to call it for yourself now you're messing with one of the biggest protocols in Defi. A lot of users see this as a bad thing as well, and it's clear that, as you said, there were some maybe or like shady actions made off chain. And this feels like more of a centralized decision and not like something made in a crypto ethos, if you can call that. Which is why I'm kind of against this whole thing. Or like, I didn't like how this whole thing played out.
00:48:50.400 - 00:49:08.644, Speaker D: I just feel like as lido, you can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't be like, oh, well, you guys want us to self limit? No. Market forces will decide. This is kind of the same thing, if you ask me. I mean, if the oft token that they create and launch doesn't have any demand, then boom, you're fine, doesn't matter, right? What am I missing here?
00:49:08.842 - 00:49:10.150, Speaker B: That's a good point.
00:49:10.760 - 00:49:39.148, Speaker C: Yeah. Again, I think that's true. But then you also can't be layer zero and make it sound like the official supported bridge. That's a little shady. And of course there's a good chance that that was just a social media person trying to do their job. There could be no malicious intent behind that. I don't know, but I think it just comes again, I would just keep saying this, but I think it was just their behavior behind closed doors and then marketing it as an official bridge.
00:49:39.148 - 00:49:42.050, Speaker C: I definitely disagree that that was an appropriate move.
00:49:42.580 - 00:50:27.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the way I look at it, if I was the bridge protocol founder, if I was layer zero, I am not waiting for someone to start a discussion on the Lido forums, go through a three month bridge assessment process for something that I can do permissionlessly. You bet my ass that I am going to do this and pray to God that there's demand for rapsake deep on all of these l two s and side chains and hopefully generate those network effects and just be the sort of de facto, I'm not going to say canonical, but de facto version of rapsake deep that people use on all of these l two s and side chains. Sure. Is it a bit against the crypto ethos?
00:50:28.320 - 00:50:46.196, Speaker C: Maybe, but I think no, there, right? Because you're building with DFI Legos, you're taking a great product that someone else built and then implementing it in your form and fashion. And that was kind of the first generation of use. Case was like, oh, composability, this is going to be awesome. You can build this great thing and then I can go put it somewhere else.
00:50:46.378 - 00:51:14.652, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think after the event happened, there's a lot of bridges that came out and then to announce this open bridge standard. Right. I think across Cedar lifi socket router. I love all of the teams, but they came out with this open bridge standard and coming out with this open brick standard. It feels like all of those LST protocols with 0.1% market share saying like, okay, for ethos sake, we're going to self limit to 22% or whatever.
00:51:14.652 - 00:51:34.240, Speaker A: When they're super, super teeny, it kind of just feels like you're just reacting to the fact that you didn't have the balls to deploy your version of rapsake deep on all of these l two s and side chains before layer zero did. So I'm pretty in support of layer zero here and what they did in terms of deploying this rapsake deep as an oft.
00:51:34.680 - 00:51:59.420, Speaker C: The only place I think your business plan falls apart is because now when, all right, there's rap staked eth on this l two liquidity incentives are kind of the name of game for bootstrapping. Lido is not throwing some tokens your way to help kind of bootstrap your tokens. Native liquidity now. And so then it's like, all right, maybe there's a use case for the Lzo token. Who knows?
00:51:59.760 - 00:52:18.636, Speaker A: Yeah, timing wise I think it's pretty good. I'm sure they didn't do this, but I'm sure there are people out there farming Stargate. Like using Stargate to farm for a potential layer zero token. And now that rapsake is the token available on Stargate, I think you'll see a decent amount of volume and usage.
00:52:18.828 - 00:52:22.230, Speaker C: Rick, you want to give us your hot seat cool throne this week?
00:52:22.920 - 00:53:17.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I wanted to give a shout out to all the people or all the capital that has been kind of sidelined for a while now. I guess there's a lot more coming maybe in the future. But last week we saw around $325,000,000 come into crypto, and that's the largest week since July 2022. After everything that's happened, I guess the market feels more fun again. I've never seen, or it's been a long time since I've seen crypto Twitter this euphoric. And it's kind of funny to see people bang heads against each other and now expectations are kind of diverging. Like the whole scene isn't or doesn't have the same opinion, which is, yeah, I think that creates a lot of opportunities.
00:53:17.700 - 00:54:06.864, Speaker B: But then again, the market has pretty much decoupled from the SP 500 again, which has been dropping for the last week. So I'm not sure how long this upside pressure can be maintained. And we're also getting earnings this week. And if some companies start underperforming, that could be maybe bad for the crypto scene. And then also we had that GDP coming in hot last week, which kind of implies that rates will be higher for longer, which again, isn't the best thing for crypto. But yeah, it's great to see. And I guess this all started with the fake BTC spot.
00:54:06.864 - 00:55:29.920, Speaker B: Rumors that started circulating around one day recently, and then the market reacted super positively. Everybody realized they was fake, then came down, but still a bit of a higher level than before the news. So I guess then people started kind of getting this fomo of, okay, we got to stay in the market now. This is like, everything's going to start happening soon, so let's start taking positions and yeah, can't wait for institutional capital to really flow into the scene and see what happens. Also, I guess that a lot of protocols right now are maybe getting closer to their intrinsic value, if you can call that, or like, there's been a lot of playing around with these meme tokens for the past two, three months, but now protocols with good tech and a lot of forward looking potential have started to become more noticed. And I think one of those tokens is Solana, or Sol, which around a month ago or month and a half ago was like one of the most popular shorts out there. But now the sentiment has flipped and everybody is super positive right now, and the token is up 60% in 30 days.
00:55:29.920 - 00:55:53.450, Speaker B: So we'll see what happens because this week is the largest Salana conference is going on. And historically, I guess the performance of the token hasn't been that great after the conference. So we'll see what happens there. But yeah, I haven't been this excited for a while.
00:55:53.900 - 00:56:36.912, Speaker A: Yeah, speaking of Salana, actually there were some interesting stats from that coin shares report about the amount of digital asset inflows. Salana actually saw more inflows than Ethereum over that week. Salana had $24 million of inflows and Ethereum had $6 million of inflows. So like a forex dividend? I think that's pretty crazy to see, to be honest. By a very wide margin, I would have thought that e products would have seen more info than Salana. So I don't know, maybe institutions are interested in salana more than ethereum these days. Perhaps after that van Eck report that came out, another interesting stat was the geographical distribution.
00:56:36.912 - 00:57:09.650, Speaker A: So Canada had 134,000,000 of infills, whereas the US only had $37.7 million of infills. And if I'm not wrong, Canada does have a few spot BTC products. And so I think if you could take away something from that, is that there is sort of a relatively higher amount of institutional demand for spot based bitcoin products than the futures based bitcoin products. And I think that bodes well for potential SeC approval sometime. Please.
00:57:11.460 - 00:57:47.924, Speaker C: Yeah. One of the interesting things about the Solana stuff is with breakpoint coming this week, I'm expecting a few tokens to have some projects, to have a few token related announcements. We've seen points programs going on from Jito and the liquid staking solution and marginfi, the lending platform. Presumably points programs eventually turn into tokens, and Breakpoint would be a very good time to do that. We just saw cipher launch its ido. Quite honestly, that didn't go very well. But that was a bit of a shaky protocol that had a recent exploit.
00:57:47.924 - 00:58:14.900, Speaker C: And so maybe not recent, but it had a history of an exploit. And so that can kind of shake user confidence. But there was only something like 400 or so users that participated in that iDo. And I don't know if it was geographically blocked at all, which I imagine it would exclude us investors or users. But I don't know. I think there's, like, this building momentum in the Solana community, and breakpoint is kind of a good point in time to have that release of the momentum.
00:58:15.640 - 00:58:43.900, Speaker B: Yeah, but maybe also worth pointing out that now some prominent investors are kind of flipping short on Solana because they're saying that right now the long trade is crowded and you still have galaxy holding FTX, like Solana position, which has to be liquidated at some point. And a lot of people are arguing that now is a great place to do it, following this super run up.
00:58:44.050 - 00:59:27.416, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's a good point. It does make me a little bit nervous. I have high hopes for the drift, the gdos, the margin fives, et cetera, but I haven't really looked into the numbers too deeply lately. But it still feels like there's just not a ton of people over there using that stuff. I mean, you're still only sitting at like three to 400 million of TVL, last I checked. And I don't know, just like, I get over there and I'm just kind of like, maybe I'm just stuck in my old ways, but I'm just kind of like, all right, what nft am I minting? You know what I mean? That's just kind of what I've always used Salana for, and I feel like there needs to be definitely some work done to get some of that Ethereum capital over to Solana to use DeFi because that is crypto's killer use case right now outside of stables. So I would like to see get get a little bit more traction on that front before I get too excited about the points programs.
00:59:27.528 - 00:59:55.430, Speaker C: And you know who's really well positioned to do that eclipse using Ethereum for settlement, sucking in some of that eth main net liquidity and then still having the SVM where you can presumably we'll see some clones of anything in DeFi on Solana port over. And now you can power marginfi with a more interesting collateral, right? I don't think Marginfi is this revolutionary protocol by any means. But now you do get to inject eth liquidity into your system.
00:59:55.960 - 01:00:00.372, Speaker D: Do you by any chance know when that goes live? That's actually a great call out.
01:00:00.506 - 01:00:27.900, Speaker C: Yeah, celestial mainnet is definitely a prereq because they're going to use them for DA. And obviously you need someone to post your DA to, so that has to go live first. I think we're going to see that before year end, though. So I would expect that before we flip to 2024. That was kind of my mental model for that. I think Nick White told us that last time he was on the pod. And so, yeah, once that goes live, I think we can get some of that traction and then we'll see a live eclipse.
01:00:30.800 - 01:00:34.610, Speaker D: You got anything else there, runner brick, or we ready to move on?
01:00:35.460 - 01:00:36.736, Speaker B: Let's do it.
01:00:36.918 - 01:01:21.056, Speaker D: Let's do it. All right. I feel like all I've talked about is DyDx now this podcast, but my cool throne is DyDX. The token is up about 30% over the past two weeks with the code base being open sourced, the bridge UI going live today, Monday, October 30, and validators actively being spun up and beginning to stake tokens. There's 76 validators that are set up according to mint scan, but only 60 will be included in the active set to begin with. So not sure how that term process actually works, but the important takeaway for investors is basically that all revenue will be shared with stakers, delegates, or delegators, I guess. And that'll be transaction fees paid in DYDX or USDC, or the trading fees that accrue in USDC as well.
01:01:21.056 - 01:01:58.964, Speaker D: So kind of a cool play to get USDC yield on a native chain asset. I'm expecting personally around 5% to 10% yields. I didn't realize for a little while that the standard over in the cosmos ecosystem is that locked tokens can be staked to earn, yield and participate in governance. So I definitely think that will dampen the yield paid out to stakers. And then as well, over the first six months, there's going to be maker rebates of 1.1 bips, as well as commission rates to validators running the nodes. So I'm expecting around 5% to 10%, not as good as I was honestly hoping.
01:01:58.964 - 01:02:31.536, Speaker D: When I was first running the numbers, I was thinking, man, this is going to be incredible. But now I'm not really quite as optimistic. It is worth noting that as the DyDX price keeps running the value of the 20 million DyDX tokens, or maybe it's fixed, $20 million. But regardless, the incentives kind of increase in value. So it kind of kicks off this little flywheel where more people will be incentivized to come over, keep trading, earning even higher value of fees, sorry, of incentives, and then paying more for fees. So it looks good for protocol fundamentals. DyDx is impressive.
01:02:31.536 - 01:02:59.212, Speaker D: I mean, it has a 60% market share, still above major perps. Dexes sees 500 million a day in volume consistently. No other perps Dex comes even close to that. Like, occasionally you'll see synthetics rip up to 300 mil in daily volume, or GMX or one of the others, but DyDX is consistently there. So I think there's something to be said about that. I am a little bit worried about users actually migrating over, because v three is going to stay live. And I think why broke isn't fixed is kind of how the saying goes.
01:02:59.212 - 01:03:06.240, Speaker D: So I could see a lot of people just hanging out there, keep trading there, but hopefully the incentives can migrate the volume over.
01:03:06.310 - 01:03:56.464, Speaker A: I was going to say, I agree that I think migration will be a slight concern, but that 20 million monthly incentives should sort of alleviate some of those concerns. I think one thing that I'm very keen to see how play out is sort of like mev on DYDX. The sort of mechanism today is that there's going to be like a social consensus mev slashing, if that's the best term. There's no sort of inbuilt mechanism. I think DyDX is working really heavily with skip protocol, and they're probably going to have a council to identify validators who are extracting envy. But it's weird, because a lot of professional traders will be on DYDX. Their market making chances are some of them will run their own validators, too.
01:03:56.464 - 01:04:39.936, Speaker A: And validators will have faster execution of their own trades because you can access the in memory order book yourself rather than accessing it through the indexer. And I feel like social consensus only works to a certain point, especially when you have so many different stakeholders and so much money at stake. Social consensus doesn't really work when there's a lot of money at stake. That's like my personal take, but yeah, that should be exciting to see. But I think it's okay. They can slowly scale that up. I know that after their alpha phase where they're just trying to get as much Dy DX staked and delegated, they're going to have a beta phase, which is just like a limited trading period where they can test things out.
01:04:39.936 - 01:04:45.280, Speaker A: So hopefully they can smooth those issues out before it goes for a full launch.
01:04:45.700 - 01:04:57.110, Speaker D: Just to clarify one thing real quick there, too. The $20 million is fixed in dollar terms and it's over like four to six months, not monthly. If it was monthly, I would be insanely bullish right now, but brick, go ahead.
01:04:57.560 - 01:05:25.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to ask, do you think that it's easier now for DYDX if they're able to migrate a lot of people over to the cosmos ecosystem to get them to stay order? Do you feel that they're going to be stickier since they're kind of in a new ecosystem? And do you feel that maybe these incentives could be successful? Because I guess we've seen a lot of incentive programs run out and then traders just leave the platform.
01:05:26.560 - 01:06:01.828, Speaker D: My personal take on this, and David would hate to hear me say this, but I don't think it's going to be that sticky. You've only got two assets on the platform, DYDX, the token itself, which has a one way bridge. So, yeah, I don't expect that to go anywhere other than DYDX chain for the most part, other than maybe some osmosis pools or something like that. And then I also see just USDC through circle, CCTP. So CCIP. God, there's so many acronyms. But nonetheless, I don't think that people are going to be going to DyDX and be Cosmos pilled.
01:06:01.828 - 01:06:19.776, Speaker D: And going over all these other applications, I think it's pretty much going to be a venue to trade, and it's like a standalone product. That's how Antonio has been positioning it and marketing it as if it's not a Cosmos chain, it's just a product that's really good, that people can use, that's decentralized. That's community owned. So yeah, that's just my two cent on it.
01:06:19.878 - 01:07:06.750, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with your justification for that take there, Sam. My understanding is when you're on the DyDX front end, it's not going to feel too much like a crypto app where you are like, oh, this is fun. What else can I do on this subset of chains or applications? Maybe if you're trading some degen thing on arbitram, it very much gives you that feel, and that's probably a good thing for a general purpose chain too. But I don't think it's going to feel like, oh, let me go take this USDC that I have as collateral, bridge it over to Kujira or Osmosis or Kanto for however long it remains a Cosmos chain. I just don't think that that's going to be the feeling that you get when you use the app.
01:07:07.200 - 01:07:54.536, Speaker D: I should mention too, just real fast, the large unlocks, there's going to be like 60% month over month inflation from November to December with that. So that's just another brutal headwind. I don't know. I want to say, and I don't think this is public information or anyone actually knows, but I would bet a large percentage of these tokens belong to Antonio himself, considering how small of a team it was in the beginning, it was literally just him, and now it's like a pretty big team. But I would guess a vast majority of those tokens belong to himself. And just listening to interviews with him, it does not sound like he has any interest in working on any project or going out of crypto like he wants to build DyDX for the foreseeable future. So I could definitely see a lot of those tokens being staked immediately, not sold, and then just occasionally dipping into the piggy bank and selling when he really needs to.
01:07:54.536 - 01:08:03.344, Speaker D: But I don't think it's going to be some giant game over for DyDxcel event, and I'm sure a lot of investors are hedged accordingly already too.
01:08:03.542 - 01:08:12.270, Speaker C: Of course, not financial advice, but that's probably a great way to wrap up the episode as well. So appreciate you guys for joining Ren and Brick, and we'll talk to you all next week.
