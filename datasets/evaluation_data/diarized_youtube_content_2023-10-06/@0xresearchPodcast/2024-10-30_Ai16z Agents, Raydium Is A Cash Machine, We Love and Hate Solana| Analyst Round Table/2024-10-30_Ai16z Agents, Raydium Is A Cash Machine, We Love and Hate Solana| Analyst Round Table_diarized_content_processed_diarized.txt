00:00:00.240 - 00:00:35.095, Speaker A: This is cash flow, operating cash flow for the business. Right. So if you really want to value it on cash flow, the average S&P 500 company is probably like 30 something. And, you know, Radium now is probably like around 10 because it's the same thing as earnings. Cash flow earnings is the same thing. So, I mean, it's doubled in price, but it's, you know, it's still attractive, it's still the number one dex, and it's not reliant on meme coins for volume that, you know, people are seeing the kind of revenues and earnings that Radium are making and they want to tap into some of that. So there, there is competition creeping up right now, but for now, it's the market.

This podcast is for informational purposes only and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our opinions, not financial advice. Boccaccio Ryan and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects discussed. What's up, guys? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Today I'm joined by Mark and Ryan from the Blockworks research team. How are you guys doing?
00:01:05.325 - 00:01:10.985, Speaker A: All great. Bitcoin hitting above 72, so couldn't be happier right now.
00:01:11.685 - 00:01:21.425, Speaker B: Hopefully when the pod goes live, it will be at 74, 75K. What about you, Ryan? You've been bearish this whole way up?
00:01:23.455 - 00:01:32.995, Speaker C: I haven't been bearish this whole way up. I am always short term bearish and long term bullish, so absolutely very good.
00:01:34.695 - 00:02:16.385, Speaker B: So apart from bitcoin doing very, very well, we have a few interesting things that have happened over the past week, week and a half. I think the big one is, well, like for the past two weeks there have been AI tokens. So there's the interesting ones which I. The ones that I find more interesting, which are like dao AI tokens, which I'm going to get into, but there's also regular AI tokens such as goat, which is based off Goatse, which is something that I can't talk about on the podcast, but if you're interested in the lore, you can just search it up. Goatse and everything else just seems to have died out, but Goat got listed and it's done quite well. Mark, do you want to say something?
00:02:17.005 - 00:02:21.145, Speaker A: I was just going to say you could not search it up as well. You don't have to.
00:02:21.845 - 00:02:24.025, Speaker B: Yeah, potentially don't search it up.
00:02:24.325 - 00:02:31.237, Speaker C: Every pod that I've listened to warns the viewers not to search it and you're going the precise opposite direction.
00:02:31.421 - 00:03:10.041, Speaker B: Well, I think people should find out what they're buying and why they're buying it if they're really interested in the token GOT list got listed on a bunch of exchanges. I think it's like 700 more. Either way, that's not interesting. What I've been finding more and more interesting is the AI 16Z fund, which was launched on. Wait up. I have this all on my little presentation, which I'm going to put up on the screen right now. AI16Z is the first AI VC fund fully managed by Mark AI Drayson Andreyson with recommendations from members of the DAO.
00:03:10.041 - 00:03:56.839, Speaker B: So this is, this was created through Daos Fun. This is not financial advice, by the way. Don't buy this. You can if you want to, but the gist is that it was an AI character created on Twitter and supposedly likely not, but manages this fund and what it invests in. I, maybe I, I'll stop there and I'll let you guys tell me about what you think about this thing because I've been like, there's a few takes on this. One is the very cynical short term, bearish take that's, oh, I don't really like find these, like, these are clearly fake and I don't really find them very interesting. And then there's the optimistic long term bullish take, which is this is like a new paradigm where we're actually seeing AI interplay with crypto.
00:03:56.839 - 00:04:04.425, Speaker B: It wasn't a joke the whole time. AI is actually like interested in this stuff or AI has to and be interested in this stuff. What do we think?
00:04:04.585 - 00:04:49.591, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I can start by saying that I was totally incorrect about AI agents in crypto. I thought that it was like a plus 12 months thing. I was very wrong, but wrong with my timing on a lot of AI stuff. Just as far as like thinking about when products will launch and like, you know, the cadence of product innovation. But like, they're clearly here to some degree. We can call it like semi autonomous and I think it's really interesting and I think that, you know, I think we're on a precipice of like a new, new stage in the meme coin cycle where, I mean, look, if you go back to like last October, like meme coins were hard to launch. Then like deck screener grew in prominence.
00:04:49.591 - 00:05:46.665, Speaker C: You know, Gecko terminal grew in prominence. And then you got curation and discovery. That pump function Fun launched and it became, you know, it lowered the barriers to, you know, launching new Coins and now you're seeing these kind of like AI meme coin daos emerge where you're turning these meme coins from like static memes to like these dynamic interactive games where you know, imagine if Doge was dynamic interactive when you know, Elon started pumping it and like the Doge account could like respond back in some like unique and novel way. Like I think, I think it really takes the potential for virality to another level and it makes the game more fun. So you know, I think we've entered a new era in the meme, in the meme coin thing and it's, and it's driven by AI and I don't think anyone predicted that, which is pretty cool.
00:05:47.365 - 00:06:12.155, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely agreed. I mean I thought AI was going to come for maybe some of the other jobs first. What looks like traders is first on its list. I mean more power to it. But I think I like the daos. I like the daos concept. You know, you, you're tokenizing semi investment fund and basically the entire prospectus is codified, right.
00:06:12.155 - 00:07:11.769, Speaker A: And so you can like, you know, it's, it has one year and then the token, the net asset value, the funds of the DAO automatically return to investors and you know, if it has one week to do fundraising and all of this is just codified, there's no lawyers involved so it's really lowers the barrier to entry, which we love and I guess AI loves as well. And you know, I'm, you know you're combining a high memes crypto so the potential for virality is really there and I'm looking to the next stage of this where these like daos start to invest in the other daos, the other tokenized daos. So it's daos of daos, like funds of funds. Right. So I mean it's only a matter of time. Right. But I think it's an interesting concept and you know, I like that it's here now for the memes but it is really something that could be used outside of that as well, just like short term funds.
00:07:11.769 - 00:07:23.511, Speaker A: And hopefully maybe this kind of attention leads to something a little bit more trad 5 productive like in the future, you know, so short term bullish, long term bullish.
00:07:23.703 - 00:07:57.821, Speaker B: That's fair. I actually Mark, I'm glad you brought up dials because I feel like I didn't do that enough justice. So like you mentioned, they have one week to fundraise in Seoul and once the fundraise is over, the Dow can invest those tokens and then it has a What? It has one year to return the fund back to. It doesn't have to return the fund, but it has to return the funds to investors, like you said. I think this is pretty cool as well. We've had a few attempts of this. I don't know if you guys know sdfx.
00:07:57.821 - 00:08:13.381, Speaker B: It's actually like Murad's, you know, must stop. Murad has old protocol. It was kind of like, but it wasn't a year. It was like per trade. So you could invest in somebody's trade. I could say, I'm gonna go long, Solana right now. And Mark, you could chuck money at me.
00:08:13.381 - 00:08:53.766, Speaker B: Ryan, you could chuck money at me. And then that's like my vault that I manage. This is like you said, a new thing where it's like, I'm not sure how useful it will be. I typically find in crypto that people have quite high sophistication or like, they think they have high sophistication, so they want to manage their own money. Like, why invest in a DAO when you could, like, you think you have the right calls. You don't think like some random DAO has it, which I think is like, has been the case for these vault style products or fun style products. On the other hand, like you said, it's easy to rally around the DAO and like, if AI can do it.
00:08:53.766 - 00:09:03.885, Speaker B: I also think that's pretty cool to give like AI access to funds. You know, it's gonna lose it likely, but it's at least a valid attempt at trying out something new.
00:09:04.345 - 00:09:31.965, Speaker A: At least you're losing it in a fun way. But I kind of hoped, and maybe there's a next iteration where they shorten the lock, the lock up period from like, I mean, one year in crypto. Like, who knows what's going to happen? You know, if they could have maybe different tiers with like three months, one month, I think that would be interesting as well. I mean, we're going more and more down the Degen curve, but I mean, it's permissionless finance. That's why we're here. Right? So I'd like to see that person.
00:09:32.855 - 00:10:27.995, Speaker B: Yeah, completely agree. And Ryan, on your point of like expecting AI agents to do well later on, I completely agree. I think in my head, when I wrote, because I wrote about Parallel Colony and Wayfinder a while back, maybe like four months back, and in my head I felt like, this will be ready second half of 2025, realistically. But increasingly I think, and this is one of my favorite things about meme coins, like Apart from the financial nihilism stuff that a lot of people like to parrot, I do think that financial incentives and that like risk taking really makes people work hard for their bags and work hard to like find a new like devs need to work hard to make money. Again, it's not like you can't just launch a third, fourth restaking protocol or an L2 like it. We saw this with Pump Fun and with friend tech and there's something Berg you also mentioned on the pod. It's like there's money out there for you as a dev to make money.
00:10:27.995 - 00:11:16.425, Speaker B: There's enough money out there if you can build something cool related to Meme Coins for you like as a dev to make money. And I think these kinds of products are kind of the result. Like Pump Fun would it did well. So people see that it did well and they want to launch the new X Pump Fund which is Dallas fun maybe, maybe not. But like we're constantly getting this reiteration and I think that's going to. I'm not sure if we can call these things AI agents, but I do think that the AI agent to Meme Coin Interlink has led to more and more financial innovation to the point that like whatever we're thinking right now, Wayfinder, maybe not in six months, but in two months for Meme Coins just because the team realizes that there's a lot of money out there that wants to use this thing and they just launched it.
00:11:17.165 - 00:11:50.705, Speaker C: Yeah, Pump Fund was, was very important in the signaling for potential of, for potential profits for new devs to enter the space. For sure. It's a great example. 150 million in what, less than 12 months. It's, you know, it's fantastic. And you know we have. What does the Electric Capital Report say? We have like 26,000 builders, numbers like that get out and they peak interest and it helps that these things are permissionless and it's easier spending new things up.
00:11:50.705 - 00:11:52.685, Speaker C: Yeah, it's going to be exciting.
00:11:54.025 - 00:11:56.417, Speaker B: Any other AI agent takes or should we move on?
00:11:56.561 - 00:12:50.615, Speaker C: I think that there's the potential like with the, with these decentralized GPU networks or distributed compute networks that we have in crypto, we wrote a report on them about seven or eight months ago. And what we did was instead of like focusing on like the cost advantage that we had, we've theorized about some like some natural first customers. And you know, one obvious one is just startups who don't have existing cloud relationships that are cost sensitive. The other, the number two, like highest potential first Customer was like the crypto natives. And so far we really haven't had a reason for crypto native firms to use these decentralized GPU networks. I think you start to see people test these things out. Now if you're running a.
00:12:50.615 - 00:13:50.895, Speaker C: If you're running a Twitter AI agent that interacts with some AI dao, you might want to, as a fun experiment or to create confidence in the market, prove that your inference is happening on some decentralized network. Right. There's been questions about how decentralized these things actually are. I think there's been some challenges around or some rumors about these daos frontrunning some of the investments that they've made or some of the ones that were suggested by the community. So to kind of like prove that decentralized interest, I think you might see like a short term bump in revenue for these things as devs experiment with decentralized inference in the context of these AI DAOs and these Twitter AI agents. So the obvious names there are IO Render, Akash Cusco there. You know, there's a handful of projects.
00:13:50.935 - 00:14:22.459, Speaker B: There that makes sense. One thing I've been thinking about is stuff like virtuals that or really any other like AI agent protocol that lets you launch AI agents for characters. So I, I mentioned this today on call as well. I think there's going to be a market for. It's kind of a sad thing to talk about, but I'm going to talk about there's going to be a market for like less regulated AI chat bots and AI bots. And that's. I think that's a pretty natural fit for crypto.
00:14:22.459 - 00:14:55.799, Speaker B: Even though I don't like it when these things are natural fit. But like permissionless finance, but it's also like permissionless, you can do whatever the hell you want kind of if it's decentralized or at least that's what we've convinced ourselves. So I can see that being a thing. I also think in general AI agents aren't going to be what we tout them to be, which is they're just going to be using crypto money all along. I think that's kind of cope. I do like the meme coin AI agent thing, but I think it'll be a fad. I'm kind of excited for AI agents to do stuff for me on Chain.
00:14:55.799 - 00:15:30.237, Speaker B: I would love one that can just like auto compound for me. Stuff that I have to manually compound into, like if I'm farming something, because I hate doing those interactions and I would much rather for agents to do that. And I think that's probably a bit niche, just like crypto, very crypto focused. But I could see that being the thing up with GPU marketplace sense of I have no hot takes. I think you're right. I think those are going to probably struggle to find a demand for some time still. I just, I don't like, like I was wrong as well.
00:15:30.237 - 00:15:46.957, Speaker B: I thought tau was going to be the AI meme coin, like the BTC of AI. It's. It's always better to just go if you're gonna go left curve to go as left curve as possible. Like buy the AI meme or whatever, don't buy the narrative leader or whatever.
00:15:46.981 - 00:15:48.105, Speaker A: You want to call it.
00:15:48.965 - 00:16:46.545, Speaker C: It's certainly the meta this cycle. I want to go back though to where you said of like launching these agents with different personalities. I should think that there's like, there's a big barrier to entry there. If you look at this goat meme, it was fine tuned by a professional on very esoteric data sets. And the reason that it's viral is because it has very interesting, colorful replies that are not off the shelf from Claude and the ChatGPT3 or ChatGPT3 and 4 APIs. Right? This is like a very niche data set that was used to fine tune this thing. So like what I'm excited about like on the venture side is like click to launch AI agents with these very niche personalities and to do it right, you actually have to curate some really interesting data sets.
00:16:46.545 - 00:17:20.334, Speaker C: It's much harder than a pump function. There's a big barrier to entry there. Especially if you're going to have like some system scrape the relevant data for you to then fine tune that agent. Right? Like you need some real AI chops to build a system like that. So the barrier to entry is going to be a little bit higher. The friction to launching these AI agents with these unique personalities is going to be challenging. But I think, I mean, I take the other side.
00:17:20.334 - 00:17:55.375, Speaker C: I think that this AI agent meme coin thing is not a. I think, I think it's likely, more likely than not, that it's here to stay. I don't think it's going to be a fad at all. It's. In the history of the Internet, we went from text to image to video. Content has gotten more and more immersive and the trend there for content, the effect of that trend becoming more immersive is that the interactions and like time spent in these systems by consumers, by retail is longer and stronger. Right.
00:17:55.375 - 00:18:12.065, Speaker C: The penetration is deeper. So now that memes are becoming much more interactive, I think the same trend is going to. I think it's going to exhibit the same trend, that these things are going to be much stickier than the prior generation of. Of meme coins.
00:18:12.525 - 00:18:28.165, Speaker A: But, yeah, but on that note, we've gone from text to image to video, and then now to kind of value and kind of what Buck was saying earlier. Like, don't we assume that these AI agents or whatever, however you want to describe them, are going to use blockchain rails?
00:18:28.205 - 00:18:28.405, Speaker C: It's.
00:18:28.445 - 00:18:31.877, Speaker A: I mean, it's like the least barrier to entry for them. It's.
00:18:31.981 - 00:18:32.309, Speaker B: There's.
00:18:32.357 - 00:19:11.795, Speaker A: There's no API or paywalls needed, and it's less fees. I mean, we're even seeing like, you know, fintech behemoths like Stripe, you know, with that, with their recent acquisition, their $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge, which is the, I think, the largest crypto acquisition ever. Like, we're seeing these companies lean heavily into, you know, using crypto and specifically stable coins as payment rails. And we just. I feel like, you know, that's going to be the evolution for maybe larger processing, like remittances and stuff, but then also for AI agents. But I don't know if you, if you disagree with that, but I just see that as the next evolution.
00:19:12.175 - 00:19:47.945, Speaker B: I think that's a good point. I think my gut reaction has always been like, institutions aren't going to let us take that. I just feel like AI agents, if we think it's going to be as big as, like, whatever we think it is, then it would make no sense for non crypto rails to give that up. You know what I mean? Because you're talking about potentially millions and millions and millions of dollars in fees for basically something that you don't have to provide any customer service to. Like, this thing is just going to transact and transact. There's no. It's not like a human.
00:19:47.945 - 00:19:57.153, Speaker B: Where you have to deal with it. It's just a bot that is giving you free money constantly. I. I wouldn't give it up. I don't know if. And I get what you mean, though. It makes sense.
00:19:57.153 - 00:20:06.555, Speaker B: Like, crypto is the easiest way to enter this. I just think they'll make it easy enough that they'll capture a percent of it instead of giving it up.
00:20:07.135 - 00:20:35.965, Speaker C: Yeah, I think where we're getting at here is like this common argument that, like, oh, like, AI agents need crypto rails. Like, I don't buy that at all. Stripe works fine. There's huge network network effects there. All the money is over there. Right. If you're going to make an AI agent for some non web3 use case, like you're going to plug it into Stripe and let people like, you know, let it do things on Shopify with dollars, there's no reason that it needs to be on crypto Rails.
00:20:36.545 - 00:20:47.169, Speaker A: So that's kind of, that's kind of my, that's kind of my point in saying like you will just use a Stripe. You will use whichever intermediate platform that makes the PSP service seamless.
00:20:47.217 - 00:20:47.377, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:47.401 - 00:21:17.175, Speaker A: And then if Stripe just happens to use financial Rails like a Solana in the back end just because it's maybe, you know, faster settlement times and quicker and cheaper, then they will use that. And you're deploying your agents via what you think is web2 and you have no idea that the Rails in the back are, you know, stable coins. And so that's kind of where I was getting at. Not that necessarily. We who are used to using this stuff directly on chain will be the prime marketplace for these things.
00:21:17.795 - 00:21:21.375, Speaker C: Yeah. When do you think that that happens? I think that that's so far away.
00:21:22.395 - 00:21:30.467, Speaker B: Ryan. You can't keep saying I think that's so far away and then come back in three months and be like, oh, actually I was wrong guys. It was not that far away.
00:21:30.651 - 00:22:24.099, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. It's. There's not a lot of evidence of like institutional adoption of stable coins picking up in that way. Maybe with some regular may like all crypto often like references like network effects as a reason why something is sticky or why it's hard to compete with something or why crypto will grow. And like why do crypto folks always forget about like the network effects of like the traditional financial system? Like it's really, it's a pain in the ass to move like your custodian. It's a pain in the ass to implement some like new software when the, like the take from something like the, you know, the, the costs associated with the traditional financial system, like they're not like an insurmountable cost for tradfi institutions. Like it's working fine.
00:22:24.267 - 00:23:20.883, Speaker A: No, I, I agree with that. But I think maybe, maybe sooner than you think and you did mention maybe with regulations and then we had MICA pass this year and summer in, in Europe and you know, institutions don't need to adjust until I think, I think December 31st is the deadline. So we can, we have stablecoin regulations there and then you know, we have some drafts in the US of various stablecoin bills which, if any regulation is going to pass, that's going to be the first one and I'm again predicting next year for that. So. And in fact, that stripe, which is, you know, 20% growth per year and, you know, it makes costs cheaper on the, on the B2B side. I think the fact that they're putting such a large bet in, into this backend infrastructure and the fact that their fees are a little bit lower and it's kind of like it's just, it's setting up the, setting up the play field.
00:23:21.059 - 00:23:56.581, Speaker B: I think that's fair. I want to touch back on something you mentioned, Ryan, which was about training these models on data sets. It's not a great segue, but GRASS launched yesterday and their whole thing is data sets. They scrape the Internet by using our residential proxies, our unused bandwidth. I had dredge on the podcast a few months back. If my listeners don't know what GRASS does, you guys can check that out. But Ryan, I want to talk you, talk with you through this.
00:23:56.581 - 00:24:29.835, Speaker B: In my mind, I think this captures something that we haven't seen in crypto X AI yet. Like we haven't seen a lot of data focused protocols. I think this is the only one, really. And I hear sometimes that people say we're running out of good data and we don't have a lot of data. And the data that we do have is typically owned by centralized parties who don't want to give it out. And I mean, this is pretty clear now. If anybody wants to use the Twitter API, it's thousands of dollars.
00:24:29.835 - 00:24:39.697, Speaker B: Ryan, do you think there's actually, I guess, value in this? And like, how do you would you approach this as a, like, thinking for.
00:24:39.721 - 00:24:43.897, Speaker C: This, the GRASS example specifically, it doesn't.
00:24:44.001 - 00:24:46.201, Speaker B: It doesn't have to be grass. I don't want to talk too much.
00:24:46.233 - 00:24:48.805, Speaker C: About like Data dash.
00:24:49.465 - 00:25:19.315, Speaker B: Yeah, both, both are good, I think. I don't like data dowels. The only exact, like the only experiences that I've had have been bad. So maybe that's why I don't want to talk about data dials. But I'm happy to talk about both of them and how you see the market shaping up. Because to me it's very, I think it's, I think it'll be lucrative just based on like, what I've seen and I like the way that GRASS is approaching it. I typically think data that like DAO structures are inefficient unless it's run by people who really know their shit.
00:25:19.315 - 00:25:29.181, Speaker B: I think in general like anytime you try to do some form of daoization around the product, it just goes to shit. There's never anything getting done. But what do you think?
00:25:29.333 - 00:26:18.115, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that there are two flavors of data projects potentially in crypto very broadly. One of them is like very much being built today. The other is like tbd but I think has higher potential. The first flavor is just like data daos, like incentivizing the creation and maintenance of some new and ex, some new and unique data set. So I think that grass fits that mold. I think that these wearables in crypto that are hitting the market fit that mold. There are some like asset management based ones that like will scrape your data and use it to like trade in financial markets if it's E commerce data.
00:26:18.115 - 00:27:15.213, Speaker C: Those all fit that mold and I think that they're definitely useful especially in the health care space in the United States. Electronic healthcare records are like actually very rare in this country. Few countries have very good data sets like Israel being one of them. So you're, you have this very obvious moment in AI where you know, we're, we're solving major problems just having these models churn and churn and churn and figure out the problems on their own essentially. But we don't have great health like data in healthcare to do that. I think that some incentivized like crypto thing to have people contribute their data to a dao via some wearable or you know, or, or another means is like probably a useful thing. And like, and again grass fits in that category where they're getting a unique data set that's free of data poisoning to ensure like the proper training of these models.
00:27:15.213 - 00:27:57.253, Speaker C: Like yeah, makes a lot of sense. On the other side there's another flavor which is synthetic data. I don't think that there's much incremental data like the data that we've used to train these AI models. Just from a rounding perspective, we've used it all. So what's next is synthetic data. And I think these compute depends are uniquely positioned to generate synthetic data because they amass a lot of consumer hardware that's cheaper to run and it's not a latency sensitive business. So when you have a latency sensitive business like you know, the consumer has to click the button, they have to get the answer.
00:27:57.253 - 00:28:31.949, Speaker C: It's not really true with the compute or sorry with, with synthetic data generation. You just need to pump it out via inference. So I think that you know, the compute deep ins are pretty well positioned to Generate that type of data into some DAO structure to then like sell to like an ll, like a foundation or frontier model lll company. There's. And the prices that they can charge are massive. Right. Like, if you know what a hedge fund pays for like unique data sets, you know, they'll pay the tens of millions of dollars.
00:28:31.949 - 00:28:38.967, Speaker C: Like these things can be really profitable if they do their BD right and they build the, and they build the right product.
00:28:39.111 - 00:28:45.871, Speaker B: Hey guys, welcome back to another million snippet. Today I'm joined by Miguel. Thanks for joining us, Miguel.
00:28:46.063 - 00:28:48.075, Speaker D: Thank you, Bokato. It's great to be here.
00:28:50.135 - 00:28:52.395, Speaker B: What is personalized AI?
00:28:54.095 - 00:29:55.401, Speaker D: Well, it's, it's a key evolutionary step in AI and it is when AI gets you, you know, gets to know you better, when AI actually knows everything about you and everything that makes you you. And it's a necessary step in order for AI to be really useful. If you think in terms of a servant, a good servant has to know all the dark secrets about their master. So in order for AI to become this truly useful tool that you can you find helpful and knows everything about you and really understands your way of thinking and your needs and everything, it has to know all your dark secrets. It has to know all about you. And that's what we call personalized AI. And most LLM networks are nowadays not personalized AI because they're trained on public data mostly, but the trend is to get towards that.
00:29:55.401 - 00:30:19.357, Speaker D: So we've seen that with OpenAI getting now access and getting a sort of memory and others following that same path. So companies are aware of that, that's an evolutionary necessary step and are developing their technologies so that they manipulate more and more information about you so that they can contextualize their responses and make them more useful.
00:30:19.461 - 00:30:25.105, Speaker B: Perfect. And how is private compute and storage important for personalized AI?
00:30:26.295 - 00:31:30.513, Speaker D: Yeah, so the good thing about this personalized AI is that, as I said, it's going to make AI more useful for us. But there's a concern because if Web2 was a race for your attention, now with personalized AI, it's turning into a race for intimacy. Companies do want to know you very well from the inside out. They want to learn everything about you, even things you wouldn't like to share. So the level three information that we were talking about last time, all that information is really sensitive about you and gives a lot of power to the companies having access to it. So we believe that no company should ever wield so much power over you, not only because they could share that data behind your back, but also because they could use it in ways that are inconceivable right now to manipulate you in, you know, in an undetectable way or fashion. Because they do know also your blind spots.
00:31:30.513 - 00:32:24.885, Speaker D: They do know your weaknesses. So they could exploit those. And even if you think about in terms of IP or intellectual property, they could extract, they could mine your ideas and thoughts and creative processes just through your daily conversations with the AI. So why would a company hire you when it has this little clone of you that, you know, is in constant contact with you, kind of extracting all that valuable information? And companies can actually use that for their benefit. So there's a lot of wicked ways in which you can think about turning these Level 3 data into things that are not necessarily good for you, but are very good for the company. This creates very dangerous incentives. So this calls for bringing in privacy into the equation.
00:32:24.885 - 00:32:38.185, Speaker D: We can't be sharing our prompts with all that high value data with future personalized AIs. We can't be giving AI companies our level 3 data. We need private compute and storage essentially to protect us from all those risks.
00:32:39.885 - 00:32:45.195, Speaker B: That makes sense. And how is Nillian approaching personalized AI specifically?
00:32:46.215 - 00:33:40.565, Speaker D: Yeah, so to begin with, we are supporting a lot of data to earn products. Those are products that are actually offering you the possibility to store your personal data in a safe way while retaining full control over it in our network. So if you think about that in comparison to what Web2 offers, Web2 offers you a private way of storing information, but it's not fully private because the company has access to that information. Because eventually you will want to run processes and will want to action that information, and that will require the company to actually decrypt it. So that means they have the means to access that information. Here we're talking about something different. So what nealion provides is a storage layer whereby nodes never get access to your data.
00:33:40.565 - 00:34:21.895, Speaker D: They don't have a magic key that enables them to decrypt it. Your data remains truly under your own and sole control. So you're the only one who's able to kind of remove the encryption layer and have access to that information. So that's a very different type of privacy. We call it decentralized privacy compared to the centralized version in Web two. So that's step one, bring all the personal data into our platform. Step two is to innovate on all the bottlenecks that privacy enhancing technologies encounter when they try to run all the AI models.
00:34:21.895 - 00:35:08.633, Speaker D: And essentially they revolve around the evaluation of nonlinear functions. That is what you typically found in activation functions and in their normalization layers. And there we have pioneered the effort of bringing a technology from image processing which is called the discrete wave transform. For example, it is used in the JPEG 2000 standard to compress images. It has that ability to compress things. We've taken that technology and implemented it on top of cryptographic protocols to compress the lookup tables that are typically used to evaluate those nonlinear functions that you find in a, in a, in an AI model. And so we have successfully accelerated the evaluation of models significantly.
00:35:08.633 - 00:36:20.463, Speaker D: So that's number two and number three is to embrace what's coming, which is agents, as a first step towards personalized AI. Agents are a significant step because they take LLMs away from this high frequency interaction mode to something that is slightly lower frequency but with more intelligence in it. Because instead of giving you the response it actually thinks or kind of runs other prompts on that response to enhance its value and make it more useful to you. But in doing so, it kind of takes more time to the LLM to respond to you. That's very important because it puts privacy enhancing technologies in a less demanding position in terms of performance. But at the same time it is the path towards personalized AI, because that path will provide more and more independence to the AI, more and more intelligence. The AI will have more, will spend more time thinking on itself about the problems that you put in front in front of it.
00:36:20.463 - 00:36:35.715, Speaker D: So to us, embracing agents and you know, incorporating them into our network is a very important way or to get ready for what's coming next, which is the end goal, which is personalized AI.
00:36:36.895 - 00:36:38.795, Speaker B: Perfect. Thank you so much, Miguel.
00:36:39.255 - 00:36:40.635, Speaker D: You're welcome, Boccaccio.
00:36:41.895 - 00:36:51.945, Speaker B: For what it's worth, I am extremely excited about AI agents because I hate doing scheduling stuff and email stuff. So I just, I just want one.
00:36:51.985 - 00:36:56.005, Speaker D: Yes, yes. Yeah, me too. That's really exciting subject.
00:36:56.425 - 00:37:04.725, Speaker B: How far do you think we are from work? Like not like semi working, but like working actually AI agents?
00:37:05.425 - 00:37:48.835, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. There's like these four agentic flows in LLMs. You have the reflection one that is working pretty well, which is when you produce something, you analyze it from different perspectives. But that's not really like helping you, I think in the way that you mean. Then you have like tooling, which is, oh, we're going to use tools to send emails, we're going to use tools to, I don't know, manipulate images and videos and so on. I think that one is pretty advanced And I don't think there's, we should be seeing like innovations in that front. In short, I would, I would imagine.
00:37:48.835 - 00:38:35.875, Speaker D: And then you have planning, which is not working that well, is more experimental, which is before solving a task you kind of plan for it and then you follow the steps by creating different prompts. And then the multi, multi agent stuff, which is where you have different agents with different roles. Like for example, it's a company, you have a marketing LLM and a sales LLM and a engineering LLM, whatever product LLM and so on. And you throw a problem at them and they discuss between them and they come up with a solution that's also kind of experimental. I think the tooling one and the reflection one are the shortest that we will see happening anytime soon, but are also kind of the most helpful, I think in the short term.
00:38:36.355 - 00:38:45.915, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope that the consumer facing one relatively soon, the multi agent one, sounds really, really cool. Yeah, I can imagine it will take much longer, but it sounds very cool.
00:38:45.995 - 00:39:02.655, Speaker D: Yeah, it sounds cool, right? Like having all the power of a startup, like throw a problem at it and then you have something like a product, maybe it codes, but it also kind of figures out the mark, the go to market and the business model around it. I think it's really interesting.
00:39:02.735 - 00:39:07.591, Speaker B: All right, what's up guys? We're back. Ryan, do you want to give you a weekly Solana rant?
00:39:07.743 - 00:40:09.615, Speaker C: Sure. Full disclosure, I don't want to give a weekly Solana rant. It just so happens to be that that's the ecosystem that's gaining the mindshare, producing the results, launching the interesting things, like not my fault, I did not want to talk about Solana Rev, but we have to because it hit all time highs. Do you have a chart for that? So yes, Alana, real economic value, which you can think of as a measure of like revenue, something analogous to tradfi revenue. Real economic value on a weekly basis hit 60, about 60 million up from like a low of like 5 in September, the lowest week in September. The composition of Rev is priority fees, base fees and tips for mev. And yeah, Solana MEV is at all time highs and it's surpassing like the giant in the space Ethereum.
00:40:09.615 - 00:40:58.895, Speaker C: Why does that matter? Like look, the whole space is kind of in this like constant argument about whether or not cash flows matter. And people say like they do matter. People say that they don't matter. Even the people who say that they don't matter, they end up referencing them and the, you know, rate of change of those Measures, at least as a KPI. So they certainly have some bearing on the valuation. I obviously think that they do matter. But this has implications, right? Like if we live in a world where, you know, TRADFI is coming and the regulatory barriers for them investing in the space decline, why wouldn't they look at the fees that these systems are generating that flow back to stakers and token holders.
00:40:58.895 - 00:41:33.335, Speaker C: So, you know, this is incredibly important, driven mostly by meme coin activity on Solana. But again, you guys know how I feel about that and it's just really exciting to see there's real earnings power for these tokens. And I think that the more this compounds, the more precisely we can measure it. Contrasted with the, contrasted with monetary premium, which like you simply can't measure. It's kind of like no question to me, like how we're going to value these things going forward and what's going to matter to the incremental trad.
00:41:36.035 - 00:42:05.895, Speaker B: I mostly agree with you about the real economic value stuff. I do agree with you because the charts are right there. But I've become Inc now. I am a Solana bull and I have been for a really, really long time. No flex. But what I do want to say is I am a little bit concerned about free things and I think like they're not enough of a concern for me to be like, oh, Ethereum is better. But it is stuff that I think people aren't necessarily focusing on and talking about.
00:42:05.895 - 00:42:38.015, Speaker B: The first one is unlocks. Solana unlocks are happening and they'll continue to happen, like from investors. Number two is emissions. Solana has high emission rates, which I think it won't ever get that like store of value narrative, which is fine, that's historically been a meme. But going forward, if it doesn't, if it isn't a meme, that might be something interesting to think about. And number three is I am worried about fire dancing. Not that it won't work, but that it won't work as well as people think it should.
00:42:38.015 - 00:43:07.721, Speaker B: And the main thing is now grass airdrop didn't affect the chain too much. It did okay. You still couldn't get a transaction through for some time. Like Solana gets congested and your transactions fail. Like on Ethereum you have to pay more, but on Solana you just have to try it like 15 times in a row. I think it's fine for now and I think Firedance will probably help. But that's my only concern is that it's the bull and you can't get a fucking Transaction on Solana.
00:43:07.721 - 00:43:45.717, Speaker B: Now, we've historically seen that the narrative around congestion and transactions failing and chains not working if it's due to activity is bullish. People will say, oh, it's because like the chain is being used too much. So like last cycle it was fine. But I just think, like, not enough people are talking about it. And it's something that should be like, if I'm the tradfi institution that's coming in and saying, oh, like, look at the fees on this bad boy. You know, Solif, look at the chart looks fantastic. I think you should still consider that there are some of these risks involved that I think a lot of the market ignores.
00:43:45.717 - 00:44:10.995, Speaker B: Especially the thing around the unlocks regarding discounted tokens sold like past year, I think something that we ignore quite a bit. So this is my, like, I guess my point is Blockworks research isn't only bullposting Solana. We also care about the potential risks involved. What do you think? It's probably a nothing burger, but I think it's ignored.
00:44:11.575 - 00:44:37.751, Speaker C: Yeah, right. The interesting thing is, the interesting things about framing those risks is that we did not mention another chain. Like, we didn't mention a competitor. The, the unlocks, I think like 15 of the supply is locked and then you have a 7% inflation rate. Like that's, it's not huge. Especially, I mean, look at the new chains that have launched. Like their floats are, you know, infinitesimal compared to what's locked.
00:44:37.751 - 00:45:21.943, Speaker C: So like from a relative basis, not that concern there. If you're staking, if you're liquid staking, which anyone in size will be, like, you're not, you know, you cut that potential supply overhang in half. And yeah, I think that the Fire Dancer thing is a risk for sure. Like underwhelming the market. And then like, you know, Salana is going to shift the narrative if it underwhelms, right? It's going to be like, oh, it's about having a second client. It's not about like the speed and performance, but like, I'm excited for the speed and performance because if drift can do 2x the transactions that they did yesterday and they charge the same fee for TR transaction or even just like reduce it by 25% like it's going to be, it's going to be a big deal for them. And now, like, and it shouldn't be a 2x, right? It should be more than that.
00:45:21.943 - 00:46:06.351, Speaker C: So, yeah, like Fire Dancer to me is the biggest risk, but because it's such a slow rollout, like, I don't think it has the potential to like underwhelm the market like in the same way that a, like a bad earnings report from a tradfi company will be right. Like we're expecting this rollout like slowly over 12 months. And I think that kind of mitigates that risk from like a token price perspective obviously long term like you need to get to something like a million TPS do I think like really, I hate kind of using this phraseology but like win the space. I think you need to get somewhere there before everyone else. So you know, I think that that's critical for like maximum outcome for Solana. But you know, we'll see.
00:46:06.543 - 00:46:41.855, Speaker A: I also don't, I agree with you in the sense that I don't think that the emissions are that big of a deal because I mean look at Ethereum. Ethereum basically has less rounding era zero emissions like 0 point something percent per year. Sometimes deflationary, sometimes slightly and that really, you know, it's more the demand side that matters. And but then also why, why are people buying Soul right now over eth. You know, are people going on, on online looking at charts saying oh look at it, look at the rev today. Look at the projected rev. The let's, let's look at revenues and burn rates.
00:46:41.855 - 00:47:26.395, Speaker A: No, people are just, people are just buying sold because everybody's using the network when people onboarding what are you doing? You're on sold. Right. So it does, right now it does kind of feel it has more of that, sorry to say it monetary, speculative, commodity, whatever insert would hair premium that and, and that's the reason why Soul is going up because of the, the same network he felt built from having a great chain and you know, just all vertically integrated. So I, I do think in the future, I do think it matters now rev revenue burn and stuff. But I, and I think it will matter more in the future. But for at the moment I don't think people are doing the kind of deep analysis that maybe you and I do every day before like looking at before putting money into these chains.
00:47:27.815 - 00:48:09.925, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a good point and I think that's something that we, we've had a bit of a shift this year where like fundamentals matter more. But I think like you said, at the end of the day people are buying the token for the chain that they use. I don't know how retail dominated the space still is but I'm sure that people see that a lot of people are using Solana and are thus more interested in Solano. Over Ethereum. And Ryan, the reason that I didn't mention another token is because I didn't want people to think that I was bullish Eve Soul or something like that. So that's why I didn't bring up any other L1s. I think to end it off, I'm gonna pass the mic over to Mark for his Radium.
00:48:09.925 - 00:48:22.125, Speaker B: Well, you wrote a Radium report a while back, and it's been doing fantastically. So I'm gonna pull up some charts so that you can walk us through it and I can tell you why. Radium is a bad product, but the price is going up.
00:48:22.515 - 00:48:49.043, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a. It's a good segue from Solana, everybody using it to talking about radio, which is like. Which is the number one decks in Solana by. I don't know, choose your metric. But, you know, I think I wrote about it in August and It's up like 100% since. And I, before I go into it, I wanted to show this chart because I wanted to point out that it's not for radium. It's not all about the meme coins.
00:48:49.043 - 00:49:15.597, Speaker A: Like, if we look at this chart here, you kind of see that, you know, SOL usdc, SOL usdt, whatever, any different tier pools. That's the number one. Number one token pairs by volume. Right? So, you know, Meme coin. Meme Coins for my colorblind viewers is like the small little red ish1 on the top of the chart. Right. So, you know, I can't even.
00:49:15.597 - 00:49:34.205, Speaker A: Maybe that's 5% of volumes. But anyway, it ranges between 5 and 20% of volume on, depending on the week. Right. So Radium is a dex that's being used for a lot more trading than just the. Than just Meme coins. Right. That being said, right.
00:49:34.205 - 00:50:05.435, Speaker A: I have this next chart. The thing with Meme coins is that they tend to be a lot. A lot more volatile. And because they're more volatile, they tend to be in the higher tier fee pools. Then that brings in a lot more revenue for Raydium. So, like, you see here, like, since like the September, August lows, Meme coins are back in. And so the revenue that Raydium is making from this trading volume is a lot higher because of the T fare fee tier.
00:50:05.435 - 00:50:36.107, Speaker A: And, you know, last week I think I tweeted out that Raydium used a portion of their revenues. They do this on a weekly basis to buy back their tokens. Last week they bought back three and a half million dollars worth of Raydium. And this is like a programmatic buyback that they do three and a half million in one week. Three and a half million is probably more than many tokens make in revenue in a year. Right. And this is, this is used to buy back the token and some of it is used for payments emissions.
00:50:36.107 - 00:51:03.655, Speaker A: Some of it is used just goes to the balance sheet. But their buybacks, if you annualize it, it's like 12% buybacks per year. And then for context, Apple does 2% buybacks per year. Meta probably does around 3%. So 12% is high. No matter tradfi terms, no matter how you spin it, that's a lot of buybacks. And then I think also what I like about it is the valuation still.
00:51:03.655 - 00:51:29.575, Speaker A: When I wrote about it in the end of August, it was trading at a price to earnings of I think just under four. Right. And right. You know, the tokens doubled and revenues gone up a bit. So you know, I think the last I kind of checked the PE was around a 10x. Right. I mean for reference, average S P 500 companies, 16xPE ratio.
00:51:29.575 - 00:52:03.439, Speaker A: So by that metric it's cheap. And if you want to get, you know, really pedantic which as an analyst I'm going to these, these earnings are USDC tokens. Right. This is cash, this is cash flow, operating cash flow for the business. Right. So if you really want to value it on cash flow, the average, the average S&P 500 company is probably like 30 something. And you know, Radium now is probably like around 10 because it's the same thing as earnings, cash flow earnings, the same thing.
00:52:03.439 - 00:52:53.865, Speaker A: So I mean it's doubled in price but it's, you know, it's still attractive, it's still the number one dex and it's not reliant on meme coins for volume. And that being said, I do think, you know, there's some, you know, a lot of the volume come, a lot of the meme coin volume, I.e. revenue comes from pump that fund because of, you know, it's programmatic after it reaches a certain market cap. So I think that, you know, I know Pump fund might want to launch its own exchange which might, you know, see itself as a competitor. And I know Jupiter, which ends up routing a lot of volume to Raydium, launched their own Ape Pro or something like that, some their own meme coin making or trading stuff so that you know, people are seeing the kind of revenues and earnings that Radium are making and they want to tap into some of that. So there, there is competition creeping up right now but for now it's the market leader.
00:52:54.205 - 00:53:21.319, Speaker B: Radium is just so, so clear to the point that all activities on Solana like you said, all meme coin activities on Solana and meme coins earn the most fees. So it just makes sense for how much money radium is making. Three and a half miles crazy. They pay 10x that to on optimism. They pay 10x step to get L2s to launch on Richard. So that could also be used. I don't know how else to include Ethereum into any conversation.
00:53:21.319 - 00:53:27.715, Speaker B: It's literally just, oh, we did BD. We paid 50. Ryan, do you have any useful, useful takes?
00:53:30.015 - 00:53:37.195, Speaker C: I, I think that, you know, when did you release this report, mark? On. On August 27th or.
00:53:37.495 - 00:53:39.755, Speaker A: Yeah, I think around that.
00:53:40.535 - 00:54:03.905, Speaker C: How many funds have we seen come out public and say like I'm buying the radium token within the last like two weeks. Right. Like, I feel like it's been more than a handful and that's just the ones that came out publicly and said and, and have said it. So I think it's a fantastic story and a really, really great, great report.
00:54:04.405 - 00:54:15.715, Speaker B: Hi Mark, Ryan, thanks for coming on listeners. Thank you for listening. Anything you're dying to tell our listeners. Mark, we'll let you have the last word today.
00:54:17.135 - 00:54:25.335, Speaker A: I think I ended up last time with. I was still bullish on ETH because of ETFs. And I'm just going to reiterate that. Do not fade the ETFs. That's it.
