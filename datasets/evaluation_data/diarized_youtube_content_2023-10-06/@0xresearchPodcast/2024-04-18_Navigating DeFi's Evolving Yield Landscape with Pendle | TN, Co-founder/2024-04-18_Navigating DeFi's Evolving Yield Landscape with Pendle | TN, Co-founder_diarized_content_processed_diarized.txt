00:00:00.160 - 00:00:38.584, Speaker A: When we cross reference the state of Defi to, say, a mature financial ecosystem, it just occurred to us that fixed income product is one of the largest pillars of any financial sector and it was absent in crypto. We were thinking about ideas and solution, and the splitting of yield appealed to us because it allowed us to build on top of other reputable and big protocols like AaVE and compound and take their yield bearing assets and then do the splitting of PT and YT and allow these two components to be traded independently.

00:02:04.764 - 00:02:28.764, Speaker D: What's up everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We have an awesome episode lined up today with TN, one of the co founders of Pendle, a DeFi protocol that enables users to tokenize and sell future yield. And as a reminder, before we dive into the interview, you can use code zero x research ten at app dot blockworksresearch.com for 10% off your annual subscription. Now onto the interview with Tien. Thanks for joining us, man.
00:02:29.624 - 00:02:32.664, Speaker A: Yeah, glad to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:02:32.784 - 00:02:42.484, Speaker D: Of course, of course. So before we get started and dive deep into the details of this, can you kind of explain at a high level what Pendle is and how it works and maybe the problems it's aiming to solve?
00:02:43.484 - 00:03:25.710, Speaker A: Yeah. So panel is a protocol to tokenize and trade yield. So the way we do it is to tokenize a yield bearing asset into PTMYT. So PT refers to principal token and then YT for yield token. So without going into the mechanics here, the. The use cases that we're trying to enable with Pendle is firstly to enable fixed rates. So, like, if a user wants to obtain fixed yield on a certain asset, then getting PT is an option.
00:03:25.710 - 00:03:35.354, Speaker A: And then if on the other side, if a user wants to speculate on yield, then buying YT is the. Is, is the more capital efficient way of doing so.
00:03:35.714 - 00:03:59.254, Speaker B: Gotcha. And then one of the follow up there, I think Pando has seen a few evolutions from the start, and it's actually been really exciting seeing you guys sort of evolve. Would you mind just walking us through the entire pando journey? Perhaps just going back to like, why you started it, where you got the origination from, and sort of like going through the Amm idea and sort of v two and just walking us through the life cycle of the product so far?
00:03:59.634 - 00:04:57.894, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So the idea of penal came about during DeFi summer in 2020, because, like my co founders and I, we were farming a lot of food coins that were offering ten, 20,000% APY. We wanted to capture as much yield as we could, but there was no instrument for us to do so, because on the one hand, we knew that the yields were fleeting. So we were very comfortable with just taking a lower yield, but try to lock it in while we can, while we're still. While the rates were still relevant. But it wasn't like there was no option to do so. And when we cross reference the state of DeFi to, say, a mature financial ecosystem, it just occurred to us that fixed income product is one of the largest pillars of any financial sector, and it was absent in crypto.
00:04:57.894 - 00:06:18.436, Speaker A: So I think that was the core motivation for us to think about a product that could serve our needs, because I think innately we all value some sort of certainty, and we couldn't do that on crypto. So we were thinking about ideas and solution, and the splitting of yield appealed to us because it allowed us to built on top of other reputable and big protocols like AaVE and compound. I mean, at that point, they were already doing, they were already sitting on around $20 billion of TvL collectively. So we thought it would make sense for us to be complementary to these big protocols and take their yield bearing assets and then do the splitting of PT and YT, and allow these two components to be traded independently. So we went live in June 2021, not to a lot of fanfare, because I think it was a very crowded time, and there were so many different products that were out during then, and they were offering much better and more attractive yields than what pandle could do. So we didn't see a lot of traction in the beginning. And I think aside from just the APY itself, the UI UX wasn't the best because we.
00:06:18.436 - 00:07:03.804, Speaker A: It was the first implementation and it was, there was no precedence. So we had to make a lot of assumptions about how users would react or respond to certain kind of numbers. And the education, the learning curve was actually pretty steep because we were introducing terms that were quite native to Pendle, right? Like YTPT, for one. And then there were also implied yields and things like that. So it's a lot to absorb and no one has the patience to go through that. But I think we saw some sort of hope when we listed a very degen asset in the form of Wonderland time. They were.
00:07:03.804 - 00:08:12.398, Speaker A: Again, I can't remember exactly what was the APY, but it was like four to five digit. So when we listed that asset, we saw a lot of traction. I think in the beginning we were probably doing maybe one hundred k, fifty k kind of trading volume on a daily basis. But when we had that very Degen asset and we started to tokenize yield and make the yield tradable, we reached a peak of $5 million in trading volume in a very short span of time. But the whole thing, I think it came down fairly quickly when there were some incidents over at Wonderland, and then the maturity also, we reached a maturity, and then we decided not to continue the pool, but fast forward, I think we had a lot of learnings there and observations of how users behaved on our platform. So we took a lot of that observations and learnings and incorporated those into Pendle V two. So for a good part of 2022, it was just us rebuilding the product.
00:08:12.398 - 00:09:19.454, Speaker A: And then eventually we launched Pandel V two at the end of 2022. So last year, 2023, we had relatively good traction. It was climbing steadily, but we were very fortunate to have been associated with a few narratives. So, for example, in January last year, we were more affiliated with LST narrative. So I remember in January last year, we developed a case study together with aura Balancer and rocket pool in enabling users to earn something like 15% APY on ETH. So that was a pretty popular product, and I think it gave us the first glimpse of what users would probably want from our product. And then later in Q one, we also became more associated with arbitram branding because we decided to go on to l two because of guest considerations.
00:09:19.454 - 00:09:23.886, Speaker A: And then at that point in time, arbitram was also gaining very, very good traction.
00:09:23.990 - 00:09:48.594, Speaker D: So maybe zooming out a little bit, by the way, that was really helpful. Context. I appreciate the history lesson on pendle, but can you maybe express, like, from a position standpoint, like, how would you express being bullish on the e staking yield as a steeth holder or bearish the ETH staking yield? And conversely, like, how would you express, you know, being bullish or bearish the ETH underlying price?
00:09:50.004 - 00:11:06.006, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think, like, if you're bullish on the ETH staking yield, let's say, because usually it fluctuates anywhere between three and 6%. And let's say you think that it's going to go beyond 6%, what the best way to do it is probably to buy the YT. So buying yT, you're effectively buying into the, the yield accrual between the time of entry all the way to maturity. Because here the assumption is that at maturity, your annualized yield is going to be more than, let's say, 6%. And if it's trading at say, 4% today at maturity, you would collect more yield just by holding Yt pay it out from, from Lido and maturity, if you're correct, you would be earning extra yield from what you paid. So that difference becomes your earning. Now, in contrast, if you do not believe that the yield is going to be high in, let's say, at maturity, what you can do is you can sell away your Yt.
00:11:06.006 - 00:11:55.524, Speaker A: So after minting PTy, sell away the YT so that you don't get exposed to the floating yield. You convert that into liquid, sorry. Like stablecoin, for example, or the underlying asset immediately, and then you can use it to deploy into some other venues or just hold it. So I think, like, yeah, these are, these are just some ways, but of course, like, you can also express, like, similar views in the form of PT. So PT is basically a reverse of what you would do with Yt. So in the event that you are bullish, then you can sell Pt. And if you're, if you're bearish on the yield, just buy my Pt.
00:11:57.384 - 00:12:27.096, Speaker B: Gotcha. That's a super helpful explanation. I think one thing that I've been super impressive is just the general growth, especially in the sort of LRT narrative part of Pendle's journey. I mean, I wrote a research report on Pendo last year. At that point, it was around August, you guys were sitting at maybe 140 million in TVL. And I think at that point, like, annualized fees was like maybe 150,000 or something. And today you're at basically 4 billion TVL fees have gone parabolic.
00:12:27.096 - 00:12:42.004, Speaker B: In conjunction, at least on Defi llama essays, is around 20 plus million analyzed. Why do you think that so much growth came from sort of like, incorporating pendle into the LRT narrative versus, like, all of these other narratives?
00:12:44.184 - 00:13:16.714, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think, like, for us, we've definitely benefited substantially from these major narratives. And I think, um, the restaking narrative is very substantial because it. I think it's almost like the. The baseline expectation of, um, of. Of yield across crypto in general. So if there's something that, um.
00:13:16.714 - 00:14:23.244, Speaker A: That is as revolutionary as Eigen layer coming about naturally, there's going to be a lot of interest and demand for it. So I think for us, again, looking back over the last one and a half year of operating panel v two, we have had several accelerated growth periods. And all of this happened because we were able to associate our brand with these big movements. So we were leveraging on the likes of lsts, arbitrum, and real world assets and LRT to give us that momentum to grow. And then more recently, I think we're also exploring, like, just expanding the points narrative. So moving slightly beyond and above LRT, and also worked on non LRT assets like Athena, but achieving a similar kind of purpose to enable points trading and users to speculate on yield.
00:14:24.904 - 00:14:52.914, Speaker B: Following up there, there's a lot of interesting sort of trading poos on Pendo. You know, like, some are, like, basically duplicates of each other, but they have, like, extra points bonuses. How do you think about those partnerships? Are those, like, behind the scene conversations that always occur with, like, these different LRT teams? Or is it sort of like, more of them approaching you? So what's like, the. I guess, like, the BD sort of partnership strategy there with, like, all of these points? Craziness?
00:14:53.654 - 00:15:55.152, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think the BD aspect is actually very important. So the product is important, but in this particular instance, as with most of the different, like, narrative implementations that we've had in the past year, BD is definitely an important part of it. So, specific to the points, what BD has to do is to identify the right kind of protocols and projects to work with and then come to an agreement on something as simple as multiplier. Because we are positioning pandle as a venue to help grow TVL. So if we look at pandle today, um, Pandel actually accounts for a pretty sizable portion of TVL across most of these bigger lrts, as well as Athena. And I think when we started out, it's, it's, it matches who we work with.
00:15:55.152 - 00:16:53.674, Speaker A: And the first 1st example is actually very important to construct a use case that allows us to, to go to the other protocols and then just give them something as a reference. So very fortunately for us, our first partner was Etherfi and they were also very generous with the multiplier. So when we suggested a multiplier and they were receptive to it, we went with it. And I think in a relatively short span of time we saw a very significant surge in the interest. And then the rest of it is really just trying to improve on the UI UX. So from the start of the year until now, we have refined the UI UX quite substantially. Added limit, order added like the order book, so that users can see the liquidity and the depth of the pool.
00:16:53.674 - 00:17:23.584, Speaker A: We also added a points UI just to give user an idea of how much leverage that they are entitled to if they were to purchase yT, for example. So these are the little things that happen subsequently, but that's more on the product side. And then of course like for BD, it's always a matter of identifying who best to work with and what kind of products that the community wants to see.
00:17:25.264 - 00:18:00.654, Speaker B: I wanted to follow up there on sort of like the explosive LRT growth. Obviously there's just a lot of sort of idiosyncratic trading opportunities on panda right now. For a lot of these LRT tokens, you're seeing fixed APIs of 50, 60, sometimes 70%. Are you concerned about once all of these LRT protocols launch the tokens, their season one points program ends, that trading volume like significantly subsides. Or how are you thinking about life after like all of these protocols, LRT protocols, logic tokens and like points program ends?
00:18:01.754 - 00:19:12.794, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think with, with points program. My view is that the points program are always, points programs are always the intermediary between like say a main net and the actual token launch. So it is a way for protocols to gain traction and just prior to the actual token launch. So for us, I think the strategy here is to be aggressive to identify the protocols that we can work with. And then I think when the protocol is ready to convert those points into tokens, then the pools will gradually, I mean, the pools will mature and then we probably wouldn't continue. But in the meantime, what we can do is to identify different segments that we can work with because I'm of the opinion that points has now become quite a substantial go to market strategy for a lot of these protocols, right? Whether it's l one, l two, whichever it is like. As an example, we are working with circuit to enable certain markets and deposits into circuits contracts.
00:19:12.794 - 00:19:39.280, Speaker A: The pool is not sorry that the chain is not live, but they already have a substantial amount of traction because they just searched past a billion dollars in TBL in the last week or so. So we think this is potentially an angle that we can work on beyond just LRT post Eigen layer post Athena. I think that there are many other options that we can work with.

00:22:04.126 - 00:22:15.274, Speaker D: Ren mentioned the exploding fee revenue generation, and I know Pendle, the token plays a role here. Can you kind of explain pendle, ve pendle and value accrual for the token protocol in general?
00:22:16.014 - 00:22:54.770, Speaker A: Yeah. So when Pendle gets locked up for like between one week and two years, it can be locked for vPandel. So vpandel actually serves three purposes. Firstly, it functions as a booster for the liquidity provider. So if you have a LP position on Pendle and you have ve pendle, you should be entitled to some form of multiplier, up to two and a half times of the base Apy. So that's one. And then secondly, which is also very important, is the voting.
00:22:54.770 - 00:24:00.024, Speaker A: It functions as a voting right for incentive channeling because on a weekly basis there is an emission that the protocol could use to incentivize liquidity. And the distribution of the incentive is very, is 100% dependent on the votes. So like, for example, if I want this, I want incentive to be channeled to the pool of my choice, I vote for my pool. And then if the pool gets more incentive, then naturally I become a beneficiary as well. And the third is a follow up to the second. Now, as a voter of pools incentives, I'm also entitled to some fees. So because the pool will generate swap fees from Amna amm traits, as a voter of the pool, if the pool makes money, I can earn, um, I can earn a portion of that.
00:24:01.684 - 00:24:20.714, Speaker D: Interesting. Okay, so it's, it's very similar to, to curve and curve gauges, it sounds like. So have you seen, uh, similar dynamics play out with ve pendle in that? As with ve curve, with like large daos kind of accumulating? Or is it more individuals you think that you've seen making these votes?
00:24:21.294 - 00:24:50.354, Speaker A: So at the moment, it's mostly individuals. We do have three liquid lockers in the form of equilibria pen PI and steak Dao. So collectively, across the board, about 20% of all pendle is locked in a ve pendle contract, and a sizable portion of that went through these three different outlets.
00:24:51.814 - 00:25:20.164, Speaker B: I had a curious question, heading back to the LRT side of things. Have you guys ever considered issuing your own LRt or LST? Given that just thinking it through it super quickly, it seems like vertical integration might potentially be a move, since you guys have a need to attract that liquidity anyway. Maybe like, there's additional fee revenue or additional, like, stickiness from launching your own LST and LFT. Curious to hear if you've ever thought about that.
00:25:20.824 - 00:25:50.004, Speaker A: No, I think. I think, yeah, I mean, strategically speaking, we are better off working with everyone and then becoming the venue to trade for users expressive you than to be in the field and compete against everyone else. I don't think we're that great in that sense, and we're better off sticking to our core.
00:25:51.544 - 00:26:09.564, Speaker D: Have you seen any interesting primitives outside of Pendle and the core contributors to the Pendle protocol? Any integrations with PTS or YT? And if you haven't, which ones would you like to see pop up? Interesting use cases for these tokens.
00:26:10.704 - 00:27:25.444, Speaker A: So I think PT as an asset, as a collateral for money markets can actually be quite interesting. We've seen several money markets like silo, dolomite, time swap, taking in PT as collateral, and then it encouraged some sort of looping strategies for users to maximize their yield, fixed yield. So that is in itself like, I think quite, quite exciting. I believe that there is also room for CDP product because, like PT, even at maturity, right. At maturity, PT will be redeemable one to one for the underlying. So effectively, if there is a CDP product and PT is used as a collateral, I think it will function very similarly to the likes of, say, liquitey using some other assets. But in this case, the earning of the under, like the collateral, fixed yield is known, and then just letting it out to earn additional yield would be pretty interesting.
00:27:25.444 - 00:28:31.720, Speaker A: I'm not too sure if anyone's building a CDP product on PT, but I think it's not a very difficult concept to imagine. And then there's also index of YT's, because I think YT is actually a pretty interesting asset. It represents the yield and currently the points. So if you buy into, say, an LRT's YT, you have an exposure in the points of the LRT protocol as well as the eigen layer points. And of course on top of that, the native staking yield. So I think the role of an index could be to diversify the exposure to the different types of LRT. So instead of buying individually the different types of YT's, I can just subscribe to, to an index product, and it helps purchase and gain exposure to all these different lrts.
00:28:31.720 - 00:28:44.124, Speaker A: So, yeah, it is, I think, a relatively reasonable product, not very difficult to educate users about, and I think it should gain decent traction.
00:28:44.904 - 00:28:59.804, Speaker B: Just a random idea for integration, but I feel like integration with perp Dex for PT might make a lot of sense just because your collateral will be yield varying and that might be an additional advantage for the perfect, but just throwing ideas out there.
00:29:00.704 - 00:29:02.724, Speaker A: Yeah. Maybe something to propose.
00:29:03.104 - 00:29:26.674, Speaker B: Yeah. Another question I wanted to ask is what are some interesting user behaviors that you see for Pendo? You know, like, what's the average trade size, what's the frequency, what's the leverage involved? Is it like a small, like Djen holding like a $100 off, like a certain PT, or I said like institutional capital and pendle, sort of like doing an interest rate, sort of like derivative swap trade?
00:29:28.374 - 00:30:16.954, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think in terms of user behavior in the, I'd say last year and this year, it's changed quite a bit because the demographic has become more diversified and it's also increased. So last year, market wasn't doing so well. People who are interested in a product like pandle, they're generally more sophisticated. So we were not at the point of targeting big institutions, but there were institutions, sorry. There were individuals who work for big institutions with good understanding of derivatives. They would take part in pendle markets because to them, it's probably not a very difficult concept to understand and appreciate.
00:30:16.954 - 00:31:26.206, Speaker A: So I think a bulk of our user last year was composed of this profile, so sophisticated, relatively DJN, with a good understanding of derivative. Now, this year, because of the points, and because of like, better display of implied leverage for YT, PtE, whatever it is, and because of the more attractive numbers, fixed yield LP, we've attracted a broader base of users. So some of these users, they don't necessarily know how to read the chart. They might not have very good understanding of what yield, implied yield APY APR, the differences are, and we've also encountered users who would ape without really knowing what the product is about. So it's very mixed. I'd say. But we've also seen bigger institutions participating in size in the past year.
00:31:26.206 - 00:32:11.814, Speaker A: I think we wouldn't like any trade that's several hundred thousand of dollar would be considerably big and rare. But this year, because, for example, PT of LRT assets, they could trade at 50, 60, or 70% of fixed Apy. And the pools are reasonably sizable. Most of them have more than $100 million in liquidity. And as an institution, 50% APY. Fixed APY is very attractive. And if you're operating, if you're managing size, you can go in 2000, 3000 ETH and lock in that yield.
00:32:11.814 - 00:32:41.688, Speaker A: It makes a lot of difference to the overall P and L. So this year we started to see more of that kind of behavior. And when users bidded the YT price up to a certain level, then, because when YT price gets very inflated, the discount on PT also becomes much more substantial. And then we see big whales coming in to scoop up a sizable amount of PT and then rebalance the dynamics between PT and YT.
00:32:41.736 - 00:33:01.764, Speaker B: Again, I wanted to follow up there on the institution fund. I know you guys have a head of institution, Ken, and I'm curious what those conversations look like. What are some common pushbacks that you receive from large institutional fund managers when you tell them about Pendle and how they can potentially trade on Pendle?
00:33:03.704 - 00:33:56.960, Speaker A: It also varies quite substantially. So generally, I'd say, like, if it's a hedge fund, like Defi specific, let's say like $20 to $50 million in Aum, not a lot of convincing needed to do. Most of them would be more concerned or look deeper into the security aspect of things. So, by now, we have already done seven rounds of audit. We take security very seriously. And then we're also expecting another round of audit next month, just to make sure our contracts, the contract reviews are updated. So I'd say, like, for defi natives, that is usually the consideration for other types of institutions that are maybe more threat fi.
00:33:56.960 - 00:35:12.570, Speaker A: But looking into defi opportunities, I think a couple of different considerations are, firstly, like whether the. So aside from the basic security considerations, it's also a matter of insurance. Having some sort of insurance products, whether it's by third party or directly by the protocol, would give them some form of assurance. And then, yeah, overall APY, everybody cares about APY, but I think being able to get a certain amount of APY in size is a fairly big consideration. So, just to do a comparison, right, last year, because the protocol was significantly smaller, if we were to, let's say, trade $50,000 worth of YT, it would incur maybe one to 2% of price impact this year. It's a different case, but if they were to do a million or $2 million worth of YT trade, I would suspect that the price impact would be also very considerable. So it becomes more operational considerations like that.
00:35:12.570 - 00:35:23.794, Speaker A: And, of course, like, then you have, like, the very big ones. They are already trading crypto products, but because of regulatory reasons, they are still not involved in Defi.
00:35:24.454 - 00:35:43.424, Speaker D: From a builder's perspective, I'd love to just hear why you chose arbitrum and how that experience has gone. I believe you guys were a recipient of the first round of steps, which I'm sure was pretty helpful. But I guess just looking back on the decision to deploy on arbitrum, do you have any regrets or, like, what kind of aspects went into that decision?
00:35:45.564 - 00:36:35.216, Speaker A: Definitely no regrets. We've been great beneficiary of the growth of arbitram, so we grew together with arbitram. Arbitram foundation has also been very supportive. When we went over where the first yield trading product on the chain, they help with education. They help aside from just, like, monetary support, it was also publicity, and we needed that kind of endorsement as a product that, like, I think this is, this is very valid for most builders. The product can be good, but if it doesn't have any kind of recognition, it will still be a bad product. So we've learned from seeing many other protocols.
00:36:35.216 - 00:37:05.504, Speaker A: The tech is solid and excellent, but no one's really talking about it. So they end up not getting a lot of traction, and then they become forgotten. We don't want to go down that route. And Arbitrum provides a lot more support on the, like, on intangibles like this, more so than some other ecosystems that we've worked with or spoken with. I think that actually makes a lot of difference.
00:37:06.724 - 00:37:16.024, Speaker D: Are there any aspirations to go multi chain with deployments, or are you guys just focusing on building out the product within arbitrum and finding product market fit there?
00:37:16.604 - 00:38:16.672, Speaker A: Yeah. So the expansion to other ecosystems, always on the table, but now, because of resources and time, it's also a considerate, like, there's an opportunity cost, like, if we want to go. I don't think it makes a lot of sense for us to go too broad, because Pendle is a second order derivative, and with us, Pendle would only make sense when, like, there's a layer of primitive that is already very established. For example, LRT protocols. If they're not on a certain ecosystem, then it really doesn't matter to have Pendle there because there wouldn't be any yield to trade. So for now, we are taking a very, I think, pragmatic approach and just looking at how some of our core partners expand. Like, if, let's say, Athena expands to mental.
00:38:16.672 - 00:38:29.764, Speaker A: We went ahead with it and deployed a mental implementation, and if they want to go somewhere else, that would really, I mean, we'll definitely consider it much more seriously.
00:38:30.864 - 00:39:53.624, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that is definitely the right move. You guys are live on Ethereum, arbitrum, BNB, chain, optimism and mantle today. And just wherever the narrative goes to, like, you guys are very opportunistic in a good way, and I think that makes a lot of sense. One question I did want to ask is, my knowledge may not be perfect here, but in the world of tradfi and interest rate swaps or derivatives, right? For example, a fixed for floating rate swap in tradfi, like, one party streams like the fixed rate to the other, one party streams like the floating rate to the other, and maybe, like, both of them put up some form of collateral, right? But in my head, that collateral probably doesn't need to be the full amount of collateral needed to support that amount of, like, yield being streamed, as long as, like, maybe like some small amount of collateral to, like, account for the differences between the float and fixed yield. Whereas for Pendle's case, you kind of need, like, one unit of the underlying to be able to sort of generate this one unit of yield type of trading opportunity. So I think it's fair to say that, like, panda was a lot less capital efficient than the world of tradfi interest rate derivatives. Do you think that's a concern long term? And how do you think we potentially overcome that lack of capital efficiency for interest rate derivatives on chain?
00:39:54.564 - 00:40:41.154, Speaker A: Yeah, so concern, not so much. I think this is a safer way to enable rates trading, at least with respect to Pendle V two. But I do see the point that you brought up, and that is actually one of the, one of the components that we are looking to incorporate in our design for v three, because, yeah, again, like treadfi is all about capital efficiency, so. And then leverage, like what you pointed out. So these are very significant considerations. I'm in no position to disclose too much, but I think this is something that we're internally very much looking forward to.
00:40:42.374 - 00:40:50.142, Speaker D: I guess that's a good time to ask what is on the roadmap for the rest of the year? What are your main priorities, if you're able to provide any more clarity on.
00:40:50.158 - 00:41:19.104, Speaker A: That front yeah, so we have hit a pretty sweet spot with the points trading, and we want to double down on that, but at the same time, we also need to construct and improve on the product, so the effort will split between continuing our traction with points and building v three. So, yeah, I think we are pretty focused there.
00:41:19.604 - 00:41:30.774, Speaker B: Following up on that question. Ten years down the road, which is an eternity in crypto, where would you like Pendle to be? What would you like Pendle to be?
00:41:31.514 - 00:42:22.434, Speaker A: Yeah, I've always aspired pendle to be known as a blue chip product within Defi. I hope that because of Pendle, we can see much bigger impact across the Defi ecosystem. In exactly how, I'm not too sure, but I'd like to think that we can enable a more circular ecosystem, more efficient traits, and because of the way people trade yield, something like yield curve can happen, and then, yeah, more fixed rate products. So it's very abstract at the moment. I know, but I think one of the biggest draws of DeFi is really just Apy's yield. And as long as yield exists, there will be a room for Pendle to. To work on.
00:42:22.434 - 00:42:51.034, Speaker A: And I think right now, we're barely touching the surface, because there's a lot more different types of yield that we're still not working on. For example, borrowing yield, which is, I'd say, a bread and butter of any money market. Funding rates. Yeah, lending rates. So these are all the different types of rates that I think we can work on, but we have not really started on targeting these yet.
00:42:52.294 - 00:43:23.054, Speaker B: One thing that you guys do really well is education, and I think that's been, like, a slow process over the past few months. You guys have that Pendo intern account, which always puts out great trading ideas. You guys have a bunch of educational resources at this point. It's lessons, literally, on pendle finance, the PT, the YT, the complexities of the protocol. How do you think about educating the users over time, and, like, what are some strategies that you think have worked really well?
00:43:25.234 - 00:44:08.710, Speaker A: Education is very difficult. If anything, I think this is probably one of the most challenging aspect of running a complex product, because, like, Uniswap, you don't really have to educate. It's very intuitive. But for something like Pendle, like it or not, I think this is what we are, we have to deal with, and we see it as an opportunity for us to inculcate certain concepts and then give user a better understanding of how things work. The mechanics. In terms of education, I don't think there's a. Okay, again, to be specific in terms of strategy, I think it really varies from product to product.
00:44:08.710 - 00:45:10.904, Speaker A: But for us specifically, what we did was aside from just having the materials in place, it's also about the dissemination of it. I think far too many times a lot of people focus on the construct of the content, but they don't think too much about the distribution of the content. For us, we're trying to balance both. So content has to be in place first and foremost. And then in terms of dissemination, it's identifying the right types of people to work with, because if they get the product and most of them, after they realize the potential of pandle, they become very strong advocates. So we started to basically in the early days we were identifying high quality content creators to work with. They might not necessarily be the biggest account, but they put in the effort to learn about the mechanics and then they became very strong advocates and then they cultivated community of their own and they passed on the knowledge.
00:45:10.904 - 00:45:57.014, Speaker A: So that's one. I think another very important strategy that we went after was to construct use cases like case studies. It's easy to say this protocol can do this and that, but it always helps when people can actually see how things work and then they try it and then they appreciate the process. So when we think about education, it's not just about like the material and of course, like dissemination is important. Right. But we try to reinforce all this material with actual case studies that protocols and third party. Third party protocols users and funds can refer to quite easily.
00:45:57.954 - 00:46:26.014, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I know that trying to get people educated on things is not easy, but I'm sure the, the points craze has definitely helped with motivating people to learn, which is, which is great for you guys. But I was curious, wanted to throw you a softball on just market opportunity here. How big is the interest rate derivative market in traditional finance? And how big is it on chain today? And like, where do you see this growing over the next maybe two to three years? And what changes need to be made in order to get there?
00:46:27.914 - 00:47:27.356, Speaker A: Again, very tough question. It's very big. It's a couple of hundred trillion in size. In treadfi specific crypto, I think it's a fraction of that also because crypto is significantly smaller than tradfi out there. But in terms of enablers, I think what we do is quite important in enabling the market to grow, especially in the form of v three, because ultimately when we look at crypto, a big part of it is yield. We're not just looking at ETH staking yield and ETH staking yield at the moment is probably the reference rate. But at the same time, if we look across different ecosystems, like Cosmos and Solana, these are all different yields that we could potentially capture and trade.
00:47:27.356 - 00:48:01.760, Speaker A: And there is a whole lot of dependency on, like the Solana staking yield, for example, because there are a lot of products that are building on top of Solana and a lot of products building on top of cosmos. So if we could enable some instrument, I hope we could enable that. If we do that, then I think we can reduce a layer of uncertainty for a lot of these protocols and with some certainty, I think, yeah, maybe more different types of use cases could happen, I think.
00:48:01.912 - 00:48:13.764, Speaker B: Sam, do you have any last questions? I think that's all the questions I had on my end. But Tien, is there any sort of last, final thoughts that you wanted to share with our audience? A call to action perhaps, or where they could find you?
00:48:15.464 - 00:48:57.796, Speaker A: Yeah, like to find me. I'm available on Twitter, like TN pandle, also on discord most of the time, so it's not very difficult to reach me. I think we have a fairly interesting lineup of assets that we would be listing in the next couple of weeks. We are constantly experimenting with different types of narratives, and hopefully we could find something more meaningful that could serve the community better. Um, we're here to stay, so, like, there's a lot more that we want to achieve. And I think, yeah, the. The points.
00:48:57.796 - 00:49:04.544, Speaker A: The points trading narrative has given us a very, very important boost, but we're definitely not stopping here.
00:49:05.404 - 00:49:28.244, Speaker B: Nice. That's great to hear. And for the listeners, there are some really, really fantastic trading opportunities out there on Pendo. I am kind of disappointed at myself for not being more active on pendle, especially with the made a decent amount of money from farming. Some of the. Whether that's like Athena or like LRT poo's on there. So there's still time.
00:49:28.244 - 00:49:38.064, Speaker B: There's still time, but thank you so much for coming on Tien. We'll have to get you back on at some point once v three launches and all of these new markets are incorporated later down the year.
00:49:38.804 - 00:49:41.548, Speaker A: Sounds good. Yeah. Thanks for having me. Yep.
00:49:41.596 - 00:49:42.108, Speaker D: Take care.
