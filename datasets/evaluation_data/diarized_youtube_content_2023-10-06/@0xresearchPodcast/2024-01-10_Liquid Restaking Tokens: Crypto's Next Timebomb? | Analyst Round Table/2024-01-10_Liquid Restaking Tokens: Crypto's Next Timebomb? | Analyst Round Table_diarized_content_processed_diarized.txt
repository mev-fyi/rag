00:00:00.250 - 00:00:21.280, Speaker A: If we're gonna start seeing like, high value nfts migrating to bitcoin over Ethereum, like how Ethereum had crypto punks. Like, I could see something like node monkeys, or maybe it's the frogs being the actual, like the blue chip NFT of this cycle and my cat just screamed in the background. But.
00:00:24.210 - 00:00:41.010, Speaker B: What'S up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. March is just around the corner and I wanted to make sure to give you a quick reminder to not top tick your prices of your das London tickets. If you use code zero x ten at checkout, you can lock in a 10% discount on your ticket. Don't miss out on your chance to get ahead of the curve. I'll see you in London.
00:00:41.090 - 00:00:57.482, Speaker C: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. The Blockworks research team is back to bring you another episode of an analyst roundtable. This week we are joined by Ren and Zero X Pibbles. And today is January eigth. Dan, why don't you kick us off with a little bit of what's going on in the market with the news segment?
00:00:57.546 - 00:01:20.258, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. We're recording this on Monday to the eigth, and we haven't heard any approval ETF news yet. But of course the last week, the last few months. But really in the last week, it's been non stop ETF news. So shout out to the Bloomberg fellas, Eric and James. They keep me up to date with what's actually going on. And there's another guy, Scott.
00:01:20.258 - 00:02:12.498, Speaker B: I need to tag all three of them in the show notes for this episode just because I found them super helpful. Obviously, I spend no time in the infrastructure level of the ETF market, so it's been useful to know what these filings mean as they come in and kind of where we are in the market. So they've been calling 90% for a while, I think recently that's probably been bumped up to like 95%, and now we're somewhere hovering around 99%. It seems like all of the filing level work is done at this point. We just got updated fee metrics for, I think, all eleven of the issuers, and that's really what the latest round of news that came through today was exactly about, the fees. So we saw a pretty good price war going on here, which is very interesting that we'll get into. But quickly on the numbers, it seems that fees are ranging somewhere between like 20 bips and 50 bips on Aum.
00:02:12.498 - 00:02:57.860, Speaker B: And don't quote me on this, but I literally googled this. So again, don't quote me on this, but it seems that the way they charge fees on ETFs is by decreasing the aum by the daily fee rate. So obviously the headline numbers are annualized, but taking the daily fee rate and decreasing the Aum, excuse me, the net asset value, which is the redeemable value of the share. So that kind of is interesting to see that gets accrued on a daily basis, but nonetheless, we're ranging between 0.2 and 0.5%, with bitwise coming in at the low end of zero point 24%. A lot of these guys are waiving fees for the first six months until they hit a Aum milestone, which is pretty interesting.
00:02:57.860 - 00:03:37.358, Speaker B: And that's really the question right now, is now that we've seen that they're all low priced fees, this means that everyone has to sell the shit out of these things to make any money on them. And that's kind of why I think bitwise probably went with the lowest end of the spectrum. We'll have to get those guys back on here some point down the line and talk to them. But my reading, the tea leaves of their actions being the lowest priced ETF is this could be a huge marketing thing for them. They could use this fund. If they do win out in the market, then they can use their fund to kind of win the marketing war in some sense, and this helps them sell other business. Whereas maybe somebody like Blackrock, I think their fees were around 0.3.
00:03:37.358 - 00:04:07.420, Speaker B: I want to say I'm not looking at the table right now, so if anyone has that up, please chime in. But somewhere around the neighborhood of 0.3%, and they want to make money off this, that's their goal. They don't need this to be a marketing tool. This is just another weapon in the belt, if you will, for them to make money. But with fees this low as a whole, again, everyone's going to be selling the hell out of this ETF, which long crypto, Twitter, has long wanted tradfi to come and show their bags. And it really does seem like we are in that era now.
00:04:09.890 - 00:04:26.354, Speaker D: Yeah. All right, it's loading. But Blackrock's fee is down to, sorry, I'm doing this live. It's 0.2% before the waiver, but 0.3% normally. So still pretty low.
00:04:26.354 - 00:05:15.666, Speaker D: I think out of all of these, probably the shocker is grayscale. They're choosing to have a fee of 1.5%, which is like basically an order of magnitude larger than everyone else. But you have to remember that Grayscale has 27 billion in Aum in their GBTC product, and they're basically making a bet that not a lot of people are going to switch their ETF issuer. I'm not sure how true that is, especially if it's like I just go to my brokerage account, I click redeem and I click like I want to ape into this other ETF, but I think they'll probably milk it for a while given that Blackrock is probably going to win this competition. I mean, if you're a catfire institution, Blackrock is the Bigfi institution. They might as well be the forefront of the government at this point.
00:05:15.666 - 00:05:48.282, Speaker D: And so you can't really compete with them on sort of the brand name there. And so you just milk your existing holders for a while. I know Gary Gensler tweeted this morning about the risk of investing in crypto assets, and to me that really makes it seem like a done deal. The deadline this morning was 08:00 a.m. Eastern for any last minute filing. So they probably need some time to go through all of the filings to make sure there's nothing wrong. But there's only really two more days left for the SEC to come out and make a decision for all of this.
00:05:48.282 - 00:06:19.320, Speaker D: I think another interesting tweet that I saw from maybe Mike was that everyone's going to lower the fees on the bitcoin ETF, but then they're going to use that as a gateway for higher fees on other etfs, whether that's like Ethereum ETF or say like a salana or like an avalanche or like a Maddox ETF. And those would be higher fees, whereas sort of the bitcoin ETF is kind of like your $5 Roddy chicken at Costco. So, yeah, just a few points.
00:06:19.850 - 00:06:49.150, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting, too. Everyone's already jumping to the ETH ETF narrative, kind of sealing the deal on the bitcoin one. I think it would be kind of ironic if that ends up not actually getting approved. I think that could just be like a really bearish headwind that people are really calculating as like a bullish tailwind. But I really don't think an etHF is solidified at all at this point. Not saying anyone is saying that it is. I just know a lot of people are banking on that becoming a narrative.
00:06:52.130 - 00:07:03.540, Speaker B: Don't kill our hopes and dreams like that. Not only will it be an eth ETF, but it'll be a staked eth ETf generating yield, which is true tradfi, cream of the crop. So that's what we're going to get.
00:07:06.310 - 00:07:08.420, Speaker C: Get the bitwise guys back on.
00:07:09.430 - 00:07:42.526, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. I'd love to get their take, because last time we had them on, we asked something to the effect of, like, all right, last year was, we only care about bitcoin. Now it's expanded to, okay, this e thing sounds cool. And so the next logical expansion of that is, oh, this yield on this e thing sounds cool. But last time we chatted with them, they're like, no, we're not there yet. Right now, if you're allocating to crypto, it's like sub 5% of your portfolio, and only a portion of that would be ETH, and you're buying, say that ETH is a half percent of your portfolio that's being bought to go to 1% or 0%. Right.
00:07:42.526 - 00:08:14.102, Speaker B: You're trying to double your value, and if you don't do that, whatever. And so if you're going for 100% gain, you don't really care to get 3% yield on that. So that was kind of their take on it, which I do get with. I can get behind that. But over the long run, I think that'll slowly transition into people becoming more and more degenerate, as we've seen in this market very closely. Moving on, we have Etherscan acquired Solscan. So soul scan is one of the more popular block explorers on Solana.
00:08:14.102 - 00:08:56.950, Speaker B: And of course, Etherscan is the block explorer for Ethereum and most of Ethereum or EVM related chains, and so everyone's super comfortable with using Etherscan. Soul scan isn't great, but it does sort of have a bit of the network effects. And so a lot of people are saying, all right, well, I know and love Etherscan. Now, they bought soul scan, so maybe I can actually, for once in my life, read a Solana block explorer. That's kind of interesting, because I've spent a lot of time in the salana data, and I've touched every single block explorer out there. I will say Salana FM recently released their latest block Explorer, which is a revamp from the first thing they had. It's called quantum, and it is ten out of ten.
00:08:56.950 - 00:09:29.314, Speaker B: That's my personal favorite block explorer. I do recommend you check it out if you're trying to understand salana transactions or something that happened on chain. But I will say, on the whole, Solana is just a completely different. Right. It's really is the EVM versus the SVM. It's just totally different. And so when you're going and using these block explorers, you can't just like, even though Etherscan acquired soul scan, maybe the UI looks a little friendlier or something you're familiar with, but understanding how the value moved through that transaction is truly just totally different.
00:09:29.314 - 00:09:35.810, Speaker B: So it does kind of take a new skill that just requires repetition. In the same way everybody learned how to use Etherscan.
00:09:36.870 - 00:10:18.740, Speaker C: I didn't realize that Etherscan was so well funded that they could actually do like an acquisition of sorts. I kind of thought, I know this is not really the case anymore, but Wikipedia back in the day was maybe going to shut down because they didn't have enough money, but now they just keep that donate or this is going to get shut down button there into perpetuity and they really are well funded. But yeah, I guess I just thought the ether scan was more of a public good. But looking back in hindsight, I'd be curious to see the amount of grants they've gotten from the optimism foundation and their retroactive public goods funding and other sorts of revenue that they've been able to bring in. Because aside from the API that's paid that they had, I just didn't know they had a sustainable long term business model. So that's pretty cool to see, actually.
00:10:19.670 - 00:10:38.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I've personally used the API and it works great. But again, I didn't really know. I know they charge like chains. Not too long ago, Avalanche was the one that pivoted off of the ether scan in favor of the route scan deployment built by. Oh gosh, I feel terrible. I'm blanking on their name. But it is Routescan.
00:10:38.610 - 00:11:11.570, Speaker B: Jack is, I think, the CEO over there. He's the man. So I think that was driven by the high cost to have an ether scan deployment. And Routescan is honestly a great deployment as well. I'm a fan of what that team has built with the new Avalanche Explorer, so would recommend checking that out. So it'll be interesting to see how that kind of goes forward. But nonetheless, moving on, we have Starknet community has voted yes to activate Starknet version zero point 13, which makes the Strk, the stark token, eligible as a gas token.
00:11:11.570 - 00:11:49.582, Speaker B: Surely this is like the first step in the path to launching the token and it'll be interesting to see if that actually goes live. But I personally have never used Starknet. I'm maybe outing myself a bit, but now there's so many damn l two s. It takes a dedicated effort to go explore a new chain and that's true. For every chain. So I've personally spent my time going to other new chains over in the cosmos using Solana and the different applications over there, that I've actually never made it over to Starknet. And also part of that is, along with ZK sync, it is so heavily farmed that it's like, all right, it's not even worth the personal time to try to go farm this myself.
00:11:49.582 - 00:11:58.020, Speaker B: I'd actually be going to use an interesting application over there, which is another problem for Starknet. So I'm curious if anyone has any counterarguments to that one.
00:11:59.590 - 00:12:13.640, Speaker A: I almost went over there and bought that al token when it was like 300k, but then I saw you had to set up a new wallet. I said maybe this weekend, and then it ran. So that's my starknet experience of not going over there.
00:12:14.570 - 00:13:18.860, Speaker D: I'm curious if any other chains, especially like major l two roll ups, are going to start allowing use of their own native token, whether that's like for arbitram or op for optimism. My gut feeling is no, because that complicates things, especially in terms of gas management. You need to have enough e on the contract on the l one to pay for whatever fees you pay as a roll up, and then you need to manage the arbor like Op. It just seems intuitively a lot easier to receive your revenue in ETH and also pay it out in ETH. But on the other hand, you could also make this argument that, for example, if you turn the gas token into your native token like ARB, then people may view it as better value accrual, because there's more like buying pressure, even though you would basically need to sell that for ETH in order to pay off the cost on the l one. So I think don't have strong opinion on this.
00:13:19.470 - 00:13:35.940, Speaker C: I think it helps give the token a form of money, and also an incentivization to provide deep liquidity on the l two for that native token. So I think there's a lot of benefits, even though underneath the hood it's literally the exact same thing as using ETH. It's just like a Ux and I guess like narrative thing.
00:13:36.870 - 00:14:43.270, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're going to see a lot more of this too, right? Because if you play out the rash driven roll up as a service driven launches that are coming on a long enough time horizon, not even that long, even in the next two quarters, we're going to have hundreds, if not thousands of more roll ups. And each of those will likely have their own token. And so now what if you're launching your own roll up, you have to make this Ux decision and this utility decision around your token. Is it just some pure pseudo equity token or is it some utility driven form of money or is it somewhere in the middle? And we haven't really seen l two s on the whole figure out what model is going to work. So I think it's a net positive if it's just an option to execute transactions, which it seems like this is the case, but if I was launching a new roll up today, I would absolutely not make the sole gas token my own token. That sounds like an absolute nightmare. Now if you have thousands of roll ups, you have thousands of tokens that you have to own and can't interact with.
00:14:43.270 - 00:15:18.546, Speaker B: And everybody's been stuck in that position where you send assets to a new chain because you're quickly trying to buy something or just trying to. Honestly, you're not even in a rush. And then you send your USDC there first or whatever, and now you don't have the gas token. Now you're like fuck, I got to run another transaction just to be able to use this thing. So I think it's a net positive if you're doing some sort of account abstraction model and it's just an additional gas token. But I'm pretty against it if it's just going to be the sole token. But I guess the real point there is l two s are going to have to figure out our roll ups on the whole are going to have to figure out what their token is trying to do.
00:15:18.546 - 00:16:01.246, Speaker B: In my personal view, I think we're going to see a very small number of tokens get this money like valuation where it's a bit of a head scratcher as to how it gets that valuation. It's more of like a commodity. It's very driven by demand and supply thinking bitcoin eth and then maybe either Solana or Tia. That's kind of the direction I see that going. And then you're going to get these l two s like say arbitram optimism or even some of the more modular ones like Eclipse or anything launching on a rasp provider. You're probably going to see a more pseudo equity token where maybe you're collecting profits from user transactions and redistributing those to users or something. That's kind of the direction I think about it.
00:16:01.246 - 00:16:10.580, Speaker B: But curious if you guys have any thoughts on what l two tokens or roll up tokens more generally should be how people should think about what those tokens do.
00:16:14.630 - 00:16:53.330, Speaker C: Personally speaking, I think they make a lot of sense to decentralize a sequencer set. I also would like to see more collaboration between the l two s native token and core developers and actual DAP developers. I think it would be cool if there's some perps protocol, let's say, and you stake the native token to get some yield, but then if you also have that l two s native token stake, then you get a boost. I just think that'd be a good way to align the two together. And considering you're going to be getting grants as a project in the native token, it makes sense to give value to that native token. So that way your incentives are worth more. But I think we're very much in innings one and two in the design space for l two tokens and bringing them utility.
00:16:54.390 - 00:17:41.674, Speaker D: I think tokens overall, I feel like this isn't that explored yet, but tokens should be seen sometimes as membership tokens, so to say. So I know we keep on having this running joke that if you have x amount of shares of Apple, you should be able to buy an iPhone at a y percent discount. Or if you own, I don't know, one share of Tesla, you should be put on the newest Tesla model like waitlist. And I kind of think that model makes a lot of sense whether you are like an l two or a dab. So some ways I see this potentially playing out. I'm not sure how possible it is actually. But you stake a certain number of Arp tokens or op tokens, and if you hit a certain threshold you get like a 10% fee discount.
00:17:41.674 - 00:18:08.630, Speaker D: If you hit the next threshold you get like a 20% fee discount. And if you hit like the crazy Vip mega whale threshold you get like a 50% discount. And obviously someone will have to run the numbers and make sure that the l two itself remains net profitable. But I do think people should start thinking about that. And I agree with Sam that just like decentralizing a sequencer set is probably like the next large utility of l two token beyond governance.
00:18:09.210 - 00:18:31.546, Speaker B: Yeah ren, I think those are great points as well. And speaking of tokens, we have two more airdrops that have been announced. First was the Manta airdrop. So manta is a roll up built through. Caldera is a roll up as a service provider or a Ras provider. And they are using the op stack as well. And so they just announced their token airdrop and that will be going to Tia stakers.
00:18:31.546 - 00:18:58.470, Speaker B: Tia stakers are consistently winning here. I don't know if this is almost like a self fulfilling prophecy of Tia stakers getting these airdrops like crypto. Twitter really spoke this one into existence, which is pretty funny to see. And the other one we heard was the Xi or Xai airdrop, which is an arbitram orbit train. And this one will be claimable on Tuesday. So this is a pretty hyped gaming specific chain. Sam, I know you were pretty excited about this one, so can you shed some extra light on Zai?
00:19:00.090 - 00:19:31.806, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. It's just an arbitram orbit l three, and I think they're actually dabbling in some parallel processing now. I know it's like a really early stage product, and they basically did like a sentry node sale because they're really trying to lean into the decentralized validator set type deal. And those keys are going for ten x what they were initially on the node sale. So very hyped project. I know a lot of people on our team have been looking at it a lot closer than I have. I think arbitrum makes a lot of sense, especially as an l three for a gaming ecosystem, considering the amount of liquidity and users there.
00:19:31.806 - 00:19:41.960, Speaker C: But, yeah, you know how gaming is. It takes a lot of time to build out a good game. And I know all of us are still waiting for that first killer game that we all want to play every day and get super lost in.
00:19:42.730 - 00:20:08.766, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a lot to be excited about on the gaming front. We're still so early would give a self plug to our episode with Scott Sonardo, the co founder of Argus. That is a phenomenal episode. Really gives a good overview of what they're building and why it's relevant for people building crypto games. But maybe we move on to a segment of hot seat. Cool throne. Let's go, Ren, I'll throw things over to you first, man.
00:20:08.766 - 00:20:09.680, Speaker B: What do you got?
00:20:10.050 - 00:20:43.558, Speaker D: Sure, I have a hot seat this week. It's lrt mania. I feel like every day I log on to Twitter, I see a new restaking protocol with some new version of points programs. And I wouldn't say I have any gripes. It's just like the market doing market things, people giving what people want, especially in terms of point. But it seems like no one really has a clear idea of the risk around lrts and sort of restaking as a whole. And no one really has figured out composability.
00:20:43.558 - 00:21:35.914, Speaker D: Right. Just looking off this list, there's like Renzo protocol, there's kelp dow, there's erdo fi, there's restake finance, there's power finance, there's Rio network, and there's probably like a few more that I'm missing. It's just a lot of LH protocols. Each of them have their own liquid restaking token, and each one of these liquid restaking tokens has a different node operator set or is helping to validate different Abs. And so you reach this point where each LRT represents different level of risk, and thus theoretically each LRT should be priced differently. And then you need to start thinking about liquidity for these lrts on decentralized exchanges. Whereas if you compare that to liquid staking tokens, right, those are pretty easy to compare because they're only really doing one thing.
00:21:35.914 - 00:22:28.022, Speaker D: They're helping to secure the core ethereum protocol to the proof of stake chain, whereas for these lrts right now, they're technically not even doing anything, whether that's natively restaked in eigen layer or any LST that's staked in eigen layers. They're not securing anything because Abs aren't live, Eigen Da isn't live, so they're just like sitting there. But they're proving points though. But it just feels like a really messy situation. I feel like at some point we're going to need an l two beat for lrts just to disclose every single risk, whether that's like slashing risk or node operator risk around a specific LRT token you're holding. And I think at some point, I don't want to say this is going to implode, but it's going to reach like a serious tipping point, right? Something's going to happen. There's going to be a lot of drama on the timeline.
00:22:28.022 - 00:23:10.490, Speaker D: The slashing company is going to have to make probably the largest social consensus decision that Ethereum has ever seen. Whether that's, I don't know, like a bridge blowing up, or like an oracle doing something wacky. To be honest, I don't have a good solution. Launching like an LRT protocol is just like something that was very obvious and you know would be coming. And it's kind of like the early Aum wars of the ETF. Like, before the ETF is launched, everyone wants to line up the Aum to be like the go to player. And there's obvious network effects that come into play once you have a larger LRT, especially in terms of whether that's incentives or Dex liquidity.
00:23:10.490 - 00:23:22.640, Speaker D: But yeah, people should probably start thinking about risk trenching what exposure you have to while holding your LRT. But don't just ape into it for the points.
00:23:23.730 - 00:24:00.914, Speaker B: Yeah, it was Will Sheehan. He's the founder of Parsec Finance. It's a great data driven platform for on chain data. And he had a great tweet the other day that was like something to the effect of permissionless markets are going to be permissionless and people are going to build things whether you want them to or not. The point being that blockchains, the superpower of blockchains, is quite simple. It's transparency. You can now see where the risk is building up in the system and have that be a factor in your decision making process on whether or not you participate in this ecosystem.
00:24:00.914 - 00:24:52.854, Speaker B: Right. This is probably a really silly comparison, but just bear with me for a second. So, housing crisis of 2008, there weren't that many people that knew this was becoming a problem until after the problem had exploded. But if you kind of map that same logic onto just adding leverage into the system for eigen layer and this restaking narrative, then at least you can see and measure the risk in real time. Of course, we don't really know what those risk boundaries are like. At what point are we in the extreme danger zone? Right? That's kind of a touch and feel thing, rather than being able to, because we haven't experienced something like this before. For me, I'm still honestly a little bit confused on what risks Eigen layer poses.
00:24:52.854 - 00:25:36.710, Speaker B: Right? Like, okay, so the mass slashing events seem, surface level, very dangerous, but I don't get how that, like, let's say there's a mass slashing event on Eigen layer. How does that end up impacting ethereum? Because to me that would be where the issues. I hope you. Can you provide any unpacking on this question? Because to me it would be like the other way around. So these lsts have eth secured by validators on chain. If there was a mass slashing event on the Ethereum base layer, then I see how the risk would flow upstream, because now all of these tokens that are securing things are all of a sudden less valuable, and so you have less security. And I could see the issue flowing upstream, but I don't really get how it flow back downstream to ethereum.
00:25:36.710 - 00:25:47.580, Speaker B: I'd never admittedly read Vitalik's like, don't over leverage Ethereum consensus post, but I would guess the answer is awaiting for me in there. Rand, do you have any clarity on that?
00:25:48.910 - 00:27:06.598, Speaker D: I would say that I don't have a huge amount of clarity to end whatever I say. Next piece, double check my answer. But for example, if a slashing event occurs on icon layer, realistically for the next one or two years, the first thing that will happen is whether the slashing committee decides that they want to sort of go ahead with this slashing. I think the slashing committee is formed of twelve individuals, and they have the power to vettle any sashing and basically say, okay, this slashing isn't happening, just we go back to normal. But for example, if a stashing did occur, right, and say it was specific for one abs, then theoretically, either like the native Eve that's been restaked into Eigen layer or the lsts, those withdrawal keys, it's not actually stashed in a sense of ethereum stashing, where it's burned and just disappears off the face of the earth. It's more so that someone basically holds access to that underlying ETH and they're able to, if they wanted to, burn it. But if not, for example, they could take it, redeem the LST and use that as compensation for an attack that occurred on their middleware protocol, for example.
00:27:06.598 - 00:27:39.470, Speaker D: Right? So technically it's not like the amount of Eve securing the base layer of ethereum disappears. It's not burned. But theoretically it should be taken away from the amount of Eve. That's basically securing Ethereum as a base layer, if that makes sense. So either way, if a stashing event happens, I do think it quote unquote, decreases the amount of economic security of Ethereum.
00:27:40.370 - 00:27:43.130, Speaker B: A slashing event on eigenve.
00:27:43.210 - 00:28:31.646, Speaker D: Okay, yeah, it does theoretically decrease the economic security of Eve. That's like securing Ethereum. But I also think you see a world where it's possible that there's a lot of people that have exposure to LRT, and that's not securing Ethereum, but you are just securing like eigenve or abs. I'm not sure what that breakdown looks like. It's all a bit messy, to be honest. But if you ask anybody today that's like a normal crypto participant, how do you define risk? Or how do you define the amount of leverage in the system from eigen layer? Right. I don't think anyone has a good answer, and I think someone should probably start working on a transparent way to track that.
00:28:31.646 - 00:28:45.220, Speaker D: I'm sure there's researchers working on that question right now, but just like a transparent way for normies to understand that question would also be really good, because no one has any clue what's going on realistically right now.
00:28:45.590 - 00:29:18.670, Speaker B: I definitely agree with you that transparency is only valuable if we know how to interpret the data that we're looking at. And that's a bit of an unanswered question. So who knows? Maybe we'll spend our time doing that. But I'm going to throw another curveball at you. So if I'm a solo staker and I solo stake and restake through Eigen layer, I know I have to essentially deposit my withdrawal key to Eigen layer. Where do those keys go? And what happens if I get fully, like, do they just burn the withdrawal keys?
00:29:19.330 - 00:29:22.282, Speaker D: If you get footy slash on Eigenair or Ethereum?
00:29:22.346 - 00:29:22.960, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:29.830 - 00:30:16.642, Speaker D: If you get slashed on Eigen layer as like a solo staker. So you're basically giving the withdrawal credentials and pointing that to the eigenair contract. I don't think you have to because there's like partial withdrawals and there's full withdrawals. So I'm not sure how it works. If you get, say like ten e, would you just have to withdraw that? Okay, say you're a solo staker, you have 32 e, which is like the sort of like the minimum balance for an Ethereum validator today. You restake that into icon layer by pointing or withdrawing credentials to the icon layer contract. And some stashing event happens for ten e, right? I don't think you can withdraw ten e as like an ethereum validator today.
00:30:16.642 - 00:30:28.790, Speaker D: It's either like all or nothing. And either way, if you withdraw ten e, your balance goes from 32 e to 22 e, and you wouldn't be an Ethereum validator anymore because there's a 32 e minimum.
00:30:29.130 - 00:30:44.810, Speaker B: Right. But I think what would happen is, let's say I got slashed for ten eth as the validator. Then when I go to withdraw, the 32 eth would move from the beacon chain to the Eigen layer. Smart. Contract on Ethereum, and then I would only get 22 back.
00:30:44.960 - 00:30:55.614, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's what would happen. And Eigen layer would keep the ten to do whatever they want with it, whether that's like compensating an abs for something that went wrong or anything else.
00:30:55.732 - 00:31:24.178, Speaker B: But in the example of the full slash, right, then I am running a box in my basement that is validating the chain that is still an active validator even though I've been slashed and is now worthless to me. So doesn't that create, like, I don't know, if they instantly withdraw, kick you from the queue, from the active set if you get slashed, because they do own the withdrawal keys. So theoretically you get full slashed and then immediately get ejected.
00:31:24.274 - 00:31:25.078, Speaker D: Got you.
00:31:25.244 - 00:31:30.634, Speaker B: I don't know what that looks like, but that seems like a problem. I'm sure they've definitely thought about this. We just don't know the answer.
00:31:30.752 - 00:31:46.240, Speaker D: Yeah, I've definitely read something about this before, like how does the core Ethereum protocol know that a slashing event occurred on Eigen layer? And there's definitely an answer for this. I just cannot remember it off the top of my head.
00:31:48.130 - 00:32:22.890, Speaker C: And on top of all of that stuff that you guys just talked about, which is much more technical. I'm honestly concerned about just pegs. I mean, even during May of 2022, if I'm remembering my dates correctly, when FTX and everything and st E D pegged, that thing went down to like $0.88. If you're taking a derivative on top of a restaked LST, that could get ugly pretty quickly. And I think that's the most probable outcome for just in terms of poor UX and something people are more likely to run into. I think that these pegs are going to be pretty tough to maintain.
00:32:23.470 - 00:33:14.906, Speaker D: I'll double down on what Sam mentioned there. I think the looped leverage like stake deep trade, where you just loop stake deep on AAve or some other lending market infinitely didn't really exist last cycle. And I guarantee you that if an LRT has significant network effects or significant amount of liquidity, then a money market will list it. And at some point we're going to tough for this market cycle and everyone's going to want to sell back their e for USDC and all of those staked e for leverage loop like whatever. All of that's going to need to be unwinded or unwound. And there's just not going to be enough liquidity on chain. And I think we're going to see this black swan event at some point where pegs go pretty disgustingly low.
00:33:14.906 - 00:34:01.926, Speaker D: I think they recover pretty fast. But I do think at some point there'll be a pretty big debegging event, probably towards the later stage of the market cycle near the top. Also, I think another thing with Eigen layer is that fees, right? You have maybe your node operated charging fees, and maybe Eigen layer is going to charge fees and then your LRT protocol is going to charge fees. At some point it's probably going to add up to like 15% on all of the rewards. And I feel like there's probably not going to be a lot of transparency around those fees too. So there's a lot of open questions. Node operators are going to need to choose what abs to run stakers are going to have to choose how to measure their yield.
00:34:01.926 - 00:34:49.260, Speaker D: Do they want it in us dollar basis, or do they want to compare everything to Eth? Igonet is going to support duo token staking, so maybe some node operators are going to have to restake ETH. And also the native token and operators, for example, are going to run into their own challenges where they may need to charge higher fees depending on the complexity of the ABS that they choose to participate in, right? So say like, one ABS has like a crazy high validator hardware requirement that requires ten extra opex, right? Whereas another abs has like a normal amount of opex. How do you select a generic fee for your LRT? There's just like a lot of questions that remain to be answered. I'm sure the answers are out there, but not a lot of people have a good idea.
00:34:51.790 - 00:35:29.702, Speaker B: Yeah, and that could honestly be an interesting top signal for the upcoming cycle. It'll probably be a late one, and one you wish you knew before it happened, but an eigen layer like abs blow up or huge slashing event or restaking drama is probably something we see at the top of the cycle. What's up everyone? March is approaching fast, and I want to give you another reminder not to miss out on Das London. It is coming, it's right around the corner, and it's in March. From the 18th through the 20th, we have three full days of content. This is your chance to bump shoulders with some of the world's top executives and have open dialogue with both attendees and speakers. We're going to be focusing on a range of topics that I'll let Ren discuss for you.
00:35:29.756 - 00:36:06.510, Speaker D: First on the list we have bitcoin, catalyst, the halving and spot ETF. Next we have a view from the buy side from investors on things like strategy, portfolio allocation, and more. We also have a topic on RWAS, tokenization and stablecoins, which I think we can all agree are going to pay large role in crypto's future. We'll also talk about global regulatory frameworks like compliance, best practices, and the evolution of global standards that are shaping the global investment landscape. We'll also have someone from the institutional front to talk about infrastructure such as banking and payments, with financial giants like Visa and JPMorgan. And last on the list, the macro case for digital assets. So don't miss out on this monumental event.
00:36:06.510 - 00:36:15.582, Speaker D: Seats are limited, so be sure to register today by hitting the link in the description and using the promo code zero x ten to save 10% on tickets. See you in London.
00:36:15.646 - 00:36:18.760, Speaker B: But zero x pibbles, who you got in the hot seat or cool throne this week?
00:36:19.530 - 00:37:13.426, Speaker A: Yeah, so far away from the tech that's been in the hot seat. I'm talking about node monkeys as the cool throne and it is very simple depictelated monkey picture. They did super well over the past two weeks. It was a super nice minting experience, but they've done about 45 million volume in two weeks and floor peaked around like twelve k per monkey. They're sitting like ten k per monkey now. But I think it's a really cool experiment on bitcoin to see if we're going to start seeing high value nfts migrating to bitcoin over Ethereum, like how Ethereum had crypto punks. I could see something like node monkeys, or maybe it's the frogs being the actual blue chip Nft of this cycle.
00:37:13.426 - 00:38:03.126, Speaker A: And my cat just screamed in the. The one of the co founders of Yuga Labs bought a monkey and posted it right after he tweeted about it. They just started ripping some more. And it's funny because the history of node monkeys was not great, so they inscribed the monkeys between the sat range in February of 2023. They didn't launch till December because they wanted the infrastructure to get built out a lot better because it was freaking awful to do anything on bitcoin back then. So it was originally supposed to be a free mint. And then they claimed that someone offered them 5 million seed funding and they denied it.
00:38:03.126 - 00:38:42.820, Speaker A: And they're like, no, it's a free mint. And they're like, wait, we're going to do a paid mint and we're going to donate everything to charity? And then they went back on that too. And then they did a pavement, that's a dutch auction. And they gave like a percentage to charity, I think. I'm not really sure. But overall, node monkeys being the most successful profile picture on bitcoin is a super interesting way to start off the year, especially with the ETF coming in. And I'm really excited to see how the bitcoin NFT ecosystem, ordinal ecosystem continues to grow throughout the year.
00:38:44.150 - 00:38:55.430, Speaker B: You mentioned it was a super smooth, I think it was a dutch auction. Can you talk just a bit about what that looked like? And how does that work on bitcoin, considering there's no smart contracts?
00:38:56.170 - 00:39:35.826, Speaker A: Yeah, so it was like a highly centralized dutch auction, but it started at maybe like 0.8 bitcoin or one. Bitcoin was like the starting price and it would decline every few blocks. And once you paid whatever the closing price of the monkeys when they sold out was, that's the price that you got anything over was refunded to your wallet. So it was all done by the node monkeys team. So if you bid at the very beginning, they cleared at a price of like 0.3 bitcoin, then they would give you whatever you got worth, or whatever bitcoin you put in.
00:39:35.826 - 00:40:11.390, Speaker A: You'd get them any nfts, and if there was like an OD number out, they would just refund it to you. But this was super good for bitcoin because the transactions are so slow, and it kept it from being like a spammed or gamed mint, where just a bunch of bots set up and spiked the ordinal fee really high and just ruined the minting experience in the distribution. So because of the dutch auction method that they used, I think it really helped the overall mechanics of node monkeys on secondary markets.
00:40:11.810 - 00:41:14.498, Speaker D: I do think that there's something to be said, at least from a perception perspective, of nfts on bitcoin. Just because bitcoin is seen as a limited supply token and you think about nfts on bitcoin, then you perceive them as even more limited. It's really hard to inscribe an NFT on bitcoin, especially one with an earlier set. And I think that kind of shows in the minor revenue, right? If you take a look at our bitcoin dashboard on our fantastic analytics product, minor revenue from total transaction fees has hit a monthly all time high. It's hit a high of 336.1 million in fees, compared to the previous all time high of 251.4%. And most importantly, if you look at the percentage breakdown in minor revenue, right, in the month of December, transaction fees made up roughly 21.5%
00:41:14.498 - 00:41:54.134, Speaker D: of minor revenue, whereas in the previous all time high, that was only 14.7% of total minor revenue. And now ordinals make up 5.7% of minor revenue. And just like, at least on WeChat, it seems like China is pretty heavily invested in the bitcoin and ordinal ecosystem. You're seeing a lot of vcs investing in ordinal's infrastructure, whether that's amms or sort of like lending protocols or just like projects. It really seems like this is a personal thesis, but I feel like it's like a bitcoin miner super cycle.
00:41:54.134 - 00:42:29.180, Speaker D: Whereas for a sustained period of time, you are going to see a very significant amount of transaction fees generated on bitcoin. Right? For example, in December, I think bitcoin generated more transaction fees than Ethereum by quite a large amount, and I would not be surprised if there were a few months where that also happened again in 2024. And I don't think a lot of people are pricing that in. If you look at one of those ecosystem maps of bitcoin, l two s ordinals, inscriptions, whatever that has exploded in the past few months.
00:42:30.050 - 00:43:05.350, Speaker A: Yeah, and an interesting data point there is. The price to inscribe inscriptions is just going to keep going up and to inscribe 10,000 profile pictures now I saw stat and was like it would cost upwards of like $5 million to create a collection that big. So there's like historical significance of being part of the first hundred k inscriptions back when it was affordable. And it's going to place a limit on is it worthwhile for me to try to launch an inscription collection?
00:43:06.650 - 00:43:47.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that takeaway right there is super bullish. Something that I actually mentioned that like a month ago or something when I was thinking they were talking about ocean mining, I guess censoring out some ordinal transactions, and I was like, well then I guess maybe it's bullish because you won't be able to inscribe anymore, but this is like the same effect. So I totally agree with you, pibbles, and I think that's maybe a reason why ud and a couple of the others who are behind Taproot wizards actually raised some money. I think maybe they had to inscribe in a more high fee environment than some of these earlier collections that reserved their inscription spots before the craze, actually. So I think that's something we'll see more of like NFT projects and communities raising to launch, project and inscribe on bitcoin.
00:43:49.770 - 00:44:33.630, Speaker B: Two more bullish things while we're at it. ETF is just net positive for all of bitcoin as a whole, and the happening is in about 96 days. I mean, it's really hard not to be very excited about this year as a whole. Renna, I love the stats you brought there. I was trying to share, screen and walk the viewers through, but if you're listening to this podcast, that was another great way to kind of get that information. It's really insane to see the growth in what these transaction fees are actually doing to benefit the miners and honestly the long term sustainability of this chain. I am really excited to see this new era spur further innovation for bitcoin.
00:44:33.630 - 00:44:53.450, Speaker B: I personally don't think that ordinals are the be all, end all, but I think what it's the most exciting thing that it's doing is actually bringing the idea of innovation back to crypto. And I think you're going to see the era of l two s kind of come back, and I guess that kind of segues pretty nicely. Sam, into your hot seat cool throne.
00:44:55.230 - 00:45:30.114, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm stealing a little bit of effort capital's thunder here. He tweeted the other day about stacks, but I've got STX in the cool throne. It's up 100%. Over the past 30 days, I have been publicly skeptical of stacks at a technical level, but ignoring all of that, I think it's a very good trade. I mean, l two tokens on Eth have done very well. And you get that l two narrative exposure plus the rise of ordinals and BRC twenty s, and then you've got just bitcoin and the ETF at large as a huge narrative. And then at the same time, if it's like an altcoin season, I think STX kind of classifies as an alt as well.
00:45:30.114 - 00:46:12.606, Speaker C: So I think you kind of get the best of both worlds there. And back to what I was saying about what effort pointed out on Twitter, you've got three and a half billion fdv for STX versus 15 billion plus for ARB and op. So it does seem like a little bit of a narrative violation, in my opinion. And if you download any ordinals wallet, like you've got x first and leather, which was formerly hero, a lot of them have native stack support for STX stacking and certain dapps within that ecosystem that you can access. So I think that could be a tailwind. Just if people download Nornol's wallet and are dabbling there and then see STX price going up, and then they're like, yeah, maybe I'll throw $500 here, see how stacking works, and see that yield, and then start using different apps. I think that's pretty promising.
00:46:12.606 - 00:46:46.174, Speaker C: And then obviously, we have the Nakamoto upgrade coming up, which is going to introduce faster block times for stacks and hopefully less reorgs, as well as an S bitcoin derivative. I guess if I would say, like another bold take for 2024, I think that bitcoin related l two s will be the most value hacked in all of crypto, to be honest. It's simply just not secure. And there's inherent trust assumptions that comes along with it. So definitely be careful with some of them. But that's not to say there's not going to be a ton of money made on bitcoin l two s this cycle. I'm very sure about that.
00:46:46.174 - 00:46:54.450, Speaker C: But yeah, I think STX is really just the only way to get bitcoin l two exposure, if you will. So I think it's a solid trade.
00:46:55.350 - 00:47:14.280, Speaker A: I think it would feel terrible to watch your bitcoin app get exploited on the bitcoin block explorer because you're sitting there watching in this 20 minutes eternity long transaction like, damn, all my money is disappearing in here. There's nothing I can do to stop it.
00:47:15.050 - 00:48:11.046, Speaker B: Counterpoint as a developer, you get ten minute gaps to try to stop the next exploit. But then again, I guess on like an l two, you could still get rugged on something native to an l two at a much quicker rate. But it'll be interesting to see what comes of this because I'm admittedly not as caught up as I'd like to be on the bitcoin l two side of things. But my understanding is you can't really get the type. You need an opcode change to really bring true l two s to bitcoin, and the OG maxis are just going to stand in the way of that. So I think we're probably going to get a block size wars v two based around like can we support l two s? Unless somebody comes in and figures out a new way of getting a real trustworthy l two or trustless l two onto bitcoin. And that, I don't know.
00:48:11.046 - 00:48:31.066, Speaker B: I need to get more culture into the bitcoin to l two side of things. I personally wrote it off because I came to crypto because I thought smart contracts were just super interesting and not having that functionality was what just made me spend attention elsewhere. But yeah, I don't know. It'll be interesting to see if this can turn from a narrative to reality.
00:48:31.258 - 00:49:16.160, Speaker D: I do think bitcoin ux still has an insane amount of work to do. I think that thread between udi and someone else, like trying to pay his invoice, was the funniest thing I've read in quite some time. Just like the amount of pain that he had to go through to get one simple invoice paid. But I do think it gets better over the cycle, and I don't think bitcoin is going to have a thriving defi ecosystem in the long run. And if anything, you could say how much of a pain bitcoin is today, if anything, could be quite bullish, especially for NFTs because it means people are lazy. It's hard to yeah.
00:49:18.050 - 00:49:43.778, Speaker C: I agree with you. And that is lightning specific. Like that Eric wall thread that you're talking. So like, I think he's super bullish on the idea of scaling know eventually and he's kind of behind the taproot wizards movement. But I think he was just pointing out lightning is simply a failed project. We need to stop spending development resources around bitcoin on supporting this movement because it simply doesn't work. But I definitely agree with you Brad.
00:49:43.778 - 00:50:10.650, Speaker C: And then I guess a counterpoint to my hacks thesis would be I don't really know where you would go with just native bitcoin had you hacked a bridge to an l two or something like that. Most of the time in Ethereum you've got tornado cash or some other app. Just a bunch of different idiosyncrasies and things you can do with it to make it harder to track. Like with bitcoin, you're literally just stuck in a Utxo and I don't know what you would do with that. So maybe that's bullish.
00:50:10.730 - 00:50:56.510, Speaker B: Dormant bitcoin supply well, recent trends would indicate that you'd take it through thorchain, back to Ethereum and then go do something with it. But in that case we see the opposite, where exploit on Ethereum use Thor chain to get to bitcoin where you can wash it through mixers. Presumably you'd take those mixers onto the now mixed bitcoin into a sex. And then either I have no idea if we tend to see those outflows to go into dollars, or if once you're in a sex, then you flip into bitcoin from bitcoin back into ETH, and then you take your EtH back on chain. I have no idea what that looks like, but unfortunately Thorchain has historically played a fairly key role in moving between those two ecosystems.
00:50:58.690 - 00:51:16.900, Speaker C: That makes sense. Actually, I did not think about that. I'd be surprised if a bitcoin mixer, specifically like a peer to peer mixer, would be able to handle the capacity of a large hack. But yeah, Thor chain obviously has the liquidity and the volume to support quite a bit.
00:51:17.530 - 00:51:47.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know shit about the bitcoin mixers. I presume they're pretty good because for whatever reason we tend to see hacks move to bitcoin. And through those mixers, I would assume that they're like a centralized entity that kind of plays that role. So you're taking that risk if you're the exploiter. But then again, if you lose half your stolen funds, you still have half the stolen funds. So I don't know. I don't know enough about security to make smart opinions here.
00:51:47.280 - 00:52:14.834, Speaker B: So maybe that's a good point to get off of this conversation. And I'll jump to my hot sequel, Throne, which I spent a lot of time in this Celestia data. Over the past couple of weeks, I built out a dashboard for blockers research users. We'll go ahead and show it here. I'll share screen and add it to this stream for the viewers rather than the listeners. But I'll, of course, talk through this as we go through it as well. I really don't know if it's a hot seat or a cool throne.
00:52:14.834 - 00:53:15.222, Speaker B: I'm still out on it. Everything in my body wants it to be a cool throne, but I'm struggling, so I'll walk through it. So Celestia is a purpose built blockchain specifically to be a data availability layer, or essentially to allow other chains to post their data onto Celestia for very, very cheap. So whereas Ethereum is very expensive, but the largest DA layer, Celestia is trying to basically undercut the market and make a significantly cheaper place for roll ups to post data to, which ultimately allows them to scale. So in the l two or the roll up fee model, the user pays the amount it costs to settle that transact or to post that transaction for DA, plus some additional execution based fee. And so the cost that comes back to the rope to actually post that gets passed directly to the user. So that really is like a variable cost in what ultimately increases the transaction fees to users.
00:53:15.222 - 00:53:56.822, Speaker B: The execution side of things, you can have a little more customization around, and there's different implementations you could use to get that lower. So Celestia is really focused on cutting down the first half of that cost structure for users, and Celestia is able to do this through what's called, like, data availability sampling. I am not going to give an attempt to explain that in depth. It's really honestly something that should be used for a whole podcast. And we've actually had Nick White on our show before, and he's done a phenomenal job explaining that vision. And that's probably the two of the biggest powerpoints for Celestia, is the strength of the team and the pursuit of a single vision. They've really created the modular thesis as a whole, and now that's all anybody will talk about.
00:53:56.822 - 00:54:45.106, Speaker B: So I really am excited about the team and the direction that they're pushing. So if we get into a little bit of the data Ethereum sees about 700 megabytes of data get posted to it per day by somewhere between 15 or so roll ups. Some of those are much larger than the other ones, with the most data rich roll ups being linear. Surprisingly, zksync, arbitrum, and op mainnet, in no particular order, those are just, I believe, the top four. And so for a context like a single roll up, like arbitrum per se, it posts about 120 megabytes of data per day. And so right now on Celestia, we're seeing three active namespaces, which are effectively the location where you would post your data. So you get like your own dedicated namespace.
00:54:45.106 - 00:55:24.318, Speaker B: I could call my role posting to Daniel's namespace, right, or whatever I want. And so you'll see the namespaces here. Some are just hex encoded strings, while others are plain text, like astroglyph is an inscriptions protocol. Astroglyph actually for the longest time was the most posted to data in terms of megabytes, and I'm just realizing that manta network and actual role has now flipped that. So that's kind of good to see. And so we've only seen meaningful activity from about four namespaces. We don't know what this 2410 is, or this 8080-8080 because they elected to not use a plain text namespace.
00:55:24.318 - 00:55:49.094, Speaker B: So this is a plead to all developers to not hate data and allow us to know what you're doing. I've confirmed this with the manta team that this is indeed their namespace. That's the only reason. I know it's manta. But manta network would have sufficed as a namespace. I'm just saying. But nonetheless, we've only really seen adoption from about four roll ups or protocols in general, and you'll notice that they've paid pretty varying fees.
00:55:49.094 - 00:56:32.042, Speaker B: So for 400 megabytes of data, mantis paid 101 Tia, whereas astroglyphs posted not much less at 340 megabytes, but only six TiA, which is a massive discrepancy. It turns out that because of Celestia's fee model, it's a first price auction. So think Ethereum before EIP 1559 was implemented, and the base fee gave you this one number to pay to get in the block. Tia is very much so. You take every transaction in the mem pool, you rank, sort them on fees, and whoever fits in the block gets in the block. And so what that does is it creates the inefficiency for a bidding war if the block is to be full. And even in the case of no bidding war, you can overpay, and that's like perfectly possible.
00:56:32.042 - 00:57:01.394, Speaker B: And Manta unfortunately appears to be doing that. They're paying about eleven or twelve times too high of a fee. And so I don't know if that kind of comes out in caldera, which is the role as a service provider who they kind of built through. I don't know if it's an issue on Caldera's end. I don't know if that's an issue on Manta's end or somewhere in between. But it is interesting to see how that's kind of played out. And so right now we're seeing about 30 to 50 megabytes of data get posted per day.
00:57:01.394 - 00:57:56.238, Speaker B: And again, for context, Ethereum sees about 700. And it's kind of when EIP, what is it, 4844, which is like the protodang sharding EiP. When that goes live, Ethereum will then support a max of 5400 megabytes per day. And to compare that to Celestia, who is again, kind of built around this idea of abundance rather than scarcity, Celestia offers today 46,080 megabytes per day. So again, even after EIP 4844 goes live, Celestia is about ten times more available or has more data availability, service or space or bandwidth than Ethereum does. So that ultimately allows Celestia to be dirt cheap. Even though Manta is paying like ten x eleven x too much for their fees, it is still insanely cheaper.
00:57:56.238 - 00:59:07.190, Speaker B: I'm talking 99% cheaper to post to Celestia than it is to post to Ethereum main net today. And so when Ef 4844 goes live, there's going to be a meaningful transaction cost reduction, but it is not 99%. 99% gets you to a point where you can get subsent transactions for roll ups, and that is ultimately going to be a massive driver for adoption. When roll ups do come live, this is where I kind of start to become skeptical of how sustainable is this demand going to be? Because what Celestia has absolutely nailed and just done so so right is integrate with rope as a service providers or places that you allow to one click deploy a new chain. So they're integrated with Astria, dimension, conduit and caldera that I can name off the top of my head. They also have the ability to, if you launch through an arbitram orbit, train the op stack or a polygon SDK chain or, sorry, CDK chain, you can launch on Celestia if you want a sovereign roll up. I think these are still pretty actively in development, but roll kit and the sovereign SDK can both be built using Celestia.
00:59:07.190 - 00:59:38.166, Speaker B: And then even more custom rollups can still also build their own implementation for Celestia. So something like Argus or Eclipse, that is a lot of different ways to build something that ends up posting data onto Celestia. And I've poked around with some of the rollups that these roll up as a service providers are enabling. And I'm going to be completely honest, they look like, terrible. There's nothing net new. It is just like building an app for the sake of building an app. And now this time, instead of it being a set of smart contracts, it's a roll up because it's really easy to do and that's great.
00:59:38.166 - 01:00:27.700, Speaker B: But I don't necessarily consider that really sustainable demand. And Celestia needs a ton of demand. So for them to max out their current bandwidth of about 46,000 megabytes per day, they need about 65 times the amount of data getting posted to it than ethereum sees today. And I'm not saying that's impossible, but I am questioning where that demand is going to come from. Is it high TPS general purpose chains? Is it like an army of app specific roll ups that we're kind of seeing through these rasp providers? Does some of those actually get users and adoption and continued use? Is it going to be gaming focused chains? That's kind of where my head's at, is. It'll probably be the combination of high throughput chains that can just be the best roll ups today. And a lot of that roll up activity shifts to these chains because it's cheaper and more things can be done there.
01:00:27.700 - 01:01:16.494, Speaker B: And then gaming, I think, makes a lot of sense because gaming seems to be a good fit for roll apps. Right? Like, if I'm building a decentralized exchange, a roll app doesn't do me any good because I need to be where my liquidity is. And that's not a problem you have with something like gaming, where you know what? I want my own environment, I don't want the noisy neighbor problem, and I don't need composability. So gaming kind of seems like it's a potential fit here, but it is interesting to see. So even if you play this out on a long enough time horizon, say that it does get that 65 x Ethereum's current data activity. All right, well, now we're maxing out our current block size, which can be scaled, but let's just take that out of the equation for now, at 46,000 megabytes per day, the fees are still quite small. I would say they're around $5 million per day annualized.
01:01:16.494 - 01:01:55.998, Speaker B: Excuse me. If you hit 46,000 megabytes per day, the chain generates about 5 million in fees. 5 million is just simply not enough to justify the current valuation of 1314 15 billion. So that's where you start to kind of struggle, like, okay, the fees kind of starts to break down over the long enough time horizon, but will there be external demand for this token? They're really trying to push the idea of using tia to bootstrap your roll ups and getting this token into the ecosystem and into the hands of. And like, that is something that materially could play out. And I wouldn't necessarily bet against. The idea of modular money I think is super valuable for the cosmos ecosystem as a whole.
01:01:55.998 - 01:02:36.974, Speaker B: That's something they've been trying to do with Adam hasn't really panned out. So Tia's kind of like round two at know you're already seeing material demand for the token through this airdrop narrative that is playing out in real time, as we mentioned at the beginning of this episode. So I am definitely intrigued and excited about Celestia. There's just nothing that I can point to right now that is like, oh, this will be the definitive source of demand for da going forward. Now, that's not to say that just because I can't point to it right now, I think it's a failed project or something crazy like that. That is not what I'm saying at all. I'm really glad that we have this dashboard available to watch the growth in real time and see what drives it.
01:02:36.974 - 01:03:00.178, Speaker B: Because if we do see gaming coming in and just posting a shit ton of data, it might, and then that'd be great to have that data point and then be like, okay, no gaming. I do believe in gaming as a whole long term, and I do think it makes sense to bring some of that on chain. So that would be, like, a very strong indicator to me that this actually might work out. So I know I've rambled a lot, but I'm curious if you guys have any thoughts on Celestio or its viability.
01:03:00.354 - 01:04:31.230, Speaker D: I think just a few random thoughts. I've never really thought about this question, but how much economic security does a data availability layer need? It's hard to quantify. I'm not sure if I have any framework for it at all. But say, if you had to put a number to it, it would be less than the amount of economic security that ethereum, the base protocol has, right? And you could make an argument for, given the amount of economic security that Celestia provides, which of course is highly, highly dependent on the price of celestia, then maybe Celestia isn't charging enough for people to post their data to celestia, even though they have this abundant amount of room for people to post data, right? But then on the other hand, you sort of have this techno optimist view, right? A future with technology should be a future with abundance. Everything should be abundant, everything should be cheap. Humans shouldn't have to work because the cost of producing everything so cheap, and we just get everything for free, there's like infinite amount of energy from like 10 billion nuclear reactors out there. And I think that's kind of like the other side of the argument that you're seeing, right? DA should be cheap because that enables this cambrian explosion of innovation and new use cases to be built on a blockchain.
01:04:31.230 - 01:05:32.674, Speaker D: And I do think it's fairly hard to balance those two, right? On one hand, you do want a chain that's generating profit, because at some point you're not going to hold Tia unless you have a reason to. And your reason to is probably because Tia, or sedesia as a chain is making money. Unless we just get air jobs for the next 50 years, which I don't think is happening. And so trying to balance the revenue generated by the network, but also sort of like the constraints that you would sort of face as a developer building on Celestia. I'm not sure what the best answer is, to be honest. It's kind of a similar argument, kind of, to Salana. Salana generates no revenue today, but then if you ten x or 100 x of fees, there are certain applications that just don't work on Salana.
01:05:32.674 - 01:06:31.138, Speaker D: Like mostly on chain central demo order books. So I don't know, maybe there's a future where Celestia is able to sort of price discriminate more between people posting data on a celestia. I have no clue what that looks like, but definitely the valuation is hard to justify today. Even if you do some hand wavy magic, extrapolate some crazy growth rate, it's still pretty hard. But I do have to agree with you then, that I think Celeste has nailed the narrative, right? Like the whole modular money thing and some influencers starting the whole, like, if you stick, like you're going to get infinite amount of airdrops over the next cycle, they've nailed that. Whereas a lot of other sort of infrastructure protocols they struggle with. People try to understand the technology and try to compare it to it and they try to dive deep into certain security or architecture decisions.
01:06:31.138 - 01:06:48.240, Speaker D: Whereas Celestia, no one's thinking about like oh my God, is data availability sampling as good as data availability scaling? How good is 2d erasure coding and the read Solomon algorithm? They're just like, yo, I'm going to long module the money. So I think they've known that part.
01:06:50.130 - 01:07:40.830, Speaker C: I very much agree with the super strong brand durin and it just takes me back to 2020. I fumbled like a massive bag of Salana and the only investment thesis I had, I didn't know even 1% of what I knew today was just I used the chain and it was good. And I did the same thing with Argus. I was like wow. And granted Dan, you pointed out that's on Testnet, but I'm really excited to try one of these Celestia da based chains that is actually on Mainet and feel like how smooth it actually is. Because at the end of the day I do think a lot of it comes down to just is this product good? And I think that Tia and Celestia are directly competing with Ethereum. They try and come off as more ethereum aligned by integrating with the op stack, by having the option to plug that in and then having these nice diagrams that have Ethereum in them all the time and how Ethereum still has a role in the settlement part of things.
01:07:40.830 - 01:08:16.490, Speaker C: But I do think that you're basically buying an Ethereum competitor at one 100th of the valuation in terms of circulating market cap. So throwing the airdrops is candy on top. And I really like the trade for this cycle. I think it's going to perform extremely well. I would just say that the biggest threat will probably be Eigen Da, obviously, whenever that's actually live. But I do think there's going to be a fair amount of projects that don't necessarily want to be aligned with Ethereum alignment. I think some people do want to be more aligned with just Celestia modularity and that brand as a whole.
01:08:16.490 - 01:08:28.880, Speaker C: So I think there's room for both for sure. But it's going to be interesting to see play out. I have no opinion, Dan, on the longevity of the business model. I think fundamentals in a bull Market are kind of bearish because it ties price down to.
01:08:30.930 - 01:09:07.018, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And honestly, to add one point to Ren's Solana comparison, Solana is iterating on their fee model right now and the result will probably be low. Fees are maintained, but the ability to upcharge when necessary is improved upon because right now that exists. But it's a little bit unreliable, if you will. And so because of that, it's like, okay, yeah, no, they built a chain with low fees. Got a shit ton of users. People are actually building useful things on there, and now they're thinking about the economics behind it.
01:09:07.018 - 01:09:23.040, Speaker B: Not a bad way to do it. And I don't think that's something Celestia can't do. Right. Everybody uses you for Da. Figure out a new pricing model where you can maintain the fact that you pitched everybody on a low fee chain. DA service. You still need to keep that, but of charge, when it's where possible and when possible.
01:09:23.040 - 01:09:58.406, Speaker B: I think Celestia can vertically integrate and do a couple more things. I think that'd be an improved offering, and I think there's no harm in starting where they are today to get to that point. And I also think there's a huge conversation to be had around the value of settlement versus the value of DA and kind of where the value accrues in general to these different chains. But maybe I'll leave that as a teaser for next week's episode as something we can jam on, because I do think we need probably a whole segment to talk about that. So thank you guys for listening another banger episode. Appreciate you guys coming on. And to the listeners, we will be with you again next week.
