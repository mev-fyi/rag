00:00:02.810 - 00:00:19.274, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Welcome to an episode of Zero X Research, a show hosted by analysts where we will be talking with the top research talent, project founders and thought leaders in the space. We're going to ask the hard questions and we're going to get really deep in the weeds. So if that sounds like it's for you, you're in the right place. My name is Sam Martin.
00:00:19.322 - 00:00:48.902, Speaker B: And I'm Dan Smith. This show is made possible by our incredible sponsors, chainalysis and flipside. But let's get right into it. Today we have a great episode. We have a super informative interview with Westy from Blockworks Research. He covers all things Ethereum infrastructure for our team, and he really dives into the mev landscape in proof of stake Ethereum. Before we dive into that, we've got a good little intro section for you all where we're joined with two of our other fellow research analysts here at Blockworks Research, Zerox, Pibbles and Matt.
00:00:48.902 - 00:00:49.930, Speaker B: Guys, how you doing today?
00:00:50.000 - 00:00:51.774, Speaker C: What's up? Doing good. Thanks for having us.
00:00:51.812 - 00:01:14.354, Speaker B: I think one of my favorite rebrands is smart contract platforms into layer ones. It's like such a smoother, easier to understand term, and it's pretty funny how big of an influence that just like a nomenclature or a naming mechanism can really have on how this technology progresses. Sam, I know you're a big NFT guy. Any hot take?
00:01:14.392 - 00:01:55.390, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just really excited about Apple. Kind of like giving the clear guiding rules around what it's going to mean for people trying to integrate NFTs in the App Store. Obviously they're trying to take the 30% cut rate, like they want to keep that stranglehold over the market. But in general, I just think now that play and earn games have a clear guideline around what they can do in the App Store and what they can't is really good news and a big step forward. Plus, it looks like they're going to be supporting noncustodial wallets, which I wouldn't have expected, but they are going to decide where the crypto can actually come from, what kind of tokens can be included, what kind of features the NFTs can really unlock. So it's going to be limited. But I kind of view this as like the gateway drug, and I'm really happy that Apple's finally providing some clarity.
00:01:55.470 - 00:02:13.942, Speaker D: I think what's really important here with the digital collectibles is the house money effect, where you have these people who spent very little money to get in. They make some profits, they have a little more money to play with to stay in crypto. I think that's the most important thing for onboarding new people.
00:02:14.076 - 00:02:32.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you bring up a great point there. It's like super easy to hate NFTs when you see people making six figures on pictures of board apes and whatnot until you're the person doing it. Right. And I think that the red NFT has brought in a new wave of people who hadn't previously dabbled in the NFT markets. So, yeah, I like that.
00:02:32.432 - 00:02:41.390, Speaker A: Take strong agree there. What do you guys think about the FTX stablecoin? Does that surprise you at all, or is that something that you're like, man, why didn't they do that earlier?
00:02:43.170 - 00:03:05.202, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. Why didn't they do that? Like, everyone is launching their own stablecoin now. Like we're seeing with Aave and curve, although they haven't launched yet and there's no reason not to. Right. USDC circle is making an insane amount of money holding that capital. They have 40 some od billion dollars in dollars sitting in short term treasury notes. And even if it's in a bank, they're getting a ridiculous interest rate on these funds.
00:03:05.202 - 00:03:08.050, Speaker C: And it just makes so much sense for everyone to have their own stable coin.
00:03:08.130 - 00:03:42.802, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Even if it's short term, treasuries are yielding three to 4% of, like you said, $40 billion is no small reward. We even see finance kind of moving in this direction with popularizing BUSD for their clients. They're really kind of forcing that on there, I believe recently they announced that they're converting all stablecoins on their platform into BUSD and still giving users the ability to kind of withdraw into a different token. But while they're on exchange, they're held in BUsD. So, yeah, I think this is a pretty smart move by them to kind of capture a new market in two years.
00:03:42.856 - 00:03:46.630, Speaker A: Would you say that FTX's stablecoin is bigger or binance's?
00:03:48.410 - 00:03:53.670, Speaker D: That's a tough one. I think I'm going to go with binance because binance is king.
00:03:54.410 - 00:03:56.200, Speaker A: Matt, you got a take there?
00:03:56.730 - 00:04:07.100, Speaker C: I would tend to agree. Binance is so ingrained in the space, and even though maybe in the US, FTX and FTX's dollar will be more popular, I think across the globe, binance is just a step ahead.
00:04:08.110 - 00:04:23.482, Speaker A: Fair enough. Fair enough. So what do you guys think about Elon taking over Twitter? People are speculating that this is kind of a pay on payments, that that's always been his passion. What he wants to do. Do you think there's any crypto integration coming in the future? And is it dogecoin?
00:04:23.546 - 00:04:56.220, Speaker C: So I think Elon's made it clear that there will be payment integration now, whether or not it's dogecoin, I'm not going to speculate on. I would tend to believe probably not. But I don't want to say that because anyone who longed doge over the last week is up big. We're out here in the governance forums, like looking on chain, spending our time doing in depth research, and none of us have made as much money this past week as people who are just so, you know, salute to the kings and queens out there trading dogecoin. But honestly, I definitely would tend to believe that that might not be the case.
00:04:57.710 - 00:05:02.314, Speaker A: Matt is talking about himself here, by the way. He was leveraged along dogecoin.
00:05:02.442 - 00:05:05.790, Speaker C: For the record, no comment.
00:05:07.010 - 00:05:39.820, Speaker D: Yeah, I think this is low key. Like, it could be really bullish for lens. All it takes is, I mean, no matter who takes over, like, it could be anybody. There's always a rough transition. So hopefully Elon fumbles something and ruins Twitter and then it just really encourages a lot of people to move to lens and maybe we can actually make some money off of that somehow. Because if I'm Elon and I'm a profit maxi, I'm just going to throw ads all over Twitter like you've never seen before.
00:05:42.110 - 00:05:51.338, Speaker A: I love it. Pibbles with the money. Move plays always. Let's move into the hot seat cool throne section of this. Dan, do you want to start us off? Who's your hot seat this week?
00:05:51.424 - 00:05:59.566, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do it. Hot seat alt layer ones. I mean, it's been a rough go the past couple of weeks for this, but especially this past week.
00:05:59.588 - 00:05:59.726, Speaker A: Right?
00:05:59.748 - 00:06:39.638, Speaker B: So we've seen near's USN stablecoin was shut down. The team announced there was under collateralized by about $40 million. This USN stablecoin seemed promising and quickly proved to not be. So not a good sign there. Then we have Salana Tvl falling under $1 billion, which is pretty, actually a big milestone here because optimism and arbitrum two eth l two s actually have more Tvl than Salana. So you're kind of seeing that the place to be is ethereum and these alt layer ones are kind of falling off. And then just to put a huge exclamation point on all of it, kraptos, it's a Raptos.
00:06:39.638 - 00:07:00.786, Speaker B: I mean, Apdos was just a brutally botched launch I bridged over there pretty early. It was, like, ready to play around. There's just nothing going on that's any level of exciting. Yeah. Tried to be like the positive guy when all of crypto Twitter was just shitting on it, but I've capitulated. There's no reason to be positive. So hot seat? Definitely alt layer ones.
00:07:00.786 - 00:07:33.260, Speaker B: Cool throne, zero x NGMI, the founder of Defi Llama. That man does not stop shipping. King Shippur. He's recently just launched Llamalend, which is an NFT lending platform. On top of all of the data dominance that Defi llama is pushing into their recent hacks platform or their hacks dashboard is awesome. It's kind of a scary chart when you see how much money has been exploited from Defi, but I think that helps drive innovation and hardening forward. Right.
00:07:33.260 - 00:07:39.134, Speaker B: We have to accept the fact that we've had these mistakes in the past and kind of build off them and move forward.
00:07:39.172 - 00:07:41.630, Speaker C: Do you think Xerox not going to make it ever sleeps?
00:07:42.690 - 00:07:44.400, Speaker A: Never. There's no way.
00:07:45.990 - 00:08:03.634, Speaker B: I'm partially convinced he's like three different people that pretend to be one. But then if you read his tweets and I'm in a couple of discords with them, all the talk is so fluid. So I did have this conspiracy, but I think I'm back to. It's just one person that is a pure grinder.
00:08:03.682 - 00:08:29.962, Speaker A: All right, I could take this one next hot seat. I'm kind of riding off the coattails of Dan, but I'm going anatoly after the mango exploit or poorly designed protocol that was taken advantage of. Not him, but other people have been tweeting how Solana Defi is just absolutely dead. And I saw he liked one of the tweets. So that is enough to get it on the hot seat for this week. In terms of cool throne, I would definitely have to go with the Zkevm teams. They're all kind of fighting on Twitter over open source code and whatnot.
00:08:29.962 - 00:08:41.700, Speaker A: But in general, I think they're all educating a lot of people on ZK tech through their Twitter accounts and blog posts. So I think that's awesome, and I think it's pushing the space forward. Pibbles, you want to go next?
00:08:42.470 - 00:09:28.402, Speaker D: Yeah, I got it. So my hot seat is definitely apecoin. And that entire dao, they don't know what the hell they're doing with staking. They put up a proposal, literally yesterday, talking about a $5 million bug bounty on the staking contract, which is supposed to go live next week. So they want to get it audited so that just that way nothing goes horribly wrong because we know that board apes love to lose money in all kinds of different ways. So what's funny, actually, is that the bug bounty proposal is currently not going through. So everyone's voting against it because they want staking as soon as possible.
00:09:28.402 - 00:10:10.606, Speaker D: So this kind of sets the precedent for the community. Are they going to be fast and reckless or slow and careful? If the bug bounty passes, then staking rewards would be delayed until December. But if the bug bounty doesn't pass, then staking will probably go live next week. Rewards start mid November and someone's going to exploit it probably then. For cool Throne, I have Pentoshi just on crypto Twitter. He got bearish at like 60k bitcoin. He sold the top, I think maybe like two weeks ago he started buying his coins back like ethereum, probably like 1300 bitcoin, 19k level.
00:10:10.606 - 00:10:18.030, Speaker D: And he kind of just rode this rally like a King and then he sold everything at the top and now he's just fiving.
00:10:18.110 - 00:10:27.990, Speaker A: So God, to your trader strong, agree on that one. Pentoshi is like one of the only big accounts that I actually truly respect. That guy nailed this last cycle.
00:10:29.370 - 00:10:53.870, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he literally called the top. For my hot seat. I'm going with core scientific. Core scientific is one of North America's largest bitcoin mining companies and their stock is down 99% from the top. In November of last year, it was down 78% on Thursday. Last week alone. They have over a billion dollars in debt, a lot of which is to creditors like Blockfi, Anchorage, Nydig.
00:10:53.870 - 00:11:27.878, Speaker C: So we might see like a potential bankruptcy could have a butterfly effect that goes into other areas of crypto, which obviously would not be ideal. Also, they're currently operating at a loss as their electricity cost is rising and bitcoin's price is too low for them to make a profit. So whether or not they're going to go bankrupt or if the stocks buy or sell, I have no idea. I'm not an equity analyst, but clearly they're in some trouble, so they deserve to be in the hot seat. I think as far as my cool throne, it's going over to the kings at Golden Tree and Golden chain. Golden Tree is a huge hedge fund, $45 billion. And the crypto traders over there are the golden chain part of the company.
00:11:27.878 - 00:11:53.774, Speaker C: They longed sushi about 20 some od days ago, and their bags are up at least 60% since they did. They announced it publicly. So I could say with a high degree of confidence that a large portion of their gain was from their public announcement. Even crazier. If they wanted to, they could probably get a net short position, sell their public on chain bag, everyone knows their address, and ride it even crazier. I'm not saying they're going to do that. They probably won't, but it's just insane to see what they're doing.
00:11:53.774 - 00:12:07.438, Speaker C: And this kind of activist investment in crypto is definitely something that's going to be repeated. They're setting the stage. Everyone's going to kind of copy them, if I had to guess. And I think that the kings and queens traders over there definitely deserve a head nod.
00:12:07.534 - 00:12:14.726, Speaker A: Yeah, strong agree there. Couldn't agree more. I think that's a trend that we'll see. Continue. Dan, you want to get our flipside chart of the day pulled up?
00:12:14.748 - 00:12:48.962, Speaker B: So we have this great dashboard here that actually Matt flagged. He actually tweeted about this yesterday. It's built by Kakamura from, he's an analyst over at Flipside crypto. And this is a great dashboard covering all things sushi. So he's got a couple different tabs here, ranging from user interactions, transaction volume, fees and revenue breaks down, some of their liquidity pools, and even some market share analysis. And so for those of you listening rather than watching on YouTube, some of these charts are super informative. Right.
00:12:48.962 - 00:13:30.542, Speaker B: I always find it pretty entertaining to go look at transaction volumes and revenues on different blockchains for these protocols that are crosschain now. And we still see Ethereum main net accounting for 95, 96% of all revenue for sushi swap, even though it has launched on some of these other l two s. And so they're gradually gaining traction. But we're still kind of in that development phase. And then transaction volumes for Dexes, I think, is always a really fascinating metric. We see that the peak back in November, transactions on sushi swap kind of topped out around 1.7 ish million transactions, and now we're kind of falling right around that 900k level.
00:13:30.542 - 00:13:46.354, Speaker B: So on chain activity has definitely cooled off, and Dex transactions and Dex volume is a great way to monitor this. But Matt, actually, you flagged two really interesting charts, and I'd love to dive into those and kind of get you to walk us through what you found out here.
00:13:46.472 - 00:14:25.306, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's actually really nice finding this dashboard because Sushi is a protocol that doesn't have a whole lot of great data out there. Normally, I'd have to query it myself and have other teammates at blockworks research help me. So coming across this was great, just looking through it as I wrote my report on sushi last week, the bull and bear case, you should check that out. There's a good Twitter thread too, just a little plug. But anyways, I saw this chart and it's interesting to see that more than 50% of users across all of the chains that sushi is deployed on are trading on arbitrum. So that's a lot, right? When they launched on Ethereum initially, I would have totally expected Ethereum to have the majority of traders, but it was really interesting to see this. I then went and checked another chart, which was their volume charts.
00:14:25.306 - 00:15:04.150, Speaker C: So here we saw the volume split up by chains. And as you can see, arbitram only accounts for about 20% of the total volume. So while there's a ton of trading going on on arbitrum sushi swap, there's not as much volume as on Ethereum main net, which still makes up far the majority. There's a few possible thesis of why this could be true. I guess the optimistic one would be that because arbitrum has low transaction fees, people who don't have enough capital to trade on Ethereum mainnet can go to arbitrum to trade smaller amounts of capital. Maybe a little more pessimistically and maybe also, in my opinion, maybe a little more likely. It's probably people hunting for an RB token airdrop just using the network, maybe wash trading.
00:15:04.150 - 00:15:25.380, Speaker C: But no matter what, it's interesting to see so much activity on arbitrum and it's really good to see at the end of the day because as Ethereum scales and more users come on, next bull run comes around. It's like Ethereum mainnets fees will do the same thing that happened last time. So we will need these roll ups in order to support Ethereum scaling. It's also great that someone was able to make this dashboard with flipside because this data is really hard to come by.
00:15:27.350 - 00:16:23.714, Speaker B: Yeah, and this was a great find, just to kind of recap what you said for those of you again listening and not watching along on YouTube. So basically we have two charts here, and the first one is a distribution of users by blockchain, and it shows that about 50% or so of sushi swap users are using Ethereum main net are using arbitram. And while only about like 30 or so percent are on Ethereum main net, so the users themselves, counting the wallet addresses, and then if we go over and look at the distribution of swap volume. So rather than counting the wallets, we're counting the amount of dollars traded, and we'll see that kind of the opposite is true. And there's 76% of transaction volume is occurring on main net, while a smaller portion, only 20%, is on arbitrum. So we have 50% of the users on arbitram, but only 20% of the transaction volume. And I definitely agree with your slightly more pessimistic take, Matt.
00:16:23.714 - 00:16:44.442, Speaker B: I think that this is really, it's airdrop hunting season. We're in the depths of a bear market. There's not a lot going on. People are hunting these airdrops. I think it was just yesterday the trending contracts on Nansen were literally all just potential airdrops. So definitely kind of feeling like that's the direction we're moving right now. Yeah.
00:16:44.442 - 00:17:27.386, Speaker B: And again, just want to give a special shout out to flipside for this data. They have the most comprehensive on chain data in crypto to help you get the insights that you need to work smarter, and they give you the ability to instantly query this data yourself. And if you don't have the SQL skills to do so, I highly recommend that you kind of take the time to dive into SQL. It's pretty easy to learn as far as programming languages go, and it just gives you the opportunity to kind of build these dashboards and create this analysis yourself. But if that's not the case, flipside does have like a public dashboard or public dashboards that anybody can go check out, just like this one here. We'll link this in the show notes for sure. And definitely be sure to check out the exclusive offer that Flipside has set up for us.
00:17:27.386 - 00:18:09.958, Speaker B: Right, so zero x research listeners have an exclusive opportunity to earn up to $75 in USDC just by completing a simple bounty. Again, we will link that in the show notes, but be sure to check that out. And yeah, one more chart I wanted to take a look at here and kind of get your take on Matt. So this is monthly breakdown of sushi's market share on Ethereum mainnet. And it compares sushi swap volumes to that of Uniswap curve and balancer. And if you can see, back in 2021, the market share was pretty solid, like sushi swaps annotated in this pink chart or this pink color here. And they had like a respectable size of the market back in early 2021.
00:18:09.958 - 00:18:23.854, Speaker B: But as time's gone on, Uniswap and Curve have kind of eaten away at that market share. And I was curious to get your take. You're our in house sushi expert, so I'd love to get your take on on what sushi can do and what they can focus on to kind of regain some of that market share.
00:18:23.892 - 00:18:24.046, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:18:24.068 - 00:19:01.282, Speaker C: And just to clear one little thing up about the past chart I went over, I forgot to mention. It's just that both of those statistics, the over 50% of users and 20% of volume, were both for the month of October. So this is like new, and it hadn't been true in the past. Anyways, to Dan's next question, Sushi is like, the technology that it deploys right now is Uniswap V two, and it's not really competitive in the market compared to Uniswap V three and curve, they're just better technologies. And Uniswap V two can't really compete. They are working on something called trident, which is a concentrated liquidity Amm. If sushi is to come back and take back their market share and maybe even take over the market, they need trident to be extremely successful.
00:19:01.282 - 00:19:35.246, Speaker C: It needs to be more capital efficient, and it needs to attract enough lps. So then as deep liquidity pairs, and once it has deep liquidity pairs, it'll get the trading volume and says the trading volume will get the fees. So it needs that flywheel in order to succeed. Additionally, Sushi is working on a couple of other things that I think could really help with entrenching it and its market share. They're the first decks that I know of that launched, or they're not the first, but the biggest that launched an omnichan decks, meaning you can trade across chains. So they use Stargate to do that. But if you want to, say, use your USDC on eth mainnet and go buy GMX token on Arbitrum, you can actually do that in one click on sushi.
00:19:35.246 - 00:20:09.662, Speaker C: It's called Xtrade or Xswap sushi xswap. So I think they need to continue to capture that market, the omnichan market. And that'll help entrench them in the long term as well. Two more things that I think would really help is right now, their spending and their treasury is kind of out of line. There's a lot know, maybe they've had issues with leadership in the past that have led to not great organization within the DAO, but I think this is actually being worked on currently. They just hired a new chef, Jared Gray, and kind of his whole job is to audit the protocol, audit the team, see where money's being spent, that maybe it shouldn't how the protocol should move forward. So I think he's really going to help with that.
00:20:09.662 - 00:20:30.882, Speaker C: But definitely they need to get their organization in check and their treasury spending. And lastly, I would say that they kind of need a new tokenomic design. The way the sushi token works today is a little outdated. It's not very sexy for investors, and I think that a revamp of the token would really help with bringing them back into kind of the common narrative.
00:20:31.026 - 00:20:48.630, Speaker B: Yeah, some of these gen one tokens definitely could use a revamp, there's no doubt about that. And yeah, I also agree their partnership with layer Zero and doing that omnichain activity is pretty bullish in my opinion. But Sam, anything else you want to hit here, or should we kind of jump over and get ready for this interview with Westy?
00:20:48.710 - 00:20:52.426, Speaker A: No, I think that's all we got. Thanks for coming on, pipples and matt, that was great.
00:20:52.608 - 00:20:54.602, Speaker D: It's my pleasure, of course.
00:20:54.656 - 00:20:55.550, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:20:55.620 - 00:21:15.534, Speaker A: Before we get over to our interview with Westy on Mev and proof of stake Ethereum, I need to shout out chainalysis. They have some of the best on chain forensics tools of anyone in the space, and you can always be sure that the data is accurate. They also have great research on their site on the insights tab, which we can link to the show notes. Super underrated tool. Great insights and I highly recommend you check them out over to west.
00:21:15.582 - 00:21:24.200, Speaker B: Westy, great to have you on, man. We're really excited to chat about this recent report you wrote. It was titled MeV in proof of stake Ethereum. Westy, how you doing today?
00:21:24.650 - 00:21:27.398, Speaker E: Doing well, man. Appreciate you guys having me on.
00:21:27.484 - 00:22:16.680, Speaker B: Love to hear. So this is all kind of about the mev process in the proof of stake Ethereum world. We're now living in post merge. Right at the beginning of this report, you kind of gave a great definition of what MeV is, and that is the amount of profit that a privileged entity can generate by including, excluding or reordering transactions from the block they produce. And so in the proof of work Ethereum world, you kind of go into how that was like the miner's role, but now with this transition to proof of stake, there's like a different process for what this is. So I'd love to hear a little bit about what this process is and the creator of this process, right? So flashbots. So if you could dive into what flashbots is and what Mev boost is, I'd love to hear kind of how that transaction flow works.
00:22:18.250 - 00:23:31.790, Speaker E: Definitely going back to that definition, I kind of want to change that a bit. At the end, I said it comes from transactions, from the blocks that they produce, which inherently basically suggests that only privileged entities are the miners of the validators, which is the case in Ethereum, but with something, let's say, like Solana, the privilege actor isn't necessarily a validator, but the privilege actor is the entity that has the fastest latency, because they can essentially order the transactions the way they want, because they were able to extract the MeV opportunity that others couldn't. So just wanted to clarify that first, because MEV obviously doesn't just exist on Ethereum. But, yeah, I'd love to, I guess, start giving sort of a background on MEV, like how the concepts came to be. Essentially, I think it was 2019, there was a paper written, called Slash Boys 2.0, which was like the first paper to actually define MeV in a similar way that I just defined it. And it basically highlighted arbitrage opportunities, sandwich attacks, things that existed as a result of dexes on smart contract platforms.
00:23:31.790 - 00:24:34.110, Speaker E: And this basically opened up the doorway for more research on MEV, how it's extracted, how certain entities can extract it. And it sort of opened up the door for research entities to come in who are specifically focused on MEV. And one of those was flashbots, which was created in 2020, and it wanted to essentially mitigate the negative externalities of MEV. And those can be like centralization, because of one entity is the only one that's extracting this MEV. All of a sudden they can, especially in a proof of stake network, they can accumulate more stake than other validators. And all of a sudden you have some sort of centralization function, which is just not good for the network. And then also bot spamming, because like I said on Solana, MEV is extracted using latency, and that's obviously not good because it increases the gas cost in something like Ethereum.
00:24:34.110 - 00:25:45.370, Speaker E: Prior to MevGeth, essentially, MEV was extracted through bot spamming, which was just not good. And so it wanted to mitigate these negative externalities as well as just bring sort of transparency to MEV, because it was kind of like a dark forest, which is actually a paper written by paradigm about Mev. No one really knew what was going on, so I wanted to bring transparency, democratize the access to this MEV reward so it wasn't by the same entities and figuring out the most sustainable way to distribute that MEV. And so first they created MeV Geth, which was basically like a version of the Go Ethereum client, but it had some sort of sealed id block space auction. And rather than a transaction going through the mempool, it would go through this Mevgeth auction, and there'd be different parties along the way that would essentially compete for the right to be included in a block. And we can get to that transaction flow in a second. But this competition basically meant less network congestion because you didn't see those bot spammers and then less centralization.
00:25:45.370 - 00:26:10.658, Speaker E: So it really did mitigate those negative externalities of MeV. And miners that used MeV Geth got, I think, over 100% APR increase in rewards. And so it was pretty lucrative. And I think 80% to 90% of miners are running this client. And then now, in a proof of stake world, they upgraded that to mev boost, which we can get into now, if you'd like.
00:26:10.824 - 00:26:46.026, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So essentially, flashbots was this entity that kind of was created to develop ways to mitigate the negative externalities of MeV, and they kind of created this system called Mevboost. So, yeah, I'd love to dive in there, kind of what that system is, and especially like that transaction flow. You made a great image here that kind of highlights how this transaction flow, what it looks like, and I'd love to share screen here. Just the audience can see what this looks like. So here's sharing the screen here. Here's this transaction flow.
00:26:46.026 - 00:26:54.338, Speaker B: So you could just walk us through this, what each of these parties is responsible for doing and kind of how this system breaks down, certainly.
00:26:54.424 - 00:28:02.514, Speaker E: Yeah. So it starts from the user, they basically have a transaction intent saying, I want this transaction included. And essentially it sends out an RPC, which is basically communication, basically saying, I want this transaction included, and that either is routed through some sort of public RPC infrastructure and goes to a public mempool where anyone can see the transactions that people want included, or it goes to some private RPC service, and we can get to the concept of exclusive order flow later. But going from the public mem pool essentially goes through the first to people called searchers, which basically take these transactions and order them into bundles that extract MEV. And essentially they can then bribe the block builders, the next entity to have those bundles included, conditional on the MEV opportunity that they are looking to capture. And essentially they profit the spread between the bribe that they give the block builder and then the MEV that they were able to capture. The next entity, like I said, is the block builder.
00:28:02.514 - 00:29:28.610, Speaker E: So they're in charge of taking those bundles from searchers, and then any other transactions that maybe there wasn't mev opportunities involved. They take all of that, they try and basically produce the highest value block they possibly can, and then they, in the same way as searchers, then pay the validators, essentially a cut of the revenue that they were able to generate, one from the searchers brides, as well as any other opportunities from transactions to be included. And they make that spread. And then between the block builders and the relay, or in the validators, is the relays, which is essentially just like a filter mechanism. So they ensure that the blocks themselves are valid, and then they rank them based on economic value within the blocks and how much they're willing to pay. And then from there, you have validators which communicate with either multiple relays or a specific relay of their choice to get the most profitable block header that they can find, and then they validate and finalize that block on chain. And the relays are sort of the entity that's most concerning when it comes to censorship, because of that filtering, because they're able to filter, they can basically say, we only want blocks that are OFAC compliant.
00:29:28.610 - 00:29:44.360, Speaker E: And sort of, that's where a lot of the contention comes from when it comes to censorship. But if you have any other questions on sort of the flow, the different actors in the supply chain definitely ask away.
00:29:44.730 - 00:30:06.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm curious. The private rpCs, the only, I guess, step in this equation that's going to be skipped is the searchers. So it just goes straight to the block builders. That makes a lot of sense. But then how does all of this MeV actually end up into people staking eth? Like, if I'm staking eth with Lido, how do I get my yield? How do I get my mev and my tips?
00:30:06.442 - 00:30:47.210, Speaker E: I'm not sure if you're asking specifically about the exclusive order flow, but in general, how it goes to the validators is, like I said, you have searchers that basically bribe the block builders to have their transactions included. Then the block builders bribe the validators, or at least pay the validators based on the value that their block provides, and sort of that value, because of the competition between searchers and between block builders, that spread is going to be minimized. And so essentially, that's like capturing MeV and bringing it to the validators. It's not 100% of the MEV, but it's pretty close to it, given that there's competition at each of these levels.
00:30:47.950 - 00:31:00.078, Speaker A: Okay. And on the same vein, is there sufficient competition right now? Is Mevboost censorship resistant, or would you say that there's a lot more work to be done on that front?
00:31:00.244 - 00:31:39.820, Speaker E: Yeah, that's a good question. I think at the searcher level, I think it's definitely. There's good competition, because a lot of people want to extract med for themselves, and so the searchers definitely. There's a lot of competition. One of the issues I see with the design of Medboost is sort of like the block builder, because essentially they can see all the same transactions as searcher can, which is kind of a problem. And they can also see the bundles and the transactions in the bundles that are sent from searchers. So if block builders really wanted to, they could front run the searchers, basically see the MEV opportunities and capture it themselves.
00:31:39.820 - 00:32:21.026, Speaker E: So I wonder, is this happening right now? I guess not, but I wonder, because there's really nothing stopping them, other than maybe if block builders start doing this and searchers will stop sending their bundles to them. But if block builders can therefore make better blocks because they extract the MEV opportunities and not searchers, maybe that's the direction things go, I'm not sure. So that's sort of one problem of contention, and then the relays is sort of its own issue. So you have, like, five different relays, which we can go through, which are flashbots, manifold blocks. Route. Blocks route. Actually use three of them, Eden and block native.
00:32:21.026 - 00:33:27.626, Speaker E: And this competition between the relays is interesting because we'll get to the data later, but essentially, flashbots is the only relay that is permissionless, meaning that any block builder can send them a block, whereas other relays aren't permissionless. So, basically, you have to be on a whitelist in order to have your block being sent to that relay. And flashbots is also an OFAC compliant relay, and so they're censoring. And because of these two factors, flashbots is usually building the highest value blocks with their relay. I think they're being used 80% of the time, which is definitely a problem because of the censorship. So, really what we need to see is more combination of permissionless and non censoring relays. I think we just got one from builder Zero X 69 is one of the biggest block builders.
00:33:27.626 - 00:33:55.078, Speaker E: He just built a new relay that's both permissionless and non censoring. And so I think the relays is definitely the biggest point of contention when it comes to censorship. And I think there just needs to be more competition, more open source nature, when it comes to these relays. And I'm excited to see sort of what the future holds, because a lot of people are complaining about this censorship, and I think there's a lot of ways in which we can mitigate it at this level.
00:33:55.164 - 00:34:05.340, Speaker B: It sounds like the process of Nevboost itself is inherently not censorship or prone to censorship. It comes down to this relay section. Would you agree with that?
00:34:06.110 - 00:34:48.498, Speaker E: Yeah. So it comes down to relays and then the interaction with the block builders and the relays, because, like I said, the relays are sort of the filter. So they explicitly choose which blocks they want, and they're going to choose OFAC compliant blocks. But then there's also block builders that need to build those blocks. So they need to also censor if they want to be included in the flashbots relay, for example. And so, yeah, because the relays are essentially filtering and choosing OFAC compliant blocks, and that flashbots is both OFAC compliant and permissionless, I think that's sort of what's contributing to the censorship.
00:34:48.594 - 00:35:01.994, Speaker A: Would you say that centralized exchanges, because they run a lot of validators, do you think that they're a threat to the censorship of ethereum? Or do you think for them, it's in their best interest to not censor transactions and avoid a hard fork?
00:35:02.042 - 00:35:53.914, Speaker E: If it eventually did come to definitely. It obviously depends on their jurisdiction. Like, are they in the. Like, do they need to be OFAC compliant? Do they think that they need to be OFAC compliant? I think that's a big issue, but I think beyond that, I think it's definitely in their best interest to not censor. Well, to, one, opt into Mev boost because they get an increase in validator rewards, but also, two, to not censor, because non censoring blocks, just from the fact that they get more transactions included, should therefore lead to higher rewards. So just from, like, a profit perspective, it's obviously better. But exchanges make money because people are buying coins that at least are perceived to have value.
00:35:53.914 - 00:36:50.160, Speaker E: And if all of a sudden east value drops because it becomes some sort of censorship chain, well, that's obviously bad for the exchanges in turn. And so I think there's definitely a lot of value in these exchanges, like trying not to be censorship prone, but we'll see a lot of these, it looks like, well, binance, first of all, has finally opted in half of their blocks, it looks like, to Mev boost, and are choosing flashbots as their majority relay. But, yeah, I'd love to see how this goes, because a lot of them are just producing vanilla blocks, which I'm not sure if they're censoring or not which is sort of also an issue. But, yeah, I think they go in the direction of non censoring and extracting as much value as possible.
00:36:51.650 - 00:37:14.150, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. Now, for the people who are listening on Apple or Spotify, I think it'd be helpful to maybe walk them through a transaction and how it would all look. Can you do that on. Basically, if it's going to a public mem pool, but then also if it's exclusive order flow and kind of an example to give the listener a better understanding for where the threats lie. For exclusive order flow.
00:37:15.450 - 00:38:11.526, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's pretty simple when it goes through public RPC. So, yeah, you have your transaction intents, goes to the public mempool, and then if there's an MEv extraction opportunity, a searcher sees that transaction and then extracts the MEV. But if there is an MEv opportunity, just goes straight to the block builders who are going to include it in their block, and then from there, it goes through the relay. Whichever block either has the highest value or highest value within a relay of a validator's choice, well, then that block gets included and your transaction gets included. If, let's say, your transaction is like a censored transaction, so you come from a list, let's say you use tornado cash and you're sanctioned. Well, how that's going to work is you go in the public mem pool, searchers might pick it up if there's an mvv opportunity.
00:38:11.526 - 00:38:42.914, Speaker E: And then block builders. Well, depending on if the block builder wants to build an OFAC compliant block or not, well, they'll see your transaction and they'll include it. If they don't want to be compliant, or if they do, they won't include it. And then, yeah, it usually takes. Because there's 40. Well, we assume that there's 40% of blocks that aren't being censored. It's going to take, on average, two and a half blocks for your transaction to be included, which really isn't that long.
00:38:42.914 - 00:39:18.250, Speaker E: It's like 30 seconds. But if we see more adoption of Medboost and the flashbots relay still has the highest market share there, then that could be more of an issue. You could have to wait longer, but that's sort of how it works. And then, yeah, we can definitely get into exclusive order flow. So that obviously depends. So, exclusive order flow, to define it, is essentially transactions that a subset of searchers and block builders can have access to that others don't. And that's what makes it exclusive.
00:39:18.250 - 00:40:21.806, Speaker E: And essentially because of this, you'd think that either these searchers can extract more mvp. The block builders that have access to it can build higher value blocks, which is sort of a centralization force. But it's also like there's an incentive there to have exclusive order flow because you can essentially extract more mev than other people can. And we're sort of seeing exclusive order flow emerge as a lot of protocols are trying to extract exclusive order flow. So the biggest we've seen so far is manifold, which is one of the bigger players in the MEv space. But essentially they're trying to have transactions routed through their RPC so that they explicitly can either extract the mev opportunities themselves or block mev opportunities from the end user. And if they do extract mev, rather than that ending up in the validator's hands, that it goes back to the user.
00:40:21.806 - 00:41:28.066, Speaker E: And so, yeah, exclusive order flow, I think, is going to be a pretty hot topic throughout the next six months to the next couple of years, because I think that's sort of the next place in which people are competing because they're able to essentially front run this mev boost design. Because if I just send it to the private RPC for exclusive order flow, it never sees these open source searchers or builders. It's sort of once again like a dark forest in its own place. And I think, yeah, we're going to see more people compete for their right to have exclusive order flow. And I think we're going to see what looks similar in sort of trad five venues where you have payment to order flow. And so you're going to have entities that are willing to essentially pay users to have their order flow go through them, and maybe they extract mev or other opportunities that way. And I'd rather have an mev boost design because all the mev opportunities are open source.
00:41:28.066 - 00:41:44.942, Speaker E: They're democratized. Anyone can extract them. Whereas if you have some sort of exclusive order flow, that's obviously a centralization risk. So there's sort of two sides of the coin where you're incentivized to have exclusive order flow, but that's obviously really bad for the chain in general.
00:41:45.076 - 00:42:07.310, Speaker B: If you can't tell, we love data here at blockroots research and chainalysis, the leading blockchain analytics company, shares this passion with us. We use data to extract alpha and find the next thing coming in DeFi. But chainalysis is doing the gritty work in building trust in blockchains to onboard the next trillion dollars of capital into the industry. We need to grow safe consumer access to cryptocurrency and promote more financial freedom with less risk.
00:42:07.390 - 00:42:26.394, Speaker A: Chainalysis has some of the most comprehensive and reliable data in the space, and they use this data to power a full suite of their solutions that can be utilized by industry professionals. Best in class training and certifications are also led by chainalysis and some of the brightest minds in the space. If you haven't heard of chainalysis, you got to check them out and we'll link to them in the show.
00:42:26.432 - 00:42:49.650, Speaker B: Notes this seems like a perfect opportunity to kind of segue into you mentioned manifold and how they're creating tools for protocols to use in secure RPC and OpenMev. I'd love to hear a little bit more about what they do and kind of how that kind of creates this environment for where it might be beneficial to protocols themselves to route this exclusive order flow.
00:42:50.710 - 00:43:16.390, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. I can go into more detail on manifolds. Yeah. They have two products which are secure RPC and OpenMev, and they work sort of in tandem with each other. So secure RPC is their RPC service. So essentially like a user and application, when you want to send a transaction, the RPC will be routed through them. So that's sort of where we saw the exclusive order flow within the transaction flow we saw earlier.
00:43:16.390 - 00:44:38.034, Speaker E: And then OpenMeV is like a service built on top of this, and it's basically allows protocols to recapture the MEV that gets created through user transactions on their platform, and then that either gets distributed back to the users or it gets distributed back to the protocol's revenue. And we've seen Sushiswap integrated with OpenMeV. So now any trade on Sushiswap can basically use OpenMEV, and they specifically design sort of like an auction based engine for bundling trades. So you can think of it similar to Cowswap's coincidence of wants, and then OpenMev can basically use secure RPC in whatever unique way to help the MeV of that specific protocol. So sushiswap, like that sort of coincidence of wants type style trading is perfect for designing MeV around specifically how Sushiswap is designed. But if a different protocol is designed differently, wants to sort of mitigate or extract MEV for themselves in a different way, they're going to design a different system, which is definitely unique and exciting in its own way. But obviously, as we said before, this is a centralization risk.
00:44:38.034 - 00:45:24.418, Speaker E: But in terms of manifolds perspective, for them, there's sort of a flywheel, and that the more essentially, transactions they can route through secure RPC. Through OpenMeV. They're able to essentially build the most blocks because they're also a block builder, build the highest value blocks, which means they're going to be more likely to be included. And then from there, essentially, other protocols can see, hey, they're extracting this MeV, and it's coming back to us and our users. We're going to route our trades through them, and it becomes a flywheel where more protocols are more likely to use their exclusive order flow. And then manifold is able to build higher value blocks and generate revenue based on the MOV they extract as well, which is super interesting.
00:45:24.584 - 00:46:05.294, Speaker B: So, essentially, it sounds like Manifold has created its own private RPC, so it can create this environment where it can capture this exclusive order flow. And it created an auction system where it can then take its private order flow and mix it with the public memp pool to create higher value blocks because they're picking from a larger pool of transactions. Right. If there's a massive trade to purchase ETH on Sushiswap, right. Then that would definitely create the opportunity for MeV. And again, if this was coming through a private route, then they have the ability to use this trade when no other searchers do. So it definitely makes sense.
00:46:05.294 - 00:46:58.206, Speaker B: It's like, all right, MeV's inevitable. Let's kind of create this environment where we can capture it and then essentially hand it to the protocols. And now it's on the protocols to say, hey, do we want to give this back to our users? What do we want to do with this extra value? So it's kind of a cool to me, it's really fascinating that they've accepted that this will exist and kind of like trying to repurpose it and allow protocols to have the option to go and repurpose this MEV and maybe give it back to the users. And the flywheel that you mentioned is super intriguing, right? More private order flow leads to creating the ability to have more transactions that can create higher value blocks. And then once the protocol starts seeing this, like, hey, this is a huge opportunity, and it's only growing. It's like this positive feedback loop. More users will want to jump in here and kind of participate in this.
00:46:58.206 - 00:47:14.120, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really cool to see them capturing this, but I'd love to hear a little bit more about a couple other players in this space. I know that you mentioned Eden blocksroute and block native. I don't want to dive too deep on here, but if you can just kind of briefly mention the services that the three of these offer. It'd be great to have a recap there.
00:47:15.290 - 00:47:56.370, Speaker E: Yeah, so the biggest entities in sort of the MEV space, they all run their own relay, they all build their own blocks as well. So just keep that in mind. But yeah, the three other entities that we haven't touched on are Eden network. So it's like similar to manifold. It has a suite of products. They have their own private RPC that tries to minimize MEv for their users. And then you have blocks route, which is trying to essentially increase the scalability of blockchain networks through, like, they have basically their own servers that are super high performant.
00:47:56.370 - 00:48:34.820, Speaker E: So people use them for mempool data and direct transaction routing things along those lines. And so it made sense for them to get involved in sort of the MEV space and then block native, which is sort of in a similar vein, like a real time data platform for blockchain transactions focused on Ethereum. And you can look at them to gauge gas prices, simulate transaction execution like what that would look like. And so in a similar vein, it made sense for them to get involved in the MEV space. So, yeah, they all run relays and build their own blocks as well.
00:48:36.630 - 00:49:14.720, Speaker B: Awesome. So now that we kind of got this, like, we got to hit all the important information on what this space looks like, what Mev boost is, and how the transaction flow works, I'd love to get into the most exciting part to me, which is the data. Awesome. So I'm sharing my screen here, and I'd love to dive into. I think one of the burning questions people probably have is, okay, so MeV, we hear all about it. We understand how to capture it, but what does the reward size actually look like? In your report, you noted that about 27% of staking rewards come from MeV. So if you could walk us through this validator reward chart here, that'd be great.
00:49:15.810 - 00:49:56.618, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. So essentially, this is taking data from the block rewards. So essentially, transaction fees that go to validators, that's the block reward. And then potential MEV is how much like the relay is reporting their highest value block to be paying for any validated block. And so I say that's potential MEV, because relays can lie about that number if they wanted to, but obviously, if they lie too much, people will stop sending blocks to that relay, and validators will stop choosing that relay. And so they're incentivized, to be honest. But we can see that huge spike on.
00:49:56.618 - 00:50:56.510, Speaker E: I think that was October 15, because Manifold's relay was going out of control. It was basically saying there were much higher payments for blocks than there really were for about 12 hours, but they fixed that issue. So, looks like things are fine now. But if you. Yeah, you take out that entry, essentially 20% of the staking rewards have come through MEV. And then per day, the amount of MeV extracted on the average has been 119 throughout the validators, which obviously shows that there is an incentive, if you're a validator, to opt into me boost and achieve these extra rewards, because that's a 37% increase in your APR from staking, which is definitely nice, but, yeah, that's what this represents, showing. Well, we know MEv accrues to the validators, but what does that actually look like compared to just the general block reward?
00:50:57.170 - 00:51:37.500, Speaker B: So, in the depths of the bull market, excuse me, the depths of the bear market we're currently in, we're seeing around 20 ish percent of staking rewards be generated from MEV. Was it fair to think that in a bull market, this would become like an increasing percentage of staking rewards? My thought process here is kind of more transactions will be occurring on chain in the heat of a bull market, and with a lot of that being through dexes, and I'm thinking more transactions means more opportunities to reorder, add, remove transactions, and create mvv opportunities. Is that something you would agree with, or am I kind of off base there?
00:51:38.190 - 00:52:28.166, Speaker E: Yeah, it's definitely good. There's definitely an interaction between the block reward and how many transactions there are. But I do agree that definitely in a bull market mania, you're going to have a lot more speculation on dexes. There's going to be a lot more opportunities for arbitrage, for sandwiches, et cetera. And so, yeah, I do agree. But also baked in this question is like, when to get a new build run. When is that? And do we have sort of a thriving roll up ecosystem where maybe those specific roll ups are actually extracting MEV themselves before it goes down to layer one? So, yeah, I mean, obviously that could detract from the amount of MEV that's actually extracted at the base level if most of the transactions and the speculation is happening on roll ups.
00:52:28.166 - 00:52:30.394, Speaker E: So that's an interesting question to think.
00:52:30.432 - 00:53:13.974, Speaker B: About as well, right? Yeah, that's a great point, that if a lot of transaction activity really does shift to l two s, it likely will in the near future. It'd be very fascinating, especially since a lot of these l two s still have pretty centralized sequencers. This creates massive opportunities for the entities that are running these l two s. But I'd love to keep pushing along through the data here. And this chart we are sharing now is kind of validator participation by relay. And as you can see, right when the merge occurred, there was like a very low percentage of validators, the percentage of blocks that were produced through Mev boost. And as time has gone on, that number has significantly increased.
00:53:13.974 - 00:53:31.280, Speaker B: Right. So about a couple of days in, we're around 20%, but now we're up to more, around like 60, 60 or so percent. This is a clear uptrend in the post merge environment. And do you think this kind of keeps continuing? Will it ever reach 100%? And if so, what are the implications of that?
00:53:33.010 - 00:54:01.754, Speaker E: Yeah, it's a good question. I do think it will keep trucking upwards. I think most of the move we've seen is the biggest we've seen so far. I don't think it'll eventually get to 100. I mean, for the same reasons why it was kind of low at the beginning. You have some validators that are just like stake their eth, haven't even thought about it, don't even know how to connect to a relay. There's definitely some of those entities out there that are staking their eth that way.
00:54:01.754 - 00:55:24.482, Speaker E: But I do think eventually it'll probably get to 90% plus in terms of people that are opting into mev boost simply because you're getting more rewards. And like we said before, if there is some sort of boat run mania in the near future, those rewards are going to be very significant, and so there's going to be a lot of incentive to opt in. But, yeah, definitely more interesting question is, what happens if we get to 100% or close to it? I think the good is obviously, like me v boost works. You get more, like we said, more rewards as a validator, but also it brings complete transparency to the MEV that's being extracted, because we can see it through the process that it goes through, which is obviously really good. It's going to minimize the negative externalities of MEV as much as possible. Obviously, the bad is, well, what does that look like in terms of the percentage of relays chosen? So, like we talked about before, if we get to, let's say, 100% and 90% of those blocks go through flashbots relay, well, they're going to be censored. And what does that look like? I think it's fine, because as long as you have some blocks that aren't censoring, then any censored transaction can get through, they just have to wait.
00:55:24.482 - 00:55:50.266, Speaker E: But as you climb higher and higher into those numbers, at what point does it become consensus that, okay, we do need to censor? I don't think that's ever going to happen, but obviously it becomes more of an issue and sort of a thought point. So, yeah, that's sort of what it would look like once we get to those higher numbers, but I expect that we see more relay diversity going forward. Yeah.
00:55:50.288 - 00:56:03.520, Speaker A: And just so people don't get scared listening to the idea of that, because there's a lot of unknown. I'm curious. Ethereum is trying to implement proposer builder separation. So this whole Mevboost deal is actually an interim solution, correct?
00:56:05.490 - 00:56:42.380, Speaker E: Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah. This process in general will be enshrined into the Ethereum protocol and what you said as PBS, and then it's going to remove the need for the relay because the system itself can filter through the blocks, which will definitely be a big plus when it comes to censorship. And along those lines, flashbot is also building a different solution called Suave, which they haven't released details on, which is apparently like an encrypted MEV aware mempool. And so maybe that, I think that they believe that that will solve a lot of the censorship problems as well. So, yeah, definitely don't want to hype it up too much.
00:56:43.230 - 00:57:10.230, Speaker A: Okay. And then we've got an image on the screen here for the people who are listening on Apple or Spotify. And it's just the percentage of the relay market that's owned by entity. And it looks like Flashbots is just around 80% market share. Why are they so dominant? And do you expect to see more builders like Zero X 69 that you mentioned earlier in the episode, kind of spin up their own relays and make the market a little bit more diversified?
00:57:11.130 - 00:58:26.880, Speaker E: Yes, we touched on it earlier, but it's definitely good to dive in that flashbots is the only relay that's permissionless, meaning any block builder can send them blocks, whereas the other relays, you have to be whitelisted. And most of the time, those whitelisted block builders are themselves on top of that, flash bots, they're running three block builders right now, and those three block builders, or two out of the three, are like the highest value block providers or block builders that we've seen. And so the combination of those two have sort of driven flashbots to be the most used. But, yeah, like you said, if we get more relays that are permissionless and those relays are also non censoring. Those will one include as many blocks as possible, and therefore more likely to have blocks that are higher value, but also they're non censoring as well. And so the blocks are going to have even higher value than other blocks that are censored. And so if we get especially a large swath of relays that are both of those categories, then I think Flashbot's dominance will definitely go down, and a lot of the censorship concerns will go down.
00:58:28.130 - 00:59:04.650, Speaker B: And taking a look at the block builder market share here, again, this is becoming a common theme. We see flashbots dominance. So on the screen, we're showing a chart. It's a pie chart, and it kind of breaks down the builder market share by each block builder. So flashbots has about 52% of the market share, with the next largest being blocks route at 19%. And then in third, we have block builder is zero x 69, an anonymous builder with about 10% of the market share. So, again, yeah, we keep seeing a common trend here in flashbots dominance.
00:59:04.650 - 00:59:14.960, Speaker B: And I guess it does make sense that if they have the most popular relay, it's likely that they're feeding themselves these blocks. Is that the case?
00:59:16.770 - 00:59:46.310, Speaker E: Yeah. So flashbots is feeding themselves, like, their own relay, their own blocks. But they've announced on Twitter, I think, a couple of weeks ago, that they're going to start sending their blocks to other relays as well, as long as they are permissionless, like I said. And so that centralization function where flashbots has the highest value blocks, and then they also send to their relay, I think that's going to alleviate once flashbots start sending their blocks to other permissionless relays.
00:59:48.250 - 01:00:17.650, Speaker A: How do you feel about liquid staking derivative protocols? They have very much so grown in prominence. I mean, Lido has, what, 32% market share over the totally staked, and then there's Coinbase, who's launching a derivative, and then you have rocket pool stakewise, there's a bunch of different solutions. So why haven't they fully opted into Mevboost for all of the blocks that they're attesting to? Is there a reason for that? You think they'd want to give their users the highest yield?
01:00:18.470 - 01:01:16.354, Speaker E: That is a great question I wish I knew the answer to. It's funny because, like, on governance, specifically voted so that their validator should opt into mev boost, because obviously it gets the highest rewards for the protocol, which is good for everyone. So I don't know why they've had such a slow and short opt in to mev boost. I think the numbers are a little better now than when that data was sorted. I think they're at like 72% of their blocks are coming through mev boost, as opposed to like 40%, which is definitely better. But yeah, I think it's because they use a pretty diverse set of validators that I think most of the validators are opted in, and a couple of them are probably either figuring it out or don't even know that they're required to. There's definitely a lot of just probably communication issues.
01:01:16.354 - 01:01:46.560, Speaker E: And so I expect that number to be 100% within a few months. The same goes with rocket pool. I think they had a similar thing as well, where they're basically required to opt into mev boost. And then we're also seeing a trend with the exchanges starting to opt in little by little. So again, the finance number there is increasing. So they have, I think over 50% of their blocks now are opted into mev boost. And then coinbase is like very slowly ticking up.
01:01:46.560 - 01:02:02.466, Speaker E: And so I think, like we said before, it's kind of like a slow and gradual over time, more people are going to opt in because they're sort of figuring out how to, and also they extract the most profits they can that way. And so you're just incentivized to do so.
01:02:02.568 - 01:02:29.194, Speaker A: That's really cool. So I guess now that we understand that MeV is kind of being democratized through Mevboost and giving access to people who don't have the expertise to extract it, the returns. Would you say that Ethereum is more censorship resistant after the merge than it was before the merge? Are we in a better place now? Or is it kind of like we're in this rough patch right now and we're going to be really decentralized sometime soon?
01:02:29.232 - 01:03:01.494, Speaker E: In the future, do I think we're better off now than we were in proof of work? No, because right now, like you said, we're in a rough patch. We're sort of figuring things out. And just the fact that these OFAC compliance came at the right time when it came to the merge. Right. In terms of, okay, these entities sort of realized, hey, I might need to be compliant. So I think it was sort of the timing on that that made things more of a problem. At the moment, I don't think it's 100% necessarily because it was proof of stake versus proof of work.
01:03:01.494 - 01:03:46.270, Speaker E: Although validators are like entities that people know, and a lot of them are designated in the US. And so, yeah, that's definitely contributing, but I think in the long run, obviously no one on Ethereum wants it to be censored. So I think there are definitely a lot of people in the community, big actors, that want to see it not be censored. There's just a lot of people in positions that feel like they sort of have to censor. And as long as we continue to design systems that are censorship resistant, and not only should you not choose to censor, but that you can't censor, I think once we have systems like that, Ethereum is going to be totally fine from a censorship standpoint.
01:03:46.430 - 01:04:05.340, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I agree. And just a closing question that we ask all of our guests, and you're our first guest, so we're going to ask all of our guests, what's one lesson that you've learned in crypto that you had your mind set on, that you thought you were right, and then you realized in the end that you were actually wrong? And what did you learn from it? I think I know your answer, but.
01:04:05.870 - 01:04:53.802, Speaker E: Anyways, yeah, I think this one's pretty obvious. With me. It was terra. I was pretty blind set on a decentralized stablecoin that was scalable and decentralized, which was impossible to build. And I thought at the very least, they had the best model and they had a lot of applications around it that were essentially going to make it robust. And I thought adding bitcoin and other assets as collateral was going to take it away from what was obviously a vulnerable model into something more robust. But obviously now, looking back, learned a lot of lessons in terms of sort of the cognitive dissonance and a lot of the sort of biases that I was prone to at the time.
01:04:53.802 - 01:05:07.914, Speaker E: And yeah, it was one of the biggest lessons in my life and glad I went through it because I'm definitely a lot more aware now and better off. So, yeah, it's definitely biggest mistake I've made, but, yeah, onwards and upwards.
01:05:08.042 - 01:05:21.780, Speaker A: Couldn't have said it better myself. Onwards and upwards. I was also a terra Luna bull, so I'd be lying if I didn't admit to that. But hey, Westy, we really appreciate having you coming on. Do you mind telling the audience where they can find you?
01:05:22.550 - 01:05:32.022, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely can find me on Twitter at Westy Capital. And then, yeah, you can find my research@blockworksresearch.com. Definitely check it out.
01:05:32.076 - 01:05:33.142, Speaker A: Great. Thanks for coming on.
01:05:33.196 - 01:05:34.086, Speaker E: Appreciate it.
01:05:34.188 - 01:05:42.342, Speaker A: All right, there is a lot to unpack there. Westy just dropped a ton of knowledge on us. Dan, what do you think about Mev as it relates to censorship.
01:05:42.486 - 01:06:19.442, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a great starting point. Really loved how he kind of labeled the relayers as this filtering mechanism, and ultimately that's where this censorship layer resides, it seems. So. It is a little bit concerning to me. Right. I guess I would pose the question to you, why do you think all these block builders are sending or using the same relayer? It makes sense why these relayers are censoring. In my opinion, if they're domiciled in the US or a country that mandates censorship, they don't really have much of a choice if they're an actual company as opposed to this, a non builder style.
01:06:19.442 - 01:06:26.630, Speaker B: But yes, I guess I posed a question to you. Why are the block builders and validators choosing blocks from these relayers?
01:06:27.210 - 01:06:58.702, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it just comes down to what you said where they're actually domiciled. But I do think it's worth highlighting that this is a temporary thing. There is PBS on Ethereum's roadmap. How long that'll take, I don't really know. But we saw builder x 69 kind of open source, a new relay that's open to anyone and no one has to be whitelisted. So I think part of the problem lies in where you're domiciled and then also just getting a more competitive builder and relay market put in place. So that way there's competition amongst all the different sources.
01:06:58.702 - 01:07:05.826, Speaker A: And I think the merge just happened a little over a month ago, so I think that we'll continue to see this decentralize over time.
01:07:06.008 - 01:07:29.526, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's definitely too early to start waving the white flag and admitting to feed on decentralization here. Of course, those are the topics that are going to get thrown around Twitter just because that's what's going to go viral. Right. But I think it's a concerning thing to keep an eye on. But in the current state, it's still a grind towards decentralization, and that's just how we operate in DFI. Right. We have the end goal.
01:07:29.526 - 01:07:33.526, Speaker B: We need to keep that in mind. And it's about building to get to that end goal.
01:07:33.718 - 01:08:10.902, Speaker A: Yeah, 100% agree. And I think almost the more concerning point is the exclusive order flow. It is a little bit scary to think about like a block builder that can skip transactions from the public mem pool and send them directly to themselves, and then all of a sudden they have greater mev opportunity and then they win every bid. That's kind of where I get a little bit more concerned. But I mean, it's still too early to really see how it pans out. And at the same time, if they would do this, it would kind of ruin Ethereum's main value proposition, which is decentralization, which would weaken the value of the chain and then ultimately injure the actors who are involved in this block building process. So economically, the incentives don't really make sense.
01:08:10.902 - 01:08:18.054, Speaker A: But again, I mean, Ethereum, this is a temporary thing, and over the next two years or so, I think the problems will get fixed.
01:08:18.102 - 01:08:45.826, Speaker B: Exclusive order flow is a great, another point to flag. I only expect this to grow over the coming months and years. I think why it's attractive to protocols is, right. If you can capture this mev yourself and then return it to your users, that makes you more attractive to users and. Right, you need to get tracks and you need users. So how are you going to incentivize that? And throwing back rewards to these protocols makes a ton of sense. Now that definitely creates a centralization risk.
01:08:45.826 - 01:09:40.706, Speaker B: Right? Like currently, Manifold has their open mev platform that is doing this through their secure RPC relay, excuse me, their secure RPC platform. And that's where the bottleneck is. Because if they have this super attractive platform that creates this flywheel effect and continues to get more traction, then they are decentralization risk because they have all this power where all this order flow is coming in and it's like feeding off itself, it only gets stronger because they can make better block, more mev filled blocks. So I understand why it's really attractive, but it would be great to see more players populate into this space. But even then, it's only attractive if all these private mem pools have all the private order flow in one spot, right? So I don't know, it's like, how do you build a system around this? It becomes the ultimate question because it seems pretty inevitable.
01:09:40.818 - 01:09:56.570, Speaker A: What do you think about, like, right now it's what, 35% of blocks are vanilla blocks, meaning they're not using Mevboost. So do you think that kind of stays there? Do you think it continues to grow? And do you think that's, like, a threat to Ethereum and its decentralization?
01:09:56.990 - 01:10:36.434, Speaker B: I do think this trends towards a higher participation rate in Mevboost. Right. It becomes down to like, this is a monetary game that we play. Validators have a purpose to make money, and Westy broke down how searchers make money, how block builders make money. Everybody has their incentives here, and blockchains are basically just incentivized games. In the simplest form, it's just a game theory. So I do think we're going to see the push to 100% participation in mev boost solely because you make more money through these blocks that are opting into this network as a threat to decentralization.
01:10:36.434 - 01:11:21.334, Speaker B: Again, this is like, it comes back to that relayer conversation. We just need to see more relays that are permissionless and non censoring to solve this problem. And again, that's where there's the incentive problem, because relays don't inherently profit off this ecosystem. So I think it's just as the mev boost structure grows and matures, then we'll have more participants that are willing to run relays and be block builders and validators. And kind of like, if you have, Wesley kind of highlighted the importance of how a lot of block builders also run a relay, right? Because they can feed blocks from their block builder to their relay. And so that's kind of how the relay then becomes profitable to operate. So I think we'll see more players in this space.
01:11:21.334 - 01:11:35.334, Speaker B: And as you mentioned, builder Zero X 69 is kind of like leading that charge and launched that permissionless relayer. So we'll see if that trend continues. But, yeah, I definitely think we're going to trend towards 100% mev boost.
01:11:35.382 - 01:11:56.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm curious, too, to see how the flashpot solution swab that Westy mentioned actually pans out, because an encrypted public mem pool sounds like a really promising solution to a lot of the problems that we're discussing right now. So that'll definitely be one that I keep a really close eye on. How do you think about Mev on l two s versus eth l one as l two s continue to gain adoption.
01:11:56.910 - 01:12:35.742, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's definitely an interesting topic. My personal view on this is like, all right, let's focus on l ones right now, and let's figure out how to finalize this system before we start worrying about Mev on l two s. Right. There's still a lot of question marks around a whole number of areas around the mev boost platform. As you mentioned, proposer builder separation isn't even officially enshrined within Ethereum yet. So to me, there's like, okay, there's a ton of question marks here, but at the same time, that will be a huge market. As Ethereum begins to scale bull market reheats, we're going to see a ton more users come into crypto, and that's going to push people onto l two s.
01:12:35.742 - 01:12:44.682, Speaker B: So with more transactions occurring on these l two s. Yeah, the mev market there will only expand as these sequencers become decentralized.
01:12:44.746 - 01:13:31.470, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like obviously everyone's talking about MEV on the layer one, but I'm personally really excited about the upcoming narrative of having MeV on L2s because I think Mev and transaction tips are like the perfect way to design a token for an l two, because you can capture that and actually redistribute that to stakers. So that way you're not extracting from Ethereum by making the native token of the l two your gas token like starkware is doing. But instead you can actually return some of that value back to the token holders and give it an actual function. Because right now the op token, for example, it doesn't have very much utility. But I could definitely see a future where, when they actually start to decentralize the process of fraud proofs and their sequencer, I could see that being a really good value proposition for l two tokens, my friend.
01:13:31.540 - 01:13:47.254, Speaker B: That is an excellent take. That's something I've never thought about. I love that idea, because that doesn't take away from you're not like extracting value from the Ethereum base layer and you're just kind of like repurposing this opportunity to drive value to your platform. Wow, love that.
01:13:47.372 - 01:14:01.240, Speaker A: Thanks man, appreciate it. Came up with it on the spot. Anyways, I hope everyone enjoyed this episode of Zero X Research. We will be back here same day next week. We had a lot of fun and we hope you did too. Thanks for tuning in.
