00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.870, Speaker A: That was this design that we came up with years ago. And then at some point along the way, that team abandoned, like the hub development team abandoned it and moved towards this very simplistic, basic version of ics, which is all the hub validators run all these other chains, which is not really, it's not scalable at all. Right? You have to go through a governance proposal to add new chains. You have to. It's really a block size increase. It's not a scalability solution.
00:00:33.530 - 00:01:05.150, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research brought to you by the Atom accelerator. If you're a developer looking for the new home in this industry, the atom Economic zone welcomes you. You'll hear more about the atom accelerator later in the show. Today is July 3, and we have a great interview with Sonny, the founder of Osmosis, a cornerstone of the cosmos ecosystem. We really dove into. Honestly, it was a great discussion around just Dex architecture as a whole. That's really been a hot topic recently in the entire industry.
00:01:05.150 - 00:01:49.454, Speaker B: And the cosmos, in my opinion, has kind of like lacked a lot of that innovation. You have uniswap, kind of pioneering the v three active amm curves really led the way on this passive amm structure, and those are both occurring over in the ethereum ecosystem. But osmosis has really got some very interesting developments under the hood, and it's going to be an exciting few months for them. So really great conversation on why osmosis is building in the direction they're building. But of course, before we get to the interview, we have a little intro segment, this time with rent and westy from the blockworks research team. Before we jump into our typical hot seat cool throne, we got a little governance update for you. So it's a new segment we're trying out.
00:01:49.454 - 00:02:40.490, Speaker B: Be sure to let us know if you're a fan, but DeFi governance is such a happening area, there's always seemingly some crazy thing going on, and this week was no exception. So curve Ave and Bitdao all have some interesting developments. So we'll start with curve wrapped bitcoin and Ethereum are now live as listed in approved collaterals, with the game plan to lower interest rates by 40% on those assets. This kind of comes at a time when there's been a ton of demand already, over 50 million CRV USD borrowed and the wrap bitcoin and just pure native eth were recently listed, but there hasn't been a huge demand for those two assets. And it's really because the interest rates were set a little bit too high. They were kind of more in line with what the liquid staking derivatives are. And the logic is these assets carry less risk.
00:02:40.490 - 00:03:02.470, Speaker B: And to be more competitive with the rest of the market, we're going to have to drop those rates to a lower rate. So excited to kind of see that kick through. That vote was just pushed yesterday on July 2. So on July 9, that will be either approved or denied. Over in Ave, Go is still greenlit for non chain vote. I've said that a few times now. It's pretty interesting.
00:03:02.470 - 00:03:43.566, Speaker B: So Ave companies, which is the original founding company for the protocol of Ave, has created the Go contracts, tested them, gotten them audited and has them ready for delivery. And then ACI is kind of like the third party group that really manages the AavE forums. And a lot of things that happen on the governance side for the AaVE protocol. And the most recent forum post, AavE companies said, hey, we're ready to go. We are fully on board. Now's kind of your last time to make any comments, and that was a couple of weeks ago now. And the ACI just six days ago left another comment on there saying this is greenlit from a technical and governance perspective.
00:03:43.566 - 00:04:25.378, Speaker B: There's no blockers left and it's been that way for a while. At this point, there's really no real reason for this vote not to get pushed on chain. So I've been tracking the deployers and been paying attention to the AAVE governance contract, but still no luck. So really excited to see Go push live, but kind of like sitting in this limbo where we kind of are waiting for AAVE companies to pull the trigger. And then lastly with Bitdao, if you pay any attention to defi governance, Bitdao is always this front runner in level of excitement. Right now they're undergoing a migration from Bitdao to mantle to kind of more organize themselves around their core product, which is mantle, an Ethereum roll up. That is an optimistic roll up.
00:04:25.378 - 00:05:16.654, Speaker B: And interestingly, they will be powered by eigen layers, data availability service. So eigenda, and that's kind of like their core differentiator at this point. And so to kind of get their branding right, they really want to rally around this mantle idea rather than Bitdao and kind of also just kind of really instantiate that this is like a new product. They're doing a one to one token swap from bit to MNT, and the community is currently voting on a proposal that will burn 3 billion tokens of VIt tokens that are sitting and being held by the Dow in response to some community current concerns around a super high FDV for an Ethereum L two. So this would actually decrease their FDV by about one and a half billion dollars, from 4.8 billion to 3.3 billion.
00:05:16.654 - 00:05:34.520, Speaker B: And so the meaning of an FDV has always been an interesting concept. And is FDV a meme has been such a burning question, and there's reasons to think yes and reasons to think no. But Wesley, I'm curious on your thoughts here. Is FDV just a meme, or is it really a metric that we can rely on?
00:05:35.130 - 00:06:43.222, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a good question. I feel like people saying FTV is a meme is more of like a bull run phenomenon when people are thinking sort of in the short term, because obviously it's supply that's going to hit the market at some point in the future. Sure, you should be thinking about it when it comes from a valuation standpoint, but at the same time, I think it's a good point that FTV, not all ftvs are created equal, because like you said in this bit scenario, and I can think of synthetics as a good other alternative. If you have your token, your native token in your treasury, and there are sort of ideas circulating to burn your token, all of a sudden the FTV doesn't matter as much. Whereas FDB may be held by investors or things along those lines where you know that supply cannot get burned and it's going to come unlocked at some point in the future, obviously should be counted. But at the same time, there are also cryptocurrencies that have sort of inflation, where that's not part of the FDB, it's not part of the value that's currently circulating, or rather not circulating, but exists, and rather has emissions in the future. And so there are ways in which sort of FTV doesn't really exist, but also kind of does exist.
00:06:43.222 - 00:06:47.518, Speaker C: So it's definitely a more nuanced subject, I think.
00:06:47.604 - 00:07:39.360, Speaker D: One thing I will add there is that you saw a lot of DFI tokens, or deFI protocols, to be more accurate, have really high emissions during the bull run. And then throughout the past year, they realized that all of those emissions aren't doing any good for the protocol. So, for example, ribbon has decreased their emissions by 50%, marinade has decreased their emissions by 75%, and theoretically that total supply still exists, but your emissions have been greatly reduced. Right? So at that point, do you still think about the FDB as the full FDB? Or maybe the FDB should be compressed a little because that emissions that originally existed probably isn't going to hit the market anytime soon. But then also, for example, with what happened with know these things can change at a whim, which is why it's so important to keep track of all of these governance updates and use a great product such as scuff to do so.
00:07:40.370 - 00:08:02.898, Speaker B: The shameless plug. Well done, red. We love to hear that. But yeah, no, I think westy hit the nail on the head there. I think the reality is not all fdbs are created equal. And as much as we want to draw parallels from protocol a to protocol b, the reality is it's just too hard to do that in almost every situation. So TradFi has EBITDA earnings before interest in taxes.
00:08:02.898 - 00:08:32.746, Speaker B: And that's really interesting because it's like this one number you can compare very much. So compare between companies in the same sector and even still to some extent any two given companies and kind of determine that profitability metric. And that's something we're really still chasing, not only on the token level, but even on a profitability and income statement level. So it's just funny to see we still have so much work to do in so many different directions. But that's why it's exciting. Let's kick things over to the hot seat. Cool throw.
00:08:32.746 - 00:08:35.298, Speaker B: And maybe Ren, I'll throw it to you first. Who you got this week?
00:08:35.464 - 00:08:57.218, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. I got Azuki on the hot seat this week. So Azuki was a really popular NFC collection. During the poo run. They raised around, I think 40 million during their first collection. Last week, they announced and raised for a new collection called Elementals. So they sold 20,000 nfts in total for this collection.
00:08:57.218 - 00:09:43.330, Speaker D: 10,000 of these nfts were airdropped to people that attended their in person Las Vegas event. And then the other 10,000 were sold via dutch auction to Azuki orders during a ten minute presale and then to binza orders during another ten minute presale window. They entirely sold out. They raised 20,000 leave roughly $38 million. But then afterwards, people realized that these nfts weren't as hyped up as they were meant to be for a few reasons. First of all, there were nfts in this new collection that basically looked exactly the same as the previous collection, which obviously is no no for an NFT. And then, for example, there were other people that were annoyed that Azuki holders got a head start versus other holders.
00:09:43.330 - 00:10:17.822, Speaker D: And so the TLDR is that the community is mad. They're fuming, right? And that was shown in the floor price. The floor price of Azuki went down by 50% over the weekend. And Azuki Dow, which is made up by a bunch of oG Azuki holders, basically filed a lawsuit saying, hey, we want to call that 20,000 e back and it should be used for something else. It shouldn't go to the teeth. It should at least be used for community development and rewards. Obviously, Azuki had to sort of tackle this pr disaster in the fact that for some people, their NFD supply doubled overnight.
00:10:17.886 - 00:10:18.066, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:18.088 - 00:10:32.360, Speaker D: And it's fair that surf price of the NFD goes down by 50%. And so they're doing a few things. They're creating an anime series. They're going to update some of the background artwork. But it just seems like a very low effort attempt by NFT collection to raise more cash.
00:10:34.810 - 00:11:13.700, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely agree with that take. And what I think is interesting, like you said, the artwork is basically exactly the same as the original collection. So you can see why the floor price of azukis themselves dropped because it basically diluted the supply by double. But at the same time, this is sort of like a catalyst for the entire NFT market and the entire NFT community to just capitulate. Like floor prices, if you scroll on blur, are just all down like 30% the past couple of days as a result of this. And I'm not sure why this specifically caused that. Maybe people are starting to realize maybe their jpegs don't have as much intrinsic value as they thought they did.
00:11:13.700 - 00:11:38.714, Speaker C: But I think, yeah, it's been a super interesting event as a whole. And I wonder, is this a good time? Let's say you're bullish on Azuki's or maybe a similar NFT. Is this the point where you sort of get back in the market as a lot of these holders are capitulating? Or maybe are you waiting sort of for a new around of nfts and sort of the next bull market that don't have sort of like a clean slate? So, yeah, I'm wondering what you guys think.
00:11:38.912 - 00:12:35.294, Speaker B: Well, the fact that I think we'd all probably agree that this is a sign NFTs are truly dying probably makes it a great time to go long, if that's what you're into. And of course not financial advice. But for me, it's like, what did Azuki holders really expect out of this? When you have an NFT that just airdrops you more nfts this is like the inevitable death circle. What is the team supposed to do? Okay, would you really be happy if the artwork looked better or if it was like a different style picture? Would you really not be sitting here complaining? In some ways it's like the reality is you're just slowly becoming to the realization that PFP NFTs are probably dead. Nfts as art are definitely not dead. The goose, the art blocks, those will continue to be a thing and very much so. Like royalty art and high end art, luxury art, that is definitely a thing.
00:12:35.294 - 00:13:16.342, Speaker B: And putting it on chain makes it a little bit more interesting. Nfts as a technology is absolutely not dead. We're scratched the surface on what that will know. I always use the example of the interchange scheduler that the cosmos ecosystem was going to implement. And the idea of tokenizing block space using nfts makes a ton of sense. Every block is non fungible with the other block and having the rights to order the transactions in that block is a very interesting use case of nfts. But for me it's like, what are we doing here? I don't know if it's a hot take or not, but I really don't think we're going to see the same congregation of attention around PFP nfts in the next cycle.
00:13:16.342 - 00:13:41.460, Speaker B: I'm sure there will be something else, but I just don't think it'll be nfts. And I'm happy for the service they played and the role that they played in the last bull run, bringing people on chain and kind of being that first reason for regular old joes to come on chain and interact with a blockchain. But yeah, just can't see a world where those are really as important as they are made out to be.
00:13:41.910 - 00:14:12.350, Speaker D: I just thought it's kind of funny that we're talking about is FTP a meme during the Bitdao discussion just now. And we're know Bitdao can just decrease the bit FTP by 3 billion overnight. Joy Governance vote and Azuki kind of did the same thing. They're just like, okay, I'm just going to double supply FTP of my NFT collection as I'll become a meme. And that reflected in the market prices. Just as an interesting dynamics between sort of like fungible tokens and what are meant to be non fungible tokens.
00:14:13.730 - 00:14:37.218, Speaker B: It's also just wild to me that that team just printed $38 million at a thin air off this. Props to them. They're just doing what they were asked to do. And, yeah, I don't know. I guess this kind of got away from the original idea of what should happen with the $38 million. Does anyone have a take on if that should be clawed back or if just kind of fair game?
00:14:37.304 - 00:15:17.300, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a little bit scummy to sort of not reveal that the art is exactly the same, but at the same time, as a holder, you have no, I guess, obligation to buy these new nfts for most of the people. Like 10,000 of the 20,000 was airdropped to people at their event, so it was free to them. So overall, I think, yeah, they're entitled to that money, but at the same time they do so at the result of their reputation being damaged. So I don't think they're going to be able to raise as much, if not even close to that much money in the future. And so I just think that's sort of where they lose out. I don't think the fund should be called back.
00:15:17.830 - 00:16:07.860, Speaker D: I feel like there's a pretty fair legal case, if someone really wanted to pursue it, that what they were offering was a new collection, and you could just go to a court of law and say, hey, these many images of the new collection are exactly the same as these many images of the old collection. All of your marketing materials say that this is going to be like a new collection. God forbid they say new artwork or new background, new colors in their sort of teaser for this new elemental collection. And so I feel like there is actually partially a case out there because there's a lot of times where, for example, someone does product marketing, they put slightly misleading statements and those do hold up in the know. Someone goes like, hey, your product promised that it would do this, but it didn't. And there's like a pretty big industry around that, actually.
00:16:09.590 - 00:16:14.340, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a fair point there. Ren Wesley, who do you got in the hot seat or cool Throne this week?
00:16:14.870 - 00:16:21.126, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely not a zero x research episode without putting Coinbase in the cool throne. So I had to do it this week.
00:16:21.228 - 00:16:23.494, Speaker B: Had to do it, had to do it.
00:16:23.612 - 00:17:28.406, Speaker C: David is definitely going to have a smile on his face watching this back. Yeah, they could have easily been in the hot seat, though, after the news last Friday that said that the ETF applications of recent, such as the one from Blackrock, were deemed inefficient by the SEC. And so at the time, it caused the price of Coin and BTC to dump in the hours following. But some people were able to catch that. The reason that they were deemed inefficient was because the applications just didn't specify the crypto marketplace that they were using, because they would need to also enter under the surveillance sharing agreement that the SEC was looking for. And so, like clockwork, almost all the ETF applications of recent, such as fidelity, wisdom Tree, Vanek, Galaxy, and Ark, I think, were all of them, all listed Coinbase immediately as their selected exchange. And so obviously, that's super bullish for Coinbase as a whole, because if one or more of these etfs were to be accepted, Coinbase would be the exchange of choice.
00:17:28.406 - 00:17:50.210, Speaker C: And there's sort of a delayed reaction where it was like, on Friday, we didn't really see a bump after people figured this out. But as of today and Monday, July 3, coin is up like 12% on the day, 11% to 12%, which I think is people sort of digesting that news and, yeah, I mean, just another great week for Coinbase overall.
00:17:51.670 - 00:18:43.810, Speaker B: Yeah, this was an interesting one. And I don't know, I have zero information on the success, the likelihood of success for the slew of ets we've seen come through. I tend to lean towards the camp of, we saw this second round, and I'd like to think that Blackrock knew something. And even if the other firms didn't know anything, they knew that Blackrock knew something. But at the same time, it's like everyone is now listing the exchange that the SEC is actively suing to get approval from the SEC on their ETF application. So I don't know, it just feels so weird, and I want to be bullish about it, but it's tough because that right there, if you just took that sentence out of context, it would make no sense that these etfs would be getting approved.
00:18:44.870 - 00:20:05.058, Speaker D: Yeah, I think a few other interesting implications of this is that, for example, is anyone going to come out and there's like a spot ETF and then just a bit more on the surveillance sharing agreement? So that's basically talking about the fact that a spot ETF needs an exchange with kind of sufficient liquidity so that a manipulator would have to trade on that market to manipulate the spot price of that token. And a surveillance sharing agreement kind of says, okay, if there is any market manipulation occurring, then one thing we're going to need to do is going to share that trade data, like, see who's manipulating the spot price so you can pursue any legal action. I think one thing that I think about is that if someone creates a spot token ETF with where the most liquidity is on chain, right. On a decentralized exchange, whether that's like curve unisoft or freshly curve, or state thief. Right. How does the surveillance sharing agreement work? Or is it just not ever possible to list a spot ETF? Because, say a Dex has like 70% of the trade volume and liquidity, whereas the largest centralized exchange has 30% of the liquidity. Then price discovery will likely happen on the decks.
00:20:05.058 - 00:20:18.450, Speaker D: Right, but how do you do a surveillance sharing agreement with a Dex? And I think that's something that we don't have to think about yet, because we're just not that big of an asset class yet. But it's probably a question that someone will have to think about sooner or later down the road.
00:20:18.520 - 00:20:57.774, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely a really good point. Another thing along these lines when talking about the ETFs is I'm hearing a lot of rumors, sort of on many different sides about how this is going to play out. Like no one really has a clear roadmap. I'm hearing from some people that the ETF could be approved as early as August. Mary, some people say that this is strictly a political move from Larry Fink, that sort of the timing of when this application is up in February sort of time as well, with a lot of the presidential debates and whatnot. And so there's a lot of different sides of whether this will be approved. This won't what the timeline looks like.
00:20:57.774 - 00:21:05.822, Speaker C: And so there's just a lot up in the air that we really don't know. So while this could be bullish for Coinbase, if they get approved, that's sort of still a big if.
00:21:05.876 - 00:21:47.998, Speaker B: Yeah. And speaking of timelines, there's actually a red and flag. This picture to me not too long ago. I only have a screenshot of this, but we'll figure out a way to get it in the show notes for you guys. But it's actually following the lifecycle of the iShares bitcoin ETF, which is the blackrock ETF. So the first major landmark will come through regards to its approval or deny being denied will be on the twelveth of August. So at that point, the SEC has the ability to approve, deny, or extend the proposal for another 45 days, and then 45 days later will be September 26, in which they can either approve, deny, or extend for 90 days.
00:21:47.998 - 00:22:46.218, Speaker B: And then that would give them a third deadline to approve, deny, or extend for 60 days in December. And so generally what we've seen happen is on all three of those deadline dates, the application will get extended in each period, which brings us to the fourth and final deadline day, which would actually be on the 23 February, 2024. And so at this point, the SEC would have to make a final call on either approving or denying the ETF, which is the expected date. And I'm not a huge political person, but I do believe that February is a pretty big month for, I think it's the primary elections. So that's an interesting time there, making the SEC kind of come out and take a huge stance on this during this very political point in time. And more importantly, in my mind, the next bitcoin habiting occurs roughly around the 25 March. So roughly one month out, we're going to have potentially an approved ETF.
00:22:46.218 - 00:23:32.590, Speaker B: And the bitcoin habiting, which anyone who's spending time in this industry knows very well, that we tend to get the bullish wave kick off right around that next halving period. So the stars could very well be aligning here. But I'll jump things over into my hot seat cool throne this week, which is the last one of the week. And I have compound. So we recently got the announcement of Robert Lesner's new product, Superstate. And so Superstate aims to create this regulated financial product that bridges traditional markets and blockchain ecosystems. And their first product is going to be this fund that holds short term government bonds, specifically SeC approved.
00:23:32.590 - 00:24:37.122, Speaker B: So like basically combining the tradflight world with the on chain world. And it definitely will need to be KYC approved as well as kind of have this US based focus for US investors. And the tokens themselves will likely not be transferable. So the initial reaction there is kind of like, okay, well, what's the point? But this very much to me feels like this step one of just bringing traditional markets on chain, we clearly have improved efficiencies, near instant settlement, and very cheap transactions that really, over the long term, traditional markets, likely won't be able to compete with. But it's also this kind of like middle ground of, is this the next step to kind of bring these off chain yields on chain and find a way to incorporate them into, you know, I'd like to think the answer there is yes. So superstate is really trying to be this first, you know, on chain way to hold essentially government t bombs. So pretty exciting development there.
00:24:37.122 - 00:25:22.398, Speaker B: However, it gets bearish for comp holders, as Robert Lesner has stepped down as the compound labs CEO and actually made way for Jason Hobby, who's been with compound labs for over three years now. So definitely someone who knows the grounds, knows how the protocol works, knows the ins and outs, and kind of been learning alongside Lescher for this entire time. And Lescher hasn't officially stepped down until now, but he's kind of seems know been paying attention to more different areas. I know he does a lot with robo Ventures and really just hasn't been too focused on compound. So maybe in that regard it is bullish for them. Like, hey, we've got a new CEO looking over our protocol and kind of helping push things in the right directions. But for a long time it's felt like compound has really been losing the battle to Ave.
00:25:22.398 - 00:26:23.574, Speaker B: And if you look at borrowed outstanding assets deposited now at the launch, they did successfully launch their v three, but without the native stablecoin, this really hurts the revenue potential of the protocol. And there's really no connection to how superstate will benefit or just be totally separate from compound itself, which I think is most interesting, because if you look at the token price, somebody definitely knew this was coming, because the token started absolutely screaming a couple of days before the SEC's filings were even made public. So the SEC filings went through on the June 26. The tokens started absolutely moving on the 24th from the June lows to the peak highs. During its run, it was actually a 200% move, and the rest of the market moved a fraction of that. So definitely seemed like somebody new had some privy information here, given that compound has been down only for quite some time. So I hate to see that.
00:26:23.574 - 00:26:43.200, Speaker B: Honestly, we really need to be avoiding things like that. But nonetheless, somebody believes quite confidently that there will be a connection between superstated compound, or maybe there was just a trade that they had some information on, like, okay, we'll be attention to a flow to compound, so let me get there first. Hard to say, but definitely some speculators in the water on this one.
00:26:44.050 - 00:27:41.150, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's an interesting move that they're starting with this, considering there's a few other protocols that are already providing treasury yields on chain, perhaps in a less permissioned manner, such as on the finance and a few others that I'm blanking on. I think one thing I like to point out is that CDFI, like the mix or the intersection of centralized finance and decentralized finance, gets a bad rep. Like a lot of people out there is like, guys, no, if you want to do d five, it has to be entirely decentralized. We're not doing this CDFI BS, but I actually think much of the future is probably going to be CDFI if anything. If I had to put a number to it, probably 90% of the value on chain is going to be CD. There's like a lot of money out there from ultra high net worth individuals, family offices, pension funds that are chasing yields and investment opportunities of different forms. Right? And bringing it on chain enables two things.
00:27:41.150 - 00:28:10.070, Speaker D: One, sort of enabling the opportunity to be accessible in the first place. Because, for example, I don't know, you're in Australia and you want to buy something in Canada, you're probably not going to buy the Canada to sign something in person. Whereas putting it on chain makes it a lot more accessible. And two, it makes it sort of like, it decreases the cost of processing those transactions. DeFi is all about removing the middleman. And putting it on chain does bring up that opportunity. And there is a lot of money chasing a lot of different opportunities.
00:28:10.070 - 00:29:00.470, Speaker D: There's family offices worth like hundreds of billions of dollars. They're spending their entire day looking for the most random investment opportunities, whether that's real estate, adventure bonds. And if you put that all in one place on chain in a transparent manner, that's still a lot of bad for a lot of these people. Even if you think about, for example, your exchanges such as Avo, you would think of Avo as like options decks, but in reality, their matching engine runs off chain. Probably 99% of the liquidity is provided by centralized market makers, probably like two or three, maybe five. And I don't think it's a bad thing that they're centralized. I still get access to those type of opportunities on chain, whereas in a completely alternate world, I wouldn't even have access to those opportunities.
00:29:02.170 - 00:30:05.518, Speaker C: Yeah, the way I see this has like a bootstrapping mechanism. I know a lot of other RWA protocols are doing something similar where they're using us treasuries. And the fact that they have high yield, given how high rates are currently, and using that to sort of bridge the gap between traditional investors and sort of defi itself. And so while things may begin permissions and begin with treasuries only, I think it's probably going to expand from there. Maybe having more permission pools for different RWA devices, then eventually getting their way to more like permissionless, open types of products. But this is sort of the necessary first step, because no other RWA product is probably going to do the kind of impact that treasuries will, because treasury yields are higher than a lot of defi yields at the moment. And I agree with you, Ren, that it's sort of like a necessary, quote, unquote evil, although I wouldn't really call it that.
00:30:05.518 - 00:30:30.870, Speaker C: And that permission DeFi is going to happen whether you want it to or not. I guess the question is how it happens. Maybe we develop things beyond KYC that are maybe more improved, that use CK proofs to sort of prove identity and whatnot. But over time, yeah, I think that's going to be a growing sector of the market and it's something you're going to have to pay attention to as it grows.
00:30:31.370 - 00:31:12.066, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm with you on that. And thinking this back to compound, they had something called compound treasury for a while there, right after they launched their v three, I want to say, and I'm not sure if that got killed off or not, but definitely never got a meaningful amount of traction. And so I think Leschner was pretty excited about that. So my guess now is this is superstate is kind of like the reincarnated version of compound treasury. Really being that institutional borrow and space that kind of helps bridge the gap between tradfi and being on chain. So that's kind of where my head's at with this. But it'd be exciting to see if anything does develop and there is any rekindling of a connection with compound, but that'll be it for us.
00:31:12.066 - 00:32:00.882, Speaker B: Guys, we'll get you over to the interview with Sonny from osmosis. Again, super exciting conversation around really just what it is to build a Dex. And how do you kind of shift things back in favor of lps and really get profitability flowing their way? But before we jump over to that interview, I want to give a quick shout out to the Atom accelerator for sponsoring our show. And again, if you're a developer looking to build an awesome product that has real economic value, or can just in general bring benefit to an ecosystem, the atom economic zone is looking to help you build. Currently, the accelerator is giving out grants in batches of $10,000 to $1 million on a rolling monthly basis, and they're super passionate about building up the ecosystem. And so interchange security means you can launch with the security of the cosmos. Hub itself.
00:32:00.882 - 00:32:48.718, Speaker B: Powered by atom, IBC gives you the flexibility of interoperability and in combination with interchange accounts, gives you this seamless cross chain ability to transact. And it truly is becoming quite seamless. And Stride really can show you what that is with their one click deposits. And again, Stride is helping push out the advancement of lsts, which improves Defi, alongside noble bringing in native USDC. And most more recently, we have duality, kind of setting the standard on what value accrual should look like when it comes to making a deal for the Cosmos hub via interchange security? So again, if you're a developer looking to build a project and kind of needing that first kickstart, again, be sure to reach out to the admin accelerator. We will put their link in the show notes. Now onto the interview with Sonny from osmosis.
00:32:48.814 - 00:32:58.674, Speaker E: All right, we are joined with a guest who obviously needs no introduction, Sonny from osmosis. Thanks for coming on, Sonny. How'd the hackathon go over with Delphi?
00:32:58.802 - 00:33:10.490, Speaker A: It went really well. It was not like one of those two. It was like a month long online one, but really happy with the result.
00:33:10.560 - 00:33:33.218, Speaker E: I'm glad to hear that the enthusiasm, despite the bear market amongst Cosmos builders, is still robust. It's always good to hear, but I did want to obviously hop into osmosis here. There's been a ton of different changes, but before we did that, I was hoping you could just give a quick 32nd elevator pitch. What is osmosis? How has it been since Genesis launch? Would you define it as a success and I guess kind of like, what are the goals going forward?
00:33:33.304 - 00:34:20.062, Speaker A: Yeah. So osmosis is a decentralized exchange, but what makes it unique? It is a decentralized exchange built as its own app chain. So instead of being built on top of Ethereum or EVM or l two s, it's its own chain for the purpose of being the best Dex possible. Because what we realized was, when we were trying to design how to build a Dex, we realized most of the limitations come from the constraints that the chain puts on you. If you want to build stuff around privacy, you need to add new cryptographic primitives. If you want to do things around ux of how fees work, you need to go change how the mempool works. If you want to do stuff with mev mitigation, you have to go also change how the mempool works.
00:34:20.062 - 00:34:59.338, Speaker A: And so there was all these things where we thought that, okay, where the next innovation is really going to come to make dexes and defi usable, especially for privacy and ux side comes from building your own chain. So that's what we did. It launched about two years ago. Last week was or two weeks ago was the two year anniversary of osmosis. And in that time, it's been a lot of ups and downs, both. If we're talking about price or liquidity and usage. I would say overall osmosis definitely has been a success.
00:34:59.338 - 00:35:36.600, Speaker A: And part of the goal there was to help bootstrap the cosmos ecosystem. And so we kind of helped did that because that's the stack that we're built on. And so we became the largest decks in the cosmos ecosystem. There was a few competitors and still are today, but the lion's share of volume and liquidity is on osmosis. We were the biggest Dex for UST, which worked really great for us for a long time. We were growing like crazy, a lot of liquidity. And then, obviously, that all vanished into thin air.
00:35:36.600 - 00:36:08.050, Speaker A: But at the same time, the whole terra explosion kind of, I call it the supernova, because it exploded, but it sent stardust throughout the cosmos. And so a lot of the builders and users and stuff who maybe got onboarded through terra have found a new home throughout cosmos, many of them building on top of osmosis and building this ecosystem of applications around the osmosis decks.
00:36:09.350 - 00:36:09.810, Speaker C: Nice.
00:36:09.880 - 00:36:20.946, Speaker E: That actually set me up perfectly for this segue here. The carbon upgrade from 2022 enabled Cosmosm smart contracts on osmosis. And I believe Mars has been the first protocol to utilize that and launch.
00:36:20.978 - 00:36:22.370, Speaker B: On osmosis as an outpost.
00:36:22.450 - 00:36:25.000, Speaker E: So how has that gone so far? Have you been happy with.
00:36:26.810 - 00:37:06.100, Speaker A: We, what we realized basically was, what are we trying to build with osmosis is like, build a platform that is comparable to what you see on a centralized exchange. And we've been mostly focused on the decks, like, really the trading engine for spot trading. Right. But if you go on a centralized exchange site, the spot trading is one aspect of it. Right. They also do other things like margin trading, perps, launch pads, fiat on ramps. You have this ecosystem of things that are all packaged into one unified experience.
00:37:06.100 - 00:37:52.354, Speaker A: And so what I thought was, originally, we were trying to build all of that in house. We were building our own lending protocol in order to do margin trading. We were working on our own launch pad. But then what we realized is like, okay, we were actually kind of spreading ourselves quite thin there. And so what we realized is, hey, instead of us trying to build everything in house, why don't we make a system where we can work with other teams to build these necessary components? And as I mentioned, it just happened to come right around the same time as the terra debacle. And so you had suddenly had a lot of teams with a lot of cosmosm development experience, were looking for a new home. And so, basically, we were.
00:37:52.354 - 00:38:32.430, Speaker A: So Mars is this project built by Delphi Labs. And so they were building a lending protocol that they migrated to osmosis. And now you can do, borrow, lend on osmosis. But the real goal here is to build a proper margin trading experience, which is what they're working on right now. Then you also have projects like Labana and OMX. OMX was one of the other del by hackathon winners, and then Labana came from Terra, but they're both building GMX style purpose protocols. You have, like IBCX, which is a index token for the cosmos ecosystem.
00:38:32.430 - 00:39:16.238, Speaker A: You have people built calc, who's built DCA tooling. You have streamswap, which is this launch pad that we originally started building in house, but that we just sort of handed off to another team to run with. And so, yeah, now we have all these components that you imagine expect to see in a fully functional exchange. You're now able to start accessing them all on the osmosis chain. And on the website for osmosis, now we have this App Store where you can access all of these different tools as well. And then the goal is right now, when you click on them, it kicks you off onto a different site. You go onto the calc site or you go onto the Labana site.
00:39:16.238 - 00:39:21.738, Speaker A: But the end goal here is to have them all eventually integrated into one UX.
00:39:21.834 - 00:39:46.966, Speaker B: Oh, that's awesome. I love to see all the pieces kind of falling in place right there. That's honestly really exciting to see. That's the beauty of an app chain, is to be able to recreate that off chain like experience and building a chain specifically tailored to your needs. One of the other questions I had related to this was the hot thing to do these days is build your own decentralized stablecoin. Any plans there? I think there's a team. Membrane finance, if I remember correctly, is doing something similar to this.
00:39:47.068 - 00:40:34.466, Speaker A: Yep. So membrane. Also a post Xterra team, but they are building a multi. They're taking sort of some ideas from a bunch of different existing stablecoins and combining them into one. So they take a lot of inspiration. So they're a multicolateral, over collateralized stablecoin, and they follow more of a reflexor rye type of thing, where instead of taking the DAI approach and having a PSM, which eventually leads you to be mostly like, centralized, stablecoin backed, they are instead making it so it has a free floating exchange rate. But unlike Rye, which is only single collateral with ETH, this is going to be multi collateral.
00:40:34.466 - 00:41:00.720, Speaker A: So you're able to use atom, osmo, eth, bitcoin, all these different assets in order to do this. And then they'll also offer systems like LUSD for direct redemptions. So even though it does have a floating rate like Rye, the LUSD system direct redemptions will help it maintain the peg a little bit more strongly than you would with.
00:41:02.610 - 00:41:03.178, Speaker B: There.
00:41:03.284 - 00:41:41.130, Speaker A: It's definitely a little bit of a radical take, like their whole rye free floating exchange rate. It's TBD how that fares with users long term. Right. Because I think long term it is the necessary right thing to do. I saw this interesting graph the other day of showed that over the course of the last two years, Rye has actually more closely tracked the US dollar than most major FX assets. So it's better tracked the dollar than the euro, than the swiss franc, than the pound. And so it's actually pretty good as a store of value, all things considered.
00:41:41.130 - 00:42:16.182, Speaker A: And I think that's the end goal here. We should be building crypto native units of accounts. So, yeah, I'm really excited for that with membrane. And then I've also been chatting with the membrane team about potentially reusing their contracts. So one of the things that they do also, that's different than how DAi does it. In Dai, even though it is multicolateral, every CDP is single collateral. So you can have an ETH CDP and then you can have a WBTC CDP, but they both have their own independent liquidation points.
00:42:16.182 - 00:43:16.774, Speaker A: With the membrane design, all your assets are in a single vault, and so that way you don't have to have different liquidation points for every individual asset. They all follow us. Even if, let's say, your eth goes down in value, but the bitcoin goes up, it's fine, because they're all working on a single CDP. That's one of the cool things that they've done. And so what I was mentioning was we're discussing with them about reusing the contracts to launch a second stablecoin called bitdollar, which is going to be a bitcoin only backed stablecoin. So just like, I think the multicolateral stablecoin has some usages, but I think there's also an experiment where we want to run of like, hey, what if we had just how you have a lot of stablecoins in Ethereum ecosystem that are only backed by eTh, and there is a demand for those. We want to see what kind of demand we can drive for a stablecoin that's only backed by bitcoin.
00:43:16.774 - 00:43:17.178, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:43:17.264 - 00:43:43.246, Speaker E: I love how everyone in the cosmos ecosystem seems to have a soft spot for bitcoin. That's one of my favorite parts, honestly. But I did want to dive in a bit into the Proto rev module I actually don't understand this super well at all, but I did read effort Capital's latest blockworks research report, and he said that you guys had generated about one hundred k of revenue since launching that, I think, in early April. Can you kind of explain to the listeners what exactly that is and what the integration entails?
00:43:43.438 - 00:45:14.034, Speaker A: Yeah, so Protorev is the first of a couple of products that we're building around MeV in osmosis. And our take on Mev in general is we kind of split it into harmful and benign Mev. Harmful Mev is the type where you are reading other people's transactions before they're executed and acting upon them. So basically that would include things like front running or sandwiching and stuff. Then there's the benign meV, where it's what you do based not off of reading other people's transactions, but just like, let's say you're doing an arbitrage, you're arbing a centralized exchange, arbing prices on the decks to prices on external markets, and no one's really getting harmed there. And so that's kind of what we want to encourage. Instead of leaking all of that value to external arbors, how can we capture as much of that value into the protocol itself? So Protorev is the first one of these products where what it does is it backruns users, where you can imagine that there's like multiple pools on the decks where, let's say there's a way someone wanted to trade USDC for OsMo, right? The thing is, there might be multiple pool routes by which to do that.
00:45:14.034 - 00:45:22.830, Speaker A: There's a direct USDC to OsMo pool, but then there's also a pool that you can maybe swap USDC for Atom and then Atom for Osmo.
00:45:22.910 - 00:45:23.540, Speaker B: And.
00:45:25.350 - 00:46:20.998, Speaker A: We encourage people to use good routers that try to split correctly. But at the end of the day, it's not always possible to split perfectly just because of you don't know what the state of the blockchain is when you execute the transaction. So normally what happens is there's a lot of backrunning happening where people would be like spamming transactions, trying to background people and arb the pools. What we realized is, hey, why doesn't the protocol just do this itself? So instead of being spammed by people trying to backrun, we can just have it. After anyone does a swap, the blockchain code by itself looks for certain cyclical arbs and executes them, and then takes the revenue from those executions and gives it to, well, the governor's proposal for what to do with the earned revenue is up for vote right now.
00:46:21.164 - 00:46:24.418, Speaker B: What's your insights like? What do you think is the best use of that revenue?
00:46:24.514 - 00:46:55.114, Speaker A: I think probably a combination of, I would say majority should just be distributed to stakers, because I think osmosis currently mostly been, it has pretty high inflationary yields in order to incentivize staking. But the goal here is to switch towards real yield. Right. Similarly, the governance just voted for the activation of a fee switch where basically start charging taker fees on the exchange that go to the protocol.
00:46:55.242 - 00:47:10.402, Speaker B: Yeah, let's dive into that fee switch there as well, because my understanding is this is an additional fee on top of the current swap fee that specifically goes to the protocol. So what was the idea that was really the driving force behind this decision to add this additional fee?
00:47:10.466 - 00:47:53.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the driving force is that at the end of the day, the Osmosis protocol needs to be self sustainable. And up till today it was mostly driven off of inflationary rewards, but as part of OsmO 2.0, which we will talk about. But basically inflation needs to go down. Right. It was a good growth hack, but at some point, like any business, osmosis as a protocol needs to be self sustainable and it needs some source of revenue, and the primary source of revenue for any exchange centralized or decentralized. At the end of the day, we have them, Mev revenues as well as a second source.
00:47:53.934 - 00:48:35.074, Speaker A: But at the end of the day, the trading fees are sort of the primary bread and butter for any exchange. And so we're two years in and I think government decided it was time to start activating, start charging a taker fee. And it works well because like you mentioned, it is an additional fee on top of the LP fees. I actually don't really like the term LP fees, to be honest. We're actually changed in the code. We went ahead and changed all of them to be called spread factors because that's really, if you think about it, that's what it is. When you set in a pool, what is an amm? It's people market making at a certain price.
00:48:35.074 - 00:49:17.520, Speaker A: And when you're market making, you set a certain spread, the difference between the highest buy and bid and ask. Right. And so basically the spread factor is basically the automated market maker, it's what spread they're market making at. So it is an additional fee on top of the spread factor of each pool. But we expect that most liquidity is going to start to migrate towards thinner spread factors with concentrated liquidity, because now you're going to be able to concentrate. And you see this happen on uniswap for most pairs where more active market makers will start to come in and basically start to quote at smaller spreads. And then there's also cool way.
00:49:17.520 - 00:49:51.958, Speaker A: It's funny that once you have a protocol fee, now you can start to build in mechanisms of reducing the protocol fee. It's kind of funny now you look at a lot of exchanges, do things like affiliate referral links, you can do things like, oh, the more Osmo you have staked, your protocol fees can go down, you can decrease based off of trading volume. That's a common thing that most centralized exchanges do. So now that there's a stick that's involved, now you can start to use it as a carrot as well to incentivize certain behaviors from traders.
00:49:52.054 - 00:50:36.066, Speaker B: So one of the things that between the proto red module and the allocation of what to do with that revenue, and then with the inclusion of the additional fee here, the taker fee, I'm starting to get the sense that I guess a difference between osmosis and let's say uniswap, for example, is osmosis has the extra factor of having stakers, and they need to take care of that party and make sure that they're incentivized to contribute, doing their work. I really like the work you're doing and trying to get that towards this more real yield side of things where it's not just inflationary rewards. But I'm curious, how do you think about the trade off as well? Because you almost need both parties equally. Without liquidity you don't have a Dex, and without stakers and validators, you don't have an amp chain.
00:50:36.098 - 00:50:36.838, Speaker A: So how do you think about the.
00:50:36.844 - 00:50:38.226, Speaker B: Dynamics at play there?
00:50:38.348 - 00:51:26.310, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think it's not like incentives are going away for liquidity providers. Part of Osmond 3.0, all it did was shift more of the incentives towards stakers. There's still a significant portion of inflation goes towards our daily issuance, goes towards lps. And the thing is, with concentrated liquidity, like Unisoft v three style contract liquidity, you just really don't need the same amount of capital in order to provide the same liquidity. At the end of the day, you're trying to provide the users with a certain level of price impact when they make trades. And with contra liquidity, you can get away with significantly a magnitude less of liquidity and still get the same user experience.
00:51:26.310 - 00:51:44.890, Speaker A: And so that's the idea where we can drive down incentives because we just don't fundamentally need as much capital, and that capital in the osmosis ecosystem can be directed towards other things being lent out on things like Mars or being staking to help secure the protocol.
00:51:44.970 - 00:52:33.280, Speaker B: Okay. I like the breakdown there as well, because it's kind of become the hot topic recently to realizing that LP just seems to be negative. Ev, whether you're using IL impermanent loss or LBR loss versus rebalancing or like a markout strategy as the common thing to do in traditional market making, and that's just kind of what every different angle of people are coming at it from that. The results just show that being an LP is kind of taking the short end of the stick. So how do you think about that? You see univ four come out ambient, and now you guys are using this uniswap v three model as kind of like this active market making. Do you think that that's really the future and more of that, the traditional XYK or even something like a curve v two, that's passive concentrated liquidity. Do you think the future of Amms is really just this more active design?
00:52:33.970 - 00:53:01.480, Speaker A: I definitely think it is the more active design. I think it depends on the stage of the market. Right. So our take has always been amms are really good for bootstrapping new ecosystems, bootstrapping new assets. And for the last two years, that's what we've been doing, is helping bootstrap cosmos. I think now Cosmos is getting mature enough. There's enough high cap assets that we need something more capital efficient than what we had before.
00:53:01.480 - 00:53:27.246, Speaker A: And so I hope you mentioned curve V two, because I still do believe that passive strategies are good, but I think the passive strategies need to still be smarter than just XYK. And so astroport, for example, is building a. There's actually a number of teams sort of building market making Amm vaults. They call them Amm because that's what they are.
00:53:27.268 - 00:53:27.406, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:27.428 - 00:54:11.740, Speaker A: They're automated market makers. But instead of being a Dex that people trade against that pool, they are market making on top of the osmosis, contrary liquidity and order books. So that's another thing I didn't mention. We're also building order books as well. And the idea is the order books and cl pools are actually integrated as one system. But, yeah, you'll be able to do a curve V two strategy, but it's going to be on the same book as active limit orders and stuff, or elixir is building their own strategies as well. And so what I imagine happening is that new tokens at launch, they might go.
00:54:11.740 - 00:54:55.430, Speaker A: The nice thing about what amms did was it made the process to launch a token much easier. You don't have to go hire a market maker to do that for you. You just put assets into the pool or into these vaults, they'll do it. And then eventually what will happen is if an asset gets enough volume, enough traction, you'll naturally have active market makers come start to market make. And then at that point, maybe even a curve V two style strategy. Maybe it'll still be effective for your mid cap assets, but it's just fundamentally not going to be competitive in like a bitcoin USDC market. And so those are just going to start to go away, and those are going to be dominated by your active market makers.
00:54:55.430 - 00:55:37.062, Speaker A: So the nice thing of having, taking this vault on top of a single unified order book, we call these loot books. The combination of the order book and the contract liquidity book, we're calling the loot books. It stands for limit orders on ticks. Because basically what happens is in a CL system, you have these liquidity buckets. And what we let you do is we're going to let you place limit orders at the tick boundary. So if you're making a swap, it first goes through a specific bucket, then it goes Fifo through all the limit orders at the tick boundary, and then it goes into the next bucket, then to the limit order. So you kind of get a unified book.
00:55:37.062 - 00:55:43.210, Speaker A: And so, yeah, the goal here is build a single unified market and then let people build different strategies on top.
00:55:43.280 - 00:56:15.214, Speaker B: That's incredible. So we just spoke to Doug Colkett, the founder of Crocswap, formerly Crocswap, now ambient, and they're doing this similar thing with the limit orders, which is so cool. I love the use of this tick methodology to kind of create on chain limit orders. And then in that case, you're kind of like the LP, not the trader. Very interesting dynamic, but just for the listener, I feel like everyone's pretty comfortable with what the univ three amm style is. But when we talk about curve v two, this is an automated concentrated liquidity. That's why I'm calling it passive.
00:56:15.214 - 00:56:41.846, Speaker B: So there's basically like a trailing exponential moving average that the pool is aware of, of what trades get executed through the pool. And then the liquidity in that pool will continuously be rebalanced back to the central or the current point. So basically creating a univ three style, but without the lps actually having to move the liquidity. The pool does it instead. And so I love to hear that you guys are kind of innovating and shoving these two models together. It's funny. Effort capital.
00:56:41.846 - 00:57:23.594, Speaker B: And I were actually talking about that just a few days ago. So he probably was talking to somebody over there and brought that idea to me, trying to seem like the genius in the room. I love that we were talking about the trade offs between stakers and lps, but there's also the same trade off between lps and traders. And so the leading methodology to kind of bring some value back to lps has been, all right, well, let's institute instead of just a flat fee on trades, like a dynamic fee based on volatility or trade size or something of that nature, are you guys thinking about kind of introducing this dynamic fee model, like Trader Joe made this popular univ. Four is talking about it. Curve does it.
00:57:23.792 - 00:58:12.758, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is part of the job of a vault, basically. Like I said, I think the notion of the framing of LP trading fees is kind of off. What it really is is these are spreads, right? And what curve v two does by having a dynamic fee. But if you think about it, if it's a vault that's market making on top of an order book, all it's doing is based off of the volatility. It's replacing limit orders at changing the spread that it's charging on these limit orders. And so this is what astroport is building right now, is a vault that it places limit orders on the order book and just shifts the limit orders based instead of changing the fee.
00:58:12.758 - 00:58:16.166, Speaker A: It's not really a fee, it's just changing the spread that it's charging.
00:58:16.278 - 00:58:16.986, Speaker B: I got you.
00:58:17.088 - 00:58:57.080, Speaker A: Keep in mind, this is what market makers do in the real world. When volatility is high, they do two things, actually, right? They do one, which is they increase the spread. But the other thing they also do is they pull liquidity. And that's the other thing. I think we were working on a design for this. It ended up kind of being put on the hold because we decided to focus on building contrary liquidity and order books instead. But we were building a passive contrary liquidity system as well, that would not just increase the spread, but also pull liquidity at times of high volatility and then re add liquidity once the volatility goes down.
00:58:57.080 - 00:59:10.090, Speaker A: I think that by having a really good order book and a system for people to experiment with building vaults, we're going to start to see all sorts of interesting passive vault systems being built.
00:59:10.160 - 00:59:18.000, Speaker B: Okay, that's pretty interesting. And are these vaults, like permissionless, like, can anybody go create a vault and pair it with different assets? Or what's the idea there?
00:59:20.530 - 01:00:16.794, Speaker A: So deploying contracts on osmosis is permissioned. So it'll have to be whitelisted by governance. But you can also do it via interchain accounts, right? So you can have a contract on a different chain, like quasar, for example, and all the vault logic happens there. And it just, like using an interchange account, it just replaces the positions. The benefit to having a native whitelisted one on the osmosis chain is with the app chain functionality, we can give a little bit more benefits where, let's say something like astroport, if it's like something. This curve v two strategy is this special strategy that we want to encourage. We can actually give the astroport vaults the ability to replace their limit orders at the beginning of every block, because otherwise they are kind of playing this race game against other traders.
01:00:16.794 - 01:00:30.760, Speaker A: But instead, if we say, oh no, we're going to treat this curve v two strategy as something native, we can poke it at the beginning of every block and it will reposition its limit orders before anyone has a chance to trade against the stale data.
01:00:31.930 - 01:00:48.060, Speaker B: Okay, awesome. I love that as well. Now, this is super cool. And one of the other things that's kind of been a hot topic these days is if you know a user is bringing you toxic flow, should you discriminate against their order and maybe charge them a higher fee? What are your thoughts on that?
01:00:51.710 - 01:01:52.720, Speaker A: Who should discriminate? The job of a market maker is to do literally that. And the problem is, how do you know? You can't really know. The job of the exchange is to at least our job, how we see it is to build privacy. Right? And so right now, this is the whole idea behind Jit, like just in time liquidity, where the idea is, oh, you're only going to be market making against non toxic flow and pulling out when there's toxic flow. And some people actually, I think there's this harmful meme narrative that this is good because it gives better execution to traders. But I think that's actually not exactly correct where I think second order, it actually hurts the market because the job of an order book is to aggregate information in the market. And when people are keeping liquidity off of the order book, there's less information in the market.
01:01:52.720 - 01:02:37.200, Speaker A: People don't know how to set their slippage bounds correctly. And then because of that, because it looks like there's less liquidity on the book, and because people have set larger slippage bounds. Now you're actually going to have more front running and sandwiching happening. So I think, really, this jit liquidity is kind of harmful to the network. Like I said, it's fundamentally coming from a privacy breach right now, where the fact that you can see trades in the mem pool. So what we're moving towards is making private trading, and then if market makers have other ways of differentiating toxic flow or not, that's up to them to build strategies around.
01:02:38.850 - 01:02:39.406, Speaker C: Interesting.
01:02:39.508 - 01:03:02.920, Speaker E: So, switching gears a little bit, there is a ton of different Dex primitives launching in the cosmos. You got Astroport, which you've mentioned a few times. You've got duality, which is more atom economic zone centric. The list goes on. You got DyDx coming. So I guess just how are you thinking about this competition? Do you think it's, like, synergistic, or are you looking at it as like, man the time to ship and make changes to osmos now?
01:03:05.610 - 01:03:43.934, Speaker A: I guess both, obviously. I think competition is good. It puts a fire under our asses to ship faster. And I think more dexes, more activity in cosmos is always good. Just like we can't be everything for everyone but DyDX, right? We are not even going after the same market whatsoever. Right? DyDX is very much focused on only on perps and way more institutional trade. Know, our internal mission statement is we want to be our biggest competitor.
01:03:43.934 - 01:04:36.530, Speaker A: We see it as Coinbase, right? We're trying to be the best retail experience for trading crypto, but in a decentralized way. And so it's like we're not competing with DydX. And I think it's actually quite synergistic. We were just chatting with them about what are ways they're going to use us for onboarding flows of bringing users from Ethereum into their DYDX before chain, or even once they one day start to go towards multicolateral, like using osmosis for liquidations, for example. Right? So I think a lot of synergies there and then, yeah, astroport, right now, they're kind of acting like a Dex themselves. That's kind of the strategy that they're going on for how they are on terra and neutron, for example. But on osmosis, like I mentioned, their goal is less to be the Dex.
01:04:36.530 - 01:04:41.990, Speaker A: They know that long term you need order book style stuff, and that's not what they're building.
01:04:42.060 - 01:04:42.438, Speaker B: Right.
01:04:42.524 - 01:05:13.280, Speaker A: Their goal is to build amms, whether that means you have an amm that people can trade against directly, or whether it's an amm that a vault that market makes on top of order books. And that's what they're doing on top of osmosis and on top of injective as well. So with Astroport, I think we're collaborating on stuff. Duality. To be honest, I actually don't know too much about what exactly it is that they're building. I haven't really seen or played around with the product yet.
01:05:14.210 - 01:05:34.630, Speaker E: Yeah, I was curious specifically about duality. Just because they're probably not launching their own token, they're like, atom economic zone. I'm just curious if you think, I guess this atom economic zone is like the right path forward for the cosmos as a whole, or whether you think they need to be remaining more incredibly neutral, like was their kind of original mission statement.
01:05:35.930 - 01:06:02.974, Speaker A: No, I mean, I think the atom economic zone is a good strategy. I don't understand why duality doesn't have a token, though, or like, I don't know, the whole duality proposal was a little bit od to me. Well, keep in mind this is not the first time the cosmos hub has tried to build a fully atom owned Dex. Right. There was gravity Dex, but it kind of failed against osmosis because of a lack of incentives, of a lack of incentives for the dev team, really.
01:06:03.012 - 01:06:03.214, Speaker B: Right.
01:06:03.252 - 01:06:36.566, Speaker A: And so it kind of seems a little bit od to me that the duality system is like, oh, kind of just repeating the same thing. There's no token for incentives. Why is the dev team even incentivized to work on this two, three years down the road if they don't have any upside on it? Something feels a little bit too good to be true in the duality proposal to me, but I don't know if there might be other tricks up their sleeve on how they plan on doing it. The AEZ stuff is interesting. You see what stride did, getting Adam from the community pool. Put it on St. Atom, then LP on neutron.
01:06:36.566 - 01:06:55.234, Speaker A: Problem is, adam, St. Atom is not really a trading pair. Right? That's like a single asset. There's two versions of the same asset. I think how you build up liquidity is you need actual users who are willing to take risks and market make assets. Right? Adam, SD Adam is not really a Dex. Right.
01:06:55.234 - 01:07:09.910, Speaker A: You need ADam with USDC or you need Adam with Osmo. You need ball assets. You need multiple ball assets. So TBD, how the AEZ manages to build up liquidity for non atom assets.
01:07:11.290 - 01:07:27.082, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's a super fair take and a good point in terms. Know, you brought up interchange security with stride. I'm curious about mesh security. Can you kind of explain exactly how that's different just to clear it up for me, honestly? And then how osmosis is planning on implementing that, if at all?
01:07:27.136 - 01:08:18.074, Speaker A: Yeah. So mesh security kind of was what interchange security was supposed to be. Interchange security was this idea that the original idea was, this move is to build this restaking protocol where, oh, atom holders are going to be able to restake their atoms and be used to secure all the different cosmos chains. And then the atoms on the Cosmos hub will get slashed if there's anything malicious happening on any of these chains. And so that was this design that we came up with years ago. And then at some point along the way, the hub development team abandoned it and moved towards this very simplistic, basic version of ICs, which is all the hub validators run all these other chains, which is not really scalable at all.
01:08:18.112 - 01:08:18.458, Speaker B: Right.
01:08:18.544 - 01:08:51.954, Speaker A: You have to go through a governance proposal to add new chains. It's really a block size increase. It's not a scalability solution or anything. Right. And so the goal really was supposed to be this opt in thing where individual validators or stakers can choose which chains to give security to. And the whole point is that the belief in cosmos is not all chains need the same level of. Know, the example I always gave was, maker does not need, sorry, cryptokitties does not need the same security as the maker chain.
01:08:51.954 - 01:09:24.190, Speaker A: Right. It's fine for cryptokitties to have less security. And so that's what the opt in model does. And so because the ICS development team effectively abandoned it, we were like, okay, well, someone has to build this because this is like, how security needs to work in cosmos. So that's kind of why we ended up building mesh security. And along the way, while building it, we were like, hey, there's ways of using this protocol in ways we hadn't thought of before. Mesh security is really just this primitive of restaking.
01:09:24.190 - 01:11:09.520, Speaker A: But we realized, hey, why do we actually only have to get restaked from one chain? Why can't we get restaked from multiple chains? Let's say osmosis wants to get security from atom, but why can't we also get security from ETH via Eigen layer? Or why can't we also get security from, I don't know, bitcoin via Babylon, right? Why don't we get security from multiple places at the same time? The other thing, one is, why aren't we actually running these things? Like, why aren't I sorry. If the osmosis wants to provide security to the axlar chain, but Axelar wants to provide security to osmosis, that's actually win win for both of us, because now both of our chains are being secured by the sum of our market caps. And this kind of builds this level of resiliency where we don't want our entire ecosystem kind of the whole premise of cosmos has always been this very mesh, decentralized idea of no one central point of failure. IBC is point to point and something like Terra, right? It's always possible that the base asset of a system could go to zero in a day, right? And so it's like, let's not build all of our security assumptions around a single asset or system. Let's make it so security is this very polycentric thing of getting security from as many different places as possible. So, yeah, like I said, mesh security, it's a primitive, it's a set of things that you can use and then the economic constructions that people use this mesh security primitive in, there's going to be a bunch of different ones. So we'll see how those play out.
01:11:09.890 - 01:11:35.400, Speaker B: Yeah, that'll be interesting to watch the dynamics play between. And I'm just curious if I'm a hub validator and I'm just running my software and hardware to power the hub and now I'm powering multiple chains through ics, how does my, let's say just utility costs, like hardware costs, software costs, how does that change with the inclusion of ics? And is that any different for this mesh security model?
01:11:35.770 - 01:12:28.358, Speaker A: So the thing with the ICS model is that as a validator, you are forced to validate every chain that gets approved by ICS. And I think there's almost this weird mismatch between the validators who incur the cost, but are not the ones where these sole people of governance. And so governance keeps us approving every ics chain that comes along. But validators are bearing this cost of increasing fees. And so maybe what end up might happening is validators have to start charging more and more on commissions, for example, to cover these costs. But obviously it's possible as well that revenues from these chains could also offset the costs that they have to do. But the idea is that with mesh security is by making it opt in, validators choose which chains they want to run on.
01:12:28.358 - 01:13:22.962, Speaker A: Now it becomes instead of this very top down decision making that's going to be like, oh, governance selects that. This is what very command economy style the idea behind mesh is supposed to be way more hayekian. Right? Like, individual people will make decisions of validating which chains makes economic sense for them. And what you'll end up happening is having these power laws of security where some validators are going to be so efficient and they're just going to run on every chain possible, or maybe they'll run on the chains that they have incentive alignment with, while some chains are going to be so important and so lucrative that every validator is going to co validate that chain as well. So, yeah, it's just more like let the market figure out where security. The balance between security and economics.
01:13:23.106 - 01:13:49.966, Speaker B: Right on. Right on. And we just did a podcast with the Matterlabs team on the announcement of ZK Stack. And I'm curious to get your take on more broadly. The Ethereum vision has kind of shifted over the years, and it's kind of like culminating at this point that it looks quite similar to what the cosmos crowd has been banging a drum about for quite some time as well. So I'm curious to get your take. Like, we have app chains roll apps now they're calling them hyperchains.
01:13:49.966 - 01:14:11.998, Speaker B: That's basically just chains using the Cosmos SDK. The cosmos ecosystem has IBC for native out of the box communication, where the CK stack is using this. When you're using the same prover, you have the ability to what they're calling hyperbridges. So there's a lot of parallels that are getting drawn between the two. What do you think about that? And is this the right path forward for the Ethereum crowd?
01:14:12.194 - 01:14:42.818, Speaker A: I think it's definitely the right path forward for Ethereum. I think this architecture is the correct architecture and why we've been working towards it for years. I think, obviously, it does lead a question to, like, okay, in this world, where does Cosmos land, given all of this? Right? Like, if everyone in Ethereum is just building the same thing, what differentiates cosmos now? And I have my own answers to that, but I think we'll see how the market plays out.
01:14:42.904 - 01:14:56.950, Speaker E: I also wanted to get a more high level question from you. We were all speculating on what you meant by this in our analyst chat in slack, but you tweeted out proof of stake was a mistake. Can you please elaborate on what you meant by that?
01:14:57.100 - 01:16:16.906, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think what I've just been a little bit disappointed with how with staking derivatives in general or just the impact that they've had on. Honestly, I'll admit it was a little bit of a just like in the moment tweet. I didn't realize it would get this much attention. It might have been one of my most popular tweets in like a while because I think all the proof of work maxis founded and were like, oh, look, see? And that's not really what I meant, but what I really was trying was we spent so much time building these mechanisms into proof of stake. Make it so, oh, validators have something economic at stake, being this very open market where you say, oh, the holders of the tokens of the network will make decisions of choose who the validators are and using risk decisions that they make. But then the problem with stake narratives is they come along and basically hand select validators via sometimes a pretty opaque process. And then all the users choose to stake through these liquid staking providers in order to get the staking derivative because they want that liquidity.
01:16:16.906 - 01:17:30.722, Speaker A: And so it just feels to me that proof of stake is almost evolving somewhat into this proof of authority system instead, where it's like being selected by a hand selected people. And it's like, I guess my point was more like, well, if we're going to do that, why don't we just do a proof of authority system instead? Maybe let governance whitelist validators instead of having this whole proof of stake system. So it wasn't saying that proof of stake was like wrong. I think the mistake was that we spent a lot of the time in the design of proof of stake, not expecting staking derivatives to become as dominant as they are today. And so there's things I think we can solve in the short term. One of the things I've been pushing for heavily is this idea of copy staking, which is this idea that staking derivative providers should exactly copy the delegation distribution of non liquid staking derivatives users. So now, that way when you're staking, you have the choice of either you go through the derivative provider and you get this liquidity on your staked assets, or you stake directly.
01:17:30.722 - 01:18:14.198, Speaker A: You're foregoing that liquidity, but now you have the ability to choose the distribution of voting power. So you can imagine it basically ends up devolving down into like validators. Self bonds are the ones that are actually directly staked, while everything else is going through liquid staking, which seems like the end goal we're going towards. So might as well make it so the liquid staking providers aren't the ones selecting the validators. Rather it is still somewhat proof of stakeish in selecting the validators. So that's one thing, long term, I've always been a big fan of reputation based systems. I think proof of stake was better than proof of work in many ways and worse in some ways.
01:18:14.198 - 01:18:31.094, Speaker A: But I think the end goal here is like, okay, well, proof of stake is done, we've solved it. I wonder what are other mechanisms we can do to build decentralized consensus protocols. And I really think web of trust reputation systems are this interesting avenue worth exploring.
01:18:31.222 - 01:19:06.502, Speaker B: Yeah. Shout out to our good friend Ian for that tweet. He really got everyone thinking on that one. But I do agree, if you look at back at the Ethereum ecosystem, for example, Lido has such overwhelming dominance, and there's only 29 provider node providers that are operating the stake behind that ecosystem. And there are things like rocket pool that exist and that are kind of working to a much more decentralized model. But specifically in the cosmos, we really only see Stride, who is kind of building towards a more decentralized model that's similar to the one you just described. And they've mentioned the use of bonded delegations and things like that.
01:19:06.502 - 01:19:30.622, Speaker B: But it's just interesting to think through the dynamics of one protocol really being the deciding factor on stake, especially when there are pretty aggressive winner take all forces in the LST market. I think so do you think there's a possible solution? Would be other liquid staking providers kind of coming to market and having a great product and kind of helping balance that back?
01:19:30.756 - 01:20:27.558, Speaker A: Know, I think that's one thing that we're starting to see in Ethereum. I think rocket pool and CBE and stuff are starting to provide reasonable competition to Lido, but we'll see. I think the two things that I think would be the biggest threat to a dominant liquid staking providers like Astride or Lido would be one of two options. One is chains start building their own native liquid staking. So imagine someone builds like, here's this whole copy staking thing I mentioned, right? Someone could just go build a module that anyone can import into their cosmos SDK chain, and it just auto distributes in mints, liquid staking tokens, following this copy staking mechanism. And so it's like, why do you need a separate option when every chain can just issue its own LST? So that's one option. The other option is every DeFi protocol becomes its own liquid staking provider.
01:20:27.558 - 01:21:32.630, Speaker A: So this is something I've been, I don't know, I still think makes a lot of sense where, let's say something like Mars a lending protocol, instead of it accepting St atom and ST Osmo as collateral. What it could do instead is say, like, oh, it's only going to accept Atom and Osmo and then it's going to go use the non lent out Atom and Osmo and put it, stake it and earn the revenue from that. You can either treat it as protocol revenue or you could use it as incentives in your system. Or basically, why give up that revenue to a liquid staking provider when the DeFi protocols are really the ones who have the TVL at the end of the day and they could cut out a liquid staking provider as the middleman and just build that as a function of their DeFi protocol. This is kind of what anchor was trying to do in terra. So I think those are the two systems, you know, potentially disrupting the LST monopolies.
01:21:34.090 - 01:21:50.250, Speaker E: Interesting. All right, well, we're running up on an hour here. Actually, it's getting close to time, but I did have one more question I wanted to ask you before we let you go. ABCI Plus plus, what is that exactly? And how is it beneficial for osmosis?
01:21:51.230 - 01:22:39.814, Speaker A: Yeah, ABCI plus is a way of the way the Cosmos SDK stack was. Tenderman Stack was designed, was basically, you have a state machine that doesn't have to think about consensus. You can write a state machine, your business logic without even knowing it's running as a blockchain. And then you just run it on top of tendermint and now it's like, boom. Now you have a distributed state machine. Which was, sounded nice in theory, but in practice, what we realized over time was like, no, actually, when you're designing decentralized blockchain, like decentralized protocols, there's actually times when your state machine does want to be more opinionated about how consensus works. And so ABCI was the name of the original protocol.
01:22:39.814 - 01:23:10.978, Speaker A: It's sent for application blockchain interface that the cosmos SDK used to talk to tendermint. And what we did was ABCI Plus. Plus was basically something that our team invented over two years ago. Now, at this point where we're like, hey, okay, let's add more ways. This is like the extension of ABCI. We called it originally ABci 2.0, but it was a way of the state machine being more opinionated about the consensus protocol, and that gives you just the ability to do so much stuff.
01:23:10.978 - 01:23:37.660, Speaker A: Our original use case was we were trying to build the threshold decryption, which was like the private mempools, but you can also do things like validator provided price oracles you could do. Honestly, there's a presentation we gave like two years ago that kind of lists out all the different things you could do with. So it's really, that's AbCi Plus. Plus is what's going to give most unlock a lot of the app chain benefits.
01:23:38.190 - 01:23:38.650, Speaker B: Awesome.
01:23:38.720 - 01:23:48.302, Speaker E: Sonny, well, thank you so much for coming on. This has been a fantastic conversation. And again, thanks for being so generous with your time. Do you want to tell people where they can find you and learn more about osmosis?
01:23:48.366 - 01:24:05.278, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. You can find me on Twitter. I am Sonny a 97. And on Twitter, osmosis is at osmosis zone. And then the website is, you can try it out using osmosis zone.
01:24:05.374 - 01:24:05.826, Speaker B: Awesome.
01:24:05.928 - 01:24:11.700, Speaker E: Well, until next time. See you, Sonny. You.
