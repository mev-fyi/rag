00:00:00.170 - 00:00:34.200, Speaker A: And I think the thing that makes me excited about all these things is they sort of multiply each other. Like if you have prelaunch listings, like the ability to have oracles on thousands of markets, the ability to have permissionless market listings, all of those things work together and just create a much better product. And if you can imagine a world where anybody can list a perpetual future on any prelaunch, asset possibilities are endless. Like, this is why people are excited about decentralized perps for a long time now, and I think we're starting to see that finally come into fruition in 2024, and that's something to be excited about.
00:00:36.490 - 00:00:53.290, Speaker B: What's up everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research.

00:01:10.542 - 00:01:34.778, Speaker D: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We have an awesome episode lined up today with Antonio, the founder of DYDX, one of the most interesting and largest decentralized exchanges today. It is Wednesday, February 20 eigth as of recording. And as a reminder, be sure to use code Zero X research ten at app blockworksresearch.com for 10% off your annual subscription. Antonio, thank you so much for coming back on. It's great to have you here.
00:01:34.944 - 00:01:36.460, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, guys.
00:01:36.830 - 00:02:03.634, Speaker D: Yeah, so I guess just to get right into things, V four has been live for quite some time now. So maybe if you just give us a high level overview of how the migration from V three has gone. Like the ups, the downs as well as I'm curious, if you were making the same decision today to build a Cosmos SDK chain, would you do it with the current state of the infrastructure, in contrast to what the state of infrastructure was back when you made the choice to make the move?
00:02:03.832 - 00:02:47.460, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe I'll start with the second part first. I definitely would make the same decision. It has given us a platform that we're just excited about and we feel is going to be able to scale to the level that we need it to. I've talked about this for a while with the decision as to why we moved to Cosmos rather than building on an l two or another l one that we could have potentially launched on. So it certainly was the right decision and we're excited about it. I think that's really backed up by a lot of the volume that's happened on v four to this point. So there's been over a billion dollars a day of trading volume, still a little bit lower number of users on v four than v three.
00:02:47.460 - 00:03:11.014, Speaker A: That's something that I think will increase over time as people really understand the product, get acclimated to it. And one of the things we always try to do at DyDX is ship more of an MVP version to start. Still, we hold a really high quality bar here, but we have been putting a good amount of work into improving the software, improving the product. So that'll continue for a while as well.
00:03:11.212 - 00:03:30.014, Speaker E: Yeah. Following on that, obviously you guys are innovating on a lot of different funds, and one of those funds is the market listing module that you guys recently launched, making it super easy for anyone really to propose new markets. How is that going? And do you think the goal of 500 markets this year is achievable in 2024?
00:03:30.212 - 00:03:59.854, Speaker A: I do really feel like it is achievable. We try to set really high goals and that would be going from fewer than 50 markets to 500. So that's more than a ten x increase. You touched on the new markets modal that we launched recently. That's something that we are excited about and effectively just makes it a lot easier to use governance to add markets to the protocol. And that's a way markets can continue to be added indefinitely. We think that'll scale to some extent.
00:03:59.854 - 00:04:48.706, Speaker A: It's still a little complicated just because there has to be a governance vote around every one of these markets being listed and some other complications there. Just risk considerations because all of the markets are cross margined. The biggest things that we're working on developing right now are isolated margin into the protocol itself. So this is being able to isolate the risks of individual markets against the entire cross margin system. So this just lets the entire listing process be much more aggressive because now you can list things that don't have to necessarily affect the risk of the entire rest of the protocol. So like every new asset right now, since everything is being listed, cross affects the potential risk of the entire protocol. Whereas once we have isolated and there's the ability to list things there, it can be a lot safer.
00:04:48.706 - 00:05:39.030, Speaker A: So that just enables the number of things that could be potentially listed to increase ten, 100 fold. So that's a really important piece of what we're building and that should be ready in a few months. The next piece of what we're building, which I think is the critical thing to be able to get us to 500 markets this year and then more in the future, is the ability for anybody to list a market without a governance vote. So calling this permissionless market listings, it's one of the really big things that we're going to be working on developing in the next six months. But this, once it's combined with isolated, so once you can isolate the risk of one market, then you can be much more aggressive with the types of things that you list, but also how you list them. So you don't even necessarily need a governance vote to list a new market. You can just have anybody come put down a certain amount of stake on that market.
00:05:39.030 - 00:06:15.614, Speaker A: It's kind of similar to listing a market on uniswap, just like send a transaction. And the thing is live that has never really fundamentally existed in derivatives so far. And we're excited about that being the cornerstone of how new markets will be able to be listed going forward. So I think once we have those two things, then we'll see a huge increase in the velocity of listing new types of markets. So this will mean things get listed faster, more markets can be listed. And the thing I'm personally most excited about with this is experimentation. Like, it's not even up to us anymore, or it's not even up to governance anymore.
00:06:15.614 - 00:06:44.000, Speaker A: What things get listed on the product, it's just up to the users themselves. And as we've seen in crypto, I think this is a really core thing that people can be excited about. When there is the opportunity for experimentation with the types of things that can be traded. A lot of it won't work out, but some of it will, and it won't work out in the way you expect. But that's something I'm really excited about. So I think the combination of all of those gives me a lot of confidence that we will be able to hit this goal of 500 markets listed by the end of the year.
00:06:44.850 - 00:07:13.250, Speaker E: Following up on that, a few months ago, I think in October or maybe November, chaos Labs put out a governance post talking about two different listing approaches. One was a slightly more liquidity driven approach, and one was an oracle driven approach. Is there a certain approach that the protocol you think the Dow would sort of like lean towards. Or another way of phrasing this question is what type of approach is UIdX planning to take to ensure, for example, sufficient liquidity for these markets that they see enough volume over time, et cetera?
00:07:13.410 - 00:07:50.334, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. And this is really the last piece of listing new markets because markets can be live, but if they're not liquid, like, who cares? You can't trade them. So this is a big thing that we're thinking about. How do we solve for the 100, 200th, 500th market that's listed on the protocol? How can there exist liquidity on it? As I'm sure everybody knows right now, DYDX is an order book based exchange that gets basically all of its liquidity from more professional market makers. And this is great. This gives us the ability to have really great liquidity on the core markets that are being traded. But it's unclear whether this is going to work for the long tail of markets.
00:07:50.334 - 00:08:44.610, Speaker A: And I have my theories that it probably won't work out super well. So the next big thing that we are still thinking about right now, but are being pretty aggressive with the timeline and our thinking here is if we can create some form of vaults, amms on new markets, that is something we're really excited about too. And the way we're thinking about this right now is to basically at the protocol level, have a list of every market that could possibly be added. So there'll be an oracle provider that will just give oracles for anything you can possibly trade. So there could be thousands of those types of things. Then the next question is, how does something go from the state where there's oracles for a given market to it's actually tradable? And you need to have some process for that because there's limitations on the protocol for performance. And generally you need to have some baseline standard of liquidity before you start trading a perps market.
00:08:44.610 - 00:09:42.470, Speaker A: And the way we're doing this is by combining the market listings for permissionless markets with the vault amms. So effectively, once a new oracle exists for a new given market, there immediately will create a new vault amm that people can start depositing into for this market. And once that vault has enough deposited into it, and we think the amount can be pretty small, probably on the order of $1,000 or so, then that market becomes live for trading. And this actually solves both of the problems at the same time. Right. So it kind of solves this problem of how do you know which markets people actually want to trade? Well, they're putting money into these vaults. It's effectively similar to staking and solves, at least how do we get some small baseline level of liquidity on these markets? Because now there's an amm, which, yeah, it might not be able to provide as high quality liquidity as a professional market maker can, but that's probably not required for the early stages of an experimental market.
00:09:42.470 - 00:10:25.570, Speaker A: And we see these amms as being a way to bootstrap liquidity first and foremost, and to bootstrap liquidity, especially in these more fringe markets. And we see markets on DYDX likely eventually being kind of a progression from being amms at the start to eventually more professional market makers or whoever can start quoting on the order book and providing liquidity that way. And then as that happens, probably the amms will become relatively less profitable over time and people can withdraw. But that's okay. You've already solved the problem of how do you bootstrap liquidity on this market? So at a high level, that's what we're thinking about building. And again, we're being pretty aggressive with resourcing around this and trying to have this all live in the next six months, if not sooner.
00:10:26.790 - 00:10:41.980, Speaker E: Nice. That's super exciting to hear. On a similar note of shipping aggressively, I think in a blog post recently, it mentioned that you guys will be integrating social elements. And I think I personally am a big fan of the idea. Could you walk us through some of the ideas that you guys have in mind?
00:10:42.430 - 00:11:02.714, Speaker A: Yeah. So first of all, just to be clear, social is something I'm excited about, especially in regards to trading. I think it's just something that's really core to how traders think. A lot of traders, that is. And I think one of the cool things about DeFi is that it is super transparent. People have talked about this a lot. One of the concerns people have about Defi is that it's transparent.
00:11:02.714 - 00:11:45.358, Speaker A: It's like, how can I hide my trading strategy from everybody else? How can I have privacy with all my trades and this sort of stuff? And I've thought about this for a long time, and I don't think this is an objectively better approach. Like, there are some traders that want privacy, some traders that want transparency. But for the people that are using DeFi, we should really try to lead into our strengths of transparency and just make the whole thing transparent. Like, you'd be able to see how everybody is trading on the platform. It'd be really easy to follow traders to copy trade to do things like posting trades to social media, getting some virality around traders, that sort of thing. Potentially you could combine this with vaults in a similar way to how hyperliquid might. So these are all types of things we're excited about.
00:11:45.358 - 00:12:05.140, Speaker A: The thing I'll say here is we're not actively working on this right now, and I think that makes sense. We really try to ruthlessly prioritize what we are focused on and this trade anything thesis is the main thing we're working on right now. Social probably will be more of a six to twelve month plus type thing, but it is something I'm excited about.
00:12:05.990 - 00:12:16.146, Speaker D: Within the same blog post I saw that one of the goals for 2024 was to develop alternative clients written in other languages. What's the rationale behind that, and is that still a priority?
00:12:16.338 - 00:13:10.440, Speaker A: It still is a priority, and one of the big classes of users on DyDX is more professional traders, or just people using the API more generally. So this is where most of the volume comes from, and therefore it makes a lot of sense for us to consider that a really first class part of the product, and the product for that is the APIs that they use and especially the clients around it. So I believe a Python client was released recently. There's a c plus plus client that's under development, potentially a few other languages that are being considered as well. One of the cool things around this is that these clients have not been developed by the core DydX team, but rather people who are trading on the protocol and basically got a grant to do some of this development. I think that's something that's really exciting and is obviously enabled by the entire protocol being decentralized and open source now. So that's something we're trying to lean into more as well.
00:13:11.710 - 00:13:31.278, Speaker D: Yeah, I know how product focused of a founder you are as well. So I probably know the answer here, but I got to ask anyway. So there's just been a ton of innovation and increasing competition in the perps landscape. So how would you define the competitive landscape? How do you compete with the newest shiny token? Yeah, any clarity you could provide on.
00:13:31.284 - 00:13:52.306, Speaker A: That would be great. So this has been happening for a while. Honestly, there's been a million perps X's forever. However, I agree with what you're saying. It does feel different to me right now. I think that difference, the thing that's been going on for a long time is DyDX included. To be honest, there have been platforms that have gotten a lot of hype around token distributions.
00:13:52.306 - 00:14:25.710, Speaker A: Some of those have stuck like DydX, and some have not. And the thing you need to have to actually stick around, this is a great product, and I've said this a million times. So the reason I feel like the competitive landscape is different now is a little bit intuitive. But I do very much respect the products of some of the competitors that are being built now. Especially, I feel hyperliquid has a good product. Avo is pretty good. And I feel the biggest competitive advantage that DyDX has over those platforms is that, first of all, we've shown we can be extremely innovative in the space.
00:14:25.710 - 00:14:59.722, Speaker A: Like basically all of the big, or many of the big innovations in perpetux that have stuck have come from DyDX. There's a reason for that. So this kind of vision I was describing before on trade, anything, I think we have a lot of credibility that we can go out and execute on that. Right now. Some of those platforms are doing a faster job than DyDx of market listings. Like, for example, both of them, I think, had the starware token on day one. And on DyDX, it's like, yeah, the governance vote started on day one, but you need four days for that governance vote to finish.
00:14:59.722 - 00:15:30.854, Speaker A: So it was live to trade a couple of days later, which is a big step up. Like we hadn't been doing a great job on market listings for a while, but still not on par with some of the competition. But why are they able to do that? Just because they're handling market listings in a central way, which can work, and there's advantages to that. But there's a reason why we're building in Defi. We want to lean into the advantages of Defi. And I think the advantages of DeFi are transparency to some extent, but especially user ownership of the product. And that's something I'm really excited about now.
00:15:30.854 - 00:16:26.390, Speaker A: I think permissionless markets are a really good example of that. Just the entire thing being decentralized, controlled by the community, like the stakers on the platform, receiving the transaction fees, it all just kind of feeds back. It literally is this open source software that's controlled by its users in the community, and we have to find ways to use that in the product. It's not enough, and I'm not sort of going to engage with the thing that's like, oh, but they're not decentralized enough, so you shouldn't use them. I like say care, you just use the product that you want to use, and the product should speak for itself. I think we have to believe there are ways that being fully decentralized does give us an advantage on the product side. But the way I've started to think about it is what are the things that are uniquely enabled by decentralization that we can develop into the product, and how do we build those things? And people shouldn't have to care whether this is a Defi platform or C five platform.
00:16:26.390 - 00:16:49.582, Speaker A: They should just be like, oh, sweet. Like, I can list any market that I want to trade on DydX. I can't do that on binance, I can't do that anywhere else. I don't have to know why that's enabled. If I'm curious, I can realize that's because the system is decentralized. So yeah, that's kind of the tact I think we're taking here. We have built a product that is more distributed, more decentralized, whatever you want to call it.
00:16:49.582 - 00:16:54.480, Speaker A: But we do really need to develop things into the product that show the power of that.
00:16:55.590 - 00:17:14.598, Speaker E: Following up there on the competitive landscape a little, I think Freelaunch Futures is something that has found like relatively strong product market fit throughout 2023. Is that something that permissionless listings would eventually be able to support or is just not able to be supported given sort of the structure and the methodology of things?
00:17:14.764 - 00:17:53.714, Speaker A: Definitely. And I think these things all work together. So prelaunch listings are something that is on the roadmap for DyDX and we will develop at some point. And I think the thing that makes me excited about all these things is they sort of multiply each other. Like if you have pre launch listings, like the ability to have oracles on thousands of markets, the ability to have permissionless market listings, all of those things work together and just create a much better product. And if you can imagine a world where anybody can list a perpetual future on any pre launch asset, possibilities are endless. Like, this is why people are excited about decentralized perps for a long time now.
00:17:53.714 - 00:17:59.380, Speaker A: And I think we're starting to see that finally come into fruition in 2024. And that's something to be excited about.
00:18:00.230 - 00:18:32.606, Speaker E: Yeah, permissionless listing for prelaunch assets or even points sounds very cool, and I'm sure that will be such a big hit. Another wanted to ask sort of on the growth side of things. So obviously you guys use USDC issued from Noble. And as far as the latest numbers go, I think maybe 80 million USDC has been issued by Noble and 50 million of that has been sort of held within the DyDX chain. So how has the growth of Noble helped in sort of DyDX before's overall growth. And how do you see that partnership continuing to evolve in the future?
00:18:32.788 - 00:19:42.390, Speaker A: Yeah, that's been a close partnership for us for a while now. We're in pretty close contact with Noble even when they were getting started, and we were in pretty close contact with some other platforms, just to make sure that USDC within Cosmos, native USDC within Cosmos was a really big thing on that partnership side, I think something we're excited about that's happened recently is just CCTP within Noble. What CCTP stands for is the cross chain transfer protocol, which is effectively circle itself acting as a bridge. And there being no bridge risk when you transfer USDC between these different chains, no bridge risk and no slippage when you're doing those transfers. So that's something we're really excited about. I think noble and us, to some extent, are working with other platforms, like centralized exchanges, like could we get coinbase a binance to allow USDC to be withdrawn or deposited directly to DyDX? That'd be really cool. Then you could do these deposits from centralized exchanges in seconds with no gas fees, no bridge risk, and I think that's really exciting.
00:19:43.130 - 00:19:51.610, Speaker D: Have you checked in on the numbers by chance, like where most of the USDC is actually originating from, in terms of origination chain?
00:19:52.190 - 00:20:10.240, Speaker A: I don't have a perfect sense of this, actually. I would assume it's mostly from Ethereum, especially because that's where most people keep their money and where DyDxv three exists. But I think there's a sizable amount that's coming from other chains as well. And there's a lot of integrations with l two s. Got you.
00:20:11.010 - 00:20:27.560, Speaker D: I probably should ask this one too. When you were talking about isolated margin and making sure that risk is kind of contained to not encapsulate the entire protocol. So would you mind walking us through the whole Wifi incident, what exactly happened and how that really worked?
00:20:28.330 - 00:21:21.462, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So on the Wifi incident, which happened on DyDX v three, so the old version of DydX, and just as a precursor, there's a good bit of stuff that's been developed into DydX V four and V three. To some extent, that would have prevented or at least majorly mitigated a lot of this issue. So what basically happened is there was an attacker which took, I believe it was a long position in Wifi, and then really started on centralized exchanges in the spot market, pushing the price up quite a lot. They were long on DyDX, pushed up the price quite a lot, and then they pushed up it so much that they were able to tank the price really fast and effectively withdraw. Like, the protocol wasn't able to liquidate them fast enough, so it caused around $10 million to be lost from the insurance fund. So no customer fund losses or anything like that.
00:21:21.462 - 00:21:51.662, Speaker A: But it is a risk incident that we take really seriously. So that's effectively what happens on the investigation side. I won't go too much into this now, but one of the cool things that blockchain again is transparent. So we actually found the person who did this without too much hassle. And we're in contact with law enforcement around this, so we'll see how that plays out eventually. But I think that's a really big point of positivity. So, like, yes, these things can potentially be possible.
00:21:51.662 - 00:22:47.330, Speaker A: On the risk side, you can never have a totally risk free system when you're designing something like this, but just to have mitigations and to be able to figure out who did it from a transparent perspective I think is important. So on the risk side specifically, there's been a good bit in before that's different around deleveraging that is effectively more aggressive. That would have stopped an incident like this around things like variable margin fractions. One of the things we're implementing right now is basically difference in like the initial margin fraction will scale up as there's more open interest on a given market, especially for a given risk tier. So that would have not totally solved this, but really mitigated the attack because the attacker wouldn't have been able to take nearly as big of a position and it wouldn't have been as profitable. So this is something we pay a lot of attention to and we're developing a lot around before.
00:22:47.480 - 00:23:16.490, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely better that that happened now than in the peak of a bull market at a much larger size. But I think there's definitely valuable lessons learned in there. One of the cool features of DYDX is that you guys use ABCI plus plus for an invalidator Oracle network. So I guess the first question there is how has the Invalidator Oracle network been performing? Has it been accurate? Has it been performant? And the second question there is, are there any other plans on using ABCI Plus plus for any other features?
00:23:17.310 - 00:24:05.900, Speaker A: Yeah, so just a little bit on what ABCI Plus plus is. It's just a more efficient way, effectively to get information in the blocks. And one of the ways we use this on the DyDX chain is that the validators themselves, as you mentioned, are the Oracle price reporters. This is really cool because then the Oracle price reporters are as decentralized as the chain itself. Like every validator is also doing the service of providing oracles. So this has been working quite well, and it's something where there hasn't been any major losses on DyDXC four, even though we've seen a lot of price volatility, that's kind of the gold standard you should look at here. Is, is the liquidation system actually performing effectively? What's the health of the insurance fund? And the health of an insurance fund has been good on v four and has been only growing over time.
00:24:05.900 - 00:24:42.918, Speaker A: On the improvement side here, one of the things we're working on right now is a partnership with skip protocol to integrate Slinky, which is effectively going to make the oracles even more performant. So it'll allow us to have more updates more frequently, allow oracles for many more types of assets. This touches on what I was discussing before with the oracles for all the new markets that DyDx wants to enable. So yeah, this is something we're excited about, and I think it's just an iterative improvement that also uses ABCI Plus plus and also vote extensions to some extent on V four.
00:24:43.004 - 00:25:03.402, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? March is approaching fast, and I want to give you another reminder not to miss out on Das London. It is coming, it's right around the corner, and it's in March. From the 18th to the 20th, we have three full days of content. This is your chance to bump shoulders with some of the world's top executives and have open dialogue with both attendees and speakers. We're going to be focusing on a range of topics that I'll let Ren discuss for you.
00:25:03.456 - 00:25:40.230, Speaker C: First on the list we have bitcoin, catalyst, the halving and spot ETF. Next we have a view from the buy side from investors on things like strategy, portfolio allocation and more. We also have a topic on rwas, tokenization and stablecoins, which I think we can all agree are going to pay large role in crypto's future. We'll also talk about global regulatory frameworks like compliance, best practices, and the evolution of global standards that are shaping the global investment landscape. We'll also have someone from the institutional front to talk about infrastructure such as banking and payments, with financial giants like Visa and JPMorgan. And last on the list, the macro case for digital assets. So don't miss out on this monumental event.
00:25:40.230 - 00:25:49.478, Speaker C: Seats are limited, so be sure to register today by hitting the link in the description and using the promo code. Zero x ten to save 10% on tickets. See you in London.
00:25:49.574 - 00:26:00.480, Speaker D: One of the hottest topics going into the V four migration was MEV and the mitigation strategy around it. Can you kind of talk to that, how it's gone and whether there's further plans on improving that system?
00:26:00.850 - 00:26:48.318, Speaker A: Yeah, this is something that has pleasantly exceeded our expectations, to be honest, there hasn't been any major issues with MEV so far. So just to recap, the thing that we developed around V four is the ability to have a score for each validator, which is a numeric ranking of how much MEV they are extracting. And this is something you can see because the entire order book is transparent. And basically, on V four, it is possible to some extent, for validators to extract MEV as it is on basically every chain. But you can see it on v four, and we've made it really transparent. This is one of the other things skip is working on. On the DyDx chain, they have this dashboard which basically goes through each particular validator, what their score is.
00:26:48.318 - 00:27:37.166, Speaker A: I think there was one incidence where one validator had a slightly higher than the norm MEB score. They wrote a good blog post on this, and then it was remedied pretty quickly after that. So I think this is all pointing to signs that, at least for the time being, strategy on MeV has been the right one. I think longer term, there's still questions around whether just making whether MEV happens more transparent is the only solution that's needed, or whether there is some more in protocol mechanisms for how you could do matching, like how you could keep the order book, these sorts of things that could mitigate it much more at the protocol level. We have done a good bit of research on this, not in a totally final state yet, but have some good ideas here. Don't feel like it's necessary to implement right now, but we may do at.
00:27:37.188 - 00:28:05.080, Speaker E: Some point following up there. I think there's sort of two camps that one can approach, like long term MEV solutions. Right. The first is, I'm going to let MeV happen, but I'm going to find some way to internalize all of the MEV profits and distribute that to whoever maybe is lps, maybe it's traders, et cetera. And then the second one is, I want to just prevent MEV from happening at all. Is there a certain camp that you lean towards, and if so, why?
00:28:05.530 - 00:28:54.834, Speaker A: So I very much fall into the camp of trying as hard as we damn can to make sure MeV doesn't happen at all. I think this just makes the product much simpler and it's always going to be better for the traders themselves. There are some approaches where okay, could you let Meb be taken from the traders, but then distributed the profits back to them that are captured by the protocol in some way? It's possible, but that's pretty hard to do and is always going to make the product worse than just a product that doesn't have to deal with this issue in the first place. So that's really where we're coming from. Talked about the strategy we have so far just on the transparency side, but there are even some things that we are researching right now with ways you can do matching where MEV wouldn't really be possible. In the case where some minimum subset of validators are honest, which we're excited.
00:28:54.882 - 00:29:31.860, Speaker E: About, here's a follow up question to that, a slightly ridiculous example, but say one day, like 66% of the Dy DX distributes valid data set by sort of amount of tokens dedicated to them, decides to say hey, all right guys, we're all going to do Mev. It's this game theory scenario where all of us make a lot more money if we all sort of extract MeV from the system. And since all of us are doing it, you can't really kick all of us out because there's no, for example, any other info providers that are willing to run validators in that scenario. How do you think you, the foundation or like the protocol or the DAO would respond to an incident like that?
00:29:32.230 - 00:30:35.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, to be clear, we're pretty far off from that right now. I think everything's going quite well and we've been really impressed with the quality of validators in cosmos. That being said, I'll engage with the hypothetical, and I feel like in that case, it really comes back to what exactly the situation is. Are the quote like malicious or however you want to term the validators allowing governance votes to pass? Are they rejecting transactions for all those sort of governance votes? Are they allowing restaking of DyDX to other types of validators that maybe don't fall into that camp? There's a lot of different things that could happen here. So I think in that case we would advocate very strongly. And look, it's not up to us, it's up to the DyDX token holders, like where they actually want to stake to, but as much as they care about the health of the chain, the future potential of why they're staking and all this sort of stuff, I think they should care a lot about MeV. There should be penalties like slashing that should be considered, especially in these types of cases.
00:30:35.430 - 00:30:50.234, Speaker A: So I think those would be things we would advocate for the worst possible doomsday scenario. Again, this is not up to us, but it is a sovereign chain, so you can fork, you can do other stuff, and there are a lot of options available to you.
00:30:50.432 - 00:31:19.880, Speaker D: Yeah, that's like another prime example of the main benefits of the sovereignty and the design choices you made going over to the cosmos ecosystem. But one of the bigger news, I guess, things of the last week or two has been Uniswap foundation posting on the forum to turn on a fee switch. And then DydX, on the other hand, has been doing this since v four launch. So what are your thoughts on the Uniswap fee switch proposal, as well as just revenue share with token stakers in general?
00:31:20.330 - 00:31:58.154, Speaker A: Yeah. So for Uniswap in particular, I think it's something that makes sense. This is clearly something the community has wanted for a while. For Uniswap in particular, as you mentioned, this just in terms of the token holders themselves making the fees on the platform has existed on Dydxv four for a while. I would argue that makes a huge amount of sense on DyDxv four because the token holders are literally providing a service they're staking. It's the same as you would do on Ethereum or any other L1, and providing security to the network. So would have some questions around are the token holders in Uniswap providing as much value to the platform? Maybe.
00:31:58.154 - 00:32:36.602, Speaker A: I know they combined it with like, you have to stake to somebody who may vote on governance proposals and that sort of stuff, but it's a little bit less direct than on DyDX, but I think it makes a lot of sense. And honestly, I think it'll work out well for them. You can see the pop in their token price and all this kind of stuff. So clearly that was good. And then I think this is just something we've really been advocating for for a long time. Just generally, I define it as the users of the platform and the token holders are the ones that control it. And if there are any profits, if any, it should go to them and the people running the infrastructure, like the validators on DyDX.
00:32:36.602 - 00:32:49.634, Speaker A: So this is, I think, just a continuation of a trend that we've seen in crypto for a while. I think DyDX was earlier on this trend, but I think it feels good to see it continued in uniswap yeah.
00:32:49.672 - 00:33:20.620, Speaker D: I think that fundamental USDC revenue for the stakers is like foundational shift in terms of the utility it provides, the token. But I also think a big factor in, I guess, garnering a premium for certain tokens can often be, I guess it's utility. And with that is Stdydx. Obviously you guys have that integration with Stride. Have you thought at all about maybe incentivizing activity across different ecosystems to get people to use ST Dydx in DeFi or what's your strategy there?
00:33:21.810 - 00:33:58.178, Speaker A: I am not totally sold that using ST Dydx in DeFi is going to be the big thing that makes a difference for, call it the ecosystem of DyDx overall. That being said, it's something that I would be excited to see other people experiment with. I mean, I'm sure Stride themselves is really thinking about this, be the main beneficiaries of it, and other people are as well. So that's not something we're actively developing with the core team. But even this entire integration of the stake, Dydx, we didn't even do any of it. It was all just stride. And that's pretty cool just to see that happen from a third party perspective.
00:33:58.178 - 00:34:32.450, Speaker A: And again, that's really one of the big reasons why we've moved to this more decentralized model. Things can just happen and it doesn't even have to go through us or the core team. We're excited about the partnership, the integration with Stride. One of the things we're developing right now is an integration with Stdydx into the core product itself. There'll be like the staking tab and you can just one click stake your tokens directly in the product. Exactly the same thing you could do on Stride's website today. But just having that in one central place should be really helpful for more adoption and more staking, more security of the network.
00:34:32.790 - 00:34:53.530, Speaker E: I think one thing that I wanted to touch on was DyDX's validator set. I was curious that, I guess sort of a casual question, but are you happy with the existing level of distribution in DyDX's validator set? And are there any thoughts on incentives around distributing or decentralizing the validator set even further?
00:34:54.830 - 00:35:34.390, Speaker A: So this isn't something I personally focus on, as much so like somebody at the foundation would likely be focusing on this quite a lot more. But with my knowledge, such as it is, I would say that I feel it's in a pretty good spot right now. It's not perfect, and I think this is something we were pretty transparent about with the launch of the network in general was there's going to be more validators over time, probably at the beginning. The stake is going to be a little more concentrated. I don't think it's in a critical state like that or anything right now, but yeah, absolutely. We want to make it easier for more distribution to happen. I think stride and the liquid staking stuff is a good step in the right direction here.
00:35:34.390 - 00:35:57.200, Speaker A: Just because then are the staking pool operators can take more of an active role in who they're staking to. And probably there's going to be more decentralization in the validator set because of that. So that's, I think the biggest lever that we at DYDX trading the developers have over this is what are the integrations we can build into the product that make it as easy as possible to have a really distributed validator set.
00:35:58.850 - 00:36:20.774, Speaker D: We've seen some of the competitors go towards the modular stack. So Avo for example, on the op stack also using, I believe, Celestia for DA or at least plans to do that, or maybe that's lira. I can't really remember. It might be both. But what is your thoughts on that architecture? Do you think there's pros to going that approach? Or do you think just in general like owning the entire tech stack is.
00:36:20.812 - 00:36:51.070, Speaker A: 100% the way to go? I think there's trade offs, yeah, I don't think it's clear as clear as 100%. One is better than the other. Yes. Look, there's probably going to be a good bit more base level chain security if you use a roll up. And the big point of it, it's possible bridging might be easier though. I think honestly for DYDX, given that we're only using USDC as collateral right now, pretty much all of that is mitigated by having CCTP. So yeah, there's trade offs there.
00:36:51.070 - 00:37:39.690, Speaker A: I think the op stack is a good one to build on just because it gives you a good amount of customizability for what you're building into your chain itself. It's kind of similar to building your own l one. So I would almost argue that this architecture of having really custom control over the infrastructure that you're building on is the right way to go. That's proven in basically every product that exists right now. But I think that'll continue. And I think we try to be just moving like one step ahead of everybody else and having entire control, like literally the entire chain and everything is the software that we've developed so that just helps quite a lot. Just because you don't have to be beholden to whatever optimism does, whatever ethereum does, we can develop things as we want them to be, and that gives you a lot of flexibility going forwards.
00:37:39.690 - 00:37:58.520, Speaker A: And I think this is just a general trend that you see in technology where as the technology becomes more mature, usually it starts out on a platform that's more general and is easy and serves most of its needs, but then you want to build things that are more custom for your application and you try to be more vertically integrated, and that's exactly what's happened here.
00:38:00.250 - 00:38:22.300, Speaker E: Following up on something that you mentioned, sort of USDC as collateral, we've seen some diverters exchanges introduce sort of yield bearing versions of collateral. I think most notably Avo, they introduce a yield bearing version of USDC collateral. It's like 90% ten, it's got USDCAe or something like that. What are your general thoughts on just yield bearing collateral as a whole?
00:38:22.910 - 00:38:44.962, Speaker A: I think it is important. I don't think it's as important as things like how good is the core trading and what markets exist. So it's not a major focus for us right now, but we will get around to it at some point. Obviously, it varies a good bit based on what the interest rate environment is like. Nobody cared about this a few years ago, but right now it is an advantage. So it's something we're looking at. It's something.
00:38:44.962 - 00:39:11.600, Speaker A: Honestly, I feel circle and Coinbase could do a better job of with USDC itself, just finding a way to share some amount of that yield back with the projects themselves or developers or whatever. But I feel that's in a decent space right now. But this is all relatively new, just in terms of yield bearing stable coins in general. So it's something we're tracking but not actively developing right now.
00:39:13.490 - 00:39:32.062, Speaker D: I remember last time we spoke on the podcast, you mentioned the importance of mobile, I guess, tailoredness to the mobile user interface. How important would you say that still is today? And do you think a large percentage of volume on these perps exchanges comes from mobile, or do you think most of it is still done on desktop?
00:39:32.206 - 00:40:16.370, Speaker A: Most of it is still done on desktop, which is the case on DyDX as well. So I would classify mobile as a bet that we are making just in terms of can the market itself transition more from desktop trading to mobile trading as we've seen in traditional finance over time? I still think that's a good bet to make. And there was just the V Four iOS app that was released Android app is really close as well. So that's something that we're excited about, and I see it as lesser than web right now, but potentially a lot bigger. But our web product and web users, the professional traders, are still by far the most important users.
00:40:17.270 - 00:40:37.990, Speaker E: There's a follow up question to that. Are there any sort of user behavior insights that you think are really interesting that you could share? For example, I don't know, maybe 10% of users make up 90% of volume. Or surprisingly, most of the traders trade on sort of like New York stock exchange hours. I would love to hear any sort of interesting data points you have about user behavior.
00:40:39.050 - 00:41:10.690, Speaker A: I mean, this is something I feel you could probably find mostly on third party sites, actually. Just like there's a lot of data about what's going on on the chain, which I think is a really cool thing. So I don't have any huge ones off the top of my head. Yeah, the trading is pretty geographically distributed, as far as we can tell. I mean, I think you can see that in just where the IP addresses are located and also things like what time of day does the trading happen? And that's pretty distributed around the clock. So I don't have any amazing ones off the top of my head, but we'll track that going forwards.
00:41:11.910 - 00:41:30.600, Speaker D: This is more of a thematic question that I just don't have a good answer to, so I'm curious to get your opinion on it. But in traditional finance, we see options and futures contracts as the dominant instrument. Yet in crypto, obviously, perps are the dominant derivatives instrument. Why is this, do you expect this dichotomy to remain throughout maybe the next five years?
00:41:31.130 - 00:41:31.494, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:31.532 - 00:41:32.538, Speaker D: Any info you could share on that?
00:41:32.544 - 00:42:04.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I do expect it to remain, and this wasn't something I always believed, but I very much do now. And I think it's because the market structure in crypto is just fundamentally different, where individual professional. But retail traders make up the bulk of the volume that happens in crypto, or at least the bulk of the organic volume that happens in crypto. And that's really fundamentally different than traditional finance. And those types of users want a simpler type of product that has more liquidity around it. And I think that is perps. It was really interesting.
00:42:04.994 - 00:43:08.934, Speaker A: One of the things that crystallized this for me is we had Arthur Hayes himself in for a fireside chat at DYDX, and I asked him this question, why did you guys do perps? Like, how did you come up with this thing? And it was interesting. I didn't actually know this at the time, but BitMex started with options, and they were very early with options in crypto. And Arthur himself was doing customer service for Bitmex at the time. And everybody kept writing into him and being like, what the heck is, like, what is the strike price? Like, I don't understand these things. And Arthur would explain these things to people in a really good way. But ultimately he had the insight that, why are we doing this? Could we create a product here that solves all these products for problems for users and doesn't have an expiry and doesn't have strike prices? It's just like you buy bitcoin and it just feels the same as if you're buying spot bitcoin, but sweet. You can do it with ten x leverage, and there's some complexities around that, like the funding rate, but those are a lot easier to understand than I have to buy this bespoke product every month.
00:43:08.934 - 00:43:14.538, Speaker A: So I think it really fits with the type of traders that are in crypto right now, and I think that'll continue.
00:43:14.704 - 00:43:33.380, Speaker E: From what you've said over the past an hour or so. The one to two year roadmap for DyDX is pretty curious. A strong focus on permission assistings, figuring out sort of like a vault framework for these permission assistings. What does a ten year roadmap look like for DyDX ten years down the road? What do you want DyDX to be?
00:43:34.550 - 00:44:07.866, Speaker A: I mean, I've honestly started to think about roadmaps on a shorter term intentionally, which is part of where unknown comes from. And I used to have for DyDX this like two or three year roadmap for the company. Here's what we're going to build, then this, then this. And I stopped doing that. And I think that was actually one of the best things that I did at DyDX, is really only think about things on a six to twelve month time horizon. We can think about the long term, but we're going to have a lot more information to think about the long term when we're in the long term. So we just do it then, rather than having a lot of plans around it.
00:44:07.866 - 00:44:47.474, Speaker A: That being said, it is very important to crystallize the vision for what are we doing here? Why should people care about this for the long term? On that, I would say that clearly crypto trading is a thing now. It's not going away. Clearly it's going to grow over time. And clearly derivatives are the biggest way that crypto is being traded. And I think that trend will only continue into the future. And being able to trade those things on a product that is fully decentralized, that is controlled by its users, that does have fundamentally new types of features that you could not have on centralized exchanges. That's what we're building here, and that's why we're excited long term.
00:44:47.474 - 00:45:29.038, Speaker A: So I don't know exactly where that's going to take us. I think the vision is that combined with really growing decentralized trading in DFI overall into centralized exchanges, right now, DFI herps exchanges are about 2% of all herps volume in crypto, which is the bulk of all crypto volume, period. And that is going to grow a lot over the next few years. And I think that's why you see pretty heavy competition in the space now, and a lot of people are excited about it. So we're excited to really be pushing what is possible with that. Talked about permissionless listings. We've talked about the ability to trade anything on a derivatives exchange.
00:45:29.038 - 00:45:37.880, Speaker A: Potentially it's things like social in the future, but we'll see where it goes and I think we'll get a lot of evidence as we go along. And it's still pretty early days in this market.
00:45:39.050 - 00:45:46.410, Speaker D: Awesome. I got one more closing question for you. I know you're at eat Denver. How is it? Is Denver as bad as everyone says it is? How are the vibes?
00:45:46.830 - 00:46:18.558, Speaker A: I like Denver, and I think the vibes are pretty good. Obviously, everybody is excited about the price. There seems to be good amounts of renewed enthusiasm. I mean, I've been in crypto for like nine years at this point, so not to say I'm totally over it, but I'm a little over the whole in bear market cycle, and we really just try to build through everything. That doesn't mean I ignore it. I think it is really important to understand what's going on, to feel the highs, not to get too hyped, really, to stay on track for the long term, not to get too low during the lows. But I think it's good.
00:46:18.558 - 00:46:25.320, Speaker A: It's great to see a lot of people out building a lot of exciting things within crypto, defi and elsewhere. So it's good energy.
00:46:26.010 - 00:46:34.166, Speaker D: Awesome. Love to hear it. All right, Antonia, thanks so much for coming on. Is there any last words you want to share with the listeners, like where to find you or learn more about DyDx?
00:46:34.358 - 00:46:44.000, Speaker A: Yeah, so we are at DyDx exchange online. I'm at Antonio Mgiliano on Twitter, and then we're at dydx on Twitter. As well.
00:46:44.450 - 00:46:46.750, Speaker D: Awesome. Take it easy and enjoy Denver.
00:46:47.170 - 00:46:48.366, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you, guys.
