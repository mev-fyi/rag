00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.960, Speaker A: Is this a consumer facing phone? Is this an NFT? Is this like a scarce value thing? Like there's no clear product strategy for what the saga phone is at this point. And I feel like it's just been like really forced. Like, in reality, I do not want to use an Android phone right now. I like the blue text. That's all I have to say about this.
00:00:25.370 - 00:00:44.214, Speaker B: It what's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. March is just around the corner and I wanted to make sure to give you a quick reminder to not top tick your prices of your Das London tickets. If you use code zero x ten at checkout, you can lock in a 10% discount on your ticket. Don't miss out on your chance to get ahead of the curve. I'll see you in London.
00:00:44.262 - 00:01:18.410, Speaker C: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. The Blockworks research team is back to give you another episode of an analyst Roundtable. Today is Tuesday, January 16, and today I am without my co host Dan. He is getting so much need of vacation. But we do have westy effort Capital and Zero X pibbles joining us this week. So I was thinking we could start this off by, I guess, going through some news and governance updates and I can kick this one off for us. So over the weekend we saw a rabbi wallet teasing a snapshot on Twitter for what people are speculating will be an airdrop.
00:01:18.410 - 00:01:43.680, Speaker C: I actually saw a pretty good take on this one on Twitter from cryptocondom, saying that a lot of the swaps are mev protected and used aggregators by default. So the cow protocol could potentially benefit from some increased rabbi wallet adoption. Thought that was kind of a cool little takeaway from that. I don't know. I think some of you guys on the team use Rabi. I admittedly have not. So curious if you guys have any insights there.
00:01:44.850 - 00:02:14.120, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm a big user of Rabi for my Ethereum transactions and I love the user experience. I do a good job in showing you exactly what you're actually interacting with, how much is being withdrawn or deposited. It's really straightforward and good for sort of the crypto degen who wants to know exactly what they're doing with their wallet. So obviously I'm super happy that there's a potential airdrop coming my way.
00:02:15.130 - 00:02:22.534, Speaker C: Is it pronounced rabbi? Did I just butcher it? Calling it Rabbi for the first three minutes of the episode, the first kosher.
00:02:22.582 - 00:02:24.060, Speaker E: Wallet in web3.
00:02:25.390 - 00:02:46.114, Speaker C: That's actually pretty good. I love that. Okay, on to the next one, though. Yeah, I think that a lot of people for Rabbi have been. I don't think people actually thought there was going to be an airdrop, so people have just been shilling that product because it's genuinely a good product, which is obviously a pretty good sign. So maybe check that one out. That's on my to do list as well.
00:02:46.114 - 00:03:15.020, Speaker C: Tangentially to cow protocol, they're also renewing their grants program with 700,000 XDi and 1 million cow tokens, with an additional 3 million cow tokens for a volume incentives program. So that's worth about roughly $1 million with $0.33 cow token price. So kind of substantial. Hopefully that can drive some more volume there. I feel like there's, like, renewed interest in cow swap, so that's pretty cool to see. I know everyone here on the team is pretty big fans of what they're doing.
00:03:15.020 - 00:03:19.020, Speaker C: Anything else you guys got to add there, or should I move on to the next one?
00:03:19.470 - 00:03:29.710, Speaker A: I just like to point out that Calswap is a great protocol and was one of my best airdrops in crypto, so. Always here for more Cal airdrops.
00:03:30.610 - 00:04:11.982, Speaker C: You love to hear it. Plus, the moo sound everyone gets all hyped up about is always a nice bonus. Kind of reminds me of pseudoswap days when we're all having fun over there. But onto Eigen layer, they're adding some new lsts January 29, and they're also reopening the restaking window for assets between January 29 and February 2. Kind of self explanatory if you want in on that airdrop, I guess. Presumably to deposit some lsts into Eigen layer and. Yeah, I mean, I'm seeing some huge expectations for the airdrop value on my timeline, given the Eigen Da and wider Da narrative, the restaking narrative, all the protocols popping up there.
00:04:11.982 - 00:04:15.470, Speaker C: Does anyone have anything they want to say on that narrative?
00:04:16.050 - 00:04:22.160, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to 1 quadrillion fully diluted valuation day one.
00:04:23.010 - 00:04:42.920, Speaker C: I mean, based on my timeline, I would take it as fact, to be completely honest, everyone's doing the moon math already. But, hey, it worked out for Dan when he was doing the jeto calculations with the flashbots premium, so maybe it'll actually launch at quadrillion. Another one here. We've talked about this a couple of times. Sorry. Effort. Did you have something there?
00:04:43.530 - 00:04:52.620, Speaker E: I was just going to say, I'm convinced nobody still understands what Eigen layer does or what an ABS actually is. But, yeah, it's absolutely going to a quadrillion dollars, because nobody understands what it is.
00:04:54.670 - 00:05:48.220, Speaker C: Yeah, I had to. Embarrassingly, someone dropped avs like that acronym in the chat and I had to look up what it was because I swear there's like a new acronym every other day in this space. It's really annoying actually. But onto Avo we've mentioned this a couple different times. Probably got some salty team members here who fumbled some bags there because everyone knew this was going to happen, but again, we were probably too early. The TGE for AVO, which is again the ribbon token migration over to a new token on the op stack derivatives chain slated to occur before February 1. And it's my understanding that the tokens, when you enter the migration, will be locked for three months as Savo and Savo holders get numerous perks such as boosted rewards, two times voting power, the ability to submit proposals, as well as discounted fees on the product or products I should say that they offer.
00:05:48.220 - 00:06:30.474, Speaker C: And on top of that, it looks like they're planning to do a pretty generous incentive program once that token migration occurs. So I assume the rewards for the people who do migrate the token will be pretty fat. They did a ton of volume last week. They brought in like half a million fees, which was pretty cool to see. And just for extra context, DyDXv four did about $750,000 of fees over the same time frame. Pretty bullish on Avo. It's hard for me to distinguish if this is organic volume or people trying to game an incentive program with the rules not clearly defined yet, or if people are genuinely using these products because it's pretty good because admittedly I have not used it.
00:06:30.474 - 00:06:33.514, Speaker C: So I don't know if anyone can add some extra color on this one.
00:06:33.712 - 00:07:16.840, Speaker A: The secret to the high fees is creating the worst spreads in crypto. You're raking the most fees, but the actual platform itself is awesome. It's crazy to see ribbon pump like this, or to expand in value like this, because the liquidity to fully diluted market cap was insane for a long time. Like they dipped sub seven figure liquidity on the token and then something happened there. Someone added a bunch of liquidity, which is great. I think it's a great product, but they really need to ramp up the market making on there to make it an actual enjoyable experience.
00:07:18.410 - 00:07:51.090, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I'm coping right now. You can actually see my capitulation wick on the Coinbase ribbon USD chart. I held that thing, bought it at a good price, sold for a decent profit, held it for probably like three to four weeks while Tia and everything else in the market was ripping while this thing was completely staying flat in low liquid chop. And then one or two influencers tweeted about ribbon, like, last week or a week and a half ago, and it proceeded to pump, like 30% to 40% since. So overall, good product. I'm just a little butthurt.
00:07:51.510 - 00:08:23.440, Speaker A: I think that the ribbon team has really just demonstrated how Lindy they are, because I remember ribbon earn was a product, and I thought that was super cool in the beginning, but then I think something terrible happened with cridera lending platform because it was like, under collateralized lending, and then someone blew up somewhere and the ability to recover from that and then pivot to like, oh, we're going to make a roll up. Just hats off to the team for staying alive, not blowing up.
00:08:24.610 - 00:08:50.440, Speaker D: Yeah. One cool feature they have that I'm hoping they improve upon is, like, the pre token trading, where you can trade tokens before they're live. So I know when I'm trying to look at what the price of jupe or dimension is going to be, it's the first place I go and first place a lot of other people are going. I wish there was maybe more liquidity and trading volume, but obviously it's a new product and people are testing it out, but I think that's obviously, like a really cool innovation that they're working on.
00:08:54.330 - 00:09:20.314, Speaker C: All right, on to the next one, then. Instagram intern on Twitter to jail is what I have written here on my note sheet. They basically tweeted out a low cap coin and it went six x immediately. So I don't know if the Twitter was hacked like the secs or if that's, like, a legitimate thing. Does anyone have actual information on what happened there, or is this just typical shenanigans? In another day in crypto, the ticker.
00:09:20.362 - 00:09:58.810, Speaker A: Is swag and it fully retraced already. But yeah, they did tweet out about these nfts for some metaverse monster thing. But I think they're like miniature collectibles too, which I can actually understand consumer appeal for miniature collectibles, because my girlfriend is going insane over these things called, like, calico critters. They're like these little tiny fuzzy things that girls will just carry like five or six of them in their purse and whip them out at a bar or something, and they just take pictures of them. So I'm here for the minima narrative.
00:10:01.470 - 00:10:19.650, Speaker C: That's hilarious. I'll have to. Have to get myself a furry little creature to carry in my wallet or something. I don't carry a purse, so I don't know where else I'd put it. But anyways, exploit on Bungie? I'm probably butchering that just as bad as I did. Rabbi. But Bungie exchange as well as socket, it's like some bridges.
00:10:19.650 - 00:11:00.842, Speaker C: Not really completely sure on exactly what happened here, but it sounded like it was people who had infinite approvals on a certain contract basically were able to get their funds drained, unfortunately. So socket already came out publicly today on Tuesday. This episode will probably air on Thursday and said that they paused the effective contracts. Sounds like great decentralization. But side note, be careful with bridges is the main takeaway there, and we've kind of beaten that one to a dead horse, so I'll just leave that one at that. Westy, I was actually curious to get your thoughts on this next one. Vitalik posted, I believe it was on Reddit that he would be for increasing the gas limit on mainnet today, which was kind of a bit surprising.
00:11:00.842 - 00:11:09.890, Speaker C: Obviously this isn't like a serious proposal or anything. He was just kind of making a point. Know we can. Do you have any opinions on that, or are you not too familiar with the scenario?
00:11:10.390 - 00:12:16.322, Speaker D: Yeah, I actually talked a bit about it on Bell curve last week. But yeah, it's super interesting to come from him because it seems like there's this whole narrative push for all of the users on Ethereum to jump to l two s, that the l one is just basically hosting roll up data and settlement, and this is sort of antithetical to that, where it's trying to create better performance on the l one. So it seems kind of weird, but at the same time you can understand where people are coming from. Obviously see Salana and high throughput chains do really well recently, and obviously you want to attach yourself to some of that and gain liquidity mind share activity back. And this is one way to do it. And there's also questions around client diversity here as well, where if you increase the gas limit, then all of a sudden people are going to jump to the majority execution client because Beisu, which is like the second biggest execution client, is way less performant than geth. And so it just gives more of a reason for people to just center around one client.
00:12:16.322 - 00:12:26.620, Speaker D: So those are like the two biggest issues. But yeah, to me it seems weird and I'd probably be slightly against it, but like you said, it's not anything super serious at the moment.
00:12:28.350 - 00:12:56.286, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, I actually do remember someone prominent in the Ethereum community coming out and basically saying, yeah, let's not hold back Ethereum performance for one really. Minority client execution client Besu, I believe is what it's called. Just trying to maintain that in the client diversity because only like less than 1% of validators run it anyway. So very helpful context. Thank you, Westy. And then I've got one more for you guys and then I promise I'll stop rambling.
00:12:56.286 - 00:13:33.054, Speaker C: DyDx V three incentives are officially over with the conclusion of epoch 31. So now 90% of trading fees can be rebated on V four for users on top of the six month incentive program that's active and was introduced by Chaos Lab. So on top of that, I saw Antonio tweet over the weekend that his goal for 2024 is to get 500 markets on DyDX V four, which is super cool. They just registered an all time high in daily volume on V four, which was like 1.2 or 3 billion, something like that, if I'm recalling correctly. So things are humming along over at Dydx. So that's pretty cool to see.
00:13:33.054 - 00:13:44.722, Speaker C: Honestly, it's nice to see the app chain thesis actually proliferate and a lot of that volume starting to migrate over to the cosmos ecosystem effort. I don't know if you have anything you want to share on DyDX. I know you're the Cosmos bull out of us.
00:13:44.856 - 00:14:25.454, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, it's just good. Thank God that the transition actually was smooth because if it wasn't, the cosmos ecosystem is starting to see some increased mind share again and increased liquidity, like Noble USDC. I think native USDC issued on Noble. The canonical USDC of the cosmos ecosystem is actually surpassed like optimism native USDC and a couple of other major l ones in the crypto space. So it's almost at 100 million dollar market cap today. So increased liquidity in the cosmos is good for ecosystems. That was always like good tech, but just poor liquidity since the post USD collapse.
00:14:25.454 - 00:14:35.730, Speaker E: But a Cosmos app chain is currently the largest Dex in crypto by market volume. So that's pretty huge, I think. And really a testament to the appchain thesis.
00:14:38.390 - 00:15:11.246, Speaker C: Yeah. Cheers to the DyDx believers. That's pretty awesome to see in live production, but yeah. Okay, so we'll head over to the hot seat cool Thrones section. But before we do that, we got a quick word from chorus one. Thanks to our fantastic sponsor DyDX, we're going to be doing five minute short clips with, I guess, founders and relevant parties within, I guess, the ecosystem of DyDX and parties that are relevant to what they're trying to accomplish over there. So definitely let us know in the comments if you like this format and if you find the content valuable, because that's ultimately the goal here.
00:15:11.246 - 00:15:25.330, Speaker C: We're not trying to be Shilly, we're just trying to have more of a fun take on advertisements. So it's not as boring as listening to Dan or I or Ren or someone else on the team, basically just reading off a boring ad read. So definitely let us know what you think. We'll see you guys in a sec.
00:15:25.400 - 00:15:42.774, Speaker F: Thank you. This week we're starting a new segment, which is the DyDX segment. In this segment, we'll be inviting participants throughout the Dy DX ecosystem to talk about everything and anything happening in there. For the first week, we have Brian Crane, co founder and CEO of Chorus one, joining us. Thank you so much for coming on, Brian.
00:15:42.902 - 00:15:44.780, Speaker G: Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:15:45.310 - 00:16:01.610, Speaker F: Yeah. To start us off, Chorus one has 50 plus supported protocols and nearly $3 billion in staked assets. You're one of the largest players in the validator space. So throughout all of that, what have you learned about the complexities and challenges that come with staking?
00:16:01.770 - 00:16:07.386, Speaker G: Yeah, I think staking is really sort of at the core of running all of these crypto networks.
00:16:07.418 - 00:16:07.614, Speaker E: Right.
00:16:07.652 - 00:16:53.970, Speaker G: Like today, most networks are proof of stake networks. And so doing what we're doing, it really means running a big variety of different crypto networks with different consensus mechanisms, all kinds of different stuff. So I think definitely one of the important things and things that we really care about is to understand the technology deeply, have really amazing engineers. We run our infrastructure on bare metal, so really kind of control it fully, care a lot about security. Of course, another thing that's really crucial about running validates, I think, is contributing to the networks we support. And that can have many different forms. Of course, running the nodes is one thing.
00:16:53.970 - 00:17:23.690, Speaker G: It can include contributing to governance, decision making, giving feedback. We invest in protocols. There's like many different ways we try to kind of help the network, contribute to the networks. And then maybe the third thing I'd mention here is, of course, the sort of relationship with the token holders, because in the end, the customer is. And who helps us generate our revenues are the people holding tokens. But it's not just people. It's people.
00:17:23.690 - 00:17:52.306, Speaker G: It's BC fonts, it's wallets, it's etfs, it's exchanges, it's custodians with lots of different parties. And they have different requirements, they need different products, they need data in different ways. Some need APIs, some need user interface. So yeah, I think dealing with all that, figuring what you can do in the best way, supporting all these protocols, I think those are kind of the key things, I think, for doing this well.
00:17:52.408 - 00:18:15.290, Speaker C: So you mentioned how you support a lot of different chains and validate a lot of different chains. What is the main differentiating factor for DyDX? One that comes to mind specifically for me is the USDC revenue component as opposed to the native token issuance potentially. But I know there's also fragmented order books amongst the validator set, so maybe if you could just speak a little bit to that.
00:18:15.440 - 00:19:01.966, Speaker G: Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think of the proof of stake protocols, I think DyDX is probably the only one that I'm aware of that does not have any token issuance. So all of the revenues on DyDX for the stakers and for us as validators come from the trading fees that people are paying when trading on DyDX and are paid in USDC. So that is super cool. Actually, the staking returns aprs are pretty substantial at the moment on DyDX, purely coming from trading fees. Of course, there are a lot of other things. Just as a product, DYDX is very unique because you have this incredible user experience for a decentralized order book based decks.
00:19:01.966 - 00:19:32.610, Speaker G: So I think it's just a super crucial product. And I think it's really one of those projects where in the future you could imagine thousands, tens of thousands of assets all over the world all being traded in this one exchange in a decentralized way. So I think in terms of the ambition and the scope of what Duidx is doing, it's very unique and it's just very exciting. And I find the user experience of DyDx chain is just fantastic.
00:19:33.590 - 00:20:04.314, Speaker F: Yeah. With those unique features that a validator has to be in charge of also comes unique complexities, right? One of which is how MEV is managed on DyDX. I've read the papers that chorus one has produced surrounding MeV on DyDX, and to be honest, they seem like completely different games than the sort of MeV that one would think of on say, solana or Ethereum. So what are your thoughts on MeV in general, and how do you kind of see that play out in the future, especially pertaining to DydX?
00:20:04.442 - 00:21:04.578, Speaker G: So in general, MeV basically revolves around taking the transactions or the blocks and kind of using those in an optimal way to produce the most value when those blocks are created. And of course, let's say if you look at Ethereum there's a whole bunch of different parties that are in that. There's these block builders, then there's relayers, there's validators. Where this all is going is that each party sort of tries to do the thing that's profit maximizing, and that's where the equilibrium is, right? So in Ethereum, when Mev kind of came up, there was people who are like, oh, this is a bad thing, it's a bad thing. And of course, not long later, everyone was running flashbots, right? And everyone is doing it in the DyDX case, right. DyDX case basically came to us, and they wanted to work with us on figuring out how to do MeV optimally for DyDx chain. And the thing that's very different about DyDX is they control the application as well as the chain, right.
00:21:04.578 - 00:22:02.786, Speaker G: They basically felt that we concluded, right, that if you're going to have MeV and people, for example, sandwiching users, then it's not a great thing for the user experience. And what we came up with as a solution here was basically looking at what the validators basically using statistical measures to detect when a validator is doing something other than just taking the transactions in the order received and proposing the blocks like that. And if that happens, they basically get penalized. So the idea here is that some kind of monitoring of what are the validators are doing, and a potential slashing of validators who engage in some MeV, that kind of creates the incentives for a validator not to do that. And that's kind of the equilibrium we have on DyDX at the moment.
00:22:02.888 - 00:22:23.962, Speaker C: Yeah, that was super interesting, Brian. Thanks for explaining how Mev kind of differs on DyDX chain versus others. And it's really cool, and I'm interested to see it progress over the coming years as to how that system to mitigate Mev works. But thanks so much for coming on, Brian. We'll be sure to drop a link in the show notes to your twitter. Do you mind sharing with people where they can learn more about chorus one?
00:22:24.096 - 00:22:46.398, Speaker G: Yeah, sure. Yeah, just go to chorus one. So chorus one, you can learn everything about the networks we support. We produce a lot of research as well, including on topics like MEb, Duidx. And so you can also find all of that there, or you can get in touch if you want to stake or have any other questions you want.
00:22:46.404 - 00:22:47.438, Speaker D: To discuss with us.
00:22:47.524 - 00:22:57.894, Speaker C: Awesome. And next week we will be talking with Kepler. So, listeners, be sure to put in the comments if you have any questions for them. And we will be sure to ask. Thanks again, Brian. We'll talk to you later.
00:22:58.012 - 00:23:22.218, Speaker A: Let's get started with some hot seat. Coolthrone. I'm going to start my hot seat off with a disclaimer. I respect the Solana foundation. I respect Solana mobile. I respect the ambition it takes to launch a crypto phone. But I'm going to get into the second drop of saga phones.
00:23:22.218 - 00:24:18.526, Speaker A: So I think the original price for sagas about a year ago was like 1000 or $1,200. And one of the perks of getting, being one of the first to buy the phone was you got this saga Genesis NFT, which made you eligible for all kinds of airdrops. And I think the dollar amount is like, you got at least $1,200 worth of airdrops between bonk Clanosaurus nfts and different things like that. So sales came to a complete halt for probably like a three or four month period before q four of last year. And people were like, oh, my God, this thing is dead. But then soul's price started going up, and you had a couple of manipulative people on Twitter, like, these are scarce nfts. Essentially, the saga is a scarce fungible token because it's a physical thing.
00:24:18.526 - 00:25:21.858, Speaker A: So people started aping into the phone and they sold out, which is like, great, awesome. You sold like 20,000 phones or whatever. But now they're launching the second wave of phones and you can preorder them for, I think, $450, but they don't ship until the first half of 2025. And to add some podsification to this, they're like, if you order the phone, you get this referral link. And the more people you refer to buy the phone, the more points you get, which can later be used to count towards your Genesis NFT, which was initially supposed to go to the Genesis purchasers of the first saga phone. And this is actually the third price decrease on the saga phones because they dropped the price like, halfway through last year because sales completely stopped. So the strategy here for the saga phone is just kind of ambiguous at this point.
00:25:21.858 - 00:26:02.880, Speaker A: It's like, please, Solana devs, if you're building something, airdrop something to the saga phone people so they have a reason to buy. But it's also like, by the way, please refer people after you buy your saga. We'll give you points. We need to end points. Points are so overdone and so, like, is this a consumer facing phone? Is this an NFT? Is this like, a scarce value thing? There's no clear product strategy for what the saga phone is at this point and I feel like it's just been really forced. In reality, I do not want to use an Android phone right now. I like the blue text.
00:26:02.880 - 00:26:06.340, Speaker A: That's all I have to say about this.
00:26:08.390 - 00:26:48.922, Speaker D: Yeah, I definitely want to reiterate, we're done with points, please. I feel like I see a new point system pop up every day and it's really getting annoying as a user. But at the same time, I can understand why team want to do points because it incentivizes more activity. But at a certain point, people stop caring and they leave your application. You need to obviously launch your token at the correct time. But yeah, I'm definitely just done with points. But on the saga phone specifically, I'd be curious if there's a lot of the original phones being sold on eBay, et cetera.
00:26:48.922 - 00:27:36.480, Speaker D: I'd wonder if obviously the floor prices of the phone started dropping once this went live because you had basically, what, two x in the total number of phones being launched. But I do think at the same time, like you said, this is sort of a little bit forced, but I do think a lot of projects that are going to be focused on the mobile aspect of things are going to airdrop to saga holders. And so I think at a price of 450, it probably could be lucrative in that sense. But at the same time, you have to wait a whole year to even get your phone. You're probably not even going to use the phone anyway. You're just going to take the airdrop tokens, sell them into USDC. Yeah, I definitely have a lot of question marks too on this.
00:27:38.050 - 00:28:30.574, Speaker E: I do think like, even though it's probably forced and salon is definitely trying to play this playbook of being like the deep end chain and it's maybe not this version of saga phone, but I could definitely see a future iteration of saga phone, obviously like partner with helium. I think the first saga phone did that in one way, shape or form. Maybe like leveraging hive mapper. I can definitely see a bunch of deep in projects that are building on Solana starting to build their own sensors and then kind of starting to actually help build the parts of the saga phone overall. So it actually becomes like, I don't know, like a Solana phone that's built by the developers of major deepen protocols on. So there definitely is something there, I think. I'm not a really big fan of points either, but I also see the idea of trying to gamify and growing the adoption of the saga phone.
00:28:30.574 - 00:28:42.180, Speaker E: I haven't looked into any of the details, like, is this version. It's cheaper, but does it have any new features or anything cool that is unique, or is it just like another Android phone?
00:28:42.550 - 00:28:44.100, Speaker A: I think it's just another.
00:28:46.630 - 00:29:20.894, Speaker E: I mean, I do think mobile adoption of crypto is like the future. I would really love to see Coinbase try to create their own Coinbase phone eventually. That's leveraging the full dpin stack, leveraging rweave or filecoin for storage instead of using Apple cloud. There's definitely a product there and I think it's really brave that Solana kind of went out originally to try to build this. Maybe it's a little too early and they're trying to just catch a narrative and raise capital, which I also get to. It's probably just too early. But at the same time, the original Apple iPhone was way too early.
00:29:20.894 - 00:29:54.780, Speaker E: It was way ahead of its time. It only spoke to a really niche market. But look how big the Apple iPhone ended up being. You got to dominate. Their marketing campaigns are extremely crypto native, but that's exactly what you need to do. You need to get your initial hype fans that are going to live and die by the saga phone and then eventually it becomes like worldwide phenomenon. It's probably overdone to the points play, but I also see why they're doing it because, let's be honest, all of us are crypto djens and this is what we like to see.
00:29:55.710 - 00:30:09.920, Speaker D: I also think the airdrops kind of ruined that aspect of things because you have people buying like five of these phones just to get the airdrops. So any organic activity coming from mobile I don't think is really going to be there.
00:30:10.930 - 00:31:00.960, Speaker A: And back to the Coinbase mobile point. I think it is really interesting because base had a couple of apps that launched that you could add to your home screen on an iPhone. So obviously there's friendtech and then there was like friend pet. And clearly the security was not great on that compared to Saga's MPC wallet that they have. But I think that's kind of the way for mobile strategy right now, is to do something where you add it to the home screen, you're getting past the Apple App Store and you're still getting distribution to basically anyone with the phone. So I think there's way lower barriers to entry doing it that way versus going and creating this kind of prehistoric hardware that just can't compete with anything else.
00:31:02.050 - 00:31:19.874, Speaker C: Yeah, that's where the case kind of gets lost for me. It's like you're not going to take away my blue text messages. It's not going to happen. I love the iPhone. All my friends have an iPhone. It works with all of my devices seamlessly, like AirPods, iwatch, Mac. There's no way that's getting replicated.
00:31:19.874 - 00:31:40.780, Speaker C: But I will say I'm excited about Solana trying to do something different. It's just very exhausting seeing a million of the same amms pop up, the same perps, Dexs, the same NFT marketplaces. So I'll at least give them a hat tip for trying something new. But effort. What do you got in the hot seat or cool threat this week?
00:31:41.230 - 00:32:36.574, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll put the Cosmos hub and the atom asset on the hot seat. So there's been a lot of talk, obviously, about Eigen layer and e three staking and abs and what have you. Again, I think 99% of the crypto population has no idea what any of these actually are, but they're going to bid Eigen layer two a trillion dollars. But just this week, a project named Ethos, which I believe was incubated by polychain, but don't hold me to that. I could be wrong there. They're a Cosmos app chain that came out of stealth that's going to be built pretty much an Eigen layer, Abs, that's going to offer shared security to Cosmos app chains. So pretty much you can delegate your ETH, restake it to ethos, and then ethos operators can offer shared security, cheaper shared security to cosmos app chains than potentially the Cosmos hub can.
00:32:36.574 - 00:33:16.762, Speaker E: So this is obviously really worrisome for the Cosmos hub as the original vision for it was to become a shared security provider. There was really no Ethereum was offering shared security to roll ups. But there was always, like, external competition for the Cosmos hub outside the cosmos ecosystem. But now there's, like, internal competition. If ethos comes in, brings eth, liquidity brings Eth security, and it's going to be really interesting to see. Will Cosmos have chains and Cosmos developers? It really becomes an alignment game at the end of the day, and also a cost game, too. But I'm really curious to see what's going to be a cheaper solution and what is going to be like.
00:33:16.762 - 00:34:16.426, Speaker E: Will Cosmos developers decide to align with the hub regardless of all the drama it's historically had, or will they decide to align with a newer, shinier shared security solution that has the promises of potentially aligning themselves, like Ethereum ecosystem and Ethereum capital? Again, I'm a Cosmos hub bull overall, but I definitely think ethos coming in, and I think they're going to be launching sometime in late Q one, early Q two. With a couple of consumer chains right off the bat. So definitely something to be worried about if I was solely in Atom. But Adam also does have a couple of things on the horizon, like opt in security, which is going to offer permissionless security, shared security. So today, consumer chains have to ask Cosmos Hub governance to join the shared security offering. But I know in the next couple of quarters it's going to be completely permissionless. Operators can decide what consumer chains to secure and whatnot.
00:34:16.426 - 00:34:52.250, Speaker E: That should lower the cost of security. That should make the Cosmos hub's offering more scalable, but it doesn't have know allure and also eigen layer. Like the whole narrative is brand new and shiny. So definitely worrisome for the I think, you know, even though shared security is going to be a commoditized market, at the end of the day, brand is a powerful thing. And I would say right now Adam's brand is not as strong as it really should. And even though it has all the fundamentals, in my opinion, it's just lacking that clear narrative.
00:34:54.190 - 00:35:10.346, Speaker D: Is that the only thing these app chains are going to be thinking about when deciding between something like ethos and the hub? Is it just like brand and narrative? Are there other specific differences between implementations or between sort of ETH as an asset and atom as an asset?
00:35:10.538 - 00:36:10.690, Speaker E: Yeah, obviously it's ETH, right? It's like the unicorn outside of bitcoin for the entire crypto space outside of brand and alignment. It also is going to come down to cost. So if you're an ETH staker today, you're already getting 3% plus yield just from staking your ETH. And you're maybe willing to offer your ETH security at a cheaper cost per capital than an Atom staker, because an Atom staker is not getting this 3% plus yield like they're only strictly getting yield through inflation and not transaction fees or what have you. So I definitely think cost is going to come into play, and I also think people don't want to deal with governance. So I'm really looking forward to see what the optimum security solution looks like for the Cosmos hub. I've been talking really closely with Jahan, who's like the lead developer for the Cosmos hub in that aspect.
00:36:10.690 - 00:36:55.470, Speaker E: But I think it's going to be interesting to see dual security models. So if you're osmosis, you can actually leveraging ethos, you can have not only Osmo tokens, secure your app chain, you could also have securing your app chain as well. So you're going to start seeing security aggregation where multiple assets are securing given abs or given app chains. And at the end of the day, what would you rather have secure your app chain today? Would you rather have ETH or Adam? Even though I'm an Atom bull, I probably take ETH just because it's a more Lindy asset overall, even though I think Adam is still an incredibly Lindy asset, given it hasn't done much historically and still has a multi billion dollar market cap. But it's really hard to just fight the network effects.
00:36:57.430 - 00:37:18.040, Speaker D: What are some reasons why an app chain would create sort of a cosmos chain and then pay for security from Atom or ETH versus having a roll up, maybe a sovereign roll up that inherents security from Celestia or maybe ETH and doesn't have to pay inflation over time. Are there other considerations there?
00:37:18.490 - 00:38:44.082, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think right now I've said this a lot, but I think until we actually see a decentralized roll up, I'm not ready to call roll ups cheaper than app chains. I might get flamed for saying this in the comments, but all a roll up is going to be is an app chain with like three or four validators or like ten validators that are sequencing the transactions. Yes, you have maybe different security assumptions, a sequencer versus like a full stack validator. But yeah, obviously right now I would say if you truly believe in decentralization, roll ups just aren't ready. And I would also argue that a lot of roll up frameworks just aren't ready yet for mainstream the op stack is probably the closest to compete with the Cosmos SDK, but the Cosmos SDK is still like the best app specific blockchain framework in crypto today. And I think for the foreseeable future that's going to remain the case. But I could definitely see a point where you launch as an app chain, you find some product market fit, leveraging whatever shared security solution you want, and then maybe as these roll app frameworks, like through dimension or through roll kit or something, find maturity and economics are a little more figured out, then you kind of pivot to a sovereign roll up over time.
00:38:44.082 - 00:38:46.660, Speaker E: But yeah.
00:38:48.550 - 00:39:00.060, Speaker C: Sorry, we're kind of hammering your questions here. Effort. But whatever happened with Adam one, is that like getting any, like, has that forked the community in any substantial way? Since we last spoke about it, nothing's happened.
00:39:01.550 - 00:39:46.760, Speaker E: I think the JQuan is still kind of working on it. There's like GitHub forums going back and forth where the community is talking about it. But I think that there's a pretty big delineation or a big separation between those that are for Adam one and those that are mostly for Adam. And I would say a very small minority is actually interested in Adam one, even though the decrease in inflation proposal was a pretty even split, 50 50. I think a lot of the people that were against lowering the inflation that ultimately led to the separation and the creation of Adam one, I think a lot of people that were against the inflation prop weren't so against it that they're willing to kind of leave Adam. They are more so just like voicing their opinion, like, hey, we don't want to decrease inflation. But I also think they know that.
00:39:46.760 - 00:40:26.710, Speaker E: I think Jay has kind of spread his resources thin and probably doesn't have the same. Not just the bandwidth, but the ability and resources to actually stand up like a legitimate competitor to the hub. So I'm pretty bearish on Adam one. Everyone was trying to, like all the narrative shills on Twitter were trying to say how Adam won airdrop is bullish the hub. I mean, look, I'm like a big I mid curve everything. I just don't understand how that's a narrative at all. There's so many other real narratives for the hub, but I sometimes don't understand how this market thinks.
00:40:28.570 - 00:40:40.406, Speaker C: That's pretty funny, actually. I think that narrative in quotations for the listeners. I'm doing quotations with my fingers. I think that was just on your timeline effort, because I didn't see that literally at all.
00:40:40.588 - 00:41:01.182, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? March is approaching fast, and I want to give you another reminder not to miss out on Das London. It is coming. It's right around the corner, and it's in March. From the 18th through the 20th, we have three full days of content. This is your chance to bump shoulders with some of the world's top executives and have open dialogue with both attendees and speakers. We're going to be focusing on a range of topics that I'll let Ren discuss for you.
00:41:01.236 - 00:41:38.010, Speaker F: First on the list, we have bitcoin catalyst, the halving, and spot ETF. Next, we have a view from the buy side from investors on things like strategy, portfolio allocation, and more. We also have a topic on rwas, tokenization and stablecoins, which I think we can all agree are going to pay large role in crypto's future. We'll also talk about global regulatory frameworks like compliance, best practices, and the evolution of global standards that are shaping the global investment landscape. We'll also have someone from the institutional front to talk about infrastructure, such as banking and payments, with financial giants like Visa and Morgan. And last on the list, the macro case for digital assets. So don't miss out on this monumental event.
00:41:38.010 - 00:41:47.082, Speaker F: Seats are limited, so be sure to register today by hitting the link in the description and using the promo code zero x ten to save 10% on tickets. See you in London.
00:41:47.146 - 00:41:49.070, Speaker C: Wesley, who you got in the hot seat? Cool throne.
00:41:49.570 - 00:42:27.242, Speaker D: Yeah, I can take over here. I actually have arbitram in the hot seat. In full disclosure, we're big delegates. We love arbitram. But there's something that passed snapshot the other day, which was a new long term incentive program. So LTIP, as they're calling it, and they voted basically to put out 45 million ARB, which is roughly $100 million, to give as incentives for these protocols. So the proposal looks locked in to pass snapshot right now, but we'll still have a substantial process before the incentives actually start.
00:42:27.242 - 00:42:59.718, Speaker D: So you have like a three week tally vote, a six week application process between then and then. Unknown operational overhead. Yeah. To me, the reason why I put them in the hot seat is this kind of seems like frivolous spending, especially after the stip program was just a few months ago. And the whole point of that program was to figure out what kind of incentives drove the best outcomes for arbitram as a whole. This program was. I feel like something like this program should build on the previous process.
00:42:59.718 - 00:43:34.980, Speaker D: This one only builds off the application process itself, which did have a lot of issues, but it did no work in figuring out what the outcomes were, how incentives affected certain outcomes, et cetera, which I think is the most important part. But whether or not you agree with the spending is still something you need to keep your eye out for. Just like the steps were last year, where we can see which protocols stand to benefit the most from having these incentives. So it's going to be something to look out for, but overall, not the biggest fan. What do you guys think about it?
00:43:35.990 - 00:44:18.670, Speaker A: I think we can see a good example of what happens with this last round of op, retroactive rewards and how some of the bodies came to the surface. And it's like these totally fake causes and fake initiatives come out, and it's like, oh, they got paid like a quarter million dollars to do what? The website is not even active anymore for their project. And I think this opens the door for a lot of that to happen later down the road. I mean, it's probably happening right now. So it's not a great look. But at the end of the day, I'm glad this arb is vesting into the community instead of vesting into VC wallets.
00:44:21.490 - 00:44:54.182, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's my stamp of approval on it, honestly. It's just kind of more evenly distributing the supply to users because this is specifically targeted towards the end users, which I think is a pro. I also like spending treasury more so in bull markets than I do so in bear, just to get the most bang for your buck. And I think arbs run up pretty substantially since the lows like three, four x. So I don't mind spending a little bit, but it does feel like there's quite a few cooks in the kitchen. Over in the arbitram dow. There's like new proposals up every other day, and a lot of it involves heavy treasury spending.
00:44:54.182 - 00:45:11.440, Speaker C: Like Westy said, we don't really know what the last diffs program, what the real conclusions were on effectiveness. And I also have a question, because I don't know why it's called a long term incentives program. Are they like looking to. Yeah, why is it called that? It's the same thing. They have to spend it within 14 weeks, right?
00:45:11.970 - 00:45:40.570, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's just longer than the short term incentive program. And I think they're also implying that this will be continuous, right. That there'll be funding once this is over. And to me, that just indicates the treasury is just a revolving door of spending more money and spending more money until there's a process in place of seeing where the clear outcomes are, where incentives are being best spent. Until we do that, then the spending is frivolous, in my opinion.
00:45:41.310 - 00:46:01.790, Speaker A: I have a request that someone who receives this ltip creates like an RWA platform on Arbitrum, where I can stake some stables for 5% APY, but also get ARB rewards on top. Pick something useful for me that sweetens the deal on some stablecoin yield.
00:46:04.210 - 00:47:00.530, Speaker E: One thing I'm thinking about is all these incentive programs like optimism throwing at developers and builders and users arbitrarium as well, obviously. How does base combat that? I don't think Coinbase is going to be spending $100 million unless they come out with like a base token, which obviously I think they said no, but I'd have to speculate they do that eventually. Assuming that they don't launch a token, what is the incentive to build on base over arbitram giving out $100 million in a 14 week period? That's crazy. And we're calling that a pilot project, which is not a pilot, but yeah. Curious what you guys thought. Do you think developers are actually going to choose to build a basis because of the coin based branding, or do you think they're going to follow the incentives?
00:47:01.350 - 00:47:22.486, Speaker A: I think the incentive is distribution in a world where base gets a ton of users, but that experience needs to be beefed up substantially. But distribution is a far greater incentive than cold hard tokens in your wallet. If you're truly passionate about what you're building and want to see genuine usage.
00:47:22.518 - 00:47:40.240, Speaker E: Of your platform, that last part is the asterisk that I agree with, but whatever. I'm not a builder in web3, I'm just a researcher and I love the space. But do we actually think majority of developers are actually here for a long time or are they here for a good time?
00:47:40.610 - 00:47:46.000, Speaker A: The meaningful ones have a huge ego and they're here for the long run.
00:47:47.650 - 00:47:48.400, Speaker E: Fair?
00:47:48.870 - 00:47:58.280, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd agree with pibbles'take. I think it's distribution over short term incentives, but it'll be interesting to see how that actually plays out.
00:48:01.610 - 00:48:32.320, Speaker D: Yeah, I think like on something like arbitrum, the whole idea is to attract users to the chain, whereas with base the whole idea is that Coinbase has the users already. They just need to take them and onboard them into web3, and with that they'll go to base. So either way, as a developer, you're either hoping to attract new people to the chain you're building on, or in base's case, be at a place that the users hopefully are just easily funneled to. The whole idea is we want users as an application.
00:48:34.370 - 00:49:06.326, Speaker C: It'd be pretty cool to see arbitram when they launch these incentive programs to juice the amount of fees that they charge users and then just take the extra delta that they're earning as revenue, because then you're kind of getting some of the value of your arb token back and it's also in an exogenous collateral in ETH. So it's a bit like selling tokens, but without selling tokens. Just an idea. If anyone in Arbitrum is listening to this, maybe throw it on the forum. But anyways, does anyone else have anything else to add to that right there, or am I ready to go into my hotsql?
00:49:06.358 - 00:49:54.838, Speaker E: Then the only thing I'm going to say is there's two really lengthy forum posts on Arbitrum's forums around treasury management, one by the era finance gauntlet team, and the other one by Karpatki, that I think everyone should definitely read because I think when you're talking about 100 million dollar grant programs, when you're talking about the stips, I forgot exactly what the total amount for stips was. They're paying an ARB. That's a considerable amount of sell pressure for the ARB token, which obviously is like negatively reflexive flywheels. Like more sell pressure on ARB, Arb goes down. That's less grant capital for future initiatives. But really well thought out and thorough forum posts around how to allocate the treasury properly. How do you actually leverage protocol liquidity? Create deeper liquidity for ARB so that it can fund these initiatives for a longer time frame.
00:49:54.838 - 00:49:58.540, Speaker E: But just wanted to bring that up because I thought they were really good reads this morning.
00:50:00.110 - 00:50:33.586, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll be sure to link to those in the show notes. I'll have to grab those from you effort after we stop recording here, but I'll move on to my cool throne, I guess. Actually the only cool throne of the day I've got blur about $30 million worth of tokens unlocked yesterday. So that makes 18% of the total supply having vested and unlocked since June 15, which I saw that from Wu blockchain on Twitter and was pretty surprised. That's like a substantial amount of tokens, but the price is up huge. It's up from a low of $0.15 about a year ago or so, up to $0.72
00:50:33.586 - 00:51:07.022, Speaker C: today. So that's been a fantastic trade. And all of this without revenue share yet. And I think that this is just a generally really good play if you're bullish on nfts at all, I think that funds will probably use this as a proxy index token for NFT exposure, which Pibbles has actually called out for literally since the token, honestly, before the token launched. So hat tip to you, pibbles, but I think they'd rather hold those than no liquid jpegs. But on the other hand, that's less buyers in the market. So maybe that's kind of more bearish for NFT volume.
00:51:07.022 - 00:51:47.630, Speaker C: So maybe those two balance each other out. But I think generally speaking, NFT marketplaces have a huge redemption arc this cycle. We have never seen revenue share with NFT marketplaces during a bull run. And for some context, Openc was bringing tens of millions over $40 million a month of revenue during a bull, and all that was just going to the company behind OpenC. So for extra context, on top of that, DYDX put in like $80 million of earnings over last year. That's just like NFT marketplaces were bringing in way more revenue than perps. Even so I think put a revenue share on that and you kind of get a really nice set up for blur basically.
00:51:47.630 - 00:52:23.850, Speaker C: And then on top of that, the same founder, Pac Man, I believe is behind blast. Please correct me if I'm wrong there. I might be botching that, but I think that kind of plays into the blur narrative a little bit. Even though Blast will probably launch its own token, I think that there'll be some synergies between the two. So yeah, generally speaking, like Tenzer Blur, like these pro style NFT marketplaces that are genuinely better than the competition on their chains, I think they'll do really well because they have genuinely good products and I think that funds that want exposure to this stuff will definitely be opting for the token over the nfts. But not sure if anyone here has thoughts on blur.
00:52:24.350 - 00:53:01.062, Speaker A: Yeah, I would just add to that blast testnet actually got announced, so that's probably like a huge catalyst for why Blur is doing so well this week. And obviously people knew this last week and you can see it on the chart. But also they're doing this contest for Dapp developers on Blast. Like there's actual judges and they'll be connected with investors. So blast is kind of taking all the necessary steps to have usable things on day one. So I think most of the price auction or action ties back to blast for now. But do second that.
00:53:01.062 - 00:53:09.450, Speaker A: All the NFT index thesis and everything else with Blair is super good reason to have exposure to Blair.
00:53:11.710 - 00:54:36.462, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll also reiterate that Pac man is the founder of both Blur and Blast, and the whole point, at least from him, of building blast is to create a better environment for trading nfts. So having it on a roll up and having native yield for the ETH that's bidding these assets, he thinks it's just a better just platform in general and eventually it'll migrate to blast. But I wonder what that looks like because obviously you're trading nfts that exist on main net, so how would you trade them on a roll up? Maybe you have some sort of like IOU that represents your ownership of the token on l one that maybe is locked in the bridge contract. I'm not really sure what that's going to look like, but I'm interested to see the designs as they come out. But yeah, as pivotal said, they're doing their best to try and have on day one of main net a lot of applications, things to use on main net and with $1.3 billion in the bridge, I believe right now, obviously, there's enough incentive for builders to try and port their application there and try and gain some mind, share some activity, et cetera. And I do think once this thing launches, as much as I don't really like how they went about their whole announcement, et cetera, I do think it's primed for a lot of weird and interesting activity, probably a lot of debauchery, meme coinery, et cetera.
00:54:36.462 - 00:54:46.550, Speaker D: There's $1.3 billion in capital people are just looking to utilize on the chain. And so, yeah, a lot is going to happen, and I'm definitely going to be looking forward to that launch.
00:54:48.970 - 00:55:29.542, Speaker E: Just around not specifically blur, but like, NFT marketplaces in general. Also, I want to quickly put, like, bad kids on the cool throne. So if you guys don't know, bad kids are like the NFT collection for the cosmos ecosystem. And I think Stargaze is like the NFT marketplace app chain of the cosmos ecosystem. They're like OG builders there. I think it's going to be really interesting to see how stars, which is like the stargaze native token, trades along with Blur, especially if there's this whole narrative that blast is like the Blur L two and it gets like an l two valuation and then you're seeing stars. So stars right now is fully diluted at like 135,000,000.
00:55:29.542 - 00:56:06.014, Speaker E: Val, Blur is at like two point something billion right now. And obviously Blur has, like, the allure of being an Ethel two, an ethereum NFT marketplace. It does a lot more volume and revenue than stargaze, for sure. Orders of magnitude. But I do think that stars could be like a catch up play or it might get a re rating with Blur continuing to increase in value, especially off the back of blast. And also, bad kids has become, again like the NFT collection owned in the Cosmos ecosystem. If you own a bad kid, you've already received a Tia airdrop.
00:56:06.014 - 00:56:28.070, Speaker E: You're going to receive a dimension airdrop. You already received a Namada Airdrop. And I think you're starting to see that everyone that is launching a Cosmos app chain is airdropping to bad kids holders. And there's a couple other collections tied to the bad kids collection as well. Like Bitkids is one. They're pretty cool. I've owned one.
00:56:28.070 - 00:56:48.318, Speaker E: I think the floor right now is like $4,000. I think there was like a free mint when it first went live. So just really interesting, something interesting to see, and I'm pretty bullish. Overall on the Stargaze platform and the developers over there. But since we were talking about Blur, I thought it was good to bring up Stargaze and bad kids.
00:56:48.484 - 00:57:07.910, Speaker A: I used Stargaze one time to mint stargaze troopers like two years ago. They were like a stargaze validator. I just checked their Twitter account. They have not tweeted since July 2022. I think I'm done with Stargaze.
00:57:09.930 - 00:57:25.014, Speaker C: I just bent the knee and bought one, actually, so that means all the airdrops are probably in the rear view mirror. So full disclosure for anyone looking to buy one. And I just said a bid in too. And I think I got the ugliest one in the entire collection, so that was pretty unfortunate.
00:57:25.062 - 00:57:26.970, Speaker E: Honestly, that's bullish.
00:57:27.870 - 00:57:37.850, Speaker C: Do you know what the token I guess supply looks like for stars? Out of curiosity, effort, like how much of that is vested? Is anything set aside for incentives?
00:57:38.010 - 00:57:48.850, Speaker E: I'm not going to lie, I don't know, off top of my head, but maybe we can include it in the show notes in a link if I could find the supply contract or like the supply schedule.
00:57:49.190 - 00:57:59.942, Speaker C: Cool, that sounds good. All right, well, I think that's a good spot to end it. Wes D. Pibbles effort thanks for coming on as always and taking an hour out of your day. We will chat with you guys next week.
