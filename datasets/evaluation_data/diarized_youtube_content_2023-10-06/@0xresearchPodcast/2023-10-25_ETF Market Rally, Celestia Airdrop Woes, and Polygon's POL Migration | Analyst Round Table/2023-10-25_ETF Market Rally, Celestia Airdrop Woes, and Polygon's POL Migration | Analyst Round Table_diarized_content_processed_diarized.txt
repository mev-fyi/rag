00:00:00.250 - 00:00:24.994, Speaker A: I think Polygon's dead if they don't, you know, somehow develop some sort of ecosystem fund. Like, you just can't compete with arbitram, optimism, etc. Being able to hand out token incentives and bring users over to your chain, I just. I can't get over that point. Like, even if you look at Gains Network, that was a Polygon native protocol that migrated over to Arbitrum as well. They have two versions live every single day. It's 85% of volume on Arbitrum.
00:00:24.994 - 00:00:56.558, Speaker A: They literally just got a stip worth. I can't even remember. It's in the five to $10 million range. If you're not getting that on Polygon, why wouldn't you be on arbitrage? Hey, everyone, Sam and Dan here. And before we dive into today's episode, I wanted to shout out metamask portfolio. Are you always constantly stressed like us, managing your portfolio across different chains, wallets, lp positions, perps positions? I'm excited to tell you about metamask portfolio, which lets you manage all of your crypto assets across different networks, wallets, all in one place.

00:01:27.730 - 00:02:05.494, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We got a great analyst episode queued up for you today. We're joined by Zero X Pibbles and Ren from the Blockworks research team. We're recording this on today, October 23, and so this episode will drop in two days on the following Wednesday, on October 25.

00:02:05.494 - 00:02:23.190, Speaker B: We just launched a new analytics tab we'll get into a bit of that a little later on in the episode. We're going through some of our governance updates, but do be sure to check it out. At the very least, scroll through our twitter. We got a lot of our good stuff going through that pipeline. But to kick things off today, we'll do a little top mover, biggest loser. So, Sam, I'll kick it over to you to get us moving.
00:02:23.260 - 00:02:50.434, Speaker A: Yeah, for the mover, this one felt like a pretty easy one this week. Bitcoin dominance, definitely in the driver's seat. It feels like we're nearing up to, like 53%, which is the highest level we've seen in a while, as people who have been here in previous cycles are familiar with. Usually bitcoin dominance goes up and then altcoins kind of rally towards the more frothier part of the market. So it's always encouraging to see that price action. We saw Blackrock made an amendment to their s one. Not sure what the hell an s one is, so don't ask me.
00:02:50.434 - 00:03:30.494, Speaker A: But basically to seed the ETF with some cash so it looks closer to approval. Not sure if that has much legs or not, but nonetheless, people on Twitter were talking about it, so it seemed important. Plus, CME futures, open interest, which in my opinion is the best gauge at, I guess, us institutional demand more on the tradfi side is at highest levels since early 2022. And you've got bitcoin supply on exchanges at a five year low, which I found super interesting. So, yeah, bitcoin dominance, definitely the top mover this week, but we've also got movers out of link and Seoul, both kind of moving pretty hard. I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on this section here.
00:03:30.612 - 00:04:05.738, Speaker B: So you just mentioned the amount of bitcoin on exchanges, and with bitcoin, there's only so much on chain analytics you can really do, but people try to get every inch of, really squeeze every drop of water out of that. And so the bitcoin on exchange is one I find quite interesting because I get the idea behind it. Right. If you're sending tokens to an exchange, you're one step closer to selling them. So that's kind of like a fear metric. But how much credence do you guys give to that metric of being like, oh, if there's a ton of bitcoin on exchanges, look out below, or if there's little to no bitcoin on exchanges, well, that means that nobody's going to.
00:04:05.744 - 00:04:47.334, Speaker C: Sell, to be honest, not really. I would even go so far to say all of those fancy metrics that they have for bitcoin on coin glass or that one website with a ton of fancy minor or whatever metrics. I don't really look at that. I feel like it's kind of like overthinking it even like coin holder days. And they've now multiplied that by something else. I think it's just too complicated. You just have to at this point of the market with a spot bitcoin ETF coming up, right? We had the whole coin telegraph, like fake bitcoin ETF news last Monday, and I think this weekend's move was sort of like an after effect of that.
00:04:47.372 - 00:04:47.526, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:47.548 - 00:05:09.326, Speaker C: I'm not sure if this move would have happened without that coin Telegraph move because that thing got announced, the market pumped 7.5% and then everyone's like, oh shit, what if the real spot bitcoin ETF gets announced? I don't want to be sidelined off like a 1015 percent pump. And so the market, people start deploying, people start buying in because they don't want to miss out on the real thing and it just results in the price slowly going up.
00:05:09.428 - 00:05:48.380, Speaker D: Yeah, on the Blackrock ETF thing. So Sam said that s one filing had an amendment about seeding the initial product with cash. So I think it specified, it said like October blank, which kind of implies that they're going to use cash to buy a ton of bitcoin potentially in October, which makes sense if you're going to start this product, first you got to get the actual asset that you're offering exposure to. But I'm curious to see what the custody situation is for that because we're all kind of assuming Coinbase and hopefully that's the case.
00:05:48.750 - 00:06:23.782, Speaker B: Yeah, another interesting thing that I noticed here. Know the holiday season is right around the corner, so I got to start prepping my responses to, wow, do you still have a job? And that started with pulling up the sp versus bitcoin year to date performance. The sp is up 11% and bitcoin is up 86%. I knew we've been performing well since a lot of the fallout from last year, but damn, that's a big margin. That one feels good. And I will absolutely be using that chart. And that doesn't quite look the same for ETH as well, by the way.
00:06:23.782 - 00:06:32.218, Speaker B: I don't have the ETH chart pulled up in front of me, but bitcoin has had a great year and so it's no surprise that dominance is really kind of kicking us forward here.
00:06:32.384 - 00:06:33.178, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely.
00:06:33.264 - 00:07:02.302, Speaker A: Plus, I was writing the newsletter earlier this morning, which, by the way, everyone should subscribe to if they haven't already. It's very good. But basically the share of hash rate owned by public miners is at an all time high right now because they're kind of buying the distressed, less well financed miners assets. So I think they're going to perform super well. And they already have. They're actually outperforming bitcoin pretty much by double. So I'm sure that's definitely catching some traditional financial market players eye kind of thinking.
00:07:02.302 - 00:07:12.178, Speaker A: Man, this is like really high beta to an already really volatile doll asset. So maybe adding a 0.5% allocation there would make a lot of sense. But I think that's a good spot to head over to the biggest.
00:07:12.274 - 00:07:31.738, Speaker B: I want to add some more context there. So I just quickly pulled it up, and ETH is actually up 40%. So it's kind of straddling the 11% of the SP and the 86% of bitcoin. And so, interestingly, the Nasdaq is also right around 40% at 35. So ETH is kind of trading more like tech stocks, whereas bitcoin is just beaten to its own drum. Very interesting.
00:07:31.904 - 00:08:06.662, Speaker A: That is interesting, actually, I wouldn't have guessed ETH to be on par with kind of the mega caps in the stock market, but that's a good call out, Dan. But for losers, I've got just sideline, folks. That's pretty much the only loser I could think of because everything else is up today. And I'm sure when this drops Wednesday, a wrench will be thrown in this commentary. But nonetheless, on Monday, that's definitely the way things are panning out. I'm curious, just based on the sentiment you guys see on CT, does anyone have any, I guess, projections or predictions on what percent of crypto Twitter participants are sidelined on this move?
00:08:06.796 - 00:08:45.698, Speaker B: I just don't know how you can be sidelined when you sit here and if you're posting tweets all day, you got to be exposed or you get way too much enjoyment out of just shit talking online. I've been saying life is a lot easier when you're already all in for six months now, seven months. So I got to imagine that it's a majority of people just based on the sentiment we're seeing on CT. I don't know, maybe it's about half and half. I take it back because I feel like for every one bull post I see, I get another one that's just like pure depression. And I'm like, all right, just allocate. Why are you waiting? If you think something's going to ten x, you have no business waiting for a 10% move lower.
00:08:45.698 - 00:08:49.102, Speaker B: Just get in. Not financial advice at all. I'm a horrible trader.
00:08:49.166 - 00:09:09.260, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd agree with that to some extent. But I also think when you're sitting there looking at this stuff day in and day out, you can kind of drive yourself absolutely insane looking at price action, and the industry moves so fast that I could definitely see yourself overthinking it and waiting for lower prices. But any other thoughts on this here?
00:09:09.630 - 00:09:21.840, Speaker D: I just think from experience, watching everything rip and not having any exposure to it is probably more painful than actually losing money on something, which is why I got in.
00:09:22.770 - 00:09:25.182, Speaker A: The Fomo is real. I definitely agree.
00:09:25.316 - 00:09:53.974, Speaker B: All right, everyone, let's take a moment to hear about metamask portfolio. If you're like me and Sam, managing your crypto assets across different wallets and networks can be so overwhelmingly complicated. That's why we're excited about Metamask portfolio. All you have to do is connect your metamask wallet to get a bird's eye view of all your coins, tokens, and nfts in one place. You can easily buy, sell, swap, bridge, and stake crypto assets at competitive rates, all within the app. And you get to choose from a vetted list of providers. There's no more jumping between dozens of sites and apps.
00:09:53.974 - 00:10:01.754, Speaker B: Metamask portfolio lets you do more in web3 your way, giving you secure and convenient access to a wide range of features and services, all within one place.
00:10:01.872 - 00:10:11.678, Speaker A: Manage your portfolio your way with Metamask portfolio. Peep the link in the description of today's episode to get started. Now, Dan, you got some governance updates for us? This.
00:10:11.764 - 00:10:53.882, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure. So we can start things off. Adam always has pretty crazy tokenomic discussions or honestly, just governance forums on the whole. But right now, they're discussing a proposal to lower the hard cap inflation. So they want to lower the max bound of the dynamic inflation from 20% to 10%, and the current inflation is sitting around 14%. So this would basically, right, if it were to be implemented, it would immediately reduce Adam's inflation by about 30%. And so, compared to other proof of stake chains, the hub is vastly overplaying for security by about two to three times because most chains are somewhere between the range of, like, 5% to 7% of inflation.
00:10:53.882 - 00:11:36.998, Speaker B: And so obviously, this is a very heated discussion because it directly impacts the bottom line for validators. And so they're obviously going to be a little bit reluctant to just reduce their net income. That's a pretty understandable position for them. But the reality is, if the hub is just like throwing tokens out the window for no particular reason, probably some reason to kind of throttle that back and maybe reduce the amount of security that they need to be reduce the security budget essentially. So we'll wait for effort capital to come back on and give us his full thoughts next week. But that is definitely worth something pointing out if you're going to see a 30% reduction in the inflation rate of atom. And then we also have Ibuco, which is the leading Dex on Starknet by volume.
00:11:36.998 - 00:12:06.530, Speaker B: They had a recent proposal to kind of make a 3 million token contribution from the Dow to collect uni tokens themselves. So basically they're saying, all right, we'll take on 3 million uni tokens and provide you 20% of our protocol's future governance token, which is a really interesting proposition. And so I personally don't feel too strongly about this, but Sam and pipples, I know you guys both kind of have two different perspectives on here, so I'd love to get the breakdown.
00:12:06.870 - 00:12:36.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I can start first here. To be honest, I've never used Ibuco, so I can't say I have like a super strong yes. Opinion. But I see all this drama going on in the Uniswap Dao, and they have so many uni tokens in that treasury and token holders just have virtually zero rights. So I don't know, a treasury swap kind of makes sense to me. Plus, you'd imagine in the next year or two, Starknet will pick up a lot of steam as one of the few differentiated l two s and a potential air job coming as well. So I kind of like it.
00:12:36.334 - 00:12:54.994, Speaker A: But then again, token holders really don't have that great of rights. So even if they do do, like a treasury swap for a future allocation thing, I don't know how much benefit it actually has. But the way I'm seeing this right now is just like, just try something. And if this can accrue some value to the uni token sometime down the line, I think that's a win.
00:12:55.192 - 00:14:02.090, Speaker D: So there's a couple of things to unpack here. One is, the founder of Ibuco, used to be a dev at Uniswap back in the day, and then he was an advisor to labs for a little while. So that's like the background of why he popped up in the forum to ask for this. But I think it's a pretty bad deal for uni holders and just like the Dow in general because it's basically just like they're getting, or Ibuco is getting like 3 million seed funding to fund operations for their decks on Starknet. That is not going to really benefit Uni at all. Another thing is Ibuco wants to be considered kind of like a core contributor to Uniswap, which is weird because although they're using their own version of the singleton contract on like it's written in Cairo, so it's going to be kind of hard for them to contribute as a core contributor to Uniswap if everything they did is in a different language. I just don't really see the point of this.
00:14:02.090 - 00:14:28.130, Speaker D: And then further, all right, he wants 3 million uni tokens. He's going to use that to fund his operations, but that's all going to be up to his discretion. There's nothing clarified of what's he actually going to spend it on, what's his projected spend, what a timeline is for a budget or anything. So I think there's just like a lot of red flags with the initial proposal. So it definitely needs to be hashed out more.
00:14:28.280 - 00:15:26.574, Speaker C: Also coming in and chime here, it's not like Starknet has like a thriving DFi ecosystem. Just looking at DFI llama right now, they currently have 33 million in TVL. The top six protocols are Jedi swap, my swap, ZK lend ten k swap, ekubo and sif swap. I guess they have a really strong heart on for Star wars memes, but yeah, I feel like Unisoft is at the stage where they're big enough that they have sort of dominance over the market in terms of spot xs, at least in the vast majority of ecosystems. And they're at the stage where even if someone else does something innovative, Unisoft can just copy it, take it in house, and sort of just price other people out of the competition. Kind of the same thing where Amazon will see a popular product or manufacture it themselves and then they'll sell it themselves rather than letting a third party merchant sell it on Amazon. And I feel like this deal makes no sense for Uniswap, especially given their scale.
00:15:26.574 - 00:15:28.680, Speaker C: They don't benefit a lot from it.
00:15:30.170 - 00:16:05.710, Speaker A: I wonder if some of the rationale though is like, hey, Uniswap, you want some exposure to the starknet ecosystem? I don't even know if Uniswap is actually live on Starknet, so if they are, then this is an old point, but nonetheless I feel like to not have to devote resources to building out something in a completely separate language and just having another team do it that already has 70% of Dex volume on that chain. It's kind of a good way to gain exposure. But definitely hear your guys'concerns with like, yeah, you're just going to give us these tokens and we have no idea what you're doing with them. You're probably just going to sell them and then fund yourself to sit on the couch for a while. Definitely a real risk.
00:16:06.050 - 00:16:31.674, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Those are some good points there. Just a really interesting development, though. We haven't seen a lot of these token swaps go through, especially for larger dows like uniswap. So I don't know, this could have started new precedent if it is a executed and b goes well. So definitely something to keep an eye on. Another governance update we have is ave proposing to further increase the go borrow rate from two and a half percent to 3%.
00:16:31.674 - 00:17:22.438, Speaker B: Lot to think about here because go launched in I think July, June or July time frame roughly earlier this summer, and it has greatly struggled from a peg perspective. So right now it's trading at about 96 six and has just really been down only since launch. They used an artificially low borrow rate when they launched. I think it was around one, one and a half percent. And what that did was create some great initial demand. But everybody what they did was, let's say you borrowed against the eth or whatever your asset was, you'd take out your debt position in go and then immediately sell that on the open market and just either loop the strategy or just get rid of your tokens and go execute some other thing. If I wanted to take some leverage out and go long Eth, I would open a position, borrow some, go against my ETH collateral, and then sell the go for more ETH.
00:17:22.438 - 00:17:55.662, Speaker B: And now I'm holding an increased amount of ETH and have more exposure. And so what this did was just destroy the peg. And so they've already raised the interest rate once and now they have another proposal to go from two and a half to 3%. They also launched without a PSM. And so the PSM is great for upside peg protection, but honestly it doesn't have a huge impact on the downside. Peg protection, really how you solve downside peg protection is like having a robust ecosystem for your token that creates demand for the token. Like you need people to want to hold the token and not just dump it into a liquidity pool.
00:17:55.662 - 00:18:32.000, Speaker B: It's kind of like this really hard problem you're trying to solve. But that is ultimately kind of the goal here. And so the question here is, what went wrong for Ave? How did they really slip up? Because if you look at somebody like curve, who also recently launched a stablecoin earlier this summer, the curvebag has never dropped below like 99 five ish. So a whole $0.03 higher than what go is trading at today. And if you look at what they're doing, well, they have a robust ecosystem of incentives to create that exterior demand and say, hey, go put your assets in this liquidity pool. Don't just go dump them or something like that.
00:18:32.000 - 00:19:31.762, Speaker B: Pair them with another stablecoin and earn yield. And things like conic that sit on top of the curve ecosystem really help promote that. They launched with their Amos, so they're what they call peg keepers. So yes, that's much better for upside peg protection, but you're like launching with a more complete product. And then lastly, they have a much more robust interest rate mechanism that relies on no governance and it's just based on market forces and certain select parameters based on some of initial risk parameters about the asset that you're borrowing against and things like the CRV USD price actually plays a role in the interest rate that the user pays. So you see these two different perspectives and ultimately it's like, all right, well, how do you fix go? And Ave is doing a ton of work going into this. They've created a liquidity committee which is basically like a multi sig of some community participants around.
00:19:31.762 - 00:20:27.874, Speaker B: Like all know we're closely integrated with both curve and balancer. How do we use VCurve or VBAL or some of the yield aggregators like convex or aura that sit on top of those to really kind of create the deepest liquidity we can to help promote peg strength and things like that. Now they're talking about increasing the interest rate again for an additional time, right? Because if you have an artificially low interest rate, people are going to loop SDI or Sfrax yields from you. And again, that's just going to all get sold back and negatively impact the peg. So they're kind of going about the right steps, but so far really lacking in demand. If we look at total demand for again, comparing curve and ave curve USD is at about 125,000,000 of borrowing and we see about 25 million for go itself. So definitely need to see some increase in the peg stability before you're going to see a lot of traction there.
00:20:27.874 - 00:20:29.978, Speaker B: But so far, rough start for Ave.
00:20:30.094 - 00:21:03.038, Speaker A: Yeah, I think SDI and Sfrax, as you said, just completely flipped the stablecoin landscape on its head as we knew it before those two products kind of came to market and I expect that to continue, honestly. As a side note, I just think it's so interesting that the US government is basically indirectly injecting hundreds of thousands of dollars a day into like, that is so cool and so bullish on a longer term timeframe, especially as that scales. And yeah, I'd put myself in the hot seat for what I expected go to do. I thought that was going to be a really successful product and it's pretty much completely flopped front on its face.
00:21:03.204 - 00:21:11.502, Speaker D: Their only hope is to be a third mover and launch escort.
00:21:11.566 - 00:21:17.718, Speaker B: That's a good point, though. I mean, they're going to have to do some sort of off chain asset strategy or RWA strategy, whatever you want to call it.
00:21:17.884 - 00:21:23.698, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, Kanto rolled out an RWA strategy before Ave did and they're.
00:21:23.714 - 00:21:26.150, Speaker B: Moving to the polygon. CDK, baby.
00:21:26.810 - 00:21:33.414, Speaker A: Does anyone know what's good with Ave arc? I haven't heard anything about that. Wasn't that supposed to be like their institutional grade?
00:21:33.542 - 00:22:09.490, Speaker C: I don't think Ave Arc gained any traction at all even though they launched it. I want to say more than a year ago. I think it barely got any assets or TDO in it. I'm not sure if it's entirely shut down, but it seems like more or less dead right now. And I feel like compound also launched like an institutional borrowing solution probably one year ago too. And yeah, that also got shut down pretty early on this year, at the end of last year. So all of these institutions only lending, borrowing protocols, I don't think they've gained any traction.
00:22:09.490 - 00:22:21.126, Speaker C: And I want to say that most of these institutions or hedge funds are still doing their lending and borrowing with just like normal desks such as Amber Group, Falcon X, et cetera. They're not doing it on chain.
00:22:21.238 - 00:22:38.080, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm confused as to why compound is still even like, I don't know a soul who's using it, but there's money in there and they're mining the token. But I mean, now that superstate is a thing, they should just deprecate the whole thing, go start something new.
00:22:38.690 - 00:22:49.540, Speaker A: That might be like a Justin sun place of activity. I think that might be a lot of the TVL. I'm totally like making that up off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure that's where most of the TVL comes from.
00:22:49.910 - 00:22:51.598, Speaker D: I wouldn't be surprised.
00:22:51.774 - 00:23:21.174, Speaker B: But continuing on on the idea of stablecoins, protocol specific stablecoins and their power in DFI. SFrax is up to 40 million in TVl just a week or so after launch. And SDAI is, last I looked, about 1.6 billion, which is insane. To your point, Sam, there's material demand in the middle of a bear market for a product that will get you that treasury rate yield. So that's pretty cool to see. And a little bit of alpha.
00:23:21.174 - 00:24:01.222, Speaker B: Something to watch out for in the governance forms is curve is looking to add SDI and SFrax collateral to their lending market. So you'll be able to execute that looping strategy. There's actually a vote to basically, they're going to use a curve pool as the oracle for that. And so they're deepening liquidity in the SDI CRV USD pool right now, and then that will become the liquidity or, excuse me, the oracle for the SDI collateral. And so right now there's a vote up to add a gauge to that pool for curve. And then you'll see the incentives roll through, liquidity deepen, and then likely the asset will get listed as collateral. So definitely something to keep an eye out there from a governance perspective.
00:24:01.222 - 00:24:36.834, Speaker B: But lastly, on the governance front, we have polygon actually migrating from Maddox to pole. I think the launch is slated for October 25, which is the Wednesday of this week when the episode will go live. So trying to do a little bit of foresight here and see into the future. So don't come after us with the pitchforks if that doesn't end up happening. But that looks like what the game plan will be. It's PiP 26 that suggests increasing the validator rewards by 70 million from 130 to 200 million between now and July 2024. So that 50 million increased to 101,000,000 the following year.
00:24:36.834 - 00:24:57.542, Speaker B: Excuse me. And another 50 million increase the following year from 101 to 150,000,000. So, Sam, I know you've been paying a lot of attention to the polygon and their recent development with the ZKVM and their interop layer and all that. So how do you think this is going to impact the future of the polygon ecosystem?
00:24:57.686 - 00:25:26.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's bullish. I think this is like a necessary migration just to kind of get a new narrative going for Matic and the polygon ecosystem. Just to kind of clarify, PiP 26 is actually increasing these scheduled validator rewards incentives from now until July 2024 by 70 million. Because I think a while back they had reduced it and now they're trying to kind of get it back up to where it was because they want to make sure to incentivize the proper behavior. And then another 50 million the following year.
00:25:27.112 - 00:25:41.534, Speaker B: Is this part of that original five year plan that Maddok had for when, because Matic was a hard cap token and now Paul's not. But are they going to keep the original five year plan for validator incentives? And then this is the schedule that you're talking about them altering.
00:25:41.682 - 00:26:14.894, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly that. So I think they just want to make sure that they can incentivize enough validators to want to join. But unfortunately that does come at the detriment of token holders through extra dilution. I don't think it's necessarily like the worst thing we just talked about Adam trying to get from 20% to 10% annual inflation. So when we're talking like these numbers on a 10 billion token supply, it's a lot less. So the problems could be bigger. But it's just cool in general to see this migration occur, considering how much of a pioneer polygon was in scaling the EVM.
00:26:14.894 - 00:26:55.246, Speaker A: Like yes, it's a side chain, they get a bunch of crap for how they market it. But I do think had polygon not been there, a lot of other Alt L1s would have picked up a lot more traction back in the last bull run. So I do think polygon is extremely ethereum aligned. And also they just started taking governance a lot more seriously. So they just launched a security council, basically giving them the ability to do emergency upgrades with no time lock, assuming they have ten of 13 signers. And the list of 13 signers is pretty much like some of the top security people in all of web3. So I don't know, I think they're on the right track and I'm excited to see where polygon goes from here, especially once they migrate that side chain over to a validium.
00:26:55.438 - 00:27:58.494, Speaker C: I think there's two things that I want to see. Polygon hasn't had the most thriving defi ecosystem in the grand scheme of things. And I'm not sure if this interoperable aggregator layer will sort of enable novel use cases such as distributed amms, but I think there's a potential chance for them to sort of stand out with cool defi protocols that are only possible on polygon. So I was going to say Solana, just because Solana sort of made that their narrative. And another thing I want to see is obviously the token pool itself is meant to be like a multi utility token, right? You can use it for just to secure the polygon network, you can use it for the sequence of network, the prover network, whatever. I'm really curious as to see how much adoption that gets from day one, or if it's even actually ready, I'm not really sure, but I think that may be indicative for how successful Eigen layer may be, how much people want to use one token as collateral for multiple use cases. It's like a test bid, I guess, for restake.
00:27:58.494 - 00:27:59.134, Speaker C: Deep.
00:27:59.262 - 00:28:49.606, Speaker B: That's pretty interesting, actually. I haven't thought about it from that lens before, but yeah, I like briefly mentioned this, so I want to expand on it. And one of the key differences from the token migration from Matic to poll is the fact that they removed the hard cap so it now can be used as a staking incentive driver sort of into perpetuity. I think there's an inflation cap on it, so it can't just like one year elect to just emit 100% inflation. But they did get rid of the hard cap, which is kind of interesting because it is a one to one token swap, just with some minor tweaks, tokenomics. And honestly, I'm sure that there's some hate out there on them changing some things like this, but they launched that token in what, 2017? I would guess things have changed. There's been a lot of research on what a token should look like, and the team has been building for the last five or so years.
00:28:49.606 - 00:29:20.880, Speaker B: Yeah, I would want them to be able to kind of modify what that token looks like and what it can do and what it can be used for, to kind of build out the most robust ecosystem that they can. And that's ultimately what I believe they're trying to do. So I'm pretty excited about their vision. I'm excited about, honestly, the ZK ecosystems as a whole. I think there's a lot there. I don't know when we'll get it as I think the tech still needs some improvements to really scale. Like, we haven't seen any hyperchains really come into the Zksync ecosystem yet that are know, really blow your socks off by any means.
00:29:20.880 - 00:30:11.098, Speaker B: And even the early campaigns for who polygon is going after to kind of build out on the polygon CDK is kind of in the same boat, right? Like, Kanto is coming over. They were kind of like campaigning to get cello over, which is like a smaller l two, and it's like, all right, those definitely aren't the most attractive change by any means. But what's interesting is because of how the interop layer works. Everybody that's opting into the same interop layer is going to help reduce the cost of proving for each other. And so ultimately, that comes back and benefits the Polygon Zke EVM. So you kind of have this little flywheel effect of like, hey, well, if we're all in this ecosystem, it's cheaper for us. And so it's going to be like this race to see, all right, who can actually get the most attractive set of l two s to kind of come join their network.
00:30:11.098 - 00:30:12.254, Speaker B: So it'll be fun to watch.
00:30:12.372 - 00:30:37.574, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I just add one more thing that I think Polygon is dead if they don't somehow develop some sort of ecosystem fund. You just can't compete with arbitram, optimism, et cetera. Being able to hand out token incentives and bring users over to your chain. I can't get over that point. Even if you look at gains network, that was a Polygon native protocol that migrated over to arbitrum as well. They have two versions live every single day.
00:30:37.574 - 00:30:54.058, Speaker A: It's 85% of volume on arbitrum. They literally just got a stip worth I can't even remember. It's in the five to $10 million range. If you're not getting that on Polygon, why wouldn't you be on arbitrum? You know what I mean? So that's the one other caveat I would disagree.
00:30:54.154 - 00:31:31.574, Speaker D: I think Polygon kind of served as a testament. Don't blow up and just keep going on, and you'll be fine. Being so old and still being in the game and having processed a lot more settlement than something like stellar or like, like those kinds of, like, polygon is still here. Even though Defi appetite is pretty bad right now. It doesn't even have to be defi for Polygon to succeed. I mean, they've got the Starbucks Odyssey thing going on. There's just, like, plenty of other.
00:31:31.574 - 00:31:44.430, Speaker D: I guess they kind of have a brand. Even if crypto native people don't think so, they do have a recognizable brand, and people know they can go to Polygon to try something out in crypto.
00:31:44.930 - 00:32:22.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess another counterpoint there would be the interop layer as a whole, right? Like, if they can get some liquidity moat around the interop layer, then there may be some external drivers for why you'd want to be within this ecosystem, which, yeah, maybe you can go to arbitram, get a stip, get some free money, and get some short term usage. But maybe I need to be in this app with everybody else that has this hub of liquidity around it to really get traction. I don't know. I'm spitballing here, but that's why I'm just really excited about the idea of this interoperable. I think that blocker research needs to do an in depth analysis on that because, a, I want to read it, but b, it'll be really cool.
00:32:23.072 - 00:32:40.990, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. Sandeep as well. Just as another point has tweeted on, like, as a reply to someone else saying, what do you mean we're not going to do an airdrop? Who said think? Who knows if he's just hyping this shit up, but nonetheless, he's aware that he needs to get people farming.
00:32:41.650 - 00:33:08.482, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? As we explore today's blockchain landscape, let's take a moment to recognize Hexons, the premier cybersecurity provider in web3.

Without further ado, let's get back to today's episode.
00:33:29.066 - 00:33:31.806, Speaker B: Time for a little hot seat. Cool throne. What do we say?
00:33:31.908 - 00:33:32.846, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:33:32.948 - 00:33:36.420, Speaker B: All right, pipples, why don't you kick us off?
00:33:37.030 - 00:34:17.470, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll come in with the hot seat. And it's a name that we seldom talk about on here, but it's Polka dot. They have a little over $400 million worth of dot unlocking tomorrow and the 25th. And then I think there's another wave. In January, basically, two years ago, people were locking up dot in the pair of chain auctions, which was, like, the ultimate hype machine, and they locked them for, like, two years. And probably, like, the average cost basis of someone who locked dot back then was around, like, $25. And now it's at, like, $4.
00:34:17.470 - 00:34:49.642, Speaker D: It's kind of been moving the past few days. I think it's like five bill circulating market cap. You've got like 400 ish mil about to unlock. I don't really think there's enough liquidity to handle a mass dump of like 400 mil dot open. Interest is sitting around like 30 mil. So not even 10% of this upcoming unlock. And I'm just expecting a lot of volatility on dot for the next few days.
00:34:49.642 - 00:35:10.734, Speaker D: And so at surface level it's hot seat like, oh no, dot's going to go to zero. But then if you look further, probably the most entertaining outcome is going to be some sort of massive short squeeze where dot rallies like a time NFA, but we'll see. It's going to be really interesting to see what happens with this.
00:35:10.932 - 00:36:10.430, Speaker B: I was scrolling through, just looking at activity on some of these parachains and like, man, the apps deployed over there is no different than the shittiest l two s. It's just like Dex, Dex, Dex lending protocol, nothing else. And I don't know. Yeah, I know there was some contention around, I guess this takes me, I'm totally derailing the conversation now, but when compound was talking about building out in the polkadot ecosystem and it never came to fruition, but they were playing around with the app chain idea, it's like, what if they decide, you know what, screw it, we're going to execute on that anyways. I wonder if that would have changed the game at all. Would there be more people who would have said, oh, compound is doing it, so let's go try to do it and go play with it. And then one of the things that I always see touted about Polkadot is there's so many developers going on, there's so much development activity, so many developers.
00:36:10.430 - 00:36:42.410, Speaker B: So I went over to token terminal and pulled up their core developers chart and sure enough, Polkadot's in the top five. But I've never put a lot of credence into that metric because Cardano is sitting at number one by a wide margin. And you're not going to tell me that there's more development work going on on Cardano than Ethereum main net or Ethereum and its l two s. It's just not true. So I don't know, that's like the number one metric I always see touted for polka dot. It's just like a hard metric for me to get behind. It's just really easy to fake.
00:36:42.410 - 00:36:48.910, Speaker B: And if some dude's just pushing a readme update on the GitHub. That's not development.
00:36:49.730 - 00:37:30.940, Speaker D: Yeah, it's probably really someone just, like, going in there and changing the font size, different code, and they're just, like, doing it multiple times a day. I'd also add that the real nail in the coffin for Polkadot was ever. Was it called the Nomad Bridge whenever that got hacked, moonbeam, moon river, whatever it was called, was like the number one successful parachain and supposed to kind of be like the prodigal child of the entire dot ecosystem. And that bridge hack just killed it, like, completely massacred any chance of polka dot Defi. So it's just been real bad since then.
00:37:31.390 - 00:38:00.838, Speaker A: They also took forever on their, I think they call it XCMP, cross chain messaging protocol. They were, like, building that forever. And I haven't even gotten an update on that, so I'm not sure if that's live, but I feel like that kind of hurt, too, with cosmos having native IBC. But as you were talking pibbles, I did pull up levitas and saw that the funding rate is like negative 33% annualized, and open interest is like doubled over the last 24 hours. So that is kind of an interesting set up. This is going to be one to watch over the coming days for sure.
00:38:01.004 - 00:38:26.880, Speaker C: I think my reaction with all the facts laid out was that, holy crap, how many billions of dollars in dot were locked up for the parachain auctions? And I think my first reaction when I learned about parachain auctions was like, why would you only have one month? You're fundamentally limiting how much your business or your network can make. And it just made zero sense to me when I first learned about Polkadot and the entire architecture. It still doesn't really make sense today.
00:38:27.410 - 00:38:36.100, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the idea behind that was basically, let's try and lock up as much supply as we can for two years, so that way our bags vest when everyone else can't sell.
00:38:36.710 - 00:39:05.002, Speaker B: If I had to guess, hey, supply sinks were hot. I mean, eth burn, baby. Got to get a narrative going for your token. I guess counterpoint to my developer's comment was, let's take that number at face value and assume it to be true. Then that just takes me back to crypto as a whole's problem of distribution matters. And even if you have great tech, you got to get people to use it and you got to be building things that actually are useful. So I don't know.
00:39:05.136 - 00:39:38.150, Speaker C: I'll also add that for active developers count, there's probably like a, I don't know, if this is the correct term. But like a power law distribution, like your top 0.1 developer probably has 1000 times more impact on your ecosystem than the other 99.99% combined. And that's definitely very true in crypto. For example, arbitrum and GMX. Sure, maybe they have like 10,000 developers, but if they didn't have the five developers for GMX, would arbitrum be like anywhere as close to how big they are today? I don't think so.
00:39:38.220 - 00:40:18.094, Speaker B: That's a great point. I think it's even more true for protocols like applications rather than base layers, right? So something like Curve Mitch and Fitty are like what percentage of activity on that GitHub? I'd take them over a team of 100 random devs any day of the week. And most engineers would agree with that. They're like, yeah, I'd rather have one or two, a small team of powerhouse engineers than a large team of average engineers. The small team or the single person will always outcompete the larger group. You introduce inefficiencies and I don't know, if you talk to some engineers, you start to learn that those dudes just like to operate. It's a different brain.
00:40:18.094 - 00:40:21.746, Speaker B: It's a different brain. Sam, who you got in the hot seat or cool throne this week?
00:40:21.928 - 00:40:44.570, Speaker A: I've got scroll main net launch in the cool throne. You probably could have put it in the hot seat as well. It's only got a little bit over 10 million of TbL. I checked out some of the Dapps on DFI llama that are live, and it's once again just a list of ten different dexes. So people are just swapping shit coins on scroll with nothing else to do. They also previously raised at a $1.8 billion valuation.
00:40:44.570 - 00:41:02.362, Speaker A: I don't know, man. I mean, I'm happy that they finally launched everyone. I think their team is legitimate. I think they care about scaling Ethereum. I think they care a lot and deeply about crypto. So very happy for the team. But just right now, between polygon, ZKVM, Zksync and Scroll, they're all lagging.
00:41:02.362 - 00:41:31.306, Speaker A: You can combine the tbl of all of those and they don't even equal base, and that doesn't even have a token. And Zksync and Scroll are obviously going to be farmed. So I don't know, I guess I'm kind of curious to see when ZKe evms actually kind of find their product market fit, niche and start to get in the narrative because everyone was talking about this. For over a year now. They're all alive and no one's using them. I have only bridged over to one of them. Personally, I'm curious if you guys have even bridged to one of them.
00:41:31.408 - 00:41:47.998, Speaker D: I think the sole utility of any sort of like CK EVM is to raise a ton of money so that you can get things like scroll sauce, this hot sauce that's branded as scroll. I think that's ultimate use case.
00:41:48.164 - 00:41:49.840, Speaker A: How did you have that ready?
00:41:50.450 - 00:41:52.270, Speaker C: I keep it on my desk.
00:41:53.410 - 00:41:54.400, Speaker A: That's great.
00:41:55.250 - 00:42:36.078, Speaker B: That's incredible. Okay, so arbitram and optimism are obviously crushing all the ZK roll ups and activity metrics right now, but they got to latch onto some of the bull market growth, right? So they had developers come in like, holy shit, we can build on a cheaper version of Ethereum. That's awesome. Let's get in there and do it. Whereas some of the ZK roll upset launched within the last twelve, anything that launched within the last twelve months, you're not getting any love from any new wave of users or builders. So you kind of like trudging through the dirt. So to me it's not about now, but it's about what will happen in the next twelve to 24 months.
00:42:36.078 - 00:43:20.122, Speaker B: And that's really where I think there is the potential for something more interesting to happen again. Because you create these ecosystems that can benefit off of other chains in a way that base cannot impact, can't be useful. There's no interrupt between base and optimism, I guess is what I'm trying to say. Or arbitrum is really just this one l two that's kind of siloed within its own canister where yes, it can have some l three s that live on top of it, but that's still a bit different. Whereas ZK rollups can have this hyper bridging or this interop layer that just allows for richer communications between l two s that utilize the same smart contract bridge and the same proving circuit. So I'm really excited to kind of see where that direction goes. But there's no sugar coating it.
00:43:20.122 - 00:43:23.454, Speaker B: That's not here today. And we haven't seen any of that usage today.
00:43:23.572 - 00:44:07.322, Speaker C: I want to add a few more things here. First of all, I think that valuation that it previously raised, that is completely ridiculous. It doesn't justify the valuation by any means. Second thing is, I think scroll has done a pretty poor job at BD or just getting their narrative out there. They're just hiring for ahead of growth now. And it kind of feels like it's way too late to be hiring ahead of growth, right? Every other ecosystem has a very prominent researcher or head of growth, head of DFI CEO that everyone just kind of knows on Twitter. If you think about who that is for scroll, it's not that obvious I guess, like Chogu, but he's just debating semantics of people on Twitter for like 365 days a year.
00:44:07.322 - 00:44:21.710, Speaker C: I'm not sure that counts as getting your narrative and being like a spokesperson for the entire ecosystem. So yeah, not an impossible task, but definitely a lot, a lot of work for whoever they hire to fill their head of growth. Row.
00:44:23.410 - 00:44:25.390, Speaker A: Is Ren looking for jobs?
00:44:26.690 - 00:44:31.362, Speaker C: I just saw like Sandy Pung post on Twitter. I don't think I even follow her.
00:44:31.496 - 00:44:32.830, Speaker A: I'm just messing.
00:44:32.990 - 00:44:34.660, Speaker C: I want to take a job though.
00:44:36.070 - 00:44:41.110, Speaker B: Many such cases of great tech and questionable like a question mark on distribution.
00:44:42.410 - 00:45:14.274, Speaker D: I think what's really going to happen over the next twelve months is how all the money flocked from all l ones to all these l two s in private rounds and fundraising. I think the Alt L1s are all going to have their day and see major applications that are successful, that aren't finance related at all. And then once everyone starts flooding back into the all l one trade, then maybe the l two see something. But I'm way more bullish all l ones right now.
00:45:14.392 - 00:45:16.706, Speaker B: Which all l ones, definitely.
00:45:16.888 - 00:45:53.440, Speaker D: Obviously Salana near is really cool, I just published a report about that. But they're doing some really good stuff fixing the distribution problem and they have actual apps that are using it without the actual end users knowing they're doing anything with crypto. I also think Aptos just launched some game that's apparently picking up traction right now. So Aptos activity is up and then Sui is also going to be a really good one. I don't think I'm a fan of SeI, I will say that, but I think there's a lot of upside in all these other ones.
00:45:53.890 - 00:46:11.650, Speaker A: Just curious too. While we're on the topic, how do you think, I guess the alt layer ones from last cycle perform outside of solo. So like Avax. I'm blanking actually right now to think of another, but I don't know. There just seems to be so little going on over there and they're like screaming into the echo chamber and just no one cares.
00:46:12.870 - 00:46:44.650, Speaker D: Well, I think I'm definitely team near because Niercon is coming up soon and you really can't fade the founders of near and how much money they're sitting on. They can do whatever they want. Avalanche, they really tried with stars arena, and then it got exploited like three times. But apparently there's that private defi subnet or whatever that wisdom tree is allegedly using. So maybe they have something niche there.
00:46:44.800 - 00:46:48.558, Speaker A: Fair take. Fair take. All right, Ren, who you got in the hot seat or cool throne this week?
00:46:48.644 - 00:47:12.502, Speaker C: All right, I actually got two. I got one in the hot seat. I'm going to get to the cool throne one later. So I have Celestia in the hot seat. They recently concluded their air job, I think, last Thursday. Pretty shocking numbers, actually, for what is going to be hyped as one of the most exciting infrastructure projects, airdrops. In the past few months, only 32.8%
00:47:12.502 - 00:47:34.710, Speaker C: of people claim their celestial tokens. And I like to clarify that there's like three buckets that they airdropped to. So one are early adopters of roll up. So that's why we like normies like you and me. And they got 2% of the total token supply. Another 2% went to stakers and IBC relayers on Cosmos and osmosis. So they probably all went through and everyone claimed it.
00:47:34.710 - 00:48:13.142, Speaker C: And the last two were basically devs that have been contributing to various ecosystems. If you have a super big GitHub repo, if you're a big modular guy, you probably got part of the 2% allocated. But yeah, 32.8% claim is a pretty shocking number. It's a good thing that they distributed all of the unclaimed tokens to all of those that claim. So people probably got two to three extra initial allocation. But that muted demand, to me, kind of signified two things, right? Either, the first being that crypto still has a lot of us users and none of them managed to bypass sort of like the VPN restriction.
00:48:13.142 - 00:48:49.714, Speaker C: And apparently it was quite a bit harder to do so than bypassing your normal VPN restriction from claiming an airdrop. So I guess that's probably one thing to take note of. The other thing is that maybe there's just not that much excitement for the airdrop, especially considering that I think most people only got like $100 to $200. That doesn't move the mark. And especially if you're just like a. Normally being a dj on l two, you really could not care less about modular blockchains, like modular data availability, execution. You're going to be like, what is this? $200? I'm not going to bother.
00:48:49.714 - 00:49:23.166, Speaker C: Right? So prelaunch futures have it trading at 2 billion. You can trade on AvO. There's probably another perfect exchange that I'm blanking on and its previous raise was at $1 billion in October 2022. My take is that I don't think it justifies that valuation right now. I'm not that excited about marginal blockchains, to be honest, especially with the proliferation of app chains within roll up stacks. I just don't see it yet. Perhaps I'm missing something.
00:49:23.166 - 00:49:25.586, Speaker C: But yeah, that's my takeaway for now.
00:49:25.688 - 00:49:35.620, Speaker D: I'm going to feel so vindicated when Celestia launches and it's like a complete letdown and all the threads over the past two years have all been for nothing.
00:49:36.070 - 00:49:41.480, Speaker B: If you want to know how to get zero x fibbles to hate you, it's write a thread. It's actually that simple.
00:49:42.890 - 00:50:01.866, Speaker A: Hey, I'm the writer of some of those threads, but it's from the blockworks research account, so I feel like I get a pass. No, I agree though here, Ren, I feel like 1 billion seems pretty ridiculous, but I do think that the FDV of the token will be two to 3 billion, best guess? I don't know. What's it trading at on Avo right now, if you happen to recall.
00:50:02.058 - 00:50:10.062, Speaker C: Yeah, so Avo is at $2 billion, double its last raise at 1 billion. Okay.
00:50:10.116 - 00:50:31.318, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely attribute it to just making it super hard to claim for VPN people. And the fact that 33% of people claimed, I bet 20% of that is people who are witty enough to get around the VPN wall through some niche method that people were sharing in telegram chat. So I don't know, kind of depressing that 90% of crypto usage, in my opinion, is probably us users, it's going.
00:50:31.324 - 00:51:31.482, Speaker B: To be really exciting to see if eclipse does really well as an l two on ethereum, using the SVM and using Celestia for DA. Because if they pull that off, and let's just say they absolutely crush it, and for one reason or another that gets attributed to using Celestia for DA, that'll get really interesting, right? Because if you are an l two today and you can cut your cost by 95% by switching from ethereum da to Celestia da, at what point does your dow start pressuring you in to do this? Or at what point does the maybe it's a more centralized chain and maybe at what point does the centralized team start pushing for this? Or do investors start pushing for this? When does it make sense to say, maybe I break some eth alignment and actually go use Celestia for da? So I don't know. It's going to be interesting to see who else gets over there to kind of prove the Celestia use case? But Eclipse has definitely got a very interesting shot at it for sure.
00:51:31.616 - 00:52:13.234, Speaker C: I'll chime in here on Dan's point of pressuring your dower protocol to move over to Celestia for da. So last Friday, Celestia themselves launched this thing called blobstream. I haven't looked into it too much, but it basically allows you to stream your da in like a modular fashion to Ethereum mainnet. I'm just going to read the tweet here. So synclabs also announced Blobstream X. It's a ZK liteclient based implementation of blobstream, which streams Celestia's high throughput, verifiable Da layer to roll ups settled on Ethereum mainet. So it seems like there may be some middle ground.
00:52:13.234 - 00:52:27.142, Speaker C: You may not have to choose either or. And maybe there's the best of both worlds that developers can tap into. But as like a standalone solution just off the top of it's hard to see, again, a huge amount of outsized adoption.
00:52:27.286 - 00:52:53.940, Speaker A: You've also got to get enough people running light nodes, right, because that's the whole scalability model of a DA layer, is that the more light nodes you have, it kind of logarithmically scales. So I don't know, I'm a little bit bearish on the idea of people actually wanting to do that. But the Celestia team like Nick White, have been doing a really good job marketing it, at the very least taking all the pictures of running a light node on random places on random devices, like a Game Boy or something, which has been cool.
00:52:55.030 - 00:53:20.198, Speaker C: Yeah. All right. For the cool drone this week, I have Circle. I feel like Circle has been launching a lot of cool, exciting stuff. Just last month they launched like Circle Research and they launched their perimeter protocol, which is sort of their real world asset protocol securitization, blah, blah, blah. But last week they launched Circle gas station. So this is basically Circle's really strong move into account abstraction.
00:53:20.198 - 00:54:13.694, Speaker C: What it is, is that Circle has a gas station that handles sourcing and transferring gas tokens so developers can focus on building their apps, right? Basically, a developer can define gas policies, manage sponsorship rules, the number of transactions that they want to sponsor. And Circle will basically pay for you. So whatever users pay, Circle will pay for you through the account abstraction and like a paymaster contract. But interestingly, Circle is charging a 5% convenience fee under that, and it's billed at the end of the month. You don't need to stream it on a per transaction basis, which I thought was a very interesting model. And yeah, Circle also recently launched program of our wallets, I think probably three or four months ago. So I'm not sure how much adoption wallet as a service has gotten, but I think account abstraction has definitely gotten a lot more adoption than people think.
00:54:13.694 - 00:55:18.722, Speaker C: If you go check out some dune dashboards like Paymaster contracts actually have a surprising amount of activity ever since ERC four, three, seven launched. And so I think circles one is really exciting, one outlier sort of way that I think I see this contributing a lot to circles like top line is if USDC obviously is like a multi chain token, especially with CCTP, chances are you're going to be using USDC on multiple blockchains. And so in the future, if you launch a wallet and you want to sort of give your users the options to transfer USDC to multiple chains to CCTP, can circle basically use the gas station for that and charge an extra 5% on that? Right. And so 5% of gas fees may not seem like much, but I would bet over time, especially if stuff such as SAP. SAP, like using USCC, that kind of stuff really takes off. And if you're like an institutional logistics client, right, you're not going to be wanting to use USCC in a wallet. You want all of that abstracted away.
00:55:18.722 - 00:55:25.438, Speaker C: Like 5% on all of those transfer and gas fees could probably make a lot of money for circle in the long term.
00:55:25.614 - 00:55:51.440, Speaker A: Just imagine being SAP, though, and getting your monthly bill saying they integrated this this month, and you're like, okay, nice. It's only like a few thousand dollars, and then in the middle of a bull run, it's like 30 grand. And they're like, what the hell is going on here? I don't know. This seems like more of a headline, in my opinion, and something that won't get that much traction, to be completely honest. But hopefully I'm wrong, because I definitely commend circle for trying their best to make the UX a little bit better.
00:55:51.890 - 00:56:16.946, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm all for abstracting away crypto from crypto apps. I think that's definitely net bullish. And it's interesting though, this is running on Polygon, actually, which is. I don't know, I found that pretty interesting. I wonder if they're going to keep it there or move it somewhere else once it rolls into a validium. I don't know. Circle does an interesting job of building out developments across many different chains, which I find quite interesting.
00:56:16.946 - 00:56:23.430, Speaker B: They're not just like all in on building on eth main net or one L two or Salana. They're kind of a little bit of everywhere.
00:56:24.570 - 00:56:53.706, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll add on to that. Circle recently announced CTP on Salana Testnet, so it seems like that's coming live soon. I think CCTP is also coming to noble really soon. So Circle is definitely leaning in very heavily into a multi chain future and supporting developers, so to say. With that, I think the 5% convenience fee ties pretty well into a uniswap interface fee. So I'm going to pass it over to you, Dan.
00:56:53.818 - 00:57:29.370, Speaker B: I was just getting ready to use the same segue there. That's beautiful, but yeah, egregious. How dare circle charge 5% for their interface? No, I'm kidding. I've got Uniswap labs on the hot seat this week for the community's reaction to their interface fee. So quick TLDR and some statistics around this. There's a zero point 15% fee on all swaps that go through the official interfaces. That's going to be Uniswap X, the Uniswap front end that you'd go to the traditional front end that you're used to using, and I believe the mobile app as well.
00:57:29.370 - 00:58:06.034, Speaker B: And so in about six ish days, they've done two hundred and eighty k in fees, which annualizes to roughly about $15 million of total fee revenue. And that's in the middle of a bear market, folks. So you could easily see double that once things start heating up and there's more transaction activity that's really just happening on chain. And people were really fired up about this. Hey, you're charging your users for the benefit of Uniswap labs. And none of this goes back to token holders. But the reality is the person that is using a Uniswap front end is provably price insensitive.
00:58:06.034 - 00:58:43.458, Speaker B: They do not care the price that they're getting on their execution, because if they did care, they would not be using the Uniswap front end. You'd be using an aggregator. And it's important to note that the fee only applies to a certain subset of tokens, right? So this is going to be like a couple of stablecoins and ETH and wrapped ETH and wrapping. From ETH to wrapped ETH doesn't cost anything, or stablecoin to stablecoin swaps doesn't cost anything. So the large driver here is definitely the ETH and USDC pair. And if you're going to swap ETH, USDC, and you're hitting the Uniswap front end. You literally do not care the price you're going to get.
00:58:43.458 - 00:59:26.746, Speaker B: If you're paying an extra point 15%, you don't even know it. You never even cared. And so where that activity is kind of coming from, because it's across all chains where Uniswap front ends are deployed, 230 of the from Ethereum, and then another 35 of that is from arbitrum. And some of the other l two s kind of are quite small, actually, in comparison to those two. And so the Uniswap universal router, which is what the front end will hit, is the vast majority of this volume, with Uniswap X coming in second. And there's an interesting case for the single largest fee a user paid was $4,000, a little over $4,000 on what was a $2.7 million swap from ETH to USDT.
00:59:26.746 - 01:00:05.902, Speaker B: And I think that is absolutely wild that somebody was making this transaction and just pulled up the Uniswap front end with $2.7 million of ETH and was like, boom, I'm going to make this swap. So they ended up paying an extra $4,000 in fees and they got sandwiched. So absolutely brutal. If you're moving that kind of size, a, you need to be using an aggregator, and b, you need to be using something that will protect you from MeV, like a flashbots endpoint. So, another thing to think about there, but the large uproar was really centered around the fact that most people felt that there was a huge chasm between Uniswap Labs equity holders, and then uni token holders. And that's definitely true.
01:00:05.902 - 01:00:50.870, Speaker B: The incentives aren't aligned one to one, but I don't think that they're as far off as people really make them seem. And they make labs out to be this really ill intentioned group that is really only extracting value from Uni token holders and giving it to equity holders. That said, there is no doubt that the Uniswap Labs team has a duty to their shareholders to maximize the shareholder value. That's what they need to do. However, I think Uniswap the protocol plays a very pivotal role in achieving that goal that Uniswap Labs has. And sure, they could be successful if Uniswap protocol died tomorrow, but their likelihood of being successful probably drops by about 97%. And so, because of that, yes, I do think that they need to create the best protocol that can ultimately return value to token holders.
01:00:50.870 - 01:01:57.842, Speaker B: I just don't think that's today, because the debate is like, the community has been talking about turning on the Uniswap protocol level fee switch forever, but all that does is take revenue away from lps who are already getting kicked in the teeth. Like, lping is a wildly negative EV experience for a vast majority of users, and a lot of this liquidity comes from, what, 1015 different lps? I promise you that Uniswap Labs is talking to these lps, and those lps don't want to give up their fees. So do you really want to go piss off the seven to ten people that are supplying liquidity to your protocol? And if you do and they leave, then you don't have a protocol anymore, so you don't have future fee revenue to get. And there's been some good studies done around hypothesizing how you'd go about turning on the fee switch and which pools you would use and which chains you'd start on, and really kind of testing the waters, but that's all you're doing is testing the waters. It doesn't make sense to me at all to say, hey, we know LP, you're going to lose 5% while you do this. But us, the Dow, we want to get a couple more percent out of you, and we actually want to turn on our own fee switch. So instead of losing 5%, now you're going to lose 9%.
01:01:57.842 - 01:02:57.614, Speaker B: That doesn't make any sense. So if you want to be returning fee revenue to your token, there needs to be excess cash to distribute, because even if you diverted this 15 or so million dollar front end fee switch to the token holders instead of the Uniswap labs team, that equate to a roughly half percent dividend rate, basically. So what's more valuable to the protocol itself, a half percent dividend or reinvesting in labs who is incentivized to make the best protocol possible? And to me, it's very clear that you should be reinvesting in the developers rather than kind of like building towards future growth. And there's a lot of things that future growth can look like. It can be enhancing an existing product, or building a new service line, or funding more research into LP profitability, for example, literally anything. And so to me it's very clear, but the rest of the community does not feel this way. It's kind of a controversial take to say you should reinvest in growth rather than distribute to the token holders.
01:02:57.614 - 01:03:27.742, Speaker B: So, I mean, yes, I see the chasm here. And I see why people are upset that there's this difference. Uniswap labs not really maximally aligned with the token holders because of the equity. And I see how that's like a fundamentally flawed model. But I don't think it's like the be all, end all. And it's like, oh, well, Uniswap is done. They could go build some ancillary product that's funded by this $15 billion of revenue from the interface fee switch that feeds more value to the Uniswap protocol, and then that's how the fee switch gets turned on.
01:03:27.742 - 01:03:37.634, Speaker B: That's a very probable outcome. And everybody seems kind of like blind to that acknowledgement. So I don't know, rant over, but I just don't think it's the end of the world that people are making it out to be.
01:03:37.832 - 01:04:07.578, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely agree. I mean, if you think about before the interface fee switch, to date, Unisoft Labs has literally made like $0. A company needs to make money eventually. You can't just fund it with vc funding and not make any revenue into perpetuity. It just doesn't work. So I don't really blame Unisoft for turning on their interface usage. And I think making it just for Unisoft front ends is like a very fair way for them to do so.
01:04:07.578 - 01:06:07.374, Speaker C: And I also agree with everything you said about sort of like reinvesting protocol profits, right? Even if you think Unisoft has won the dex competition, even if you think DYDX has dominated the purpose market, right? Even if you think Ethereum is the best blockchain on planet Earth, the truth is, with the current users on chain today, no one has won yet. The market can very drastically change in the next two 3510 years, right? You should be building up that war chest and deploying it in order to think of new product lines, increase your mode, whether that's like liquidity mode or like a branding mode, sort of differentiate your product better and just build an overall more valuable product, you shouldn't be giving that out to sort of governance token holders. And I think that's another thing, right? I think a lot of people know that governance tokens are meant to be just governance tokens, but they always see it as equity, and so they always price and value it as equity and also expect things that equity and securities get, eg, like dividends. But if you think about governance tokens, they're literally meant to be governance tokens, right? If it's truly a governance token, should uniswap be trading at like a $3 billion valuation? Probably not, to be honest, if it truly can only be used to vote on snapshot votes. And yeah, I think my final point is that I do have some gripes with a token plus equity duo structure, just because for the same revenue generated, you kind of disperse it to both parties, it can only be either or. And I think that definitely is a problem for sort of like incentive alignment and value accrual. Probably the best case outcome of this whole token plus equity dual structure debate is that in ten years we get tokens that are essentially programmable equity, they get officially listed as securities, and they're well regulated and whatnot.
01:06:07.374 - 01:06:19.800, Speaker C: I think that's the best case outcome, because with token plus equity dual structures, there's always going to be this debate about value accrual and incentive alignment, and it's just like a fundamental fact of nature that you cannot change.
01:06:20.330 - 01:07:29.398, Speaker B: Yeah, I like that you brought up the point about tokenomic design here, because the irony is curve has returned about somewhere between 100 and $120,000,000 of revenue to the token. And it can do this because the token plays a very important role within the ecosystem, and it uses ve tokenomics, it needs locks. So to incentivize locks, it distributes these dividend returns to the lockers. And that's why it can afford to do this. And it's not just like wasting money. The token plays a very dedicated role within the ecosystem, which is in complete contrast to a pure governance token. So I appreciate that you brought that up, because that's the ultimate point here, is if you want dividends at a very early stage protocol, the token must play a role within the ecosystem, or else you're definitely better off reinvesting that capital and growth because you'reinvesting in the most high growth industry that there is what I believe to be the most high growth industry in crypto.
01:07:29.398 - 01:07:46.350, Speaker B: And so, yes, you have to beat the cost of capital in order to reinvest that instead of distribute it. And I very much so believe that you can achieve that within crypto, and that's just a better outcome than distributing revenue to token holders.
01:07:47.490 - 01:08:16.886, Speaker A: Yeah, last thought on this point, too. I just see a lot of bad takes on Twitter right now, comparing the uniswap people going, oh well, look at what Duidx is doing. It's like they raked in like 100 million plus in fees over the last few years from v three, and they pretty much have enough capital to last for six and a half years into the future. So Uniswap didn't have that luxury. As you mentioned, Dan and Ren, they had to actually pay out lps. Couldn't hurt them by turning on a fee switch, so it accrued to uniswap Labs. So I think it's just a very apples and oranges comparison.
01:08:16.886 - 01:08:21.180, Speaker A: And you really can't even draw parallels between the way the two are kind of going forward.
01:08:22.030 - 01:08:52.054, Speaker C: Yeah, if I had to make like a web two comparison, where Uniswap is today is probably like Uber. In the first few years, they're probably dominating half of the US cities. And then imagine if Travis Kalanick went to Bill Gerdy and said, all right, we're in a good spot. I'm going to start sort of like giving out profits to equity holders. And then the next five years they get completely dafted in the asian markets in every single Asia market that they try to expand and dominate in. It would just make zero sense.
01:08:52.172 - 01:09:00.900, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree, Ren, but that's probably a good place to leave it. So thank you all for tuning into this week's episode pibbles. Ren, thanks for hopping on. It was a pleasure to have you, and we'll see you next week.
