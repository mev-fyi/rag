00:00:01.080 - 00:00:35.085, Speaker A: Yeah, I think memes are increasingly fair play. Spending my time at more and more crypto conferences, I'm actually understanding, like, how many people hate this asset class. But in actuality, like, the longer they trade, the more of a historical time series they have, the more palatable they are to quantitative traders and hedge funds, the more palatable they are to TA traders who look at support and resistance and things like that. Like. And those norms compound until they are like actual risk management tools to some degree.
00:00:37.905 - 00:00:54.903, Speaker B: Nothing said on Zero X Research is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is for informational purposes only and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our opinions, not financial advice. Boccaccio Ryan and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects as discussed.
00:00:55.039 - 00:00:56.315, Speaker C: Owns any of them?
00:00:57.935 - 00:00:59.431, Speaker B: Surely he owns a bit of some.
00:00:59.503 - 00:01:04.287, Speaker A: I. I own. I own jito. But.
00:01:04.391 - 00:01:08.471, Speaker C: But Block Works financial disclosures form real quick.
00:01:08.623 - 00:01:38.973, Speaker B: Also, if you're in Block Works, you have to own half of whatever Solana tokens there are or else you go to jail. It's gonna be nice. All right, we are doing. What are we talking about? Eigenlayer token launch, PI, USD Synthetics referendum. Is the topic. Notes that I have Anything else or can we get started? I think it's good.
00:01:39.069 - 00:01:40.093, Speaker C: I think it's good.
00:01:40.269 - 00:01:44.945, Speaker B: Ryan, Connor, Anything that you specifically want to touch upon?
00:01:49.095 - 00:01:51.559, Speaker A: Did I. I added something or. No, I didn't.
00:01:51.607 - 00:01:52.623, Speaker B: I think we're good.
00:01:52.799 - 00:01:53.555, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:54.495 - 00:02:16.443, Speaker B: I will have to say if we don't mute ourselves, and I'm saying this to everybody, not just a particular person. If we don't mute ourselves, Stefan gets quite upset. So just out in. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
00:02:16.539 - 00:02:17.295, Speaker C: Brian.
00:02:17.875 - 00:02:18.735, Speaker B: Yep.
00:02:19.075 - 00:02:22.531, Speaker A: Just mute myself only when I'm not talking.
00:02:22.723 - 00:02:27.707, Speaker C: Yeah. Or the kids daycare is going to be out.
00:02:27.771 - 00:02:29.935, Speaker A: He just doesn't want to hear about me at all.
00:02:30.435 - 00:02:35.415, Speaker B: No, we. We definitely do forget how to do these.
00:02:36.805 - 00:02:39.625, Speaker C: No, it's always background New York noises.
00:02:40.645 - 00:02:41.745, Speaker A: That's my bad.
00:02:42.205 - 00:03:01.653, Speaker B: What's up, guys? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. I haven't been with Ryan. We gotta mute Bud. There we go. I haven't been with you guys in nearly two months now, so it's very good to be back. I missed everything that is happening in the markets. So I'm going to call upon Mr.
00:03:01.653 - 00:03:08.245, Speaker B: Danny to tell me what has been going up, what has been going down and why this time is different.
00:03:11.105 - 00:03:52.221, Speaker C: Why this time is different. That's fun. As far as the markets in recent weeks, I think you know, bitcoin and the General markets have seen some strength again. So obviously everyone, everyone in this space, their, their risk appetite has kind of come back in full force very quickly. You missed out on some hippos, some animals going crazy on the Solana blockchain. So I think we've just seen a very drastic change in sentiment from a month ago where it was doom and gloom everywhere and now we get some green candles on bitcoin and now everyone is very excited to ape into their favorite alts and memes again very quickly.
00:03:52.373 - 00:04:20.105, Speaker B: It's kind of crazy how quickly it shifts. Feel like it wasn't this like memes have clearly become. It used to be maybe like, let's say bitcoin goes up, solana goes up, or like ethereum goes up, solana goes up. And then you'd get like alt L1s and in the end it would be cosmos and then everything would nuke. Now it feels like bitcoin goes up. Ethereum does not go up, Solana goes up. And then every single meme that has ever existed goes up.
00:04:20.105 - 00:04:59.775, Speaker B: And now we're getting old memes going up as well. Mr. Must Stop Murad has a 10 meme list that he's been flaunting around. I feel like that's definitely not going to end up very well. But I mean, at least it's just so difficult to talk about people like, who are doing that because on the one hand I don't want to be like the boomer who's like, oh, meme coins earn great, but, but also like there has to be a limit to how much you can talk. I think Murads is fine, but I've seen other people catching flack. I don't want to name any names, but for shilling, like actually really, really low market cap stuff.
00:04:59.775 - 00:05:11.695, Speaker B: Curious how I guess, like, I don't know what you guys thoughts are on that. It's like, do you think that's fair play? And I know it's not like block works research, but what do you think? How do you approach that?
00:05:12.285 - 00:05:47.267, Speaker A: Yeah, I think memes are increasingly fair play. I don't, I, I can't say low cap memes are because such small amounts can really move meme coins. But. Or sorry, low cap meme coins. But yeah. So the thing about markets is that the longer they trade, like the more quantitative data you have, the more like, like trader myths you have, the more norms are established within markets. So memes are really cementing themselves as like these high beta plays.
00:05:47.267 - 00:07:12.993, Speaker A: If you want to get back into the market and like get Some juice, really quick, kind of like call options on some upside. So, you know, for all the folks that are really, like, fading the meme coin trend, and I'm incredibly, like, now that I'm like, spending my time at more and more crypto conferences, I'm actually understanding, like, how many people hate this asset class. But in actuality, like, the longer they trade, the more of a historical time series they have, the more palatable they are to quantitative traders and hedge funds, the more palatable they are to TA traders who look at support and resistance and things like that, like, and that, that, that those norms compound until they are like actual risk management tools to some degree. Now, I'm not saying that, like, they're going to be in model portfolios or they're going to be a large part of like, hedge fund strategies, but, like, just look at someone like Joe McCann, like, he decided to participate in meme coins, I assume through his fund more than just personally. But certainly he, he's been loud about it on Twitter and other funds are going to see that and they're competing with him for capital and they, they want, you know, LP capital just as much as he does. So there's a lot of, look, people want to say it's illegitimate. Every day that the volumes increase, it becomes less and less illegitimate.
00:07:12.993 - 00:07:38.445, Speaker A: And yes, these volumes are going to plummet 90% at some point in time, but the market volumes generally are also going to plummet 50 to 70%. So that's going to be beta. And these things are going to live on and who knows how big of a part of the market trading they'll be. But I think, I think the evidence suggests that it's more likely that the meme coin stuff is here to stay than it's, you know, then it's ephemeral.
00:07:38.745 - 00:08:06.021, Speaker B: Yeah. I have two things on this. One is that I know anecdotally that funds are actually doing meme coin trades now. And I feel like that wasn't really a thing that I was hearing about a few months back. I'm sure there were others, but now it at least seems like they're more comfortable talking about it. The second thing is, I feel like with memes, it's. They've always been a thing, but this cycle they've just really obviously become like, very, very clearly beta and like very.
00:08:06.021 - 00:08:43.695, Speaker B: How do I put this? They've become more normalized, which I think is fine. And that point you said about, like, if you're late to the market, you can just enter. At this point, I feel like it's become obviously I'm not a great trader, but not obviously people don't know that, but I found that it's actually been relatively not that difficult to just play again. Few months at least. During the Bear, it was like a lot more difficult to pick memes. Even like six, eight months back. I mean there were periods on Solana where you could just chuck like it was like every entry is forgiven and you can just make money.
00:08:43.695 - 00:09:12.765, Speaker B: Before the conflict between Iran and Israel, it was like the very recent one, it was like that again where it was like you could just play around and somehow your entry would be forgiven and you would be blessed. I actually have something that I want to talk about, but Danny, I know you have a lot of thoughts, but I want to bring up PvP trade after this as well because it's something that is actually really. And I tried to get Ryan on it. Not when I get on it, but I think it's something that we got to talk about as well.
00:09:13.665 - 00:10:17.987, Speaker C: Yeah, I just, I want to add one thought here. I saw some discussion, I mean there's always discussion about memes hating him, loving them. I saw totally weigh in as well. And he kind of had this opinion that, you know, as you're, as we're seeing sort of like the tech centered tokens and plays become more rooted to like actual values and cash flows and what they can generate as businesses. In his mind it's like becoming a bit more of like this dichotomy of, you know, you can see these like businesses essentially or you know, tech and utility focused. Like, you know, assets or protocols kind of become tied to like what they actually provide in value. Whereas memes can like live on and continue to grow as like these just pure speculative plays versus in the past it was like, you know, if you're buying ETH or whatever the asset is, it's like you're paying some absurd markup on like virtually zero cash flow to the token and you're hoping that like the memetic power will fuel it to some valuation that you like.
00:10:18.171 - 00:11:15.907, Speaker B: One thing I will say is if memes are outperforming and they are very clearly outperforming all other classes within crypto, how can you justify, like if you're a fund analyst and you've underperformed this entire cycle because you were mainly an ETH defi or like even Solana defi hasn't done particularly well compared to memes, how do you even justify that? Like, because I think that's the main issue that A lot of people have is that they. The same with builders. So they're building these protocols that are very clearly like focused on moving the space forward and they don't get any love. And then it's the same with the fund guy who's doing all the cash flow analysis, who's actually like talking to teams, reading white papers, doing whatever he has to do to like a little bit of alpha. And then in the end, either some random token launches on pump fun and it makes a lot of people a lot of money, or it's like very cabal. I don't like the word cabal, but like, obviously meme coins are an insiders game. Like nobody, like everybody knows this.
00:11:15.907 - 00:11:31.141, Speaker B: And it's the same with most infrastructure tokens as well. So how do you justify that as a fund analyst and be like, you know what, I'm underperforming just because I can't pick the right tokens. You're shaking your head.
00:11:31.213 - 00:11:35.585, Speaker A: They're not, they're not under. They're not underperforming because their benchmark does not include meme coins.
00:11:35.885 - 00:11:36.661, Speaker B: That's fair.
00:11:36.773 - 00:11:39.945, Speaker A: Yeah. So the premise, reject the premise.
00:11:40.685 - 00:11:43.345, Speaker C: Except for the biggest meme, which is bitcoin.
00:11:47.885 - 00:11:52.013, Speaker B: How about this? You're. I don't know how often you have to go back to your office, but you have to.
00:11:52.109 - 00:12:20.951, Speaker A: There's fomo, right? Like that analyst can participate and there is personal fomo. But from a fund perspective, like these guys, these many, many funds are barred from it. Many funds, like they benchmark against Bitcoin, the Bitwise 10, some mixture of Bitcoin and ETH. So actually they're quite happy about ETH going down because they probably own something with a higher beta than eth. Oh, maybe not. Maybe that they own. Maybe they own a lot of ETH beta and they're down too.
00:12:20.951 - 00:12:40.857, Speaker A: I don't know. But yeah, so I don't think, I don't think a lot of funds are seeing like there's not like direct FOMO versus their mandate for certain, but there is FOMO like versus other funds that are outperforming them because they're allowed to participate in bonk and like trade bonk, but versus their benchmark. It's a different story.
00:12:41.001 - 00:13:07.817, Speaker B: Yeah, but I guess I didn't mean like versus your benchmark, but I meant like your lps. You have to go back to them in a few years and say, hey guys, we made, I don't know, 60. But like you can see these people who traded in house money and they made 800 just because they bought popcat Morgan Bonk at the right times. But you don't think that matters. You don't think anybody will be upset because they can't be.
00:13:07.841 - 00:13:34.595, Speaker C: Like, I think they have this. They're coming from the same viewpoint, right? Like, those. Those same LPs are probably like, you know, if you had bet the house on Bonk and it had gone like, you know, the backlash in the other direction would have been so much worse. Right? I mean, obviously it might depend on what. What your fund really looks like and who your LPs are. Maybe you have a degenerate fund, I guess. But I would imagine that, like, the benchmarks that these people are used to and like, the.
00:13:34.595 - 00:13:51.959, Speaker C: The things that they're. They would be comfortable, you know, putting large amounts of capital in. Maybe at this point in time, you know, maybe in a few years, if. If memes are 50 of the top 100 coins, that story might be different, but it is still, like, a relatively small part of the market. It's not quite so normalized yet.
00:13:52.127 - 00:14:17.293, Speaker B: Yeah, it will be. I think we'll see. One other token that has been doing really well is sui. And I still cannot find good SUI ecosystem tokens. Do you guys know any pro? Like, I know Aftermath is supposed to be the next keto. That's what we're all saying. We've all convinced ourselves that Aftermath is going to be the next hero and the airdrop is going to save everybody's lives.
00:14:17.293 - 00:14:55.083, Speaker B: But I feel like when we talk about SWI and Aptos, we mostly say, oh, like, what's the marginal benefit that you get off another L1? But I want to kind of talk more about how do you see these guys actually build out an ecosystem and compete? Not in the sense of, like, what are. Like, is the tech better, is the language better? But more so, like, what approach do these guys need to take such that, for example, if you go on Aptos and you go on Econia, they. We. We just sent around this protocol icon, a protocol you can. Last time I checked, on Econia, you could trade four assets. That's just not good enough. As, like, Solana 2020.
00:14:55.083 - 00:15:16.265, Speaker B: Not even Solana always had semi. You could do stuff. But on some of these chains that are funded crazily, Sui was giving out $200 million last year just for incentives. And they had, like, free protocols where you can swap between four assets. Like, how the. How do you approach that? What do you guys think is, like, the change that they need to do?
00:15:17.725 - 00:15:53.285, Speaker C: Get more assets on chain? I mean, I think if you look at Seoul a year ago, year and a half ago, it's like it was the same. They kind of had the same problem. At that time. There were lots of teams that were actively building, but there were very few tokens on the chain to trade other than just like Sole, maybe Bonk and maybe if a few DEFI projects from the prior cycles that had already released their tokens. This feels very similar. These ecosystems are brand new, so there are some things that are out, but it's very limited in scope at this point in time.
00:15:53.865 - 00:16:17.483, Speaker B: Are they brand new, though? It's been two years now? And also, God bless the broken souls that bought the original Solana tokens that just underperformed Solana. I feel like that was like 20, 21. They at least had tokens. They went down and it was all by the same guy who like developed 13 protocols or something. But at least there was stuff to buy and lose money on. On sui, you can't even lose money because there's nothing to buy.
00:16:17.659 - 00:17:17.937, Speaker A: I'm becoming increasingly convinced that everything going forward is all business development from the foundations and labs or whoever is trying to make ecosystems happen. But like, more specifically it's like. And I think, Danny, you're right, but more specifically it's like getting qualified or legitimate asset issuers to put their token on the chain. Ethan Salana have this to a lesser degree. BAS and Arbitrum have this where there are like legitimate projects who decided to launch their token natively on those chains. When you, when you think about what other ecosystems have done over the last, say six years to get to jumpstart those ecosystems, I think of something like, like some ecosystems have done seemingly everything right and results have been mixed to subpar. If you think of like.
00:17:18.121 - 00:17:21.965, Speaker B: Can you give an example? I just want to think of it with examples as well.
00:17:22.885 - 00:18:23.425, Speaker A: Yeah, I can think of like, look at like Polygon for example, with like every meaningful enterprise partnership you could think of. Like everyone was so jazzed on Polygon 24 months ago because they were crushing it on the BD front. But none of them were like asset issuers issuing tokens, like in a crude way to describe it, like tokens that people want to trade that they have confidence in, but like in like high contrast, like Solana focused on like they got geodnet to bridge their token over and like people want to trade that token pith and wormhole issued there. All these depin projects are issuing on Solana. You look at the Ethereum ecosystem where like, you can argue about the, like, the validity The. The varying degrees of validity of these projects. But, like, every single LST issuer, like, is getting, like, meaningful, like, press, and they're issuing on ETH or whatever.
00:18:23.425 - 00:18:43.965, Speaker A: So I think it's all a BD game. And that's really hard as an analyst to figure out. Like, you have to have a boots on the ground approach. You got to get out of your spreadsheet and, like, talk to folks to figure out which of these changes is doing BD the best. So it's a different ball game.
00:18:44.465 - 00:19:02.835, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's also. They kind of affect each other a lot. Like, the more volume you get, the more people want to come on your chain because they want their tokens to trade volume. They want their tokens to get attention. So it's the same as, like, that's one of the. I don't want to talk too much about Soul Leaf, but that's one of the only things that actually worries me about Soul Leaf.
00:19:02.835 - 00:19:40.945, Speaker B: Like, I am relatively confident in Ethereum, just because we've been having these chatters with Max Resnick and everybody else saying, you know, like, I feel like for something to die, I'm young, so I don't know how corporations die, but in my mind, for something to die, I feel like it needs to go the wrong way, and then nobody cares. Like, nobody actually tries to affect change. And I feel like with ETH, we've been seeing a few EIPs that are. One is to reduce block times. Recently I saw. And one was to improve gas, improve block size. And so that very clearly signals to me that people.
00:19:40.945 - 00:20:08.841, Speaker B: People are actually care about Ethereum and they want to, like, they see that there's some erroneous ways and they want to fix it. My only worry is that. And Ryan, this is something you brought up is that as a chain, you want people to issue assets on your chain. Like, you want tokens to launch on your chain. And on Ethereum, it's just not, like, the last thing that I can think of that Ethereum beat Solana in is Nero, which I don't know if you guys remember. It's like the. And that.
00:20:08.841 - 00:20:30.765, Speaker B: I don't even think that was, like, natural. It was, like, very much affected by Cabal dynamics and, like, insiders. So I can't remember the last time that somebody, like, went ahead. Not last time, but I feel like most tokens are launching on Solana now, which is the only thing that concerns me about Ethereum. It's not like the tech side, because I think they realize their ways and they're going to fix it.
00:20:31.505 - 00:21:02.971, Speaker C: Same with everything else in Ethereum land. The tokens that Launch in the EVM are on the L2s. Like you launch your liquidity on Arbitrum or Base or you know, pick your favorite L2. They don't launch on Mainnet because it's not economical to do so for individuals to claim, pay the gas, swap, et cetera. So it's just the same problem as everything else. The activity is moving there, the tokens are moving over there, and then they're getting, you know, fragmented more because it's like you got to pick which L2 or which L2s plural to start, jump start your liquidity on.
00:21:03.163 - 00:21:43.145, Speaker A: Yeah, if you, if you're an asset issuance issuer, you're very confused about what's going on on eth. Like do they want to accelerate this thing? Are they bringing Defi back on chain the bankless guys really want? Like they just tweeted out maybe two weeks ago, like Defi should live on the Ethel one. Vitalik said the opposite. He's like, I wish that there was no Defi on the Ethel one. So you're very confused. That confusion needs to be cleared up for the market and these protocols to kind of get to figure out the direction of, of ETH and to see whether or not it makes sense to issue assets out. There's a ton of liquidity there.
00:21:43.145 - 00:21:48.745, Speaker A: They just need to tell the market everything's going to be okay and unleash that and unleash that liquidity.
00:21:48.865 - 00:21:55.335, Speaker B: Hey guys, what's up? I'm joined by Miguel, the co founder and chief scientific officer at Nilion. Thanks for coming on, Miguel.
00:21:55.715 - 00:21:56.695, Speaker D: You're welcome.
00:21:59.035 - 00:22:04.655, Speaker B: So what is blind compute and why is it important for crypto and AI?
00:22:05.235 - 00:22:53.067, Speaker D: Well, you know, you can, we can encrypt data at rest and in transfer, but when we want to process it, you have to decrypt it first. Usually that's what happens in Web2 and that's the mother of all problems because then it means that the company running that service has to have access to your data. So blind computation solves for that problem. And it's a process where data is computed without revealing the actual data or the nodes to the nodes performing the computation. So it actually is able to compute while your data remains protected or encrypted. And I guess, well, it's important for crypto is because without privacy enhancing technologies, crypto makes everything public, right? So it's a problem for AI where all information is very sensitive. Think about the user prompts the model weights and the training data sets.
00:22:53.067 - 00:23:04.699, Speaker D: So privacy or blind compute, is actually the ingredient that is missing in the crypto AI mixture if you really want to make it secure, perfect.
00:23:04.867 - 00:23:10.895, Speaker B: And how do you see privacy technologies keeping up with increasing complexity in AI?
00:23:11.315 - 00:23:55.185, Speaker D: That's a very good question. So privacy does add some complexity and slows things down, just like decentralization. But we're seeing some, you know, some important changes in the market. Like for example, models are becoming smaller. So you have all the llama series of models that are very performant and they're typically smaller than the equivalent. You have agentic flows. So agents are very interesting because they provide they benchmark in the same rank more or less with simpler models, just because they're following these patterns where the model just questions about the result and looks at it from different angles.
00:23:55.185 - 00:24:46.037, Speaker D: That's also a very interesting avenue. Then there's also this interesting avenue of binary and trinary networks where the model weights are just represented with bits or with three values. And that makes it easier then and more efficient to be implemented on top of a privacy preserving layer. Plus, we think that AI is evolving towards more independence. You can think of it right now as an AI would be like a soldier and you give it very low level orders, but as it increases in intelligence, it will move towards a relationship with a general. So you just give some general high pattern command and then the general goes off and does its own thing. So that will place less stringent requirements on timing for the underlying crypto.
00:24:46.037 - 00:24:55.705, Speaker D: And at the same time that's when it becomes more sensitive because the information you typically share with a general is way more sensitive than the one you exchange with a soldier.
00:24:56.525 - 00:25:04.355, Speaker B: That makes sense. And how is Nilion specifically approaching Blind Compute and how will it adapt to increasing AI complexity?
00:25:05.055 - 00:26:01.303, Speaker D: So Blind Compute, we're building what we call the orchestration layer. The main idea is that there is no silver bullet in the privacy preserving. In the privacy enhancing technologies world. There's different cryptographic protocols like ZKP and FHE and MPC and even hardware based cryptographic solutions like Tesla. We're not prescriptive as to which solution is the best because we really think they're different tools in a toolset and it really depends on the problem that you're solving for. So we're building this orchestration layer that enables the different elements to coexist and gives the developers the tools to actually combine them so that they can best solve for any given problem or use case that they're interested in. And specifically about AI and The complexity, we're targeting a layer on top of privacy enhancing technology.
00:26:01.303 - 00:27:04.191, Speaker D: So there's like a major gap of technology missing between privacy enhancing technologies and the applications, in this case AI. That gap has been filled traditionally in computer science with tons of technology like binary trees, algorithms, algorithms about sorting, algorithms about representation of problems as graphs, algorithms as greedy programming, linear programming. So there's like a ton of research that has been done over decades and decades of computer science that is kind of missing here. So we're specifically targeting for that gap in the AI vertical. And one thing that we've done is to innovate or pioneer the use of some techniques taken from image processing, which is a completely separate field from actually cryptography, specifically targeting something called the discrete wavelet transform, which is like a discrete causing of the Fourier transform. It's called the dwt. And we've ported those techniques into pet.
00:27:04.191 - 00:27:42.595, Speaker D: So we can run them on top of fhe, we can run them on top of MPC and actually accelerate the bottlenecks that you typically found in AI. Those bottlenecks are mostly around devaluation of nonlinear functions. That's the activations functions that you have, or the normalization layers. All of those are the really tough questions or problems to solve efficiently in AI when you run them on top of pets. And these DWT techniques are actually accelerating those significantly by, as I said, taking techniques from another field and porting them into AI on top of pets.
00:27:43.785 - 00:28:23.211, Speaker B: Fantastic. It sounds like you guys have some pretty big gaps to try and fill in, but I'm excited to see where this goes. Thank you so much for joining us. One token that did launch on Ethereum Eigenlayer, Eigen, which I think MOG just passed its market cap, I think either yesterday or the day before. And it's out, I think market cap wise, it's out of the top 100, which is kind of crazy to think about because it was touted as the next big thing for so so long. It is number 114, market capwise, FTB6 bill, which is still obviously very hefty. But I think this is like not really about.
00:28:23.211 - 00:28:47.035, Speaker B: It's a bit about appetite for defi and like infra stuff. But it's also a bit about, I think the team really botched that launch. Like you made people wait four or five months. You didn't build anything during that time. Like you had abses, but people, by that time people had already gone shafted on LSD launches and ABSEs that they were like, yeah, I don't care. And now It's. It feels like it's a claim and dump insta.
00:28:47.035 - 00:28:53.835, Speaker B: Did you guys look into. First of all, did you get. Do you even unstake your stuff yet or are you waiting.
00:28:54.255 - 00:29:04.955, Speaker A: Didn't participate, but Egan is. Or Eigen. It is more like a top 20 token. I think if you're going by FTV.
00:29:05.585 - 00:29:08.725, Speaker B: I am not going by FTV because that doesn't fit my bias.
00:29:09.185 - 00:29:48.285, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, so the. The MOG stat was interesting, but it's still, like, probably a top 20 thing if you're going by FTV. And that's important for the folks to know because valuation definitely matters. There's a lot of people that expected multiples on capital buying Celestia from 10 to $20 at an absolutely absurd valuation. So the folks need to know that. As far as the Egan stuff, like, yeah, I think they're a consequence of, like, the expert expectations are just far too high.
00:29:48.285 - 00:30:18.575, Speaker A: They were far too high from the beginning. Like, I don't think that there's, like, this. I don't think that there is, like, this cabal thing that like, like, does a narrative and, like, plans it and then the market takes it and takes it and runs with it. I think it's a little bit more random, but the market definitely took this narrative too far and really inflated expectations beyond what they were. Like, if you were to take a. A very objective. If you were to do, like, a very objective description of what Egan was.
00:30:18.575 - 00:30:41.137, Speaker A: I might not be 100% right here, but I think I'm directionally right. Like, it's like, it allows you to re. Hypothecate your stake and gain leverage on it. And, like, allows protocols to raise capital. And it's like, not the second coming of security. And even if it was, it's like cash flows kind of matter. The market's valuing this thing on TVL right now.
00:30:41.137 - 00:31:15.525, Speaker A: And, like, we found out a long time ago that TVL is not a valuation metric. Like, it's KPI, and it's like, has varying degrees of utility depending on what you're looking at. But TVL is not the way to look at these things. Like, BlackRock is not valued on its AUM. It's valued as its management fee on that AUM and the cash flows that it produces. So, yeah, there is some Egan controversy, but I think that, you know, the controversy wouldn't be there if the market didn't have these, like, very inflated expectations of what it was capable of.
00:31:16.065 - 00:31:42.579, Speaker B: They also had that. They also had a wallet cell. Did you guys see that and they were like oh, somebody there, somebody impersonated somebody else. So they received these tokens and then they sold them. Which seems so ridiculous to me that like a team like Eigen player can deal with these issues to like to me it seems fake because it seems so stupid. Like you should definitely triple check something like that.
00:31:42.627 - 00:31:48.043, Speaker A: But what, what's what actually happened there? What's the prevailing narrative there?
00:31:48.219 - 00:31:55.643, Speaker B: The. I. I'll. I'll look it up. Just to clarify. So Sham doesn't. Well he doesn't watch this but if he did he would probably get upset.
00:31:55.643 - 00:32:14.865, Speaker B: But as far as I remember it was that somebody impersonated somebody else and got access to certain tokens that were supposed to be vesting. That was not supposed to be vesting. Some something along the lines of somebody impersonated something and then that was a mix up which is stupid. That should not have happened.
00:32:15.525 - 00:32:52.765, Speaker C: Yeah, classic bit of social engineering. I think the community kind of was outraged by the, by the lack of the use of on chain locks investing contracts. Just saying, hey, we're going to have some finance guy manage the funds and make sure that everything vests properly. Feels a bit silly when all of the underlying chain infra and tech is built around tokens and how to manage them. So it does seem a bit silly that if you're going to launch at 6 billion plus FDV that you wouldn't just like have this handled by on chain contracts. But yeah, I don't know.
00:32:53.105 - 00:32:55.445, Speaker B: Does it make you doubt the tech?
00:32:56.665 - 00:33:12.095, Speaker C: No, I don't think it makes me doubt like whatever Igen, you know their DA solutions and what they're building. It's just more of like. I mean that's. It seems like a bit of a silly oversight. When the tools are available do this the. We have the dev talent as well. Right.
00:33:12.835 - 00:33:49.467, Speaker A: When, when these, when, when these like like public mishaps happen it actually becomes really interesting from like an entry perspective. Typically if there's like bad press around a good thing you like like that's great. As someone who needs an entry on a thing. So if you wanted to trade Egan and get that entry like you hope that this news hits but there's no margin of safety. Right. So this is, this is like one of those like we still have a ways to go on margin of safety for this thing by the hack is.
00:33:49.491 - 00:34:04.077, Speaker B: My least favorite trade by the way. It's like I feel like I always. I don't know if it's. You're not supposed to do it. I know but it's like it's fun and. But you always, like you said, you can always get a bit burned by.
00:34:04.101 - 00:34:47.355, Speaker A: The hack has worked in tradfi very well. I buy the hack. I don't know, maybe it's just because I'm closer to crypto now, but these things really like get some reputational, reputational damage from hacks. You know, losing user info in like losing an email list and addresses in tradfi is like very benign to actually losing capital directly in crypto. So I think that it's just much scarier here. So like when, when they do have that, when they do have those hacks, the reputational damage really lingers.
00:34:47.855 - 00:35:31.569, Speaker C: I think the time frames are more impactful here. It's. And you see this frequently I think as well with like smaller projects that get hacked, you know, there may be a buying opportunity if something, if someone gets access to like the mint function and then they run out of tokens to dump, you know, and it can really like absolutely plummet a token's price and that might open up an opportunity where it's like literally $0.01 on the dollar and you would not get that opportunity in tradfi. But over the longer term it's like if it comes back up to any kind of meaningful, you know, relative valuation of its former self, it might just be the slow decline to nothing versus, you know, I think in the tradfi case we don't see so drastic extremes so quickly in most cases unless, unless a company is actually going bankrupt.
00:35:31.657 - 00:36:11.959, Speaker B: So I think the edge with most of these are also kind of gone. Like what you just said Danny, where you track the wallet to see like when the sales, when the hackers sales are done, it's people just front run. So the whatever return you got, the 4050 is now like 15 20. But with Eigen I wanted to kind of bring up two other. I feel like restaking just hasn't done particularly well and like a lot of people could have seen this coming I guess. But like apart from talking about is the yield going to be good? Like something that everybody was discussing six months ago. But yes, the execution has also just not been great.
00:36:11.959 - 00:36:39.979, Speaker B: Eigen layer had this mishap. Apart from that they bought, I think they botched the token launch. Like I think four months is way too long to wait to launch a token to give somebody like to just tell people we'll do it in September. Nope, vote nothing. Karak is obviously struggling. People don't really talk about it. And symbiotics Twitter has been hacked for three, four Days it's supposed to be like the second biggest restaking thing trying to compete against Eigen Layer.
00:36:39.979 - 00:37:04.637, Speaker B: And to me this is so ridiculous because you can't go on their website because you're like if I wanted to restake or I can't, I'm not going to take that risk. Like their Twitter sacked. I'm not even sure if their website. Zack. I'm relying on some discord server which often get hacked or with their telegram which might also get hacked. So it's like nobody can use your product. What are you supposed to do? It's just like a ridiculous thing.
00:37:04.637 - 00:37:24.645, Speaker B: I don't know. And like this should never have been an Ethereum narrative. I think restaking is just not. It's very sexy narrative. We could have come up with something better. But even let's say it is the Ethereum narrative, like it is whatever was touted for two years. Sriram is the golden boy of California.
00:37:24.645 - 00:37:38.625, Speaker B: He's going to save all of Ethereum. You nobody can use any of these things without either getting dumped on by some random guy who got an email because he like identified himself as an investor or you just can't use any of these. I don't know. What do you guys think?
00:37:39.805 - 00:38:28.917, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean it's a continuation of what we've said, right? Just like poor execution, like super inflated expectations. I mean look, it didn't make sense from the beginning, right? Like Egan Layer was like, oh, we're going to re hypothecate its security and launch all these new things because there's a shortage of security out there. And that's what everyone like really, really wants. They, they want to rehypothecate this Eth. It'll, you know, a thousand flowers will bloom, whatever. And I don't know, I think that the smart market participants were just like sitting there scratching their head like, okay, this is pure rehypothecation, like use. Why not just use other things than Eth and Egan Layer raised like 160, 170 million based on that narrative.
00:38:28.917 - 00:38:55.465, Speaker A: Symbiotic came out and raised 6 million and said we'll let you re hypothecate anything. So I don't know, the narrative was like, it was very, very forced. And I think anyone who was being objective at the time saw that. And look, I mean it was, it was a tough time. I'll give folks the benefit of the doubt. Like this was like the emerging narrative out of the bear market. Like people were looking for hope perhaps.
00:38:55.465 - 00:39:24.757, Speaker A: But look, I just think that the Industry needs to focus on being less impressionable. These narratives, they're mostly nonsense at the end of the day. Like size up the fucking cash flows. Even like Celestia traded to like what a $20 billion valuation. People were peddling this modular money narrative. It was nonsense. For anyone looking out from the inside or sorry look, looking in from the outside was left scratching their head.
00:39:24.757 - 00:40:29.175, Speaker A: Understanding how little, how little fees DA would generate versus that valuation did not make sense. I think that this will be a good cycle for like, like, for lack of a better term, like the educate, like the, like the education of the crypto space. We're shifting from this very like narrative trader driven environment to like this more valuation focused environment. I'm not saying that we're going to get there tomorrow, but it's incumbent upon the liquid market to participants, participants to be less impressionable. Like it's all, it's all on you. Like look at these valuations, reason about them, look at them versus tradfi comps, right? Like why is your series a thing like raising at a $2 billion valuation when Series A SaaS products are raising at like, like a hundred million to four hundred million? Like there's a, there's a delta there that you need to seriously think about and adjust like your risk and margin of safety parameters accordingly.
00:40:29.795 - 00:41:12.919, Speaker B: I'm gonna make a counterpoint here and if you are trading based on like you can buy and sell based on cash flow, it's very good. But if you're not, don't try and trade something that obviously is, has very little cash flows and it's just like very over inflated. And what I mean by this is if you're gonna play the narrative or whatever the speculation game, do play with something that can't be valued real. Like actually, you know, Tao, you can't value Tao because it's, there's no cash flows, nothing. It's just mumbo jumbo AI mumbo jumbo. It's the bitcoin of AI or whatever people say. But you know what I mean? Like if you're going to speculate and do something NAR, don't do it on like Celestia which is making 30 grand a year on 20 bill value like FTV.
00:41:12.919 - 00:41:58.815, Speaker B: Do it on something that's you just can't value. Like play the game, but play it seriously. Don't play it like on some thousand x multiple on some dog that people are going to dump on you. And I don't know like this NFA not financial advice, but to me that's why the L1 trade has always been super exciting and has been lucrative because you can never like really do a proper cash flow model on it. Ryan will for sure try. He'll pull up his Excel and he'll, he'll run the numbers. But realistically, like, compared to a GPU marketplace Celestia Eigenlayer, you really can't value it as well as like, you can't value it an L1 the same way that you can value these other things which are very clearly businesses.
00:41:58.815 - 00:42:00.485, Speaker B: Here comes angry.
00:42:00.525 - 00:42:03.425, Speaker A: Ryan disagree.
00:42:03.765 - 00:42:05.821, Speaker B: No, but you have.
00:42:05.893 - 00:42:54.905, Speaker A: Okay, I'm gonna, you can value all of those things. I think the reason that the L1 trade worked for so long is because they, they probably should be in the billions if they generate any meaningful like, like activity. A billion dollar valuation does make sense. They are platforms and platforms like accrue value massively and they have like very strong network effects. So if you were like, like, look there, there was a, there was a time in crypto where the platforms were very misvalued. Right? Think of anything trading in 2019, like I think Solana launched at a $200 million valuation, very reasonable by traditional financial standards. Like maybe a little rich at the time given like no one really knew what these crypto things would be.
00:42:54.905 - 00:43:44.465, Speaker A: But like $200 million FTV, fantastic. The market over the subsequent like 24 months like understood how powerful these platforms would be. They under, they began to understand that proof of stake accrues cash flows and that like even if they didn't want to value them that way and they believe the money thing like they could. And now you're seeing kind of like an over correction there right where, or sorry, like you're seeing like some corrective forces there where like the marginal platform is not getting the same valuation because the market just can't handle it. There's not enough fees to go around. So I think of something like blast. That's like really re rated and didn't get the valuation of its peers.
00:43:44.465 - 00:43:55.077, Speaker A: So you have this like, you have this like, you know, you have this classic hype cycle but, but the market is understanding how to value these things. So it is very, very clear.
00:43:55.181 - 00:44:56.865, Speaker C: I, I do think if you look at something like tia, it is kind of the perfect example of this similar to, to L1s where, you know, I think in this market in, in crypto especially you have participants and investors who like their mindset for the future is that like these networks will power, you know, billions of users transacting on them. And so I think, you know, People, they, they pull up a Celestia and they, they pontificate about what it can do. And, and they're, they're thinking is like this thing is going to process like gigabytes and terabytes and petabytes of data availability and be worth so much. But then when you look at it today, it's like, you know, the actual revenues and usage are nowhere near that. They're, they're, they're basically zero. And so then you just, you end up in this, in this game where, you know, you can play the valuation and it's basically nothing. Or, you know, you, you fight over like the marketing team who's trying to angle this as like it, it can be so valuable because, you know, the asset will be used here and there.
00:44:56.865 - 00:45:23.235, Speaker C: It's, you know, it's modular money. It's. We've got all these meaningful things, we'll be able to issue assets on different chains, et cetera. I think you're just. In this space, we've gone from like the full speculative angle to now it's like there's this, this kind of war being waged in between the Ryans of the world looking for real, you know, real cash flows and the people who are still clinging to the idea of like, no, but in 10 years it's like it's going to be decentralized NASDAQ so I can value it up like on these future cash flows.
00:45:23.275 - 00:45:58.149, Speaker B: Right, okay, but even if the, the argument, I guess, is like this, if Solana onboards a billion people, it might actually go like 50x like in terms of fees and everything. Like it might make sense if Celestia onboards 1 billion people. It will like, it'll be at the FTV itself right now because it makes no money. It has no. Do you know what I mean? It's like if you're going to tire, I, I can't do English idioms, but you know what I mean? Like, if you're gonna bet on a horse, bet on something that is like silly. Don't. And like that you can't really value.
00:45:58.149 - 00:46:20.183, Speaker B: Don't bet on like the thing that's just never going to make sense. Sense. And yeah, that's really it. And Ryan, you know how you said you disagree? This is the exact same response that Shriram would give. Do you see this? This is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. It's him arguing with Toly and then he says, what? Sorry, it makes no sense. It's just so funny.
00:46:20.183 - 00:46:34.775, Speaker B: But that's not very relevant. So you can't disagree with that point, right? That me saying if you're gonna do speculation, do speculation that might actually lead to something. Don't do it on something that's already. Yeah.
00:46:36.515 - 00:47:01.855, Speaker A: Yeah, you should exit one part of the market and go to the other part of the market where people are playing a completely different game. Like that exists in crypto. I think that's going to exist forever. Given the permissionless nature and like the, the like. Look, retail has a revealed preference for like not valuing things. They don't want to play the traditional financial game, they want to play the silly game. And that's totally cool.
00:47:01.855 - 00:47:22.035, Speaker A: And that's going to exist forever. It existed in dot com stocks, it existed on the Internet forums of the dot com bubble. It exists on crypto Twitter today. And there's always going to be a place in the market for that. So no doubt. How big is is it going to be versus everything else? Like I don't know, Danny.
00:47:25.415 - 00:47:31.795, Speaker B: Both. The what Tulip bubble chart. That's how we're valuing these things.
00:47:33.055 - 00:47:53.903, Speaker A: I do, I do want to comment on one thing that Danny paid lip service to very quickly. It's the. This asset will be used everywhere. Like therefore it should have a higher valuation. It's like, okay, what does that mean when people say that? They're like, oh, like it's going to be like one, it's used for gas. I won't get into that. It's a can of worms.
00:47:53.903 - 00:48:19.853, Speaker A: But then they're like, oh, like it'll be used in defi. Like it'll be a trading pair. It'll be like locked in smart contracts. Like okay, Apple stock is the most probably used equity on the planet. It is available to margin across every custodian in the United States. It's a very like relatively low volume, high cash flow earning equity. Like there's a ton of market cap there, there.
00:48:19.853 - 00:49:08.457, Speaker A: If you are going to lever your stock portfolio, you effectively like make that Apple stock like tvl. And people tried to like justify this like, okay, I can put ETH in a smart contract, therefore it should have valuation premium. Like everyone effectively puts Apple in a smart contract every day in tradfi to lever up their portfolio and to get margin. And there's no valuation premium like Apple's trading in a meaningful range throughout its life cycle. It does not look like pie in the sky valuation trading at like 500 times sales like eth does or sorry 200 times sales rather 400 times sales depending on the look back period. So I don't know, it's, it's one of these narratives that just like has to die. Like, oh, I can put in a smart contract, therefore it deserves a premium.
00:49:08.457 - 00:49:18.735, Speaker A: Like no, that dynamic exists in Tradfi. There's no observable valuation premium for things that people use to put in, to effectively put in smart contracts.
00:49:19.875 - 00:49:28.403, Speaker B: Yeah, but there's no deflation. Pull up, let's pull up the E burn chart. There's no Apple burn chart. But no, but in.
00:49:28.499 - 00:49:38.135, Speaker A: No, there's a buyback yield, there's Apple buyback. I don't know if it's deflationary, but there is, there are deflationary forces.
00:49:38.555 - 00:50:26.831, Speaker B: This is just the general, like we're always kind of fighting equity versus currency. Like, is this claims on cash flow? Gary Gensler, lock me up. Or is it like, is it going to be the next currency of the United States of America? Obviously not, but you know what I mean? And that's why I'm saying these things can be valued, silly. Because like you said, it makes no sense that it's cool that Ethereum can be used as a base pair. I'm not sure if it demands a huge valuation multiple just because of that, but it is like it, it feeds into this currency narrative. It feeds into this, this is like ultrasound money narrative. At one point you want to be out of the ultrasound money because you might find out that it's not as ultrasound when liquidity dries up.
00:50:26.831 - 00:51:08.455, Speaker B: But until then I think it's a lot easier to. I guess this is like, I don't want to be the guy that clings on to the past speculation thing. But on the other hand, I also don't want to only trade cash flows or like buy into cash flows because I think crypto offers evaluation multiple. I don't know if it like require like if it necessitates it, but it does have it and some things have it as opposed to something like they just don't generally don't have it. Like actual very cash flowy businesses, harder to put valuation. Especially like that's why they went with the modular money narrative. Like Celestia was pushing that really hard just because they were like, oh, I want like this to have the valuation multiple.
00:51:08.455 - 00:51:28.791, Speaker B: It just didn't work out. So it's kind of a tough balance to find. I think like you don't want to mid with everything and not to say cash flows are met with, but you know what I mean? Like you don't want to be like, oh, this doesn't have any Cash flows I can buy. Maybe not for Ethereum. Ethereum is not doing very well but it's kind of a tough balance. Do you get what I'm trying to say? I didn't, I did not say this well at all.
00:51:28.863 - 00:52:39.587, Speaker C: Like I, I, I think if you look at certain periods it's and, and assets it's like it's fair to discuss this point because like if you look at the interest around GMX for example in those types of designs back in 23 like there was a lot of focus around like this real yield narrative and there, there was you know like a cash flowing sort of business there. But it's like you know it be the due to the nature of like how easy it is for competitors to spring up in this space. It's like you could have a very like nicely cash flowing business but someone can copy your model and add a few features and like do a points program and then every, all of your users move over there and then they have the cash flow and you lost it all. And then you know, your valuation creators 10x it's like it can these, these things can, can be chugging along and just suddenly get, get the bottom eaten out from them and that can happen very quickly. Now obviously you can react to that right? Like if you see the activity going down in real time then you know you can, your thesis can change about you know, where the cash flows are going. But you know a lot of these things are somewhat tied together. Not that you know, not that if evaluation is tied to their cash flows that it's you know, purely fueled by speculation.
00:52:39.587 - 00:52:57.865, Speaker C: But the users and like the people that are using those applications and driving the valuation based on you know, the fees and the metrics today, you know they're speculating on like well what's the next step that I need to go use and if they're going to decide to go come off of GMX and go to some other you know, purpose location then it's going to change things.
00:52:58.405 - 00:53:01.065, Speaker A: How long does a narrative trade last? Three months?
00:53:01.805 - 00:53:05.745, Speaker B: I don't know. Maybe 6e has been going on for eight years.
00:53:07.765 - 00:53:14.325, Speaker C: I don't know. Look at BTC. It launched in I don't know.
00:53:14.405 - 00:53:15.101, Speaker B: I.
00:53:15.293 - 00:53:54.065, Speaker A: You brought everything it I'm going to ask our data team to do if they can do this how easy it would be to spin up this analysis. I would imagine that ETH as a base asset and a trading pair has gone down in volume terms over time as USDC and USDT have become more prevalent on chain certainly on Sexes. But also on chain. I would bet that ETH is a very low percentage of pair. Pair trades, I guess you call it. You know, we'll get back to you next episode on that.
00:53:54.605 - 00:53:58.437, Speaker B: We can pull it up. Right now. I just need to find the dune. Danny.
00:53:58.501 - 00:53:59.465, Speaker A: Oh, that exists.
00:53:59.925 - 00:54:03.545, Speaker B: Yeah. Danny, can you make some filler conversation while I look for this?
00:54:04.205 - 00:54:09.541, Speaker C: Yeah. So Tulip Mania was actually followed by several other cycles of flowers.
00:54:09.733 - 00:54:29.473, Speaker A: I. I wanted to. I wanted to actually talk about this, which was willing prices into existence. Saw that in the notes. This is also like a part of narrative trading, which. Which again, like, a lot of people got burned on this cycle and past cycles. Like, I think of Jito, I think of tia.
00:54:29.473 - 00:54:56.235, Speaker A: I think of like something like. Or as these, like three categories of willing prices into existence. Like a crowd gets behind a thing. And maybe even with like fill the wick. Remember, like, ETH traded up to four or two and then it was like, feel the wick. Like, everyone was saying, like, jito needs to be at $10. Everyone was saying that, like, T is going to hit 51 or equals 1.
00:54:56.235 - 00:55:30.875, Speaker A: BTC is like this rallying cry. How many historical instances of like these rallying cries, like narratives have actually worked out for folks? I think you want to fade that every single time. Because why are people going to wait if something's going to get to 100 ends at 50 today, why are people going to wait until it gets that number when they know everyone else is going to sell? Because, like, that's the price target. Like, they. I don't know. You see, you see smart people kind of pedaling these narratives, and it's a little disappointing.
00:55:31.495 - 00:55:33.463, Speaker B: No, he's disappointed in me.
00:55:33.599 - 00:55:45.993, Speaker C: No, it's always. It's always a fade. And I think the most famous example that even normies will know is doge to a dollar. And obviously it did not hit a dollar. It peaked out around 70 cents with the SNL appearance to hit a dollar.
00:55:46.089 - 00:56:00.925, Speaker B: Cycle for sure, guys. Doge to a dollar. It just makes sense. Ryan, I found the chart that you are interested in. And am I happy to say that I was right. This is so. This is just arbitrum.
00:56:00.925 - 00:56:12.539, Speaker B: Obviously, the USCC wear the we weave pair. Wef. I've never said that out. Actually, it has the highest volume. I'll go through all of them.
00:56:12.587 - 00:56:16.455, Speaker A: But it's but the. But that's usdc.
00:56:17.235 - 00:56:20.547, Speaker B: Yeah, but like, if you see this, for example, on base, it's all both.
00:56:20.571 - 00:56:23.739, Speaker A: Usdc or they're both are the highest pairs.
00:56:23.787 - 00:56:33.241, Speaker B: These are all eve pairs. So like, I mean, I guess you can just ignore the first one, but the rest are, I mean it's not the highest, but the first one has.
00:56:33.273 - 00:56:43.577, Speaker A: More volume than the sum of everything below it. If you look at on base it's a USDC pair. It has more than the sum of everything below it.
00:56:43.601 - 00:56:59.263, Speaker B: Yeah. On Ethereum it's even worse. If you see it's one bill for USDC W eve USDTW same and the same for us like the second USDC if pool has triple the wbtc we like the Right.
00:56:59.319 - 00:57:01.167, Speaker A: Yeah. So, no, so I, so what I.
00:57:01.191 - 00:57:10.035, Speaker B: Said was my, so I'm not happy. I was wrong. I'm gonna kill myself.
00:57:11.695 - 00:57:22.191, Speaker A: I think the first one was more to your point. I don't think the volume disparity was that large on Arbitrum, but maybe I didn't. You, you, you, you closed the page so quickly I couldn't see well because.
00:57:22.263 - 00:57:32.475, Speaker B: We found out that I was wrong. So I had to close the page as quickly as possible. Who would have guessed that the US dollar is more valuable to people than Ethereum or like that it's worth more trading that than.
00:57:34.135 - 00:57:52.765, Speaker A: Crypto has a revealed preference for dollars. In every instance where people have, you know, had the choice to use ETH or BTC or dollars for payments and remittances and trading pairs, they've chosen crypto people have chosen, have chosen USDC and usdt.
00:57:53.105 - 00:58:02.993, Speaker B: Not just crypto people, all people ever to have ever existed just except before where everybody was like, oh, we want gold. Now it's just very clearly we want the dollar.
00:58:03.169 - 00:58:31.127, Speaker C: I think there are very few people who are, you know, making all their trades and denominating their, their portfolio value purely in eth. I think it's, you know, if, if I'm doing something in defi, sure I might have ETH and then maybe I want to restake my eth etc and like earn that yield. But if it's the question of, you know, swapping for another asset or doing something else, trading in and out, then in my mind I'm, you know, we're thinking in, in US dollar terms it's, it's not how much am I trading in eth.
00:58:31.311 - 00:59:07.181, Speaker B: It always feels so forced when you see people on the timeline and they're like, oh, like they, they treat EF as money. I'm like, yeah, do you, you know, I don't know, do you? But it's always like obviously defy OGs and stuff. So I imagine they're just like goofing around a bit. I feel like this is the type of like right now is when people do denominate an Ethan sold though, they're just like, oh, like I'm just, I trade something. Let's say I buy mudang, sell it, I'm going back into Solana or on if. Whatever they're trading on. If these days you buy, sell, go back into Eve.
00:59:07.181 - 00:59:15.993, Speaker B: But it's not the same as like what we're saying where it's like you're not denominating, you're just trying to get to a certain if amount and sol amount and not like, oh, I have exol.
00:59:16.129 - 00:59:55.895, Speaker C: That'd be better. I do think there are people certainly during these exciting bull market periods, you certainly see people who are looking to increase their balance of total ETH or total sol, total btc. Pick your favorite asset in the space and kind of hope to ride that thing up and trade other assets into it and grow that balance. But you know, I think ultimately in their mind as well, like when they want to cash out and go do things in the real world, they're looking at, you know, USD or their local currencies so that they can buy a house, buy, you know, real world assets, if you want to call them that, etc.
00:59:56.195 - 01:00:20.989, Speaker B: I will say one thing. If you're listening to the spot, I don't think you will. I hope that my, the listeners are not this type of person. But eventually, please don't fall for that. Like I'm going to try and fall for the super cycle narrative and be like, oh, why would I denominate in Fiat, man? Everything is BTC and eth. Do not fall for it because I don't know, do whatever you want. Nfa, it's your life.
01:00:20.989 - 01:00:36.395, Speaker B: Live your life as you want to. But I think that's a good place to end it. I've come off wrong six times in a row. I think that's a new, new record on the spot. Is there anything that you guys want to, you guys want to say.
01:00:38.175 - 01:00:39.515, Speaker A: Go to Permissionless?
01:00:40.735 - 01:00:43.315, Speaker B: Yeah, tomorrow. It might be a bit late now.
01:00:43.975 - 01:00:46.995, Speaker A: We'll talk to, we'll talk fundamentals at Permissionless.
01:00:48.735 - 01:00:57.085, Speaker C: You can see the Heath versus Soul debate. You can talk fundamentals with Ryan. You can see some fights happen.
01:00:58.665 - 01:01:00.325, Speaker B: Are they doing fights this year?
01:01:01.505 - 01:01:07.161, Speaker C: Yeah, it's. Is it David Hoffman or is it.
01:01:07.353 - 01:01:11.361, Speaker A: Yeah, Bankless and guy from Synthetics.
01:01:11.433 - 01:01:12.705, Speaker C: I think the other guy.
01:01:12.825 - 01:01:15.977, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, a guy from Synthetics.
01:01:16.001 - 01:01:18.765, Speaker C: I mean that should be interesting, honestly, you know, a little.
01:01:19.145 - 01:01:19.521, Speaker B: It's.
01:01:19.553 - 01:01:30.663, Speaker C: It's like you're saying box people want to get silly on chain. People want to get silly at permissionless. So, you know, go see the fight, go watch the eth, you know, L2s or Solana etc debates. Get in on all the action.
01:01:30.839 - 01:01:37.955, Speaker B: I want to see Kyle Somani dunk on who? Who's on that pod? Westy Capital. I want to see him dunk on West Sea Capital.
01:01:40.295 - 01:01:40.631, Speaker A: Right.
01:01:40.663 - 01:01:41.595, Speaker B: What were you saying?
01:01:43.295 - 01:01:48.079, Speaker A: Cryptos. PMF is online debating and now fights. Clearly.
01:01:48.127 - 01:01:49.167, Speaker B: And conferences.
01:01:49.351 - 01:01:54.075, Speaker A: And getting silly on chain conferences and confrontation conferences.
01:01:57.135 - 01:01:58.135, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's good.
