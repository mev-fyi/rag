00:00:00.400 - 00:00:32.723, Speaker A: I'd say the market is still pretty young and one thing I think about oftentimes is like at least when I used to do like, I don't know, more liquid stuff or trade on my own. Am I going too deep into this analysis? Like for example trying to do sum of parts in crypto is pretty pointless right now because like nobody thinks that deeply. I feel like most coins basically trade on like short term narratives that might not even always be like fundamentally sound.

00:01:24.275 - 00:01:33.295, Speaker C: What's up guys? Welcome back to another episode of 0x research. Today I'm joined by Ryan Connor from the Blockworks research team as well as Brick from Entropy and Jose from Spartan.
00:01:33.875 - 00:01:37.339, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:01:37.347 - 00:01:44.295, Speaker C: They should be familiar with you. But Jose, maybe you want to give a little background on yourself and then Brick, you can also talk a bit about Entropy as well.
00:01:44.925 - 00:02:45.433, Speaker D: Absolutely, yeah, I can go first. So let me start with the background of Spotan and then I can introduce myself. So Spotan is broadly composed of three main pillars. First the fundamental driven hedge fund where we take long term views and also catalyst driven trades in altcoins that we're bullish on and this is basically where I spend my time on. Secondly, there's the venture arm with two funds focused on DeFi and infrastructure and the other one focuses on gaming and lastly is like an advisory team that handles M and a fundraising and economics design for myself. I got into crypto during college while I was on an international exchange in the US around 2021 when crypto was going parabolic started like gator farming, flipping NFTs mainly to cover like these expenses that I was having on the exchange. Yeah, it was like my way of earning something extra in crypto.
00:02:45.433 - 00:03:47.597, Speaker D: And I guess what drew me to work in this space is actually like, I really like the meritocracy of it from a double perspective. First, because there is a lot of alpha and if you work and spend time on it, you can discover these so called undervalued tokens either by reading a lot of governance proposals, looking at dashboards or creating ones yourself. You know how to program with Dune SQL. Yeah, there are like a lot of marketing efficiencies and that's opportunity. And the second aspect is that if you basically like spend a lot of time and you want to work in the space, you can just get out there, start delivering actual insights and you will get recognized. And that's basically what coming to Spot and have been in the fund for one year and a half and yeah, mainly focusing on liquid markets. And I remember meeting Brick on Twitter back in the days when I was doing the first interviews and he started doing that also at Blog Works and now here we are.
00:03:47.781 - 00:03:58.185, Speaker C: Fantastic. Yeah, I completely agree with you on the meritocracy thing. I think it's quite underrated about crypto. You can do stuff like you can just do stuff and people will notice and you can make money because it's very inefficient.
00:03:58.685 - 00:03:59.465, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:04:02.735 - 00:04:53.215, Speaker A: I am here for you. Yeah. Going back to that beautiful moment, Jose, to be on the podcast which one of the first people in the crypto industry I really like connected with. And yes, I said I quickly joined Blockworks after that. Most probably know me who are listening to this podcast like through that, but recently transferred over to Entropy where basically if you want to put it in Threadfi terms, a consulting firm or akinto a consulting firm. We're currently in an exclusive deal with Arbitrum trying to make the DAO more efficient, basically writing governance proposals, trying to align key stakeholders, doing all of that good stuff. We've been in the deal for two months now.
00:04:53.215 - 00:05:02.095, Speaker A: Things are going really well. A lot of interesting stuff going on on that front. Thanks for inviting me on this podcast, guys.
00:05:02.395 - 00:05:39.365, Speaker C: Thanks for coming on. I. I think I want to talk about Arbitrum and then we'll also talk about Unicane. We talked about it a bit before we started to our listeners. But to get started, the main reason that I wanted to have both of you guys on as well as Ryan Connor is I traded basically exclusively on narratives as well as some, I guess, like fundamental stuff. But as far as I've seen both on your Twitter, like Brick, I, I knew you, I don't really know you that well anymore, but I, when I did know you and Ryan Connor as a big cash flow guy. How much do you think fundamentals matter within crypto? Ryan left.
00:05:39.365 - 00:05:42.465, Speaker C: He doesn't like talking about this topic. But maybe we can start off with.
00:05:43.285 - 00:06:36.085, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean he's clearly the big boss now if he can just like leave the podcast, come back in when he wants to. Huh. But yeah, I think fundamentals really matter. But I'd say the market is still pretty young and one thing I think about oftentimes is like at least when I used to do like, I don't know, more liquid stuff or trade on my own, now I'm just, you know, full time entropy guy. Don't really have time to trade that much anyway. Like one thing I always thought about is like, am I going too deep into this analysis? Like for example, trying to do sum of parts in crypto is pretty pointless right now because like nobody thinks that deeply. Another example would be people don't think far enough in the future.
00:06:36.085 - 00:07:30.115, Speaker A: I feel like most coins basically trade on short term narratives that might not even always be fundamentally sound. And cash flow to token holders isn't really a thing. It's more about is this protocol making a lot of fees or revenue even though there's no clear way to actually earn those fees. As a token holder, the value flow can go somewhere completely else. But the main thing that I feel like a lot of coins trade on are those high level numbers. And the industry is still in a point where a lot of people disagree on even the basics. What's the P and L or what's the income of an L1 or can you even build that for an L1? And like what are operating or.
00:07:30.115 - 00:08:17.435, Speaker A: Well I guess, yeah, like what are operating costs for DCEL to. I don't know, I'm kind of yapping here. But I guess my point is that there's like no standardized way or well adapted way yet to like value a lot of these things as well as then people don't look into the future like far enough in my opinion. Which then makes the like investing scheme completely different from Trad 5. Well you have like funds that start like you know, they talked with the C Corp. They're trying to figure out like especially more stable industries like oh, what's going to happen to like this company in like six years or seven years out in the future. And here it's more about like oh, what's going to happen today? What's going to be the big narrative.
00:08:17.435 - 00:08:20.275, Speaker A: That's my 2 cents, I guess.
00:08:22.605 - 00:08:47.963, Speaker D: I totally agree. I think we or the space has to agree on those. On those things and but it's also like where the space is going. I think it may not be trading on fundamentals now, but it will be increasingly trading on. We're seeing that right now for in two things. It's like sell side and buy side and buy side sell side is getting better fundamental based coverage here. Block works obviously.
00:08:47.963 - 00:10:02.011, Speaker D: So we are seeing like this growing number of research companies and data providers, Dune Analytics, Defy Llama, Kaido bloggers, research dashboards on Celestia, Solana and all of that. And then on the buy side I think if you think like crypto is growing 10x then the incremental buyer is likely to be a liquid fund which is more of like institutional player training, fundamental based approach. Right? Yeah. And actually there's like this new thing that I don't know if you guys know bit club but Jason from Folius released it a few months ago and it's where kind of a space, a value investors club where analysts and liquid guys share investment thesis, they share their frameworks and many people there can play devil's advocate into asking questions and kind of contesting some thesis and it's pretty cool. And again yeah the space may not be fundamental based right now, but it will be and it will be increasingly be more. But again like not ivory tower like you have to be crypto native. I'm a DJ at heart and for me fundamentals like aren't always revenue, even cash flows to token holders.
00:10:02.011 - 00:10:39.557, Speaker D: I think that's like kind of a limited way of seeing it. Fundamentals are like what's important for the market right now and where the market is tracking for a specific, a specific protocol. You briefly mentioned it even for per taxes rather than cash flow return to token holders. Like more most people just focus on poor volume or volume based market shares. Why? Because it's like easily accessible on Defy Llama. Because Defy Llama right now it's pretty much like the only agreed data provider side where most of the people look at if they want to buy a token or if they want to compare to like a basic relative valuation. Same for lending protocols.
00:10:39.557 - 00:11:19.913, Speaker D: If you look at historical correlations, they're mostly correlated on TVL and not really on volley on earnings. And why? Again because it's easily accessible on Defy Llama. And yeah, and to briefly mention here, I actually think one of the main reasons why Solana has been doing Great since last year is probably because of you guys at Bloodwork. Solana Data, your good coverage and also the fact that relative value trades historically have been performing good. ETH was kind of having troubles with the narrative. That was the opportunity for Solana. Solana found its way with the min coins and yeah, that's pretty much, I.
00:11:19.929 - 00:12:03.833, Speaker A: Guess, two things too, I want to kind of touch on that you talked about. First one would be, I want to be definitely clear on the fact that value investing kind of still works. And I think a good example of that. Not to glaze you too much, Jose, but like the across stuff you posted about on Twitter, it was across, right? Like six months ago or whatever. And like, nobody was really paying attention to that. So that's just, to me, like you're thinking about that market vertical in a very fundamental way. And there's like no clear, like, kind of narrative right now that's like, easy to market or was back in the day.
00:12:03.833 - 00:12:18.605, Speaker A: And then suddenly, like, it's a good, fundamentally good project. It starts, like, expanding a lot and then the market, like, catches on to it. And I thought that was a really good example of like, kind of how you should do liquid investing in crypto.
00:12:19.145 - 00:12:52.519, Speaker D: Yeah, I, to be honest, like, I got into the cross trade, can call it that, just by trying the products, like, I was bridging all the time and I tried every breach out there and across was the fastest and the cheapest one. Then I got into like, why is this happening? Like, is there some trade off in security out there? And it wasn't. It's just a good mechanism design. And then you start, like talking to the team. You build the thesis, you see kind of where the species going and you build like a growth story, right?
00:12:52.687 - 00:13:49.993, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And then the second part, I guess this goes out to the Blockworks panel. How do you feel about the whole Solana stuff with especially, I think what the market is now kind of attaching itself to is purely what you guys call, I guess, real economic value, which is basically like transaction fees plus then MEV tips or judo tips. And if you look at, for example, Ethereum, like the chart is. If you map it out in the previous cycle, like the charts are pretty much following each other, right? Where like the fees explode kind of in a bull market and then they just like immediately drop. So I guess what I'm asking is, like, where do you see Solana's future? Because what happens if Meme coin trading basically leaves the chain? What's the next thing that can uphold.
00:13:50.049 - 00:14:24.825, Speaker C: The narrative apart From Meme Coins leaving. My whole thing has like these past few weeks, Solana gets really, really congested to the point that I don't like Meme Coins leaving might not be the issue, but I think the big issue that it's going to face is congestion and just transactions consistently failing throughout the bull. I think that's like I don't think Meme Coins leave because it doesn't make a lot of sense. Sense. Like it's fast, the infrastructure is there, there's ecosystem around it. Like you can borrow on meme coins, you can even short new meme coins for like dumpy fun and stuff. I think their main problem is not going to be Meme Coins leaving, it's going to be the fact that you can't use the chain.
00:14:24.825 - 00:14:43.505, Speaker C: But at that point, do fundamentals matter? Probably not. I think the narrative is going to be oh, like so people are actually using Solana, that's why the chain is down as opposed to Arbitrum or Polygon. You know, Ryan, you can give a more well rounded and good answer.
00:14:44.765 - 00:15:28.853, Speaker E: Yeah. So I think just to kind of like piggyback on what you guys were saying earlier and how much fundamentals matter or don't matter, I think that they objectively matter. The question is always just how much. And I think if you want to explore that, you can kind of like look no further than the sole ETH ratio over the past 12 months. If we look at like this new measure of real economic value called price to real economic value or price to sales. You know, Solana started out the year trading somewhere around 50 times sales, whereas Ethereum was trading at somewhere around 300 times sales. And then that varies depending on your forward growth rate.
00:15:28.853 - 00:15:42.197, Speaker E: Right. But like ETHS was clearly declining. Their growth in Rev is 93% or more off its highs. And the plan is to grow it less. Right. And Solana was going in the precise opposite direction. Right.
00:15:42.197 - 00:16:19.953, Speaker E: Compounding on a year over year basis at like 12, 1200%, something like that. You don't get setups like that in Trad 5, but you had it in crypto and like the sole ETH pair expressed that valuation gap and those forward expectations. Now like, does the market always do that? Like no. Right. Like there's a path dependency to crypto. We started trading like, you know, arbitrary, like pieces of tokens on ledgers and over time they made more money. And over time institutions came in and they started trading marginally based on those fundamentals.
00:16:19.953 - 00:17:10.427, Speaker E: And like the conversations that we have with subscribers, everyone asks me what the Valuations are. Everyone asks about fees, everyone asks where you think the fees are going. I think some of the most well known funds in the space, like, they'll tell you, like, we want to invest on a 12 to 24 month time horizon and we do do some narrative trading, but like, fundamentals are always in the backdrop. Right. So, like, how does that change going forward with more institutions entering the space? Like, I think the answer is very obvious. Like, you probably have a part, a portion of crypto that always trades on, like, silly stuff. And that's fine, it's a permissionless thing, but, like, the capital is going to make these things look more like, you know, stocks or bonds than crypto tokens over the long term.
00:17:10.427 - 00:18:07.995, Speaker E: But things can stay silly for a long time. I think, to answer Brick's question about like, Solana fundamentals and meme coin trading, I think a good analyst will discount that activity to some degree in their forward estimates. I think that a, you know, a good analyst will realize that Solana activity is going to fall 70% or greater in a bear market, but I don't see that being very different from any other chain. I think that historically, you know, this is a very levered space. I think they all fall 70 to 90% in a bear market, as they have historically, as people get wiped out as market makers blow up. Like, it's the only ecosystem on the planet where you can do 100x trading and people do it and it impacts market positioning and price action. So I think a good analyst discounts those things, but with like, the understanding that, like, dude, it's, everyone's going to blow up.
00:18:07.995 - 00:18:30.875, Speaker E: Dan Smith at Blackworks is always pointing out that, you know, if you look at the top gas consumers on ethnic, it's all meme coin trading too. It's like the Pepe pair. Right? So I don't know, Solana is certainly winning with this meme coin activity, but, like, does it matter a lot cross cycle? Like, I don't really think so.
00:18:32.255 - 00:18:55.459, Speaker A: Yeah. I guess what I'm getting at more is like, what's the future there? Like, I, I totally get why the valuation. It's up right now, by the way. You talked about the multiple. I guess similar to price to sales price to real economic value. Like, has he expanded in this, like, recent times or has it kind of stayed stable with Riv growing?
00:18:55.627 - 00:19:17.831, Speaker E: Yeah, if you're gonna, if you're gonna look at an easy way to calculate this is just to take the last one or three months and annualize it. If you just want to normalize for, like, zero growth across the board. And we're trading at a little over a hundred times on Solana. Eth, depending on how you want to slice it, is like, between 200 and 300 times. Yeah. And it. The.
00:19:17.831 - 00:19:22.079, Speaker E: The valuation gap is still there. Right. So.
00:19:22.207 - 00:19:25.607, Speaker A: Well, that's the decentralized premium you get, huh?
00:19:25.751 - 00:19:35.873, Speaker E: Correct. That's the. That. That's money premium. That's decentralization premium. Vitalik premium. I don't know what you want to call it, but it is an objective premium to sol, but not to other chains.
00:19:35.873 - 00:19:53.641, Speaker E: Right. Like, Arbitrum is trading without time boost on a trailing basis at, like, somewhere like, 200 times. Maybe like, 150. I forget. Sui is trading at 2,000 times, like, now. Like, there's a growth story ahead of it. But, like, does Sui have more monetary premium than eth? Like, I don't know.
00:19:53.641 - 00:20:00.685, Speaker E: You tell me. I. You can't parse it from the data. So. Big question mark.
00:20:02.475 - 00:20:15.179, Speaker C: For Brick, what you said. I guess, like, next steps for Solana, apart from Meme coins. I guess it's Deepen. No. Ryan, you a big, deep end guy. But that's, like, the thing that's touted. I.
00:20:15.179 - 00:20:25.379, Speaker C: I don't. I think it could be. I just feel like Deepen isn't a huge, huge fee bringer. I'm not sure though, Ryan. Maybe you're.
00:20:25.427 - 00:21:19.603, Speaker A: I mean, that's kind of what I'm saying here. Like, yeah, you can get activity on your network, but, for example, deep in transactions, I don't think they really would produce that much value for the network itself. And I think this is the trend that we're kind of going towards with everything. So at the end of the day, L1 tokens should be, I guess, valued more on a utility basis or moneyness basis or whatever that comp is there, which isn't an easy task to do. Like, again, someone would need to standardize that. But, like, where I'm getting at with this Solana stuff is that, like, right now, everyone's super hyped about, like, all of this, especially, like, the MEB part of the fees. Like, they're raking in and, like, it's all just meme coin traders getting kind of screwed on the chain.
00:21:19.603 - 00:21:49.149, Speaker A: And my thesis is that that will go away at some point. So, like, do you see kind of the chain being able to compensate for that with something else, or will it more become, like a similar narrative as it has become in the last six to 12 months, where it's like, yeah, we don't actually need like execution fees we can do da even though I feel like that's a bad argument or then like replace those fees with something else.
00:21:49.277 - 00:22:19.995, Speaker C: I will say one thing. Daniel Smith made a good point about the things that the token price doesn't have to be like high and I think like instead of valuing these on utilities or whatever moneyness it the price just might go down because we keep valuing them as fees but they actually make more and more sense. I agree with you though. Brick is like if your bull cases idiots will keep like slamming gas to and paying priority fees to like get their transactions but that's not particularly sustainable.
00:22:20.815 - 00:22:30.375, Speaker A: I I just also just quickly to say I gotta give a disclaimer here. I have nothing against Solana. Solana fanboys and Twitter. Don't don't come after me.
00:22:30.495 - 00:22:41.761, Speaker E: It's all bros. Yeah Jose, I would like to, I would like to hear what you have to think and how spartan things. Yeah but I was yeah I, I.
00:22:41.793 - 00:23:31.245, Speaker D: I always think people find a way on gambling on chain. Like I think there's a secular trade of people wanting to do stuff on chain. If that's gambling, let it be it like if you look is sports betting revenue over the last two years they've been growing like 2x every year. Stake suddenly became like this huge revenue generating company and it's private. We don't know the valuation really but still like it's something that is happening even like here's the AI agents thesis even if it's not like actual users on chain. Maybe it's like AI agents using Solana blockchain as the payment rails for doing all of the AI interactions or I don't know some weird stuff that maybe we are not thinking about yet but it will happen. I'm pretty confident in that.
00:23:31.245 - 00:23:47.445, Speaker D: What Solana or whatever blockchain may be so the gas usage or whatever blockchain may be in the future will be very different from now but it will still be like execution fee driven I think just different I guess. Other stuff.
00:23:47.785 - 00:24:57.785, Speaker E: Yeah to Bachwood asking if deep ins are going to drive a lot of fee activity for the chain. The answer for any sector or token is no. The things that drive fees for the chain are traders who need specific access to pieces of state who want to pay high priority fees because they see some opportunity in front of them. It's a better model than traditional exchanges like the L1 model and that not only are you paying on a per transaction basis but you're also paying on a priority basis. So like what's going to keep traders on chains? It's going to be interesting assets to trade. So the more deepen issuers you have or the more like AAVE and Camino and you know, legit projects issuing their token on your chain, that's going to be the thing that's going to drive fees. So you know what's it's I'm not so much concerned and regarding the Meme Coin thing, I'm not so much concerned with people losing money on Meme Coin activity and that being bad for people because people like to lose money on a lot of things.
00:24:57.785 - 00:25:24.205, Speaker E: Like one of the fastest growing industries in the United States is gambling. It's growing at geez like 5 times the rate of GDP. And every male in my friend group is losing money every week on DraftKings and they're happy as a clam. They do not care. So it doesn't bother me that Meme Coin trading is extractive. I think it's just people having fun. There is some natural cap on that activity.
00:25:24.205 - 00:25:30.645, Speaker E: I don't, I don't know where it is though. If it's anything close to sports betting. Like I don't think we've, I don't think we're there yet.
00:25:31.905 - 00:25:35.645, Speaker A: By the way, your friends are weird because I don't like losing money.
00:25:36.705 - 00:25:44.305, Speaker E: I don't think they like it. They think they have Edge. They don't have realized Edge Chaos Labs.

What are some, I guess specific sectors that you guys have been interested in?
00:26:45.735 - 00:27:32.983, Speaker D: I mean obviously intense, right? I we published a Report this week with the centralized co guys. They're like a research newsletter in the space. It's one of my favorites. And we basically got into how we think the intense, at least cross chain, intense supply chain will play out. What different players will there be and where we see value flowing and yeah like basically briefly there will be like three key players. First the front ends where you basically go it's like your normal dapps think of across Uniswap 1 inch, any front end, any defi front end you go and you select what you want to do on chain. Then you have the solvers, these third party that are sophisticated actors that completes the user orders.
00:27:32.983 - 00:28:33.425, Speaker D: And then the last part of the layer is the settlement network which is the underlying infra that handles settlement settlement understood as intent fulfillment verification. So like the verification that the solver frontend the user on the destination chain that that happened. And also the second part is repaying the solver that fronted the capital so they have to be repaid by the user initial capital on the deposit chain or whatever. So those are the three key players or three key layers. And then where value flows there it's basically solvers getting commoditized and value flowing either upstream to the front ends because they hold the order flow originator power or downstream to the seminal network because they can offer differentiated futures to solvers and charge them for those futures that make their life easier. When solving user orders. I can go deeper into anything there if you like.
00:28:33.425 - 00:28:37.325, Speaker D: Yeah, but that's pretty much the brief roundup.
00:28:37.785 - 00:28:51.045, Speaker C: Ask one question about the value side and that's do you think that wallets will be able to capture any value? Because to me it makes so much sense for Rabi to just introduce some solver network into it.
00:28:51.945 - 00:29:55.061, Speaker D: Exactly, exactly. So the way it will probably work in the future is you will have Rabbit introduce some kind of chat where your average Joe can go on it and say hey I just saw this on Twitter, I want to get exposure to this or let me know what's happening on Twitter and what's my best risk adjusted way of getting exposure to this trade or like to this yield on defi whatever chain it's on and use whatever assets I have on this wallet whether they are on like on a L2 on eth mainnet and you just basically specify that to the solver on a standardized way which is what that standard, the ERC 7 CJ3 enables standardizing hints and orders and you enable the solver to handle all of that for you. So the future is like probably like the wallets introducing this kind of chat that parse the user orders into like an LLM and the LLM spits out an order for the solver.
00:29:55.173 - 00:30:18.205, Speaker C: Yeah, Brooke, I want to get into your thing as well. But before last thing for intense, my biggest fear happened to me last week and I got slipped 8% on intense and that's my like big bear case for intense is I'm getting dominated by toxic flow like sophisticated solver just nobody else fills me and this guy fills me.
00:30:18.665 - 00:30:41.665, Speaker D: That's solvable, that's solo. And the way to solve it is you slash the solver. So you implement like even you can use eigen layer to do that. So you have the solvers post bonds every time you want to solve in your action and if they behave badly like they did with you with 8% slippage, you can just slash them and they will never do it again at least.
00:30:41.705 - 00:30:42.663, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:30:42.679 - 00:31:45.715, Speaker A: I was going to say my knowledge in this vertical is pretty limited, but I guess I want to hear your take on the wallet front of things or commoditizing wallets because basically I saw kind of counter take to what you was just talking about where the take was basically that most apps will introduce their own wallets as well. Which means that at the end of the day like in the future, it's actually the like dapps themselves that get used to have most of the value flow even in that like vertical because like they also own the wallet that the end user is kind of transacting on. And especially if you get into a situation where like you get dapps on your phone or like phone usage in crypto increases more than like you just open a certain app, let's say, I don't know, the vertex app. You go in there and the wallet is just like it's kind of abstracted from you, but the DAPP itself like owns it.
00:31:47.295 - 00:32:17.825, Speaker D: Yeah. So the front end category includes both wallets or dapps. I haven't really think about what's the split between or what's the power dynamics on dapps versus Wallet, but probably still I think the one that is closest to the user which is the wallet. Right. Even when that's abstracted away, if that's the closest thing to the user that should hold the most amount of power on this value flow dynamics and all of that, that will be my only take there.
00:32:18.845 - 00:32:53.349, Speaker E: Yeah, there's this notion that being closer to the end consumer is there's a moat there that, that you get to extract more value. To me that sounds in some Senses it's true. Right. If you own the end user relationship, you should get more value from it. There's like a cost per click analysis that you could do. It's just harder to make those hops. But what about crypto makes that different? I mean like the fact that I can like take my wallet address and just put it into another wallet and like very easily change seems to be like a much lower moat than what you see in Web two.
00:32:53.349 - 00:32:57.625, Speaker E: But I don't know, what about the nature of crypto might change that dynamic, do you guys think?
00:32:58.485 - 00:33:53.589, Speaker A: I mean, I'd want to say that the switching costs should be like exponentially lower. Also taking or like accounting for the fact that like it's just kind of quote unquote easier to become a service provider. Or like the application layer itself. Like if you think about, I don't know, arbitrarily saying Amazon here, like you can't just build up another Amazon like that. And then somebody goes and like can order stuff on your website buying crypto, it's like, oh, let's say this wallet or like this burps Dex is like bad or it has too high fees or whatever. Somebody else can like relatively easily spin up another similar product that should be good and basically just like undercut the other player. But that's not really what has been happening, at least on the wallet side.
00:33:53.589 - 00:34:25.021, Speaker A: Right. Like in my mind metamask is probably. I got no hate against metamask but like one of the worst user experiences I've had. And then like, I of course started out with that switch to Rabi and not endorsed by Rabi, nothing like that. But like that's the kind of EVM wallet I use and it's just like so much better. So so much better. And I actually tried to do some stuff on metamask a few weeks ago again and it just reminded me of like how big the difference is.
00:34:25.021 - 00:34:43.505, Speaker A: And still like, I guess MetaMask is the biggest wallet provider by a large amount maybe. But like it's just mind boggling to me that it's so sweet easy to like switch from one wallet to another or like wallet provider to another and still people keep using the same stuff.
00:34:44.785 - 00:35:07.617, Speaker D: Yeah. And like one example of the amount of power that MetaMask has if you actually look, they introduced a new update feature a few months ago. It's called Smart Transactions. They did it with Mechanism Group. It's basically like an MEB protection where the MEV that gets recaptured from their users actually does not get. It's not like Giving back to. Back to the users.
00:35:07.617 - 00:35:35.929, Speaker D: They just keep it for themselves. It's not like meb Blocker where they give it back. It's not like maybe share from Flashbots where they do give it back. It's just Metamask activating it. And they haven't been really public about it of giving it back yet. But yeah, if you look like historically number of transactions of Ethereum mania that go through the private mempool after that update go through it went from 20% I think to 40%. So it was pretty impactful still.
00:35:35.929 - 00:35:39.925, Speaker D: No, no, let me be back for the ones that have it. Yeah.
00:35:40.345 - 00:36:58.677, Speaker C: About the wallets, Brick, I think you're right. Metamask has like still relatively dominant but is losing market share. But about this topic in general, I think this is actually one of the things that Uniswap does maybe like good for us analysts, like they went out and built out their own wallet app so we can see if that actually impacts their fundamentals. And they're also building out their own chain so we can see if that's going to work out as well. But I think that's got to be what you track like are people actually going to use the Uniswap wallet? Because how easy are they going to make it? Are they going to continue shafting people on the front end, even if it's the wallet? So that'll probably be the best way to keep track of it as opposed to, I don't know, like who else is going to capture the value? I like you said Ryan, I'm not really like sure how relevant wallets will be, but to me it makes a lot like if there was a mobile, mobile app, moonshot, et cetera, and there was a wallet that was as good as that, that to me would be difficult to switch away from. One thing you can do is account abstraction, stuff like Privy and you can make it more difficult for people to take their keys from one service to another. But that seems a bit antithetical to keep the like against.
00:36:58.677 - 00:37:00.305, Speaker C: Not your keys, not your coins.
00:37:01.445 - 00:37:35.399, Speaker E: I mean I think that's kind of next gen crypto user though. Like I hate that I have to be responsible for my own stuff. I want someone to blame if my assets are stolen and I want them to have an insurance policy on that that like immediately top me up if they get hacked. And I'm not going to have that for myself personally. And it's very. There's an established norm around not custodying your own assets and you know, big funds like service providers that do that. Like I'm sure every big fund in the crypto space uses a custodian.
00:37:35.399 - 00:37:48.109, Speaker E: They don't self custody. Right. So I think that's the next wave. And Metamask does have a pro. They have like some custody solution there. Right. Like I think you need one for retail too.
00:37:48.109 - 00:37:51.497, Speaker E: I don't know when. Right. Because it's still crypto natives.
00:37:51.561 - 00:38:05.737, Speaker C: But that's one thing sui does with ZK login. Maybe that's why they have the 2000 multiple, because they have a very good ZK login page. Brick, what about you? What sectors are you focused on?
00:38:05.921 - 00:38:41.665, Speaker A: I mean really just on this one AKA Arbitrum. I haven't really traded in a while. I guess I've talked about this before in the podcast but like what I usually try to do is just like time the cycle. So like I try to buy semi early or if there's like a big catalyst idea I think can run until the end of the cycle. I'll go into that and then if I have like some spare time I try to do some liquid investing. But like I'm still in TIA somewhat. I've been starting to sell on that front.
00:38:41.665 - 00:39:20.675, Speaker A: Like the pump was over. So for context I bought like pretty early after the token generation event or whatever the right term there is held through the massive pump and then imagine that, nah, this narrative will continue. And now it's been at like what six, five, four bucks for a while and I think it's time to start getting out of there. Sold my nier bags I think a few months ago. Did some SUI farming. I actually bought in a pretty bad position. Like not in this recent pump but the pump before that.
00:39:20.675 - 00:40:03.845, Speaker A: I think my average entry was something like 180 or something like that. Then I just started farming, what's it called? Aftermath. And then the market dropped or SUI dropped like what, almost 50%. And I was like yeah, that wasn't the best idea ever. But luckily it came back and I was like yeah, I'm done with this. But other than that I haven't really deeply looked into anything else done outside of arbitrament. Just since I'm super deep working in the ecosystem, not even investing, just looking at kind of how to make the ecosystem better, if that makes sense.
00:40:04.145 - 00:40:06.425, Speaker E: Brick, what are you doing at Arbitrum?
00:40:06.585 - 00:40:09.545, Speaker A: What I'm doing myself or what the team is doing or.
00:40:09.585 - 00:40:13.521, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Want to hear more about Arbitrum and your guys role in it.
00:40:13.673 - 00:40:14.885, Speaker C: Is Sam around?
00:40:15.585 - 00:42:40.275, Speaker A: Well, yes. You want him to jump in here? Yeah, basically we work super closely with the dao, as I said, we have an exclusive contract with them, basically trying to ideate ourselves as well as then gather ideas and consensus from key stakeholders and key thought figures and all of those people to create proposals basically that push the ecosystem forward as well as then introducing new partners to the DAO itself. And I think, for example, what I've been working on for the past, I think a month and a half is called opco, basically a DAO adjacent like legal entity that would have the ability to hire service providers into the legal entity as well as then kind of creating an operations arm for the dao. So you'd get more like of these operational type roles because a lot of daos struggle with the fact that you have one off initiatives that get started which don't play together in any way. There's kind of no mesh layer of information in most ecosystems or in most daos and everyone's just incentivized to push toward their own initiative. And this would kind of be a way to create a unifying factor for all of those initiatives and basically trying to make operations more efficient by I don't want to use the word centralized, but concentrate people into a structure where ecosystem contributors more easily can reach synergies by for example, sharing information more efficiently and getting to a point where everyone's kind of working in a unified manner. Another thing we kind of floated was increasing the base fee for Arbitrum, but that was somewhat contentious so we dropped it because it also seemed that the new meta for L2s is just to pump the gas limit to infinity and get as many transactions as possible in there.
00:42:40.275 - 00:44:18.603, Speaker A: And I'll mention one more thing and that's like we're currently trying to formalize a mission vision purpose for the dao which would then lead into another proposal which we're calling the Strategic Objective Setting Framework, which would basically allow anyone in the DAO to propose one to two year goals for the dao, like interim goals that would push the DAO towards its mission vision purpose. So trying to like kind of get everybody on the same page and big shout out to lido because they kind of came up with this structure and we've just like kind of taken that and formulated it into a format that we think suits arbitrary pretty well. Like Lio Drus Brigus. Yeah, exactly. Or it was originally called Goose. And then because of the not LST but risk taking narrative started like they had to kind of, yeah, refocus or re goose their like strategic objectives, which is why hasu posted the Rygoos proposal. But that ecosystem is also interesting or that project because Hasu is like of course really well respected, really like smart guy and he has the ability to like kind of direct the whole DAO with what he's saying while in Arbitrum, like you got a spectrum, you have like the builders on one side and then I guess what would be the other side? Kind of the investors who ever.
00:44:18.603 - 00:45:04.855, Speaker A: And then like the builders right now kind of want to grow the ecosystem as fast as possible, don't care about like profitability and then do that stuff later while then like the investor side is more. I feel like let's take it easier. I don't know, maybe they're trying to save their unlocks or save some juice for their unlocks in the next few years. But yeah, arbitrary is a super, super interesting ecosystem because you have such a wide range of different actors and it's a good and a bad thing at the same time. Right. You get a lot of different ideas, but then sometimes like consolidating everything and getting everyone on like an equal page can be pretty challenging.
00:45:05.435 - 00:45:20.375, Speaker C: I have a bunch of questions about this, but before that I want to ask Jose. When you guys invest, do you do any activist investing or do you get involved in dials or are you mostly trying to stay out of it as much as possible and just let your analysis do the work?
00:45:21.505 - 00:45:53.619, Speaker D: I share the analysis on Twitter. So like not really the activist investing in terms of like making the dao makes it make changes either on management or on turning on fee switch. It's mostly like sharing the thesis on Twitter, making people realize through coverage that something may be undervalued or that there is a good growth story there for a specific protocol in a vertical or whatever. But not really like, yeah, like making it. Making them turning on the fear switch order. Yeah.
00:45:53.707 - 00:46:26.665, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. Brick, I have two questions, but I think the first one you're going to yap about a lot, so I'm going to ask that one later. In terms of actors and dealing with them, what's been like the toughest thing? And I actually want to have Sam and Matt on from Entropy as well. Blockworks might get upset with me at some point about this, but I really want because like governance is something that like I don't do. We have a governance arm, but I don't do any governance stuff. So I like. Is it annoying to deal with people especially, I assume with delegates and protocols? There's a lot of conflicts of interest.
00:46:26.665 - 00:46:30.105, Speaker C: You can stay diplomatic, but what's your experience?
00:46:31.045 - 00:47:22.955, Speaker A: Thanks for giving me that permission. I mean, I think it's just an interesting set of actors you get to, like, be with. And it's super, like, it's been a super, like, thoughtful pro. Not thoughtful. What's the correct word I'm looking for here? Like, I've learned a lot from that process, basically, because, like, you need to be able to kind of put yourself in many people's shoes. And at the end of the day, like, yeah, I mean, Entropy has a delegation as well, but we're, like, trying to stay or especially when we're working on something that's going to be implemented into the dao, we want to stay neutral and just take everybody's opinion into account, which can be quite hard sometimes. But it's been a great way to basically learn how to communicate within the crypto industry.
00:47:22.955 - 00:47:33.015, Speaker A: And, yeah, I've always been more of a valuations guy, so this has definitely made my whole skill set more robust, if that makes sense.
00:47:33.465 - 00:48:02.425, Speaker C: That makes sense. I think my last thing is. And Jose, I also want you to bring in your uni chain discussion in here. How will Arbitrum, or how do you see Arbitrum positioning itself? Because L2S. I mean, base is dominating, optimism, has pretty good BD, which is apparently just giving out $45 million to chains to come on. But, like, how do you see Arbitrum? And Jose, I guess, how do you see. Do you see Unicain being a competitor to Arbitrary, or is it just we're all growing Ethereum?
00:48:03.485 - 00:48:43.899, Speaker A: Well, maybe I'll start by talking about the Arbitrim stuff. And I mean, that's kind of the. Through the mission vision purpose proposal we've made. That's one of the key things we've laid out that at the end of the day, Arbitrum is trying to just scale Ethereum without compromise. And I know this is kind of something that a lot of people get like, dunked on on Twitter for saying, like, oh, we're just scaling here. And then somebody else comes and says, like, yeah, but you're taking the execution fees away from the L1. That turns out to.
00:48:43.899 - 00:49:26.579, Speaker A: Into another, like, fully or different conversation. But at the end of the day, that's also how I see it. Like, we're just, like, trying to scale the L1. And I know it can lead into some, like, fees being missed out on, basically, but I think the model there, or we're kind of working towards makes sense, at least in my mind. What makes Arbitrum different? I'd say The DAO is probably. Or like arguably, I know you could argue about this, but I think the DAO is like probably the best across, like objectively the best across L2s. So like you get a lot of support on that front.
00:49:26.579 - 00:50:18.509, Speaker A: The foundation is super good. But then also like the Arbitrum's readiness to kind of attract financial actors, like real tradfi actors, in my opinion sets it apart. Like that's like the main differentiator between other L2s. Like I really like Solanas, whatever the slogan is, like become the on chain, Nasdaq or something like that. And I see like Arbitrum kinda going in that similar direction where I could see those two kind of competing around that stuff. And we've actually onboarded a lot of RWA providers as well recently, like real institutions. So like I guess that's also where I think the future is going for Arbitrum.
00:50:18.509 - 00:50:47.595, Speaker A: And as you said, optimism seems to have good bd. But at least I'm not super familiar what they're doing in the background, but at least from what I've read on the Internet, it's them giving out tokens. While Arbitrum has been at least somewhat organically able to get these notable names in the ecosystem. Sorry, that was a complete yapping sesh.
00:50:49.655 - 00:51:20.295, Speaker D: We're all growing Ethereum. No OP versus arbitrary. We're all growing Ethereum, man. Yeah. My summary of my thoughts on Unichain. So I think it's two first, it's quite difficult to quantify Unichain's impact because it will be very dependent on the amount of TBL and volume that moves there. Having said that, probably like just after launch, which should probably happen this month, in a few weeks at least they will have 200 mil daily out volume.
00:51:20.295 - 00:52:21.633, Speaker D: This 200 mil is basically what Unisop X currently has. They control that so they can just quickly plug it on and say oh you permission. Market makers are going to start solving on Unichain rather than having your liquidity on these layer 2s and because they control that order flow. So that's one second rather than being zero sum or PvP versus eth mainnet or other layer 2s such as Arbitrum. I really think that their implicit strategy is like going after Solana and more if you want to be more crazy or more bullish is going after thexis traction. So my framework is that Uniswap wants to compete with this min coin offering by offering like better UX via MAV protection, lower latency, lower similar latency to Solana and thus attract Mincoin issuance to happen on Unichain rather than on Solana. Because the most important thing here is like where these assets are being issued, right? And few reasons why.
00:52:21.633 - 00:52:58.775, Speaker D: I think this is first their Unichain flash blocks which reduce the sandwich possibilities and improve the UX of trading min coins. If you guys obviously like traded on Solana, you have to pay like 15 slippage or priority fees to get into a radium buy. That sucks. I mean it's fine because you're, you're, you got, I mean you're searching for a 2x, a 3x so you kind of don't care, but over time it kind of sucks. So on, on Unichain that doesn't have to happen. That's the first thing. Secondly, there is this project called Doppler.
00:52:58.775 - 00:53:34.815, Speaker D: It's being led by Austin Adams. Not Hayden, but Austin, he's like another developer that used to work for Uniswap and now he's, he's still an advisor in Uniswap but now he has his own mechanism design firm. But yeah, anyway, like Doppler is, is just a better palm fund. It improves the price discovery phase during the mink launch. So you don't get snipes and you don't get, you actually like get for launches. And it's built as a hook on unfortunately. So there's like these two things that @ the very least should attract some percentage of the Solanamin conditions to happen on Unichain.
00:53:34.815 - 00:54:14.937, Speaker D: And that's generally the thesis. And yeah, obviously they have also a lot of catalysts ahead, but in terms of their implicit study, I think that's pretty much it. And also maybe a little bit more abstract is like unifying Ethereum through their front ends. So once Uniswap X Crossing future goes live, you'll probably just go on the front end and say, oh, I want to buy bread on base and I have eth on this chain and you can do crossing swaps without even knowing which chain your assets are living on. But yeah, that's more into the future. Probably end of the year or January.
00:54:15.121 - 00:54:45.569, Speaker A: I guess something that somewhat might tie together on like a higher level. Unichain and then Arbitrum is like the uniqueness of the tech stack in a way. Like, you know, Arbitrum has stylus. You can basically code in. Well, I don't want to say whatever language, but it expands on that. You got time boost like you're pretty much one of the L2s. That's like furthest on the decentralized spectrum or whatever L2 is calling.
00:54:45.569 - 00:54:58.795, Speaker A: If you've seen the pie chart thingy and different levels of like L2 and then unichen has the. I forget the right name for it, but what was it that was built with flashbots again?
00:54:59.375 - 00:55:09.999, Speaker D: The flash blocks or the uni validator set or. I think there's another name for what you're saying. But yeah, yeah, I get what you're referring to.
00:55:10.167 - 00:55:13.155, Speaker C: Brian, do you have any hot takes about unichain versus arbitrary?
00:55:13.865 - 00:55:24.725, Speaker E: I mean I think it's clearly a competition. Maybe not today best case scenario. But yeah, that's. That's my hottest take.
00:55:25.665 - 00:55:26.857, Speaker C: Yeah, I tend to agree.
00:55:26.961 - 00:55:29.205, Speaker A: I'd say that that was a boring thing.
00:55:31.985 - 00:55:54.075, Speaker E: I think they'll be more challenged than people think. And starting up their own chain, like going to an island and starting your own thing is always really, really hard. They do have the brand to maybe overcome that. So I think if anyone can do it, it's probably Uniswap. But it's not going to be easy.
00:55:54.535 - 00:56:41.195, Speaker A: I do agree with. At the end of the day everyone's competing for users capital whatever I guess still L2 is built on utilizing Ethereum still in my mind like scales theorem itself. But it's true that L2 is probably can be seen as really competing against each other and of course the interop will get better and better and better. But I think maybe in the near term what's going to happen is I know CKSync has these chain clusters Optimism has the super Chain standard and like Arbitrum is working on a similar perfect.
00:56:41.235 - 00:56:51.659, Speaker D: It was called Chain, I think it's called Arbitrum Orbit. It's the Same cluster as OP super chain, as Polygon CDK, as elastic chain of CKSync. Yeah, all of those.
00:56:51.827 - 00:57:21.169, Speaker A: Yeah. Well Orbit is just like the development or like you can have an L2 or an L3 that's an orbit chain but I think they call it chain clusters or something. Nah. Well, anyway, you get what I'm saying. You basically have these hubs where within for example Arbitrum you can easily move between chains. But then it might be a bit more difficult to go from the Arbitrum ecosystem for example to CK Sync. That makes sense.
00:57:21.337 - 00:58:18.803, Speaker D: That's why I'm so bullish on a cross. This is like a very brief pieces but it's so the ERC that I was saying before 7, 6, 8, 3 it's basically like this unifying glue of all of those L2 existing clusters that you set. So when you have like a user that wants to bridge from between OP super chains from base to op. You will be using that ERC to get like instant almost feeling atomically transaction. And then the solver behind the scenes they can settle through the layer 2 ecosystem cluster specific native drop. So in terms of user experience it probably is like cheaper when they reach from OP to OP super chain. And if the user wants to bridge like from an ecosystem cluster from optimism to arbitrum, it also provides that same level experience, maybe a little bit more expensive because they select different clusters.
00:58:18.803 - 00:58:33.835, Speaker D: But again like from the user experience it's just a matter of different fees and this across architecture. And this ERC is basically like this unifying glue of all of Ethereum. That's why it's also endorsed by Vitalik. And yeah, I think it's pretty cool.
00:58:34.175 - 00:58:44.787, Speaker C: I will say other like I love intense. Like before I got butt fucked by Maka. I did. I. I was like I love intense. I do. Because I remember bridging over.
00:58:44.787 - 00:59:16.545, Speaker C: I say this every two pods. Ryan's probably sick of hearing this. But like before I remember bridging using wormhole to Solana and it's like you got to go on the discord and say please can I have my money back? And now E bridges just the easiest thing. And so is the cross consistently cheap, consistently quick. I don't know. I'm very happy. So I agree with that Feast Salah, if there is going to be some goofy multi chain world and we're not all on Solana, which is Brick's nightmare, probably that that's the block works we.
00:59:16.545 - 00:59:25.665, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's it. Ryan, do you have anything else you want to say or shall I wrap it up?
00:59:26.645 - 00:59:29.905, Speaker E: I'm good. Guys, this is a lot of fun. Should do it again.
00:59:31.085 - 00:59:42.479, Speaker C: We should. Brick, Jose, thanks for coming on. Do you guys want to give out your Twitters? And Brick, maybe you can give out the entropy Twitter as well so that people are listeners.
00:59:42.527 - 00:59:56.115, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I'm ox. Underscore, underscore, underscore. Brick on Twitter. Yes, I need to change that. And you can find entropy advisors on Twitter. Just Entropy advisors.
00:59:56.695 - 00:59:58.303, Speaker C: Fantastic. Jose, what about you?
00:59:58.399 - 01:00:07.085, Speaker D: And for myself I'm Tumilad as it sounds. And just another T at the end. So two millet and another T. Pretty easy.
01:00:08.345 - 01:00:11.245, Speaker C: Fantastic. Yeah. Guys, thanks for coming on. This was a lot of fun.
01:00:12.305 - 01:00:13.145, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
