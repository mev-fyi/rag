00:00:00.200 - 00:00:23.774, Speaker A: I think you could argue, well, I mean, some people are basically painting this scenario where restaking will create this massive kind of extra yield coming in for validators when I don't really see it at all. I think it's actually very hard to come up with useful things that validator can do that would be widely accepted and create so much value that they have an impact on the yield of such a big network.

00:02:15.934 - 00:02:21.110, Speaker D: We're good, thank you. We are like, it's nice spring weather out there.
00:02:21.142 - 00:02:28.034, Speaker A: So yeah, agree. Can't wait to get back outside. And by the way, I'm a big fan of the podcast.
00:02:28.694 - 00:02:40.634, Speaker C: Happy to hear. I'm a big fan of uncommon core. So likewise, before we get started, do you guys want to give an overview of like, what Eve issuance is, how it works, and what are some concerns surrounding it recently?
00:02:41.854 - 00:03:53.154, Speaker D: Okay, I can start with this, like, so since the merge happened, the only source of other issuance is in form of staking rewards on beacon chain. So when other stakers take the ether and the not operator runs a node and they provide the services to service to the ideal network, they attest the blocks and they propose the blocks. They can provide some information on slashings happening and they get a reward for it. This reward is like pretty small. Other issuance is pretty low right now. If you frequent crypto Twitter, you might have seen the ultrasound memes, but the gist is pretty low. Issuance rate at this point lower the bitcoin lower than most other crypto tokens that have proof of stake of proof of work mechanics.
00:03:53.154 - 00:04:04.914, Speaker D: That is basically the only source of new ether coming in the system right now.
00:04:06.294 - 00:04:18.656, Speaker C: Perfect. How has because staked eth dynamics have changed quite significantly since the emerge. How does that affect issuance? What are some implications that it has on the issuance curve?
00:04:18.800 - 00:05:33.934, Speaker D: I don't think that staking dynamics has changed significantly. Like the dynamics are more or less like the stake growth continues, it kind of slows down sometimes, then picks up at times depending on the, a lot of things, honestly, the current state of the market, the additional source of rewards on your stake, etcetera, etcetera, and it just slowly creeps up. Currently it's about slightly less than 30% of other stake and it continues to grow slowly. The current right now drivers of stake growth are, you can see it in the dashboard. There are a lot of them. Most of it for quite a few months right now is risk taking driven people from the points and add routes for future risk taking protocol and current risk taking protocol protocols. And most of the stake that's coming in right now is like focused on restaking.
00:05:33.934 - 00:06:16.764, Speaker D: I think there is still some demand that is like most unchanged coming from people who just want to stake. And I think the rest taking demand will go down a bit and just plain stake can go up a bit with the, when they're like they're slowly creeping up the amount of other institutional stake institutions also probably mostly select the boring and safe ways to stake.
00:06:18.064 - 00:06:51.784, Speaker E: Got it. I'm curious, so you mentioned ETH currently has, I think, a little less than 30% stake rate at the moment. And you mentioned you think restaking has been a huge driver and that number ticking up currently. I'm curious going from here, as you look at other proof of stake networks like Solana I think has over 85% stake rate Cosmos over 60%. Do you think Ethereum eventually gets to that end state? And I guess if so, if you see the stake rate of ETh growing, what do you think is going to be the main drivers of those going forward?
00:06:54.764 - 00:08:02.030, Speaker D: Yeah, so this is a very packed question. Ethereum is on one hand in general, what are the end games for staking? There are I think at least two, maybe more. This is where any networks can end up in regards to staking and there is also like path dependence of some kind. Ethereum is unlike every other proof of stake network in the fact that how it came to be a proof of stake network. Basically I'll start with the second part. Either was mostly distributed when proof of stake came into beam, when bitcoin chain launched, and then when merge happened, most of feder was already distributed, almost all of it, and it had been for years. So unlike most proof of stake networks of late, that launch with stake enabled and there is basically nothing to do with the token.
00:08:02.030 - 00:08:48.604, Speaker D: But stake AdA is very different. It's super financialized, there are a lot of economy built around ETA. It's a great collateral, it's great unit of account, it's great like something that store of value is something that you can just hold for a time. And there also was a lot of risk coming with staking in the first years. Basically we didn't know when the unstaking would be possible, if proof of stake would like. It was almost sure that proof of stake would happen and continue to happen forever. But there were people who were saying proof of work is the best and this is a fat and this will be rolled back.
00:08:48.604 - 00:09:47.884, Speaker D: So it started at almost 0% of either stake and then it slowly grew up to current 27. And speed of growth is like, it's not super fast. This is also in part due to technical limitations. The deposit queue can become long and prevent people for staking when they don't want the other to be stuck for two months doing nothing. So this is unlike networks like Solana or Cosmos or Tezos or any other, that when they launch you can basically transfer and stake. And there are two things that you can do in a dydhog or another. You could have done a lot of things before you could stake, and they were in competition for a long time.
00:09:47.884 - 00:10:35.564, Speaker D: Yeah, and in terms of endgame, my personal theory here is like basically you can select many directions as a community. Like can select many directions and there are like trade offs between them. For example, there is a pretty, like most of the staking network, they select as an end game the state where most of token is staked. This has its benefits that it's a pretty stroking game for staking. A pretty strong state. It's an equilibrium. So like when it's 60% stake, it stay that way.
00:10:35.564 - 00:11:29.032, Speaker D: Unless the network will change a lot. And it makes sure that the people who do the UGIs, that they have to do when stake, like for example, proposed blocks, maintain validators, maintain network weakness and safety. They are mostly super aligned with your token holders. They are the same people. When they merger intersection, you can just kinda try the understanding. Then when the stakers do something to screw up the network, they do something to screw up the holdings, basically. And these people intersect.
00:11:29.032 - 00:12:36.634, Speaker D: So a lot of security improvements takes comes not from the staking mechanism and not from Solana. Doesn't have slashing for example, overlanch. But these networks are pretty secure in practice and have been running for a long time without non technical issues, basically. But from the fact that your stakers, your blog producers, your validators, your network participants are aligned with the token holders. This works for a network in a good way. And then there is like endgame that Caspar and Anders from the foundation and some other folks are proposing. That is basically a minority of either becoming in stake with the understanding that stakers are services provider to the larger community of other holders.
00:12:36.634 - 00:13:09.054, Speaker D: And other holders are the primary. They are bigger and larger and more powerful than stakers. And stakers are just like a subset of them. That is pretty small and pretty weak in political sense. I don't think that anyone has actually tried that. I can't remember a network that works like that, honestly. I think it's also a setup that makes sense in some way.
00:13:09.054 - 00:14:16.390, Speaker D: But I think that it makes. When you separate and pit against each other, holders and stakers, you get a not very stable situation unless they are constantly politically interlocked and clash all the time. Because imagine a most extreme case of this, for example, 0.1% of at the stake. If that happens, then most block producers and ad testers are the most revenue they get is from MEV in this case. And that means they're like very motivated to extract their MEV revenue and very unmotivated to work with the network. On network's goals at 25%, it's not as pronounced, but it's more pronounced than that.
00:14:16.390 - 00:14:36.004, Speaker D: At 60%, this is a spectrum. At large percent staked, you mostly have stakers and holders aligned a lot. And at low percent, you mostly have them pitted against each other. So, yeah, that's how I see it.
00:14:39.224 - 00:15:20.324, Speaker A: I mean, there's very little, actually, to add. I think this was a very good explanation, Vasily. I think one thing that I'd highlight is between the two scenarios, you're kind of choosing, let me put it a different way. There's multiple frameworks to look through on this problem, and one is it's a kind of choose your principal agent problem that you prefer. So in the one case where you have very little stake, then you basically have the agents, the stakers doing something on behalf of, you know, the principal, which is the e folders. And the overlap between the two is very small. And so the principal agent problem is very strong.
00:15:20.324 - 00:16:39.434, Speaker A: But on the other side, you may have a principle agent problem when there's a lot staked, for example, between the biggest liquid staking provider and the ether holders, or kind of the network at large. Right. So you basically get like different forms of delegation and different ways to constrain them. And I think it's been generally my view that the principal agent problem between a decentralized staking protocol and stakers is more manageable to investment in decentralization and decentralized governance and so on, then in the kind of the low percentage staked world. And the second, I think, and really just kind of to restate what Vasily said, is this idea of competition. So if you kind of model this very extreme scenario, then the competition and the competitive pressure for the different validators is super high. And what this means is either they, as Vasili was saying, they compete, for example, on extracting malicious forms of mev that are basically currently like out of bounds for operators.
00:16:39.434 - 00:17:29.062, Speaker A: Or even more simply, you just compete on price. You might say, who's the cheapest provider of staking? It's always someone who runs all the validators on a single centralized machine, aka Coinbase. And so you can say, hey, we want 1%. If you want 1% of, of ethereum state, then I can give you a near 100% guarantee that the only party staking will be coinbase. And so that has implications on the network in terms of alignment, again, between these parties. It has implications on the regulatory fragility of the network around censorship, resistance and so on. And so I would definitely agree.
00:17:29.062 - 00:17:54.528, Speaker A: There's like, no, you know, there's no easy answers here, but I think this idea of just kind of, you know, taking these extreme, these ideas to their kind of logical conclusions by, you know, just like really kind of tuning up the lever and like, you know, making kind of a very extreme version of it, I think you can see what they are trending towards.

00:20:19.156 - 00:20:46.494, Speaker C: Before we get to talking a bit more about the issuance, I kind of wanted to ask a question about Coinbase ETH as well as and how it relates to Lido, as far as I understand. Like what are the biggest frictions for? As far as I understand, there's kind of this institutional demand for Coinbase staking through Coinbase, and I'm kind of wondering what are the big frictions for Lido and like serving staked ETH to institutions.
00:20:48.874 - 00:22:00.034, Speaker D: I'm not the person point for this for Lidar, so this is a bit secondhand account here, but my understanding here is for constitutions are different. But when we are not talking about gen institutions basically, that are like slowly more conservative ones that are slowly tricking out in crypto, in bitcoin, ethereum, etc. Etcetera, they are pretty conservative. So the main goal is not to earn more, but to screw up less, basically. So it's mostly about safety from technical perspective, from regulatory perspective, for market perspective, etc. Etcetera. So they want, when they have an asset, they want it to be liquid, they want it to be safe, and they want it to be regulatory safe as well.
00:22:00.034 - 00:23:14.016, Speaker D: That makes work to present at a stake into institutions like multiplance approach. When you need to make your product safe, you need to make your product or your protocol. Or if we're talking about Liddell shave and you need to figure out the regulatory site, and you need to figure out the informational security stuff like that. And you need to explain it to people who might be using your product protocol. So these are the challenges. Some players, like Coinbase have a leg up on this because they have the muscle to do it and they have a huge holodecks of people who they can explain the product to and stuff like that. But there is always something you can do to differentiate.
00:23:14.016 - 00:23:37.004, Speaker D: Like for example, Coinbase has charges huge fees. So that's basically like three pillars of institutional great product is safety, liquidity and regulatory clearance. That's three things that have to happen.
00:23:40.384 - 00:24:00.194, Speaker C: Perfect. Maybe this one is a bit more directed to Hasu, but how do you feel eth ETF's will? Or if they come, how do you think they'll change the dynamics of ETH staking? Or just in general, like how Ethereum is, let's say, over the next couple of years.
00:24:02.094 - 00:24:27.464, Speaker A: Yeah. I've been under the impression that in general, ets would have a pretty big impact on staking. I think ETF buyers in general are very indiscriminate buyers. They don't really care how much yield there is. I think they just want the ETH to be staked. And so it doesn't matter really how high the yield is. I think they will stake it.
00:24:27.464 - 00:25:06.858, Speaker A: I think also in the past people used to think there will be Eth ETF's and staked Eth ETF's. I don't believe that to be the case at all. I think there will only be ETF's and they will stake, period. Why? Because ETF's compete amongst themselves on the total expense ratio. And I mean, even for physically backed ETF's, you can see that they are effectively lending out also as much of their assets as possible to kind of generate some extra yield on them. So this type of re hypothecation inside ETF's is kind of very normal.
00:25:06.906 - 00:25:07.114, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:07.154 - 00:26:30.196, Speaker A: And so I think you will see this, you know, a lot of stake coming in from ETF's. And I think what's very important to ask is like, what kind of provider will these ETF's use? Right. So in many ways, ETF is kind of the most regulated entity you can have next to maybe an endowment. And then it's basically definitely not this kind of degen institution that vasily was talking about. But it's more the kind of ultra conservative one where they do want the yield, but they also have to take extreme precautions to make it safe and liquid and especially very regulatorily compliant. And that's why I think that ETF's are a very big threat to Ethereum in that sense, because it's basically the promise of a lot of stake coming in and that stake selecting almost the most conservative provider it can, I think, basically shake up what the staking landscape looks like. And this is a big motivation why last year we created this, the goals for Lido Dow strategy proposal that was ratified.
00:26:30.196 - 00:26:59.114, Speaker A: And a big part of that was to focus on this institutional opportunity because we thought that there is a significant amount of money lined up to come to ETF's. And also if no decentralized staking pool gets into the position to serve this market and kind of also fights for first place here, then it's basically guaranteed to go to one of the centralized, highly regulated providers.
00:27:02.934 - 00:27:48.304, Speaker E: Got it? Yeah, I think that makes sense and definitely want to bring this sort of back to the issuance conversation because it definitely plays in where having an ETF, assuming that these providers are all going to stake their ethnicity, that's going to be a huge driver for the percentage of stake deep on the network. And we already talked about sort of the pros and cons of having a high stake rate or a low stake rate, etcetera. And we did see a big proposal from Ansgaard and Casper regarding changing the issuance curve to address potential concerns with the high stake rates. I'm wondering if you guys could give an overview ENSr's high level thoughts on their proposal to change the issuance curve.
00:27:52.084 - 00:28:56.354, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'm happy to take a first step. So at this point there have been multiple proposals. I think it started actually with one from Anders that was called minimum viable issuance MVI. And I think that was more about how can you have a mechanism that basically says we want this amount of ETH stakes minimum, but also not really go beyond that and have more than that. And it also had some good discussion of, okay, so what is too low? Like at what point do you get really like very destructive effects on the network? But it was more around like attestation games, et cetera. It was not focused on what is the quality of the node operator set, which is more what we are interested in, I would say. So then the proposal from Casper and Ensca, this one I think is explicitly proposed, designing the curve in such a way that it would effectively kept the stake rate at 25%.
00:28:56.354 - 00:29:56.954, Speaker A: And I believe they brought three arguments for that. One is kind of the more technical one, saying like more you've staked means more validators, means higher network overhead. Then there's one that's around. Okay, so we are overspending on security. Is the network at 50% staked really more secure than at 25? And if no, then you may be able to save that amount of issuance and basically return it to the token holders. And the third one was that if you let a lot of ETH be staked, then you create the environment where a liquid staking token like staked Eve can basically unfold a lot of network effect and get a high share and that would crowd out ETH as the trustless base token. So I think this is kind of the rough summary of what they proposed and.
00:29:56.954 - 00:30:01.434, Speaker A: Yeah. And the motivation for it.
00:30:02.264 - 00:30:51.764, Speaker D: Yeah, I like, it's been like a long series of thought posts and proposals and analysis from multiple people. They have different proposals, they have different opinions on why they need to happen, why they don't need to happen. But the hassle of life. Most of them, it's spending less, it's limiting the amount of other mistake and limiting amount of validators in the network. I think that like the technical side, the amount of validators in network is kind like. It's mostly going to be alleviated by Max D proposal that's going even Pectra. So it's like a secondary argument here.
00:30:51.764 - 00:31:55.634, Speaker D: The most important ones are like limiting the impact of stakers. Like making stakers a small part of instead of majority of other holders and paying less for security. I think that it sudden explode. I'm not convinced that small amount of head on stake is a better endgame than high amount of ethernet stake. I think there are a lot of benefits from having stakers and work producers and attesters to be the same people as token holders. Mostly it's the ultimate alignment basically here. And I think that we should explore more what would happen with Wade dataset.
00:31:55.634 - 00:32:32.912, Speaker D: So imagine there is at 25%. It's ten times more centralized. Is it good or not? This is big question here. And this can happen because with the economic mechanism of limiting the amount of stakeholder like you're using issuance to limit their model stake. Basically there are actors that can afford the cheapest kind of not operation or have additional source of revenue. That means that they have additional business on top of staking. Like for example an exchange has additional.
00:32:32.912 - 00:32:55.386, Speaker D: They get money from fees and they also get from staking fees. And they also get money from trading. They can even have like staking fees to bond. Negative. If people who are in a chain trade a lot. Because like they can have a vertical integration here. Similar things with like ETF.
00:32:55.386 - 00:33:35.824, Speaker D: They have their fees on top of like as a deposit. So like they can stake cheaper, right? Take less fee on staking, just taking or such vertical integration as risk taking. So like if you can put more revenue streams on your stake data, you are in a better position to be successful in extremely limited market. It's basically changing the current market. That is like growing market. And everyone wants to be the best product in the growing market to the limited market where competition is the. The harshest and efficient thing.
00:33:35.824 - 00:35:06.636, Speaker D: And if the competition is mostly on price, it's going to end up in centralization. There is one kind of great example that is for me probably the emotionally hardest part of this. In the latest proposal they say that like we will not get more slow stickers than we have now that there are solo stakers, they will not go away because they are super committed and they will not like, there will be no more of them because they are not coming because they don't have enough stake or they stopped coming mostly. And this is a bit weird for me because we spent the team and Lidos working for online as well, has spent almost a year now building a great product for people who want to solve stake. It's going to be the pretty low bond, lower than 32 Ad, which is the main thing that's stopping people from participating in consensus right now. It's going to get them great ability to solve a stake. We have a strategy to reach out community to attract people to stake.
00:35:06.636 - 00:36:06.554, Speaker D: And if it's all getting striked out because the staking rewards are going to be reduced fourfold, for example, this product is non viable. The thing that ideal community wants is going to be like the product that makes solar sticking more approachable and usable and like better, allows more people to do it and provides better incentives to them is going to become less viable. So this is a bit great. And we are working on making people able to more people to able to solve stake. And there are going to be more of them if you don't make life worse for them. Basically.
00:36:08.854 - 00:36:25.394, Speaker C: Perfect. On the topic of solo stakers, I kind of want to hear you guys and what you think about how valuable solo staking is. Like, is this something that, I mean, you guys are working on it to optimize it, but is this something that is very important to optimize for?
00:36:25.974 - 00:37:23.752, Speaker A: In my opinion, it's very important to optimize for. I think one of Ethereum's biggest or most important properties is censorship resistance. And censorship resistance is basically a result of kind of the heterogeneity of the Valdada set today, kind of the layers that sit on top of it. So you can argue, okay, maybe the kind of diversity of the validators is not so important anymore. Now that we have PBS, you have relays in the mix, and you have blockbusters and you have maybe other intermediaries, but I think the opposite is true. So I think, you see solo stakers are less profit driven, more ideology driven, at the limit. And so they may make validation decisions that don't just follow.
00:37:23.752 - 00:38:56.112, Speaker A: Okay, so what is the most profitable thing to do, which is subscribe to the top three relays and the top three blockbusters, let's say. And maybe 80% of those are censoring transactions right now. They can also use different configurations in Mevboost, like Minbit where they build more blocks locally. And I think what many people forget is that we will also, I think, increasingly get a paradigm in Ethereum where we start reintroducing the preferences of validators into the higher layers. So I'm talking about things like partial block bidding and inclusion lists, where, for example, a proposer can forward a list of transactions that they want included in, let's say, the next block, and then that is basically sent to the relay and the block builder as almost like a blueprint, right? So, you know, I have to include those transactions, otherwise I can't even participate in the option. And so there are ways like that, how the kind of very useful, heterogeneous preferences of Valders can positively influence all of the layers around them. And I think if we want to keep Ethereum censorship, resistance, even in kind of the face of more institutional capital coming in, then it's very important that there's kind of this core of solo stakers to keep the protocol safe.
00:38:56.308 - 00:39:07.644, Speaker C: Perfect. And I kind of wanted to also ask, what is the Solido's building a solution? Or let's say it's optimizing for solo stakers. Could you kind of talk a bit more about that?
00:39:09.824 - 00:39:49.112, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay. Again, I'm like, not the best final point for this. It's led my Dmitry from community staking module team. I'll start by high level. Lido has a staking module thing going on, which is basically when stake comes into Lido, it can get distributed into multiple buckets. For staking, we used to have one bucket, the curated module, which had a pretty low number of professional operators.
00:39:49.112 - 00:40:50.808, Speaker D: Like right now, it's a bit over 30, I think. We recently launched a second module, simple DVT module, where a lot of operators are collaborating on DVT infrastructure, like many not operators running the same valid data together, which in increase lameness and reduce the chance of malicious takeover of validator. And CSM is supposed to be the third bucket here. Third module. So when stake comes into lido, it can get into a curated model or simple DVT, or when csms leave into CSM module. The module itself is pretty simple. It's permissionless.
00:40:50.808 - 00:42:01.004, Speaker D: Anyone can post a blonde into this module and get stake distributed to them. The bond number is pretty small, and Lido has a lot of stake. It can pour onto this module. It will probably start slow at first because that's how we approach the state distribution. We don't make sudden movements here, we slowly redistribute it, just like with the simple DVT, which started as intense mode and slowly getting mosfet. Right now the same would probably happen to Cs seven and that basically the digital it we are reaching out to many people who are making the interfaces for stakers like Dubload and nice cloud and other folks, and to communities to bring more people into this module. So that's the risk of it.
00:42:01.004 - 00:42:12.804, Speaker D: I think it's mostly like the code is mostly done, it's going into audits file and then testnet, then in deployment.
00:42:16.464 - 00:42:50.964, Speaker E: Awesome. One more thing I wanted to get your guys thoughts on regarding the issuance proposal was with respect to like ETH's moneyness. So one of the things they brought up was this idea that if you have a high stake rate, there's less liquidity for basically natural ETH as opposed to liquid staking derivatives. I'm curious, one, is that a concern like the liquidity of native ETH and two is like steeth in light of trying to compete on the money ness with ETH itself.
00:42:52.984 - 00:44:03.696, Speaker A: I basically think it's not a concern. Why? Because the kind of unencumbered ETH will disappear anyway. What is even a roll up that is also effectively sitting in a bridge, in many cases secured by a governance that can be upgraded as a smart contract that can be upgraded by governance. So, and in almost all, if not all cases, I think they have like even less, you know, safeguards than the light smart contracts have today, you know, and you know, we are working towards dual governance, which is a way to give stakers the ability to veto any changes that are being made to the smart contract. We also have a security council that can basically shut down staking. Maybe the city can say more about that. But so we have different kind of safeguards, either already live or in the works, that kind of make the negative upgrading of the smart contract very, very difficult.
00:44:03.696 - 00:44:58.314, Speaker A: And so we all know Ethereum has this roll up centric roadmap. On the one hand, more and more ETH is going on rollups because more and more of the activities moving there. But also you have effects like the ETF. ETF's coming online and so you will get more also funds sitting in decentralized custodians. So the end result is, one way or another, the unencumbered evil disappear and it will be replaced by different forms of, of encumbered ETH. And what really matters is kind of the security properties that this ETH has. And so I think you need to like look a bit more close and kind of evaluate the different ways where the ETH is actually sitting and I think there's a, you can do a lot worse than if sitting in Lido.
00:45:01.834 - 00:45:54.484, Speaker D: I honestly don't see the argument of reducing the money ness of either, because like it's staked. You could sort of make this argument like, I don't think it's also hold, but like does Dai, for example, reduce the moneyness of dollar? I don't think so. But even that, like, I think this is frankly like the other way around. Dollar denominator assets increase the acceptance of dollar like as a money. But even if you assume that it does, it's also a pretty different thing. Because staked at and is an aggregate state of ETA, it's not a synthetic thing, it's just ether that it is staked. If it's used as money, then it means that ether is used as money.
00:45:54.484 - 00:46:29.588, Speaker D: So I don't really understand it. It kinda, in some cases, like in some part dependence, et cetera, et cetera, it can lead to maybe liquidity, fragmentation of some sorts. But it probably looks like makes plain other is still better off here because it can be instantly converted to any of the aggregate forms, basically, but not necessarily vice versa. Right, I agree.
00:46:29.636 - 00:47:04.764, Speaker A: I mean, for me, Stackdeeth increases the money ness of ETH, because it makes it a yield bearing asset. I mean, way more people, for example, are holding treasury bits and would hold basically dollar cash, right? So I think just the ability of opt into the, the yield that you can get on ETH, this makes it a more attractive and more scalable, just better asset. Overall, I think a lot fewer people would be interested in holding ETH if staking was limited to a very small number of people.
00:47:07.984 - 00:47:23.984, Speaker C: Speaking of earning yield on your ETH, I kind of want to ask a few questions about restaking. First of all, how do you think restaking is going to impact the validator set in the long run? And also, how would it impact each issuance policy?
00:47:24.484 - 00:48:11.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I can maybe take a first step at this. So how will it impact the staking and the validator set in general? So I mean, for one, there's many forms of restaking. I think like some limited number of things actually requires you to have a validator. And so those things actually need to be done by the Ethereum validator set or by subsets of it and then others. It's just some type of economic commitment on the activity of some actor that doesn't have to be valid at all. And you also don't need to use ETH for that at all. So for example, you can restake dollars you saw the launch of the Eigen token, which I assume they will try to position as the superior form of collateral for restaking.
00:48:11.194 - 00:48:52.824, Speaker A: Because it's inter subjective, it can fork based on disputes. So they see that there's only like if you look at like the PI of all restaking, then only a small fraction of that is basically relevant for, in particular, I think for the Ethereum validators and for that subset there, I think you do see if use cases like that become attractive. And let's talk about for example, data availability. So is that actually, do you actually need the facility now if you need the Ethereum version for that?
00:48:54.444 - 00:48:55.384, Speaker D: Not really.
00:48:55.844 - 00:49:50.034, Speaker A: You don't, right? Yeah, I think even anyone can do this, but there are select few where you actually need it. So, preconfirmations. So this is a commitment to include a transaction in a future block that only a valid, I can give, nobody else can give this type of commitment, not even a block builder or relay, because they ultimately also only bid in the block option with the Valdada. And so yeah, if use cases like this become prevalent, then it's like Mev, it's like Mev boost that also started at 0% adoption and then it added more yield basically to staking. And it was seen as very ethereum aligned and very useful and good for the network to do it. And so eventually it became the new standard. And now when we talk about staking, we also talk about running MEP boost like it was never any different.
00:49:50.034 - 00:51:02.206, Speaker A: So I think reconfirmation can be the same thing. And in that case, what happens is just the definition of staking changes, and I think everybody else has to play along. And also kind of the yield of staking may go up and then the amount of stake will also go up until the new equilibrium is found where it's basically not more profitable for the marginal staker to join. So I think you could argue, well, I mean, some people are basically painting this scenario where restaking will create this massive kind of extra yield coming in for validators when I don't really see it at all. I think it's actually very hard to come up with useful things that validator can do that would be like widely accepted and create so much value that they have an impact on the yield of such a big network. And so in my view, restaking obviously is kind of very hot right now as a topic, but it's also driven by purely kind of unsustainable subsidies.
00:51:02.270 - 00:51:02.874, Speaker D: Right.
00:51:03.754 - 00:51:18.854, Speaker A: And so I think as for kind of how it affects staking, I think for the next few years, I don't really see that there will be, financially speaking, kind of a very big impact.
00:51:22.594 - 00:52:16.684, Speaker D: Yeah. So I have a bit of a different perspective on this, not in that like I disagree, but I'm like have a different mind map race more like this. So let's start by assuming that risk taking actually is as successful, or like nearly as successful as people presume it will be. So like it's not like let's assume it's not going to be a web aware. Basically, I think it's like it has chances for this because people want the other to have more revenue streams for the other. And when a lot of capital wants something to happen and this is technically feasible, it's probably going to happen. So it makes some sense.
00:52:16.684 - 00:53:33.964, Speaker D: And that means that for if and this is like there is a difference, like how it's going to play out depends on how the AVss and the validated services and staking providers, like alerts or not operators or like exchange, et cetera. But in general, if they force every node operator to run everything, basically. So if there are ten successful AVss and to be like a best node operator that provides best API, you have to run ten of them. It means that like this space is going to be super centralized. If you have to run a lot of software that is different and you have to excel at all of this. It's impossible to do this as all operation. You have to be a company, you have to be like 1530 people, something that works and shift and have maintain relationships and attract stake and do biggie, et cetera, et cetera.
00:53:33.964 - 00:54:52.204, Speaker D: Just how it is with not operators in different networks these days, who operates on a lot of networks? You can't run multi network operations on your laptop. What is possible even. It's hard to do at home when you just like run Ethereum nodes hard. I mean for most people, not for, for a majority of people, not for like just a taxi and rich in other. So yeah, the gist is if you have to be a successful not operator that has the best chances of tracking stake or just like walking in the black instead of in the red. If the if hems on theorem is going to get close to negative, right, it means that only professionals can do complex operations. The hardest taken is the more complex staking is, the more centralized it is.
00:54:52.204 - 00:55:56.544, Speaker D: This is a roll of thumb that never failed in proof tech networks. The simpler it is, the easier is to make it decentralized. The harder, the more complex, the more competitor it is, the harder it is. So if you don't have to be to run complex things to be in real data, like you delegated something or something, then it might mostly remain the same. There is also a question of implementation. Like for example, right now, it's not really easy or cheap to be a small operator in ankle because your costs are almost flat from the number of validators you have, and not insignificant. So when you run only one or two in gin layer, you have to pay a lot for each, and then you have thousand.
00:55:56.544 - 00:56:04.356, Speaker D: Your costs are flat, but your points are not. Right. Yeah.
00:56:04.380 - 00:56:07.024, Speaker A: You have fixed costs, large fixed costs in the beginning.
00:56:07.624 - 00:56:32.484, Speaker D: Yeah. The gas costs and operational costs. Yeah. So it's very dependent on how the things play out. The more complex it's going to be for to be a good operator, the worse it's going to be in terms of centralization.
00:56:34.904 - 00:56:49.464, Speaker C: Perfect. That makes sense. How is Lido getting involved in restaking? Or is it planning on getting involved in restaking? Or how do you guys view that sector in general is a better question.
00:56:49.504 - 00:58:19.264, Speaker A: I say, yeah. So when this episode airs, we will have, I will have put out proposal on the Lido forum to update the last guus set of goals, giving it kind of a bit of a fresh touch in the light of both of these topics of today, actually minimum viable issuance and what to do about restaking. And I think there's three takeaways for what I'm proposing, at least for the DAO. And one is that staked if should stay a liquid staking token and not become an LRT, in spite of the big hype that you're seeing right now, and the points that may be able to be farmed, et cetera. And I think it's for two reasons. One is that the big opportunity over the next years is institutional capital coming in that has very strict rules as kind of a city laid out in the beginning of the episode. And I think the kind of actively managed nature of selecting AVss and kind of additional rehypothecation steps makes it not very suitable if you're pursuing this group of users right now.
00:58:19.264 - 00:59:27.044, Speaker A: And the second one is that really LST is really a commoditized software service, and LRT is really more of a kind of actively managed mutual fund or like a tokenized share in an ethereum lending market or something where somebody has to constantly kind of make these risk assessment and capital allocation decisions. And so while one share of an LST is like every other share of an LST, and it kind of satisfies this big, I think like preference of many people for LRT. It's very different. You can have very different baskets of risk and you can have many different ones, and it's less likely that many people actually share the same preference. And so I think LRT's will have a very different potential to reach a network effect from lsts. And so I think an LST can and should be used actually to create lrts. I think staked Eve is the best collateral in Ethereum.
00:59:27.044 - 01:00:52.634, Speaker A: It's eth, but with yield and very little additional just assumptions. And so you can actually use it very well to kind of create LRT's that don't rely on having an Ethereum builder, which is most things you can do basically, where you can do your own consensus set or your own set of operators basically, and use the stake for that. The second thing that I would add is that nonetheless, for types of validator services that do require a validator and that explicitly align with Ethereum's roadmap, and that don't expose stakers to additional risk, I think Lido should be very active in exploring those. So in particular here, I mean, one example of this used to be mev, and Lido was the first staking protocol to commit to using mev boost at the time of the merge. And then we ended up developing this MEV policy and it basically ended up becoming kind of the standard across the industry. And I think we really like accelerated the way that that became like an established part of staking. And when I look now, kind of what, well, data services are possible, I see a lot of interest and I think excitement around pre confirmations.
01:00:52.634 - 01:01:51.554, Speaker A: I think preconfirmations are, are great. You can create the ability for evaluators to sequence roll ups that want to be based, that want to unlock the security from layer one, but also the interoperability with all of the liquidity that is already on layer one. I think people talk a lot about roll ups they don't want to give up, maybe mev, et cetera. But I think the effect of this atomic interoperability between your L2, accessing all of the liquidity and all of the things that already exist on layer one, is massive. I think actually it's like a very underrated opportunity. Plus pre conformations can also be used by apps that are on layer one. So if you think Uniswap, like Uniswap could offer like 1 second confirmation, for example, to someone who wants to make a trade instead of 12 seconds, I think you can do a lot with that.
01:01:51.554 - 01:03:00.834, Speaker A: So I think that Lido should actually explore like become a leader in pre conformations and look for partners to kind of start exploring that with, because I think it has a real chance of becoming kind of the next very popular verdata service after mifboost. And the final prong that that strategy that I'm proposing is to make Steve the number one collateral in the restaking market. So this really involves, I think, educating, like working with ABS's about the benefits of using staked for opportunities that don't require an Ethereum validator. And from the perspective of stakers, I think this is great because it keeps staked kind of the unencumbered asset, but it allows them to basically opt into any point on the risk reward spectrum that they want. So we are all about choice. And I think this is kind of the approach that I think would best fit lido strategy.
01:03:02.414 - 01:03:46.414, Speaker E: Well, yeah, I definitely want to talk about for Lido is headed specifically with relation to the roll ups and how a lot of activity is moving to rollups. You sort of mentioned a little in their ha soup, but curious, as we start to see more users migrate to rollups, more activity, etcetera, how does lido strategy specifically look to evolve with that changing landscape? So you mentioned base sequencing, getting involved in mev, etcetera. There's a cool experiment on blasts where steeth sort of like native yield bearing on the roll up. So I'm curious if lido has any strategy with respect to l two s.
01:03:46.834 - 01:05:17.924, Speaker D: Yeah, so this is also a part of what has been outlined in gust proposal for goals for Lidar. GC is like DaO wants the stake data to be represented on layer tools used in financial protocols and products transacted upon, used as fees, et cetera, et cetera. Like there is has been recent news of Gkx, for example, using stake data as a gas fee option. GST is the l two ecosystem is growing, and where it grows, sectors also should grow as well. That is the approach that I was taking to the l two stuff, and you can see it's working. There are a lot of protocols using stick tether on l two s. There is, for example, maybe not example of that, but an interesting fact, when blast started to make an l two with productive assets, it used stakeholder as an asset to use for the way to stake header.
01:05:17.924 - 01:05:30.274, Speaker D: This is a lifting tight. This is a tight end. It should lift all the boards and glue stake data.
01:05:31.174 - 01:06:20.474, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one thing to add is we've been very focused on getting as justice as possible deployments of staked EV on the different L2 s. We have now full coverage across all the L2 s, very secure canonical bridge deployments there, so it makes it very easy for users to pass back and forth between the different layers. And then I think the preconfirmations is also a very interesting way of getting engaged using not explicitly like state Eve as a product, but using the lido node operator set as a product to create a lot of value for these rollups as well to the idea of kind of sequencing them from the layer one.
01:06:21.054 - 01:06:39.994, Speaker C: Perfect. Vasily Hasu thank you guys very much for coming on. I think this is definitely the most exciting episode that I've done.
