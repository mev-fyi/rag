00:00:00.240 - 00:00:12.022, Speaker A: This is my view on decentralized stablecoins, right. I think that we, as an industry defi side, crypto side, whatever it is, have not proven the ability to efficiently tokenize our own assets.
00:00:12.086 - 00:00:35.618, Speaker B: The Polygon Community Grants program was launched with 1 billion tokens, all for Polygon builders. Season one is live right now and features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of Polygon products. Builders on Polygon these grants are for you. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon Technology France. Nothing said on Xerox Research is a.

Welcome back to another episode of Xerox Research. Today I'm joined by Danny from Blockworks Research and Sammy from Dinero, previously known as redacted cartel. Thanks for coming on, Sammy.
00:01:02.200 - 00:01:04.140, Speaker A: What's up, guys? Thanks for the invite.
00:01:04.480 - 00:01:06.520, Speaker B: So throughout the podcast we'll mainly focus.
00:01:06.560 - 00:01:18.576, Speaker C: On dinero, but before we get started, Sami, do you want to maybe give a quick overview of redacted and Dinero, the product suite, maybe hidden hand in Pyrax, and why you guys shifted away from redacted cartel towards the narrow?
00:01:18.768 - 00:02:06.282, Speaker A: I think that throughout this whole podcast, like, it'll start to make more sense than me just explaining it now. But I think that we launched redacted at the tail end of 2021. We raised around 72 million between our public and private sale, with support from Maven Eleven and some others. And at that time, Defi was just in a different place. We had this very strong focus on creating liquid infrastructure for liquidity on chain. And the interesting thing about that is that we made very good money without having to spend a lot of money, as in like tokens and stuff like that. So we were one of the few profitable Defi projects.
00:02:06.282 - 00:02:47.852, Speaker A: But the problem was that there was a very low glass ceiling. So for example, hidden hand was very, very profitable for us, and still is. But your total addressable market is in the millions, which is like, it's a very good business, but in the grand scheme of crypto, you can only reach like a certain point. And when the defi market was hotter, it was like the biggest bribe market out there. We expanded to a bunch of different chains and markets, and then the same is true with Pyrex. We did PXCBX, I think at peak, less about deposits, more about the price of convex. At the peak it was around like 25 million in TVL.
00:02:47.852 - 00:03:48.946, Speaker A: And those numbers sound small, but considering how big of an opportunity these things were, we basically came in and we dominated. So we started very small and we succeeded. And I think in our two years of existence, we never misappropriated any capital, we never got hacked, we never did anything out of the ordinary, or I guess actually we never did any of the regular defi things, depending on how you look at it. And then I think a lot of projects in crypto start very broad. They say we're going to bring a billion users on chain, we're going to get your mom a metamask, all this stuff. And then you see them over two years, three years, just start to become more and more niche in terms of what they're actually good at. And I think we went the opposite route, right, which is like what an actual startup should do is it should start very small, have like one very attainable thing, attain it, and then just shoot for the stars, right.
00:03:48.946 - 00:03:58.630, Speaker A: Or slowly go to shoot for the stars. And that's what we're doing now. And I'm excited to talk about it, you know, with IPX, ETh and some of the other developments we have coming.
00:03:59.250 - 00:04:00.030, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:01.740 - 00:04:09.440, Speaker B: So from what I can remember, when you guys first launched whitepaper, Dinero was meant to be a stable coin backed by lsts.
00:04:10.860 - 00:04:23.460, Speaker C: And you guys moved away from this a bit, I guess, like you have a separate liquid staking product now and an upcoming collateral backed product, stablecoin product. What I guess. Could you talk a bit about both of those?
00:04:23.620 - 00:05:01.366, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're still doing that. Right? So redacted was this overarching brand, and one of the products was hit in hand. One of the products was Pyrex. And then the big one we were going for was Dinero. And then what we realized was that Dinero was a three prong system, which still is. It's an eth staking product, PXE, the stablecoin, which was called Dinero, now it's called pxusd and rv layer. And all three of them play all really well with each other that create very diversified yield that could like, live on its own and be sustainable without, you know, token emissions or any of these other things.
00:05:01.366 - 00:05:46.150, Speaker A: And that's still the goal. That's still exactly what we're doing. But what we realized was that we had such a big opportunity with it that all the other stuff we were doing and spending resources on and essentially wasting time with was holding us back and we got really inspired by the Bitdao to mantle pivot, the ribbon to avo pivot, where you have this grand that you start out with, and then you just keep firing shots and then something really lands, and then you just focus on that. And that's what it is. That's all it is. The dinero product is not changing, but the second part that comes is the stablecoin PX USD. And in order to do that, we need way more TVL.
00:05:46.150 - 00:06:27.346, Speaker A: We need distribution because we want the stablecoin to be native leverage for the eat staking product. And there's so many ways that we can do that which we're starting to, like, roll out now. Our institutional staking product, our branded white label LST product we're doing with other chains. The rest taking integration we have coming so many different things. But you need the LST to be big and sustainable before you can just like, make it collateral for a stable coin. And you can borrow against PX eth now. But we're playing with some very unique mechanism designs with the stablecoin.
00:06:27.346 - 00:07:09.134, Speaker A: That would obviously imply that it needs deeper liquidity and stuff. Right? So I think that. And hopefully, I'm answering your questions here, but I think that the approach we're taking is like, the right way, where we're looking for new distribution mechanisms, new users, where we can pull this in without having to, like, you know, launch a new token and do some, like, big points campaign and some behind the scenes, like, you know, TvL raise type thing where, like, that capital won't actually be there if we can find, you know, sticky capital with people committing two year, three year lockups on this. Ethan, the things you can do with leverage and debt are very spicy compared to having to work around a system where all the capital of the system can just leave in a date.
00:07:09.182 - 00:07:09.630, Speaker D: Right?
00:07:09.750 - 00:07:37.850, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's a great overview, and I think we're going to want to ask about kind of all the pieces that you just mentioned. But I guess looking at on the LST side of things or the Eth side of things, you guys separated out PX ETH and then Apx Eth in the product. So I guess, can you run over the differences between the two and what was really the decision behind kind of offering both of those two different staking derivatives in this case?
00:07:38.590 - 00:08:36.880, Speaker A: Yeah. So our staking model is designed after Frax's FRX eth. It's essentially like a two tranche system, right? You have a junior tranche, which is PXE, which is what everyone deposits into PXE itself is not actually yielding the Ethereum yield, but it is where our treasury that we've built up over the past two years of influential assets like aura and Convex and Velo and all these other stuff goes towards incentivizing people to hold on to PX eth. So it's a bit more of a risk on type of yield. It's significantly higher. But everyone who chooses to opt into that junior tranche is sacrificing the Ethereum yield to everyone in the senior tranche, which is APX EtH and APX. Everyone who enters that system is exposed to pure Ethereum yield, which for the past like six months for us, has netted three times, four times higher yield than any other LST on the market.
00:08:36.880 - 00:09:19.450, Speaker A: And they are the ones sacrificing the defi yields to the PXE holders. So really what we're doing is not two different lsts, it's more of just an abstraction of yield, where we play with ratios to provide more yield to the people who want certain things. Because what we've seen is that. And you see with LRT's as well, you see with lots and like Pendle, right, which became a big thing this year. It's like some people are willing to sacrifice the yield in order to buy assets at a discount. And then some people just only want the yield, right? And they think the yield is going to go up. And when you start playing with abstraction, you open up like really cool doors in terms of what you can do with yield.
00:09:19.450 - 00:09:21.862, Speaker A: So that's like the best way to look at it.
00:09:21.966 - 00:09:41.744, Speaker E: Okay, yeah. Great overview. And then I guess to follow on, I mean, you mentioned as an example or a similar product. I guess I'm curious for dinero itself and what you guys have with PX ETH and APX ETH, where's the differentiation play out for dinero relative to other staking related or ETH lsts?
00:09:41.912 - 00:10:33.276, Speaker A: Yeah. So the vision we have for it is one, availability, right. And then two, diversification. Right. So what I mean by availability is we can, the way we've created this lsd, and it's not a fork of any other lsd. We sort of built this own solution in house, is that it really focuses in on the validator side of things. And it's less about actually, with every LST, you have the same tribalism that exists with l one s and stable coins and all of these different things, right? And the meat and bones of all of this stuff is actually in what you can do with your validator, right? And for us, it's actually less about the output of PXE.
00:10:33.276 - 00:11:49.548, Speaker A: That's just where we started. But for us, we are able to go to an institution like galaxy or laser Nomura, we're able to go to L2 s, and we're able to output what they want to, which, for example, in the case of IPX eTH is segregated, yield, segregated collateral segregated valid data set, which is very, very key, which no one's really cracked yet. On the L2 side of things, we're able to provide a branded LST, kind of like blast eth or meth or something like that. And we're able to abstract away this whole process of actually running an ethereum node down to our core infrastructure. And it's less about pushing PXE into the masses and more about creating those really good TVL sinks. And then in terms of the yield diversification, when we have our Eigen layer integration going live, the way the system will work will be ether enters the system, it's staked with us, it's restaked into one of our partners eigenpods, and all of the AV's yield, which we were working with a few different avss to use exclusive VR validators for this, it's pushed to PX ETH. So those people who want the more risk on yield, AV's yield, defi yields, is all going to PX ETH.
00:11:49.548 - 00:12:01.420, Speaker A: And then, same as before, all the ethereum yield goes to APX ETH. So at any point, we could be the highest yielding LST or LRT, depending on how risk on the market is, if that makes sense.
00:12:01.580 - 00:12:35.140, Speaker C: That doesn't make sense. And I think, I guess yield dynamics are important with lsts, but with LRT's, I imagine they're going to be a lot more important, because I feel like that market is really wide open, and a lot of people are a bit worried about Eichner yield side. I wanted to ask you about the recycling thing, but you covered it a bit. So I guess I'm going to talk a bit about institutional adoption. That's the North Star for all lsds. You recently partnered with laser Digital. What does that look like? How does that side work? What does it look like to offer an institutional lsd?
00:12:35.450 - 00:13:21.618, Speaker A: Well, it's a headache for one. But beyond it being a headache, I think that, you know, we've worked, we've been beside these guys for a long time through personal connections and stuff. And like I was saying before, all we, all we needed to do was prove ourselves on a smaller scale, to be able to do things on the bigger scale. And when they came to us, you know, they were late to the ETF game. Laser Digital is the crypto subsidiary of Nomura securities, right, which is one of the biggest ips in the world and in Asia. And they were late to the ETF game. You could say they were late to crypto in general, compared to some of the others who have been around for a very long time, despite what they might say.
00:13:21.618 - 00:14:17.782, Speaker A: And we were obviously interested in building the ETH staking side of things. And we were building it alongside them, put it on the market, sort of like a test and prod thing for like six months to prove that it works and to prove that it can scale. And what we are doing is we are providing the infrastructure and tech, like I said, our deposit mechanism, our withdrawal mechanism, which is really cool if you guys want to get into that. Our defi service, like our defi liquidity that we can provide our defi yields and all the different things that we have built into PXE. Eventually the native leverage with the stablecoin and the diversified yield that we're looking at with our RPC and our rest taking. So they're taking the whole thing and they're white labeling it. And what it looks like is, again, it outputs the same token.
00:14:17.782 - 00:14:33.906, Speaker A: But when ether comes in from a retail depositor or any of us, it looks like any other lsd. I think everyone knows how this works at this point. But for them, what our system is able to do is it's able to recognize deposits coming from certain addresses. For example, a white labeled laser digital address.
00:14:33.978 - 00:14:34.590, Speaker D: Right?
00:14:35.170 - 00:15:41.830, Speaker A: The ether enters the system, it's segregated away from the rest of the validator set as it's building up that 32 ETH reserve, it's staked with galaxy on another segregated validator set, and also has a segregated yield that gets produced out of it. The nice thing for us is that even though we recognize that flow from the retail flow and we can separate it, it's still producing the same token and we can still recognize the same fees on it as we would with any other deposit. Really what they've done is they've taken it, they've changed a few of the Lego pieces, and they've built their own solution in collaboration with us and Galaxy. Throughout the rest of the year, you're going to hear about the different platforms that this will get listed on, I guess you could say, or made available for subscription on that will make it as easy as any tradfi institutional place, any broker, Ra, whatever it is, to pick up the phone and subscribe to whatever vehicle gets produced to provide this IPX ETH product to those people.
00:15:42.660 - 00:15:45.760, Speaker C: So the main focus has been b, two c integrations.
00:15:46.580 - 00:16:17.972, Speaker A: That's the main focus. Yeah. I think that we get really inspired by Paxos, of all people. They have their own problems, but I think Paxos actually cracked the nut with this. And I think in some ways, optimism is doing the same thing, where they recognize what they can monetize, which is the fact that optimism, in the long run, everyone's going to get forced into closing down their sequencer for some decentralized sequencer nonsense, whatever. But they recognize that they can monetize something like opstack. Paxos recognizes that they can monetize something like tbuilds.
00:16:17.972 - 00:16:20.284, Speaker A: And we recognize that we can monetize the Ethiop.
00:16:20.332 - 00:16:20.920, Speaker D: Right.
00:16:22.260 - 00:16:42.500, Speaker A: And whether we're packaging up solutions for institutions to provide, or we're packaging up solutions for other chains or apps to provide, or even if we're packaging it for ourselves to eventually do our stable coin or whatever, we recognize that it's more about creating the infrastructure than it is about creating a product with like a big TVL number.
00:16:43.160 - 00:16:43.848, Speaker B: That makes sense.
00:16:43.904 - 00:16:45.984, Speaker C: And how you mentioned that you're going.
00:16:45.992 - 00:16:48.080, Speaker B: To have actually some other integrations.
00:16:48.200 - 00:16:54.456, Speaker C: How do you approach that? Onboarding institutions? What does that I guess BD look like? Or is it.
00:16:54.528 - 00:17:03.720, Speaker A: So we are actually not able to solicit a fund. We're not licensed brokers. We are the ones that are building and providing the tech.
00:17:03.840 - 00:17:04.500, Speaker D: Right.
00:17:06.359 - 00:17:41.780, Speaker A: And it's really on laser here to be the ones pushing to find LP's and subscribers, to find people that come into this. This will be their main ETH product that they provide to all the people in their asset management platform. We are not the ones that are able to go out and find people. What we can do is we can do whatever we can on the on chain side of things, and we can lean on their like however many people they have on their sales team to go out, understand the product and sell it to all the people that are subscribed to them.
00:17:41.820 - 00:17:42.332, Speaker D: Right.
00:17:42.476 - 00:17:44.980, Speaker B: That makes sense. And before we move on to stable.
00:17:45.020 - 00:17:53.240, Speaker C: Coins, I have one last thing is you mentioned deposit and withdrawal mechanics and something cool that you guys are doing on the withdrawal end. What is it?
00:17:53.540 - 00:19:06.292, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so thanks for bringing that up. This is actually one of the cooler things about our design is that we have a withdrawal mechanism where when ether comes into our system, because we have that abstraction we don't actually have to stake 100% of the stake to maximize our yield, right? Like I was saying, we're doing three times, four times higher yield than the rest of the market, but we don't have to necessarily stake everything in order to achieve that yield, right? So what we have is this liquidity, or we have this liquid unstaked buffer. And what we can do for certain integrations is we're able to provide them this buffer which they can execute withdrawals against without having to wait on, or without having to depend on potentially the depth of liquidity pools to swap out, or potentially having to wait, whatever, one week, two weeks to exit the validator queue, which is liquidity is a big problem that's facing these lsts right now from doing something like what we're doing on the IPX eth side, because the uncertainty with withdraws, which is a big thing in the fund world, is not in existence here, because we're able to provide and satisfy those withdraws instantly.
00:19:06.436 - 00:19:53.380, Speaker E: That makes sense. I think we had some good coverage there on the LSTs and LRT discussion. I think on the other side of things. Would love to talk more about the stablecoin kind of piece of the business here, starting off, maybe just generally. Sam, I'd love to get your kind of overview or opinion on what you think the competition for decentralized stable coins looks like today. Are there any key steps that Dinero needs to take to ensure that PXUSD is adopted compared to all the other alternatives that are out there today? Dai go, you can run off the list. Do you guys have a specific approach in mind when it comes to incentivization rewards to encourage people to start adopting and using PXUSD?
00:19:55.040 - 00:20:09.520, Speaker A: We have a few ideas in mind. I'd say that 90% of the team's focus right now is on PXE and working and scaling that. So I don't want to get too into PXUSD because the thing with stablecoins is that the landscape changes every three months.
00:20:09.560 - 00:20:09.928, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:10.024 - 00:20:18.666, Speaker A: And I think that the only one great tool that stablecoins are is a means of leverage for the collateral that you want.
00:20:18.738 - 00:20:19.350, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:19.810 - 00:20:22.722, Speaker A: And that's what we view PXusD as more.
00:20:22.786 - 00:20:23.010, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:23.050 - 00:20:55.378, Speaker A: Like, I could come and say, like, you know, we want to get integrated into Visa and Mastercard and all this stuff, but, like, that's not actually what we're aiming to do. What we're aiming to do is be the most efficient debt solution and own all the leverage and margin around PXE. And also use that as a tool to play with the levers between who's staking an APX eth and who's not. So we're working with different Oracle partners for our big PX eth pools and big PXE integrations for that. And really what we want to do there is own the margin around PXE more than anything.
00:20:55.434 - 00:20:56.030, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:57.010 - 00:21:10.520, Speaker A: And if we can continue to scale PXE and grow it out to the size that we know it can get to, then I think it'll be a very useful tool rather than having to depend on an aave or a maker to do this for us.
00:21:10.560 - 00:21:11.140, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:11.960 - 00:21:28.240, Speaker A: I think you'll find that like over the next few years, a lot more people will launch their own sort of like niche smaller stablecoin, which isn't about solving the us dollar shortage crisis in different countries, but is more about acting as a means of leverage for their products.
00:21:28.400 - 00:22:23.090, Speaker E: That makes a lot of sense. I like the way you describe it. I think it's, it's a different take than we've seen, maybe more generally in the space to basically use the stablecoin as a tool to enhance the overall product suite that you're offering, which I think makes a lot of sense. I guess I'm curious then more generally just about the stablecoin sector, outside of just using PX USD as a tool in relation to the platform in general, do you see a future path for decentralized stablecoins as compared to their centralized counterparts? Today we see tether and circle dominate the overall stablecoin market. Do you see that picture changing or does it really just come down to building a great product suite? And if PX USD is implemented well as part of your protocol and how it performs, that's all you need it to do.
00:22:23.390 - 00:22:50.154, Speaker A: It's interesting because kind of want to be at the forefront of this in terms. Okay, this is my view on decentralized stable coins, right. I think that we as an industry, defi side, crypto side, whatever it is, have not proven the ability to efficiently tokenize our own assets. We haven't even been able to like, you know, maximize the tokenization of BTC or ETh or any other major cap.
00:22:50.202 - 00:22:50.602, Speaker D: Right?
00:22:50.706 - 00:24:26.196, Speaker A: So how are we as an industry able to bring on t bills and all of these different things into the market, right. If we can't even tokenize our own native assets, right? Remember NFT loans? What a mess those were, right. And I think that we want to be at the forefront of being able to like, of being rails for this stuff, right? So both bringing on chain assets to the real world and bringing real world assets on chain, right. And if we can do that and continue to like, build out our infrastructure, then I think decentralized stable coins, sure, they have a chance, right? Because we just need to be able as an industry to get better at like tokenizing stuff and proving demand with people who actually need over collateralized leverage, right? You know, we, maybe not us, but like, the average person doesn't need over collateralized debt. This is not something that, like, really serves much utility to them. They need uncollateralized debt, right, which they can go get anywhere in the real world relatively easy, right? Whereas with us, if we can bring the institutions on board, get them familiar with how operations work on chain, build out the off chain infrastructure around it, prime brokerages and all these different things that can satisfy their needs in terms of margin, then I think that decentralized stablecoins do have a chance, because we need them to be able to access ETH on chain in a compliant way in order to eventually access these tokens, right? Right. Now they have access to these rwas and all these other assets, but they can't necessarily do anything with them after they mint them.
00:24:26.196 - 00:25:02.574, Speaker A: You'll notice with a lot of these RWA stable coin type projects is that they manage to strike some huge TvL deal with someone and they just hold the token in their wallet. There's nothing beyond that. The only way decentralized stable coins can beat those types of projects, which you're minting at 101%, 100% cr, is actually to provide that utility in a compliant and efficient way for these guys to access. Right. So I hope with stuff like IPX EtH, we can continue to like, build those veils where they can access stuff like ETH in a very easy way, and then eventually be able to access those stable coins and make more of a dent on the pie chart.
00:25:02.702 - 00:25:40.984, Speaker E: Okay, so I think you answered it kind of within your answer, but I guess maybe just to drive the point home, it sounds like in terms of a differentiating factor here for dinero, you describe these RWA projects bringing us dollar yields on chain, but they're separated from the rest of the ecosystem. For example, clients can come in and get exposure directly to that, but then they don't have the ability to then get access to ETH and other products. Then you've got decentralized stablecoins that are on the other side of that where you can make use of the opposite piece of that puzzle. Do you guys see yourself as really an opportunity to bridge that gap and just provide this kind of seamless exposure to kind of both ends of that.
00:25:41.072 - 00:25:50.608, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think the end goal is if we can provide a decentralized stablecoin with a centralized stablecoin experience, then we've probably cracked the nut.
00:25:50.664 - 00:25:51.264, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:51.432 - 00:26:02.340, Speaker A: And if we can continue to like enable our collateral of choice, which is PXE, to act as that form of centralized collateral, then we can probably very efficiently do so. Right.
00:26:02.720 - 00:26:18.820, Speaker C: That makes sense. I want to bring it back to what you mentioned about debt and leverage and PX USD. And I just want to understand how you guys are, I guess the thought process behind that and why you think that's the most important bit about PX.
00:26:18.860 - 00:26:22.532, Speaker A: USD in terms of the collateral.
00:26:22.676 - 00:26:30.040, Speaker C: Yeah. And how that approach, because what you mentioned is you want to use it as a tool for debt and leverage.
00:26:30.430 - 00:26:46.502, Speaker A: Okay. So if you are in the real world, if you're holding some asset, right, a lot of people will block, you know, who necessarily is the one providing margin for this.
00:26:46.526 - 00:26:46.830, Speaker D: Right.
00:26:46.910 - 00:27:06.028, Speaker A: If you are an issuer of a. Like a, like a, like a stat, for example, right. So much of your protocols value, aum, TVL, whatever you want to call it, a, is in the hands of some liquidator that you don't even know, and their forms of liquidations are extremely, extremely inefficient.
00:27:06.124 - 00:27:06.760, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:07.180 - 00:27:09.860, Speaker A: It's a means to an end for liquidators on chain right now.
00:27:09.900 - 00:27:10.480, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:11.700 - 00:27:27.376, Speaker A: And you leak a ton of value by just giving up. You know, ave was doing this, right, or Avi recognized this with gho, right. By, you know, letting other stable coins come in and being the liquidator, they were giving up a ton of value to the stable coins when they could have just done it themselves.
00:27:27.508 - 00:27:28.088, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:28.224 - 00:28:01.000, Speaker A: And recognize those interest rates for themselves. And I think that you want to be able to like own enough of the stack to where you have no systematic risks or dependencies on other protocols because a lot of them are doing very funky things with like, margin, which I think we're better off just like owning ourselves. Even if it is less efficient or less, less liquid than some of the other stuff. I think it's important to own parts of the stack that you consider core.
00:28:01.040 - 00:28:01.264, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:01.312 - 00:28:56.050, Speaker A: Once you reach a stage of like a stat or a ret, there's no restaking or anything that can bring more value to it. You can't start a new curve pool and juice it the way we can right now. In the early stages, it really does just come down to margin. People start using it as collateral and they start doing other things with it. And once we do get to that stage, we want to be able to be the ones that issue all those loans against it so that we can make sure that that value doesn't leak elsewhere the same way that we own all the yields internally and we own the institutional product internally. And I think you can do that without going down the rabbit hole of let's do our own Dex and let's do our own l two and let's do our own whatever perps platform. I think you can just recognize your roadmap in terms of what this asset's adoption will look like over time, and recognize the key things of that adoption that you would want to own and like, monopolize so that you don't have to depend on anyone else for adoption.
00:28:56.750 - 00:29:15.266, Speaker C: I think that makes a lot of sense. And this one, I think the last part of the product suite that I want to ask about is the relayer. I guess let's start off with what does that look like and how it fits into PX USD and PXE.
00:29:15.338 - 00:29:43.436, Speaker A: So I'm going to. I'm going to avoid this question for now just because we made some developments on it recently. And I want to confirm with like, our advisors that it works right now. We have some, like, really cool stuff like that we're working on. On that side that I just want to. That we will publish, like probably before, like the end of the year. But I want to make sure that everything, I don't want to, like, promise the world here.
00:29:43.436 - 00:30:43.518, Speaker A: So I'll probably, like, I'll probably skip out on that. But, like, the main purpose of that also in terms of like, the niche that we're trying to, like, target, there is more in the account abstraction realm so that we can, like, take the stable coin. What we want to do is like, make the stable coin like a universal gas token for like any l one or l two. Right. And obviously that doesn't sound like it would need to be a thing right now, but I do think that as more L2s pop up, more sidechains pop up, more layer ones pop up, who knows what will come up off of Solana. L two s and all these different things, I think, like the tribalism and segregation of network activity that's happening, all these things that you could really crack some huge potential multi billion dollar problems just through, like, account abstraction. So that's kind of what we're thinking again, thinking long down the roadmap of like, PXE and PX USD.
00:30:43.518 - 00:30:52.182, Speaker A: Eventually, I think our relay and RPC can solve like a real problem because we have that block space to play with if PX ETH works out.
00:30:52.286 - 00:31:05.240, Speaker C: Kind of related to this question, how does the remainder of the product suite play with Dinero and the ETH LSD and the stablecoin? Like, how does hidden hand and Pyrex fit into all of this? Does it fit into all of it?
00:31:06.540 - 00:32:03.188, Speaker A: Those products are a means to an end, right? I think that we can lean on the influence we get from hidden hand as well as like the liquidity we get from some of the older Pyrex products as a means to bringing more yield to the products. I don't think they're like crucial to our growth because I think that if we scale the way we want to scale, obviously, then those will just be tacked out in terms of what we can do with them. So we view them more as like stepping stones in terms of proving our ability to work with other groups and as well as using it as diversified revenue and using it the same way like other people use it. Like rocket pool is one of our biggest users and stat. Originally when they had their huge liquidity, mine was using hidden hand a lot to like get liquidity going. And we view hidden in the same way that the advantage is that we just don't pay any fees.
00:32:03.364 - 00:32:52.740, Speaker B: Hey guys. Permissionless, the event for crypto natives, is heading west to Salt Lake City, and we're bringing the biggest names in crypto together for an incredible canvas event. Join me and the rest of blockworks on October 9 to hear from more than 200 industry titans, including Nick White from Celestia, Firam from Eigen Lair, and Keoni from Monad. The conversations at permissionless will be covering the hottest themes in crypto, including modularity, restaking, the bitcoin and solon ecosystems, AI and crypto rollups, l two s institutional adoption, and of course, the November election that will be right around the world. We couldn't be more excited about this event, and it's happening in one of the most beautiful places in the US. Ticket prices will be increasing towards the end of June, so get your ticket today. Make sure to use their code so I get some credit and bragging rights from the rest of the team.
00:32:52.740 - 00:33:31.492, Speaker B: Use Xerox. Ten for 10% off on your ticket. One more thing, we're also hosting the permissionless free hackathon in collaboration with Biddlebots. The theme this year is a multi chain feature to build a better cross chain experience so I don't have to have a heart attack every time I bridge to a new chain, all hackathon participants will receive a free ticket to attend permissions. So if you're a developer, come join us in Salt Lake City, team up with fellow devs and build the multi chain future. Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source ZK tech to aggregate crypto, liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains with the Ag layer. The Ag layer is the machine for network effect.
00:33:31.492 - 00:34:07.972, Speaker B: Don't worry about bootstrapping liquidity, just build anywhere in the Ag layer to tap the liquidity and users everywhere. To support the aggregator future and bootstrap quality projects, the Polygon Community Grants program was launched with 1 billion tokens, all for Polygon builders. Season one of the community grants program is live right now and features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of polygon projects. For builders on Polygon or projects interested in migrating, these grants are for you. Join the aggregated future and feel empowered to grow in an infinite web of unified interoperable chains. Apply today at Polygon Technology grants, just.
00:34:07.996 - 00:34:33.200, Speaker E: In terms of growing like the level of integration of the LST and even the stablecoin throughout, maybe DeFi or other protocols, and raising general liquidity of them, increasing access, those are obviously very important. So is there anything specific in terms of the go to market, the strategy and kind of pushing for greater usage integration of these throughout the space look like?
00:34:33.840 - 00:35:58.228, Speaker A: So I think our main ideology there lies in the fact that we can lean on the fact that other people need native yield and lean into their distribution and their Runway to push this product out to their users without having to actually run an LST system, which is quite complicated and expensive. So all the go to market for the rest of the year, you'll see, will be dependent on not us bringing PXE to scroll or something and us having to incentivize it and do everything like that, but us partnering with a L2. What's one that we announced? We haven't announced any yet, but okay, like mode, for example, I think our community knows that it's op stack. Layer two mode can provide native ETL to all of the users on the chain without having to actually like even interact with PXE, right? But yet we recognize all of those, all of that TVL and we recognize all of those fees because they're using our stack, right? So that's kind of how we're thinking of like the go to market and we're working with, you know, ten plus different L2s and layer ones on enabling this right now. And I think like the IPX ETH announcement is sort of like the wind we needed behind our backs to like really push this out to prove that, you know, if these guys can work with us, so can you.
00:35:58.324 - 00:36:38.410, Speaker E: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And that's, I mean, that level of partnership integration, whichever word you want to call it, with l two s and different chains, is pretty impressive. Honestly. I was not aware. I guess, piggybacking off of that topic, how are you guys thinking about revenue and fees for the protocol? It sounds like there's a 10% yield tax on PX EtH, as well as some redemption and instant redemption fees. Is that something where we're looking to at some point return that to the token holder base or is that further out and for the time being, it's just being accrued to the protocol as a whole?
00:36:38.750 - 00:37:24.914, Speaker A: Yeah. So for every product we've ever put out, hidden hand, Pyrex, whatever, always we have a split, usually 50 51 for Opex and one for distribution to the users who are participating in governance. Right. Butterfly, which was the old token, we had like a 16 week lock mechanism where people could lock their butterfly and then every epoch, every two weeks, they would get the ETH that was collected amongst all these different protocols that we had distributed to them. Now, with Dinero, the problem with locks not to go on event. The problem with locks is that it really hurts liquidity profile. So it's really hard to get volume going.
00:37:24.914 - 00:38:12.800, Speaker A: You know, we had like, with Butterfly, we had like 90% of the supply blocked at times and, and then like, the other 10% was basically just like, was like us, like providing liquidity. So like, locks are good in theory, but like in practice they get pretty complicated. Whereas with the industry standard of sorts now, which is just like the single side stake mechanism, which like, you know, most like, I, protocol design experts will be like, oh, it's just a leak of value or stuff. It has its, there's a reason everyone's doing it. And that's what I've come to realize, too. I was pretty vocal about like, single side staking mechanisms suck, but I realized that when it comes to you're always your second product, which is the token. Never, never confuse the two.
00:38:12.800 - 00:38:44.280, Speaker A: Your token and your actual product. Sometimes, like a single side staking mechanism works in terms of getting the metrics, you need to actually push it along to other venues for people to trade and stuff. Because we're doing just a single site stake, we can't do the distributions anymore, but the same fee distribution still stays in place, but it'll be passed back via buybacks instead of just straight eth distributions for now.
00:38:44.740 - 00:39:27.824, Speaker E: Yeah, that makes sense. I think kind of going a little further there. I think as a whole and as a category, we've seen there's a lot of demand for liquid staking and staking just in general. I mean, you can go and look at Lido and Coinbase ETH and things like that. There's a ton of demand for staked ETH and similar, but we've seen a lot of the providers, and especially smaller providers as well, struggle in terms of the valuation within this kind of category. Is that something that you see changing or is it, do you guys have to really beef up your product stack and offerings to make sure that the market understands that and maybe re rates you appropriately?
00:39:27.992 - 00:39:39.034, Speaker A: I think it's not my place to talk about our token price, but I can talk about the general LSt LRT pricing because it's just a mess. Right. So were you going to say something?
00:39:39.202 - 00:39:44.910, Speaker C: I was just going to add onto that by saying, I think less. So, denero.
00:39:45.690 - 00:39:57.570, Speaker E: Right. You don't have to speak specifically on arrow itself, but just in general, like what's the right move? Are there right moves for LSD providers in general to go about it?
00:39:57.730 - 00:41:26.568, Speaker A: So I think the most obvious example is something like Cheeto versus something like Ldo, right? And then even something like ether five, where that fits into the picture, right? And I think what you notice with all of them is that Lido, for example, had really good growth this year. It pulled in like a ton of TVL. But the market prices, the upside potential of eth compared to Sol much lower. And that's why you see something like Jito sort of get the attention that it does, right? And same with restaking, you see that it's just a directly levered play, beta play against Eigen layer success, right? So it often comes down to what is the main dependency for this token. With lido, it's eth, with Jitto it's sol, with etherfi it's Eigen layer. And that's what ends up pricing the maintain the main crux of all these valuations, which is the, what's the right word for it? Speculation side of these tokens, which dominates majority of their valuations. And then the core value of it is usually 10% or less, is how you can pass the value that you generate back to the users.
00:41:26.568 - 00:42:08.258, Speaker A: But what people fail to recognize when it comes down to how much are you distributing back to the users in terms of buybacks or fees or whatever, is how much you actually spent to attract that capital to eventually divide it up. It's profit versus revenue. Revenue can be really high, but your opex could also be extremely high, which in the case of Lido worked back then because they spent heavily, heavily to get stat to where it is today. And the market was just in a place where they were able to get by. But now you're seeing those effects now. Like, you know, you can't dilute a token 20%, 30% in a year and expect it not to come back to the market.
00:42:08.314 - 00:42:08.530, Speaker D: Right?
00:42:08.570 - 00:42:17.762, Speaker A: So Lido, they make a ton of money in fees, but the amount of money they had to spend to get there will eventually. And by now it has caught up to them.
00:42:17.826 - 00:42:18.430, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:19.240 - 00:42:25.296, Speaker A: You could say the same about rocket pool and with Cheeto. Yeah, you could say the same about Jito.
00:42:25.328 - 00:42:25.544, Speaker D: Right?
00:42:25.592 - 00:42:31.976, Speaker A: It's just like, it doesn't matter if you pass the fees back or not. I think what matters more is how much you spent to, like, actually attract those fees.
00:42:32.128 - 00:43:12.510, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And we saw that also recently with arbitrum spending like $85 million on their incentive program and they made back $12 million in revenue. And it's like, okay, you saw an increase in activity, but I definitely agree with you on that. I have one question related to Bearachain that I want to ask because you guys obviously have a relatively close relationship. I guess my main question is, will barricade because I know they have a bribe mechanism. Is that related to hidden hand at all? And broader, what is your strategy with barrichain and maybe even other newly launching chains?
00:43:13.180 - 00:44:28.596, Speaker A: Yeah, so I work really closely with bear chain helping run their build a bear program, which is like the in house incubator, help them like basically from the beginning with the design approval, liquidity and everything, those are the homies. And with bear chain specifically, hidden hand is not correlated to the bear chain by market because it's a just a completely different design. But with Dinero's expansion onto bear chain, I imagine it is like a second slash new home for us. I think that we'll be able to play the proof of liquidity game very well just considering how we did the curve and convex and aura and velodrome and all the other gauge mechanisms that came before that. But I won't talk exactly on what it is we're going to do with them yet, just because I want to respect the privacy of the partnership for now. And I think that because it being a second home for us, we're spending a ton of effort and resources there to make sure that we're one of the dominating players when it comes to proof of liquidity. But I don't think that hidden hand will be there.
00:44:28.596 - 00:44:40.530, Speaker A: But just for other dapps, probably, but not for Barrick core. But we'll be releasing some stuff on what we want to do to play a role in the bear chain core when the time is right for them.
00:44:41.110 - 00:45:19.280, Speaker E: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think similar to the bear chain kind of partnership or strategy that you've got going on, I want to go back to you mentioned earlier, Sammy, that there's a lot of chains maybe upcoming or that are out now and kind of exploring these LSD offerings through their chain. Is this something that other LSD providers are not going after as heavily? And so you've been able to insert yourself here into this particular segment of the market? Or is dinero just sufficiently differentiating itself to where these new chains are coming up and saying we just need to use their product?
00:45:20.700 - 00:46:06.640, Speaker A: Well, the thing is that show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome. Obviously, I think that just the way you could just go on DeFi llama and assume that maybe they'd want to use ether fire, something like this. But I think that the way our system is designed is that it is the most sustainable and safe way for them to actually implement something like this without having to run their own validators just because of the way our code base is designed and it has the least dependencies on things. So that they could spin this up. Like in some ways when they choose to work with us on this, they can even choose who their validator set is that's operating it. So in some ways they don't even have to be in a group chat with us or something in order to do this. It's really just them using the infrastructure.
00:46:06.640 - 00:47:23.826, Speaker A: We're very step back and we're working with Layer zero on it that handles all the messaging and bridging between the two things, and there's a few different players involved in it. It's obviously not just us that's making this happen, but I'd say it's a group effort to enable this feature for a bunch of L2s compared to us going to every L2 and being like, hey, you want to spin this up and collateralize your LST with us? It's actually not. If someone does X chain, if X chain wants to release x eth, they could theoretically do it right now using the branded LST solution without actually even having to, like, contact us. That's like the power of it, right? Compared to integrating so deeply into someone else's code base, like another LRT or LST provider. You guys are in the industry, you know, like how these things work, like roll up as a service type conversations and stuff like that. There's no dependency on us for them to operate this and scale this, which is what makes it so, which is what makes it so appealing for them and why we've been able to get a head start on it. And, you know, with other LSTs or LRt's, like their heads are just in different places, which I think are all the right things.
00:47:23.826 - 00:47:53.376, Speaker A: Some are focusing on doing their own l two swell fracs, whatever etherfize payments thing. I think that's dope. Lido's like doing a competitor. I guess rocket pool is just like, you know, the pure, decent, everyone has their own little niche, and I think that that makes sense. But for us, I think taking a step back from all of those guys and just plugging holes that need to get plugged for different players, whether it's an institutional player or in a L2, is probably the easiest path for us to get to a billion in TVL.
00:47:53.488 - 00:48:23.806, Speaker E: Yeah, I think what you just said is a really powerful takeaway on the strategy here is setting up a product ecosystem to where you don't need to directly have handshakes and conversations with every chain or project or team that would want to make use of your tool. That's really powerful. If it can just reach some mass and just continue to expand there from its use as a meaningful and useful product suite, that's awesome.
00:48:23.998 - 00:49:03.210, Speaker C: Sammy. This is not related to Dinero or redacted, but I want to ask you guys have been around for quite some time now, late 2021, and you've come a long way. And I think, like, from, I guess, protocol and liquidity to institutional LSTs, it's become more institutionalized. And like, all of DeFi has become a bit more institutionalized. How do you see it going forward? Like the ecosystem in general, as someone who's like, day to day, every day in Defi, what do you see the next year looking like, and are you happy with where it's going?
00:49:03.710 - 00:49:53.230, Speaker A: It's a good question to me. I think that these. Okay, you have to be very agile in crypto as a developer, and sometimes you just have to go where the bid is. That's just the fact of the matter right now, you have this dynamic that exists in crypto, where Defi, which used to be like, the most exciting thing in crypto, is like living in the middle of the curve, where, like, on the left side of the curve, everyone loves Solana meme coins and shitters. And they play that game kind of like nfts last cycle. And then on the right side of the curve, you have the ondos, but you also have ETH and BTC, right? And that's where the two pockets of liquidity live right now. And every single defi project exists.
00:49:53.230 - 00:50:31.538, Speaker A: And some of the L2s, too, they just exist in the middle of the curve, where they're not able to attract the more risk on capital. They're not able to attract, the more risk off capital. In some ways, the bull market came too early for DeFi because we didn't solve the hack problems, we didn't solve the interoperability problems, we didn't solve any of the problems with Defi. Right. Which sucks. But I think, to answer your question, I think that you'll see a lot more DeFi projects, the ones that are serious, of course, start to go down this route of, like, being very conservative and safe and appealing to the institution, whether it's an angle of compliance or not. I think you're even starting to see that from a narrative perspective, too.
00:50:31.538 - 00:51:41.730, Speaker A: There's this big crash the other day, and you see the sentiment on something like Aave is like, wow, Aave just works. That's just the sentiment on Ave now, right? And, like, it, eventually that will just blossom as a narrative, right? And maybe, like, the very crypto native person who's on Twitter all day doesn't appreciate something like that. But you could obviously imagine these people that are backing someone like us, like retarded cartel, to do like an ETTF competitor can appreciate something like that. Just bulletproof protocol that exists and makes a ton of money. So I think that you'll start to see this, like, I won't call it a pivot, but I'll call it like a sidetrack, where a lot of protocols are just slowly existing and becoming more and more bulletproof and eventually reaching the state that they want to become to in terms of immutability and decentralization. But you'll see a lot of them sort of start to take this, like, sidetrack of appealing to the institutional investor and giving them what they want so that they can eventually come back onto the main vision and prove to the retail market that, you know, look, who trusts us, right? Like, they trust us. They trust our code to do whatever it is they want to do.
00:51:41.730 - 00:51:55.226, Speaker A: IPX, ETh or Aave treasury, if that comes back or something. So, like, you know, we can provide the same. We can provide the same thing to retail, right. I think that that's what you'll sort of start to see in a very indirect way with a lot of protocols.
00:51:55.378 - 00:52:18.190, Speaker C: I think that makes a lot of sense. And I know Danny has as well, but I've been thinking about cash generating protocols as well, especially after the crash. It feels like it really hits you, like, oh, this needs to get something. Needs to back it up. And I agree with you. I think eventually we'll see more and more protocols shift towards that. Before we wrap it up, Danny, do you have any other questions?
00:52:19.210 - 00:52:26.110, Speaker E: No other questions. I think, Sammy, great, great conversation. I think you really hit the nail on the head on a lot of points here.
00:52:27.050 - 00:52:39.040, Speaker C: I want to ask, Sammy, do you have anything, I guess, any place you want our listeners to go to? What should they do to learn more about Dinero or participate more in Dinero?
00:52:39.340 - 00:53:13.660, Speaker A: Yeah, we got hit by. We changed the token ticker and the Twitter and the discord and everything like that. So I'll use the opportunity to tell you to go to our new Twitter and not get confused or distracted by any of the scams that are out there that are taking advantage of that, which is Dinero. D I n e r o xyz on there. There's the link tree that has all of our official links and stuff and also just has. You can go on the highlights section on Twitter now and just see all the cool developments we have going on. That's our main avenue of distribution in terms of news.
00:53:13.660 - 00:53:17.016, Speaker A: You can join us on discord and chill with us too if you want there.
