00:00:00.360 - 00:00:08.314, Speaker A: Picacio's debut. Are you nervous?
00:00:08.654 - 00:00:10.594, Speaker B: Oh, I'm very nervous.
00:00:11.134 - 00:00:15.430, Speaker A: There you go. We just clipped. We've just clipped the intro. Thanks, Joseph.
00:00:15.502 - 00:00:19.118, Speaker B: Do not do this one again, Joseph. Don't do it. Don't do it.
00:00:19.166 - 00:00:47.366, Speaker C: He did it. Before we get into today's episode, just a quick disclaimer. The views expressed on this podcast by either myself or any guests are their personal views and do not represent the views of any associated organization. Nothing in this episode should be construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. All right, let's jump into the episode. All right, guys, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. The Blockworks research team is back to bring you another analyst roundtable.
00:00:47.366 - 00:01:07.410, Speaker C: Today is Monday, April 15. I'm joined by longtime Nosi Dan and Boccaccio from the Blockworks research team. The jam on the latest market happenings. Before we dive into it, I do have some exciting, exciting news for you all. Boccaccio is going to be the new co host of Zero X Research, so expect to hear a lot more from him going forward.
00:01:07.562 - 00:01:08.494, Speaker A: Let's go.
00:01:09.394 - 00:01:32.146, Speaker C: Hype. Super hype. Anyways, diving straight into it for some news and governance updates. I think it's been quite a busy week, to be honest. Starting us off, we have the Hong Kong ETF's that were just announced spot bitcoin and ethereum. ETF's are going to be tradable very, very soon. I think obviously the US ETF's was like a sort of a larger unlock for the crypto markets.
00:01:32.146 - 00:02:11.482, Speaker C: But just having Asia have like easy access to these ETF's is just good. I don't know how much money there is in China that's going to bid the BTC and ETF's too, like Hong Kong. But that's so like a nice narrative to have, you know, like, I think people forget that Asia has a lot, a lot of money at the end of the day to bid crypto. Some other thing on the news and governance update, parcel token will become tradable at tomorrow 01:00 p.m. UTC or when you're listening to this, it's going to be Wednesday. So actually it's going to become tradable yesterday on April UTC. So for those that are unfamiliar parcels, sort of like a real estate perpetrating protocol.
00:02:11.482 - 00:02:37.524, Speaker C: But more than that, they also have a real estate oracle. They're sort of pioneered this data collection slash evaluation method for like real estate prices and bring those on chain. And they're not just used for parcels own perp trading product. They're also used relatively frequently and quoted in sort of like more tradfi articles when it comes to real estate pricing. So that's pretty exciting to hear. I'll take a pause there and any thoughts on like the Hong Kong ETF's or parcels token?
00:02:38.944 - 00:03:06.140, Speaker B: I can chat a bit about parcel. I read a bunch about the other real estate real world asset protocol. Parcel isn't one, but it's like the alternative. And the other, I think one of them is called realty. And these are like so complicated and just like very difficult to work with. I think one of them is on gnosis and it like, you can only swap it on a sushi swap fork, Dex. So I'm.
00:03:06.140 - 00:03:22.454, Speaker B: I'm not sure how useful like the pro, like the. That you can short or long real estate is like realistically. But I do think it's like the best product out there. If somebody was interested in doing that, that would like, they would do it through parcel.
00:03:24.074 - 00:03:53.494, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting that. I don't know, that seems kind of like a goofy thing like in general, but it's an interesting soiree into what real estate and blockchain what the overlap between the two will look like. I'm not sure if we've really cracked the nut on that because. Yeah, I don't know how valuable it is to long Miami, short the midwest, but we'll see what's uh. Did you mention the pre market futures valuation, Ren?
00:03:53.794 - 00:03:59.174, Speaker C: I didn't, but if I'm not wrong on Avil is trading around 1.6 billion.
00:04:00.714 - 00:04:04.570, Speaker A: I mean, we're seeing some pretty hot valuations these days. So I guess that's.
00:04:04.602 - 00:04:05.250, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:05.442 - 00:04:30.394, Speaker A: Fair on a relative basis. At the minimum. I mean, that's really what matters. Like the looking at the, the nominal number doesn't get you very far, but on a relative basis, I think that's what most people in this industry are looking at. And that's probably the best thing to do. I don't, I don't know if there's really any good comps for parcel that are trading today. Um.
00:04:30.394 - 00:04:32.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think so.
00:04:33.694 - 00:05:01.872, Speaker C: I'm not hyped about anything like real estate related on chain until I can pay for my mortgage with like Eigen layer AbS yield. I think that's the ultimate endgame, to be honest. But I mean, parcel, I think it won't be like a crazy airdrop just considering they're airdropping 7.5% of the supply at a 1.6 billion ftb. To, like, 240,000 wallets or, like, some ridiculous numbers. If you just, like, do the math, that's like $500 on average, so.
00:05:01.872 - 00:05:21.510, Speaker C: But still, like, it's an interesting protocol. I think they've, like, done growth, like, pretty correctly. They did, like, season one and then they had, like, a sped up season two and, like, even more sped up, like, season three. And they have this sort of, like, perpetual points program. So. All right, a few other things. On the news and governance side of things, aptos sort of announced that they are working with Ionet.
00:05:21.510 - 00:06:18.938, Speaker C: I'm not sure specifically what they are actually doing on Aptos, but if I had to guess, this was sort of like a move that they had to do just because of Solana congestion. There's a lot of protocols where the core functionality just doesn't work and because it takes, like, way too many tries to get your transactions through. So it'll be interesting to see, like, what on chain components they're actually sort of, like, doing on app now and whether you can split that workload between two different chains. Because, I mean, if your core, like, info is on one chain, you would need some form of, like, bridge to bridge, like, the messages from, like, avtops back to Solana to register that some event has taken place. So, yeah, would love to hear, like, any thoughts on, like, whether that was the correct business move. But another thing on the news site is BlackRock has allowed BlackRock's USD institutional digital Liquidity fund, also known as build holders, to exchange their shares for USDC. With circle.
00:06:18.938 - 00:06:38.554, Speaker C: I've always felt like if there was a stable coin that was going to become a CBDC, it would probably be USDC. And I think, like, we're just, like, slowly but surely, like, inching towards that future with, like, everything BlackRock is doing with USDC and circle, especially because Blackrock is often known as, like, sort of the fourth arm of the government.
00:06:40.014 - 00:07:25.494, Speaker A: Yeah. On the first piece, the Aptos and ionet overlap there. That's really interesting to see. We had Greg Asuri from Akash Network, who's also building a GPU marketplace on the podcast a couple of months ago, and he had an interesting takeaway saying something to the. And I'm paraphrasing here, but something to the effect of there's trade offs to be had with building your own app chain because they are built in the cosmos, on the Cosmos SDK, and you have to incentivize a validator set to secure your chain. And that can be costly in the form of inflation to the protocol and so he was saying back when we made that decision to build on the Cosmos SDK Solana just wasn't capable for us. And this conversation occurred in the pre congestion era for Solana.
00:07:25.494 - 00:08:30.890, Speaker A: Ux on salon is quite poor right now because of transaction overload effectively. And he was basically making the point that if there was an l, one that could handle the throughput reliably that we need, that could be a better choice for us. And I bet you he's feeling quite vindicated that he's not on Solana right now. And they did invest the time and effort into building their own app chain to have their own state that they can, you know, not have to this noisy neighbor problem where other activity on the chain is now impacting you. I can't speak directly to the Ionet and Aptos overlap, but, yeah, I have to imagine, friend, to your point, you know, it's hard to land a transaction on right now on Solana, and that's becoming a problem. They're rolling out some fixes we can talk about later, but that's the current state today. And so if your business building on top of that chain, you need to continue operating your business at the most maximal level, getting onto some of these gen three chains that are optimized for performance, similar to how Solana was, but using newer research and technology to power your chain and that don't have a lot of usage today.
00:08:30.890 - 00:09:20.340, Speaker A: SWE and Aptos are the two market leaders in this gen three chain, if you will, era where they, the chains that came after Solana, in terms of when they hit the market, mostly in the 2023 timeframe, and they have great tech and not a lot of adoption. So, honestly, I'm very fascinated to kind of see that the two of them make their plays at what segment for the market, that what market segments are going to go after. I think deep in makes a ton of sense. Right. That's. Deep in really only exists on Solana today because it did have that initial higher throughput capability that other chains did not. And now that that's kind of coming under crunch, I think Solana, on an average day, does anywhere between, like, 501,000 sustained TPS, which is the most of any chain today.
00:09:20.340 - 00:10:16.694, Speaker A: And so once we see some of these larger deep end projects that kind of get, get the ball rolling in terms of their usage and their adoption move on to some of these newer chains, I'm really, really intrigued to see how they handle this new wave of adoption, because the problems for Solana are there's like, it's kind of twofold at the networking layer and the, the economic side of things at the, the fee mechanism side. We didn't really know this was going to happen until we hit this scale right against the most used in terms of transaction count chain today. Um, and so, yeah, I'm just super fascinated to kind of have this mentality of what's the fastest thing we got today. Let's push it to the limits until it breaks, fix it, and then just like, keep rallying around whatever ends up being the best thing. And, like, sort of some, like, natural selection evolution playing through here. In terms of what tech, what tech stacks we continue to build. I think you're seeing some really good development on, of course, Solana, but also on the op stack with what base is doing.
00:10:16.694 - 00:10:24.234, Speaker A: And then again, if we can get some adoption to swee and aptos, I'm super intrigued to see how those chains handle and, like, a wave of higher throughput.
00:10:25.614 - 00:10:58.934, Speaker C: Do you think? I'm not sure how it works, but do you think this makes the case for, like, Solana alot? Stan, I have no clue how an l two on, like, Solana works when it comes to, like, data posting sequencer and, like, whether, like, transactions, like data posting transactions would still need to go through, like, the whole networking layer congestion. But I mean, you've already seen a few protocols launches, like, or announced l two s on Solana, notably like grass. I think they were doing an l two, and there was one more that I'm banking on. But, yeah. Do you think Solana l two season is coming?
00:11:00.394 - 00:11:41.306, Speaker A: I mean, it's definitely an interesting question. I mean, functionally, it would look a lot just like ethereum, right? Like, you're posting batches of transactions down to the l one. You could do something maybe potentially more interesting with base sequencing, because the l one has shorter, shorter block times. And so, like, the hassle of going in between two l two s using the l one, maybe isn't the burden, isn't that high. You could also do other things where you can look at the shortcomings of ethereum l two s, which is hands down the fragmentation of liquidity. Like yes and no. Liquidity is fragmented across these different l two s.
00:11:41.306 - 00:12:12.984, Speaker A: But quite honestly, they all have so much liquidity at this point, it's not a huge issue. It's really just that the apps themselves are fragmented across these l two s. Me, as a user, I don't want to have to pick which l two I go play on. I want to use the app on that l two when there's three apps that I want to use across three different l two s. That's three extra bridging transactions I have to deal with. And so you could kind of try to make the play where you, as the base layer, make a little bit more opinionated decision so you're not as credibly neutral. And that's very much a stance Ethereum has taken.
00:12:12.984 - 00:12:42.756, Speaker A: And you look at something like the Polygon aggregator or the aggregation layer, the ag layer, as they like to call it. You say like, hey, this is the Solana foundation is going to build this thing. We're all going to use it. You can go build your own thing, that's fine, but this is going to be the one we coalesce around and then try to build out that way. I think that'd be a great way to learn from some of the shortcomings of Ethereum. I think it's really hard for Polygon to bootstrap their network around their specific ag layer. I think they're doing the right things.
00:12:42.756 - 00:13:00.970, Speaker A: I just think the incentives are for everyone to have their own ag layer. Right now, Zksync is going to want their own one. Scroll is going to want their own one. Polygon is going to want their own one. Of course. Really hard and really expensive. I think Polygon said they've invested over a billion dollars over their lifetime into ZK tech.
00:13:00.970 - 00:13:33.070, Speaker A: We had the Polygon team on the Lightspeed podcast, and I believe that's what mark, the CEO said. And if it's not quite a billion, it's probably ballpark that number. And so that's why the incentives are for everyone to be right. If you invested a billion dollars and then everyone just ends up using someone else's solution, at least you push this phase forward. But like, that's kind of the pull there. So I guess that's kind of a really roundabout answer to say, I don't know. I don't think you're going to see general purpose l two s on top of Solana, but you might see some app specific stuff.
00:13:33.070 - 00:14:18.814, Speaker A: I mean, Vibhu, the founder of Drip, has been kind of vocal about the shortcomings of the base layer for his product. They're building an app, they're building a business on top of Solana, and this congestion is negatively impacting their business, and the fees were negatively impacting their business. And it's a fair point of like, do I need my own dedicated block space? So I think app specific space makes sense. The way that we need to figure out is like, how do we do that in a way that has the least amount of friction? Right. You need to do this in the most seamless way possible. I don't know. And there's a lot of chatter starting to churn up around a lot of AVss on Eigen layer are building using the Cosmos SDK, which is of course natively interoperable with IBC.
00:14:18.814 - 00:14:41.608, Speaker A: And so that gets pretty interesting. You basically have like something that looks sort of like an l two, right, like an AV's. And they're all kind of. They have this pretty reliable, pretty solid communication channel in IBC. If you wanted to know, like, what the UX of IBC looks like, I would recommend IBC fun. Skip teams building that. Super fun way to.
00:14:41.608 - 00:15:16.844, Speaker A: Not really fun, but super easy way to interact with IBC and move from chain to chain. With the launch of circles CCTP, they've also integrated Solana directly into their UI. So you can move from Solana to any USDC on Solana to basically any cosmos chain is actually quite cool. But yeah, long, long winded answer to say, I don't think we're going to see general purpose l two s. But that said, I do think we will see maybe some app specific stuff. I don't know, TBD, you'll see general purpose SVM l two s, though. I mean, we already know we're going to see eclipse.
00:15:16.844 - 00:15:35.084, Speaker A: I wouldn't. I'd be surprised if eclipse was the only l two that says, hey, we're going to, you know, build on Celestia da and maybe settle down to Solana instead of settling down to Ethereum. So I don't know, you'll see some exciting use cases with the SVM, but I don't know about directly a general purpose Solana l two. That'll be interesting.
00:15:37.874 - 00:15:51.986, Speaker C: Yeah, appreciate the insight there. And yeah, fully agree. I don't think we're going to see general purpose Solana l two s. If there will be definitely be like app specific. But I will shoot it over to Boccaccio now, who also has some news updates for us.
00:15:52.130 - 00:16:26.558, Speaker B: Yes. So Monad raised 225 mil, led by paradigm, to bring 10,000 tps to the EVM. I think it's reportedly at a $3 billion valuation, but I'm not sure. Previously they raised 19 mil back in February 2023. I don't really have a take on this one. I just think we talked about this last time I was on Ox research about how valuations are creeping up. And I think this is if it is free bill, which I think it might even be a little bit higher.
00:16:26.558 - 00:17:13.570, Speaker B: I think it's, like, a good showcase of, like, how valuations are starting to creep up a bit. And, like, VC's saying we don't really find the returns that we want in the private markets anymore. Like, I think that makes sense. Apart from that, Sui launched their handheld gaming console, Sui Ox one, which will allow for users to play both crypto and non crypto games. This is, like, the third attempt that hardware by L1, the saga phone, did well, and then Aptos did Jambo phone. I don't know if you guys looked into that one. I'm not sure how good a handheld gaming console will do for crypto gaming, especially since crypto gaming is not doing particularly well.
00:17:13.570 - 00:17:38.790, Speaker B: So, like, investing in hardware seems like a bit much, but I guess it's a bit better than, like, incentive programs, because in this way, you're actually just developing hardware. And one last thing. I feel like they should have just gone into mobile gaming instead of. I can see Dan kind of getting ready to hop in this one, but I feel like they should have gotten into mobile gaming instead of developing this. But I don't know.
00:17:38.982 - 00:18:10.534, Speaker A: I mean, it's an interesting question, right? Like, if you're going to make a device, what device do you make? So the. You mentioned the saga phone from Solana, and that's really interesting. It, like, didn't do well out of the gates. And then people. The bonk price ran up, and people realized all the phones had an airdrop of bonk that became worth more than the phone at one point. Then they sold out, and then they made the 2.0. And I will say I feel a little bit vindicated here because my prediction, I think I've made it on this podcast as well, was it's sort of like a Tesla.
00:18:10.534 - 00:18:39.354, Speaker A: When you're making this, like, new blockchain enabled phone, you don't want to own the first Tesla, right? Those were the ones that, like, randomly combusted and the pedals would fall off on the new cybertrucks. I don't know if you guys saw that clip where the. The gas pedal, the accelerator pedal, like, broke off and slid and got wedged in the fully down position. Um, fortunately, the driver was okay. But, like, you know, there's just, like, shit that breaks on the gen one of things. And that's kind of how I thought the. The sagaphone would play out and sort of how it did.
00:18:39.354 - 00:19:07.974, Speaker A: Right. Like, I got. Got the privilege to play with one, and it's quite cool. Um, but like, there's like, a real App Store and then, like, a defi crypto App Store, and it's. It's just empty. Um, basically, there's a couple apps, but, uh, you can see how it'll get somewhere really cool, but it's just not there yet. But you basically have two options, right? Like, what device do I build? Do I want to go the mobile phone? And if I win the mobile phone wars, uh, I will have the device that everybody uses to access the Internet in.
00:19:07.974 - 00:19:27.196, Speaker A: You know, my device is in everybody's hands. That's very, very powerful. It's so powerful that Google and Apple have, like, armies building the best phone possible. So it's very hard to displace. It'd be a huge burden for me to take anything that swapped out my iPhone. I'm just not. Probably not going to do it, even if it's better.
00:19:27.196 - 00:19:46.312, Speaker A: The iPhone is so ingrained in my life. All my friends have iPhones. I don't want to be the guy with green messages. It's just, this is not going to happen. But, you know, my gaming, I like gaming. So I would consider buying this device, and I haven't touched my Nintendo Switch in probably a full year. So there you go.
00:19:46.312 - 00:20:18.690, Speaker A: They have a very low bar to hit for this to be a better game, to be like my go to, my go to device for gaming, so. But, you know, if you win this war of being the go to gaming device, you have a much narrower scope. So it's kind of just like a different trade off is how I think about building a phone versus some other form of hardware is your chance of winning. So in the size of the market, right. It's sort of like a venture play, right. What's the Tam and what percent of that do I need to be successful? Yeah, I don't know. It'll be interesting, and it looks cool, looks slick, looks like a PSP.
00:20:18.690 - 00:20:21.442, Speaker A: I'm definitely excited to get my hands on one.
00:20:21.618 - 00:21:11.772, Speaker C: I will caveat here that I've been a pc gamer for, like, most of my life, but, you know, like, that I used to have a PSP 2000, and, like, those are definitely good times, but I haven't bought, like, any of these, like, new sort of, like, handheld gaming consoles after, like, the PSV. I don't know. I think when it comes to crypto gaming, I would definitely say mobile gaming is probably the sector to target. Like, the mobile gaming is just, like, insanely huge in Asia. Like, however big you think, like, mobile gaming, degeneracy and addiction is, like, just ten x that, like, honestly, like, the. The amount that, like, asian and especially, like, Chinese spend on their phone and just play, like, these, like, games is just crazy. I'm not sure if, like, knowing that fact and knowing that, like, mobile gaming is huge in, like, China.
00:21:11.772 - 00:22:14.300, Speaker C: And I guess we should, like, emerging markets in the Asia region. I don't think trying to, like, create your own hardware phone is the right move given that, like, this purchasing class already has, like, established brands. They're sort of, like, middle tier, like, phones that provide insane bang for your buck and both. And these sort of, like, middle tier brands also have, like, high tier phones that are able to compete with, like, say, like, Apple and, like, google Pixel. So I think at this stage, like, just trying to create, like, quote unquote, like, crypto native hardware doesn't make a lot of sense to me, to be honest, especially for gaming. I'm not sure, like, how hard it is to port over, like, gaming libraries or whatever, but if I'm living in, like, an emerging market, I'm not spending, like, $300 or whatever to buy, like, a handheld gaming console to play, like, whatever, like, crypto game. And if I'm living in, like, a developed market, I'm just gonna buy, like, a steam deck or whatever it's called, or, like, a Nintendo Switch.
00:22:14.300 - 00:22:45.592, Speaker C: I'm not gonna, like, buy this new, like, handheld gaming console. So I think the right move actually is to build games that interoperability with, like, existing gaming systems. Since these are such large and existing ecosystems already. I'm not sure if hardware is the right move. I can kind of see, like, the point of, like, Solana saga since, like, he's trying to, like, disrupt, like, the App Store, or until he's trying to disrupt the App Store duopoly, but gaming, I'm not sure. To be honest, I feel a lot less comfortable with gaming. Gaming hardware push.
00:22:45.728 - 00:23:04.424, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely don't think this is for developed markets, though. And honestly, I don't think, like, swe is the blockchain for developed markets. There's only 100 validators. It's not really scalable. It's all to all communication between the nodes. Not scalable in the sense of, like, adding, you know, getting to 10,000 nodes. I don't think that's on the near term roadmap or anything.
00:23:04.424 - 00:23:42.508, Speaker A: And so their play just feels like to try to be a little different. And I mean, like, on chain gaming is such a strange thing, right? It's like, we've been talking about it for four years now, and it's still not even anywhere near having any fun game to play. Way it feels. I mean, I can see Picasso being like, there's card games, brother, but I don't know, I just. I like that they're doing this because it's a different route. And I, you know, to. Mert always talks about this on light speeds, and I feel like I'm just a broken record of saying things Mert says, and that's a very dangerous game to play.
00:23:42.508 - 00:23:46.824, Speaker A: But, you know, we got to try all the paths, and this is a new one, so I'm excited.
00:23:47.144 - 00:24:13.204, Speaker B: Just feel like it's kind of like somebody was like, oh, like, we need to do something in gaming. What do we do? Oh, there's, like, my kid loves the Nintendo switch. Let's just build something like that. And then they partner with someone to get it out. I I know it's like a new path, and I do think that it's like, it's better than the Jambo phone because I don't know what that is like. Do you know what I mean? I feel like that was a straight copy paste of the song, but I.
00:24:13.584 - 00:24:45.930, Speaker C: Go, I'll chime in here. I actually think that jamophone is a lot more interesting to me than both the Solana saga and the sui, like, handheld gaming console for a few reasons. First of all, it's priced at $99, which is, like, insanely cheap. And they are, like, laser focus on, if I'm not wrong, sort of like the Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America region. And for a lot of these, like, phone users, the brand doesn't really matter. Like, they just want, like, a cheap, functional phone. And, like, $99 is as cheap as it gets.
00:24:45.930 - 00:25:33.110, Speaker C: And I talked to one of the persons working at Aptos working on the jam before, and basically the strategy is, like, there's going to be, like, 16 crypto apps, like, preloaded from day one, and then there's going to be, like, tasks. And, like, you do these tasks, there's going to be, like, daily rewards, and there's this, like, ridiculous, like, token, like, drop flywheel. And it's like, solana saga is, like, for rich people. And then, like, Jambo is, like, the slightly less, like, developing economy version of that where people are going to get probably, like, a stupid amount of money that will, like, offset the $99 cost of the phone in, like, I don't know, like, two weeks. So I think, like, fundamentally, that phone is a lot more interesting to me than, like, a handheld gaming console and maybe even Solana saga, dare I say.
00:25:33.142 - 00:25:55.754, Speaker B: To be honest Solana saga isn't great, though. That was just like. Like Dan said, it's the bonk airdrop. At some point, you're covering tox. And then people were like, the same thing that they did with Tia, where they were like, oh, this is infinite airdrops. And then everybody bought, like, I know people who bought two five k sagas, so. And now I don't think they've had an airdrop in a while.
00:25:55.754 - 00:25:57.534, Speaker B: So I don't know.
00:25:59.034 - 00:26:20.706, Speaker A: I just looked up one stat real quick. Boccaccio. I was curious how many units of a Nintendo Switch have been sold. And this. This is off of 30 seconds of Googling, so take it with a grain of salt here. But apparently, according to Wikipedia, the world's most trusted source, 139 million units were sold as of December 2023. So let's say you get 10% of that.
00:26:20.706 - 00:26:31.826, Speaker A: You get a gaming. A blockchain enabled gaming device in the hands of roughly 40, 14 million people. I don't know. That's kind of cool. I'm. I'm intrigued. I'm intrigued.
00:26:31.970 - 00:26:51.462, Speaker B: Of the people who created Super Mario and everything you're giving it, that's like, oh, yeah. I just. The thing is, I feel like at this point, if you're sui, like, even Solana didn't have, like, a lot of apps until the start of the year. Not this year, but, like, let's say last year. Like, a lot of apps that you could use.
00:26:51.518 - 00:26:51.846, Speaker A: True.
00:26:51.910 - 00:27:22.062, Speaker B: And they started airdropping money and then, like, to Incento. And Sui also did this very well as well. They had last October or maybe 2020 to October, they had an incentive program, I think, like $150 million. And so it got a lot of TVL and activity on kids. So I feel like that's what they should be focusing on, like, for gaming as well. Not like an incentive program where you give apps money or, like, game developers money, but, like, directly to people. So that, like, that's how I feel.
00:27:22.062 - 00:27:39.576, Speaker B: Like you should boost it as opposed to this. But, I mean, it's. I think it's okay. Like, I don't think it'll be 10% of. I don't also don't think you think that, but I'm gonna make it seem like you think that. I disagree with you, Daniel. I don't think they'll get 10% of Nintendo's sales.
00:27:39.720 - 00:27:53.320, Speaker A: Okay. That was aggressive. I'll give it to you. I'm glad you called me out. That's fair. That is far too aggressive. If they sold 14 million units, that would be the most successful blockchain related product in history.
00:27:53.472 - 00:27:56.144, Speaker B: I don't think they could produce, like, 10% of that.
00:27:56.224 - 00:28:02.154, Speaker A: There's no way that they're making 14 million of these things. They'd have to, like, double down and order a new batch.
00:28:05.454 - 00:28:41.724, Speaker B: Last piece of news is binance listed bit tensor tao for spot trading. This is relatively big because one of the big issues with Tao is that you can't custody it very well, so funds and institutions can't buy it because it doesn't work with ledgers, and it's not on. It wasn't on any, like, trusted exchanges. It'll be exciting to see how it turns out. I don't know. I know Daniel doesn't really believe in Tao that much, but I think Tao is the narrative leader. So I think it'll be cool to see how this goes over the next few months.
00:28:43.424 - 00:29:03.160, Speaker A: I mean, I'm just. Yeah, I'm a little Sus. But that's fair, I think. I don't think that's a crazy position, is it? The narrative leader, 100% agree. Um, I'm just very sus of, like, 99.9% of the AI plays, and I want AI agents specifically to be more real than anybody else. I can promise you of that.
00:29:03.160 - 00:29:14.640, Speaker A: But anybody promising AI agents before chat GPT gets right access over your computer is. Is not true. That's not happening. They'll be first, and then everything will come after.
00:29:14.792 - 00:29:21.644, Speaker B: Um. I don't know. Wayfinder posted a screenshot of AI agents, so it's very close. It's coming.
00:29:22.104 - 00:29:37.800, Speaker A: I know. I just think that that's my. That's my mental barometer. I think that's this summer, so, you know, a couple months from now. So I do think we're close. And then I think AI once, like, why? I think that's my barometer is right now. You ask.
00:29:37.800 - 00:30:03.098, Speaker A: Okay, so I recently bought a house, and the realtor asked what I did at one point. And then right when I told her, it was like, I'm very. I do not say crypto right out of the gates, to be clear. And you start with, like, tech company, then, like, research, and then kind of, like, whittle down. The second I said tech, she asked me about AI. So, like, normal. Normal ass people are, like, AI aware, but they think you, like, high schoolers use it to cheat on their.
00:30:03.098 - 00:30:36.660, Speaker A: Their homework, right? And they do, but it's obviously much more than that. Once you can start using it to, like, do tasks that you tell it to do. Uh, that's when shit gets real for the average person. And like, if you're really into the AI space or software engineering or any of that, you probably heard of the Devon release. Devin's this software engineer based AI that you can just say, hey, build me a website that does X, Y and Z. And it just does it. It really is like an agent instead of the current chat GPT which says, here's the instructions to go do something.
00:30:36.660 - 00:31:04.990, Speaker A: That's the difference is doing it versus being told how to do it once. The average person can be like, send an email to my boss that I have the flu and won't be in today. And you just press go and then you like, go back to bed and your boss gets notified from this AI agent. That's the shit that's going to like start this, this next wave of AI discussion. So, yeah, I'm definitely paying attention. I think Tao is a little bit sus and I don't think that's a crazy stance to be in, but, yeah, it's not.
00:31:05.102 - 00:31:09.514, Speaker B: It's a completely fast stance to be in. Yeah.
00:31:10.974 - 00:31:26.234, Speaker C: All right, I think that's a good spot to move on from our news and governance sections, but now moving on to our DyDX segment with a quick word from wintermute. All right, guys, for this week's DyDx segment, we have Callan, head of governance from Wintermute. Thank you so much for coming on.
00:31:26.614 - 00:31:29.714, Speaker D: No worries. Thanks for having me, Ren. It's great to be here.
00:31:30.054 - 00:31:35.084, Speaker C: Yeah. So for starters, what role does Wintermute play within the DyDX each year ecosystem?
00:31:35.504 - 00:32:34.754, Speaker D: Sure. So Wintermute's been pretty involved in Doidx for quite a long time. Firstly, we're investors, but we integrated into the V one product back in the day and have ramped up our liquidity provision ever since. We were one of the largest market makers on v three and integrated into V four shortly after its launch. We've also been very active in governance and since inception, most notably proposing changes towards the LP rewards program, where we introduced maker volume and also shifted rewards to more active LP's. We also have the V four Vanguard, which was a myriad of proposals targeting some areas we thought could have been improved before the launch of V four, most notably a 45% reduction in trading rewards. Then other than that, personally, I've been a part of the DyDX operations subdao and we also hold a seat on the DYDX grant subdow.
00:32:35.494 - 00:33:02.924, Speaker C: That's great to hear. And I think it's a really unique opportunity for a market maker on Wintermute to have such an active role within DYDX. I think that's something that you may not always be able to see. For example, when Wintermute market makes on a centralized exchange, you guys have zero say on maker rebates or whatever. That's super cool to see. The next question I wanted to ask was, what type of DeFi protocols does wintermute interface with? And have there been any challenges stash learnings throughout the years?
00:33:03.664 - 00:33:39.616, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty obvious, to be honest. Like, we mostly deal with DeFi applications that are like relevant to us on the trading side, right. So we interact a lot with AMM and limit order book, dexs, rfqs, aggregators, all that sort of stuff. In terms of learnings, I would say, like, it's pretty much ongoing. You know, there's always, our main challenge is really like counterparty risk and smart contract risk. And so we're always ensuring that we're minimizing this risk according to, you know, how much funds we have connected to. I guess, you know, these DeFi platforms.
00:33:39.616 - 00:33:46.844, Speaker D: I'd say we also occasionally touch lending platforms, but other than that, that's, yeah, really the most of it.
00:33:48.024 - 00:33:51.048, Speaker C: Just a quick question, what do you guys do on lending platforms, just out.
00:33:51.056 - 00:34:02.444, Speaker D: Of curiosity, sometimes, you know, there's like, we have looked into liquidations, but if we do need to borrow certain assets, that is definitely a avenue that we do look at.
00:34:02.824 - 00:34:21.564, Speaker C: Okay, super interesting. And so the last question I had was, how has Wintermit's involvement within various DeFi protocols evolved over the years? For example, I noticed it feels like in 2023, you guys became a lot more active governance perhaps than before, and would love to hear sort of like how that has evolved.
00:34:21.944 - 00:35:03.864, Speaker D: Yeah, of course. I mean, I guess, you know, as amms and perps or some of the largest sectors of DeFi, we're constantly integrating with new protocols. So that's kind of like our horizontal expansion in that sense. But, yeah, I mean, one of our main goals at Winsormute is like to really empower decentralization and push that world forward. So at the beginning of 2023, we launched our delegate platforms, and that was a super important initiative for us, which in some cases wasn't even strategic. It was literally that we want to empower decentralization. So, yeah, we're a big delegate across like Uniswap, optimism, compound, DyDX, Aave and arbitrum.
00:35:03.864 - 00:35:12.672, Speaker D: And yes, it's been really great. We've managed to get quite a lot of voting power across these platforms, and we've had a really good time participating.
00:35:12.728 - 00:35:34.244, Speaker C: Now, as a quick follow up to that, obviously, I can see sort of the synergies between, like, you guys being a dedicated for something like Uniswap, Aave dy DX. What about arbitram and optimism? You know, those are like, l two ecosystems. How are you thinking about your delegate position there? And like, what is your maybe like, end goal, if there is one?
00:35:34.944 - 00:36:06.148, Speaker D: Yeah, of course. I mean, firstly, like, we are investors in some of these projects. So that's something that we do offer as we really want to help out our portfolio companies on that side and ensure there's like great governance efficiency. So that's the main point. Why we do it is ensuring great governance efficiency. But I guess, like, in terms of, like, arbitrary and optimism, we also really only put our hand up when we know we can, like, truly add value to certain initiatives. We've had a lot of experience with designing, like, intensive programs, dealing with grants, dealing with operations.
00:36:06.148 - 00:36:21.994, Speaker D: So when things like the arbitrum, you know, long term incentive program came up, we put our hand up to join us at council, which we were successful in because, yeah, these are the areas in which, you know, we think we can actually provide value to the Dao and the community. Yeah.
00:36:23.014 - 00:36:34.572, Speaker C: All right. That's super, super interesting here and really love how involved you guys are in governance, given that, you know, there's a lot of stuff that can be fixed. And it's great to see you guys taking active role. But thank you so much for coming on, Karen.
00:36:34.718 - 00:36:36.208, Speaker D: No worries. Thanks for having me.
00:36:36.336 - 00:36:44.644, Speaker C: Now moving on to our hot seat coos drones segment. I'm gonna throw it over to Makai first for this week's hot seat coup throne.
00:36:46.384 - 00:37:38.376, Speaker B: I am putting marginfi on the hot seat this week. Last Thursday, Sol blaze Solana liquid staking protocol tweeted out that Marginfi stopped distributing blaze rewards to users and instead that margin fire had been selling millions of blades per day under the excuse of treasury management. I thought this kind of made sense for margin. Well, you should obviously be distributing the rewards if that's your, like, mandate, but it made sense because, yeah, you don't want to hold that in your treasury. But eventually they ended up solving the situation and solely stated that, like, it was all fixed and that emissions would be turned back on. One kind of wonky thing here was that Marginfi claimed that they weren't distributing emissions because of Solana congestion. But then users were like, we haven't been receiving it for months now, or like weeks now.
00:37:38.376 - 00:38:30.186, Speaker B: So that was a bit sus. But I think, like, one of the bigger parts of this was that basically all of CT took the time to, like, pile onto margin five, which I think shows that a lot of people harbor not bad feelings, but kind of, like, they're kind of upset with the team. And I think this made sense, especially, like, we've had this twice now. I think Starcore was also a little bit too negative to users, and they were like, oh, you guys are e beggars. And I feel like margin fi, they haven't called anybody e beggars, but they're kind of, like, on that line of being a little bit rude to users. And so I. My, like, I think quite obvious take is that there's, like, these are, like, mutualistic organisms, like, the protocol and the user, and, like, there's, like, a agreement.
00:38:30.186 - 00:39:03.854, Speaker B: The user pumps the fees and the volume and the transaction counts for the protocol so the protocol can raise more. And that's like, the protocol rewards the user with the airdrop. But I think if you take it this far, think, like, you start getting, like, a lot of hate on Twitter. And I think margin five is kind of, like, reaching that point where it's, like, a bit. They're kind of, they're draw. They're dragging it along a bit much, but, um, I don't know, a lot of other people are saying that this is the biggest fumble of the year. I don't think that's the case.
00:39:03.854 - 00:39:22.554, Speaker B: I just think, like, one of the founders quit. It's like they were talking about a lot of explicit stuff on the timeline. Um, I don't know what's going to end up with them, but I assume they're going to at least, like, release some more explicit stuff about the token relatively soon.
00:39:24.254 - 00:39:45.474, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. So they started their farming program in July of 2023. So we're going on, like, nine and a half months at this point. Their points farming specifically. So the users, I don't. I don't know for sure, but I'm. I would guess that that's the longest running points program that we've seen in this industry.
00:39:45.474 - 00:40:06.690, Speaker A: Um, so users are kind of fed up. Now. This gets into the bait of, like, should. Like, is that just being entitled or, you know, like, give me my token or, you know, I've been helping your. Using your protocol for the last nine months. I deserve a reward. And it's like, it's hard.
00:40:06.690 - 00:40:48.566, Speaker A: I see both sides on this one. Like, at the end of the day, like, just withdraw your capital. Like, you don't have to, you don't have to be there you're trying to get a free reward from this team that's building a protocol, and for one reason or another, they haven't released the token. I don't envy the position of being a US resident and having the burden of people wanting me to launch a token. That said, I think Mac openly said he was rage baiting the community about the token and like, wow, gee, you pissed off all your people using your product and now they're mad at you. You can't go crying about it like that. So it's hard for me to, like, really take their side as well.
00:40:48.566 - 00:41:07.994, Speaker A: Um, and to be fair, like he said, that's how he acts on Twitter and not in person. And, like, that's. That is very much so. How you get engagement on Twitter is, like, by getting in arguments with people. So there's a bit of playing the game there, and there's also a bit of being a dick. So it's hard to kind of, like. Like, I get why the community is pissed, but, like, I don't know.
00:41:07.994 - 00:41:20.206, Speaker A: Yeah, it just feels like a push and pull there. And to be very clear, again, like, I do not envy the position they're in. That's. That's stressful. So I see really. I really see both sides on this one.
00:41:20.390 - 00:42:07.440, Speaker C: I thought that there was, like, no such thing as bad pr, but I think his Persian Bible is, like, genuinely bad pr. If I'm not wrong, maybe like, 25% to 30% of the protocols TbL has withdrawn ever since that whole, like, PR fiasco took place. And I wouldn't be surprised to see, like, more sustained withdrawals from the protocol. But at some point, like, there is going to be, like, enough outstanding borrowers that, like, people can't withdraw anymore. And I think that's where it might get, like, potentially interesting. As far as Mac, I do agree that you do need to be a little bit, like, contentious or, like, strongly opinionated to get views on Twitter. But I'm not sure you need to go to the extent of posting a half naked of yourself repeating the word, like, when token for two minutes.
00:42:07.440 - 00:42:45.948, Speaker C: I think that's a bit pushing it a little. As far as, like, the entitlement point, I do think crypto users are pretty entitled to be honest. Like, if. If you are using a product, you should be using it because it provides value to, you know. And sure, okay, I can understand that, like, everyone wants free money. The incentives are structured that way. But for example, using a web two analogy, like Uber in the early days, even accounting for the fact that Uber gave you these ridiculous $5, $10 off your Uber.
00:42:45.948 - 00:43:32.476, Speaker C: You were still using it because Uber provided a valuable service relative to you standing on the street and waiting five minutes to flag a taxi or a cab. And I think the same should apply for crypto. You know, like, you should be using something because, like, it genuinely provides, like, a valuable service or product to you. And maybe that's just the state of the industry today. You know, like, 99% of these things do not provide a valuable product or service, and they would have no users if they did not sort of, like, promise any incentives. And I think that's just, like, half a symptom of, like, the state of the industry today and half, like, the way, like, just, like, incentives and sort of, like, the human desire for free money. I mean, you would be kind of, like, stupid to not want free money, to be honest as a human.
00:43:32.580 - 00:43:40.212, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's, like, also fine. You just have to take the mental stance that you're gambling and, you know, you have a cost of capital here.
00:43:40.348 - 00:43:41.196, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:43:41.340 - 00:43:57.044, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the thing. Like, you're taking on risk. And also, like, it's quite a lot of, well, not. Solana. Solana. There's very limited fees, but you're still losing money. Like, Ren, I'll let you finish in.
00:43:57.864 - 00:44:25.086, Speaker C: I was gonna say, like, I think Tarun put out a paper one year ago about, like, sort of modeling airdrop farming as, like, call options. It's like, a really, like, quantity. Like, nerdy paper. I'm not gonna dive into it. And I think that's fair. You know? Like, when you are, like, farming, you are explicitly using this protocol for the sake of farming, and not just because, like, you're using it because it provides a valuable product or service for you. Like, you should be, like, quote, unquote, like, doing the math.
00:44:25.086 - 00:45:08.576, Speaker C: Like, you can't really put numbers here, but you should be doing the math. It's like, what's your cost of capital? What's the potential, like, smart contract risk? What's the type of, like, return you want to be getting? And there's, like, generally two types of farming, right? One is, like, the type where you, like, just, like, execute transactions through, like, Dex. Like, amm. And so, like, those are cases where you, for example, like, farm, like, ecosystems or, like, perp dexs or whatever, like, where you don't need to, quote, unquote, lock up capital. You just, like, run these transactions, and you get your collateral back instantly. And there's, like, the other type of farming, like, parcel or, like, camino or margin fund where you have to, like, lock up your capital for an extended period of time. And there is a definitely, like, a cost of capital to that.
00:45:08.576 - 00:45:41.224, Speaker C: Right. And I think, like, you do need to take into account these dynamics if you are, like, actively, I'm not going to say like maliciously, but, like, actively farming these protocols for the sake of, like, farming. And sure, I definitely agree that it's like a symbiotic relationship at the end of the day, you know, like the protocol gets like a higher engagement, retention tv or whatever. Choose your metric. And then on the other side, like, the user expects something in return, but it's not like there's a legal contract saying, like, you have to get something back.
00:45:41.344 - 00:46:25.228, Speaker B: It's not illegal contract. The only issue that I have is that I feel like a lot of people read that, not the toddler one, but the other one, like, the cost of the uniswap airdrop or something. And they were like, oh, like, it was actually quite expensive and it's not actually good for protocols. Well, the cost of not doing an airdrop is like, or doing a bad airdrop is like ending up like Paris, where you have no users, nothing. And, like, people can. One of the things is like, you can pull out your capital and go to another protocol. But I think, like, because a crypto has such a, like, small niche community still and, like, they're power users, so if you, like, piss people off, they will probably avoid using you.
00:46:25.228 - 00:46:57.942, Speaker B: And I think, like, if you're a protocol, yeah, okay. You can tease people and you can be like Mac, where you're like, haha. Like, am I gonna drop the token? Am I not gonna drop the token? But at the end of the day, like, there's maybe like 10,000 people on chain, so you really don't want to, like, take it too far. Yeah, I think that's it. I mean, I'm sure they're gonna have to airdrop. And I'm kind of surprised that Mac had to go on Twitter and be like, oh, guys, I was always, like, putting on a face or something. I thought that was obvious.
00:46:57.942 - 00:47:24.054, Speaker B: So it's kind of like. And I. I also don't understand why a lot of people hate, like, the product is fine. It's not revolutionary. It's borrowing and lending on the blockchain. But I mean, the way that they were acting is like, there's, I feel like there's a very fine line. I think they kind of overstepped it a bit this past month.
00:47:25.314 - 00:48:11.714, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's fair. And honestly, my hot seat cool throne kind of parlays into this, and I still don't know if it's a hot seat or a cool throne, but we'll make it, we'll do it in a non contentious way and put the SEC on the hot seat. So the SEC has put out a wells notice to uniswap labs to regarding the creation of their protocol. And so a quick one, too, on the wells notice. So a wells notice from the SEC is a formal communication notifying the recipient that the SEC staff intends to recommend enforcement action against them. So basically it's a letter that says, hey, we're coming, and here's why. But basically, it's an opportunity for the recipient to respond to the allegations and kind of get your case ready and make it to the SEC before they bring that enforcement action to you.
00:48:11.714 - 00:48:57.858, Speaker A: And these generally end up in following into like a court hearing. So they basically turn into a lawsuit as the recipient will likely sue the SEC back. Hayden put out a tweet on this Hayden Adams, DC founder of Uniswap and said, I'm confident that the products we offer are legal and that our work is on the right side of history. But it's been clear for a while that rather than working to create a clear, informed rule set, the SEC has decided to focus on attacking longtime good actors like Uniswap and Coinbase, all while letting bad actors like FTX slip by. The industry rallied around them when this news came out, and rightfully so. There's plenty of bad actors in this industry, so it's a little bit frustrating to see. There's plenty of very malicious actors.
00:48:57.858 - 00:49:44.214, Speaker A: When I say bad actors, right? Like people that are genuinely just straight up scamming you. And so people that have been around and have been built a very useful product for a lot of people, it's kind of upsetting to see. So there's a couple questions here around what exactly the SEC is going to go after. Whether or not the web app or the wallet that they have are brokers in terms of being the interface that users buy and sell securities through, whether or not the unitoken itself is a security, and whether, or not, again, the protocols, the actual AMM contracts are unregistered security exchanges. There's a couple different angles here. Don't really know how this is all going to play out. I am very much so not a lawyer and have no desire to be.
00:49:44.214 - 00:50:44.586, Speaker A: So I will have no indication on whether or not these are going, which direction these will lean, but the uni token as a security one is interesting because there was an airdrop to users, so there was no investment of money on behalf of the users. But Uniswap Labs did raise for the protocol using a token sale to investors. So there is still this push and pull here between Uniswap Labs, like the private centralized company and Uniswap protocol. Again, really just the DAO that controls and owns the AMM contracts themselves. So it's interesting to see this push and pull because Uniswap Labs, there's been like a long push. There's been like token holders are very upset because they're not getting a portion of protocol revenue. We'll definitely get into that.
00:50:44.586 - 00:51:36.694, Speaker A: And labs is like, again, this centralized entity that's like a business, a company in the traditional world, and they have a team and they built a product and they built, you know, ancillary products around the protocol, and they have to continue funding themselves. But there's the, the token holders feel like they're playing second fiddle to the equity holders, right? So labs will create a new product instead of like, giving this and doing this on behalf of the Dow, they're doing on behalf of themselves. And that revenue is, you know, retained within the decentralized entity. So recently there was another development for this. I discovered this on Saturday. The. What was that? 13th Uniswap, actually, Uniswap Labs has a fee for anything that goes through the Uis that they've created, whether that be the web app, I think it's like app dot uniswap.org.
00:51:36.694 - 00:51:59.150, Speaker A: I want to say. Don't quote me on that. Just the traditional uniswap web app, or whether it be through the wallet that they have formerly. That was a 0.15% fee from the tokens you would receive. And that was only on a subset of swaps. So it was on like, basically the largest pair was like swapping between, like a stablecoin and ETH.
00:51:59.150 - 00:52:30.926, Speaker A: But it wouldn't be anything like, related to like a meme coin. It was a very small subset of assets. And they also excluded unwrapping and wrapping wheaf and stablecoin to stablecoin swaps. So they were just trying to take a cut of fees and generate a new source of revenue. They were annualized at about 20 million or so over the last couple of months of this fee existing. But after the announcement from Hayden, it was a couple hours later, they quietly raised the fee from 0.15% to 0.25%.
00:52:30.926 - 00:53:10.424, Speaker A: And they actually included all swaps as eligible with the only exception still remaining to be stablecoin to stablecoin swaps and wrapping and unwrapping wrapped ether. So, uh, it was a little interesting they didn't announce this. I think that's kind of two reasons for that, is one, I don't know if you want to go screaming this from the hilltops after you just received a wells notice that you're taking a fee from your front ends. I don't know. Like it was still going to become news. So it does feel weird they didn't announce it, and this rubs people the wrong way. While the first wave of when they received their wells notice, everyone kind of unanimous unanimously, was, hey, we got uniswaps back.
00:53:10.424 - 00:54:04.670, Speaker A: Then this fee hike gets brought back up, which reminds everybody that there's a front end fee that does not go to the Dow. And the sentiment very quickly changed, and it feels like everyone is now again hating on uniswap Labs. When they first announced this fee, maybe six or so months ago, it was chaos. People were so upset. This gets back to the entitlement, or what do token holders deserve? Questions of, you raised four labs using the token and sold the token, yet the token is not getting any cut of revenue generated by these ancillary products that Uniswap Labs creates. And this is a very interesting discussion because there's also the protocol level fee switch, which would take a portion of the fees that go to LP's today and give that to the DAO. And that has been long, long debated.
00:54:04.670 - 00:54:36.098, Speaker A: It's been made the most progress it's ever made in the last couple of months. I believe the foundation recently posted in the forums that they kind of wanted to push this forward. This was all pretty wells notice, and I believe that contracts are going through audits right now. So timeline was like a couple months max for this to start. It sort of hit the forums to really start moving. I don't know what's going to happen now. It would be kind of crazy if you were to push the fee switch through while you're in a lawsuit with the SEC in some regard.
00:54:36.098 - 00:55:12.464, Speaker A: But it's also a power move of, like, Unilabs is the one being sued here or the one under investigation here, and no one from uni Labs is pushing this fee switch through. It's like, this is a decentralized protocol, and it is. The distinction here is quite important. Where there's the labs entity, the one that has created and launched the protocol, the one that is being investigated by the SEC, and then there's the on chain contracts controlled by the DAO and the token holders, and that would be the one that would push the protocol level fee switch through. So I know I said a lot there, so I'll pause, but it's pretty interesting development.
00:55:14.244 - 00:56:30.930, Speaker C: I think Dan might get caught as a witness during the SEC court hearing, just given how comprehensive that was, to be honest. But on a more serious note, I think this fee hike is like the biggest fu that Unisoft could do to the SEC after they announced, like, the. After they send the wells notice. I mean, I mean, like, without rehashing the entire debate too much, there's always going to be fundamentally, like, a caching force between labs and the token. It is very much so, like a zero sum game. However, I do think with the advent of, like, uniswap V four and other existing, or like, sort of like, up and coming LVR mitigation solutions that will probably deliver a lot more, like, yield returns to LP's, that debate becomes a lot less of a concern, just because, like, if you solve LVR and you manage to, like, capture a lot of the LVR value that's being captured by, such as today, and that is the bulk of, like, sort of, like, the ILVR loss, that scene by LP today, then you're going to, like, basically, there's going to be a lot more money flowing around and people are going to be a lot less stingy and thinking zero sum and think, like, a bit more positive sum. You know, like, my LP returns just went from 5% to 15%.
00:56:30.930 - 00:57:49.640, Speaker C: I'm totally chill with giving out, like, 15% of the LP fees to uni token holders. Now, having said that, if I bought the uni token before, like, the protocol fees, which announcement by Uniswap foundation, like, one month ago, I don't think I would ever had the expectation of there being a v switch, like, ever. To be honest, there's probably, like, a lot of traders out there who, like, put on a position thinking of, like, a protocol V switch. But I would have, like, expressed that position just solely in the hopes that, like, Uniswap continues to maintain or even, like, increase its Dex market share, like, dominance in terms of volume and over time, like, increases market share, or, like, expand into new verticals, such as, like, Uniswap X or like, sort of, like, costly bridging. But yeah, it's an interesting position, and I think you will probably see that tension appear in many more defi protocols, to be honest, just because there's a lot of, sort of, like, these like crashing dynamics between like the equity side of things and the token side of things. However, I'm not familiar with VC and like when like saps became a common thing where like the equity is converted into the token and so there's not so much of like a equity token, like divide. Maybe that divide is a lot bigger for you in the software.
00:57:49.640 - 00:58:11.024, Speaker C: There's like a lot of investors in the equity side of things and there's a lot of investors in the token side of things. But I would guess if I had to guess, like in sort of like the more recent years, that dynamic has shifted like a lot more to the token side of things rather than investors like still holding equity and like even thinking about that, to be honest. And so that dynamic probably is like less of a problem going forward.
00:58:12.604 - 00:58:54.604, Speaker A: Yeah, and I would hope for that problem to be less of a problem going forward. It's definitely not ideal. So it's the protocol level. Vswitch is an interesting one. I'm glad you mentioned v four though, Ren, and what that could potentially do, because maybe in a world where there's actually. Okay, so I guess let's back up Uniswap, the protocol is a marketplace that matches traders with liquidity and the trader pays a fee on for the execution. And so Uniswap, the protocol has the ability to take a portion of that fee and retain that as their top line revenue.
00:58:54.604 - 00:59:24.838, Speaker A: So let's say there was like a $1000 trade that went through. The trader paid a $1 fee to the liquidity provider. Uniswap could take, you know, ten cents of that $1 fee and like that would be the revenue. And as the DAO doesn't really have a large amount of costs today, you could basically pass that back, that, that $0.10 back to the token holders. To me, that doesn't make any sense. Your product is really good, people use it, people love it.
00:59:24.838 - 01:00:16.214, Speaker A: And on an LVR basis, as Ren mentioned, like your LP's are getting smoked on average. There's sharp LP's that are like very actively trading or moving around their LP positions to stay profitable. But on the whole it is not profitable to deposit into an amm and leave it there. And so now you want to. LP's are essential to make the whole protocol run. If LP ing was like egregiously unprofitable, there's probably a breakpoint where the LP's leave liquidity weakens and goes elsewhere and less people trade, there is probably a breakpoint there. Or if you wanted to just increase the total fee and then the Dow takes a cut of the higher total fee where LP is still end up making the same amount of money but traders pay more, your volume will decrease.
01:00:16.214 - 01:01:05.618, Speaker A: Gauntlet's done some pretty interesting work on what that trade off would look like, and there probably is a happy medium here, but just zooming out a bit, you're basically saying, let's make our product worse for LP's who are essential to making this protocol run, or our product work for traders by charging more just to return revenue to the token holder. To me, that does not add up there. The ideal result would say we need to build more products that actually generate profits. The even the notion of returning revenue to token holders doesn't make sense. You would return profits to token holders right after all of these costs have been subtracted. So I don't know, I think there's just a mismatch in like, the reality. And let's say you did turn this few switch on.
01:01:05.618 - 01:01:42.914, Speaker A: Like, you're looking at like one, one and a half percent yield. Like, that's not like guys, like half the half. The people demanding it don't get out of bed for anything less than triple digit yield. And when they go farm these things, right. So it just doesn't, it seems like there's, it just became this huge narrative that most people just are not thinking through. But like, and to put a bow on this, I think you can really hate the practices of, you know, prioritizing the equity holder and not the token holder and think that Uniswap labs is terrible people and think that they've had some shady malpractice or are pretentious people. That's all fine.
01:01:42.914 - 01:02:02.914, Speaker A: You can think that and be like, yeah, but at the end of the day, the protocol is still pretty immature. Doesn't generate a dollar of revenue today. And turning the fee switch on kind of like negatively impacts the quality of our product. Like, you can think both of those things and I don't know, people kind of you like turn them into camps and I don't know, it's strange.
01:02:04.974 - 01:02:21.600, Speaker B: I agree with you on the LP, like adding a fee on the LP side of it and then for to distribute to token holders. I don't think that makes any sense. I think if you were going to do it, you should have done the front end, but that's owned by uniswap Labs, not the protocol.
01:02:21.712 - 01:02:50.524, Speaker A: So you can't, which does get into this really weird thing of, like, if you're going to be a labs team and you're going to raise using the token. What do you have to give to the DAO, like, to control? Because I agree, like, there is the. Oh, there's very clearly a weird push and pull, but we, like, they're not the only people that do this. If you look at Solana, for example, Jito is very beloved, and GTO labs owns the block engine, and they take a 5% fee of every tip that runs through, and nobody seems to have a problem with that.
01:02:51.264 - 01:03:18.140, Speaker B: The one thing I will say about, not about, you know, about Uniswap is, you know, you were like, why are people. Why do people care? I feel like people care about, like, uniswap specifically because I think there's. Uniswap's kind of like the. The decision that Uniswap has will likely affect the rest. Do you know what I mean? Like, it'll just create this. Create this new, like, paradigm of returning 1.5% to token holders.
01:03:18.140 - 01:03:34.460, Speaker B: No, but that's like. I think a lot of protocols are. First, I don't know if you're a protocol. This is one thing I understood, like, when McBride was tweeting about it on the market price side, I was like, okay, that's fair. That they were like, we're an american based team. That's why we're not dropping a token. That makes sense.
01:03:34.460 - 01:03:55.680, Speaker B: But I feel like a lot of those teams, first of all, I don't know why you're in America, if you're. Do you know what I mean? The great United States, great country. But also, like, it's very difficult to drop a token there because of the whole regulatory stuff. But I got distracted talking about the US again.
01:03:55.852 - 01:03:58.632, Speaker A: Basically, what I wanted to say was ripping the gator.
01:03:58.768 - 01:04:20.204, Speaker B: Ripping the gator. Sodie pop. Basically what I wanted to say was, I think a lot of these teams are waiting for Uniswap to kind of make a decision and, like, for there to be a decision made. For there to be a decision made about Uniswap to drop tokens. So I think that's why everyone's kind of interested in that, not because of the one and a half.
01:04:20.394 - 01:04:38.836, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I agree with that. And, like, that's. That was the original sentiment around the wells notice was like, you guys are fighting the good fight. You know, where if you're, like, really trying to win this, you kind of want them to go after the uniswap in some way. Like, they're well funded, they're, you know, they're. They're kind of our bet. Defies best shot at winning this.
01:04:38.836 - 01:05:11.394, Speaker A: And some people may disagree with that, but, and just to be clear, I wasn't trying to, like, throw judo under the bus here at all either. I love what they're doing. I love that team. Uh, it's just an interesting comparison where labs is taking a cut of something the protocol is doing. And in my mind, like, these protocols are, like, very much vc stage, venture stage bets, and you got to fund the people building the thing. And yes, there's a token, and, like, we still don't really know what the incentive trade off there is, but I don't know. I don't think it's crazy that the labs team is making money.
01:05:11.394 - 01:05:12.986, Speaker A: I just don't think that's crazy.
01:05:13.090 - 01:05:30.334, Speaker B: I think that's something that a lot of people think about is that Uniswap is still, like, a venture stage team, because in crypto, it feels like every month is a year. They're like, oh, uniswap is already an established protocol. Like, it's, it's there now. It's like Costco, et cetera, but it's not. It's just like, it's new.
01:05:31.074 - 01:05:59.428, Speaker C: Realistically, I think where crypto is today, like, everything is still in, like, the growth venture stage. Like, nothing. Not maybe not even, like, ethereum, dude, has reached, like, the proper, like, stable, like, long term stage. A few random points in terms of, like, the yield on, like, a uni token fee switch. Sure. Like, it's not ridiculous. And that is definitely a symptom, a symptom of crypto having these, like, completely ridiculous yield expectations from the user side.
01:05:59.428 - 01:06:23.410, Speaker C: But if you look at it like, the S and P has an average dividend yield of 1.35%, and at current prices, the uni token yield would probably be, I don't know, maybe like, two to 3%, maybe a bit lower than that. And so it doesn't look too crazy from, like, a mature company. Like, should a company be returning, like, paying out a dividend yield at this stage? Like, definitely no. Yeah. I don't know that it's crazy.
01:06:23.482 - 01:06:47.006, Speaker A: It's just crazy. Reinvesting growth. You're in one of the most high growth industries at the far edge of the risk spectrum. Returning profits at this point makes literally no sense. I cannot wrap my head around it reinvesting growth every time. And maybe that's part of the problem here, is, you know, labs is taking a cut of this, the or is creating this front end revenue stream, and we have no idea where it's going. You know, today, maybe it's a little bit more obvious.
01:06:47.006 - 01:07:12.364, Speaker A: It's probably going to lawyer fees, but prior to that, it was a little less clear. But yet they created this wallet, which again, plugs directly into the Uniswap protocol, and they're building ancillary products around it that drives more volume to the protocol, making it, you know, increasing the utility of the protocol. So that, to me, that is reinvesting in growth. So I don't know. But again, I also see the other side where the incentives are pretty misaligned.
01:07:13.424 - 01:07:39.382, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a good point to move on to my hot seat. Kudos. I try to keep it short. I have tensor in the hot seat this week. So tensor did their airdrop, I want to say, last Monday, their airdrop, 12.5% of their token supply. At its peak, the token reached roughly like 2 billion FTV, is now trading pretty down at 913 million.
01:07:39.382 - 01:08:17.500, Speaker C: As a point of comparison, Brewer is currently trading at a 1.2 billion fdv. So it's not that different, to be honest, I think still a relatively okay airdrop for most people. However, I do think that there were some wallets, mostly whales, that were relatively unhappy with the amount they got. And as a result, tensor announced a few days ago that they will be distributing an additional 2.3% of the supply to top up the top 2900 wallets to make their distribution entirely linear. I'm not sure if that was the right move, to be honest.
01:08:17.500 - 01:09:07.685, Speaker C: That seems like a wild move to do, like, post TGE, even if, like, your wheels are really pissy about, like, not getting it. And I think that shows in the numbers, right? Like, even with that airdrop allocation, magic Eden has gone from, like, a really, really small percentage of Solana volume to, like, dominating Solana volume and, like, 90 plus percent if you look at, like, 24 hours trading volume. And similarly, on another for, like, tensors, the NFT collection of tensor has gone from 100 and a peak of 138, so to the current 18. So, like, so obviously, there were a lot of expectations of people buying it for solely for the airdrop that nothing more. I don't know, I feel like. I don't think Tenzer did this air job perfectly. I feel like there was a lot more they could have done.
01:09:07.685 - 01:09:50.423, Speaker C: For example, perpetual incentive programs giving out less of the supply so that they save more as future incentives. Because it's not hard to see that magic Eden has something else on the roadmap and that you will be competing with them post your TGE. And nothing ever exists in a siloed environment. You're always going to have competitors in crypto, especially given how many copycats there are and how fast it is to the go to market a lot of the time. And, yeah, I just feel like there's a lot left to be desired, to be honest, from this airdrop. I mean, it was a good airdrop, don't get me wrong. Like, I think a lot of people did really well in terms of, like, just the amount of money they got, but from a sort of, like, a business like strategy point of view, I feel like they probably could have done better.
01:09:50.963 - 01:10:19.994, Speaker B: I feel like a lot of people who weren't expecting to get airdropped got airdropped on this one. Like, I think a lot of people were expecting directly, like, linear, like, entirely linear, and then not like the ones that. I don't know what they're called. The ones that reward sybils, where you just do, like, one NFT transaction, you get, like, 810 or something, but this one, like, I think, actually rewarded them. So it's interesting. I don't have, like, a big take on how they did the airdrop. I think it is.
01:10:19.994 - 01:10:34.034, Speaker B: I agree with you, and I think it's a bit weird to distribute, like, more after you do it. But I. I mean, you don't. You never want to make the people who have the most money angry, or at least like that. Like, angry enough to.
01:10:36.294 - 01:10:59.246, Speaker C: Yeah, but, yeah, like, you say that, but I think, like, DC was so left regardless, even with the additional 2.2%. So, like, it's obviously, like, really hard to know. It's not like you're a founder. You can go ask, like, your will, like, hey, like, if I give you, like, an additional 2.3% and make your urge of linear, will you not go in from magic Eden, please? Like, it doesn't really work like that. So you just have to use your best judgment of the competitive landscape.
01:10:59.310 - 01:11:27.804, Speaker B: But, yeah, you know, one thing is, I was talking to a friend, and they were like, I actually prefer magic Eden to tensor. And I was like, do you prefer open sea to blur? And they. They prefer open sea to blur. And to me, it seems, like, so crazy, but because I feel like blur is the superior product there, obviously, like, magic Eden is dominating volume because of the airdrop. But I'm just saying, like, there are actually people who are like, oh, I'd rather use magic Eden over. Over tensor.
01:11:28.264 - 01:11:54.120, Speaker A: I've pulled up this dashboard from Marku. He's a beast. We'll put a link to his Twitter in the description here. But for the listeners, this chart in the top right here, uh, is. Or for the viewers, this chart in the top right, and for the listeners, it's a chart on organic trade count. So just looking at the number of trades by marketplace on Solana. So this specific dashboard filters out wash trading versus organic trading.
01:11:54.120 - 01:12:18.742, Speaker A: There's a couple cool filters that they've created to do so. Uh, but you'll actually see this huge, sharp drop off in tensor. This. This, uh, tensor swap, this greenish yellowish color post airdrop, you've seen a huge material decrease in the number of trades. Even these are organic trades. So this is getting past the wash trading filter. So take that as you will.
01:12:18.742 - 01:12:54.622, Speaker A: But it's interesting to see the huge drop off. And the question is, okay, well, where are those users going? And later on this dashboard, we can see the wash trade count. So basically, the other side of the organic trade, and you can see there was never really a ton of. Previously there was like a. In February, there was a lot of wash trading being picked up on tensor swap, but these filters didn't catch a ton going into the airdrop. But you will see a pretty steep inc. Increase in the number of wash trades occurring on magic Eden, which, like Magic Eden, I think, had 98% of total NFT volume on Solana quickly.
01:12:54.622 - 01:13:33.132, Speaker A: I think that was today, actually. And so it's just kind of interesting to see how that has quickly shifted where we just talked about farmers with marginfi, and if you airdrop to farmers and they just go somewhere else and sell your token, that is not an effective distribution of your token. Sure, you made them rich, and maybe they'll come back later, but if they literally just pick up and leave and go somewhere else and sell your token, that's a miss. You want to incentivize people to use your product. They use it, and then they're like, oh, shit, this is a really great product for x, Y, and Z that I do, and then continue to use it. Like, that's really the goal. So I don't know.
01:13:33.132 - 01:13:49.184, Speaker A: It's. I don't have too many thoughts on the specifics of these stats and as it pertains to the quality of the tensor airdrop. But it is kind of interesting to see that with magic Eden running its diamonds points program, it's already picked up some of the active trading activity.
01:13:49.924 - 01:14:10.304, Speaker B: By the way, the magic Eden team has done a great job with the ordinal stuff. Like, there's nowhere else. This is not related to tensor at all, but I just wanted to bring that up in case they're listening, you guys did a, like, I'm very happy with that, what they're doing. And I wish Blur had done that instead of launch. And l two, like, I wish they had gone into ordinals.
01:14:11.084 - 01:14:40.240, Speaker C: No, I agree. I feel like six months ago, everyone was calling, or maybe a little more than six months ago, everyone was like, oh, my God. It's like, the craziest thing. Like, Ken just run up from, uh, like, nothing into, like, dominating, like, 80, 90% of Solana Nft volume. And now you're seeing, like, obviously there's incentives involved, but magic Eden, like, completely dominating, uh, ordinals. And I think they would dominate even without sort of, like, any incentive program. But now they're also, like, dominating, uh, the Solana side of things.
01:14:40.240 - 01:15:07.984, Speaker C: So I think just, like, looking at, like, the ordinal side of things, like, not considering the Solana side of things, I think, like, at the end of the day, that was a fantastic pivot from magic Eden and, like, a really, really good move. And it's interesting, you know, like, they launched on, like, Solana and Ethereum as a, like, home basis early on, and I think that just shows, like, how nimble you have to be on your feet in crypto, right. And sometimes, like, the opportunity may not be where you think it lies.
01:15:08.884 - 01:15:45.914, Speaker B: Yeah, I think ordinals is, like, a natural place for, like, opensea classic and magic Eden because it's, like, bitcoin slow. So you can't really trade stuff that, like, because blur, even now, like, blur, you can't really trade that much because gas fees are so high. And, like, but, like, Solana and Tencent just make perfect sense because you're, like, actively trading a lot. But on, like, the ordinals beat bitcoin, you don't really have to. So I feel like magic even suits it really well. You just need, like, something trusted and that works. And they, they provide that.
01:15:47.774 - 01:16:05.158, Speaker C: Yeah. Strong greeder. All right, I got one last super quick goo throne. Eigen layer and Eigen Da Mainnet launch. What happened on April 9. I feel like a lot of people have been waiting for that one for quite some time, to be honest. With this launch, restakers can dedicate their entire stake to an operator of choice.
01:16:05.158 - 01:16:36.016, Speaker C: Operators can register with Eigen layer and opt into running ABS's. ABS can register with the protocol, starting with Eigen DA, which is sort of, like, the first ABS. There are two things that this launch doesn't include, which I do think is, like, kind of important. Number one, in protocol payments from ABS's to operators. And number two, slashing. And I do think there's an interesting question to be asked here. Like, you know, if there's no slashing and there's no in protocol payments, like, what is being transferred? You know, like risk is being not being transferred.
01:16:36.016 - 01:17:20.088, Speaker C: Like economic security is not being transferred. There's no payment for the economic security. So is it just like a database of like this person has on paper like half a billion and ETH in like sort of like restrict commitments, whatever that means? I do think it kind of looks like that, at least to me right now. I do feel like it's a bit of like a city season, especially with alternate retaking platforms that have launched. For example, Care act was like a pretty big thing last week where everyone was sharing around invite goes. And Carek is basically eigen layers, but with a bunch of like, other assets. And with Care act, you can restake these LRts that are restaked in Eigen layer.
01:17:20.088 - 01:17:43.414, Speaker C: And, you know, at some point very, very good there, at some point it starts looking a little silly. You know, like, I take Eve, I stake it for like an LST, I restake it for like an RRT. I put my team like pando, and then like, I buy like, the yield token on Pendle, and I take the yield token and then like, put that in Kerak. Like, I'm not really sure what we're doing right now, to be honest.
01:17:44.194 - 01:17:53.954, Speaker B: We're having fun. It's nice. You know, we're taking some risks. It'll be good. It'll all end up very well and very good. No, nothing bad could happen from this one.
01:17:54.114 - 01:18:31.826, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, we got to get the apps that all of this should secure is figured out the ever, the ever growing problem. But, yeah, Ryan, I mean, you bring up a good point with the launch. I mean, a lot of things launch. Like, you got to get it out there, launch it with the training wheels, and then, you know, let's, let's grow. The question is, how long does it take to take those training wheels off? You know, if you look at l two s launched optimistic roll ups with no fraud proofs, many of them still have no fraud proofs, though. They're on, like, the op stack has them on testnet. Uh, and their permissionless, which is still an upgrade on, on something like arbitram, which has permissioned fraud proofs.
01:18:31.826 - 01:18:53.902, Speaker A: Um, but yeah, like, they all still have multi sigs. They're all still going to have multi sigs well into the future. The question becomes, how long can we, can we survive with the training wheels on? And I personally have no ETA on what that expectation should be. Um, but that's definitely something that's a question I'm looking to ask. When I think about Eigen Lair, I.
01:18:53.918 - 01:19:36.016, Speaker C: Do think, like, yes, like, maybe the security of l two s or like, roll ups is like, questionable, given the fact that they don't have fraud proof, but it still provides the value that it was meant to do. You know, like scaling sort of like Ethereum execution by moving it off chain and having like a slightly more performant, like blockchain. Whereas for Eigen layer, like, you are the value and like, service it provides, right. Is that you're providing like, this recent capital and you're sharing your security with an abs in expectation for some economic return. And the fact is, I would disagree, though.
01:19:36.040 - 01:20:15.244, Speaker A: I think the value you're providing is a cheaper way to go to market to launch my product. Like, if I'm an AV's, for example, a lot of the AVss are building using the Cosmos SDK, and they could just launch an app change, put up a validator set and create the same thing. But this should be a better way to do that. And so, yeah, sure, I can't pay you. That's good for the user. And sure, you're not really giving me economic security because there's no slashing. It's basically just like this reputation based system that, hey, you're going to run the thing I need you to run in your own hardware, kind of gets me to market, and I have way worse trust assumptions now because I'm doing this.
01:20:15.244 - 01:21:00.470, Speaker A: But that's the same thing as like an l two, right? The blast hack that happened not too long ago, everyone was talking about rolling back the chain was an interesting example because sure, you could potentially roll back the chain and. But if you. Nobody's ever done that before, so you're the first person doing it, paving the way for other people to follow in your footsteps if this were to happen again. And what that means is if you upgrade the bridge contract and end up bricking it, then you just locked and just burned all the billion dollars of value in that contract. So nobody wants to be the person to do that. So I don't know, like, my point there being like, there's, there's just different trust assumptions with l two s that get introduced and like, it kind of feels like the same thing with these Avss. No slashing, no in protocol payments.
01:21:00.470 - 01:21:09.674, Speaker A: You're just kind of saying, hey, go run this thing for me. How, how dissimilar is that really than a single centralized sequencer, no fraud proofs, and a multisig bridge.
01:21:10.934 - 01:21:43.170, Speaker C: That's fair. I think that's a very fair take. And like food disclosure. If I was, I can layer and I knew it would take me like six months more to like fully developed in protocol payments and slashing, like, I would have made that entirely safe move to be honest. Just a faster go to market. You don't want to like wait until like the entire site goes over to launch these two products and by then, you know, like maybe alternative solutions have captured the entire mindshare. And I'm sure like other restaking solutions are also just trying to ship as fast as it can, even if it comes at the cost of like some of these like functionality, whether that's slashing and.
01:21:43.170 - 01:21:57.444, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess so. You could argue that at the end of the day, like the thing that's the most important is that like capital commitment, however you want to like think of that, and that is like the true enabler of like all of these abs's and decreasing the cost of like permissionless innovation.
01:21:58.384 - 01:22:04.484, Speaker B: Yeah. Dan, do you want to talk a bit about your eigen layer token thesis or no?
01:22:06.264 - 01:22:43.922, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know if it's a thesis, I just don't. If your end goal is to be ingrained or enshrined into the Ethereum protocol, I don't see how you can do that with a token. Or maybe not. Don't see the hurdle to doing so is much higher with a token. If there's an eigen layer itself token, how do you get enshrined? My understanding is that's the end goal, long term end goal. We actually had Sriram and Subit, I think it was on the podcast. Ren and I interviewed them and we asked the question, this is all fine and dandy.
01:22:43.922 - 01:23:14.180, Speaker A: You guys are building really cool shit, but how are you going to make money? You know, you raise capital, you're the labs team is a business. You got to make money. And their answer was, we're going to build the best avss. We've been around this technology for longer than anyone, and I'm paraphrasing here, but we've been around this technology, we know some really, really good ideas and we're going to send our guys to go build them. Like, that was kind of their pitch was, we're not going to make money on Eigen layer, we're going to make money on the Avss around it. That said, like, a token could be very useful here. Right.
01:23:14.180 - 01:23:51.384, Speaker A: Eigen layer will have really important governance processes around, like how the slashing parameters are created and what those look like, how they change throughout time. You know, I mentioned the training wheels earlier. How do we take those off? When do we take those off? Like a governance token would actually serve a purpose here. So I do see why there can be one, but I just think it sort of conflates with the end goal of being enshrined. Maybe that's not the end goal. Maybe like sitting on top of Ethereum is perfectly fine. I don't know, I just think if end goal enshrined in Ethereum, then token doesn't make sense.
01:23:51.384 - 01:24:07.070, Speaker A: But like, there's a points program, you know, this team also just saw what happened with margin fry. Marginfi, um, that'd be disastrous for Ethereum if, you know, all of these depositors are now furious with Eigen layer. I don't think that would go over very well.
01:24:07.182 - 01:24:32.624, Speaker B: No, I also don't think so, especially since it's like, because Solana's now had a couple of liquidity injections and I feel like Ethereum, people are expecting one as well. But one thing about the enshrinement thing is that I, like, this is an old, this is going to be my first attempt at presenting something, but I want to try it out. But basically on the case here.
01:24:34.484 - 01:24:35.148, Speaker A: Yep.
01:24:35.276 - 01:24:57.728, Speaker B: Okay, so basically this is like on the Eve research forum, and it's very clearly that like both Hurom and Vitalik are like, we don't think that it makes sense to and try. So I'm not sure because I've been hearing quite a bit they're going to enshrine and I'm just kind of unclear.
01:24:57.856 - 01:25:24.244, Speaker A: I thought that was a goal and I could, I'm very happy to be wrong about that. I don't, I'm not, that's not a hill I'm trying to die on. So that's, that's good to know. But, and the other reason I think it that is new to when we originally talked about this was, you know, crack is launching and there's another one launching shortly after that. I'm blanking on the name. I'm sure more of these will come to be, you'll probably see like some launch on other chains as well. And so let's say there's multiple that launch around Ethereum.
01:25:24.244 - 01:25:38.204, Speaker A: Okay, now you're not being credibly neutral because you're picking one. And like Ethereum very much so has built itself around being incredibly neutral and not picking winners. So that kind of, like, when we originally talked about this, I didn't think there'd actually be multiple restaking protocols.
01:25:40.344 - 01:25:42.318, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.
01:25:42.496 - 01:25:59.298, Speaker A: I like that kind of does feel like something there should maybe only be one of. I know we talk about, like, we all love competition. Free markets are elite, but if we all try all these paths, sometimes coalescing around a few ideas might be more efficient. I don't know.
01:25:59.426 - 01:26:05.774, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. It feels like Eigen layer should be its own thing, and, like, it should just be that.
01:26:06.274 - 01:26:13.584, Speaker C: Well, Picacho just defined a market for us. Thank you, Picacio. Can you tell me one of my bags is going to be its own thing?
01:26:14.364 - 01:26:17.264, Speaker B: Oh, I meant, like, it should be its own thing, not.
01:26:18.524 - 01:26:32.116, Speaker C: I'm messing with you, but I think that's a good point to close it off. Uh, thank you so much, Stan, for coming back on Zox. Hope you come back more often, and good job, Akacha, on your first episode, the new host.
01:26:32.180 - 01:26:33.604, Speaker A: Baby, let's go.
