00:00:00.320 - 00:00:27.641, Speaker A: If something just has the association of. There's this like, you know, kind of concept of like, throwing the baby out with the bathwater, right? Like, kind of. Just because, you know, just because the bathwater is bad doesn't mean you should throw the baby out the window too, right? I think just because tradfi is bad, because it's centralized does not mean that we can't learn from it and take a la carte the best parts of it. And I think what tradfi got right, that we are way too arrogant as an industry to accept is they got trading right.

00:01:06.541 - 00:01:14.745, Speaker B: What's up, guys? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Today I'm joined by Roy and Joshua from Aori. Thanks for coming on, guys.
00:01:15.245 - 00:01:16.669, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:01:16.797 - 00:01:18.145, Speaker C: Thanks for having us, mate.
00:01:19.125 - 00:01:22.529, Speaker B: Before we get started, do you guys want to tell a little bit about what you guys are building?
00:01:22.677 - 00:01:53.615, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Happy to start. Yeah. So, Joshua from Aori. Yeah, I guess at real high level, what we're building at Aori is a, you know, we like to use the term, like, high frequency intense protocol to sound really cool and make the VCs really happy. But in reality, that just means, like, you know, you want to trade in defi, you want the best possible price on whatever chain you're trying to execute on, and you need it to execute this block or, you know, whatever the block is that you demand it to be executed by.
00:01:53.615 - 00:02:00.095, Speaker A: And we're the best at that. So, yeah, really, really simple definition of a perfect.
00:02:00.875 - 00:02:08.507, Speaker B: And why did you decide to build a Ori? What was the. Like, some of the problems that you guys wanted to specifically solve?
00:02:08.691 - 00:02:21.943, Speaker A: So you might notice, I'm losing my hair. I've lost a lot of it. I don't know how many years left I have of it. But that's mostly the fault of defi protocols. Um, you know, it's nothing. It's none of that health stuff. Or testosterone or whatever.
00:02:21.943 - 00:03:34.475, Speaker A: It's having to be a market maker on a bunch of dexes made me want rip it out. So yeah, that's the main reason. But no, just to be more specific, I was a market maker. Previously made markets on a across mostly options, but towards the latter half of my career in market making was trade to be the dedicated market maker for a lot of Dexes, for a lot of AMMs, for a lot of on chain clubs, even some off chain auction platforms. And these things were just like completely intellectual thought experiments that went way too far and ended up causing lots of, lots of negative externalities and harm to users that I think a lot of DEFI protocols and DEFI founders want to ignore. And that's really what I think the reason AORI exists is to minimize the amount of harm to the end user or actually make it negative. And lot of cases that's really the end goal is make DEFI as great of an experience as possible and one where you're with every action you do, you're not leaking out tons of alpha, tons of value to be captured by people who are looking to exploit you.
00:03:34.475 - 00:03:37.631, Speaker A: So that was kind of really what led to the creation of iori.
00:03:37.783 - 00:03:58.705, Speaker B: That makes sense. And I want to get into all of that specifically around AMM design later in. But I guess like to start us off a bit, how does Aori work on the back end? What? I remember you guys using Seaport contracts. Is that still the case? If so, why did you decide to use Seaport and was it difficult integrating it?
00:03:58.865 - 00:04:31.817, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess maybe I'll give like a little bit of like a little bit of like a detailed roadmap or I guess like not a roadmap really, more like a. Like why we chose to use something like, for example, a lot of users, a lot of people, unless they're really technical, probably have no idea what Seaport even is. Right. So. So everybody's really familiar with AMMs. These are, you know, your standard on chain market makers that, you know, you add liquidity to on both sides and, you know, the definition of market making is I'm going to be a buyer and a seller at all times. I'm going to, I'm going to have bids and I'm going to have asks at all times.
00:04:31.817 - 00:05:25.843, Speaker A: And that's exactly what an automated market maker does. It puts liquidity on both sides of the book and lets you, you know, even like fancy stuff with like V3, you can, you know, add custom ranges or whatever. But like, it's basically just like, I'M announcing my, you know, bids and asks ahead of time on chain and this leaks the most, you know, exploitable trading information possible. Then there are. You can get a little bit better with things like on chain clubs where like you're able to update like on really fast blockchains like on Solana with like, you know, serum slash, like Open Order book slash Phoenix, where you can update your quotes really fast. So it's much closer to that of like a centralized exchange and as a market maker, you're leaking less alpha. And then I guess like one step in the right direction but in a completely different way is something like Cow Swap or Uniswap X where it's completely off chain.
00:05:25.843 - 00:05:51.387, Speaker A: It's all based on these things called signatures. You probably, if you use MetaMask or Rabi or any of these wallets, you've definitely used a signature before. It's that gasless little button that just says sign. These are basically auctions that auction off your order. There are problems with auctions. I'll get into this probably later if we were interested in talking about that. But what AORI is, it's based on this Smart contract that OpenSea created called Seaport.
00:05:51.387 - 00:06:46.621, Speaker A: Seaport is basically a signature platform for trading where they basically made this hyper generalized signature trading platform where like Bach, I can sign a message that says, I would like to sell one Ethereum and I want at least 3,000 USDC. And then you can sign a mirrored order that says, yep, I'm willing to send you 3,000 USDC if you give me one Ethereum. And then we both take our signatures, we plug them into the smart contract and then we, when we settle that trade, we both get our tokens. And if we both have the correct number of tokens in each of our wallets, the trade clears. If you've ever done an NFT trade on OpenSea or on Blur, you have used Seaport and that was what, what what you used. And Aori was like, I guess like the idea behind Aori is, you know, opensea put in a lot of barriers to be able to trade ERC 20s for ERC 20s they specifically want. We're like, okay, only NFTs for NFTs or NFTs for ETH or whatever.
00:06:46.621 - 00:07:18.865, Speaker A: We were like, okay, well what if we made it? What if we tried built a dex on top of this? And that's really where it came from is like, what if we built the dex on top of this thing? And we did and worked really well. We don't use Cport anymore. We've made some optimizations like OpenSea built seaport for NFTs. So it's got a lot of gas optimizations for NFTs that it doesn't have for your C20. So we just, we just made a lot of those optimizations, but it's the exact same architecture, same infrastructure style, signatures for trades and then settlement. You only pay GAS at the time of settlement, so.
00:07:18.905 - 00:07:45.531, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. And one more thing that I wanted to ask about that's slightly related to this is that when I know we said you don't use Seaport anymore, but let's say I say, okay, I want like 3,000 USDC for one, if that goes on as an intent. But one thing that you guys talk about is limit orders as intense. What does this mean? How does it. I guess, what are the implications? Because we hear a lot of this intents are just limit orders.
00:07:45.723 - 00:08:35.405, Speaker A: Yeah, I think crypto and defi founders in general especially are obsessed with creating narratives. And like, don't get me wrong, I think like a lot of the work like the Enoma guys have done has been spectacular on defining intents as things that can go beyond limit orders. But today intents are just swaps. They're just limit orders. And so when we say intents as limit orders, we say like, let's boil down an intent to its most basic format. And that is basically input token, output token, and whatever the chain that I want to sell that trade is on. Even like one thing that like the Anoma team has like talked about is that an intent should basically just be, I have a portfolio at time one and I have what I want my portfolio to be at time two.
00:08:35.405 - 00:09:08.185, Speaker A: And a solver has to get me from state one to state two. And that can just basically be a collection of swaps, for example. So that's really like how we, we view intents at their like most fundamental form. We actually, before they were called intents, we were calling them virtual orders because they're basically, you know, like, we consider like real orders to be like, I'm paying the gas, I'm creating an on chain limit order. So a virtual order is just a signature that's just, it's all held off chain. It's basically waiting for some, you know, counterparty to fill it effectively.
00:09:09.245 - 00:09:32.705, Speaker D: So with these like virtual limit orders, you know, or intents is like can I define that anything else other than the AB swap tokens are there is, are there more express, potential, expressive, I guess like options that I can have as a swapper, such as like I want X for Y over time. Z.
00:09:33.565 - 00:10:24.725, Speaker A: Yes, that's a, that's a great point. Yeah, the really like, we've, we've kind of written some about this, some we've published some we haven't a lot of this. So when you, when you look at intents as like this, if you boil them down to just pure limit orders, right? Like if you look at defi in general, what is defi but a bunch of protocols that are effectively expressing combinations of swaps. So like, let's look for example at like a money market protocol like compound or aave, right? Like what is, what is opening a loan? Opening a loan is I'm sending the lending protocol my collateral token and I'm getting back whatever asset I'm borrowing. And then after some time after N blocks in the future, I can then send back the loan token plus interest and then get back my collateral token. That's just two swaps, like any. That's, that's not that complicated.
00:10:24.725 - 00:11:02.759, Speaker A: It's just two swaps. And so like what we've explored and we've built some like, proof of concepts of. But like, if anybody wants to reach out to me in the future is interested in kind of stuff like this, we're big believers that the future of all DEFI protocols will be built on top of intent limit order primitives like aori. So I can build a money market protocol that's built entirely in like a te, for example, or something similar on top of Aori that, like I just said, I'm just doing one swap to get into a, into a loan position. And then I'm calculating the interest in this environment. And then after some time I'm asking the user to pay back the loan. And if they don't pay it back, I'm going to liquidate them.
00:11:02.759 - 00:11:21.245, Speaker A: And it's all done entirely through basically these solvers who are finding you optimal swaps. So yeah, I'm a big believer that like all DEFI protocols in the future will move to this. Like, perps are just a bunch of swaps. Money markets are just a bunch of swaps. You know, this is kind of the direction I think it'll all go.
00:11:21.745 - 00:12:00.125, Speaker D: We're all, we're all swapping information in the end of the day. I did have a question going back to, you know, what you were talking about in terms of some of the motivation beyond ari, which involves, you know, almost like providing users protection against, you know, various exploitation. So like going back to one of the points that you made earlier about how the Motivation of IORI was to you know like solve for how to protect users that are getting exploited. Could you speak a little bit more to like what users you're talking about and the types of exploitation that exist?
00:12:01.435 - 00:13:03.085, Speaker A: Honest? I mean like it's funny you say what types of users like honestly there's only like a handful of users who use any existing on chain clob on chain AMM auction platform that aren't being exploited. The better question is like who's not being, who isn't being exploited? Because like when you look at like AMMS for example like the everybody knows about impermanent loss and lvr but they don't realize the extent to which these trades are being exploited. Every single swap you do on the Uniswap front end or through any kind of router, you're almost certainly whether you know it or not having your transaction be front run and back run by either a searcher who has some kind of an agreement with a vertically integrated builder searcher. So a block builder that like is ordering all the transactions. So it's not even like you know Jared from Subway anymore is like the exclusive one doing this. There's a bunch of them that are just like basically front running and back running you versus C5 liquidity versus DeFi liquidity. Like your trade is being exploited whether you know it or not.
00:13:03.085 - 00:14:00.593, Speaker A: And, and additionally there's been some like really good like threads and like papers about this about like the maximum exploitable value. Like like there's some crazy stuff now where like you it's so complicated now that whenever you do a swap on like Uniswap for example the best arbor that's arming your your trade is likely doing something like a front run a jit liquidity. Then there's your trade, then they're back running you, then they're burning their liquidity and after, after they they jit made and then take burn their their just in time liquidity at the end of the trade. So they're doing like these like multi legged transactions to like screw you on chain clubs. And like auction platforms are a little bit more complicated in terms of like how the user is being like taken advantage of on chain clubs. The you're minimizing a lot of the problems of announcing your strategy ahead of time. So like a big like impermanent loss.
00:14:00.593 - 00:15:10.827, Speaker A: The problem with impermanent losses, you're telling me every single order you're going to place and then I can basically say I can maximally arbitrage you against a more liquid venue Like Binance, for example, on an on chain club, you can update your orders really fast and you can be really granular with them. The issue though is you can only update your orders as fast as the block time. And now there are a lot of people who are like, like, and this is not like talking shit about any of these like really fast new blockchains that are coming out, like Monad or, you know, Mega Eth or anything like that. They're spectacular tech. Like, I think they're going to be incredible platforms, but specifically with relation to believing that like an on chain club could work on these platforms. Like, I did a panel at ECC and I thought this was really funny. One of the, one of the panelists, without naming who they were, they were, they ran one of the biggest on chain clubs and they were telling me like, yeah, whenever we started our protocol, you know, we didn't have any issues whatsoever with gas, but now, you know, and they're on a very fast L1 that has very low gas and they're like, within the last year, gas has 10x and our spreads have increased by several basis points just because of how congested the network has got.
00:15:10.827 - 00:15:48.967, Speaker A: And it's like, that's the inevitability of any on chain club. Like you're, you will always be worse than Binance. Because I'm having, I can't update my orders as fast and I have to pay GAS to place these orders. So what that means is the end user, whoever, whoever's tapping into this liquidity is getting worse prices than they then they should be. And auctions, like, just to breeze through auctions real quick. The issue is just with auctions, if Binance is, if the asset we're auctioning off, like on cow swap is like eth and Binance is quoting me one price. If I'm a bidder on this auction, like if I'm a solver, I'm never in my wildest imagination going to bid the fair value of Ethereum.
00:15:48.967 - 00:16:05.277, Speaker A: I'm always going to bid under the fair value of Ethereum because I have to make profit. If I don't make profit, then what am I doing here? Like, why am I solving on this auction platform? Right? So that's kind of a lot of the. When we kind of architected Aori, the big premise was like, how the hell do we minimize this as much as humanly possible?
00:16:05.431 - 00:16:50.143, Speaker B: Hey guys. Permissionless. The event for crypto natives is heading west to Salt Lake City and we're bringing the biggest names in crypto together for an incredible can't miss event.

All Hackathon participants will receive a free ticket to attend permissions, so if you're a developer, come join us in Salt Lake City, team up with fellow devs and build the multichain future. Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source ZK tech to aggregate crypto liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains with the AG layer. The AG layer is a machine for network effect.
00:17:33.590 - 00:18:25.615, Speaker B: Don't worry about bootstrapping liquidity, just build anywhere in the AG layer to tap the liquidity end users everywhere. To support the aggregated future and bootstrap quality projects, the Polygon Community Grants Program was launched with 1 billion tokens all for Polygon builders. Season one of the community Grants program is live right now and features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of Polygon projects. For builders on Polygon or projects interested in migrating, these grants are for you. Join the aggregated future and feel empowered to grow in an infinite web of unified interoperable chains apply today at Polygon Technology Grants. I want to go back to the solvers. How are you guys going to onboard solvers Or I guess how? I wanted to ask how do you approach that? And as far as I understand most solvers on most intent networks are run in house currently.
00:18:25.615 - 00:18:34.219, Speaker B: Is this going to be the case for you guys for some time or how do you see this even Working out eventually, I guess. I want also the big picture. Josh, take a bit.
00:18:34.387 - 00:18:54.045, Speaker A: Yeah. So we have just to touch on Aori and then the ecosystem in general. So we have no internal solver right now. Candidly, we outsource 100% of our solving, and I think it's probably going to be that way for a long time. There's nothing precluding us from running a solver, but, like, I don't know. I don't want to get into the algorithmic optimization game. That shit is complicated and really, really hard.
00:18:54.045 - 00:19:23.595, Speaker A: Like, it's really hard. I'll talk a little bit about solvers today as well, and the solver ecosystem in general. So onboarding solvers has been really, really great for a couple of reasons. Number one, all the solver teams are really great. They're really open. They're super happy to integrate because fundamentally, at the end of the day, the way that they make money is getting order flow, and we're another source of order flow, so they want to integrate us. And so it's been really, really, like, easy to onboard solvers and work with them because, like, we do a lot of the tech integration for them.
00:19:23.595 - 00:20:04.875, Speaker A: We really are happy to talk to them and communicate about, like, do we think that they're going to have a shot to win orders on Aori? So we're. We're really above the board with them in terms of keeping everything. Like, you know, we don't want, like, 20 solvers who. And there are some solvers that do this, like, which is kind of insane. Anybody in the audience who's not, like, technically, you know, proficient, you know, like, the. The lowest level, like, the fastest possible coding you can do is in, like, assembly or, like, something really low level, like Rust or C. Like, there are teams that have basically rewritten the entirety of, like, Uniswap in a Rust or C environment so that they can be faster at calculating Uniswap routes than anyone else, like, in Assembly.
00:20:04.875 - 00:20:22.421, Speaker A: And, like, it's. It's insane how hard they're optimizing. Like, there are teams of like, five to 10 people whose whole day job is like, let's shave 10 microseconds off this week of our. Of our quote. And that's not a millisecond. That's not like 1 1,000 of a second. That's 1 1,000th of 1 1,000th of a second.
00:20:22.421 - 00:20:57.849, Speaker A: Like, this is insanely, like, fast quoting, we're talking about. So there are a lot of solvers. They're really, really great teams to Work with like right now, almost all of them, all of them basically are optimizing for generic or sorry, generic swap solving only. So like input token, output token, which I think that will likely be what solvers do forever. I really would be shocked if I saw any kind of intent infrastructure take off that's not just pure swaps over the next like five years at least. Unless something catastrophic changes in the tech. Like there's no way the, the even crop.
00:20:57.849 - 00:21:04.857, Speaker A: Like I'm not even talking about like you know, just pure same chain swaps. Even cross chain swaps will be just swaps or cross chain intents will be swaps. Yeah, depends.
00:21:04.881 - 00:21:31.485, Speaker D: It depends what you're swapping though, right? Like right now crypto is at a phase where swapping anything is with respect to tokens, some sort of financial value. But that token, there's a data structure and there's some information that is being swapped ultimately. And so I don't know, I can imagine a world where like swapping information that isn't necessarily financial tokens exists.
00:21:32.065 - 00:21:34.985, Speaker A: Like what, like what information? I'm curious.
00:21:35.105 - 00:22:05.345, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, this, I don't know, this is like a totally different podcast and no, it's interesting, a different area of exploration. But like you know, right now on the Internet when I'm you know, sign up for Instagram, I'm swapping all sorts of my information about my, you know, who I am and my age and who my phone is connected to and you know, they're able to sort of paint this picture on like who I am and what I might like. None of that information is financial.
00:22:05.765 - 00:22:32.621, Speaker A: I think that'll probably like anything that's, I mean. Yeah, I guess exclusively. Sure at what I'm talking about. So like financial, right? Like for whether it's spot tokens or it's like things like tokenized derivatives, for example, like tokenized options or pers or even even like binary options like bets. Basically what you're describing, like data swapping, I think that they're de. I think that kind of solution already exists. I think it looks like hyperlane or like layer zero, right? Like it looks like a generic messaging protocol.
00:22:32.621 - 00:23:00.017, Speaker A: If it's, if it's like I don't. I'm not trying to get something out, I'm just trying to send some data and maybe I expect some back. I think it'll look like Layer 0 or Hyperlane or like a G or something like that. But like any kind of financial swapping or any kind of like defi protocol will, will likely be solver Based. I don't know if I'd call it like the. I call it like the market makerization of everything. You could maybe call it like the solverization of everything.
00:23:00.017 - 00:23:10.185, Speaker A: I don't know. I need to work on the marketing of this like what this term is going to be called. But like, yeah, I really hope that that's the future. If that's not the future, then we've done something catastrophic wrong.
00:23:10.485 - 00:23:37.405, Speaker B: Yeah, cross chain bridging now has just boiled down to like in intense bridging as well. It's just swaps. I'm swapping Exxon Solana for Exxon Eve. So it's the same thing. And what is the Aori architecture look like? I remember reading that it's based. Why, why did you guys decide to go with a base architecture? What was the primary reason for that and did you consider any alternatives?
00:23:37.865 - 00:24:09.635, Speaker A: There's two things to talk about there. Number one is like cross chain swapping. And two is why is a re based or what does base mean? The first is for the base part, just because that's easier to tackle real quick. I really hate how bastardized the term based has gotten. I don't mean based in terms of posting edgy memes on Twitter for any of the listeners. I mean bases and based sequencing is what we're referring to. Although don't get me wrong, I'm based on Twitter but not like, not like in a sequencing way.
00:24:09.635 - 00:24:48.093, Speaker A: In a sequencing sense. I believe that a app or a roll up is based if what they do is you do some kind of transaction building off chain and then it doesn't. It can be on a blockchain, it can be not on a blockchain, it doesn't matter. But then the transaction gets sequenced to the layer one to interact with or to kind of interact with the layer one. So I think a really good example of a based roll up is open is OpenSea or Blur. I think these are by definition based roll ups. You're building transactions off chain that have multi legged things like signatures for example, or some kind of complicated data structure.
00:24:48.093 - 00:25:23.681, Speaker A: And then whenever some condition gets met, either the maker, the taker, the Blur foundation, the OpenSea foundation, anybody can then take that call data, they can take that transact, then write it to the layer one and actually execute it on chain. So I think that's what a based app is. I think any other definition of it is like probably way too granular. I think it literally should just be. You build your transaction off chain and for your app and then all the Transactions on the app get sequenced on the. Whatever your destination chain is. I don't even say, when I say L1, I don't even just mean like Ethereum.
00:25:23.681 - 00:25:57.267, Speaker A: You could just pick Arbitrum or like Solana or whatever. It doesn't matter. Just like you're settling them in whatever order that the app users want them to be settled on the chain. Right? And the way Aori is based is like that's what we do. We allow you to build the signature off chain, build a transaction off chain and then based on your needs, like, based on how fast you need that transaction settled, it then gets settled directly to the layer 1. The second part that's like kind of tied in is like cross chain bridging and like what cross chain bridging and infrastructure looks like in general. I think like going back to like the solverization of everything.
00:25:57.267 - 00:26:49.753, Speaker A: Like, I think I really would be shocked if there was a cross chain bridging protocol that exists in like a year or two. I mean, maybe they'll exist, but like they won't be the majority of cross chain volume. I think what will probably happen is apps will do dedicated deals with private market makers or private solvers that have liquidity and they will directly tap into them to provide them quotes for whatever token they need in whatever format they need on destination chains. And I think that's actually probably better because I think what that means is you'll have this very open competitive market to capture each app's order flow by these solvers and market makers for cross chain order flow. And that means that the end users are going to get better pricing. It means you don't have to do these things, like these convoluted, like auction mechanisms for some of them. Like, I really think, like, that's probably what it's going to look like.
00:26:49.849 - 00:27:05.335, Speaker D: But what, but what happened to defi? What happened to open transparent finance? Like, what you're describing kind of sounds like tradfi all over again. It just sounds like you're. It's market making in a traditional sense.
00:27:06.275 - 00:27:31.111, Speaker A: It is, but it isn't. Because what we're doing is we're. If you, if you just, if something just has the association of. There's this like, you know, kind of concept of like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Right? Like, kind of. Just because, you know, just because the bathwater is bad doesn't mean you should throw the baby out the window too. Right? I think just because tradfi is bad because it's centralized does not mean that we can't learn from it and take a la carte, the best parts of it.
00:27:31.111 - 00:28:12.379, Speaker A: And I think what TRADFI got right, that we are way too arrogant as an industry to accept is they got trading right. They got trading right. There was 500 years from the creation of the Dutch East India Company's ipo. Even the Romans had like stock markets, right? Like there's a lot of cool papers on this and like stuff. They had like a very sophisticated stock market that was almost as sophisticated as like you know, pit trading like the 1990s. Like it's really, there's really cool stuff on this. Like trading is a solved game like continuous limit order books effectively or continuous continuous limit limit order markets are like, you know, the most efficient for any kind of liquid asset and auctions are the most efficient for price discovery of illiquid assets.
00:28:12.379 - 00:28:56.967, Speaker A: Like this is kind of like known economists have known this for a long time. There's great papers on this. So we should not be trying to reinvent that. What we should be trying to reinvent is the settlement and storage of all data relating to ownership of assets. That is where like we should be trying to decentralize what's called the clearing corporation at the cme, not the cme. Like people don't know this but like there's the life cycle of a trade in tradfi goes exchange and then at the end of every day they take all the trades that happened on the exchange and they send them to the clearing corp. And then the clearing corp then nets everyone's trades out and they say okay, here's all the balance changes that need to happen and then they send those to like your what are called custodians.
00:28:56.967 - 00:29:29.317, Speaker A: So that's like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, BNY Mellon. These are like basically banks that are just holding on to stock certificates for you at the end of the day. And so what we should be trying to decentralize is the second and third tier of execution, not the first tier. If we can use things like signatures, for example, we're even able to capture the majority of the decentralization in that. Like unless you actually your private key and public key signed for that trade. Like that trade can't even hit the clearing layer. Like so I would say like right now, Aori for example.
00:29:29.317 - 00:29:53.005, Speaker A: And like this is true. I'm not going to just say this about Aori. I'll be fair to competitors. This is true of COW swap, this is true of Uniswap X. This is true of any signature based platform is we basically have the same trust assumptions that a centralized sequencer has. We can censor your orders, but we can't edit them. We can't settle them without your permission because your private key is the one that signed for this.
00:29:53.005 - 00:30:15.295, Speaker A: That means unless your private key signs for an edit or a cancel or anything like that, that trait can't clear. What we should be working on and innovating on now is probably things that look like censorship resistant solutions. Things like tes, for example, I think are like a good, good path down here. But there are problems with TEs, but there are other ideas with censorship resistance stuff with like AVS's and whatnot too. But. Sorry, I'm rambling, but yeah, no, I.
00:30:15.375 - 00:30:48.625, Speaker D: Really like that analogy. I really like that analogy. You present with the exchanges and then there's this clearing house and this whole supply chain and yeah, I agree. Like there's a way that we could adapt these traditional models in a way that presents all of these things that we don't normally have like access to or we don't normally have the ability to observe these relationships so that we can make informed decisions as market participants. You know, making that more available for everyone for sure is I think, a really good North Star to keep, keep, you know, walking toward.
00:30:51.765 - 00:30:54.425, Speaker B: Roy. I think this one's a bit more for you.
00:30:56.455 - 00:31:00.735, Speaker C: I'm realizing maybe I should have let Josh take this one on his own.
00:31:00.895 - 00:31:26.507, Speaker B: No, it's good, special, I guess I want to understand who the main. Well, this one's actually two pronged. But the first one is who are the main users of aori? And I don't mean like apart from obviously me, you, all of us, but. And what's the current go to market? Obviously you want regular retail users, but is there somebody else that you're specifically focusing on?
00:31:26.611 - 00:32:08.355, Speaker C: Yeah. So to answer your question on who the users are, on one end we've got takers, which I think Josh defined very well. Those are mostly institutionals, market makers, high frequency trading, anyone with a large liquid book. And so that I would say is the institutional side of things. And on the other side we're deploying front ends which will look, I think, very, very clean. And I'm spending a lot of time now trying to get people to use it and test it out so that we can improve it before we officially announce that it's actually live. And on that side it's going to be very much retail or anyone who would ever interact with a dex or an aggregator, et cetera, to do any form of swap.
00:32:08.355 - 00:33:14.425, Speaker C: So to answer your question. Both retail and institutional. And I guess on the go to market side of things, it's really just very much user driven. And I don't mean to be the meme of, you know, for users, by users, but it's effectively we have a set of clients that are already onboarded and it's a question of hey, where do you guys want to trade the most? And that's how we'll form, where we launch first from the institutional side of things. Right now on the user side, it's, it's really just, hey Buck, can you come try this? What do you think? How do we improve it? Because though we trade and you know, I mean, you know that I dabble in shitcoining here and there so I can, you know, extrapolate what I would want, but that doesn't necessitate that that's what Magic would want or what Josh would want or what you might want. So it's very much trying to get a lot of feedback on the fly and just reiterating and reiterating and reiterating till we're comfortable and then even then trying to improve it further. That's on the go to market side of your questions.
00:33:14.425 - 00:33:33.765, Speaker C: Now why I asked when this is launching is we're also working on another retail product which I won't delve too much into, but that's going to be primarily retail focused. And so that's where trying to get retail users will be very, very helpful and sort of create a nice flywheel of order flow for us.
00:33:33.925 - 00:33:42.045, Speaker B: That makes sense. And specifically, I guess on the taker side, what does that look like? How do you, I guess, have like.
00:33:44.065 - 00:34:28.501, Speaker C: Yeah, well, so thankfully, you know, the team is very much from a market making background, so they've already got a lot of connects in that space, which has made my life quite easy on that front. But otherwise it's, you know, going after these new liquid books. A lot of VCs who have turned into really long only hedge funds who manage their own books, you know, going to them and asking them what, what would they need? You know, whether it's a tee wap which, which is very obvious or other sorts of features but attracting them. You know, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of these books are very secretive. They don't want to be known and so that's a little more tricky and, and something I'm trying to maneuver very, you know, niftily on how do I find these people so that I can onboard them.
00:34:28.653 - 00:34:30.785, Speaker B: That makes sense. Josh, do you have anything you want to add?
00:34:31.205 - 00:35:35.575, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say like, like, yeah, a lot of what we're always talking about is like what we're doing now. But I think like it's important to know that like our long term vision is that like this is how all trading will, will work in the next like several years in DeFi, like I think we're kind of really focused on building infrastructure for trading, infrastructure for any kind of settlement that needs to occur. And that's really kind of what we're, what we're, what our kind of vision is is that like swapping, trading, defi protocols in general in the future will look a lot different. They'll look, they'll be effectively these kind of based applications built on top of signature swaps and things like that much more so than they exist now in these like really kind of crude, let's jam everything into a smart contract possible. And so I think like our takers, for example, like we use the term taker now but like these will just be DEFI users in the future. This is what defi like I think will look like is basically having you know, these just pure intentions that you're where you're where you're working with and all of the execution, routing, optimization, all of that occurs in like a very open and competitive marketplace between solvers.
00:35:36.675 - 00:36:31.203, Speaker D: I want to double tap on your definition of based because I think it's really interesting. I think that your definition is much different than the definition that I think people use in, you know, on, you know, these, where people have these conversations. Can we double tap on that? And I guess we'll maybe try to like, I'll just try to summarize what you've, what you've said and correct me if I'm wrong. Based on like your definition, you think that it's a base roll up. Ara is a base roll up. Not because there's some L1 proposer who does the sequencing. It's that the Aori settles on the L1 where the proposer receives the sequence of Aori transactions.
00:36:31.203 - 00:36:49.895, Speaker D: So in a sense that like, in a sense like you guys are sort of sequencing or there's some solver or market maker who sequences this like opportunity and then that gets posted onto L1 and the proposer isn't doing that sequencing, it's just stamping like okay, this is what we're receiving.
00:36:51.115 - 00:37:33.559, Speaker A: I think like you're kind of, just to be more specific, like in my definition of based, it's very, very generic. So I would almost say like a really good way to look at what I think of as based is basically a private mempool. It's like you could really view Aori as like a private mempool, for example, or like even cow swap. Like, basically you're doing all of your transaction building in this, you know, off chain, isolated area where call data and transactions are being built. And then when conditions are met, they then can be sequenced to the layer one. Now an app can add any rules they want to the proposer of that transaction on the L1. So like, you know, the way cow swap does it is they say that like cow swap settles all the transactions.
00:37:33.559 - 00:38:39.235, Speaker A: They don't even let the solvers settle the transaction. So the solvers send their call data and then cowswap is the one who actually executes that transaction on the layer one directly. We do it in a much more, I guess, you know, open manner where we basically, like once an order has been matched, we publicly announce that order to everyone in the E, everybody who's listening to our API, anybody can settle the transaction. And so that means that depending on whoever, whichever counterparty of that trade, the maker or the taker, depending on how fast they, they need that transaction settled, they can propose that transaction to the layer one in whatever kind of time format or block format, like whenever they need that transaction settled. So I would view a based application as basically saying you do your transaction building off chain and then you allow the execution and the proposing of that transaction to the L1 validators or whatever the val, whatever the, you know, sequencing structure is of the chain that you're pushing, you basically allow it to then settle directly to that chain. So I would look at it more like I would think of base sequencing basically as a rewriting of the old term private mempool, basically.
00:38:40.135 - 00:38:43.383, Speaker D: Okay, interesting, interesting. I'll have to go back to the.
00:38:43.399 - 00:38:45.075, Speaker A: Drawing circle or something.
00:38:48.415 - 00:38:52.275, Speaker B: Josh, I was going to ask you about tees and why you brought them up.
00:38:52.735 - 00:39:42.285, Speaker A: I just think they're really, really interesting. I think any way that you can basically have this. So if you view a blockchain is a distributed execution environment. So it's this distributed execution environment that every node is running and then you have your data stored on that node and we all agree, based on these different consensus algorithms, to then agree on which transactions to include and which ones not to include or whatever. Right. A TEE is just a really interesting concept of how you basically build verifiably censorship or a verifiably, you know, censorship resistant slash, like a computing environment that has like some of the capabilities of a blockchain that only exists on one computer. I think that's a pretty cool idea.
00:39:42.285 - 00:40:10.385, Speaker A: So I don't think, like, I'm not like a TE Maxi or anything, but like, I think tes are pretty cool. And like, they open up like, for example, like we can run the. A reorder book, for example, on like a distributed set of TEs and then let people connect to whichever one's closest to them. For example, like, there's just. It just. It's a really cool way to do computing or to do like basically get some of the properties of a decentralized network on one box, which is like something that has not been possible previously.
00:40:10.965 - 00:40:35.115, Speaker B: No, I completely agree. And I feel like I'm seeing a lot more talk on TES on the timeline over the past few weeks at least. I feel like the one question that I haven't asked yet is why? And I know you have very, very strong opinions on this is why you guys are building, I guess limit orders as intense as opposed to AMMs. Yeah, that's really it.
00:40:35.455 - 00:40:39.423, Speaker A: AMMS are. You guys allow swearing on your platform.
00:40:39.519 - 00:40:41.255, Speaker B: Yeah, you can say whatever you want.
00:40:41.335 - 00:41:01.271, Speaker A: They're fucking stupid. They're fucking stupid. Like, I mean, like, look, I get why they exist. Like, like all things that are considered dumb in hindsight. They were smart at one point. Point, right? And I think like AMMS were really smart for basically you could really think of an AMM as like an auction more than anything. More than even like an order book, let's say.
00:41:01.271 - 00:41:32.527, Speaker A: Like, I won't get too deep into the technical weeds on this, but like when AMMS got started, the only thing that was being traded on them was like these illiquid coins that like nobody could get listed on Binance or Coinbase or whatever. It was like, I, I can't get it. I don't have a plug with Binance, so I might as well just list it on Uniswap, for example, example. Right? Like, that was the whole reason they got started. And that's like a really valid use case for an amm. I think that's a great idea. When, when price discovery is occurring on an amm, that's but the moment on an AMM that you start trading something that's more liquid somewhere else.
00:41:32.527 - 00:42:11.631, Speaker A: Like you are basically just letting. You are basically just screwing your users. And like, I won't, I won't like call out who, but like the, some of the people, some of the actors who really shill AMMs have done some of the most like genuinely Despicable things in crypto, like research and in crypto analytics in general, like publishing papers like that basically deny things like impermanent loss exist. Things that deny that like, arbitrage or LVR exists on these AMMs. Like, that's the kind of stuff I really hate. And so, like, I'm a very, like, I don't know, tenacious person. And like, you know, whenever I see something that's not good, I like to call it out.
00:42:11.631 - 00:42:39.967, Speaker A: And then when I see, like, people who are being really, really malicious for whatever bags that they're holding and they're denying that something malicious is happening, like, I want to call them out on that immediately. And so that's what, like, a lot of my problem with AMMs. Like, I don't have a problem with the philosophical concept of an amm, right? Like, just like, I don't have a problem with the, you know, the concept of, like, I don't know, fucking Plato or something, man. But like, don't lie to me about it. Don't lie. Like, don't lie. That's bad.
00:42:39.967 - 00:43:26.237, Speaker A: And I like to. One thing I like to really pride myself on, it's like, when I see somebody like, lying, I'm gonna call, I'm gonna call it out. And so I think, like, a lot of the discourse around trading in crypto has been done by people that don't understand anything about trading in crypto and, or, and, or they do understand and they're trying to, they're trying to scam you. And so that's why, like, I, I feel like I'm a spokesman for the LPs. Like, I want to be, I want to be the voice of the unheard of the, of the LPs of these AMMs and these, these, these, these platforms. And so, like, yeah, lend. Lend me your, Lend me your, your LP assets and I'll stop you getting absolutely reamed by like five trading firms that are like, frontrunning you.
00:43:26.237 - 00:43:43.489, Speaker A: I had a tweet one time that like, a lot of guys, like, a lot of my friends like to make fun of. I was like, I was like, you're getting front ran, back ran and butt fucked. And like, you know, I really want to protect, protect the, the LPs from, from those three events occurring to them consensually, at least. Non consensually. Right?
00:43:43.617 - 00:44:14.851, Speaker B: Like, so, yeah, that makes sense. I, I think I want to ask two questions. First is, one thing that you touched upon is that AMMs were originally built to be able to trade coins like a liquid Coins on them. You guys have permissionless asset trading, which is cool, but I don't. I guess what I'm wondering is how do you, I guess incentivize solvers to pick up these orders and to fill them? Like, is there no risk for them to keep or. Because they're just doing it?
00:44:14.883 - 00:44:15.455, Speaker C: Like.
00:44:16.675 - 00:44:28.307, Speaker A: No, no. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. You have more for the question. So here's. Okay. Solving is inherent. So like solving today is market making without taking any risk.
00:44:28.307 - 00:44:56.949, Speaker A: I'll give a little like, like TLDR for the listeners who aren't familiar with much of market making. Like market making or I guess solving today to start with solving and look why it's. Solving is super, super easy. Like solvers do not take any risk whatsoever. Right now, not in the future, but right now, Right now what they do is they basically, they run an algorithm. They find you the best possible, you know, route. Like I'm going to break up your trade through these 15 different pools and you get the best possible number of tokens out.
00:44:56.949 - 00:45:28.951, Speaker A: We're all very familiar with this. That's super common. That is what is called like market making routing basically using algorithms that market makers use all the time to basically find you the best possible output price. This is super, super common in trading. This kind of strategy of basically optimized routing effectively through different exchanges. Solvers right now do it all atomically. So that means like the solver takes your assets, routes them through all these AMMs and all these pools on chain and then returns you the tokens in one transaction.
00:45:28.951 - 00:46:16.233, Speaker A: So they're never holding any inventory or any risk. Market making is like doing that but actually holding the inventory and taking the risk. And so you're not, you're not able to do it atomically. Like I'm filling an order on Binance and then I have to fill that order on Coinbase and execute that hedge or I'm going to lose money. And so yeah, I think that's like the way we basically handle the solver, solver risk side of things is like solvers right now are doing everything atomically but like in the future and you're starting to see this a little bit on like Cow Swap and Uniswap X. And like a lot of these like more mature solving platforms is market makers are now coming in and filling, filling solutions using proprietary liquidity. So they're like, they're not routing your trade through a bunch of pools.
00:46:16.233 - 00:46:38.435, Speaker A: They're just, they have a bunch of assets in a wallet and then they just basically will quote the price on Binance plus a couple of basis points of profit and then fill that order on the, on the, you know, the platform that you, whatever, wherever they got that trade from, for example. So I think. Yeah, that's, it's an interesting rabbit hole, but yeah, sorry if I didn't answer.
00:46:39.375 - 00:46:44.915, Speaker B: No, it's perfect. Eventually you see more and more, I guess, solvers become market makers.
00:46:45.575 - 00:46:49.435, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that was. Yeah, sorry.
00:46:49.815 - 00:46:53.435, Speaker B: Just because of efficiency, because they'll be able to source it for cheaper.
00:46:53.775 - 00:47:32.775, Speaker A: It's, it's actually just a, it's a risk tolerance threshold really. Right. Because like what it basically, I think like any solver that doesn't start to invest heavily in understanding how to do things like inventory management and hedging is going to get left behind. I think as we move away from a world where liquidity is stored on chain and market makers are on chain via like AMMs and on chain clubs, we're going to look. The world will look more and more like centralized exchanges with decentralized settlement and clearing in custody. And so that means solvers are going. The term solver is probably going to disappear.
00:47:32.775 - 00:47:56.729, Speaker A: It will just turn. It'll basically get merged into market making. And this is not like one tiny little annoying asterisk is like crypto is kind of fucked in the definition of market making crypto, people think market making means doing arbitrage. That's not what market making is. That's not market making at all. That's just arbing. Like arbitrage is not a market making activity.
00:47:56.729 - 00:48:26.187, Speaker A: Like maybe a market maker makes a little bit of profit in tradfi off of arbitrage, but it's like, you know, pennies compared to what they make. Doing actual market making. Market making is, I am going to be the best. I'm going to be a one. I'm going to have buy orders and I'm going to have sell orders in the market at all times, whether or not I can hedge. And I'm going to price the risk I have of holding these assets accordingly. So like, I think the best way to describe what a market maker does, like, I love this analogy.
00:48:26.187 - 00:48:54.483, Speaker A: Like, basically my trading mentor who traded at the Chicago Merck for like 25 years told me, gave me this analogy and it explains market making in like the most elegant way possible. Market makers are just used car salesmen. That's all they are. And so like, what this means basically is Joe comes to me in the morning and says, like, hey, I got to sell this car. This car. The fair value of this car, according to my estimation as a used car dealer, is $2,000. And I say, already, I'll buy that car from you right now for 1900.
00:48:54.483 - 00:49:10.609, Speaker A: So I'm getting. I'm buying his car for a hundred dollars cheaper than the fair value of it because he needs to sell it right now. And I'm like, okay. He's like, already? Because you'll buy it from me right now. I'll give it to you at a discount. So I'll give it to you for 1900. And so I, as the used car dealer, hold that car.
00:49:10.609 - 00:49:33.873, Speaker A: I'm taking the risk of that car declining in value. So let's say the car stays $2,000 for that whole day. At the very end of the day, you know, Joe Schmo, not Joe. I'm using two Joes. Adam comes to me at the end of the day and says, I want to buy that car. And I say, alrighty, that'll be $2,100. And he's like, what? That car is only worth 2,000.
00:49:33.873 - 00:50:01.495, Speaker A: I'm like, you need it right now, though, don't you? And he's like, yeah, I need it right now. And I'm like, alrighty, well, you're going to pay me 2100 for it. And so when he pays me 2100, I'm netting $200 of profit. And so that is what a market maker does in tradfi. A market maker is somebody who's saying, I am always going to be here to buy and sell this no matter what. And they're going to. They're going to take haircuts off of your, you know, order because you're basically paying them to always be there for you for s liquidity.
00:50:01.495 - 00:50:08.545, Speaker A: And I think solvers will have to adjust to being arbors to being market makers.
00:50:10.765 - 00:50:51.765, Speaker D: I want to definitely reopen the AMM tab that Boccaccio, you know, presented. I definitely want to revisit some of the concepts there. Well, first of all, the way I think about Aori is, you know, more market structure, more defi. Market structure, which I think is a great thing, like solvers being able to take more risk given this market structure. I think that's, you know, a really potentially valuable piece of infrastructure. The part where I'm going to push back is on this notion that AMM suck. And the reason why is because I think AMMs are supposed to be dumb.
00:50:51.765 - 00:51:29.377, Speaker D: I don't think they're supposed to be these, like, super sophisticated, like, vehicles or structures that super Sophisticated kidded, like market makers are going to use. I think AMMs are, are supposed to be dumb. And so I think that classification is, is, is not like properly used when we think about AMMs. And I think crypto has a habit of like using these fancy terms for, you know, things that might not necessarily look like that in the short term. For example, AMMS is one. We're not necessarily market making. It's just these passive investors holding two assets that rebalance over time.
00:51:29.377 - 00:51:43.529, Speaker D: That looks very much like an ETF. Another term is DAOs. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. DAOs are not, you know, decentralized. Maybe some are. And when they are, that's. These coordination systems fall apart.
00:51:43.529 - 00:52:05.253, Speaker D: They're definitely not autonomous either. There has to be some level of communication. So I just want to like revisit the AMMs because I feel as if like the space doesn't necessarily classify them correctly. And so I'm curious your thoughts on that classification and whether that like, could potentially update your perspective on a Ms.
00:52:05.429 - 00:52:32.263, Speaker A: So, so I, I definitely, like, I definitely get your point. I will say this. Like, as earlier I described when I said I don't hate AMMs, I hate the people that lie about AMMs. I think like, AMMs are just a tool at the end of the day, right? Like, like, I can't. It would be stupid of me to be like, I hate hammers because I like screwdrivers. You know, it like, makes no sense, right? Like you need a hammer when you need a hammer. You need a screwdriver when you need a screwdriver, right? The.
00:52:32.263 - 00:53:08.509, Speaker A: My. The place that I think AMMs can be valuable is basically the same place that like auctions can be valuable. When you have an asset that you don't know the fair value of it and you need some kind of natural price discovery to occur in this isolated market, then yes, I can understand having AMMs be, be these things that like, need to be used and need to be like, more creatively used. The problem is people go around and act like they're the best thing since sliced bread and they're like, we need to use this for all trading at all times. And I'm just like, what the are you talking about? Like, no, that's stupid. Like, so, so that's my only, like, caveat to what you said.
00:53:08.587 - 00:53:11.565, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I agree, I agree with that. 100.
00:53:13.145 - 00:53:13.905, Speaker A: Sweet. Sweet.
00:53:13.985 - 00:53:19.184, Speaker B: All right, so we shot on AMMS enough. What do you think is the future of LPing and AMMs? Hold on.
00:53:19.256 - 00:53:48.215, Speaker D: I'm not, I'm not shooting on AMMs. I, I think that AMMs, if DeFi, if DEFI has done, has brought like, you know, sort of going back to an early point. I, I also think that there's a lot of value from learning from traditional finance, like, you know, adapting these concepts and figuring out how to apply them in DeFi. But if there's one like, purely defi application that we've created, it's amms. And I think there's a lot of value in that.
00:53:48.635 - 00:53:53.771, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I would say perps and money markets are much cooler, in my opinion. Like, I think, I mean, money markets.
00:53:53.803 - 00:53:56.259, Speaker D: Not money markets and futures, they.
00:53:56.307 - 00:53:56.891, Speaker C: They exist.
00:53:56.963 - 00:54:00.897, Speaker D: Derivatives and money markets, those are structures, those are products that.
00:54:00.971 - 00:54:14.213, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, but. But what is it? Okay, okay, I'll like, dunk on AMMs then. Okay. An AMM is just an order book with rules. That's it. It's an order book where the, the only rule is that there's one market maker and that market maker has a predefined price function.
00:54:14.213 - 00:54:31.802, Speaker A: That's. I mean, that's. An AMM is not like, like when you, when you break it down, it is. It is an order book where you have basically continuous limit orders. They're not technically continuous because math and solidity is discrete. Well, in, in part in the solidity that like, AMMs are written in.
00:54:31.915 - 00:54:41.103, Speaker D: But yeah, Uniswap V3 is that Uniswap V2. And you know, for example, Uniswap 2 Balancer.
00:54:41.199 - 00:54:42.711, Speaker A: These aren't limit order books.
00:54:42.823 - 00:54:43.607, Speaker D: These are just.
00:54:43.711 - 00:55:15.755, Speaker A: Yes, they technically are. Because. Because every single. Like, it is, if you think about it in the terms of, like, one side of the pool is the bid side and one side of the pool is the ask side. You basically just have what looks a lot like, you know, a standard market maker, where it's basically saying, I'm going to provide this level of price of liquidity at this price and at this price and at this price and at this price. V3 just gives you the ability to. Instead of having to post your limit your range on the whole spectrum, you can post it on a section of the spectrum.
00:55:15.755 - 00:55:18.495, Speaker A: That's the only difference between V2 and V3, in my opinion.
00:55:19.435 - 00:55:22.323, Speaker D: I think we have different perspectives on what AMMs are.
00:55:22.379 - 00:55:23.347, Speaker A: Hey, it's all good.
00:55:23.491 - 00:55:25.925, Speaker D: We should definitely un. Practice like in another time.
00:55:26.005 - 00:55:28.825, Speaker A: Opinions are like, everybody's got one. No.
00:55:31.765 - 00:55:34.545, Speaker D: I don't know what to say after that. I, I just. I don't know.
00:55:35.205 - 00:55:49.445, Speaker B: I'm gonna say it. Josh. What I. We have. Because I'm Cognizant that you have to go. So I'm going to run through relatively quickly. I'm gonna ignore the LPing and AMM question, even though I wanted your take on it.
00:55:49.445 - 00:55:50.829, Speaker B: We have to ignore it now.
00:55:50.877 - 00:55:53.517, Speaker C: But he can write you a thread on it.
00:55:53.661 - 00:55:55.301, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I'll write you a thread. Or jump on again.
00:55:55.333 - 00:55:56.421, Speaker B: I'll write you a thread.
00:55:56.573 - 00:55:57.345, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:58.245 - 00:56:08.821, Speaker B: This one's also for you, Roya. But what's the end goal vision for Aori? What is the full suite of Aori products look like? And what is the ideal experience that you guys want from the user?
00:56:08.973 - 00:56:12.661, Speaker A: I'll give like a quick one and then, Roy, feel free to jump in. Well, maybe, maybe, maybe.
00:56:12.773 - 00:56:15.797, Speaker C: I don't even think I'm qualified to answer this. Josh. Josh, the founder.
00:56:15.861 - 00:56:16.665, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
00:56:18.085 - 00:56:19.651, Speaker C: To try and help him get there.
00:56:19.733 - 00:56:51.575, Speaker A: So if there's anything I missed, feel free to jump in. Like I talked a little bit about this earlier. Like, like the vision is Aori is the. It's a. Whether it's a Ori or it's just the fact that we build the tooling for it. It's that all DEFI applications that are not, you know, things like, like what we talked about earlier that are just like, basically just data passing. All financial defi applications move to intent infrastructure like Aori, where you basically have, you know, a, you have a predefined end goal that you want for something to occur and where are the rails that you do it through.
00:56:51.575 - 00:57:41.859, Speaker A: And I think, like, that's really what my dream is for, like the future of DEFI to look like is to look like you have an open. You know, the problem with Tradfi is not like the trading structure of like order books or anything like that. I think the problem with TradFi is that to be a market maker in TradFi, you have to have hundreds of millions of dollars, you have to have licenses, you have to have like regulator friends, you have to be part of SROs, you have to be part of. There's so much fixed cost. The price of being a DEFI market maker is, hey, are you really good at writing algorithms that are optimized or do you have like some kind of belief of the market that no one else has? And I think that's incredibly beautiful. And like, my dream is not that we have 50 million different AMM competitors against each other. My dream is that like, we have this very basic concept of an intent or a swap or anything like that.
00:57:41.859 - 00:57:55.655, Speaker A: And we basically allow a super open and competitive market of market makers to be able to compete and provide liquidity for whatever the end goal the user wants. And so that's really kind of what I. What I dream AI is, is the infrastructure to make that possible.
00:57:55.995 - 00:58:00.931, Speaker B: That was pretty good, Roy. I kind of don't want you to add anything in because that was really, really good. Thanks, man.
00:58:00.963 - 00:58:02.615, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Thanks for having us.
