00:00:03.050 - 00:00:15.280, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We have a bonus episode for you this week. We are speaking with the founder of Infinity Pools, one of the founders, Machu. And it's great to have you on Machu. How are you doing today?
00:00:15.730 - 00:00:18.094, Speaker B: Not too bad, thanks. Awesome.
00:00:18.292 - 00:00:46.726, Speaker A: Yeah, you've guys been talking town of all of crypto Twitter over the past couple days. So super excited to have you on and kind of peel back what infinity pools can really do for the perps landscape. And so that's probably a great place to start, is when you look out into defi and centralized exchanges as well. What does the perps landscape look like to you? And then maybe if you could end that conversation with what did you think could be optimized? And how did that lead you to building infinity pools?
00:00:46.838 - 00:01:55.380, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So I also want to give a little bit of context, which is that infinite pools was actually built by the same team that built finance. You know, about a year or so ago, we were the first protocol to build out a stablecoin backed by perps and a perp short position, or what they call delta neutral, like perp position. So initially, we were very bullish on perps in general coming into the space. I had an entire thesis about derivatives blowing up in crypto and really kind of doing the same ratio of volume that they do in traditional finance, or CFI. Right. So if you look at sex today, spot is a 10th of the volume that goes on derivatives, and specifically perps are at least an order of magnitude bigger in size.
00:01:55.380 - 00:03:19.990, Speaker B: That was kind of my thesis going in, that derivatives would come in and essentially do the same thing, and perps would just grow to be like this massive ten x bigger opportunity than whatever uniswap, one inch, et cetera, et cetera, did. And obviously, that thesis today kind of came alive. But I want to say it's probably not as much as I expected, and the growth was not what expected and was a little disappointing. And I think really the main reason behind that and the reason that I've kind of calibrated my pieces going forward is that Uniswap was not popular and didn't get all of this attention because it was spot trading on chain. They solved a real UX problem, which was that they offered access to spot trading for the long tail of assets, and they listed those assets ten x faster. Right. So it had nothing to do with it's on chain and transparent.
00:03:19.990 - 00:04:50.650, Speaker B: Those are all fantastic things. But in the end, the reason that it got so popular was because they offered a ten x improvement on two fronts, which was speed of listing and number of assets over its CFI competitors. Now, unfortunately, I kind of expected the same thing to happen with perps, right, where an innovation would allow for perps on the long tail of assets, et cetera, et cetera. Unfortunately, when you're dealing with oracles, and specifically oracles on the long tail of assets, you're going to get wrecked. I mean, just oracle manipulation on the long tail of assets is a surefire way to essentially wreck everyone involved, like both traders and lps and perps essentially do rely on oracles, which means that long tail assets are never going to have perps. And it was also quite a sad realization for us too, right? Because once again, we were built on top of, we really believed in perps at the time, but we didn't see that ten X innovation. Essentially that we didn't see any ten X improvements over what we saw in CFI.
00:04:50.650 - 00:05:58.394, Speaker B: What we saw was just a copying and pasting of perps that lived in CFI on chain. Unfortunately, it just offered a worse experience then. I don't know why professional serious traders would have a worse experience with no ten x improvements. That's basically why about six, seven months ago, we really started researching what we could do to mitigate this problem. And essentially what we ended up finding out was that infinity pools was not only a ten X improvement in the same way that Uniswap was with perps. Right. So not only could we offer leverage on the long tail of assets, offer that leverage ten x faster than any other exchange could, but we could actually offer also ten x larger leverage than any other CFI exchange.
00:05:58.394 - 00:06:38.330, Speaker B: We could offer no liquidations, which resulted in ten x better expected returns for traders and no counterparty risk, which after the past year, I'm sure a lot more people appreciate. So that's kind of like the story about how infinity pools came to mean. I've got an entire spiel about perps and why they have some shortcomings themselves. But I want to pause and see if you guys have any questions before I continue on my rant.
00:06:38.910 - 00:06:45.230, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely, you can keep on going. I think this is exactly like what we want to hear, so keep on telling the story.
00:06:45.380 - 00:08:35.422, Speaker B: That's great. Okay, cool. So that was my main qualm, I think, with perps in DeFi, but then I had an entirely other set of qualms with perps in general as a financial instrument, not only in DeFi, but also in traditional finance. And in the end, perps operate in the same way that margin trading works in traditional finance, right? And they're really bound by the same restriction. Essentially, all of the problems that perps, margin trading and traditional finance, et cetera, et cetera, all of their constraints, all of their shortcomings, all can be traced down to a single thing, which is liquidation risk. What I mean by that is that the problems that I'm talking about are, number one, limited leverage, right? So you only have up to whatever, like 100 x in crypto, but whatever much lower levels in traditional finance, you have not that many assets, right? Just like the long tail of assets, once again, is not possible to be brought on perps. And then you've got obviously some counterparty risk via the forced settlement of markets, right? So this is when somebody's position doesn't get liquidated fast enough, and all of a sudden the market that, that it was in starts to accumulate enough bad debt that the insurance fund of the underlying decks can't cover it, and the market essentially has to be paused.
00:08:35.422 - 00:09:40.454, Speaker B: Traders that were on the profitable side of the trade don't get paid out. And it actually happens a lot more often than you would think anyways. So all of these problems, they actually not only exist in crypto and specifically CFI, but they actually also exist in traditional finance with margin trading. Right, because margin trading still has liquidations. Right. Like the way the margin trading works is that you borrow cash, you take that cash to essentially buy an asset, and then in case your position goes under, you still need to essentially liquidate that asset. But the usage of liquidity for spot trading is very competitive, and so being able to liquidate very large spot positions immediately and before there is a big price move is expensive, and it's not a surefire way to actually get things done.
00:09:40.454 - 00:10:40.794, Speaker B: Well, so basically there are all these problems, once again can all be traced back to a single thing, which is liquidations. And so we started thinking about, okay, well, how do we get rid of liquidations? And turns out there is a fantastic thing that already exists in DeFi, which is liquidity provisioning. Right. What liquidity provisioning is at a super high level is that you have people, liquidity providers, that are willing to suffer impermanent loss, or Il, as I'll start calling it going forward. And what that Il is that they're willing to accept the worst of two assets. Right. And you simplify that a little further and it actually becomes essentially a great way to liquidate assets without liquidating them.
00:10:40.794 - 00:12:03.060, Speaker B: And I'll get a little bit more into why that is, but maybe I want to start with a very concrete example of how the protocol works and then I can get into more high level ways to think about it. So the classic example that I like to give people about how infinity pools works is in a simple eth USDC pool, right? And by the way, this kind of assumes that you have some basic knowledge of how liquidity provisioning in uniswap d free works. So I'll just leave that to the listener to read up on before I continue. So once again, you have an eFusDc pool. Market price of ethereum is 1000 USDC. And let's say that you have a tick at the $900 range, right? So like the liquidity provider comes in and provides liquidity at the 900 USDC range. And all of that liquidity is deployed on a single tick and is worth 1000 USDC, right? So the liquidity provider takes 1000 USDC of their own assets and deploys them at $900.
00:12:03.060 - 00:13:01.030, Speaker B: In return they get an LP token. Now let's say that a trader comes in and borrows that LP token. What they can do is that they can redeem that LP token for the reserves backing it, which is the thousand USDC, and essentially take that thousand USDC that's backing it and swap those reserves for one ethereum. Because once again, the market price of Ethereum at that point is $1,000. Now the interesting thing here, by the way, is that the trader can use any dex, any aggregator to actually swap that 1000 USDC that they borrowed for the one Ethereum. And it's just kind of like a cool property that I'll talk about more. But essentially because this is an atomic transaction, you can use any aggregator or something like uniswap.
00:13:01.030 - 00:14:07.340, Speaker B: So now the trader has one ethereum on their balance sheet and you have two scenarios. Price goes up, price goes down. So price goes up scenario is a lot easier to digest. Let's say the price goes up to Ethereum. Trader can take their one ethereum and sell it for 1500 USDC. Now with those 1500 USDC, the trader can take $500 in profit and then use the remaining 1000 USDC to mint back the LP token at the $900 range at the $900 tick and essentially make the liquidity provider hold, right? So they pay back their debt plus interest, right? So that's all debt as well as well scenario. Obviously things get a lot more interesting when the trader loses money.
00:14:07.340 - 00:15:36.694, Speaker B: So let's say that the price of Ethereum falls to $900. So right above the liquidity range hasn't quite crossed it yet the liquidity provider is still expecting back 1000 USDC, right? Because the liquidity range has not been crossed. So what happens at that point is that the trader can only sell their Ethereum for their one ethereum for $900, so they're in the hole for $100. So let's call that the max loss at $900. Now, the interesting thing and the entire concept, I don't know if that's the best way to put it, but that really allows us to cap the losses and offer the unlimited leverage. Is that below $900, once the liquidity threshold, once the liquidity range of the underlying LP is crossed, the liquidity provider is no longer expecting back 1000 USDC, they're expecting back 1.1 ethereum, right? So 1000 USDC times or over 900 now, because the liquidity provider is expecting back 1.1
00:15:36.694 - 00:16:50.960, Speaker B: ethereum below $900, and the trader already has one ethereum on their balance sheet, all they need is to have an extra 0.1 ethereum below $900. Right? But that 0.1 ethereum below $900 is always going to be less, worth less than 100 USDC. So that means that no matter what, the max losses are always going to be capped at 100 USDC or less. So if the max losses are capped at 100 USDC, and you can essentially deposit 100 USDC as collateral to borrow this LP token, which is worth $1,000, then that means you have ten x leverage. But if you were to borrow an LP token at the 999 liquidity range, at the 999 USDC tick, then the max losses would no longer be $100, but they would be one dollars.
00:16:50.960 - 00:17:12.070, Speaker B: And that means that with $1 you can borrow up to $1,000, which is 1000 x leverage. And obviously the closer and closer you get to the market price, and the closer you can borrow an LP token to the market price, the more leverage it enables.
00:17:13.290 - 00:17:26.870, Speaker A: Wow, okay, that's super exciting. And there's a ton to unpack there. So first thing that comes to mind is one of the last things you said is the maximum amount of leverage then capped at the univ three tick range.
00:17:27.030 - 00:17:39.902, Speaker B: That's correct, yes. So practically speaking, in our v one infinity pools is only going to be able to offer about 1000 to 2000 x leverage, which honestly should be enough to satisfy most people.
00:17:39.956 - 00:17:43.530, Speaker A: But come on, that's it. I'm kidding.
00:17:43.690 - 00:17:52.260, Speaker B: Yeah, eventually it will grow to higher than that if there is truly desire for it, but yes.
00:17:53.190 - 00:17:59.106, Speaker A: Awesome. And so now I guess what I'm thinking is, all right, so let's say the trade moves against the trader.
00:17:59.138 - 00:17:59.286, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:59.308 - 00:18:14.278, Speaker A: And so the price is falling when it crosses over that $900 range. Let's say then does the trader's position automatically get closed out or are they just like essentially out of the money but still holding onto the collateral?
00:18:14.454 - 00:18:52.600, Speaker B: Yeah, so the latter, and that's a great way to put it, there is like an entire options parallel that we can use, but to stay kind of like more defi specific. Yes. Essentially the trader can keep their position open no matter where the price goes, as long as they keep paying the interest on the LP token that they have borrowed. So when they stop paying that interest, it's not a liquidation. It's more like not rolling an options position, to use the term you just did.
00:18:53.290 - 00:19:01.930, Speaker C: So would the fees, the funding fees be taken out of the traders collateral automatically as the fees accrue?
00:19:02.350 - 00:19:36.486, Speaker B: Yeah. Correct. Really? The way that leverage. Right. Like leverage is not only a factor of the money, that leverage is not only a factor of the minimum, then it's not only a factor of the max loss, it's also a factor of the interest. Right. So you got to add essentially the max loss and the interest that you pay to actually figure out what the leverage is.
00:19:36.486 - 00:20:15.554, Speaker B: Right. So for example, if your max loss, once again for 1000 x leverage is one dollars, but then you have to pay another dollar upfront in interest, then your leverage is actually 500 x, it's not 1000 x. So basically to us, yes, it is very much intertwined. And by the way, that's what ave flash loans I believe are. Right. A lot of people think that they're unlimited. You can borrow as much as you want, but I believe that it's about 1000 x leverage because you still have 0.9%
00:20:15.554 - 00:20:18.580, Speaker B: or nine bits like interest payment.
00:20:19.990 - 00:20:27.080, Speaker A: Right. Okay. And so I guess further on that point then, how are interest rates or funding rates determined within the infinity pool system?
00:20:27.770 - 00:21:11.554, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So this is a great question. Our interest rate, the protocol's interest rate, is made up of two parts. The first part is what we call a fair interest rate, the fair interest rate. You can think of it as an interest rate that's there to offset impermanent loss. What I mean by that is that it is a yield that liquidity providers or really like any financial investor would expect to get paid in order for being exposed to the negative convexity of impermanent loss. Right.
00:21:11.554 - 00:22:09.380, Speaker B: So it's basically just a yield that theoretically offsets impermanent loss, hopefully perfectly over the long term. The second part of the interest rate is a utilization rate. So you can think of it as like Ave or compound type utilization rate. It responds to supply and demand, right? So if the demand for 1000 x leverage is extremely high, then DLP tokens that are near the market price will actually be a lot more expensive to borrow, for example, than DLP tokens that are further away from the market price, right. So there's a fantastic mechanism there to really kind of get more liquidity providers to come in and provide liquidity when demand for leverage is high. I guess I'll stop there for a second.
00:22:10.630 - 00:22:19.550, Speaker C: Yeah, that's great. I think from my perspective it'd be helpful because you already laid out an example like going levered long. Can you kind of lay out an example as well? The other direction?
00:22:19.650 - 00:23:43.234, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's pretty much the exact opposite, right? So to go levered long, what you're doing is that you're borrowing USDC and swapping it for an asset, in this case ethereum, right? So in order to go short, you would do the exact opposite, which is borrow Ethereum and sell it for USDC. So the way that you're going to do that is that you're going to borrow an LP token that is above the market price and therefore an LP token that is deployed at a tick above the market price and redeem it for the ethereum that backs it and then sell that ethereum for USDC. So pretty much the exact same example the opposite way. And actually one question that I always get is, what about liquidity fragmentation? Is this a peer to peer protocol? Right, because in the example that I gave you, it's a liquidity provider that lends directly to a lender to a trader. The protocol actually does the mixing and matching by itself, which is actually a super cool mechanism. Essentially what happens is that, number one, you can actually combine different ticks at different ranges to get to the leverage you want.
00:23:43.234 - 00:25:09.726, Speaker B: So in the example that I gave you, you have a tick at $900 that's used for ten x leverage, but ten x leverage can actually be created with ticks at other price ranges. For example, you can combine liquidity that's deployed at the 850 USDC tick and at the 950 USDC tick. So above and below to essentially get to that 900 USDC, to basically recreate liquidity at 900 USDC. So essentially what the protocol does is that when the liquidity provider deposits their token, the protocol essentially does mixing and matching off chain to see what is the best combination of liquidity to create the leverage that is being asked for by the trader, right? So the trader goes, hey, I want ten x leverage. The protocol is going to look okay, what ticks are available, what are the interest rates for each individual tick? And then combine those ticks to create the cheapest leverage for the trader. And that way it's a peer to pool to peer ave or compound style again. And there's zero liquidity fragmentation now.
00:25:09.828 - 00:25:39.574, Speaker A: Okay, that's an interesting mechanism because I was thinking about the supply side of this, right? Like it's a two sided protocol with traders and lps. And on the supply side, are you aiming to attract liquidity that will say, hey, I'm just coming to, I want to be an infinity pools lp, but whatever they do with my liquidity after that is fine. Or is this something who's attracting lps that are already univ. Three lps that are like hey, this is a way that I can earn additional yield on something I'm already doing?
00:25:39.692 - 00:26:57.918, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a fantastic question and I think it's going to be a combination of both. Right. Just because number one, really at a high level, what you're doing here is almost lending out your univ free lp tokens, which means that you're not only generating additional yield, but you're also getting paid on a continuous basis. And that second thing is actually very important and I think will bring a whole new set of liquidity providers, or actually it'll bring a whole new set of investors and yield farmers to the liquidity provisioning ecosystem, if you will. So what do I mean by that? Currently, the only way that you can generate yield on Uniswap v three and like pretty much any amm, is by essentially getting your liquidity in the price range, right. So you need to have the market price really be within your liquidity range. The big difference within fading pools is that even when your liquidity range is not even near the market price, you're still generating yield.
00:26:57.918 - 00:28:18.314, Speaker B: Right? So in the example that I gave you, once again, where the liquidity is deployed at $900 and the market price is at $1,000, right? So the market price is nowhere near the liquidity range. The liquidity range is still getting borrowed by a trader, which means that that liquidity is being used and if it's being used, then it's being paid for. And yeah, basically what that means is that no matter where your liquidity is, you're still getting paid some yield. And that actually comes with some really cool implications, one of which is that so far most investors had to rebalance as often as possible to be as near to the spot price and to the market price as possible. But here you could very well see a strategy working where an investor wants to keep all of their assets or all of their portfolio in a single asset. And basically what they would do is that they would lend out their token. They would provide liquidity away from the market price.
00:28:18.314 - 00:28:55.554, Speaker B: And essentially, as the market price gets closer and closer to their liquidity range, they would move it away. That way they can continuously generate yield while staying in a single asset. And that completely flips liquidity, provisioning incentives on their head. And it's pretty cool because it's also fantastic for passive investors. I think that one of the things that we've seen specifically with Univ free is that passive investors are getting more and more run over. And by the way, this is not just univ free. I'm using Univ.
00:28:55.554 - 00:30:08.634, Speaker B: Free because they're very clearly the leaders in the space. But what we've seen is that more and more, you have all sorts of attacks that are essentially taking profits from these passive investors, and that it's becoming more and more of a high frequency mev type game where you have jit. I believe Jit is a good thing in the end for Uniswap as a whole, because it's essentially just like a janky RFQ system, right, where somebody places an order and then essentially some liquidity provider will come in at the very last minute and fill that order with no slippage. That's fantastic. Why wouldn't you do that? That's great. But who it's not great for is obviously the passive liquidity providers, who are essentially getting exposed to impermanent loss, but not making any of the fees. So I guess my point was that infinity pools is good for passive investors for three different reasons.
00:30:08.634 - 00:31:34.250, Speaker B: The first one that I mentioned is higher yields, and I'll talk a little bit more about that. But essentially, if Uniswap like yields are below realized volatility currently, and then you've got realized volatility and then implied volatility, which is above realized volatility. And usually volatility is sold at implied vol or implied volatility levels, then we believe that infinity pools will at least be above realized volatility. It's not 100% mathematically guaranteed, but there are some very cool volatility arbitrage, while there is actually a super simple volatility arbitrage trade that you can do to make sure that all P's are always at least compensated realized VoL, which means that at a high level, liquidity providers are not losing money, which is better than the current status quo. So that's the first good thing. And then once again the volatility arbitrage gets you to realize vault, but then with the utilization rate and with any extra trades, then you should get to implied vault, if not above. But once again, can't make any claims on that until we actually launch.
00:31:34.250 - 00:32:31.500, Speaker B: That's the first point, right? Like higher yields. The second point is continuous yield, right? Which means that once again, you can stay in a single asset, you can have your liquidity range that's not even near or in the market price, once again, great for passive investors. And the last thing is that because trades are done because you're paid your yield on a continuous basis and not in a single big chunk like you are in spot trading markets. We are just in time liquidity resistant, or liquidity providers are just in time liquidity resistant because it's spread out over time. You can't just come in for one block and claim majority of the profits. Yeah, I guess I'll stop here for now and see if there are any questions.
00:32:32.030 - 00:33:02.486, Speaker A: Yeah, this has been great. And I think one of the most interesting parts of this equation is really on the supply side, because if you think about just like the ETH USDC pool today, for example, in a univ. Three pool, liquidity is not perfectly spread across that, right. It's condensed around the current market price and as well as it favors going long in this equation. So does the imbalance between the long and short position create any issues for infinity pools? Or is that like, I'm curious how you guys think about that.
00:33:02.668 - 00:33:18.860, Speaker B: Okay, so basically you're talking about the basis, right? I guess a simpler way, because there are more people trying to go long, there might be less liquidity on the long side of things. Is that kind of like what you're asking about?
00:33:20.750 - 00:34:14.990, Speaker A: Okay, so we thought about who is lping in certain tick ranges across the ETH USDC pool. It tends to be condensed towards around the market price. And then specifically I think it'll be above the market price. Right. So how does that impact infinity pools? Or do you think, I guess a different way to rephrase that question would be really like, how does a tick range for lps in infinity pools really impact the ability of traders to take different leverage positions long? Right. So I'm just curious. I guess what I'm trying to get is the example you gave where an LP can come in and constantly keep their liquidity tick out of range and just keep moving it away from the market price, how does that benefit infinity pools?
00:34:15.650 - 00:35:21.282, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So once again, what you got to separate out is the borrowing and then the swapping part of things, right? So infinity pools, and where most of our liquidity is going to be useful, is on the borrowing side of things, right? So once again, margin trading is two things. You borrow cash to go long, you borrow cash, and then you swap that cash for an asset, and that's how you go long. Right? Infinity pools, once again separates those two things, right? The liquidity in infinity pools is used for borrowing, and that means that it doesn't matter how close it is to the market price. It does matter because it matters a little bit, because obviously the closer it is to the market price, the more leverage it enables, but it matters less. Right. And then you've got the swapping part.
00:35:21.282 - 00:36:26.406, Speaker B: Right, which is like, once you've borrowed the cash, you need to swap that. And once again, you can swap the borrowed assets using any decks, not just infinity pools, which means that it doesn't really matter if we don't have any liquidity near a spot, but if we do have liquidity near the market price, that's actually even better for us, because liquidity near the market price allows for whatever, like 1000 x leverage. But if that liquidity allows for 1000 x leverage, that means that it allows for all liquidity levels below it, right? So 1000 x leverage LP token allows for ten x leverage too. It allows for 100 x. And so as long as we have liquidity around the spot price, the spot market price, that's actually fantastic. So essentially, it's kind of like all scenario win win type of thing?
00:36:26.588 - 00:36:55.410, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought it was interesting, too, how you kind of pointed out how you will kind of match different lp tokens at different rages in order to get the desired leverage. So it sounds like you're definitely going for the retail user, or the average user, I should say so. Do you see this being more so a protocol that is kind of like a uniswap, where it's like the go to place to trade with leverage? Or do you view it more as maybe something that protocols can utilize underneath the hood?
00:36:56.230 - 00:37:47.330, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I would definitely say the former. Right. I think that this protocol isn't that good for everyone, especially retail. The reason being, once again, that number one perpetual future and retail has a high tendency to be the ones that get wrecked on liquidations, on perpetual futures, especially as they get to higher levels of leverage. And I don't know if you guys saw the chart that I had in the medium article we posted, but the expected returns with infinity pools as you crank up your leverage actually don't go down. So number one, we're kind of like protecting retail on their expected returns from liquidations.
00:37:47.330 - 00:38:49.910, Speaker B: Number two, with the no counterparty risk, then we're also kind of protecting them from black swan long tail events. Essentially. I do think that this is a net good not only for retail, but also the entire finance industry. And I really hope it does become kind of like the go to place for people to go and get leverage. As for the liquidity provisioning side of things, we're still trying to figure out exactly who's going to be the biggest provider of liquidity there. One interesting use case that I'm actually very excited about, and I'm not sure that we should be the ones building it just because we need to stay focused. But one of the really cool things you can do is that you can essentially build LP liquidity provisioning payoffs.
00:38:49.910 - 00:40:07.310, Speaker B: And essentially these LP payoffs can take any shape depending on where you put your liquidity. And what that means is that you can essentially create liquidity positions such that they resemble more common structured products. So for example, you can create a covered call using a liquidity position on infinity pools. Now that may seem like, okay, well, we already have access to covered calls, so what's the point? Well, there are three huge perks to creating structured products on the liquidity provisioning side of infinity pools versus vanilla structured products. Number one, it's available on the long tail of assets. So once again, you kind of have that uniswap playbook where you can not only list structured products on the long tail of assets, but also do it way faster than anyone else. Number two, these structured products last as long as you want, right? There's no need to roll over any positions, which means that you, number one, don't need to pay a fee to market makers.
00:40:07.310 - 00:41:10.340, Speaker B: And specifically this fee is usually called a spread. So you don't need to pay a spread to market makers to roll over your structured products every week. Number three, you can withdraw at any time, which is actually something that people kind of tend to underestimate when they're first putting their money into structured products. Right. Some innovative structured products in DFI, like ribbon, have found some cool ways around that, like having only deploying 80 or 90%, I think, of their assets and structured products so that 10% of those assets just kind of remain idle in case somebody wants to withdraw before the end of the period is over. But then you're taking a hit on the efficiency of the yields. So yeah, just kind of like free, huge perks already over traditional structured products.
00:41:10.340 - 00:41:31.698, Speaker B: Not only that, but it's incredibly flexible, it's incredibly permissionless, which means that you can create any structured products instantly and permissionlessly. And yeah, I'm very excited to see people build on top of infinity pools and come up with cool, innovative solutions to this.
00:41:31.804 - 00:41:55.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the proposition there is super exciting and what's interesting is it's like putting layers on top of, because you guys are building on top of Univ. Three. And I'm curious if it's like the trader Joe liquidity book is quite similar to the Univ. Three model. And I'm curious if infinity pools can be composable with other concentrated liquidity type amms or if it's specifically focused on Univ. Three.
00:41:55.896 - 00:42:31.260, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Once again, the way that we see is that the borrowing part and then there are two parts, right? Like the swapping part, we can use anyone. So that's already good to go. So really the main thing that we have to worry about is the borrowing, right? And yeah, right now we'd have to see, but as long as people are willing to take the same payoff as Univ. Free lps, it should work with us.
00:42:31.790 - 00:42:45.780, Speaker C: I'm curious if you have any takes on order books if that becomes a more prominent venue for trading into the future as l two s kind of develop. Does that put a hole in your model or is there a way you could kind of adapt to that sort of thing?
00:42:46.550 - 00:43:18.890, Speaker B: Honestly? Yeah, we could definitely be deployed on top of an order book. Once again, it'd be interesting, right? Because once again, Univ free is just like a big order book if you think about it. There'd be a couple of different things that we'd have to do slightly differently. Obviously it would be a lot of technical work, but overall, yeah, univ free and order books are basically the same, so I don't really see any massive blockers.
00:43:19.310 - 00:43:26.750, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I'll let you launch first. Before I start asking those questions, I'm also curious, where are you thinking about deploying?
00:43:27.890 - 00:43:45.250, Speaker B: That's a great question. Our code built in solidity, we're EVM compatible, so it's going to be on an EVM. We haven't made any final decisions yet, but we are definitely leaning towards l two s as it currently stands.
00:43:46.310 - 00:44:04.540, Speaker A: And is that mostly because of the impact that gas fees can have on the profitability of these things, or just granted that Ethereum mainnet has such a large TVL and specifically looking at Univ three, there's about two and a half billion dollars on main net. I think arbitrum is coming up second there with around 110 or so million.
00:44:04.990 - 00:45:09.194, Speaker B: Yeah, big time. Okay. Basically our protocol is pretty tough to build. One of the reasons that we released our white paper so early on is because we think that even if people read it, they're not going to be able to essentially just kind of copy us just because there are quite honestly just a few very complex things in there and even things that we haven't even put in there. But essentially the short answer is yes, it is because of gas costs, but it's mostly because we don't want to focus on optimizing gas costs. Initially, we essentially want to ship an MVP fast, prove out the concept, and then take care of gas optimizations and later ship on if you're a main net. So if you're a main net is completely doable because we don't have oracles and we don't have counterparty risk.
00:45:09.194 - 00:45:19.278, Speaker B: If you had oracles, then you'd be fucked because block times take forever. But in our case we're chilling. So it's really just a question of gas costs.
00:45:19.454 - 00:45:43.194, Speaker A: Right. And that makes a lot of sense. Just granted out, it's kind of like playing the long game there. And if your view is that the ethereum roll up centric roadmap is the way, then it kind of makes sense to really focus your building into that model. So this does sound like an incredibly attractive protocol, which begs the question of how is the protocol looking to kind of generate revenue? Or maybe it's running on a more of a public good model, or how are you thinking about that?
00:45:43.392 - 00:46:09.118, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a fantastic question and something that we've actually been discussing internally a lot. One of the very nice things about this protocol is that it's so close to the money on so many different fronts. Right. There are so many different opportunities. Opportunities, or it's a better word. Yeah. There are so many different places to take off a fee.
00:46:09.118 - 00:46:54.498, Speaker B: So one of them is obviously when you swap out your assets using a Dex aggregator, you could take a fee there. When you borrow assets, we could charge a small interest rate. On top of that. There's also some other much more technical beyond things I won't get into. But there's essentially another thing where no one is actually really losing. Basically there's like surplus in the protocol sometimes and we can just take that surplus. I really look up to uniswap in that sense and I want to see also what if they kind of decide to do with their v four.
00:46:54.498 - 00:47:28.730, Speaker B: I know that they've also been thinking about different ways of monetizing their protocol. Basically, we've got a couple of options and, yeah, we just really need to figure out which one is the best, not only from a regulatory perspective, but also from doing our users good perspective. Yeah.
00:47:28.800 - 00:47:40.190, Speaker C: Have you thought much about governance? I know it's very early on, but I'm curious if decentralizing is of utmost importance to you or if that's kind of something you'd like to push down the line until you get everything operating correctly.
00:47:40.610 - 00:48:34.142, Speaker B: Yeah, once again, great question, governance. First of all, I'll start off by saying that completely decentralizing governance is a terrible idea. I'm extremely bearish on that. I believe that the best models for dows going forward are going to be very centralized, but kind of like democratically elected. So, for example, the way that democracies are run, right where it's still very decentralized, I run votes for a given person. But in the end, you do need that concentration of power and of responsibility into a few people. And the reason I say this is because if you knew some of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes at infinity pools, you'd be like, well, okay, 99.99%
00:48:34.142 - 00:49:33.330, Speaker B: of people are not going to understand how this works, so why should they actually come in and be like, okay, yeah, I think this is the right decision. It doesn't really make sense now for big decisions that are much more easy to grasp. But then we can talk about it. But in the end, what you really need is a focused team that's got the protocol's best interests at heart. Basically, either run it like big public companies are run today, or run it like the governments are run today, is my best guess for how effective governance is going to be done in the future. Proven governance models. There's a reason that not everyone is making decisions from their phone on the public policy in America or like in Europe.
00:49:33.670 - 00:49:40.514, Speaker C: Yeah, it took us a thousand years to get to where we are here in the US. So maybe take a lesson or two from that playbook.
00:49:40.562 - 00:50:11.280, Speaker B: I feel that it's like the darwinism of governance where it's like, okay, well, there's a reason that evolution has made humans, and there's a reason that governance is the way it is today. So I don't know. Hot take maybe, but I feel like people that have. I went to a talk recently with another prominent Defi founder, and I think he agreed with me, so maybe it's not as hot of a take as I thought.
00:50:13.410 - 00:50:30.600, Speaker C: Yeah, well this was awesome. We really appreciate your time. This is really refreshing to get a project that's building like a completely new foundational concept. So we'll have to get you back on here in like four to six months to get an update on where you guys are at. But is there anything else you want to share with the listeners, where to find you, where to learn more?
00:50:31.050 - 00:51:06.254, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So we've got our discord that's open, our Twitter dms are open. I'm pretty responsive on both those. Usually these past two days have been a little more difficult just because I've gotten hundreds of dms, but going forward I'll try to improve my sla. Our white paper is incredibly interesting and a fantastic read. Highly recommend everyone to check it out. And yeah, I mean we're coming out with a testnet, hopefully late Feb, early March.
00:51:06.254 - 00:51:45.520, Speaker B: So when that's out, definitely check us out, test us out, see how it works. The UX is going to be super nice. We've got one of the best front end teams in the entire space. They actually built matcha before this, the Dex aggregator, which I personally thought had one of the best uis. And yeah, basically it'll look exactly like trading perps. So all of that complex stuff that I talked about completely abstracted away, it's a fantastic ux. And yeah, big shout out to them.
00:51:46.050 - 00:52:16.120, Speaker A: You said a ton to be bullish about, but honestly that might be the biggest reason on it, just to be straightforward. Crypto is so hard to use these days and it's cool for the people like us that are in here doing it every day, but the reality is if you're going to scale, we need to simplify things. So strong focus on UX is exciting and glad to hear that you've managed to bring in some gigabrains around you to help build out kind of every inch of the protocol. But Matthew, this was incredible. I really appreciate you coming on and thanks. We'll definitely be watching along.
00:52:16.570 - 00:52:18.180, Speaker B: Thanks guys, thanks for having me.
