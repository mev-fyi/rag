00:00:00.200 - 00:00:31.272, Speaker A: Because if you think about it, we already made the contrarian decision to start the company on Solana, which at the time was very much not where a lot of the NFT activity actually was. The majority, like 90% was actually on Ethereum, even just from the outset. That we are not dogmatically aligning with this chain or that chain. It's more just where do we think some of the new and exciting use case experimentation is going to happen? And we should just be there for that, because as a platform we should be agnostic to all of that.

00:02:07.694 - 00:02:10.594, Speaker A: Hey, thanks for having me, guys. Nice to nice to see you both.
00:02:12.254 - 00:02:17.634, Speaker C: Before we get started, do you want to give a short introduction on Magic Eden and what you guys have built?
00:02:18.434 - 00:02:43.454, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So, Magic Eden, we've been around since September 2021. Feels like a lot longer than that, but it's only been two and a half years. But we're a cross chain NFT marketplace. So we support NFT marketplace on, I think, five. Yeah, five chains now. So Ethereum, Solana, bitcoin base and polygon.
00:02:43.454 - 00:03:23.974, Speaker A: And more recently, we've also become a multi product company in that as part of building out this cross chain experience, we've realized that there's a lot of gaps and limitations to the ultimate user experience that you can offer to people who are coming to the product, which is what brought us down the path of building also a cross chain wallet, which is the magic Eden wallet. So, yeah, it's been a pretty interesting journey across many, many NFT ecosystems, ups and downs of nfts, and are now expanding beyond nfts as well. So happy to dive in and talk about any of the above.
00:03:25.034 - 00:03:40.844, Speaker C: Perfect. I think. Just to kick us off, I want to ask you guys about your shift towards the bitcoin ecosystem a few months back. I'm not sure exactly how long ago, but kind of want to understand, like, your decision process behind this and how you guys decided to approach this.
00:03:41.304 - 00:04:43.310, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. It's funny because I feel like more people know about us for bitcoin than, or at least it feels that way than for anything else, which is kind of crazy because it's a relatively new part of our business. So I'll go back with just a little bit more background and then I'll share about the specific bitcoin decision. But very, very early on in the company, maybe about three or four months in, we always knew we would become a multi chain company, and we just didn't exactly know how that would play out. But we had that pretty clear idea in our heads, because if you think about it, we already made the contrarian decision to start the company on Solana, which at the time was very much not where a lot of the NFT activity actually was. The majority, like 90%, was actually on Ethereum. And so that kind of shows a little bit about maybe what our mentality is, even just from the outset, that we are not dogmatically aligning with this chain or that chain.
00:04:43.310 - 00:06:00.424, Speaker A: It's more just where do we think some of the new and exciting use case experimentation is going to happen? And we should just be there for that, because as a platform, we should be agnostic to all of that. But if you would ask me when we started the company, would I have thought we'd be building on bitcoin? I would have absolutely said no, with probably a lot of conviction, because I just didn't think it was possible. There was not really a way to do it. So with that background, when the ordinals protocol did come out in the beginning of 2023, a little over a year ago, it definitely piqued our interest immediately, because, I mean, there were many, many ways to read it, but our reading of it was that, oh, for the first time, you could build something very, very similar to nfts on bitcoin, and it would be a way for users to basically stack their bitcoin, which obviously people want to do. Right. That's kind of how we've seen a lot of the uptake in many of the other ecosystems, whether it's trading fungible tokens or trading nfts, earning yield, like, all this kind of stuff. Right? So it opens up that whole world.
00:06:00.424 - 00:06:40.494, Speaker A: And it didn't take us long to actually get conviction on the idea. I think it probably took us, end to end, about two weeks to get our head around. Like, this is something we should do mainly for the fact that we felt like if people were interested in those kinds of use cases on a chain like Ethereum, there's no reason why that also would not be true for bitcoin. So this was early 23. We made the call. It took us about three or four weeks to get started on building this. And from beginning, idea conception to launch.
00:06:40.494 - 00:07:05.224, Speaker A: Yeah, probably about a month. And, yeah, the rest is history. So I would kind of call it, like, it's funny, people now sort of frame it as, like, a yo. We totally changed the company to become a bitcoin company. It's definitely not like that. But bitcoin, for sure, has been a really exciting ecosystem, and it's become obviously, a much larger part of Magic Eaton. But it's definitely just one of the big steps along our journey to become a cross chain company.
00:07:05.884 - 00:07:24.324, Speaker D: Were there any, like, additional challenges with launching support for bitcoin versus, like, any other particular, like, say, EVM chain or even Solana? I'm just curious about, given that it's a Utxo model versus a ledger based system, I'm curious if there's just any other pain points that kind of came up in the bitcoin process when indexing ordinals.
00:07:24.984 - 00:07:36.232, Speaker A: Dude, so there were so many problems. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I can't. I can't even count. It's like, yeah, too many to even mention. But number one. Yeah, it was.
00:07:36.232 - 00:08:16.816, Speaker A: It probably took us, number one, like a week or two just of scoping just to see if it was possible to build a marketplace like that in and of itself. We were, like, not even sure if that was possible. It ended up being my co founder, Rex. He ended up just spending a bunch of time to do the diligence and he came back and was like, yeah, I think the answer is yes, I think, but we've got to do some work here. And that was even before we even built the thing. And then, yeah, a lot of the work that we had put in to enable nfts on Solana and ethereum, it was not totally transferable, especially on the backend, because of exactly this. Like the Utxo model, right.
00:08:16.816 - 00:08:51.776, Speaker A: Indexing was totally different. There wasn't even really a standard of how to index. We were making it up along with other people in the ecosystem around like a canonical way to do that. There were not even things like the concept of a collection didn't even exist on chain, which you take for granted, like these things on Solana and Ethereum. And then now I'll give you another example of just UX challenges. Now it's like when people are trading things like runes, you have to account for the Utxo model because things are not exactly fungible. Right.
00:08:51.776 - 00:09:36.662, Speaker A: Because of the way the Utxo thing works. So how do you then have to, do you enable people to split utxos? Like, how do you do that? So there's all these like downstream UX implications, let alone just building the right system to enable the expansion. Super challenging. And now one of the things that we've done to mitigate and at least come to resolution on a lot of this is we actually have built now a full stack bitcoin team. So not just back end engineering, it's like a whole engineering team around bitcoin. It's a whole operations team around bitcoin. So that the operations team and support team can read bitcoin transactions, which are really different to read versus other chains.
00:09:36.662 - 00:10:12.306, Speaker A: There's a BD and marketing team. So it's like we've now built up a lot of that muscle. But in the beginning it was really, really hard because we did not have a lot of the internal deep bitcoin knowledge. We had to learn it, which makes this whole thing even more crazy because it's a full stack bet that you have to internalize at the time. It's very hard to put your mind and wrap your head around, like how many things you actually have to do when you build a new marketplace. People kind of just think it's like, yo, stab your fingers, like, turn on the chain, you're good to go. It's really, it's a lot more than that.
00:10:12.306 - 00:10:19.562, Speaker A: So, yeah, we've had to think about a lot of this since then. Too many examples, man. I'm like getting PTSD just thinking about it.
00:10:19.658 - 00:10:54.142, Speaker D: Yeah, that's funny. It was a bit of a leading question. I spend a lot of my time in on chain data and got my start in the EVM world on Ethereum and started messing around with Solana and then started touching bitcoin data. So I know the trials and tribulations all too well. But one other follow up I had there is you mentioned runes. And so, you know, you spend all this time you're indexing ordinals. That's all based around this one type of protocol, and then someone goes on and builds runes, which is supposed to be somewhat of an improvement in some ways on the ordinals style of thing, of creation, and really leaning towards a more fungible, what looks like a fungible token.
00:10:54.142 - 00:11:24.234, Speaker D: You know, I personally have my doubts on whether or not it really feels like a fungible token, but I'm curious. So basically the point here is there's one standard you build around and now there's a new one. You're like, okay, so now you guys have integrated root and support. Presumably there'll be another one in the future, would be my assumption, based on this pattern. And I'm curious, like, how do you think about having to continuously build support around these new primitives that come up and, like, the challenges there versus something like, I guess even Ethereum NFTs have kind of gone through some evolution over time, but maybe at a bit slower pace.
00:11:24.774 - 00:11:57.154, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, this is actually a really good, really good point because, um, I could name many, many examples on all the chains actually where this is happening. Um, and in some ways, I think this is the reason why it's like, you got to be crazy to build an NFT marketplace because it's like, you got to deal with all of this. Like, I'll give you some examples. Like, okay, on bitcoin, it's like ordinals. Uh, even before runes, there was BRC 20, and then now there's, now there's runes and there's actually many more. There was like BRC 420 and BrCA whatever. There was like all these random ones.
00:11:57.154 - 00:12:38.134, Speaker A: On Solana, there's like P NFTs token 22. Yeah, there's many, there's so many of them. And then on ETh as well. So it is really hard because you actually, the goal, actually the perfect world is actually that people just kind of rally around a single standard as much as possible because then you can just build it once and that takes care of that indexing layer and then everything else. You can just iterate from there. When you have to then add many, many of these standards. Yeah, it definitely changes the infrastructure you need to have.
00:12:38.134 - 00:13:16.258, Speaker A: On bitcoin, for example, we actually did build BRC 20 initially. We have since stopped supporting it because we just, as a team, we just didn't have the resources to actually support everything. So we kind of took that out and then we ended up doing runes instead because we think runes is actually an upgraded fungible standard. And I accept your comment about fungible. It's not really fully fungible. It's somewhere in between because of the UtxO model. They're more like trading bundles of fungible tokens, um, rather than true fungible tokens.
00:13:16.258 - 00:14:02.154, Speaker A: But it's like a step in the right direction, I think. Um, and yeah, a lot of this complexity, I think it's, it's multifaceted. It's kind of like we have to do some thinking and internalization about should we or shouldn't we support these things? Which is more of like a strategic question. And then there's a secondary execution question of like, okay, if we're going to do it, like how do we actually do it and how do we actually maintain it? Because the cost isn't so much. Can we just do it once? It's like you gotta continuously maintain indexing, otherwise. Yeah, otherwise you can fall behind pretty quickly. So we've done that through a combination of building it in house, but also partnering with third parties who can help with powering some of this infrastructure.
00:14:02.154 - 00:14:44.454, Speaker A: So as an example, on EVM, we work with the third party who can help us, because what we want to get in the business of is how do we enable rapid chain expansion? Because there's so many EVM chains. Right. And it's like largely similar. Not, not exactly, but largely similar. So indexing, I think over time will probably become fairly commoditized, whereas something like bitcoin, it is so new and it is so complicated, there is some moat to be had by actually building that stuff in house and making it first class. Right. I think the same is true still to some degree on Solana, although over time I think it will also become more or less like taken care of.
00:14:44.454 - 00:14:55.174, Speaker A: So, yeah, anyway, like, not the same approach for all the chains is the short, short of it, I think. But on bitcoin we have done it like fully in house.
00:14:58.034 - 00:15:49.064, Speaker C: I want to ask a bit about building on bitcoin. Um, the first thing is that it feels kind of like, uh, Ethereum and Solana, for example. They just naturally lend themselves out to some of like, nfts, for example. But on bitcoin, uh, especially with runes, there's a lot more pressure on the app player where you have to kind of deal with some of these things as opposed to on the EVM and SVM, it just naturally comes. How do you guys approach that? Like how much do you want, you said you want to build most of these things out in house because it's like important and strategic. But how does, let's say, like the community work, the building community work around that? Like, are there other builders where like, we're going to focus on splitting UtXO, then you guys can exclusively focus on marketplaces? Or are you as magic trying to, let's say, bring that all under one app?
00:15:49.604 - 00:16:39.764, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's. This is exactly the exercise that we've gone through a few times now in bitcoin. And I'll give you guys a real example of something we talk through as a team just to give people a bit of insight into some of the sausage making behind the scenes, which, by the way, is not always very pretty, but for runes, yeah, because it was so new. Like, the thing was going live on halving day and no one, it's not as if you could build it and then test it, you know, because the thing itself is not even live. So it's like kind of a weird. It's probably one of the weirdest launches that I've ever been a part of because usually you kind of build things in a way that's like, it's like iterative. You go into beta and then you make sure that everything works and then.
00:16:39.764 - 00:17:40.933, Speaker A: Yeah, and then you kind of release from there. So there was definitely a question of like, what should we actually build? And it's like, do you want to build the trading experience? Do you want to build the etching and minting experience? Do you want to build the discovery experience? Do you want to build splitting basically that entire set of surfaces? I actually will just. Yeah, we actually were originally going to build the discovery experience first because we were not that confident that we could build an actual trading experience for day one because it was so time compressed. And eventually we figured out that we could probably build the trading experience. So we ended up building that first. And to answer the original question of, like, do we want to just do everything? Yeah, I think the answer is definitely not because there's actually too much to build. And I'll give you an example of one of the things we did in the early stages was because we were not going to build minting and etching on runes.
00:17:40.933 - 00:19:05.944, Speaker A: We decided to work with a couple of partners on that. So if you see on magic Eden today, there is like a mint, like a minting runes button that takes you to Luminex, for example. And Luminex has been an amazing platform to just discover all the things that are in progress minting. And then they have a link back to Magic Eden for post mint trading these runes, which is great because that allows us to focus on making the trading experience really, really good, which there's just more than enough to do right now and we can continue to work on. How do you bring more of the minting volume and everything towards magic Eden over time? But super happy to be working with others on that. And my broad philosophy on it is that even if you look at NFT ecosystems just on other chains, yeah, there's actually so much depth that goes into it. All of these platforms, products that focus on various parts of that chain, it's like, yo, you need someone who's going to do pre sales, someone's going to do whitelist tools, someone's going to do analytics, someone's going to do NFT marketplace over time, maybe there's some convergence and consolidation, but I think it doesn't really make sense to do it at the very, very beginning or the early stage of when an ecosystem is getting built out.
00:19:05.944 - 00:19:22.034, Speaker A: So right now in bitcoin, it's like, yeah, it makes a ton of sense for us to just focus on a couple of lanes, do them exceedingly well, and then hopefully the users like it and we can start to build more and more from there. But yeah, I think that's sort of how we think about it. It's like a trade off.
00:19:22.074 - 00:20:12.290, Speaker B: Wormhole is the leading interoperability platform for multi chain bridges and applications.

00:20:25.522 - 00:21:07.598, Speaker C: The age of interoperability is here with the launch of Teleporter, Avalanche becomes a seamlessly linked network of many sovereign blockchains that communicate so smoothly they feel like a single chain. Teleporter is an EVM compatible cross chain communication protocol built on top of Avalanche Corp messaging. It allows any EVM chain on avalanche to send messages, assets and data to one another in a simple, fast, affordable and secure way. Teleporter and Avalanche Corp messaging provide a new foundation for how avalanche blockchains can communicate and how developers can easily build cross chain applications out of the box.

00:21:07.686 - 00:22:03.544, Speaker D: So you mentioned something pretty interesting around this might be a little bit of a moat on, say, Solana or bitcoin, where doing a lot of this groundwork is still really, really challenging, versus the EVM side of things where she's become more commoditized for one reason or another. And if I look at, I pulled up nftpulse.org here and it's just like a breakdown of volumes by chain and then marketplaces on those chains. And Magic Eden has done 55% of volume on Solana over the last month and 78% for bitcoin, versus much lower percentages when you look at something like Ethereum main net polygon or base or three EVM chains. And so I'm curious, do you think that plays a role in kind of why you guys are doing outperforming relative on Solana and bitcoin relative to the EVM chains? Or is that just more a broader reflection of your business decision to focus on bitcoin and Solana?
00:22:05.204 - 00:23:08.958, Speaker A: Oh, good question. I think on, I don't know if it's either of those reasons. I think that, yeah, it's sort of multifaceted in that there's definitely some element of this that is like the unique, what is magicians unique ability to penetrate in each of these markets. And if you look at the history of magic Eden and where we've done well is we've done really, really well when we've entered markets that basically have a lot of high velocity of activity, which that was what drove a lot of our Solana business basically in the early days, even till now. And through that we developed a lot of brand recognition as being the main place and the main venue to access Solana nfts. And I think that's also true for bitcoin, where we were pretty early, right?
00:23:09.046 - 00:23:09.574, Speaker C: We weren't.
00:23:09.654 - 00:23:43.454, Speaker A: I don't think we were the first one. Very first. We were maybe like, yeah, the second or third, we were there very early. And then I think we also built a lot of infrastructure for the whole ecosystem, like open sourced a bunch of our stuff. And I think that actually probably has more to do with it. Sort of like entering the ecosystem at the right time and then having the right like product and like shipping velocity to then match the ecosystem such that you develop that brand recognition. And I think that on EVM, we've generally been very, very late entrance.
00:23:43.454 - 00:25:10.134, Speaker A: That's true, I think, for all of those chains actually ETH base and Polygon. But I think that's actually okay because I think that the way that I see the NFT market as a whole sort of evolving and our place in it is that it is kind of unnatural in some ways for a marketplace to have 90 80% of the market. Because at the end of the day, it is basically open liquidity across everyone because its all on chain. And therefore, I think the real moat is just over time, as more and more assets and value is split across many, many chains, you want to be the layer that is able to aggregate as much of that as possible, such that all of the inventory just becomes available. And therefore it might work out that maybe you're 30% of all the markets. But that actually is massive because, because it becomes such a fragmented space over many, many, many chains, and we'll start to see less trend towards one player becoming 90%. I think that's already becoming generally more and more true, definitely on EVM than I think probably over time on the other ones too.
00:25:10.134 - 00:25:24.554, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think even though it's quite a different profile, we kind of look at it at an aggregate level across all of the, all of the ecosystems. And that's sort of the drive and motivation for us to then add as many ecosystems as possible.
00:25:26.654 - 00:25:48.796, Speaker C: What are, I mean, as you mentioned, you guys were really. I don't think you were the first. I think there were like two marketplaces before you. But when you entered bitcoin, I feel like was the right time to enter bitcoin. Because before it was just way too difficult to use. And, like, you guys shipped a proper product, especially under magic Eden name. It was like.
00:25:48.796 - 00:26:12.034, Speaker C: I think it was a good entry. What are some other, let's say, EvM or non EVM chains that you guys are looking to expand into? Or do you see any other of these? Because you kind of talked about fragmentation of liquidity across multiple chains. How do you see, like, magic Eden approach that you said you want to be a layer, but what are some. I guess, like, over the next six to twelve months, where do you see magic heating, expanding more into?
00:26:12.494 - 00:26:43.644, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. So I don't think we'll. We're going to be able to expand to every single. Every single chain, but I think definitely we will be adding quite a few more through to the end of the year. The exact one's TBD. I think that we're doing, like, a lot of diligence and kind of scoping it out, but I think a few that we're keeping an eye on for sure are some of the other evm l one s that's like a.
00:26:43.644 - 00:27:05.702, Speaker A: Definitely. And I include, like, the parallel evms as part of that. Right. So, like, it's like, yeah, avalanche. Like, say monad. Like, and maybe the latter two are kind of more like, yeah, Monad towards the end of the year, right, given in their timeline. And then.
00:27:05.702 - 00:27:39.894, Speaker A: Yeah, keeping an eye on a bunch of the l two s. I think, in general, there hasn't been as much activity in l two s. At least that's from what we've observed, obviously a lot on a bunch on blast. Sort of like incentivized volume that's happening on blast at the moment. But other than that, I think we're seeing relatively little. And there's also a pretty interesting set of bitcoin and l two s that are coming to market. I use l two s generously as well as a term for bitcoin.
00:27:39.894 - 00:28:06.710, Speaker A: They're not like true native bitcoin l two s, but they are like, yeah, it's kind of like what polygon was to ethereum right before. There were, like, true optimistic roll ups and things like that. So keeping an eye on that. Like, I was just in bitcoin Asia the last four or five days, and that was a huge, massive theme of that entire week. People pretty excited about just. Yeah, some of the experimentation on l two s. So I think that's another area where we're keeping a pretty close.
00:28:06.742 - 00:28:16.454, Speaker C: Eye on with regard to bitcoin l two s. I assume that those will be easier to integrate with than it is with the bitcoin main chain.
00:28:16.494 - 00:28:16.670, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:16.702 - 00:28:24.714, Speaker C: Because, like, those building on top of the developers, they're ensuring that they have more compatibility than bitcoin does.
00:28:25.104 - 00:28:41.976, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. A lot of them are actually going the route of, like, EVM compatibility. So it kind of. Yeah, there's, like, oversimplification, but kind of just adding another EVM chain. So. Yeah, so we'll see. But there are also different approaches.
00:28:41.976 - 00:29:02.136, Speaker A: Like some. Some are. Yeah. Trying to use, like, other technologies as well. But for the most part, I would say most of them are generally taking some kind of evm approach. So, yeah, TLDR is like, just more chance, which is kind of crazy. It's like, we don't.
00:29:02.136 - 00:29:06.644, Speaker A: We need a lot more, but that's what we're getting. So that's the world we're entering into.
00:29:07.544 - 00:29:16.924, Speaker C: And you mentioned doing due diligence on these chains before you launch on them. Could you kind of walk through what you guys consider as a marketplace before you launch on a new chain?
00:29:17.334 - 00:29:59.836, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a mix of both technical diligence in the sense of, like, we want to get a really strong and robust technical understanding of how the thing works, not. Not just for our own comfort, but also if we can see if there's any, like, technical innovation that we can bring to the table as a result. Right. Solana is, like, the perfect example where we wanted to build it on Solana originally because it was really fast and cheap. So then we thought we could actually build a different NFT experience to what was available on Ethereum. L1. And same as for bitcoin, it's super slow and expensive.
00:29:59.836 - 00:30:54.074, Speaker A: It's the opposite. But at the same time, you can build stuff that's really different there because it's inscriptions and all of that. So that's the first thing we sort of really deeply understand what's technically possible, because then that drives the user experience that you can end up building. Then the second part of it is more like, this is, I guess, more applicable to chains and ecosystems that are live, which is what is actually happening there. What is our point of view on where we think this chain is going to go? Um, because when we add chains, it's not just like we add it as, like, something in the code and then onto the website, it's like we mobile. Like what I was saying before about bitcoin, we mobilize, like, a whole team, like, set of people around it. And, you know, for example, on bitcoin, we.
00:30:54.074 - 00:32:01.324, Speaker A: We built not only the marketplace then we invested in building like a ordinals launchpad to then help projects and creators launch on bitcoin. And for us to enter the market with a strategy like that, it's like you have to believe them that creators will want to come and do this. So why do they want to come and do it? Why do they want to do that over, say, launching it on any of the existing chains today? Like, what's in it for them? And we have to have conviction around that answer. And maybe the answer is different and it's like some other way. We think the chain can grow, but I think we have to, we do the diligence to get conviction on that before we go launch there, because we know that the opportunity cost of launching there and then nothing happening, which isn't always totally in our control, that's a pretty big opportunity cost because we could be working on many, many other things in the company. But I think that's basically the two things, technical and then like, ecosystem getting a view on like, how bullish is everyone on this chain. What's the activity? Who are the users? Who are the creators? Will other use cases emerge? Like that kind of stuff?
00:32:03.504 - 00:32:41.624, Speaker D: Yeah, it makes sense that there's a bit of a qualitative and quantitative aspect to weighing that out. And I'm curious how this parlays into your new wallet. The launch of the wallet is relatively recent and starting to get some great traction, and I've actually used it and it feels good, it's comfortable. It's been a great ux for me personally, and I'm just curious, how do you think about the bifurcation between the wallet and the actual web product or the marketplace if you're going to add support for one, where you always add support for the other, or are these two independent products that are growing both under the magic edit umbrella but kind of at their own speeds?
00:32:42.124 - 00:33:38.206, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, that's a great question, because it's good, because it's something we've been actually talking about quite a lot internally recently. So let me answer it kind of in two parts. The first is why? Maybe I'll share a bit about, like why we built the wallet. And then the second part I'll answer, kind of like, how it ties with the marketplace, all that. So the thesis behind us building this wallet was because as we were launching all these chains, we were actually, we kind of discovered a problem that, yeah, that we, I guess we always knew about, but we didn't fully, like, grok the extent of it, which was as a user and you come to magic Eden, and you want to suddenly use bitcoin, like, trade ordinals. It's like, oh, shit, I've been using, I don't know, metamask or something, right? Previously. And now I have to go.
00:33:38.206 - 00:34:01.290, Speaker A: Go get a new wallet to do this thing, which is another layer of friction. And then I have to go get bitcoin. I have to, like, do something with my exchange or, like, and then trade and then send the bitcoin over. So end to end, it's kind of like, oh, man, that's probably going to take, like, forever, you know, it's going to take hours at least. It's quite a lot.
00:34:01.402 - 00:34:06.258, Speaker D: I'm laughing here because this is exactly my story with how I started using the magic Eden.
00:34:06.306 - 00:34:27.276, Speaker A: Yeah, same with me. I remember when I first bought my first ordinal, I was like, oh, that was terrible. I can't believe we're, like, getting our users to go through this. This is awful. So anyway, then we realized that that is not a bitcoin only thing. That's kind of a general problem. Say, we went and added, I don't know, say or something.
00:34:27.276 - 00:35:31.908, Speaker A: It's like, yeah, magic eating users have to go get another wallet now to be able to do stuff. So that problem basically compounds. So it's like, say, you add n chains, it's always like n minus one or something of wallets that you have to have, users have to have. That was a fundamental problem we were trying to solve. So then we thought, okay, cool, let's build this multi chain wallet so users don't have to go through that experience. Let's also make it a core core use case within the wallet that users can go between the assets very seamlessly, such that if you were a user on ETH or Sol or something, and you suddenly now want ordinals, you can swap Sol or ETH to bitcoin and then get going straight away to circumvent the whole, like, let me go, like, go through exchange and then send the money back super convoluted. So that's the underlying rationale.
00:35:31.908 - 00:36:03.938, Speaker A: And it's been amazing to see the uptake so far. So I appreciate you, Dan, using the wallet. It's very happy to hear that it's meeting the need, but it's been really cool to see over half a million people download the wallet. So far, it's only been out, like, two and a half months. And the lion's share of activity is actually, uh, do people doing exactly that? It's like going between bitcoin and, and eth or soul. Right. As a core, core use case.
00:36:03.938 - 00:36:42.000, Speaker A: So it's really, really cool. Okay. And then to answer the second part, like, the, the actual question, uh, here around, like, how do we then see it with the marketplace and stuff? So they are two independent products in the sense of they should not be reliant on each other to, like grow or like scale. And that's a really important fundamental concept, because as a wallet, you have to be credibly independent. Right. It's like the wallet cannot just only do magic Eaton stuff otherwise, like, it's not that not useful. We have to maximize the usefulness of this wallet for people.
00:36:42.000 - 00:37:35.420, Speaker A: So therefore it should do much, much more than just the magic Eden stuff. And then conversely, it's like, yeah, for the marketplace, we cannot only just support magic eating wallet because a lot of users we know also use other wallets. It's like, it's chill. So they are run independently in that sense, where I think there is some connectivity is if we can utilize the fact that we are building both to then create something that is an excellent experience. And that is basically, there's two main elements there. One is if we can create really nice, seamless NFT use cases in the wallet. Like imagine like, yeah, minting, imagine open editions and claims and all these kinds of things, all the stuff that you like and use for nfts in the wallet, and then also the cross chain swapping to enable access to new ecosystems.
00:37:35.420 - 00:37:56.484, Speaker A: Right. Like, that enhances the magic eating experience for sure. But it's not only just for magic, it just generally is really good for cross chain stuff. So I think it's very likely over. Yeah, over. If we play this out, that the wallet will end up supporting a bunch of chains that the marketplace will not. Right.
00:37:56.484 - 00:38:34.852, Speaker A: At least they won't go exactly hand in hand. And I think that's to be expected. But we will be finding ways to drive really nice experiences for chains where they both are supported. Uh, because, because, yeah, there's some, like, delightful things you can do. Once, once we are, we can connect some of the core, like NFT and, and trading use cases between the two. So more to come on that front. But, uh, the first step here is just get it out with some of these core chains and get people, like, minimizing the effort and friction to go between them.
00:38:34.852 - 00:38:38.312, Speaker A: And I think so far it's been, been doing, doing, doing amazing.
00:38:38.488 - 00:39:28.204, Speaker D: Yeah, I love the approach there. And to go deeper on specifically the wallet side, I just want to get your take around crypto Ux as a whole. Right? So crypto is great and they provide you the optionality of self custody and truly owning your assets. But I have to imagine that the average NFT trader probably doesn't want of the spectrum of, like, maxing out your security versus maxing out your UX. My gut, which could be totally wrong, but my gut would be, most people probably want to maximize the UX and their trading experience. And so just even, like, the thought of managing a private key and having to, like, log in with this one password and if I forget it, I better hope I wrote down my, my seed phrase correctly and like, all the steps that are required in self custody. And I'm just curious how you think about that because I could imagine a world where we have some, like.
00:39:31.044 - 00:39:31.308, Speaker A: I.
00:39:31.316 - 00:40:05.894, Speaker D: Don'T know, like maximum security setting on your wallet. Like sort of like when you go on a UI, you press like advanced mode, right? That's when I can, like, get my private key and all that. But the reverse of that is where I just log in with a password, email and a password, or whatever it may be. And, like, I can just log into my wallet. I don't have these, like, clunky hex strings of addresses or private keys, like, basically trying to maximize the simplicity and abstract away all of the complexity for the user. And does that resonate at all with you or is there something you're trying to do or think is valuable? I'm just curious what you think the magic Eden wallet user would want.
00:40:06.194 - 00:40:40.012, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So I actually fully, pretty much agree with everything that you just said. And let me share as well how this manifests in some of the decisions we've made, like, and maybe how we think about the future. So today, we don't really like us as a product and a company. We don't go after normies, like, at all. And by normie, I mean, like, yeah, like, I don't know, like my, my dad or something, you know, who's like, not. Definitely not.
00:40:40.012 - 00:41:12.862, Speaker A: Like, doesn't have a wallet. You know, like, doesn't. Doesn't even have bitcoin. We're not going after any of those kinds of users. It's like Coinbase is going after those users. That's good. And the reason we don't go after them is because, yeah, that journey, even if we wanted to, say, reach them, which we probably could, we could do some ads and a bunch of others marketing to get people into the top of the funnel, but even if we wanted to do that, we wouldn't, because that onboarding journey is just too messed up.
00:41:12.862 - 00:42:15.384, Speaker A: It's too complicated. You have to basically be motivated already to come down this journey. And yeah, so for that reason, we don't even focus on that segment of users. So I really actually agree with what you were saying about, I don't know, these are actually my words of describing it. It's kind of like a graduation path where there is some like very seamless, like, social login experience to create like an account, create a profile which maybe has a wallet behind the scenes that the user doesn't really know about and get them using magic Eden and a bunch of the stuff that we have. And then once they are doing enough transactions or they've hit some amount of value in their wallet, then it makes sense for them to be like, yo, you're sufficiently kind of down this rabbit hole. You like, go get, go download the magic Eaton mobile wallet now, which is purely non custodial, and then start using that instead.
00:42:15.384 - 00:43:12.134, Speaker A: And that, I think, is basically the journey that we want to get to. Whereas today we're not even at step one in that when you come to magic Eden, you have to bring your own wallet. There's no social login type of experience and then even if we had that, there's no way to then link it to a non custodial wallet. So all these things, I think, are very, very possible to do. So that's what makes me pretty excited to continue down this path because we already have pretty interesting, exciting content and stuff to do on magic Eden, lots and lots of users are hitting the page every day. I do feel that many, many more people will want to experience it. So once we get some of these things built, it should become way easier, like ten x, easier for people to then experience some of the fun within magic Eden.
00:43:12.134 - 00:43:32.164, Speaker A: But this is a very iterative process. It's step one, building that cross chain wallet, step two, some of this social login stuff. Step three is how do you then bind all that together to create that graduation path so users can, no matter what segment they're in, they can kind of come in at any stage of that journey.
00:43:34.984 - 00:44:22.224, Speaker C: Perfect. Yeah, I agree with both of you. I like the idea of a graduation path. And I feel like there have been attempts at building some form, of course, work for crypto where you just move on, move on, move on. But it hasn't been done quite effectively enough. One question that I had for you guys on the NFT marketplace side is that recently, at least over the past year, I feel like there's been kind of a shift in what NFT marketplaces look like. Specifically that the new newly launched NFT marketplaces have more of a trading ux, like almost as similar to what a perpetual futures product would look like.
00:44:22.224 - 00:45:03.048, Speaker C: You guys have not launched this, at least as far as I know. What's the like? Is that something that you guys are planning on launching? And I guess more broadly, I kind of want to ask about how you view this shift, like, because when I view magic Eden, like you said, Solana is very fast and bitcoin is very slow. So I feel like magic Eden in itself is very suitable for bitcoin because it doesn't have necessarily a trading setup. Um, how do you view that? Is that something that you guys are considering? Like maybe you're going to launch a trading interface for Solana, but on bitcoin you'll keep the classic look.
00:45:03.136 - 00:46:16.060, Speaker A: What do you think? Yeah, I think the answer here is actually more based on, um, what does the future look like for the actual assets? Like what kinds of assets are these? Which I actually don't really have an answer on it because it's hard to put a stake in the ground. But what I will say is that over the last six months, I definitely think there's more blurring between NFTs and tokens. Now, that's obvious through 404s, but also more obvious as like a, as like meme coin trading has really picked up. Right. So to the degree that that trend continues, yeah, I do think it's valid to basically explore more of these, like, trading related experiences. And I would say that magic Eden is like, we're like somewhat already on that journey, just maybe not as explicitly as maybe some might think. And I'll give you two examples of that.
00:46:16.060 - 00:47:29.768, Speaker A: One is we built runes trading, which already is definitely not a full on order book exchange yet. But if you look at it, it's some very, very, very mvp version of an order book because that table that we have on runes is effectively just, here are all of the orders that people are willing to sell at, right? So that's number one. And then number two is that in our wallet you can already swap between various fungible tokens. And I think that'll continue to become a bigger part of magic over time. Are we interested in building like, like pro trading kind of stuff? Probably not for the sake of it, because I think our core user at the end of the day is like, we want to serve retail users. So I think that if that's like the underlying, like, foundational philosophy, then we probably will not be going down to the nth degree of building like a bunch of really professional trading tools. Like, we're not going to build like perpetuals trading or something like that.
00:47:29.768 - 00:48:25.588, Speaker A: That's like way too pro. But would we build like more, more tools that allow for retail traders to trade and that give them like, more signals and help them make better decisions when they trade? Yeah, that is conceivable because we think the retail audience can be very, very massive. Right. Whereas the pro audience is like relatively small. So, yeah, I don't know if that fully, fully answered your question, but to sum it up, I think it's like, what are the asset types? We are already somewhat building some stuff that more resembles, like, fungible trading and we're definitely interested in it. But a lot of this is going to be a gradual evolution so long as that the assets themselves are moving in that direction. If they continue to be like, I don't know, like gaming NFT items, then it's kind of a different story.
00:48:25.588 - 00:48:30.464, Speaker A: Right. But I think it's a little hard right now to put a stake in the ground around what those assets will be.
00:48:31.364 - 00:49:06.684, Speaker C: No, that makes sense. Kind of related to this. Well, do you guys have any or. Actually, I just like to hear your thoughts on NFT finance or like, NFT. I feel like it was a big thing last year or maybe a year and a half ago, and everyone was like, NFT finance going to be the big thing this year? We had ERC 404s, SPL, twenty two s, a bunch of stuff on Solana, and then now it feels like all of it is just not discussed as much. What do you think of, like, I guess launching, borrowing or lending through magic Eden or Amm pulls, which you guys have, right?
00:49:06.984 - 00:49:42.044, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. No, I think NFT five is still really, really interesting and still has like, massive potential, actually. Um, I think that probably what you are describing about like, some of this stuff being like, less hot right now versus what it used to be. I think that's just a general, it's like a sign of the times in that right now nfts and no one's really even talking about nfts that much. I think, um, there's, we've seen more people just talking about ordinals and runes than just nfts in general. Right. As an example.
00:49:42.044 - 00:50:35.456, Speaker A: And definitely meme coins have been really dominating the mind share over nfts. But I think this is just normal. It's kind of a natural cycle kind of thing. I mean, we also go through periods where no one talks about fungible tokens as well. I remember between 2018 and 2019, basically nobody was launching any kind of token. So this is like very natural evolution in the market. But if we do see more, like the next cycle of NFT spot trading gets another run, then I would say 100% definitely we will see NFT fi also make another run, because in order for NFT five to really, like, have a credible market, you need the spot market to be robust.
00:50:35.456 - 00:51:14.584, Speaker A: That's true for any kind of market. Right? True for fungibles, too. So we have seen, probably from an NFT fire perspective, most of it has, actually. We've seen a lot of it, actually, on bitcoin recently, just because ordinals went through a massive run. There was tons of people borrowing against their nfts, um, their ordinals, sorry. Um, and it's probably going to heat up in the other ecosystems, too. And we, we built amms, uh, on Solana, so you can kind of use amm pull, like, deposit into amm pools for NFT collections on Sol.
00:51:14.584 - 00:51:26.404, Speaker A: And we've actually explored borrow lend on Solana as well, partnering with, with some other people. So you never say never, but I think, uh, the core focus for us, I think, would still be the trading experience.
00:51:26.904 - 00:52:00.870, Speaker D: No, I think that makes sense there as well. And one of the interesting points you mentioned was how no one's talking about nfts right now, and that kind of brings up the nature of cycles and how there has been this bit of a boom and bust in nfts in terms of attention and price action. When you compare even just last cycle to this cycle, how do you think about what's next for nfts? And do they break out of the cyclical nature? Or is that just a fundamental part of crypto as a whole? Impossible question.
00:52:01.062 - 00:52:36.214, Speaker A: As boring as this answer sounds, I just think it's a fundamental thing in crypto. It's kind of like, somewhat. Personally, I'm desensitized to it all now, after seven years of doing this. In some ways, I do think nfts is definitely, like, even more cyclical. Right. Because at the end of the day, yeah, it is like, yeah, they are, like, inherently speculative in some sense. I do think that there will be.
00:52:36.214 - 00:53:12.756, Speaker A: That this will continue over time and we'll continue to see sort of, like, ups and downs in the NFT market. But what is true, I think, is that the catalyst, each time is going to be different. And that's why I think it's pretty cool, like, what we're seeing now with, like, yeah, the last six months, like, ordinals and runes. And then what we're seeing now is like a lot of people excited about, like some like new. New ways to use nfts. Like this, like trading card fantasy top game. Right? It's like, it's slightly like a.
00:53:12.756 - 00:53:46.394, Speaker A: Definitely a twist on how nfts have been used and traded, which is definitely a really interesting catalyst. There will be many, many more catalysts, but just given the nature of. Yeah, these are just. These are assets that are tradable. So that just markets that go up and down. I just think that we're just in for more cycles. For us, it doesn't really impact the way we make decisions or how we prioritize things because, as I said before, we just want to be the platform that's relatively agnostic.
00:53:46.394 - 00:54:19.212, Speaker A: Right. It's like, just be the best place that people can trade these assets that get created in the same way that. Yeah, like Coinbase should just be the place where any type of token can just be bought or sold against USD. That's like their core, core business. I think that's kind of true for us as well, except, you know, anything sort of like on chain value, we want to be part of that. Right? Like any kind of on chain value. No matter what the asset type, we should be sort of the fundamental place where people can, can access that and discover that.
00:54:19.212 - 00:54:26.984, Speaker A: So, yeah, just, you know, up, up, down. Just, just down for it, you know, just, just. Ready?
00:54:29.564 - 00:54:46.434, Speaker C: Perfect. Zed, do you have any parting thoughts for our listeners? What does magic Eden look like in, let's say, six months to a year? Is there anything that you would want them to specifically look into that they would. That they should look, that they should do?
00:54:48.054 - 00:55:13.524, Speaker A: I. Maybe this may be a little bit of alpha for your users. It's like, I think the best surface that they should check out over the next six months is definitely the wallet because there's a lot more coming. Yeah, a lot more coming that I think people will be pretty delighted about. So if you're going to pick one thing to do on Magic Eden, if you're not already on magic Eden, it's. You should. You should download the magic Eden wallet.
00:55:14.384 - 00:55:16.804, Speaker C: Perfect. Thank you very much for coming on.
00:55:17.264 - 00:55:19.804, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me, guys. Appreciate it.
