00:00:00.320 - 00:00:09.945, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I. I can't wait until we're bullish on ETH again. Like, that's going to be a very exciting time. ETH is a money maker, objectively.
00:00:10.105 - 00:00:35.245, Speaker B: Everybody that I've talked to has just stopped bridging over to L2s. Like, it just doesn't like the new L2s. What. What was the last one that you were like, oh, this is worth it. Like, what are you going to do on these L2s? That. And at some point the market realizes that they stop building L2s because nobody else is funding nothing. Set DRX research is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens.

Boccaccio Ryan and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects discussed. What's up, guys? Welcome back to another episode of 0x research. Today I'm joined by Danny, Ryan and Mark from the Blockworks research team to talk about everything that is happening in crypto. How are we doing, guys?
00:01:00.965 - 00:01:01.785, Speaker C: Bullish.
00:01:04.085 - 00:01:05.061, Speaker D: Agreed.
00:01:05.253 - 00:01:20.637, Speaker B: Agreed. Okay. Fantastic. Big, big week, actually. I feel like we actually have some stuff to talk about this week, apart from just meme coins. Hyperliquid announced that they will be launching their token on the 11th of November. Pretty big news.
00:01:20.637 - 00:01:33.099, Speaker B: Before I pull up some spreadsheets and some comps, I want to hear about people's thoughts on hyperliquid. Have you used it? If you've used it, do you like it? How do you view the perps landscape in general, et cetera, et cetera? What are we thinking?
00:01:33.267 - 00:02:11.965, Speaker C: I think first observation is you should not be ignoring hyperliquid. It's rapidly taken market share and has a ton of outstanding reviews. Almost universally from crypto people that I speak with. It's obviously generating meaningful revenue and volume. The most interesting thing here is that this is a very unique experiment in crypto where, you know, starting out as an app chain and, you know, pivoting more general purpose, trying to move towards, you know, more spot assets. Like, we'll see how that. We'll see how that goes.
00:02:11.965 - 00:03:21.053, Speaker C: You know, from our reports that we've written, you guys know that the team increasingly believes like, it's critical to have adjacency to spot assets and asset issuers as it allows you to cross sell more products and generate more fees. If asset issuers don't want to put their assets on your chain, you're going to have a really hard time attracting capital. So it's just something to watch like can they pull this off? I think they're kind of like pivot towards spot assets like really validates that thesis that they feel like they need it to like maintain market share on a go forward basis. So that's like kind of what I'll be watching right? Like as I look out on the on this landscape like everyone's competing for asset issuers. Can Hyper Liquid like do they offer a unique enough experience to attract those asset issuers and like compound volume like it's, it's tbd but like looking at it like post TG is like probably the most important time to start paying attention right? So we'll see.
00:03:21.229 - 00:04:40.409, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree on that post TGE comment but I I want to kind of run over some numbers. So Hyper Liquid is leading in pers volume. Over the past week they've done double the volume of their closest competitor. I don't know if that's particularly relevant for like 7 day data, but if we look at 30 day data they are leading as well. I think out of the protocols that I've chosen I chose the relevant ones. So Jupiter DY DX Vertex GMX Drift orderly and gains and AVO I think they're like 45 46% of volume over the past month and like based on so I ran some numbers and based on Adrift and DYDX comp like Based on whatever FTV over fees they have hyper liquid should be at 2.5 to 3 bill FTV which would put let me go to my next slide which would put points at so this is by the ASXN guys and I also have the Missouri one but which would put points that I think 15 to $20 according to ASXN and up and a bit higher but around the same rate 17 to 20 according to the Masari guys which would make this quite a sizable airdrop.
00:04:40.409 - 00:06:07.267, Speaker B: But like you said Ryan I I mean that cross asset thing is really the big thing is like if are we going to see actual apps launch has been the question for quite some time and from what I've seen there are quite a few apps building on top of it. Now DYDX is also going with a similar approach where they're now allowing permissionless smart contracts under under L1 and I just haven't seen that many apps launching on dydx like or at least like even if you just scrape Twitter rarely see any like apps or anything launching on DYDX versus like if you look at Hyper Liquid every week it seems like my Scraper is catching 50, 60 protocols that somehow mention hyperliquid in their bio and obviously only like two or three of those will go to market. But that's still. And I think like on the one end I get what you mean, but as in like if you're a perps decks, you wanna, you don't really want to isolate yourself. But on the other end, I mean if you can just like win the whole stack, you should go for it. No, it's, it just makes complete sense and I, I feel like I have to preface all hyper liquid discussion with the fact that they are only running four validators in Tokyo right now. Like they're all co located so whatever performance metrics you see are curated is how I'm going to say it.
00:06:07.267 - 00:06:40.745, Speaker B: They're like very like. I don't know if it's going to scale. You know, obviously like when you decentralize it depends on how many validators you add. It depends on like how you decentralize the network. I assume they won't have too many or they'll make it difficult to run so that they get some form of like sui slash aptos type of validator set where it's like 100 to 200 professionals who just like are able to run very, very robust big nodes. But yeah, overall like I'm, I mean we've, I feel like I've talked about on the POD multiple times. I'm super excited.
00:06:40.745 - 00:07:01.361, Speaker B: I think even on my little hyper liquid comps page, Even at a 40% discount, I mean like if we assume that volumes drop 40% post TGE, it's still looking at like 1.5 to 1.8 FTV, which would still make it a pretty big airdrop. So not only am I. What's up?
00:07:01.553 - 00:07:27.313, Speaker C: Sorry. So what's going on here is that you've mapped out as a function of volume and comping it against the largest legitimate persexes in the space that even if volume falls 40% from pre TG, you're still going to get a billion dollar valuation. If you're looking at the average valuation or median valuation across like relevant comps.
00:07:27.489 - 00:07:50.530, Speaker B: I think at me average valuation is average. Like FTV over fees is 24.4 for the relevant like I only picked relevant protocols. There's some that are higher, some that are lower. I just wanted to do it based on like protocols that I care about. Yep, it would be around one bill if it was the average. If we're doing the drift and the DYDX multipliers, it's above 1.5
00:07:50.530 - 00:08:21.361, Speaker B: or around 1.5 to above 1.5 bill valuation and I took Now Hyperliquid doesn't have fee data available. I know that some of their fees go to the insurance pool and some go to the hlp. But just based off like whatever DYDX charges which seems to be 1.5 pips, I extrapolated that to hyperliquid. So this might not be the final final like actual official number.
00:08:21.361 - 00:08:48.878, Speaker B: But I think it's a pretty safe bet to say they're competitive with dydx or else I don't see like as far as I understand they don't really do big market maker rebates. I'm sure they do whatever the industry standard is. The team doesn't really seem like the team to just give away token and equity very easily given that they're very anti vc. But I don't know, it might be wrong. I just made some assumptions and I think it should hold tbd. What do you think?
00:08:49.046 - 00:09:29.387, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I think the most interesting thing that you referenced there is that DYDX is kind of going the smart contract platform way. I don't want to make this a Unichain discussion, but Unichain is also doing the same thing where they're spinning up their own chain. But it's general purpose. I think the app chain thesis, like I don't know, a lot of people are celebrating here. This validates the app chain thesis. What are you talking about? These are general purpose chains. This doesn't validate the app chain thesis.
00:09:29.387 - 00:09:52.595, Speaker C: This validates the desire of any one app to make as much money as possible and own the entire stack and the fact that like people will use that brand to do so if they can. So yeah, I, I think that that's the most interesting kind of trend here that seems to be underappreciated from the discourse that I'm seeing.
00:09:53.255 - 00:10:44.525, Speaker D: Something that I think is interesting is when you look at that list of comps, Jupiter is very near the top there. If you were to say post TGE hyper liquid activity drops off 40, 50% they could be the top of that list. Despite already having a token and just essentially copying the mechanism from a gmx. I do find that interesting, especially in the context of the unichain dydx building out your own chain idea. I think Jupiter has been continually like taking this the opposite direction, remaining on Solana and just like trying to gobble up all of the potential related products in the category across swaps, perps, you know, etc. They're trying to really become that kind of defi hub for Solana and it's been kind of. I don't know if it's been quietly working or, you know, people are just aware that it's working like this.
00:10:44.525 - 00:10:53.335, Speaker D: But I think it's. It's honestly interesting and surprising to see that they have kind of trended up and are near the top of pers volume.
00:10:53.635 - 00:10:53.947, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:10:53.971 - 00:11:19.709, Speaker B: And it's working out for them. I wonder if they're going to start making Meteora, which is their like DLMM product more and more relevant as well because they also have that. I'm not sure if it's going to have a separate token or if it's going to be on the Jupiter token. I really should switch that up. But yeah, I agree with you. It's completely different direction. I guess Solana can support it even though like these days it's a bit difficult to make swaps on Salana that's a bit congested.
00:11:19.709 - 00:11:31.305, Speaker B: We'll see how it gets when it's like peak, peak bull. But yeah, I agree, like they've been, they. They don't have to go off chain because the chain already works and accommodates them.
00:11:31.965 - 00:12:14.005, Speaker D: And maybe just a tidbit to add is that like within the space. I've heard comments that, you know, people talk about Jupiter perps and they say it's maybe not a great experience and there's quite a bit of love for hyperliquid but it's interesting to not see that dynamic reflected in the usage, I guess, is what I would say. I think frequently we see kind of touts of like build a greater product and then you'll see that activity. But I don't know. I've seen lots of negative comments about the Jupyter perp experience and obviously as we're seeing there's a lot of excitement about hyperliquid and we could see post TG that, that dominance flip.
00:12:14.125 - 00:12:36.861, Speaker B: So yeah, I think it's also tough to be excited about a product that already has an eight bill FTV like Jupiter. I feel it may not be like perfectly priced, but I got eight bill. You're not really looking for anything else. It's. It dominates perps on Salon. I feel like it's more like against drift than it is against. If Jupiter can come on your chain, implement some broken.
00:12:36.861 - 00:13:18.275, Speaker B: Not broken, but not as efficient as it should be, peer to pool model perp stacks and can steal all of the volume then like if I'm drift, I'm at least a little bit Worried because you're already like, like based on these comps, they're already semi over. I know comps aren't everything and you need to take into factor like future growth and whatever they can do in the future. But like if Jupiter is eating your lunch with appear to pool model, then like if I'm Drift, I'm taking a step back and saying hey, instead of maybe yapping at hyperliquid on Twitter, I should, I should focus a bit more on my product and make it so that people actually want to trade on it.
00:13:19.215 - 00:13:37.421, Speaker C: Yeah, it's, we can't ignore the execution on Jupiter. They've been really fantastic and again they kind of highlight that the importance of being adjacent to asset issuers. They are, they have the potential to.
00:13:37.453 - 00:13:38.765, Speaker A: Bring in a lot of fees just.
00:13:38.805 - 00:14:17.237, Speaker C: Given they own a lot of, you know, the pieces of the relationship. You know, you can do spot trading here, you can leverage up over there all within one system. Minimizing that friction is incredibly important. But they don't like the problem that I see is that they don't have a cross collateral risk engine which is super important for institutional capital. Now like you can say like okay, they'll build it, whatever, like they can cross that bridge when they get to it. I think the problem there is that.
00:14:17.261 - 00:14:26.049, Speaker A: I think it took drift like 12 or 18 months to build their cross collateral engine. So it's not an easy thing to build.
00:14:26.237 - 00:14:28.057, Speaker C: And we know that not many of.
00:14:28.081 - 00:14:32.001, Speaker A: Them exist in defi and if they do, they're extremely limited in the amount.
00:14:32.033 - 00:15:07.067, Speaker C: Of assets that they can handle. So I mean look, you're, you're coming to this kind of inflection point in crypto where you know, regulation might, you know, get, or we might get some regulatory clarity. And participating on chain will become much more palatable to traditional financial institutions that expect certain features out of the box. And cross collateral is something like obviously a sophisticated institution should expect to see.
00:15:07.131 - 00:15:08.315, Speaker A: When they show up on chain.
00:15:08.355 - 00:15:25.335, Speaker C: And right now Drift is the only player that allows for that. So yes, they are, you know, 1 to 3% of total perps volume at any given time. Like that's a minority market share. But it's up like I don't know, 20 to 50x over the past month.
00:15:25.375 - 00:15:27.111, Speaker A: Or sorry, over the past year.
00:15:27.263 - 00:15:36.515, Speaker C: And you know, they're pretty positioned for like a post fire dancer world, a post regulatory clarity world where like I can't say that for the competition.
00:15:37.175 - 00:16:14.721, Speaker E: I don't want to say Jupiter keeps coming up in many conversations as a competitor to X and Y. And maybe why they took 12 to 18 months to build one added feature this, the cross feature on their, on their purpose because they're building so many other features across different verticals. Like even, even on the distribution side with the app. You know, I think I've spoken about before that they just want to be the one stop shop for most things defi and keep like expanding into that category. And then you know, there's some criticisms on like, for like maybe their purpose in terms of like capital inefficiency.
00:16:14.753 - 00:16:14.921, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:14.953 - 00:16:51.967, Speaker E: How much like TBL that requires to you know, produce volume. I kind of, I was in the capital efficiency bucket for years, but now I kind of see capital and efficiency a little bit different in the sense that having all of this TVL is actually a blessing. It allows you to you and if you're inefficient, it allows you to use some of that TVL in another product. Maybe you know, like not too dissimilar from what Camino is doing apart from like using the TVL that they got from being a borrow lending platform and then using it in other verticals as well.
00:16:52.111 - 00:17:19.398, Speaker B: Yeah, I, I echo your. I didn't realize I was bridging. I actually said this to Jeff on the pod as well. Like dude, like however you guys built this bridging experience because it was near instant and I think they built it all out themselves as well, which it'll be difficult to do going forward as well. Like if they want to build it out for every chain. I'm not sure if they want to do that necessarily. But yeah, it was kind of crazy that you didn't even feel that you bridged like I thought it was just on arbitrum.
00:17:19.398 - 00:17:28.190, Speaker B: It's not. Hey guys. For today's snippet, I'm once again joined by Miguel, who's the co founder and chief scientific officer at nilion. Thanks so much for joining us, Miguel.
00:17:28.342 - 00:17:30.794, Speaker F: Hi Boccaccio. Great to see you again.
00:17:33.734 - 00:17:39.065, Speaker B: So I want to ask about why data is important for AI as a quick overview.
00:17:40.125 - 00:18:24.015, Speaker F: Well, I guess data is the engine that moves AI, right? You find very sensitive data starting from the training datasets that sometimes are private and very sensitive, going all the way through user inputs and prompts and including also model weights. So those three elements are really sensitive and pieces of information and data. And therefore, you know, AI is in essence a data centric thing. You actually are moving and transforming data as you move it and push it across or through an AI model. So it is, it is extremely important indeed.
00:18:24.795 - 00:18:32.775, Speaker B: Perfect and One thing I was unaware of is that there are different levels of AI data with different importance. Can you expand on that a little bit?
00:18:33.235 - 00:19:06.783, Speaker F: Yeah. Essentially there are like three levels. Level one is the things that you do that are public anyway, like your, I don't know, your Instagram posts, your YouTube videos, also your blockchain transactions, they're public. And also blog posts and so on. So that's not really something very concerning to people. Level 2 is like your digital fingerprint. It incorporates your, the cookies that track your browsing activity, your search history, your social media preferences.
00:19:06.783 - 00:20:15.217, Speaker F: Again, that's not something people are really sensitive about. And it's fine in most cases to give that information away. But then comes level three, which is a different ballgame. We're talking here about high value data, which is essentially priceless. I'm talking here about, for example, the things that you would only share with your therapist, all the email messages you've sent, all the things you've said verbally because conversations will be recorded, you know, in real life, the lies you've told, the truth that weren't totally true, your entire medical history, all the things you've purchased, your opinions about people, like what you really think about your boss or your mother in law, and also kind of the things you're not that aware of, like your blind spots, to what extent you are really smart or as smart as you think you are. No, all those, all those things are really sensitive. It could destroy a person's life, either professional or personal life.
00:20:15.217 - 00:20:24.775, Speaker F: So this is a different ballgame. This is something that you would definitely wouldn't like to be sharing with third parties at all.
00:20:26.475 - 00:20:29.035, Speaker B: And how does Nilion fit in here?
00:20:29.155 - 00:21:30.413, Speaker F: Yeah, to begin with, Nilion is a network to store and retrieve AI data. So you can think of it in terms of this secure storage layer that is decentralized and it's making use of these advanced privacy enhancing technologies so that you can be sure that the data is safe. It's not going to be accessible to the nodes running the network. But then the interesting thing is blight compute of course, is the fact that you can compute, run processes and programs on top of that data without having to reveal it or decrypt it or make it public. So therefore it makes it very easy for developers to actually develop programs that are privacy preserving so that make use of that data in a privacy preserving manner. And one thing that I think makes us different is that we are aiming for these general purpose development tools that are based on Pytorch. So we're not Asking AI developers to change their mindset about, you know, the way they do things.
00:21:30.413 - 00:22:41.137, Speaker F: They can just proceed in the same way. They don't have to become experts in, let's say, cryptography or anything like that. They can still use the same tooling, but now it's running on these pet rails and in doing so it's actually protecting everything that is involved in the mix, like the data training sets, the model weights and the user inputs, which is probably the most important thing. And then we have another aspect that makes us unique, which is this innovation I was talking about in our last episode, this DWT thing that is the discrete wavelet transform, this set of techniques taken from image processing and brought into the privacy enhancing technologies world that actually remove the bottlenecks or greatly or vastly accelerate the bottleneck computations around the evaluation of nonlinear functions like the activation functions or the normalization layers in a neural network. And then I would say you're dealing with a network in the end. Right. So we make it really easy for developers to actually deploy it on a real network with real nodes and to incorporate built in payments because it runs everything through our token.
00:22:41.137 - 00:22:50.685, Speaker F: That's what we call the AI vm, the AI Virtual machine. And it's something that we are about to finalize right now and we're very excited about it actually.
00:22:51.985 - 00:22:55.393, Speaker B: Perfect. That all sounds very exciting. Thank you so much for joining us.
00:22:55.569 - 00:22:56.585, Speaker F: Thank you, Bokaccio.
00:22:56.665 - 00:23:38.415, Speaker B: All right, moving forward, we have. Well, this is another big, big news that happened this week is off the grid has gone off the charts. So after off the grid is this new game that has its own Avalanche L1 called Guns. It is a first person shooter, escape Royale, which combines elements from. Doesn't combine elements. It's like easy to think of it as like a mix between Escape from Tarkov and Call of Duty War Zone where like you're looting throughout the game but you're still in a battle royale. The.
00:23:38.415 - 00:24:19.503, Speaker B: I think the main thing that they added is like cyber arms and cyber legs where you can like pick up specific types of arms and legs throughout the game and they give you different boosts. They had. They were the. They're currently the number seventh game on Epic game stores. Most played free to play game, which is huge. At peak October 11, there was 150,000 viewers on Twitch for off the grid content. Daily transactions are still above free mill, which is quite impressive and Daniel Smith might kick my ass for this, but wallet addresses on Godzilla are over 6 mil.
00:24:19.503 - 00:25:34.005, Speaker B: I don't think that really represents the amount of players. But potentially and I think more relevantly it's like this is the first game that has been adopted by mainstream semi. Like people don't immediately just say oh this is just a dog NFT game. There's still a strong number like a decent amount of people who are saying that, but I think they've done a pretty good marketing campaign where they got Ninja, Tim the Tap Man, Shroud, a few other big names like a few other big streamers and they, I assume they paid them to promote the game and it's worked out pretty well. So I think like two questions I have over this is one, what do you do in the case that there's no way to get exposure to off the grid? There's no gun token. How do you as an analyst approach this? And question number two is, and I think Ryan wanted to bring this one up, do you think this changes how gamers view crypto crypto gaming? Because they, they've like, they've always hated it. Have we gone to a point where it's like if Tim the Tap man says it's okay, then everybody will say it's okay or is it? How do we see the landscape change over there?
00:25:34.585 - 00:25:35.137, Speaker F: Yep.
00:25:35.201 - 00:26:31.835, Speaker C: Not an expert on gaming, I poked my head in to the gaming space in crypto once every few months just to see what's going on. There's usually nothing going on however and just as historical observation, like if you look at, you know, what GPS were telling LPs in the crypto space back in 2017, 2016, they're like man, gaming's right around the corner. And you've heard that consistently since and it just hasn't happened. But it's very obviously technology interested people. Crypto has created a lot of financial games. It seems like, you know, the gamers are a very like obvious like adjacent like crypto user base that you know, the space has the opportunity to onboard. So super important to keep up on it.
00:26:31.835 - 00:27:21.915, Speaker C: Really exciting to see this take off. Like the most interesting thing for me is not whether or not this game is going to be successful or speculating on the assets in the game, but what it does to the psychology of gamers that are using this game that like this game and that feel the crypto aspect of it like it could be, that has the potential for, to be that zero to one moment where it changes gamers perception on the space. Because I don't know from what I've seen historically, gamers not only, you know, are uninterested in crypto but they at times Hate crypto, I think mostly due to like the NFT speculative phase in 2021. So we'll see if this can change some minds. To me, that's the most important thing about the story going forward.
00:27:23.095 - 00:28:04.585, Speaker B: I want to just add one thing before we, before I open it up to the floor, but actually two things. First of all, I think that gamers hate crypto because they never really got into it and it was like, like you said, it's such a perfect crypto adjacent space. But most of them missed out on crypto and the money that was made in crypto that now they're like, oh, it's all a scam. I don't think it's the NFT speculation where they just lost money. This is just something that is like anecdotal Number two. I think it might be helpful if I explain what actually happens in the game that is crypto related. So everything in the game, all in game items are NFTs and you earn rewards in the gun token currently on testnet.
00:28:04.585 - 00:28:28.011, Speaker B: And that's really all that there is in the crypt in crypto. Yeah, there's a wallet interface and you have to pay fees. Like gamers will still have to pay fees, but because they're earning gun token, then like it doesn't matter. They're just giving up a portion of their fees. But it's not like the way that I would imagine a Web 2.5 game blew up. It's like very abstracted away.
00:28:28.011 - 00:29:07.835, Speaker B: I think it's like there's still like people understand and they're not shying away. We've seen like digital collectibles be like the term used instead of NFTs for some companies who are using NFTs because they want to stay away from NFTs as far as possible. But one thing I noticed with Godzilla and Off the Grid is that they kind of like they said that they're doing NFTs but they, they hedged a bit. So they were like, oh, we're doing NFTs. But actually it's not bad for the, for the planet because we're using Avalanche and not like Bitcoin. And another thing was like, oh, like you need to own your items or else like xyz that happens. So they're like really going through this.
00:29:07.835 - 00:29:23.517, Speaker B: They're not like shying away from the fact that it's blockchain nft. But they're taking like this kind of almost an offensive. Like instead of getting defensive and saying oh, like in a few months they'll answer it they're very much like this is not bad, we're actually doing something good for you guys and they're not abstracting it away.
00:29:23.661 - 00:29:47.735, Speaker E: I think it also helps that we are long past the NFT mania where you know, I think gamers were getting all upset about blending crypto with gaming because it seemed like a money grab and something only for the wealthy. Whereas this game, yeah, you only rewards to play but it's still essentially free to play and you know, it's still free to play in a sense.
00:29:47.775 - 00:29:48.071, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:48.143 - 00:30:36.499, Speaker E: And you know you can, you can have skins, NFTs and that you know, that you actually own, you can sell them like in many other play other games, you have to party marketplaces as well. But I think it's just that it's free to play, anybody can do it. So there's lower, lower barrier to entry. I don't need to buy a thousand dollar cryptokitty or axie in order to like get my feet Wet. And then NFTs are like have come through the hype and gone through the bust and now for lack of a better word, boring, right? No, like hardly anybody cares about NFTs relative to their, to their, relative to their peak back in 2021. So, so I think, I think that kind of helps with easing it in now as just technology, nothing evil going on here. Don't you dare say that.
00:30:36.499 - 00:30:41.547, Speaker E: It's just tech. It's just tech in the background and we're letting you know this upfront.
00:30:41.651 - 00:31:25.729, Speaker D: So yeah, yeah, I think that's a good point from Mark. I think kind of thinking back on gamers opinions of crypto and NFTs, I do think that the initial reaction upon seeing this and hearing this is, is like the visceral, oh, it's like a cash grab. Like it takes them back, you know, to the times before when people were spending $100,000 on a picture on a JPEG and all the memes of like well I can just screenshot your jpeg that's you know, haha, so funny. I think there's like a lot of that visceral reaction of like this is they're using NFTs, like it just, it has to be a cash grab. Like we've seen what developers do with microtransactions and like pay to win games. So like clearly this must be the same thing. I think Mark's points kind of clear the air on that a little bit.
00:31:25.729 - 00:32:31.663, Speaker D: Like for any gamer that gives this remotely a chance, like it's free to play, you can hop in, jump in the lobbies and you have the opportunity to like, the way that the NFTs in the game work is there's like within the live kind of like PvP lobbies, there are these hex, like basically loot boxes that you can pick up and then extract and when you've extracted them, then you can, you know, you can pay some gun token, however it works to open them up. And Those are your NFTs. So you can completely ignore that system and just play the game and like try to win or you can play and also take advantage of that. So I do think that, like, the way that they've designed it is definitely positive in regards to, like, if anyone that gives it a shot, like, they shouldn't really be concerned with the NFTs because it's not really going to impact their experience if they just completely avoid engaging with them entirely, which is positive, I think. On the other hand though, people are getting very, very excited. They're getting like a little bit off their skis at the moment in terms of like, how exciting and impactful this is. The viewership over the past, like, you know, last week, few days was from sponsored creators playing the game.
00:32:31.663 - 00:33:06.285, Speaker D: So, you know, you can't go and say, well, it had. It was like one of the top games on Twitch. It's like, yeah, I mean, they were paying for those views. So it makes sense, you know, if you, if you hire the top 50, a hundred creators on the platform and you're going to have some of the top views, you're going to get a lot of impressions. So it's way too early to jump the gun and say, literally jump the gun, to say that, you know, that this is like going to solve web3 gaming and like bring it to the masses. I think if you, if you look at the charts, like they. It's dropped off quite a bit, the activity just over the past few days.
00:33:06.285 - 00:33:52.155, Speaker D: I'll just pull this up and show. But you can see the activity spike on October 11th, 12th, when they were sponsoring all the streamers and then the quick drop off in views. Since then there are still quite a few creators playing the game. So that is positive. But I think the bigger question, and the one that Ryan alluded to was if any mainstream or even decently sized creator does enjoy this game and picks it up as a mainstay and can convince some of their audience that it's fun to play as well, then that's where you have a real winner. If it has any staying power, then this, this idea of like having crypto, NFTs, et cetera, like power. The marketplace for a game can, can kind of etch its way into becoming a little bit more commonplace.
00:33:54.055 - 00:34:13.175, Speaker B: We sponsored a Super bowl ad and got the most views ever. That's crazy. Still though, I like obviously we should warn people. I still think it was like at least the team did the right thing. I think if you're getting all that VC money, spend it on actually getting views and getting it a little bit normalized.
00:34:13.335 - 00:34:49.606, Speaker D: Yeah, and maybe I'll caveat that like this is a common approach, you know, AAA games these days. Like I mean you can go and look at historical trends of like games that see a lot of audience and activity and get clicks for a week or two and then they die out. This is like very common within the gaming industry. You know, people, they look at the new game, the creators get sponsored. Like it's a chance to just get some eyes on it, hopefully get people to download and try it and if they like it, they'll keep playing. But more often than not, you know, people open the game, they play it for an hour and they say, you know what, actually I want to go back to playing, you know, League of Legends or World of Warcraft. You know, pick your favorite game that you've been playing for 10 years.
00:34:49.606 - 00:34:54.874, Speaker D: Whatever. It's, it's, it's consistency. People go back to their favorite things when they've tried the new thing.
00:34:55.174 - 00:35:37.559, Speaker B: Especially with battle royales, I think it's very, very difficult to enter that top three of should be Fortnite, Warzone and Apex. I think maybe pubg. But like that, like those three are pretty well cemented that like you said, you have to pay to at least get a chance like to get people to even download your 100 gig game. You have to pay people because or else like I'm not download. It's five hours, I'm not doing that. I think before we move on, I want to kind of bring up the one question that I asked and I'm bringing it up selfishly because I have data on it that I want to talk about. How the hell do you get exposure to something that doesn't have a token? But it's like supposedly the.
00:35:37.559 - 00:36:32.233, Speaker B: Not supposedly. I would say it's like the biggest launch of the year for like a gaming maybe over the last like three years. How do you get exposure to it? So I think I'm just going to keep talking. I think the big thing was at least like from what I've seen on Twitter and Telegram and Discord is That Avalanche is supposed to be it. I on this podcast say that it is not it. Depending on how much, how many validators the Gonzilla blockchain has and how what the like, congestion is, or let's say like the demand is for L1 validators, Avalanche would be making anywhere from 300 to 2.5 $2,500 per month from if they just had 8 validators.
00:36:32.233 - 00:37:13.411, Speaker B: Which I think makes sense because you want the game to be as performant as possible. Which once again brings up the question, how the hell do you make money as a chain that helps other chains launch? Like, at what point do you say, you know what, we can't monetize this very well. Like, what SaaS product would charge only 300 bucks to like, enterprise customers? And that's like your whole business. You just charge like. And it's a very hefty thing. You can have like 300, 400 maximum of these people. Like, realistically, how many L1s are launching under Avalanche? Before I go any deeper into this, I want to say Avalanche did this by design.
00:37:13.411 - 00:37:43.295, Speaker B: They had a stake to validate. Like, they had a stake to validate model before was very expensive. And then they completely went to the other way where they were like, we're going to make it the cheapest place to launch and it's good. Like, it's very cheap, but it's also, it also just means that you're not making any money off of it. So I want to open that up to the floor and basically say, how the hell do you make money if you're a modular or you're enabling modular networks?
00:37:43.815 - 00:38:16.915, Speaker C: Yeah. I think you point out something very interesting. For a lot of chains that are like, in this conundrum of low usage but relatively high fees for the current state of things. Like, you want to lower fees to kind of spur activity on select chains. However, like, for someone to launch a subnet on your thing, like, only $300 is inconsequential. Right. So, you know, do you spur, like, you have to lower fees because you're not seeing activity.
00:38:16.915 - 00:38:44.775, Speaker C: But then when you finally have something that will, you know, make the jump and come over, you're really not accruing any value. It's a, it's a, it's a tough, tough spot to be in. And I probably bet against it. I think that, you know, the way that you make money is get people to pay fees on your chain, not allowing other people to launch new chains on your thing for, like, for very low dollar amounts.
00:38:45.875 - 00:39:24.615, Speaker B: I'm just gonna give two to three more disclaimers. First of all, like that $300, it could be higher if there's a lot of chains launching on the L1. Like if there's a lot of demand for validators, then that could go up to 2500 per. Like if it's 8 validators and then it can also like quadruple and double after that depending on how many validators you want. Second thing is this hasn't gone into effect yet, but it is the plan to do so just so people don't yell at me afterwards and say oh, that actually hasn't gone into effect yet. Well you're building towards it so I think I can judge you based on what you're trying to do.
00:39:26.915 - 00:40:38.073, Speaker E: I mean I agree with the move, I mean the usage before, I mean I was just thinking any entrepreneur trying to build any kind of application in this space and then you have to buy a lot of this random token that you've never heard of in order to begin. It's just such a huge barrier to entry. So I mean moving towards lowering those barriers and just like make it easier, both like from the developer standpoint and from a monetary standpoint for entrepreneurship to start building things and testing things. I think that's a, I think that's a great move. And you know, most if not every single successful company now the biggest giants were always loss making for the first x10, 15 years of their existence, right? And then you know, even things like Amazon just got usage and they got so much usage they had to build infra and that infra ends up being their most profitable thing, right? So like you know, if you can just somehow stimulate that kind of user base, maybe your model changes over time. But you know, they like to say when you, when you know there's this disruptive new consensus mechanism in Avalanche. No man or this is disruptive.
00:40:38.073 - 00:41:20.575, Speaker E: Like I think it was like Bezos who said like what's disruptive is customer adoption, not the technology, right? And so, and you know, when customers change their behavior and start using products, that's what's the disruptive factor. So I think any kind of change that you make moving more towards getting those increased customer usage is in my books a good move. Whether this works for Avalanche or not or any of these other multi chain thesis, I think it's going to be a volume game. Like how big is this pie? Not just, not just within the crypto community that we're fighting now, but how, what does actual adoption look like if it reaches there? I think that's going to be the biggest factor in whether these models work or not.
00:41:22.715 - 00:42:30.185, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with Mark on this one. I think it's, it's a forward looking design and approach. Like I think even if, not that I want to talk about L2s right now, but I think even if you look at sort of the L2 model for Ethereum, it's really the same thing. They're not really accruing anything back to the layer one at the moment but at some point in the future, like if you have this future of thousands or tens of thousands of these things or they have millions of users, then there's, there may be some tipping point where the economics begin to make sense. So I think if you look at maybe like Steam as a comp in the sort of gaming market today, There are over 10,000 games that launch on Steam every year. So not to say that Avalanche is a Steam today, but if web3 gaming really is a thing in the future and they're hoping to have thousands or tens of thousands of these subnets for games coming out, there is a, there is a point at which the economics could make sense. Especially if you, you know, combine that with, you know, if they've got these marketplaces and they're, you know, people are interacting with currencies and doing trading volumes and stuff on chain, it's very far down the road.
00:42:30.185 - 00:42:56.883, Speaker D: It doesn't make sense right now but clearly that's the vision. And then I also want to add, I want to have a, a thesis or a thought on do you get exposure to guns or off the grid? Just play the game. If you're an investor like unfortunately and you missed out on the private round, like sorry, you can wait for it to go public. I think if you're just like an enthusiast in this space, like maybe just play the game and you'll earn some tokens and get some NFTs.
00:42:57.019 - 00:43:53.487, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good point. I, Danny, Mark, I, I think both of you make really good points and I come that Mark, I completely agree. Like the previous model was unsustainable, charging like 500 grand for a 8 validator. L1 is unreasonable and you're also forcing people to buy Avalanche and you make like you technically just have to stake it so you'll get it back but it's, it's way too much of an upfront cost. We'll see on how it works out. I, I still think if you're charging like maybe $300 for your $15 billion protocol and this is like your whole thing now you've stopped focusing on your main net to focus on your L1s and gaming and real world assets are huge and they'll continue to be huge and maybe you'll get a lot of L1s going. I still think it's like at that valuation, I just think it's a bit much, but fair Points.
00:43:53.487 - 00:44:03.079, Speaker B: Ryan, do you have any valuation slash, revenue related or extension related takes that you would like to share with us this week?
00:44:03.247 - 00:45:03.325, Speaker A: Yeah, piggybacking off of all your points on value accrual. You know, there's this constant theme of, you know, are L2s and roll up, are they extensions of ethereum or whatever L1 they live on? And the conversation's still going on. It's been going on for a long time. It was debated at Permissionless across a number of panels. I think like, I think I, like I know the answer. Pretty confident in it. The correct answer is like, who cares if you're thinking about, if you're thinking about what I mean, like, look, if you want to be like philosopher king and think about how things are related and you know what is important from a spiritual or like social perspective, like, cool, go all out.
00:45:03.325 - 00:46:22.609, Speaker A: What matters for a lot of crypto market participants is the value flow and value accrual. And when you look like blockworks, research now has this data across, you know, many Ethel 2s, you can look at the value that, you know, Ethel twos pay to eth, you can look at the valuethat Ethel 2 is accrue from execution, and you can very safely say, looking at this data, that over the last like four months ETH for every dollar that leaves the ETH L1 and goes and performs execution on an ETH L2, the ETH token retains one penny of that value for every dollar for every dollar that leaves in terms of settlement and DA fees. So like quantitatively we can say like, doesn't really matter. Like we know that those things are very economically different and the value retained from ETH is very, very small. So. So yeah, I think end of the day, like it, it just doesn't matter. ETH retains close to 0 of the value.
00:46:22.609 - 00:46:57.111, Speaker A: And like, if you want so you say like, okay, so you know, execution has to 100x to keep up on fees accrue accrued to ETH. Right. Like Arbitrum plus optimism plus base. If you want to keep value capture for ETH token constant, you actually have 200x execution and you're still down 93% from bull market peaks in 2021. So quite a tall order. But yeah, now that we have this data for subs, I'm really excited to see what the market does with it.
00:46:57.143 - 00:46:58.835, Speaker C: I think it'll change the conversation.
00:46:59.655 - 00:47:04.155, Speaker B: Ryan, do you want to run over some of these graphs that you made me put together this morning?
00:47:05.475 - 00:48:00.243, Speaker A: Yeah, you can just look at it as a time series. So I was actually pretty shocked. I was, you know, I, I knew that these were small in terms of execution. I did not realize how small especially settlement would be because theoretically like you got to do a lot of settlement but like I know it's like 32 bytes at a time, so it's like a pretty small number. But like DA is actually more of a money maker than settlement. DA, you know, for every dollar of execution that moves off of the ETH, one ETH will retain anywhere from 10 basis points to 150 basis points worth of value in DA costs and the, you know, value retained from settlement posting that state route rounds to zero. In SEP.
00:48:00.243 - 00:48:25.165, Speaker A: In the week ending September 30, ETH retained 7 basis points of value in terms of execution from like posting state routes. Like it's an inconsequential amount. So yeah, it's from a revenue perspective, it's just like really mind boggling numbers there.
00:48:25.785 - 00:48:46.033, Speaker E: I think to make things kind of even worse, like even If Arbitrum were to 10x its execution, that doesn't scale linearly with data availability costs. You can do things like improve the compression algorithm, you can do things like change the timing at which you post data to the blobs.
00:48:46.089 - 00:48:46.305, Speaker B: Right?
00:48:46.345 - 00:49:21.649, Speaker E: You can switch between blobs and call data and you can do different things to lower your own costs. So like what I'm like now thinking, okay, obviously we want more execution, it's still going to do something. It may not scale linearly. What kind of scales a little bit more linearly? Like what is working at the L2s? And I think it might just have to be number of roll ups. I was looking at this right before the Pod and right now there are 90L tools. I think about that on Ethereum. 40 of them use Ethereum.
00:49:21.649 - 00:50:06.639, Speaker E: As for data availability, so that's 40 L2s that we got in the past three years, right? And then luckily L2 beat also has something called upcoming L2s and there are 90 upcoming L2s and I assume upcoming means any next year. And I looked at that list and coincidentally again, 40 of them are using a plan to use Ethereum for data availability. I mean all of them are using it for settlement. But as Ryan said, that's a grounding error. So I'm just like thinking, okay, so 40 in the first three years, 40 in the next year if you can keep this acceleration coming. And I looked at it on like Sony's L2. Sony wasn't even on the list.
00:50:06.639 - 00:50:47.765, Speaker E: So there's like some that I'm sure that maybe haven't put their Data on to L2betas yet. But if, if L2s can continue to expand at that rate, then maybe next year we can, we can actually get to the blob target of 3 and actually start to see data availability maybe worth something. But then again there's paired ass coming up after that and then full dank sharding. So it's, it's going to be a cat and mouse game between the two. But I think it's, it's still going to be dependent on the num on do we see L2s accelerating and then continuing to do so? Are they going to fall off? I think that's going to be the biggest thing for the thesis.
00:50:48.385 - 00:51:29.599, Speaker B: I think one thing I want to mention about you saying we've had 40 and now we've had 40 as well is this picture which is like my three month old is now twice as big as when he was born. He's on track to weigh seven and a half trillion pounds by age 10. And it's like, like at one point where I'm like, like anecdotally everybody that I've talked to has just stopped bridging over Delta. Like it just doesn't like to new L2s. What, what was the last one that you were like, oh this is worth it. Like what are you gonna do on these L2s? That and at some point the market realizes that they stopped building Altos because nobody else is funding Altos. Like if, if you can.
00:51:29.599 - 00:51:53.099, Speaker B: Or, or we're going like a really insane way where it's like we're putting like slack on the L2. Like every Slack message is an L2 or something like that. Like that's the level that we have to get to because the market's not going to fund L2s anymore. Like eventually, maybe this year, maybe next year we'll do a couple more. Oh, this one's very special though. We're doing a defi only L2 this time. Oh, we have like a liquidity hub under this one.
00:51:53.099 - 00:52:22.535, Speaker B: This one's like gaming focused. At some point somebody's going to say, you know what, stop, let's stop doing L2s, which is. I can see it going more and more throughout the bull. I. I like, but I feel like this is the L2 cycle. Like, unless Eve hits some form of like, ridiculous number where it's like, I think it's supposed to be 10,000L2 is like, Daniel Smith could pull it up right now. But, like, that's the number that's supposed to like, make sense for Eve.
00:52:22.535 - 00:52:41.825, Speaker B: And you can only get that, in my opinion, this bowl, like this run. Because next run, I don't see anybody being like, oh, we have to build more Altos. Like, it's not. I don't. I don't see it being a very fractionalized market. I don't think there's that many users. Unless it's like we do some app chain L2 thesis, then that's different.
00:52:41.825 - 00:53:14.872, Speaker B: And I assume that's what you were thinking as well. Like, I think that's the logical step is if we're going to do a lot of L2s, we're going to do app chain L2s, but then we get back to the point, why not own the full stack? And then we also get to the point where it's like, if you are doing an L2, you want to minimize your cost as much as possible. It just makes sense because you don't want to charge your users. So why the hell would you use Ethereum for da? Like, there's stuff that's a lot cheaper, even Celestia's. I don't know how much more. I think it's 90 cheaper. And then now there's stuff that's 90 cheaper than Celestia, like nuffle nears.
00:53:14.872 - 00:53:32.555, Speaker B: Da thing is like 80 cheaper than Celestia or something. And then we're going to get even cheaper stuff. So, Mark, I think in the end I agree with you. Like you said, where it's like, storage costs are just going to keep getting lower and lower. Yeah, it's just going to get lower and then nobody's going to want to use E anyway, so. And like you said, settlements rounding error.
00:53:33.855 - 00:54:20.825, Speaker D: I. I do have one thought here, somewhat unrelated to the D8 Focus and the settlement focus, but I think seeing the kind of the failure of ETH to choose and select and enshrine like a native L2 and capture those fees for itself by pushing the execution there and then recapturing it by kind of owning that sequencer, this has really opened up the opportunity for optimism to build out a great business model. Since settlement. And DA is so Cheap. The op super chain stack at this point with explicit agreements related to capturing a percentage of revenue or gross profits. Like we have this wonderful dashboard now on Blockworks research analytics. And you can see that like across the chains today.
00:54:20.825 - 00:55:10.221, Speaker D: Sorry, that's transaction fees. If we look at estimated contribution revenues, you know, they're not massive, but you know, tens of thousands of dollars from the chains in this collective. And if we look at L1 expense by chain across the board, we're looking at maybe a few thousand dollars, maybe one or two thousand dollars back to Ethereum. So I think there was, you know, an opportunity for like the ETH community to think a little bit harder about what these economics might look like and how they might accrue back to the L1. And instead I think it was kind of like, well, settlement and DA is going to be incredible. Don't worry, it's going to scale like crazy. But there, there really was an opportunity to kind of like enshrine and capture a significant portion of this, but instead decided to just sort of push that off.
00:55:10.221 - 00:55:25.115, Speaker D: And I think, you know, this, this kind of economic model chased after by optimism. I mean, this could actually work at scale if, if they're able to capture a portion of, of revenues from all the L2s that build in their stack or in the super chain.
00:55:26.135 - 00:55:37.633, Speaker B: I completely agree with you. Every week we shit on Ethan. Every week I say, yeah, I completely agree with you. And probably for the next few months this is going to be the case. At some point we'll hit a bottom, but we'll see.
00:55:37.769 - 00:55:43.305, Speaker A: Yeah, I said this on the lightspeed pod, but I am looking forward to.
00:55:43.425 - 00:55:45.605, Speaker B: Wait, you went on the lightspeed pod?
00:55:46.905 - 00:55:52.285, Speaker A: Yeah, we did a joint episode with them during Permissionless. I don't know if you were informed.
00:55:52.665 - 00:55:53.193, Speaker B: I was.
00:55:53.249 - 00:55:54.033, Speaker A: Apologize.
00:55:54.209 - 00:55:55.285, Speaker D: Blasphemy.
00:55:56.665 - 00:56:30.199, Speaker A: But yeah, so we did that episode and yeah, look, I, I can't wait until we're bullish on ETH again. Like, that's going to be a very exciting time. ETH is a money maker. Objectively. If you look at all the fees that are generated around August 6th, when we had those, or August 5th when we had those liquidation events like Mevin fees went through the roof. It's still. And with the activity leaving in mass, it's still the top fee generating and top one or two chain by Dex volume.
00:56:30.199 - 00:57:03.305, Speaker A: So like, look, the. It's massively bullish if Max Resnick and friends can steer the ship and get these guys to compete with the L2s. I'm gauging that probability day by day I'm reaching out to all our ETH natives to see how they feel about it. They hate it now but that that view is getting air time increasingly and that's super exciting. So we'll see how it plays out and once things start to flip like you know, this can become an eth pod.
00:57:04.205 - 00:57:05.861, Speaker B: Yeah, I miss being bullish.
00:57:05.893 - 00:57:13.053, Speaker A: If you I highly unlikely. Highly unlikely. But. But non zero chance.
00:57:13.149 - 00:57:19.565, Speaker B: Okay, we'll end it at that. Mark, Danny, anything else that you guys want to specifically bring up?
00:57:19.725 - 00:57:25.409, Speaker E: That I am still an ETH bull. It's such a hated asset and I love to see it.
00:57:25.597 - 00:57:26.365, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:26.865 - 00:57:30.401, Speaker D: The whole space will thousand x raise your targets.
00:57:30.553 - 00:57:43.841, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. If you get liquidated you can always get a job. So size up buckle. All right. Thank you for listening. Ryan, Danny, Mark, thanks for coming on.
00:57:43.841 - 00:57:44.465, Speaker B: Have a good day.
