00:00:00.170 - 00:00:12.430, Speaker A: You either make quite a lot of money because you validate an extract value, or as a CFI deFI arbitrator and extract value, or even a searcher which has zero risk but can extract value, et cetera, or you're a sucker.
00:00:15.010 - 00:00:43.706, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We are joined today by Uri, the CEO of Blocksroute. But before that, I really want to give a quick, quick shout out to our sponsor, Hexans. They're one of the most hardcore security teams in web3. Pioneering in ZK and novel cryptography. They are trusted by some of the top tier brands in cryptos, such as Polygon, working on the ZK, AVM, Mantle, Risk, Zero, Lido, one Inch, Newbank, and more. You'll hear more about them a little later in the show.
00:00:43.706 - 00:01:09.906, Speaker B: But if you are coming to our event, permissionless in Austin, Texas, September 10 through 13th, be sure to stop by their booth at booth 832 and say, zero x research sent you for a free web two pen test along with your quote. But anyways, Uri, we're really excited to have you on here. Thanks for joining us. Do you mind starting just telling people what blocks route is and the main premise behind the project?
00:01:10.008 - 00:01:30.186, Speaker A: Sure. Well, hi, Dan. Hi, Sam. Great to be here. I'm Uri, CEO and co founder of Blocksroute TLDR. We're called Blocksroute because we route blocks and transactions. So at the core of what we do, we have infrastructure servers all around the world which send information really, really fast, almost at the speed of light.
00:01:30.186 - 00:02:30.038, Speaker A: So we propagate transactions and blocks. I think our average propagation globally is under 140 milliseconds. So we're not at the speed of light, but we're pretty damn close to the speed of light. And I did my phd here at Northwestern University in computer networks with my then advisor, now co founder, Professor Kuzmanovich. And when we got started, the idea was, well, we kind of went down the rabbit hole of crypto coming from the research side. And when we came up with the idea of blockchain, it was like, well, if we can send information faster, can we somehow help blockchains? And there were some ideas around that, but we really found product market fit when the DFI summer happened, in the summer of 2020, when everybody and their sister kind of like, wait, these guys allow us to hear about blocks faster and send our transaction to them. Back then mining pools.
00:02:30.038 - 00:03:13.590, Speaker A: Nowadays, validators send it faster to them, basically allow people making better trades. So we're kind of like flash boys for Defi. If you know flashboys, the guy who connected Chicago and New York, if you're one millisecond faster than everybody else, and price skyrockets in New York, then everybody rush. And if you're just one millisecond faster than everybody else to hit, let's say, chicago, then you buy there and you profit, and you're better. And so during the DeFi summer, we had all these people who started to use our platform and our network to see other blocks, to see other transactions. To frontrun. This was prior to Flashpot, and before Mev became a thing, sending, like, we didn't call it MeV.
00:03:13.590 - 00:04:05.834, Speaker A: We were the first to offer, let's say, private transaction. Send a transaction directly to the validator. Don't get frontrun, because nobody sees your transaction. So this was like, I think, mid 2020, like July or August or something like that. And so over the course of, let's say, five quarters from mid, basically over the course of 2021, we moved from being a team of 16 people. We build the infrastructure, but we didn't really find the product market fit into. Wait, a company that makes $10 million ARR, and kind of like everybody are using anybody from jump and winter mutant, the largest traders, to an MeV searcher in a basement in Taiwan, who nobody knows who is, and everybody in between.
00:04:05.834 - 00:04:37.138, Speaker A: So they started using our services to see information faster, to send information faster. Flashbot came out. We started to also run a flashbot relay. So, for people who aren't very deep in the MeV landscape, we'll probably dive deeper into that. But mev, the ability to see a transaction front, run it, back run it, capture arbitrage. So when Flashbot came out, we also ran a flashbot relay. All the mev searcher became our customers, because they all want to see transaction and they want to send it fast, et cetera.
00:04:37.138 - 00:05:10.266, Speaker A: Roll forward to the merge and mev boost. Almost a year ago. In two weeks, it would be two years. Well, I don't know when this is aired, but literally a year ago then, we are now a major Mev block builder, and even more importantly, an MEV relay. So we send blocks from block builders to the validators. They choose the best one, we broadcast it. And so we are very deep into Defi.
00:05:10.266 - 00:05:43.210, Speaker A: We're very deep into the mev landscape. A lot of the actors that are using us, I think we peaked in the bull market. Like everybody. I think we were routing one and a half billion dollar of trades per day for our users and customers. So that was like 40% of all d five volume was coming from our users to be sent on ethereum, on BSE, on Polygon, on Salana. Awesome.
00:05:43.280 - 00:05:46.954, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great intro into what blocks route is.
00:05:46.992 - 00:06:23.830, Speaker C: I want to give a quick shout out to Hexins as we explore today's blockchain landscape, let's take a moment to recognize them as a premier cybersecurity provider in web3. Hexins is trusted by tier one projects like Polygon, including a security review on their new Polygon, ZKE, EVM, Mantle, risk zero, Lido, one inch, newbank and more. Get a deep dive into your technology stack with the most comprehensive analysis and cybersecurity consulting. Hexons not only uses widely known methodologies and flows, but discovers and introduces new ones on a day to day basis. With over $55 billion secured, they cover everything from smart contracts to blockchain to web two pen tests.
00:06:24.490 - 00:06:30.582, Speaker B: Yeah, there's been nearly $7 billion of total value hacked in crypto's nascent history, so it's safe to say your team.
00:06:30.636 - 00:06:31.706, Speaker A: Has a lot on the line.
00:06:31.808 - 00:07:01.986, Speaker B: Don't skimp out. Take your security seriously and reach out to Hexans. Don't forget to mention zero x research for a free web two pen test with your partnership and reach out to Hexans at hexins IO. Find them in the links in the show notes, or reach out to them at permissionless. They'll be at booth 832. But without further ado, let's get back to today's episode. Do you mind taking a step back and just laying the foundation for the conversation and explaining what is the transaction lifecycle through Mevboost today?
00:07:02.088 - 00:07:47.794, Speaker A: Sure. So I think it would be easier if somebody isn't really deep in the space. Let's start from the basic and then kind of roll all the way to Meb boost. So you could imagine vanilla Ethereum people send transaction out there, and if somebody is about to buy 10,000 e for USDC, that will push the price of ETH, let's say, on Uniswap. Then if somebody could see that transaction and get their transaction ahead of this transaction, it's going to know the price is going to go up so they can front run this transaction, just get ahead of it and buy it low and then afterwards sell it high. So that is front running. Back running would be if somebody's about to make that trade and he only buys on Uniswap, price on Uniswap will be super high.
00:07:47.794 - 00:08:28.730, Speaker A: But let's say on balancer it would still be low, and the real price would be somewhere in between those. And actually centralized exchanges are the bigger factor here. And so the price on Uniswap would actually be wrong, it would be too high. So back running a transaction is mostly capturing the arbitrage just behind a transaction. And if you do both, it's called sandwiching. Okay? You front run the transaction, buy before it, then the transaction, the victim transaction happens, then your background sales afterwards, and you profit as the MeV searcher, you profit. So vanilla Ethereum people were just trying to get ahead of other people, et cetera.
00:08:28.730 - 00:09:19.722, Speaker A: The next version was, or one big negative externality of that was that gas prices went through the roof, because anybody who tried to get into the next block, everybody are spamming the network with super high gas transaction, try to get into the block. So even I just tried to send you a token or an NFT or something like that. It isn't super important to happen, it doesn't have tons of value to that transaction. But I am in the same game. Worked like the hottest game of capturing Mev and Defi, so it really pushed the gas price for everybody. The next step was kind of like, let's say, okay, let's create bundles. Instead of just throwing it all into the mempool, let's give it to the validator and tell them, oh, if you include this transaction, let's say a sandwich transaction, or an arbitrage transaction, et cetera.
00:09:19.722 - 00:10:28.454, Speaker A: So if you include this bundle of, let's say a sandwich, a front running transaction, a victim transaction, a back running transaction, it would pay you, let's say a dollar, and somebody else does the same thing, but he's slightly better, or he pays more. It pays a dollar and a half, and somebody else is paying $2. So back then it was the mining pools, now it's a validator kind of like choose whoever pays them the most. It's kind of like silo. This entire competition, outside of normal usage, roll forward even further to MeV Boost and POs and the merge. And the idea there was, listen, if each validator would do it internally, or let's say the flashbot idea was that if each individual validator would do it by itself, then if you're a solo validator, you don't have the resources, you don't have the expertise, you're not going to be very good at it. So you'll make four and a half percent APY and let's say coinbase or lido, or attessant, or any of the largest like valid or block demon or figment, any of the largest one.
00:10:28.454 - 00:10:57.086, Speaker A: They'll have an expert team in house to extract them as well. They'll be making 7% APY. And if that's the case, then not only they will make more money, of course they'll make more money. They'll make more money because they're bigger. They'll make disproportionately more money. And this is a centralizing force. If you have 32 east, what do you do with it? Do you solo validator? Do you run a solo validator, or do you give it to Lido? To do it for you? One would give you four and a half percent.
00:10:57.086 - 00:11:40.634, Speaker A: The other would give you 7%. Of course they're going to give. So of course they're going to give it to the largest actor who would be better at it. So this is a centralizing force. And I disagree with flashpots about a bunch of stuff, but I do agree with them that this is a bad thing. And therefore, the idea was instead of each validator building their own block by themselves, they open it to third parties, to block builders. Okay, so instead of the value of the block being dependent on just how good you are at extracting mev and finding arbitrage and front running and sandwiching all these kind of stuff, you just say, oh, anybody who wants to send me a block, do send them my way.
00:11:40.634 - 00:12:09.414, Speaker A: And one would offer you a block, and it pays you $100. The other pays 101. This one pays you 105. You just take the best one, you outsource it. Which makes it that even if you're a solo validator or you're lido or whoever, everybody are making the same APY. And so that prevents this centralization force of validators. Obviously, the other side of it is that that just pushes the centralization into the block building area.
00:12:09.414 - 00:12:55.902, Speaker A: Okay, so you have beaver, you have Rsync, and you have Titan, which are three builders who are now responsible for something like 70% of all blocks out there, which is wild and insane. And you could say, it's that good, is that bad? But stopping here for a second, this is now the landscape of the transactions. As to the transaction lifecycle, you could imagine, or one more piece worth adding is now we have private order flow. People used to send transactions to the mempool. They got exploited. Validator extracted the value from them. So people don't really, I don't like getting clubbed in the head every time I try to use Defi.
00:12:55.902 - 00:13:26.334, Speaker A: Also, for me, it makes Defi terrible. Defi will never be able to compete with Defi that way. And that's like a big part of why the area where I disagree with flashbot. And so a new form of actors started to form from this, which is private order flow and order flow auctioned and these kind of things. Basically I send a transaction, and instead of it just going to the validator, we have a service. Let's say we have backrun me. Okay.
00:13:26.334 - 00:14:12.140, Speaker A: You send it to us, we promise we won't front run you. Okay, which front running is bad? I would get a worse price. As a user, I will get the worst price. But we will. Look, whether you're doing a really good job with your transaction, and if you're not, let's say you only buy on uniswap and you should be capturing it on multiple venues and you're leaving money on the table. We will try to pick that up, and the user will get some of it, and the validator will get some of it, and we will get some of it, and the searcher would get some of it. So if we're talking about the lifecycle of transactions, instead of transaction going to the general mempool, now, they're going whether these are services like background me, whether directly to the builder, whether directly to a searcher, like all sorts of auction mechanisms that are being built around it.
00:14:12.140 - 00:14:49.974, Speaker A: I don't necessarily like we're offering it, and it's better than the tone tip, like getting clubbed in the head and losing all the money. But MEP auction is basically like, oh, you give me the transaction, I'll club you in the head and I'll give you $10, and this guy offers to club you in the head and give you $15. So you still get clubbed in the head. You're just getting being paid for it. It's like, by definition, worse than not getting clubbed in the head, taking it money wise, some of that value is being extracted. You need to front run it or back run it or capture arbitration. There's definitely friction there.
00:14:49.974 - 00:15:35.880, Speaker A: The searchers also want to make money out of it, other people. So by definition, it's worse than if the transaction executed without all these stuff around. But it is better than, oh, just throw it to the mempool and get front run. And so stopping here for a second, if you're thinking about the lifecycle of transaction, you're sending a transaction to somebody, send an NFT to somebody or make it, it doesn't really matter. There is no value to extract there. It could totally go to the Mempool defi transaction, which, in my opinion, are the most important, the most valuable, and the thing I'm really bullish and excited about in crypto, carry with them a lot of value. So if you throw it into the mempool, you're going to lose for sure.
00:15:35.880 - 00:16:15.454, Speaker A: You could imagine maybe it's worth even stopping here for a second. There is a price on Uniswap. ETH is worth $2,000, let's say, now block someone, ethereum every 12 seconds. So 6 seconds later, price on centralized exchanges already changed, right? It's not 2000. Maybe it's 2001, maybe it's 1999. It changes all the time. But when you're about to make a trade and you send the transaction to trade on Uniswap, then you don't know what the price is going to be when the transaction execute in another, let's say, 5 seconds or 10 seconds.
00:16:15.454 - 00:17:11.880, Speaker A: So you kind of have to guess if you're about to buy, let's say, eth for USDC, and the price would shoot up, then your transaction would fail. Okay, you want to buy 2000, but really at 2001, and what do you know? You don't get to buy at 2001. So you have to kind of like, if you don't want your transaction to fail, you have to allow, well, a bit of slippage. I want 2000, but I'm willing to accept up to 2002, let's say just throwing a number. However, if the price would actually go the other way around to it drops, it's like it's at 1900 or something. You're still going to pay the highest amount you are willing to pay because you said, I'm willing to pay after 2002. And if the price went down by $100 or something like 5%, crash people, a searcher would see your transaction, oh, this guy is willing to pay that much money, I will sell him.
00:17:11.880 - 00:18:00.418, Speaker A: I will front like, I will buy ETH, allow him to pay at 2000, and then sell it after him, et cetera. So when you're thinking about the lifecycle of transactions we moved from vanilla Ethereum, you send transactions to the Mempo validator. See them, they put them in a block largely based on when they saw them. And the fee that you pay, highest fee on the top into being like, you send a transaction, it will get front run. So you send it through either an auction or background me or something like that to avoid that and just get it to the builders, not even to the validators. Builders will try to make the best block and offer it to the validators. Now you have a bit of a trust problem between the proposer, the validator, who are about to create the next box, and the builder.
00:18:00.418 - 00:18:51.046, Speaker A: They could each screw the other party. If the builder just give it to the validator like, oh, here's the best block, and maybe it pays the validator $100 and keeps to the builder, let's say $10. Then the validator screw that, take the block, see what the block looks like. Just unbundle all the transaction, extract is the most value yourself, don't pay anything to the builder and just keep all the value to herself. So if the builder just give the proposer the block, the proposer could screw him over. If it's the other way around, the builder say, oh, I would pay you one if just sign this thing blindly for me. Then if the proposer does that, the validator signs it blindly, and maybe the validator sorry, the builder doesn't actually pay, it says, I'll pay you a million dollars.
00:18:51.046 - 00:19:33.410, Speaker A: In fact, he didn't pay him anything. Builder took all the money to himself and disappeared into the sunset. And so you have this trust problem between these two entities, which is why we also, or flash, but introduced a new concept of relays. We run a relay, for example. Basically, we're somewhat of a trusted entity that sits in between, and we get blocks from the block builder and we see that it's fine and we say, oh, here's the best quote that you could get. Sign it blindly and instead of trusting the builder, trust us. There are seven relays out there, blocks, route ultrasound, flashbot, agnostic, block native istos and Eden.
00:19:33.410 - 00:19:44.870, Speaker A: And that's it. It's not a really good design, in my opinion, but we're kind of like sit in between to facilitate all of that. So validators make more money and builders are doing it and not afraid of being screwed over.
00:19:44.940 - 00:20:17.650, Speaker C: That was beautiful. Completely set the scene for what the current state of the transaction lifecycle is, what Mevboost is, how it operates, and most importantly, who are the major players in there? And so you kind of mentioned all of them, right? Searchers, builders, relays and validators. And I have a quick question on a couple of those, to be honest. But to begin so builder searcher integration, there's been a huge rise in this. And ultimately you've mentioned a couple of those builders that are dominating the block building market. My presumption is a lot of them are integrated builder searchers. I definitely don't know that for sure.
00:20:17.720 - 00:20:46.380, Speaker A: We actually have good data, both like intimately, we know these actors, you actually know them too. You just don't know that you know them. Like, all the big builders are actually large CFI deFi arbitragers. This is them, and this is, you know, these names. And so it's like, known to the people who are like DP. And it's not a big secret, but it's somewhat secretive. There are two things worth saying here.
00:20:46.380 - 00:21:13.746, Speaker A: Three. One, builders, generally speaking, are CFi defi arbitragers. Okay? So if you have a lot of, let's start from a different angle. CFI Defi arbitrage is the biggest piece of Mev. People say, well, Mev and cross chain or whatnot, nothing is even close to matter as much as CFI DFI arbitrage. That's the thing. CFI moves in real time.
00:21:13.746 - 00:21:33.562, Speaker A: DfI is somewhat of a sidecar running behind it. And so the prices on DFI are stale, right? We just like uniswap. There was a block. Here are the prices. But twelve second later, prices are completely different. And whoever gets to r of these, I would love to trade against, like, stale prices. Twelve second stale prices all day long.
00:21:33.562 - 00:22:16.870, Speaker A: You always make money. You never lose money that way. Out of all of MeV, something like 60% is being paid by two validators, by CFI DFI arbitragers. But unlike atomic arbitrage, where there's not a lot of risk, and if there is an imbalance between uniswap and balancers, there's a lot of competition. Everybody tried to make it the most efficient way and pay the most to the validator to get included. So, validators of that extract 91% to 99% of the atomic arbitrage and stuff that just happened on chain. But CFI DFI is a completely different beast.
00:22:16.870 - 00:22:42.394, Speaker A: First, it has risk. Okay? You're trying to capture that arbitrage. It doesn't either work or doesn't work. You could find yourself capturing it on one hand and missing the other leg of it. So it has risk. You also need, pardon my language, shitload of capital on C five and on DeFi, right? Let's say, oh, I want to buy a million dollar of ETH here and still a million dollar of eth there. So I need to have inventory.
00:22:42.394 - 00:23:08.470, Speaker A: I need a million dollars worth of eth on binance, or on Coinbase, or probably both and elsewhere and on DeFi. So you need not only to have a lot of money, you need to also have positions and managers. So this is really done by large CFI DeFi actors. So this is not something that you could do from your basement somewhere without a lot of capital. This is like super serious big money. So it has risk. Obviously, they don't do it.
00:23:08.470 - 00:23:45.422, Speaker A: If they're like, oh, there's no edge. They just do it for efficiency, but they don't make money. If they don't make money out of it, they don't do it. And so they don't pass 91% to 99% of the value to the validators. On average, I think the mean or the median, one of them is like 55% of the value go to the validators. The range is between, like, if I remember the numbers from frontier correctly, between 37 and 77%. So it's not, oh, let's extract all the value and we'll try to bid it to the validator and try to get it included.
00:23:45.422 - 00:24:27.378, Speaker A: It's a lot more about the different positions of the different act. CFI DFI arbitragers. If I happen to have a lot of ETh on chain and a lot of USDC on Coinbase at a given moment, and I want to make this trade, and a different CFI DeFi arbitrager sees the same opportunity, but he doesn't have the same amount of money in the same position. Or maybe he has the money, but they have super complicated risk management engines internally. They can't make that trade because that exposed them to eth going down. It's funny, it's bad even if Eth goes up, okay, if you're exposed to something, it's bad. Even if you bought something and it goes up.
00:24:27.378 - 00:24:59.180, Speaker A: It's the life of like a strat arc. And so the winner would be the one that happened to be the most positioned. It's not super competitive, as you might think. So only 55% or so of the value being paid to the validators. Now going back to the builders. So block builders get all the bundles from searchers who capture atomic arbitrage, et cetera. But it is the builders, the CFI DFI arbitrage, who wait until the last possible moment.
00:24:59.180 - 00:25:38.022, Speaker A: If we say that the validator would ask for the block, right, let propose the best block at time zero. They'll wait until the last 100, 200 millisecond or so try to make the best bid, because only then do the, let's say differently, they try to minimize the risk. If they said like, oh, here's the block, I will make it this way 5 seconds in advance. They can't really make a competitive bid because maybe price would change. So they wait until the last possible moment in order to make the thing that makes most sense for them. They kind of know the price on CFI. They kind of know the price on DeFi and try to make the best bet.
00:25:38.022 - 00:26:17.826, Speaker A: And so builders, block builders are the DeFi arbitragers, point blank. And so this is a somewhat centralized, it is a very centralized landscape there. There's a question, does it matter or doesn't it matter? I remember speaking with Vitalik on this when he did like an MeV salon in Vienna. His take was, okay, we're going to have economies of scale. It's going to happen anyway. Let's break the connection between validators and this. Right, what I said earlier, we don't want this.
00:26:17.826 - 00:26:36.486, Speaker A: So larger validators make higher API. We kind of like there's still economies of scale and the larger actors will be better at it. It's just that it happens only at the block building space. And whether that's okay or not okay is for anybody to decide. Did that end of the question or did I just move to a completely different trajectory of rambling?
00:26:36.598 - 00:27:00.734, Speaker C: No, I thought you nailed it. And one of the things you mentioned is actually, you can see in real time when those bids come in, and it's very close, if not directly after that twelve second mark where you see the largest in winning bid come through. And there's a great website I want to shout out called payload de. It does a phenomenal job. It's incredible. It's absolutely incredible. We'll put this in the link, in the descriptions if you ever need to procrastinate.
00:27:00.734 - 00:27:10.610, Speaker C: Time. If you're listening to this podcast, you're already deep in the weeds. So you're probably like us and you're one of us. So check this website out. Ten out of ten recommend you already.
00:27:10.680 - 00:27:27.402, Speaker A: Open friend tech, you already responded to anybody who responded to you, et cetera. You have like 3 minutes. There are stuff you need to do, but you don't want to do it. So, okay, let me burn a bit more time doing something else. Go to payload de and yes, it's like their animation of building the block and how it progresses over time is super cool.
00:27:27.456 - 00:28:05.606, Speaker C: It's super, super cool. So we talked about the integration between searcher builders and how that's beneficial to that operation. But if you look two steps further down the supply chain, you also see the integration with builder relays. So a couple of questions about relays, but first and foremost, to me, it feels like relays are effectively subsidizing the Mevboost system because there's no economic value or incentive to doing so into running one of these. And as you mentioned, there's seven or so relays. I think I wrote this down. So six relays that have 10% more of the block share that actually blocks getting routed through them, and you guys run two of them.
00:28:05.606 - 00:28:16.346, Speaker C: So there's really only five entities that have at least a 10% share of the blocks getting relayed. And so you could put those people at a dinner table. So, ultimately, what do you mean?
00:28:16.368 - 00:28:44.178, Speaker A: You could. If you're at, like, you go to Paris, you literally meet everybody. So, first of all, I want to quote Matt Cutler, the CEO of Block Native. Block native are our competitors, but I also like them a lot, and we try to collaborate as much as we can. And he's like, in the MeV landscape, you're either. I don't remember, you're either the victim, or you're making your money, or you're a sucker, or. No, he nailed it better.
00:28:44.178 - 00:29:28.098, Speaker A: But basically, you either make quite a lot of money because you validate an extract value, or the Cfi DEFi arbitrage and extract value, or even a searcher which has zero risk but can extract value, et cetera, or you're a sucker, you're the user value, you're the uniswap LP. Money is extracted from you, or you're the relay, which, as he said, it's great. We're a small group of, like, a few entities, and we're subsidizing the largest validators in Ethereum who have $25 billion of each stake, and they make, like, let's say 5% out of that. So that's what? Like, one. In aggregate, they will make, like, $1.2 billion per year. And, okay, we got them.
00:29:28.098 - 00:29:52.346, Speaker A: We and block native and ultrasound, et cetera. So there is no incentive to run a relay. We don't make any money out of it. A lot of people are, like, confused. Then why do you do it? And for us, like, okay, there was the merge. It was either flashbot just running a relay and their OPAC transactions, like, censoring, that's not a really good thing. And so we said, let's chip in, let's try to help this.
00:29:52.346 - 00:30:32.360, Speaker A: We were subsidizing ourselves, but we're now trying to actually find a good funding or a good sustainable model for this. I'm actually in the opinion that we could be charged for this service, and anybody who wants to use it, just pay and choose which relays you want to use. But that's a side note. But to your point about vertical integration? There is no incentive to run a relay if you're a builder. Relay like we run a builder, but our builder makes, I think it's like 2% off the block space. We could have make it a lot better if we wanted, but we don't want to. We don't want to compete with our customers.
00:30:32.360 - 00:31:15.140, Speaker A: Like all the other builders, they're using our services, et cetera. We mostly run it to provide additional services for some of our customers and also to be hands on and know exactly what we're doing so we understand what our customers are. So we're running it like flashboard are also doing it. Block native are also doing like we're not CPI deFi arbitragers. We don't make stupidly large amounts of money, especially when the market is volatile and keep half to ourselves. It's a thing that we also run. You could imagine that if any of us who were running a builder were not neutral enough.
00:31:15.140 - 00:31:48.426, Speaker A: So it's kind of like, okay, I run it that, but I don't give my own builder any advantage. If there is a vertig integration between the builder and the relay, then the relay isn't really this neutral entity that sits between the builder and the validator, right? It is just the builder giving to the validator. So as I said earlier, there is a trust problem. Each one of them could majorly screw the other side. And people say, well, the builder can just trust the validator, right? And the answer is no. A validator, no. I solo validate.
00:31:48.426 - 00:32:34.320, Speaker A: I wait until it's my turn, I get a block and I take all the bundles, all the sandwiches where somebody front run and then back run, et cetera. I unbundle it. I just take the front running from each of them and then crush whoever did it. So it's as if you're trying to capture an arbitrage, but you only do one leg and you don't do the other one. It is very similar in dynamics to what, I don't know if you know, sandwich the reaper, later renamed to low carb the Crusader. He asked his name to be changed in exchange for him revealing another security vulnerability in the mev boost like setup. Long story short, he found a way that the validator could screw up, basically sign something and then misbehave or something.
00:32:34.320 - 00:33:12.166, Speaker A: He extracted $20 million, disappeared into the sunset. So like any solo validator who just gets the block from the block builder could do something like that. A relay really protects both the builder and the validator from one another. So if there was integration between a relay and a builder, that protection is gone. It's kind of like, well, you're really just trusting the builder, so that is less of a real vertical integration pressure. I would argue people just won't use it like any of the major values. They're like, yeah, we don't trust that relay.
00:33:12.166 - 00:33:39.390, Speaker A: We'll use all the other relays, but not that one, because it is strongly integrated with a builder. So again, we do run a builder, but it's not really. We almost do it as a service for others, et cetera. We hand the opportunity to make it a bigger, better builder. We're not in that business. That is true for us. And block native and flashbots, some agnostic, and ultrasound and iss don't even run a builder, so they're safe from that direction.
00:33:39.470 - 00:33:57.234, Speaker B: It sounds like you kind of think ultimately, right now, in today's Ethereum, Defi users are ultimately suckers. So I guess, what do you think the ideal end state of this looks like? And what's the best way to internalize this MeV that doesn't just incentivize sucking value out of users'transactions?
00:33:57.362 - 00:34:47.174, Speaker A: I probably have this. I was about to say I have the strongest unpopular opinions, but I think Vlad Zamfir beats me with his idea of time traveling trades, which I only half understood when he explained it to me. Speaking with Vlad Zamfir is always a bit like that. I have a very different take on how the meV ecosystem is affecting defi right now, how bad it is and what we should be doing. So I think the key insight that I have that most other people don't share yet is that MeV is a negative sum game. Not even a zero sum game, a negative sum game. The more value validators extract from Defi, whether that's LPS or users front running, whatever.
00:34:47.174 - 00:35:15.642, Speaker A: If they extract more value, then defi is less useful, right? By definition, that value is not created from. They're not creating value by offering services or. No, no, they're extracting value. It's literally mep minor extractable value. And so they extract value. They make DeFi worse. If Defi is worse and not as useful, then we're going to have less liquidity and less activity in DeFi.
00:35:15.642 - 00:36:03.134, Speaker A: Because if I have $1,000 and I want to buy ETH, where do I go buy it? On uniswap or on Coinbase? In Coinbase, I will get the current correct price. I don't even know what's the current correct price right I am not a high frequency trader with seven monitors in front of me trying to like, okay, here's the liquidity on each one of them. The price right now should be this and put a limiter. I just try to buy it at the current correct price. But because we have these high frequency traders on CFI who constantly arb any opportunity there, then any venue, you go, wherever you buy, you're going to get the current correct price. If you go to DeFi, you will get the worst possible price, right? You'll try to buy it at some price, and if price goes up, it would fail. And if it goes down, you'll still pay the higher price.
00:36:03.134 - 00:36:29.826, Speaker A: Like, you're not going to get the best price by definition. And so DeFi won't be able to compete with DeFi, despite all the good stuff that DeFi has. So I'm a giant defi bull. Okay, DeFi has transparency. It's like this single, always on open. In the context of how the Internet is open, anybody could participate. Single global financial system that we're building here, its value is immense.
00:36:29.826 - 00:36:57.282, Speaker A: I could spend some time jamming on that if you guys want, but its value is immense. But it's not going to compete with CFI, and it's going to stay this sidecarve that runs behind it if it's going to be less useful. And so going back to bytes and negative sum games, validators extract the most mevs that they can. So the DeFi sucks. So there's less liquidity and there's less activity, so there's less mev. And so DeFi stays like a niche. If you have to.
00:36:57.282 - 00:37:20.162, Speaker A: You want to trade Pepe, you can't trade it anywhere else. Okay, you use DeFi, but anything that you could, you use CFI. And my favorite example for that is actually bitcoin trading. So BTC, the highest, largest market cap in the world. Not only that, its c five volume is twice as big as ETH. I'm a huge eth head. And this is kind of like, I am very supportive of e.
00:37:20.162 - 00:37:53.806, Speaker A: But fact is, BTC trading volume is much higher whether you like BTC or don't like BTC. And the question is, do people take their BTC to wrapped BTC or something like that and try to trade it on DeFi? And it's not about, well, you know, bitcoin. They don't trade, they hold. No, they're trading. They're trading it on CFI. The question is, do they also bring the liquidity and activity to DFI? And we're seeing that 99.5% of all BTC trading volume happens on CFI, and just like half a percent or so happens on DFI.
00:37:53.806 - 00:38:33.646, Speaker A: And the reason is that DFI isn't that useful if you're trading, you're better off trading it on centralized exchanges than decentralized exchange and deFi right now. And this isn't inherent, but that's the current situation. So DFI isn't winning right now. From where I'm standing, if we were with like, it could be ten times bigger or 100 times bigger or 1000 times bigger. Okay? I want DFI to compete with DFI, and it's not happening right now to a large extent because DFI isn't useful enough. And so my chip on the shoulder is that DeFI needs to be useful. We want in decentralized, we want everything.
00:38:33.646 - 00:39:19.290, Speaker A: But if it's not useful, we got nothing. Okay? Building the most decentralized system, which isn't useful and nobody wants to use because they're better off using CFI unless they actually really have to use DeFi isn't a good outcome. And so with this insight in mind of like Mev being a negative sum game, I actually hold the following opinion, which is somewhat contrarian. Everybody in the current MeV landscape are aiming at MeV auctions. It's the validator turn. He would try to extract the most value as it can from the block. We have third party block builders trying to feed them that, et cetera.
00:39:19.290 - 00:40:00.202, Speaker A: And the result of that is that validators extract the most value that they can. They're making their slice as big as they can, but it's the biggest slice from the smallest pie in the world. Okay, this isn't a very useful defi ecosystem. And so two points. First is to say the fact that we have that, well, we have MVP boost. So the money doesn't go to jump or winter mute or any of the J, it goes to the validators means squat to the deFi users and LPs, right? Oh, I bleed money, but it doesn't go to winter mute, it goes to the value. I feel so much better.
00:40:00.202 - 00:40:21.058, Speaker A: Right. This really solved the problem for me. And we're going to have mev burn, right? So it doesn't even go to them, it burns and value accrues, in theory, at least, to all Ethereum holders. Again, as a defi user, this doesn't help me one bit. I bleed money, and now I bleed it to all Ethereum holders. That doesn't solve anything. And so that's one point.
00:40:21.058 - 00:40:56.366, Speaker A: And the second was that instead of validators trying to maximize their slice of the pie, but in the process making the pie that much smaller, they should be doing the other thing. They should be thinking of themselves as service providers. And instead of an MEB auction ensures that they get the local maximum right. Somebody bids one east, somebody 1.1, somebody 1.2, et cetera. So they are in a maximum point.
00:40:56.366 - 00:41:36.586, Speaker A: It does extract the most value, but it's a local maximum. And they'll actually make a lot more money if they don't extract 90% of the value, or 60%. If they extract 40%, but of a much larger pie, they're better off. Especially if that pie is ten times bigger or 100 times bigger. And that larger pie, in my opinion, is if we can make DFI compete with CFI specifically, and more important than anything else, you could imagine that if validators give what I call instant inclusion, so think of it like as a pre confirmation. I'm a validator, it's my turn. And now I like, okay, this is one, this is two, this is three, this is four, this is five.
00:41:36.586 - 00:42:00.050, Speaker A: Order it in real time and get paid for it. Okay, capture half a basis point, or a basis point of all volume, then that isn't theoretically optimal. It won't maximize the slice. Oh, why capture just 1.7? You could capture 1.5. It would capture a smaller slice, but it would make DFI useful. You could imagine, again, I take the BTC example.
00:42:00.050 - 00:42:47.954, Speaker A: You could imagine if we just get BTC volume to actually move into defi because it makes sense to LP BTC, you don't just bleed money, you actually make a higher apy. It makes sense to trade there and not everywhere else. Then the volume on DFI would roughly double, maybe more. Because again, BTC volume is twice as much as if trading on CFI. And what if DFI isn't 5% of all trading volume? What if it's 50%? And what is not 50? What if not half of the trading wall? What if it dwarfs c five? What if it goes to being like 500%, which is the future I'm aiming for. Not even talking. Okay, future New York Exchange runs on Ethereum, base, whatnot, et cetera, not even there.
00:42:47.954 - 00:43:35.754, Speaker A: But we're talking about, very realistically being capable of allowing this to happen. Now, a million technical challenges to solve there. How do you prevent front running? How do you propagate transactions so nobody could front run one another? And there are ways to resolve that. What is fair and received order by all the validators? Again, tons of stuff. I'm not saying, well, I have a solution from start to finish, but I have ideas about how to solve anything, it would probably evolve over time. The major question, in my opinion, is, does it pay validators more money if it pays validator more money to offer services instead of extracting value from their users? If they make more money that way, they'll do it. Validators are great actors.
00:43:35.754 - 00:44:14.202, Speaker A: They don't like extracting value. But if they don't, somebody else would, and then everybody would move to stake with them, at least in theory. So they're kind of, like, forced to do it. But if we offer them a path to make more money in a different way, they would love that. And so my own personal crusade is to prove that it pays more money that way. If we can prove that providing instant, real time, pre confirmation, fair ordering things, if the validators could offer that, and it pays better, we can spend the next five years. Okay, how do we build it in the most decentralized way, without builders and relays and MeV surgeries or whatnot, et cetera.
00:44:14.202 - 00:44:16.750, Speaker A: A lot closer to vanilla Ethereum.
00:44:17.570 - 00:44:44.742, Speaker C: Okay, that's super interesting. So, basically, the idea of the theory around instant inclusion would kind of be. You mentioned this earlier, but you described DFI as like this sidecar that every 12 seconds, a new block gets created, and then it catches up to CFI. So right now, whatever the price on finance is, that's the new price on all these dexes due to that sexidex arb driven by the builders. And now it's caught up. But, oh, one seconds pass. 2 seconds pass.
00:44:44.742 - 00:44:58.570, Speaker C: All right, now we're. Now we're lagging again. So, with instant inclusion, the validators would be providing some sort of a service where they could say, okay, I'm going to give you this price right now, even though the block isn't complete, but once the block comes, then you'll get in. Is that kind of the core idea here?
00:44:58.720 - 00:45:29.062, Speaker A: Yes. Let's think of a uniswap LP for a second. Okay. A uniswap LP put his money there, and then every 12 seconds make a really terrible trade, right? It's kind of like east is at 2000 USDC, twelve second pass. And then Price moved to, let's say, 1950. And then the CFI DFI arbitrager makes a single trade, capture all delta, and again passes a lot of that value, or half of that value to the value. It doesn't really matter.
00:45:29.062 - 00:46:06.954, Speaker A: But the LP made one terrible trade every 12 seconds. And then there's a nontoxic order flow of, like, okay, people actually trading against it. But that matters less. If d five moved in real time, then the volume during these 12 seconds is something like ten times higher than between starts to finish, right? Price goes up, price goes down. Price goes up, price goes down, price goes up for 12 seconds, which is an eternity in trading terms. And you could think lps will be trading on the way up, trading on the way down. So they'll be making a lot more trades, smaller trades.
00:46:06.954 - 00:46:59.682, Speaker A: Half of them would be good, half of them would be bad on average, right? They'll trade it both ways. Instead of one single bad trade, they'll make a lot more trades, capturing more fees in the process, even if their fees are, let's say, like three basis point or instead of five. Okay, so you can actually make it cheaper for the user to participate with it, but they'll capture a lot more of the value if we find a way to make defi operate in real time. So, from the uniswap LP perspective, as an example, trading in real time means instead of one bad trade, where he's always being taken advantage, he's really letting arbitragers arbitrage the way up, arbitrage the way down, et cetera. And in retrospect, half of the trades they'll be making were actually good trades and half would be bad, and they'll be making more on the fees. So that, I think, is the spirit. So that's half of it.
00:46:59.682 - 00:47:40.090, Speaker A: If you have $1,000 and you want to buy eth, you want to buy, and you don't know what the price is, but you know that if you send it, instance included, if the price was off, some arbitrager would already come and correct it and capture the arbitrage. So arbitrages actually work for you. They provide a really valuable service. So when you send a trade, you get the car and correct price. You don't care if it's on uniswap or balancer or somewhere else, you don't care what's happening on coinbase or binance. You would always get the correct price because they would move in picoseconds to try to correct it, and they won't front run you, which is like the third piece. People kind of, like, hate high frequency traders and arbitragers.
00:47:40.090 - 00:48:05.462, Speaker A: We don't want to make tradfi again. We don't like the latency war there. The bad thing about tradfi is front running. What's bad about the top high frequency trading firms kind of like operating and they're faster than you. The fact that you're trying to make a trade, they see what you're about to do and say, oh, he's going to buy eth. I will buy eth before him. So the price, this is the bad thing.
00:48:05.462 - 00:48:24.970, Speaker A: Now, we moved like, okay, we take this into Mev and we say, oh no, latency is bad. We don't want to tradphi latency games, but front running is fine. Let's normalize that. No, that's the single most terrible thing. That's the thing. Why we don't like high frequency traders. That's the bad thing about tradfi.
00:48:24.970 - 00:49:02.634, Speaker A: We say, that's okay, but the latency where arbitragers are actually a good thing, a valuable thing, they provide a valuable service in correcting the price. So you don't care how much liquidity there is here or there, any venue. You go around the world. Let's think CFEr. If you trade on Coinbase or binance, or, I don't know, wherever you are, OKX, you'll always roughly get the same price. Because if there is a mismatch, somebody would correct it. Same for DeFi, if prices are corrected in real time, that when you send a trade, nobody sees it, it gets first come, first serve, nobody front run you.
00:49:02.634 - 00:49:39.094, Speaker A: So you don't get, if I'm making a trade and jump is making a trade and they're faster than me, then their trade got in front of me. That's totally fair. That's okay. I'm not trying to beat jump and identify a picosecond opportunity. But if I send a trade and they see my trade and then make their trade and make their trade based on the fact that I'm about to make a trade, that's not okay at all. That means I got a worse price because they thought that's the thing we want to solve for and maybe the third. And for me, the most exciting thing is that if DFI moves in real time, then it's not.
00:49:39.094 - 00:50:13.338, Speaker A: CFI is the real thing and DFI every twelve second kind of like catches up with it. Instead, you're going to have DFI affecting CFI and vice versa. The way Coinbase affects finance and they affect, okay. Like it's going to be a bi directional effect, okay, somebody buys on uniswap, that changes the price on Coinbase, and they're going to affect one another in real time as equal. Not DFI being like a side guard running behind DFI and never actually being able to compete and offer an alternative.
00:50:13.434 - 00:50:24.580, Speaker B: There's just one question in my head that I can't get over, and maybe there's a simple answer to it, but what's the point of solving this at the base layer if the ultimate roadmap of Ethereum is moving this activity to l two s?
00:50:24.890 - 00:50:53.870, Speaker A: That is a fantastic question, and I've been thinking about it a lot lately. There's this notion that centralized sequencer are kind of okay. If we were to talk a year, a year and a half ago, like everyone, no, we have an l two, and it needs to be this decentralization. This is what it's all about. And I kind of like, well, it's hard. So let's start with this centralized sequencer. And they're like, well, it's kind of working.
00:50:53.870 - 00:51:33.180, Speaker A: How about we just keep it at that? Then we have the e one, the l one, security, whatnot. So they can't cheat, they can't steal your funds. If DFI is to become a thing and it's major or whatnot, and everybody are using it, and then Ukraine situation flares up and there's giant tension between the US and Russia, and the US said, you know what, any wallet, here's a list of any individual russian person we could identify. Touching any of them is illegal. It's of king compliance. You can't do it. Coinbase, where is your sequencer? If you touch any of, like, you're out.
00:51:33.180 - 00:52:01.474, Speaker A: You should not do that. Same goes for arbitrage. It's not specifically for base or anything. This is true for any single sequencer, centralized sequencer. So yeah, they can steal your funds, but we just threw them out. Like, okay, let's exclude all these people from participating in this l two, because there's a single entity that can enforce all sorts of stuff or saying like, oh, this Pepe coin, that's a security, don't touch it. Like, don't include any transaction that does.
00:52:01.474 - 00:52:28.986, Speaker A: If you do, you go to jail. So I love l two s. I think they should be decentralized. I think we can achieve a lot with decentralized l two s, but the current landscape is that they're not. And so a lot of people want to. I don't blame people who said, like, no, ethereum is decentralized and I trust it, and I have a lot more trust in it. This is why most liquidity and most activity still happens on l one and not l two.
00:52:28.986 - 00:52:51.950, Speaker A: And when l two s are mature, then this should happen there. Maybe. So maybe it should happen on l one, maybe it should happen to l two. Who am I to say? But I would also argue that's the user choice. If I am a user and I trust Ethereum, decentralized network, and I do not trust, definitely not a centralized sequencer. Well, arbitram, if they decentralize, what would that look like? Well, I don't know. I need to see the details.
00:52:51.950 - 00:53:06.854, Speaker A: But then it could happen there rather than anywhere else. But if you take an l two and decentralize it, you have exactly the same. You just replicated l one. So everything that I just said, true. Okay, let's not do it on l one. Let's do it on an l two. It's the same thing.
00:53:06.854 - 00:54:02.666, Speaker A: So the l two should do first come, first serve, et cetera. Few questions to be asked is, I don't know, if I'm a validator and this pays giant loads of money, do I want to push it away to an l two? If this is the most valuable use case of a blockchain, should everybody else move to an l two? Because this is the real thing and blockchains inherently always only do the most valuable thing and push less valuable use cases out to l two s or not to happen at all should this happen on an l two. There's a great reason for this to happen on an l two. Should this happen on an l one. Also, who am I to say if this should happen here or not? Who am I to tell the user, oh, I know you want to try to trust Ethereum. You don't trust base or op or arbitram or any of the others. But no, take your trading and put it there.
00:54:02.666 - 00:54:22.942, Speaker A: And I don't know, to your question, it could happen on an l two. If all the trading happens on an l two, we need to have exactly the same solution for exactly the same problem there. So it changes little. From my perspective, it's about solving, what do we do when we have a decentralized network of validators who produce blocks together?
00:54:22.996 - 00:54:32.978, Speaker C: It's almost like if you build the working solution on l one, maybe you can map that to l two in some way. And I have a similar question because we had a conversation with Eugene Chen from ellipsis Labs, building an order.
00:54:33.064 - 00:54:34.290, Speaker A: I love Eugene.
00:54:34.870 - 00:54:37.118, Speaker C: He's the man. I mean, incredible.
00:54:37.294 - 00:54:38.354, Speaker A: I like him a lot.
00:54:38.472 - 00:55:18.946, Speaker C: Totally agree. So your first point in one or two questions ago was, okay, well, if we can do instant inclusion, then we get more trades. So lps earn fees on the way up, fees on the way down, and effectively, you're trading both directions instead of that one bad trade. And that makes a ton of sense, because then you're earning fees before that one bad trade occurs in the twelve second block time. So his pitch on why it was Salana over Ethereum was, okay, well, with 400 millisecond block times versus twelve second block times, you get that inherently with Salana, and so you don't have to kind of create this solution to go around it. So what do you think about lower block times and how they impact this.
00:55:19.048 - 00:55:49.750, Speaker A: Lower block times reduce MEP for sure. From the get go, you could imagine that if you're thinking about LP perspective or whatnot, you trade up your trade. Instead of one bad trade every 12 seconds, you make all sorts of trades and then get smaller and smaller. The smaller blocks are, I like Solana. I like Solana a lot, and I like the ecosystem there, and we have solutions there. And I like Eugene and what they're building, ellipsis labs and Phoenix, and a giant shout out to what they're building there. It's a different architecture to begin with, so it's harder to get traction.
00:55:49.750 - 00:56:30.442, Speaker A: So it's this ten x thing. Is it so much better that it will be able to get the liquidity and activity and everything around that? And not only that, the tooling, the ease of a build like EVM is so broad right now that it's very easy to get something up and going. And it isn't as easy to do on Solana right now with the way that they do account, just the learning curve around it. So that's one thing. Second thing, in Solana, I always had this thing with g two labs. So g two are building, like, an mev solution on Solana. I love them.
00:56:30.442 - 00:56:50.382, Speaker A: I think they're great. Like Buffalo and the rest of the team. They're good, they're super smart, they're super technical. And I hate their product. I hate it. I absolutely hate it, because the entire value proposition of Solana is just like a real time trading, whatnot, et cetera. If you take all the important transaction and you stole them for 1.2
00:56:50.382 - 00:57:18.454, Speaker A: second or something, any not important transaction goes through immediately. But anything important, let's put it on hold and try to run an auction for people to extract value from it, you're hurting the value proposition of Solana itself. So if that is the way that's being going to happen on Solana, I think it's hurting that. And I told that to the g two. And again, I think they're great. I think they're awesome. They could disagree with me, we could have a disagreement, and I'm sure they're going to have their own argument in their favor.
00:57:18.454 - 00:57:50.314, Speaker A: But I think it's hurting. And I told that to Anatoly as well. I think it's hurting. The value proposition of salana is like the thing that works in real time and allow for bandwidth, et cetera. Now take, let's go to my solution, instant inclusion, which you could always almost think as virtualized trades, right? It's kind of like the block is going to come in twelve second, but instead of waiting until then, we're doing virtual. Okay, this is going to be one, this is going to be two, this is going to be three. And then blocks are just like checkpoints to these pre confirmations.
00:57:50.314 - 00:58:22.074, Speaker A: So it doesn't really matter when they come in. It would happen in twelve second. As long as I know that the order is already decided upon, then nothing else really matters. These are very similar visions. Now the question is, which would get traction and liquidity and ability and composability with everything else faster. I honestly wish Solana would do well here. I think highly of the Solana ecosystem and the founders, and I think the tech is great, and I hope they're doing better.
00:58:22.074 - 00:58:58.390, Speaker A: I think what they're building is awesome. Would that be what I'm kind of like imagining? You could think. What I'm trying to envision here is if this blows up and this becomes like, compete with CFI and 10,000 transactions. Well, at that point, we need Solana again, right? What's the Bandwidth, how many transactions could be pre confirmed and at what rate and whatnot, et cetera. So even if I'm correct, with instant inclusion, they could come and say, okay, ethereum will take you here and Solana will take you here. Right? You still need Salana if you want this to be like the New York Stock Exchange for real. So that is how I would like.
00:58:58.390 - 00:59:36.118, Speaker A: I think me and Eugene agree on 99% of things, so we have very similar views, I think, on this. It's just I am trying to take the Ethereum ecosystem and push it in this direction, which is, I think it's better. And there's somewhat of lack of self awareness and self importance. Like, yes, I am Uri, and I think everybody else in the room, including some real. I think I love Vitalik and I think he's great, but I think he's wrong on this. And I love field Dayan and a lot of the people on the flashback team, et cetera. But I think they're wrong.
00:59:36.118 - 01:00:04.490, Speaker A: Like the go step blanking on his name crap. So if you hear from them that there is no good and bad Mev. Mev is just like a force. Like, I disagree. Front running is bad and arbitrage is good and whatnot. So we have disagreement. And yes, I am.
01:00:04.490 - 01:00:36.134, Speaker A: Like I come and say, I think you're all wrong and let me try to prove and show you that. And I might be proven wrong, but I'm going to try it one way or the other because I think it needs exploring and it's need proving and say like, oh, no. Well, we have Mev and we didn't come up with any fancy way of solving it. So this is the direction that we're going and it makes deepa useless. But let's do it anyway because we have a good understanding of the auction mechanism and how it works and we're going to have an alternative l one. Right. Okay.
01:00:36.134 - 01:01:02.880, Speaker A: We have swave. So users don't make transactions. They have metatransaction and they go to an auction where searchers try to create bundles and give them on an alternative l one, where block builders participate on multiple, say what? Users make transaction. They come first. The complexity around that and the stuff that aren't solved yet. I'm not sold on it. Okay.
01:01:02.880 - 01:01:38.262, Speaker A: I don't want to be offended. This gives me strong lightning network vibes. We're going to have this. Are we going to have watchtowers? If something misbehaves, we're going to see it. Simplicity has power. Now, that doesn't mean that complex solution don't work or aren't valuable, or they might turn out to be correct and I'm wrong, like it is a possibility or whatnot, et cetera. But understanding the complexities around it and what it would look like and how many new actors are we inserting? And we are relays, right? We talked about we don't have an incentive.
01:01:38.262 - 01:01:58.974, Speaker A: My real incentive is to rug everybody and just grab 20 million and run into the sunset. And I'm not doing it because I have a bigger vision and more money, which I want to do in different ways. But I am running a relay and you guys are all trusting me to do it. There is no coherent incentive plan around it. And so I think I'll stop here.
01:01:59.092 - 01:02:13.202, Speaker C: Yeah, that's such an interactive solution. It's super interesting. But I do have one more question, maybe as a wrap up here is, what's the counterargument against incident inclusion? What do the naysayers say? No, here's why it's wrong. What's the biggest?
01:02:13.266 - 01:03:00.994, Speaker A: It won't work. The argument would be you can't have real first come, first serve. You then have a notion of fairness and you don't know how to achieve it. And there will be front running and what is fair and does it actually work? My PhD is in computer networks, okay? So even before being a crypto guy, I am a networking guy. So my thinking is that if validators make money that way, and they are service providers, you could say validators. Instead of a single proposer building a block and giving it the ability to order transaction, extract value, all validators together create a new block as an aggregate of their perceived order. It's called themis.
01:03:00.994 - 01:03:55.190, Speaker A: It's a system that re jewels from Cornell and Chainlink, kind of like built. Basically the proposer doesn't decide on the order. He receives all the orders from all the other validators and say, oh, here's the order of their aggregate. It can't touch or change anything around it. And so the question is, can it be fast enough? And the second, again, going to being a networking guy, if I send my transaction to all these validators directly, but I don't just do it well, I'll broadcast it and hope for the best and then get front run. What if you start by sending it to the entity which is furthest from you and gradually send it closer to you around the world over the course of 100 millisecond or so, that means that you're being protected by the speed of light. Okay, the one thing that jump can't solve, and the biggest enemy of jump, and they actually have an article about it, is the speed of light, you can't beat it.
01:03:55.190 - 01:04:46.802, Speaker A: So even if they sit next to me and I give them the transaction, and within a pecosecond they identify it and send it to the other side of the world. If my transaction has an advantage of 70 millisecond, they're not going to beat me because it's going to take them another 100 milliseconds to reach there. Like they can't make it faster. So if you send it to the other side of the world and gradually closer to you, I'm fairly certain we could prevent completely front running. And if you could every so often front run, what would be the cost to achieving it and how much? Again, this is my argument needs to be proven with real time. But going back to my, so the naysayers would say what is even fair and you can't achieve it, and we can manipulate it, and you can prevent front running. So whether it's actually doable or not, which are super valid points, I'll go back to my previous argument.
01:04:46.802 - 01:05:18.626, Speaker A: I want to prove that it pays more money. If it pays more money, we can solve all these. It won't work. How do we actually do it? How do we make sure it's decentralized, like everything around it? And people say we can't do proof of stake either, right? I don't know if you've been long enough in crypto, the nothing at stake problem is a problem we cannot solve. We were all doing proof of work, and then proof of stake can't be because you could be doing all sorts. But we solved that. If we have hard problems and we want to try to solve them, we have good technical abilities and iterate over them.
01:05:18.626 - 01:05:42.934, Speaker A: And we had plasma, we had sharding. Now we have roll ups, like all these kind of stuff. But it's only worth exploring if this could be done if it actually pays validators more money. So that's my agenda, like the main goal and first objective. If we can prove that it pays more money, then it's worth doing everything else. If it doesn't pay more money, validators won't do it anyway. So what's the point of trying to solve all the other technical challenges?
01:05:42.982 - 01:06:19.730, Speaker B: All right, I got one more question. Attempt to poke a hole in your beliefs here. So your primary reason for wanting this kind of architecture is so that the DeFi experience is better, because you're arguing that users are leaking value by making transactions in DeFi, but that sex to Dex arb will always be there, no matter what, into the future, because it's just different venues. So do you not expect arb bots to run in there, make gas fees super high, and then ultimately you're left with the same problem that you started with, and that users are paying exuberant amounts of money in gas fees instead of mev.
01:06:19.890 - 01:07:03.954, Speaker A: So that's an excellent question. Two things. For that, I do accept arbitrage. I want them to participate, and they will affect, just like binance affects coinbase and vice versa. So we're going to have this dynamics instead of CPI running ahead, and then every so often, okay, just grab almost risk free trade against stell prices. The risk is only okay, who gets to cherry pick and take all the money from the defi ecosystem? So, yes, I want them to participate. If we build such a system, just like how block builders and others could take transactions or bundles, and if they revert, not include them.
01:07:03.954 - 01:07:31.878, Speaker A: You could have exactly the same thing. Arbitrary will try to send transaction and get included to try. And these would say like I'm trying to make this trade and if it doesn't happen here, revert. It has to happen in this block, in this state here it's calculated and if it reverts because he missed it, right. Three different arbitrage try to capture an opportunity. The first one get in, the others don't, then we don't include that transaction. First of all, we're in a post 1559 world, so like gas behaves differently.
01:07:31.878 - 01:08:34.830, Speaker A: So there'll be usage and that would increase the base fee or whatnot, but to the level of the usage that people are willing to pay. But it won't drive gases the way that auctions did that back in the day where all transactions got in one transaction, hit 90 transaction, revert behind them, just waste gas instead of it. It won't be in the incentive of the validator to include reverting transaction because they'll be getting basis points on volume. If the transaction reverts, it doesn't pay anything, so it's not really worth doing. So that would be my two counters to your poke, right? I do want arbitrage to participate, but to participate the way they participate in CiFi and just like we're preventing waste of gas, of reverting transaction right now with MeV boost and previously with Mevgas, and in the future potentially with Swaybar, whatever, you could do exactly the same thing here. The validators who are creating transaction decide on order and eventually don't include everything that reverts because it's wasteful and doesn't pay them.
01:08:34.900 - 01:08:53.320, Speaker C: In this model, you're basically asking the validator to do more, right. It's got to run this piece of software that will effectively be making that instant inclusion possible. So I guess the question is ultimately how much is that added requirement and does that make it harder to run?
01:08:54.170 - 01:09:33.378, Speaker A: That is an excellent question. Actually I touched upon it a bit with Justin Drake when I spoke at this. Won't only large actors be able to do it and smaller won't, et cetera? And the short answer is no. The complicated part is let's simulate all the potential ways of transaction being including in all different orders and trying to extract most. That is a very convoluted, require a lot of computation and heuristics and expertise to do it. A software which receive transactions and put them first come, first serve and broadcast. Okay, this is one, this is two, this is three, this is four.
01:09:33.378 - 01:09:50.540, Speaker A: To the proposer and the proposer aggregate. That is super lightweight. Super. That's very easy. You could run it on your raspberry PI, no problem. What about bandwidth and transaction? This is just like you send transactions, it's just sending these transactions. It does not add a lot to that.
01:09:50.540 - 01:10:28.926, Speaker A: And maybe third. Well, do you need to run something additional? Short answer is yes, something very lightweight. But yes, do you have to? No, but it would pay you all the mev value that we're trying. If you have 32 e to stake and run that. So 32 e, let's say, what, $50,000 or more? Yes, you can pay on your validator instead of running it on $100 hardware, run it on $150 hardware. Because I'm like that. And you have a proxy and you could accept transactions and you could actually, if this is a thing we spoke about Solana.
01:10:28.926 - 01:10:59.600, Speaker A: Solana have like jump building fire dancer, a different client for Solana. And this is from the people who optimize every single piece of the hardware and software coming from high frequency trading firms. This could be running on the networking card. You could optimize this to run on this to be faster than your fastest computer if you build it and do it on the firmware of the networking card. And we could do that. We have the expertise. This is just identical, like building what fire dancer are doing.
01:10:59.600 - 01:11:19.954, Speaker A: Very doable. A large task, just like building a client is a large task. But we could do it if we find that it pays more value and we want to do it. And yes. Will it happen in a month? No. Will it happen in two? Could, like, it's not that hard to make these get packets, drop them if they're already relevant. All these kind of checks, you could do it on the hardware.
01:11:19.954 - 01:11:23.574, Speaker A: You don't need special hardware. Stronger computer, pay more.
01:11:23.692 - 01:11:34.666, Speaker B: That was an awesome conversation. Honestly, Yuri, like, really appreciate it. This has been one of my favorite conversations I've had in a while, so I'm going to kick it over to you. Where can people learn more about blocksroute and yourself?
01:11:34.768 - 01:11:52.698, Speaker A: Really? Find us on Twitter uri and blocksroute everything related to trading and defi and private transaction and everything. Both in the current ecosystem that we're participating. We're a large actor and both in these futuristic stuff that we're trying to achieve and improve the defi ecosystem.
01:11:52.794 - 01:12:03.770, Speaker C: I love it. If nothing else, Uri is a great shit poster on Twitter, so an excellent follow. We'll be sure to put those links in the show notes so they're easy to the listeners. To find. But thanks again, Uri. This was a fantastic conversation.
01:12:03.850 - 01:12:05.440, Speaker A: This was fun. Thank you so much.
