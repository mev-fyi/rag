00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.918, Speaker A: Is there stuff to do on Solana? Will this change? And. Yeah, what are your thoughts there?
00:00:04.004 - 00:00:11.040, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I got two answers for you. So the second one, which we'll get to later, is, what do you do on ethereum? Because I'm just really interested to see how much fun you're having over there.
00:00:13.090 - 00:00:36.754, Speaker C: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. If you're listening to this podcast, there's a good chance that, like Dan and I, you believe the future of finance is on the blockchain. And we're excited that London is becoming a global hub for blockchain innovation and institutional adoption of digital assets. That's why we're pumped to host the 2024 Digital Asset summit in London this march. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. Later in this episode, we'll tell you how you can save 20% off on your ticket.
00:00:36.802 - 00:00:37.430, Speaker D: What's up, everyone?
00:00:37.500 - 00:01:02.170, Speaker C: Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. Before we dive into today's episode, a quick word from our sponsor, Hexins, the most hardcore security team in web three.

00:01:02.250 - 00:01:23.094, Speaker E: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We got a great analyst episode lined up for you today with one small twist. We're joined by Matt, as usual. But this time we're joined with Garrett Harper, the co host of Lightspeed, a Solana focused podcast in the blockworks family. It's an excellent series. We'll definitely put a link in the show notes. But Garrett, thanks a ton for joining us today.
00:01:23.094 - 00:02:16.246, Speaker E: We wanted to drag you into this just because with everything going on, the recent market know Solana and its ecosystem has been very exciting. So we had to bring in the expert. But I wanted to do a slight little twist today. So instead of just talking about all the good things, let's do a little battle testing ourselves here and do a little bit of an accusation audit. Sam, Matt and I will kind of throw out a somewhat random accusation about the quality of salana in some way, shape or form, and want to hear your defense to this piece. So I'll go first here, which is a little bit uncharacteristic for me, is focusing a little bit on the NFT ecosystem, but metaplex controls about 99% of Salana NFTs, and I want to get your take on why that's the case, first of all, to get a little bit of background on it and what the negative implications are for that and if it really is going to continue to kind of plague or impact the salon NFT ecosystem going forward.
00:02:16.428 - 00:02:49.202, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question, and I'm happy to be here, actually, my first few podcasts I ever did with you three on Empire, so I'm pumped to be back. Also, I used to produce this show, so it's kind of fun to be on it now. All right, accusation audit for Salana. Can I recruit Mert real quick? Because I know you'd absolutely destroy you guys. Okay, so metaplex, the thing is, with Metaplex, essentially, it's a program on Salana that 99% of NFTs go through. So on Salana, they separate state and programs. It's really easy to use programs, which is really cool, but it often means that you have concentration and kind of centralization around one program.
00:02:49.202 - 00:03:24.094, Speaker B: In some ways, that wouldn't really be a big deal, except that Metaplex is the sole party that controls this program right now. And it's like, okay, well, why does this matter? Well, back in, I think it was May this year, they were actually going to implement new fees on protocol transfers and updates. But there's some NFTs, for example, that updated, like daily or hourly based on the weather, et cetera. And people are going to be like, this isn't feasible anymore with my NFTs. So essentially you don't want to have centralized control around these NFTs. Thing is, interfaces will be coming to Salana soon. Their runtime V two is basically an update that's coming Salana in some ways, like as a user, no one's going to be able to tell the difference, but as developer, you will.
00:03:24.094 - 00:03:50.482, Speaker B: It's going to make things a lot cheaper, but also it's going to enable things like interfaces. If you think about interfaces, it's kind of like on Ethereum, you have the ERC 721 standard. If you're an exchange like Coinbase, you can use that interface to interact with different NFTs. Well, on Salana, if you wanted to use a new NFT standard right now, it's not going to integrate with anything. So if you wanted your NFT to show up on Magic Eden, that's not going to be the case. Instead, you've got to use Metaplex's standard, not an interface and then it will show up. But that leaves the centralization problem.
00:03:50.482 - 00:04:02.940, Speaker B: So it is a little bit of an issue today. But metaplex, one, it's in their interest to make this protocol work. So they already have something where they want to make this immutable, where it can actually change. But two, I think interfaces coming in the future will change that.
00:04:03.470 - 00:04:16.862, Speaker E: Does the release of the backpack x NFTs in that whole world, does that changes at all? Do those rely on Metaplex at all, or does backpack kind of refresh and give a new interface that people can interact with?
00:04:16.996 - 00:04:32.722, Speaker B: It's a good question that I should know, but I actually think they use Metaplex. So they use the Metaplex standards, just like if you want to use madlads on tensor that's going through Metaplex, you should have armani on sometime. He's the absolute God engineer of Solana, so you can ask him about it.
00:04:32.776 - 00:04:56.506, Speaker E: Perfect. I love in sticking with the NFT markets here for a second. On Ethereum, they're largely denominated in ETH. The. And, you know, I think ETH Maxis would tell you that's because ETH is such a ultrasound money and it's such a great asset. But is the same thing true for, like, are all the assets NFTs denominated in. Sorry, in Seoul, as far as prices go?
00:04:56.688 - 00:05:22.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the majority of the assets are through Seoul. But USDC is definitely something that's used on the chain quite a bit, too. You'll hear David often put out, like, ETH has this. What is it? The triple point asset theory, which is like, it's a commodity. It's also used as a store of value, and then it's like a productive asset, which is like, staking. And he says there's like a giant hole in Seoul right now. And I think the main point of this is there is a lot of inflation right now, and there's not a lot of fees.
00:05:22.074 - 00:05:41.362, Speaker B: Right. One of the key things about Solana is that there is low fees. Everything's about low latency, high throughput, and low fees right now. And to make up for that, you're going to have a lot of high volume. I think it's a little bit unfair, though, to look at what's going on at the chain today and not what's going to be in the future. Right. It operates more like a startup in a mindset of abundance than something of scarcity, which is ETH.
00:05:41.362 - 00:05:50.330, Speaker B: I think both of those are great, but they're coming about it in different ways, and that's why a lot of people say that Solana will likely be the consumer chain, or at least support a lot of these consumer applications.
00:05:51.870 - 00:06:25.506, Speaker A: I got a question speaking on the X NFTs. So I had some of these mad lads that I got right when they came out, and now I have some soul that I was going to try to do stuff with. I was like, all right, you know what? This is the first time I really want to go experiment in the Solana ecosystem. So I was trying to find stuff to do and I was struggling. So there's like this common trade where people are going to go stake their Solana through Jito and then borrow against it on a margin. Phi and farm points on both of them. I checked out drift protocol, which is like a perps exchange over there, but the liquidity is pretty horrible, so it's not really super easy to trade.
00:06:25.506 - 00:06:43.850, Speaker A: So I was just struggling to find things to do in Solana. At the end of the day, the main value that I heard that people are kind of on right now is go buy bonk. It's the only thing that's liquid enough to trade in high amounts. So I'm just curious, is there stuff to do on Solana? Will it change? And. Yeah. What are your thoughts?
00:06:44.350 - 00:07:01.022, Speaker B: Got two. I got two answers for you. So the second one, which we'll get to later, is, what do you do on Ethereum? Because I'm just really interested to see how much fun you're having over there. But on Salana, yeah, there's quite a bit to do, but there's no argument that Ethereum definitely has more applications. Like one. It's because it launched in 2015, Salana launched in 2020. Right.
00:07:01.022 - 00:07:19.366, Speaker B: That's a big difference right there. I would say that DFI and Salana is having some of a renaissance. And a big thing is a lot of these new projects that are more mature now haven't had tokens. And if you don't have tokens, you don't have incentives, you don't have TBL. That's a big complaint with Salana. Their TbL has been sitting around 250,000,000, which is tiny. It's jumped up to 550,000,000, I think, roughly right now.
00:07:19.366 - 00:07:50.526, Speaker B: But compared to Ethereum, that's like 25 billion. So that's a big difference there. Now, like, you've probably seen this on Twitter over the last week or so, the volume on Salana actually surpassed the TBL, which really just points to efficiency, or you could point to people are trying to game the system, it could be either way, right? People often will just do trash transactions to go back and forth to get the volume up. So I can see how there could be pushback there as well. What I would do on Solana if I was just like talking to a normal person that's non analyst like you. I think drip is actually really cool. Drip is something that's like trying to make NFTs instead of about scarcity.
00:07:50.526 - 00:08:16.474, Speaker B: It's like accessibility and abundance, and it's really connecting creators with people like me, consumers, right? And it's like they're putting out free art every single week right now. So it's connecting you with users, but also it's a way to make money. So they have this patron model where it's called give thanks. If you want to pay, you're a patron of choice. Djin Poet is one of their leading NFT artists, and he's actually from Arkansas like me. And he does all of his NFTs with typewriter, which is pretty sick. That's maybe not for the Djen like you.
00:08:16.474 - 00:08:45.070, Speaker B: If you're a Djen like drift, is definitely good for the perps, then Jupiter, which they do more than 50% of the volume on Salana right now, or they direct more than 50% of the volume. They're an aggregator. They also just launched perps, which has done more volume than drifts over the last few days. And drift is the leading perps product on Salana. So I would say the majority of people actually probably start with Jupiter. And the cool thing is, with Jupiter they'll soon have CCTP. So if you are on Ethereum or you're in the cosmos that has CCTP as well, you'll be able to bridge over really easily.
00:08:45.070 - 00:09:05.366, Speaker B: There's a sports betting application that's on Solana. I actually can't think of the name right now, and even though it doesn't have much volume, it's like all my friends that aren't in crypto right now are sports betting and they're all in group text that I'm in every day. It's like those are the easiest people to get on chain, so I hope to get them in soon. Jito Soul so Jito Soul is a liquid staking product for Jito, which is like the leading MeV client in Salana.
00:09:05.398 - 00:09:05.546, Speaker A: Really.
00:09:05.568 - 00:09:41.334, Speaker B: The only MEB client in Salana, I think back in June is when they announced their points program for Judo Soul, and Judo Soul jumped from 1.5 million soul stake to it's like 5.8 million today, and now 30% of that judo soul is actually used in D five throughout Salana. So I think you're right to say like a few months ago there probably wasn't a whole lot to do. There's also zeta markets, I mean there's plenty of DFI projects, but there just wasn't a whole lot of user, or you could say usage in TVL. I think that's changing pretty quickly. And you've seen that with Jupiter actually launch their tokens and it's just that network effect, right? Like we have the prices going up, which leads to like a wealth effect, which means people are going to play with these products more.
00:09:41.334 - 00:09:50.250, Speaker B: And then also you're going to have aggregators like Jupiter that people. It's the front end of swan in some ways. So anyways, yeah. My question to you is what do you do on ethereum?
00:09:50.670 - 00:10:18.066, Speaker E: Spend fucking fees, dude. I went on a rant on this in our analyst chat the other day, but I was unwinding a position in convex. I had frax Heath staked for a year, just experimenting. It wasn't a large position by any means. And because of that, when I unwound the position I paid like 50% of the yield I earned in gas fees and Gui was at like 30. So today it spiked up like 140. Was not doing it during that period of time.
00:10:18.066 - 00:10:49.046, Speaker E: I waited for a mild point in time where gas was not too unreasonable and I still ended up paying an enormous amount of fees. It is unbelievable. And Matt, you mentioned margin Phi and judo soul. I've been playing around with that as well. And it is night and day when you transact a bunch on Ethereum and then you go over to Solana and you just mess around, even just a little bit. It's night and day. One feels like a blockchain and one honestly doesn't.
00:10:49.046 - 00:11:02.640, Speaker E: It feels like a web page that's not about the app UI by any means. Just actually sending a transaction and it taking a second or under a second. It's nice. It's really nice.
00:11:03.410 - 00:11:34.742, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that. I think Matt, on your point. It is fair to say though there hasn't been enough depth and liquidity on Solana because of that. Like people like martian fi, which is a lending product, they have actually had caps and how much TDL they can have because they've got to be able to liquidate loans. And if there's not enough volume and depth on chain, they can actually do that in a safe way. I think one thing I did ignore that I should have brought up is just payments like Solana, to me in some ways is becoming the shelling point for payments, or at least I hope that's the case. You saw visa, I think this is like two months ago, say that they're going to start settling USDC.
00:11:34.742 - 00:12:01.454, Speaker B: Solana has a lot of payments protocols launching on top of it or like applications. So sling is a really cool one that was more or less highlighted a lot at breakpoint. So sling, it looks a lot like Finmo. You can fill up your wallet with USDC just using Apple Pay, which is pretty cool because on and off ramps to me are like the biggest part of crypto. They also have code which is supposed to be kind of like cash. And essentially you just send links around. Like I could right now pull up code, you could pull up code and I could send you $5 over this.
00:12:01.454 - 00:12:21.026, Speaker B: So payments, I just think the low latency and the high throughput of Salana and also the composability make it like a shelling point for payments. So, Matt, you wouldn't really want to play with payments on chain. What are you going to do? But the average person uses payments every day, so hopefully that we get a real world use case, not just dgens like you guys that are using crypto. And that's going to be the base for Salana.
00:12:21.138 - 00:12:57.618, Speaker A: Yeah, I think those are all fair points. Like today, really. The main uses that I see people using, ethereum and its l two s for kind of perps and derivatives, a little bit friend tech and whatever you want to call that kind of social phi. You could argue gaming and then of course, more than anything like speculative gambling on. So like, while Solana doesn't know, have as much ability for those actions yet, I guess you could totally argue and probably completely fairly that that's not going to be what scales this to a billion users. So it doesn't really matter at the end of the day that Solana doesn't have these kind of crappy use cases. And also, I think it's interesting to think about all those different points you were talking about, like margin five points and jeto points.
00:12:57.618 - 00:13:14.140, Speaker A: When those airdrops do come out, that's like a shit ton of liquidity that just automatically gets injected into the Solana ecosystem. Jito could come out at a billion dollar FDV, potentially, whatever. I don't want to speculate on that, but at a very high FDV, and that's just brand new TVL in the Solana that didn't exist the day before.
00:13:14.590 - 00:13:37.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I think these points are huge. I know, I'm rambling. This is my first time not to be a host of a podcast. Love to be the guest, but Tensor is one of the leading NFT protocols on Salana, and you can see how powerful these points, and obviously tokens will be back in February this year, they had 2% of the market share, and then Blur happened on Ethereum, and they did that point system, which absolutely skyrocketed for a bit.
00:13:37.428 - 00:13:37.614, Speaker E: Right.
00:13:37.652 - 00:13:51.750, Speaker B: And then right after that, Tensor came out and they had points as well. It wasn't truly called points, it was like loot boxes. And they went from 2% market share to 20% and the 20% to 60%, and they're still sitting at 52. So it just kind of shows you the power of these points and incentives and what it can do. Yeah.
00:13:51.820 - 00:14:25.982, Speaker E: One thing that I'd love to see, which I think you're going to start seeing, too, and especially with it sounds like that was a huge theme at Breakpoint, is like people are building things, right? And you've seen a lot of that experimentation occur on ETH and ETH L two s. Like, for example, Athena launching a stablecoin. That's super interesting. I think you're going to see that spread. And those ideas not only just get mapped over to Salana, but get iterated on, because you can do more on this type of chain that doesn't have fee barriers and that is low latency and that is high throughput. So there's like a different type of app you can build. But it is going to be interesting once we start seeing that come online.
00:14:25.982 - 00:14:55.466, Speaker E: Right. First you have to come up with the idea, then you have to get funded, then you have to actually build it, then you have to deploy it. So there is this huge time gap that you have to wait through once the idea is first ideated. But you think Athena as an example, they use staked death and then run a delta neutral hedging position on that. They use staked as the collateral to create this stablecoin. Right. And do you think that Sol intentionally focusing on not being money has any impact on the defi ecosystem as a whole?
00:14:55.648 - 00:15:25.590, Speaker B: It's a good mean in some ways. I wouldn't say. I don't know if ETH isn't money. I mean, if you talk to Anatoli, he would definitely say the point of Sol is not. It's not for it to be money. It's like silver resistance. Sol is also used in a few other things, like over this last year, people probably knew in 2022 that Slana had some network issues, right? A few outages, but they implemented something called quick, which is really just network stability, and also stake weighted Qos, which means quality of service.
00:15:25.590 - 00:15:55.360, Speaker B: And so now how it works, if I have, like, imagine I'm a validator and I have 1% of the stake, that gives me right to 1% of a block. So I can have 1% of the transactions go into that block. Now, that doesn't really matter unless the block is full, because otherwise I could just put in a transaction anyways. But in the future, when there's more transactions on chain, that's going to give even more of like a supply sink for Salana, for Sol. Because if you're one of the validators that has a high amount of stake, you actually have a right to that block. Which kind of gets to the point, like, can validators survive on inflation alone? The point is they won't. They don't have to.
00:15:55.360 - 00:16:29.650, Speaker B: This right here will be a revenue stream for them, the more stake that they have, because a lot of RPCs, for example, don't have their own stake, they would then pay these validators that have a large amount of soul to be able to get their transactions in and also get their transactions in on time and in a fast way. I do think it'll be interesting. I mean, soul is definitely more about abundance, less on scarcity. I think the ETH meme is great. I don't know. I also just think that the more people that use Solana, more apps that are built on top, you have to have soul. And even if you don't have to have soul, because there is account abstraction already on Salana, it's going to be Sol used to pay these fees.
00:16:29.650 - 00:16:52.560, Speaker B: And I don't know. I think for something to be money, for the most part, you have to have a lot of people to hold it, and you're not going to be on the ETH L one holding ETH, for the most part, if you're a normie user, it's just too expensive. What I think ETH will continue to be money in crypto for sure. I think that's going to be hard to kind of, like, break that positioning. I think they've won that in some ways. But I also think Seoul will have aspects of money as well. That whole money in this conversation is pretty interesting.
00:16:52.560 - 00:16:58.820, Speaker B: I don't really know what is money and what is not, but if I use it to buy things in crypto, then I guess it's money.
00:16:59.350 - 00:17:35.486, Speaker D: Do you think the fate of Solana, I guess sole token price, let's say that, and maybe like the flourishing of its ecosystem over the next six months is largely dependent on how these points programs actually shape out. Because we just saw the Prisma points program kind of play out and people got absolutely screwed. And obviously this gets kind of complained about a lot because the whole points programs like you don't actually know what you're getting. I know one guy on our team farmed points for a while and could only cash in for a T shirt or something. So hopefully that's not what a lot of projects are going to do over there. But I'm curious if you have any thoughts there.
00:17:35.668 - 00:18:14.246, Speaker B: Yeah, that's another good question. I think points are interesting in one way, and that it allows the protocol and the developers of these economics to actually put something out there into the world and see how everybody responds without actually committing to having a token. Not only do you have regulatory issues, but you also just have like do we really? Some people drop all their token in one go, they blew their like do you really want to do that upfront or can you play around with points? The other thing is, like you said, it really can mislead people as well. So I don't know, I think there's pros and cons of points. I do think these token drops and how Jupiter does with theirs right now. So they have announced they're going to token drop. They're actually talking with the community and so forth to see how they want to do it.
00:18:14.246 - 00:18:40.306, Speaker B: So they haven't announced how that drop is going to happen. It is good for these projects. Now, I think that they already saw the high FDBs happen in Salana before FDX and how badly that went. And then also some of the airdrops have happened in Ethereum. So you can kind of learn what is the good way to do that and that you could compare that to even like Salana doesn't have some of the same tech debt as Ethereum because they saw Ethereum for a few years. I think the bigger thing for Salana in the long term at least will just be like fire dancer is a big one. We don't have to go into that yet.
00:18:40.306 - 00:19:09.354, Speaker B: But Ethereum had EIP 1559 and that's what the whole community kind of got around. And same with proof of stake. And the equivalent in some ways is fired answer, which essentially is just a new client that's supposed to be like ten times more performant for Salana. And right now it's one of those things like it's like pre token is sometimes better than having a token. It's like pre revenue is better than having revenue. Because if fire dancer just continued to get delayed, for example, that could be a big problem. Also, if you're introducing a new client that's written a new language, it can be really hard to actually read from us people.
00:19:09.354 - 00:19:36.518, Speaker B: Like, it's an esoteric code base and that maybe then starts the fragility of the network over because it's not hardened, right? Like, you release fire dancer could have a bug in it, right? And if everybody switches over to it, that's an issue. So I think fire dancer right now is probably the biggest thing for salana on like a two year timeline. Because as of now, fire dancer is supposed to go live on testnet in the second half of 2024. If that gets delayed by like two years, like Ethereum with Pos for like five years or whatever it was, that's not going to be good.
00:19:36.684 - 00:20:04.380, Speaker A: Comparing fired answer to 1559 might be like a bit of a reach. I think 1559 made ethereum go from more or less unusable for a general user to something that I don't know if people here remember, but you could wait 10, 20, 30 minutes for a transaction to go through and you had no idea what gas fee you should set. So 1559 really did make Ethereum. Like was zero to one moment for Ethereum. But I see what you're saying as far as fire dancer will make Salana a lot better, and I'm excited to see that.
00:20:04.910 - 00:20:42.006, Speaker B: I agree. My one pushback, even though this is not what the Salana community will choose to do, I don't think is like all the numbers that you see with fire dancer run on today's commodity hardware, like what salana validators are running. So technically, if it's ten times more performant, you could really just lower the resource requirements for a Salana validator, and that would make it more approachable and accessible and democratized according to everyone at Ethereum. Are they going to do that? I don't think so. Instead, it's going to be like people switch to fire dancer and you'll have ten times faster speed and throughput. And then it's like, what can we support with this? But if they really wanted to, to say like, okay, we can actually just make our validator requirement lower, then, similar to you said, it makes it more usable. That EIP 1559 made Ethereum more usable for the average user.
00:20:42.006 - 00:20:46.410, Speaker B: Well, this would make Salana more usable for the average validator node operator.
00:20:46.750 - 00:21:02.350, Speaker D: I got another question for you here. What do you think about people's claim that the supply overhang from the FTX estate, Nowameda estate, is just too much to overcome because there's been 24 million souls sent to centralized exchanges? Do you think that's a legitimate headwind, or are you not concerned?
00:21:03.170 - 00:21:52.810, Speaker B: To me, no, it's a short term issue, for sure. Salana's whole thing used to be like we're chewing glass, right? Which people respected that term, and that it meant that if you're developer on Salana, you're, like, working drew all this hard, like code base, and there's no real frameworks, et cetera, that were built out, but then they actually got kicked in the teeth when FTX imploded, and so they were 100% chewing glass. But I think the community has come out stronger than that. And now that you just have these FTX cells, to me, in the short term, for sure, it's going to be some pressure on the price, but it's a really good thing. I heard Chris Berniski talking about back before FTX imploded that he didn't want to get in the Swana ecosystem purely because he saw it as like a VC chain. But after FTX and this estate sale, that narrative, it's already kind of gone away. But that narrative will definitely go away, because if anything is taking that VC or trader stake and is going to distribute to more people now, who knows? Maybe it goes to one more VC.
00:21:52.810 - 00:22:01.182, Speaker B: I don't think that's going to be the case. So I actually think in some ways, long term, this is really positive for the network, because if Solana was always the chain, I wouldn't care about it, and I don't think a lot of other people would.
00:22:01.236 - 00:22:27.782, Speaker E: What's up, everyone? As we explore today's blockchain landscape, let's take a moment to recognize as Hexins, the premier cybersecurity provider in Web three. Hexons is trusted by tier one projects like Polygon, including a security review of the new Polygon, ZKE, EVM, Mantle Risk Zero, Lido, one inch, Newbank, and more. Get a deep dive into your technology stack with the most comprehensive analysis in cybersecurity consulting. With over $55 billion secured, they cover everything from smart contracts to blockchain to web two pen tests.
00:22:27.846 - 00:22:48.446, Speaker C: There has been nearly $7 billion of total value hacked in Crypto's nascent history. So it's safe to say that your team has a lot on the line. Don't skip out. Take your security seriously, and choose Hexans. Don't forget to mention zero x research for a free web two pen test with your partnership, and you can reach out to Hexans at Hexens IO or find them on the ground at Devconnect. Without further ado, let's get back to today's episode.
00:22:48.558 - 00:23:18.006, Speaker E: I don't want to name names here, but I have a real complaint about Solana protocol documentation is so bad. One thing that Ethereum projects have, like, it took a while, but they figured it out. Now, docs are good in Ethland, let me tell you that. You can open a tab and there's a contract list of every relevant contract for this protocol. That's beautiful. And that definitely took a while to get to. And there's one thing I heard from people that were at breakpoint.
00:23:18.006 - 00:23:53.766, Speaker E: So let me know if you disagree with this, but it sounds like a lot of the developer community of these new protocols I was mentioning earlier is people that have really never interacted with ETH or bitcoin before. This is like a new wave of developers coming in. And so that concerns me about doc quality, because if you're used to digging around DFI applications on Ethereum or the L two s and so forth, then you know the pains of having good docs and having bad docs. And this makes a world of difference, especially for people that are trying to learn about a protocol. So that is a legitimate complaint that I have, is some major protocols in Solana have a really pitiful docs to.
00:23:53.788 - 00:24:13.866, Speaker B: Be very, very good and legit complaint. I think that's probably gotten a little bit better over the last year. Armani, for example, he's been huge on top of this, like, trying to establish frameworks and documentation. But now you've even seen Mert from Helios, who's my co host on Lightspeed. Like, he's really big behind this. I know you've read some of the blogs from the Helios website.
00:24:13.968 - 00:24:14.730, Speaker E: They do a great.
00:24:14.800 - 00:24:40.378, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But we definitely need more researchers in the space that are writing this out and also developers just for the documentation. Like, John Charb came on our show. He's like, when I came to crypto, there was no way I wasn't going to Ethereum, because I'm intellectually curious and where could I actually read stuff and learn that was Ethereum? Solana didn't have that. I'm really going like bullish Slana on this episode. I don't have only good feelings towards Solana, to be fair. But I would say that in some ways, though, this is actually like another positive sign for Slana.
00:24:40.378 - 00:25:18.906, Speaker B: The fact that you have so many developers in the ecosystem and also users without this documentation is similar to like, hey, people are using crypto today, even though it's kind of shitty to use and it's really hard to have a wallet, but that's actually really bullish. Anytime you see a product that's kind of shit, but people are using it anyways, it's usually a really good sign because those things will be fixed. Like Anatoly would say, this is an engineering is a documentation problem. Obviously, that you're talking about. It's a little bit different, but in some ways I would say that's actually extremely bullish. And the big thing with Solana, to me, the documentation might be shit. But if you're an Ethereum developer, it's like, where are you going to build? Do you build on Ethel one today? Do you build on the roll ups? Like, this process is kind of shit, right? Like, okay, well, I can build on arbitrum, I can build on ZK sync.
00:25:18.906 - 00:25:45.714, Speaker B: I don't know where I'm going to do it. Are they even ready? Like all the bridges have multi sigs and they're updatable. Are my users going to know where to go? That experience isn't very good. And Slana's whole focus to me is like trying to. The documentation might be bad, but their sole focus is giving a bigger and easier design space for application developers to come on top and build. And that's why you need low latency, that's why you need high speed. That's why token 22, which is a new upgrade like token program that's coming out, is going to make things easier for developers.
00:25:45.714 - 00:26:02.510, Speaker B: I think their whole thing is like, we don't know what application is going to be built in crypto, but let's make it as easy as possible. And Ethereum is going to get there. But their main focus right now is we just need to learn how to scale. So if you're looking at those two ecosystems, which one is more likely to actually bring in the developer that's going to have that great app idea, to me, that's Solana.
00:26:03.090 - 00:26:03.758, Speaker A: I love it.
00:26:03.764 - 00:26:09.206, Speaker E: I love it. All right, we've been putting you in the hot seat, so let's flip it here. We appreciate.
00:26:09.258 - 00:26:12.594, Speaker B: Real quick, real quick. I got one more. Stay in the hot seat then.
00:26:12.632 - 00:26:13.662, Speaker E: Stay in the hot seat.
00:26:13.726 - 00:26:43.226, Speaker D: He's just so bold up on this. And I'm just looking at DFI llama 24 hours per volume is 17 million, which is a joke. Stablecoin volume before the last month and a half run up was the exact same that it is today. And if you switch TVL to sole terms, it's down only from 17 million to below 10 million today. To me, that doesn't signal anyone else is using the chain now that wasn't using it two months ago before the price run up. What do you think of that? To me, it seems like no one's using it.
00:26:43.328 - 00:27:03.038, Speaker B: Yeah, those are strong numbers, and I agree. I mean, the numbers on salon are still pretty bad. I don't know who these users are, but even Phantom tweeted out, I think today that over the last two weeks, they've had 100,000 new wallets sign up. So I don't know where they're going. Maybe they don't know what to do. So I think this is a big thing in Ethereum as well. Your first time to get a crypto wallet, what do you do with it? You don't really know.
00:27:03.038 - 00:27:27.378, Speaker B: So one thing they're trying to do, that phantom dead as they integrated with drip, where now when you come in, it almost has like a guide, like, get your first drip in FTE. So I think that's something they're trying to solve. But yeah, the numbers are pretty abysmal. But I think the thing is, the tech is there. Let's be honest. Like six months ago, no one was talking about Solana, except maybe when I started doing this podcast. And then people that are native to the ecosystem, everyone's like, is it dead? Like this December? That's changed.
00:27:27.378 - 00:27:48.334, Speaker B: Pretty mean. I know, I'm just of going on a tangent from your question, Sam, but I think I kind of have to because, okay, to skip to it, like, Salana to me is net new. And the reason that they have to be net new, like they're net new and that they have to go after new applications and new developers and new users. And why is that? And that's because there weren't really that many. There. Obviously, there's a joke that there's 75 developers in Salana. That's not true.
00:27:48.334 - 00:28:11.138, Speaker B: There's actually a lot, but there's not much TVL, there's not a ton of usage. There's not a lot of apps that really worked in the past. Whereas ethereum, you're an L two, they're mostly going after Ethereum users because they're like, we already have this giant basket of users. We're just going to make that app that they're using faster we're going to put it on L two. We're actually just going to migrate our protocol to an L two. Salana can't do that because they don't have the TVL sitting there and they don't have the users. So if anything, they're having to go after net new applications and net new users.
00:28:11.138 - 00:28:36.346, Speaker B: If you want crypto to be what it is today and you're happy with that, let's just use the applications we have today. That'll be great. And sure, Ethereum is doing it right. If you think that crypto can do more than just having our little group of people on our telegram, then that's something that Solana is trying to do. So to be fair, yeah. Right now, Solana is not there with the numbers, but I would say that they actually have hardened defi protocols that stuck around after FTX, which is really cool to see. If I was them, I would have probably left as developer.
00:28:36.346 - 00:28:57.986, Speaker B: But you have some truly genius people working in the space. That's what I like about crypto in general, is you have so many smart people in the space I would have left otherwise. You have that. You have people like Rune coming out with Makerdao talking about the SVM, right? I don't think he actually understands SVM that much. Actually heard him talking about it. He doesn't, but he thinks that it has the lowest amount of friction. And for somebody like Maker, they need a lot of low friction if they're going to do these micro payments.
00:28:57.986 - 00:29:13.342, Speaker B: And then you had visa coming out on Salana, you actually have these announcements. But I think the thing you can argue about is that Salana has good tech. The SVM is good tech. Isolated fee markets. You're going to need that on l two s, like parallel execution. It's probably going to need that, too. And so just the tech is there.
00:29:13.342 - 00:29:25.982, Speaker B: You obviously have the attention. The attention is there. We're talking about it right now. And you see it on Salana. You now have the price. I mean, the price went down to $8 from like 250 or whatever it was. Right now it's like, from the last month, it's from 20 to 63.
00:29:25.982 - 00:29:39.266, Speaker B: It's like sitting at 57 today. So the price is there. You have the attention, you have the price, you have the tech. Now you just need the users. And to me, all of crypto needs users, but at least they have everything else, so they're ready for that next step. And hopefully we have another cycle in crypto.
00:29:39.458 - 00:30:25.782, Speaker E: Yeah, that's why I'm super excited about the next six months, again, because you have that time lag of creating these new protocols, and I feels like we're getting it there. So this last segment has really made us sound like the other three of us really sound like ETH Maxis, which is really not true, ironically. But it was a bit for show just for the sake of hashing out some of these really interesting topics about Solana, because I think that there's a lot of reason to talk about these, especially when price starts going up. Twitter just gets almost unbearable, to be honest, and with all the amount of noise going on. So it was fun to kind of just jam on a couple of these ideas with you. But like I said, we had you in the hot seat for the last 30 minutes, so let's flip the rolls here and I'll give you the floor to put someone in the hot seat, or the cool throne, whichever one you prefer for today.
00:30:25.916 - 00:30:52.062, Speaker B: Okay. I already talked about Jupiter some because they were going to be my cool throne. So I will do a hot seat to continue on this Ethereum theme. And I'm also a big fan of Ethereum, by the way, like you said with Dan, but I'm team Salana right now. So I think that Ethereum l two frameworks are highly overrated, and there's going to be a massive competition, even though right now everyone's like Kumbaya. So you have a lot of podcasts with like arbitrage and optimism will go on at the same time. That's really great.
00:30:52.062 - 00:31:21.286, Speaker B: It's also great to have a meme that they're working together and this is going to be amazing. But yeah, I don't think that's going to happen. It's for a few reasons. I think the reason that you had these roll ups and especially the frameworks, so you have like arbitram one, but then you have arbitram orbit. So when I'm talking about frameworks, I'm talking about like arbitram orbit, I'm talking about hyperchains, and I'm talking about optimism super chain. I think those all came out of the result that just like a year ago, we didn't have isolated fee markets and parallel execution wasn't really a thing or wasn't really heard of by people in theorem community. I mean, people in theorem community knew about it, but they didn't really acknowledge it.
00:31:21.286 - 00:31:30.054, Speaker B: And I think right now you're seeing eclipse with the SVM come over to ethereum. They're basically saying, we used to think we're going to need a lot of a framework. We're going to have app chains use.
00:31:30.092 - 00:31:32.086, Speaker E: Eclipse, but they're like, people don't really.
00:31:32.108 - 00:31:58.926, Speaker B: Need this, or most applications don't need this. We're actually hoping to just have eclipse, the one roll up that everyone's going to be on top of. I also think that these l two tokens through these frameworks aren't going to do very well. And the reason for that is the more competition that you have, which is assuming that these frameworks all live a great life together and don't have great competition, is that it's going to commoditize them. And if you're ethereum, that's great. ETH is going to be used throughout these ecosystems. So ETH as an asset is going to do wonderful.
00:31:58.926 - 00:32:13.926, Speaker B: But it's the whole concept of commoditize your complement, which is a really dumb example. But if you're a hot dog, you're not competing with hamburgers, you're competing with the bun for the hot dog. You want that bun to be as cheap as possible. So everyone, if they only have $10 in their pocket, they'll spend it all on the dog no one cares about.
00:32:14.108 - 00:32:17.814, Speaker E: Back in the econ class with learning complementary things.
00:32:17.852 - 00:32:46.130, Speaker B: And that to me is what's going to happen. If there's true competition, then you don't have purchasing power as an L two. Now if you have what I think is going to happen and you have these power law outcomes, and instead you have like, I don't know, three roll ups that have 90% plus the value, and then you have app chains like DydX, et cetera, that's still going to exist, then you do have some purchasing power. And Ethereum does have to be able to offer data availability and so forth at a reasonable cost or everyone will go to Celestio or they'll launch their own chain. So anyways, my hot seat is l two frameworks. I don't know who wants to defend them.
00:32:46.280 - 00:33:35.546, Speaker A: I'll argue your point of that. Parallel execution makes l two s dump, because at the end of the day, sharding like Ethereum's original scaling roadmap was pretty similar to parallel execution as far as you have different shards that are in parallel executing different transactions. And the reason that Ethereum developers decided to go a different route was because it forfeited composability or synchronous composability between different shards. And the problem there was a lot of crypto wants to touch the same state. So having a transaction that touches Aave and uniswap at the same time is not possible when Aave is on one shard and uniswap is on the other shard. I'm pretty sure, if I'm not mistaken, I'm not a Solana expert, but I'm pretty sure the same is true with the parallel execution in Solana, meaning that you can't in parallel execute two transactions that touch the same state. On I don't.
00:33:35.546 - 00:34:31.326, Speaker A: I think that Ethereum developers made a conscious decision to go a different route as far as scaling through roll ups instead of scaling through a mechanism that could be conflated with parallel execution. So I'm not sure that's a completely fair argument. Additionally, I think that today the roll ups we see are 100% competing. Right? I do think that we're in this very competitive market. The ZK roll ups haven't really even come to fruition yet. So I think that this kind of like biz dev grant program knife fight is only going to heat up more and more. And you brought up a good point maybe five or six minutes ago about how, if you're a developer looking to build a product watching the EVM, how do you even choose where to go? And the answer is, who's going to give you the most money? Which Bizdev program, which Bizdev team or grants program is going to throw you the most money to come build there? But to some extent, that might actually give these ethereum ecosystems a leg up in being able to attract developers compared to Solana, where if you want to code in rust, even you're going to be able to do that on arbitrum soon with stylus.
00:34:31.326 - 00:34:46.630, Speaker A: So I don't know. I think that we see a more competitive landscape of trying to get app developers to come build there, especially in a bull market when these treasuries become worth even more money. And I feel like these ethereum l two s are going to have a leg up on Salana.
00:34:47.290 - 00:35:34.920, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm definitely really excited about the idea of one single shard, baby. I love isolated sea markets. I think they're genius. Parallel execution is how the world works, and there's no reason blockchain shouldn't be on the same wavelength there. And Matt, to your point, you don't lose atomicity with parallelization, but if there were, you just have to literally execute transactions that touch the same state. They can still happen within the same block, and they can still be conditional, right? You can only execute if a certain other need, but they just have to be literally executed within the same thread, so you still get atomnicity and atomic transactions. It's just those particular transactions need to be on the same thread in a certain order.
00:35:34.920 - 00:36:22.230, Speaker E: And so that's why I'm glad you mentioned eclipse, Garrett, just because that's going to be the proof case here. The users today are on Ethereum mainnet for whatever reason, and putting a parallel execution environment on top of that is really exciting, especially when you pair it with Celestia DA. It should be cheap. Still, assuming Celestia lives up to the hype and provides cheap DA, and then you have the transaction throughput from the SVM and you have the settlement in liquidity from Ethereum Mainnet. So we've talked about it a lot. So I don't want to keep harping on it on this podcast, but Eclipse is going to be a really exciting venture because you'd have to imagine that if you're building an app on Salana today, you've at least had the conversation of, hey, do we deploy on eclipse? Does that make sense for us?
00:36:22.380 - 00:36:48.160, Speaker D: Yeah, I would just echo Matt's points. Honestly, I think for as long as l two s can launch at $10 billion FDVs and use those tokens to incentivize behavior on your chain, you're going to retain the users, you're going to retain the liquidity, and it doesn't matter what someone else does, because unfortunately, crypto is a game of incentives today. And until we get that killer consumer app that you're hoping lands on Salana, I don't really think it matters. Lt is a win for the time being.
00:36:48.610 - 00:37:33.686, Speaker B: Do you think that's going to happen on the main optimism? I don't know if it's optimism one, then you have arbitram one, or do you think this is actually going to be the framework where you have like, base obviously building out, there is no other base in crypto. Like, they had 100 million users, that's why they have base. But do you think other projects are going to do that? Because in some ways I feel like these frameworks for develop, it's because there weren't isolated fee. You know, you see, I hear people talk a lot about like, well, if you're a project, you want to be able to accrue your own MeV to your token, and I get that. And on a monolithic layer or an integrated layer, that is much harder. But even with Solana's isolated fee markets and that separation of state and the programs they are already working on ways that you can actually, because you have those local fee markets to your specific state and app, they're working on ways where you can actually accrue that revenue to your app itself. So I think you lose that argument.
00:37:33.686 - 00:37:43.650, Speaker B: And also, there's no more we need to have our own app chain, because if there's an NFT mint, it's going to clog our lending protocol. That's not a thing. So why else are there these frameworks?
00:37:43.990 - 00:37:46.482, Speaker D: When you mean frameworks, what exactly do you mean?
00:37:46.616 - 00:37:51.326, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe I have the wrong word. It'd be like optimism super chain.
00:37:51.518 - 00:38:25.566, Speaker D: I think the idea behind these frameworks, alliances between different l two ecosystems with their own token, is honestly trying to get a flywheel network effects going. So that way devs come build on your stack, users are there, capital comes there, people are building out solutions to really hard problems like Interop and L two s. So I think that's the main reason why they're going for these l two s or forks of your own code base ecosystem of l three s. I think they just want to get enough developers and users kind of stuck there to where everyone has to try and solve the hard problems that.
00:38:25.588 - 00:38:26.880, Speaker B: Haven'T been solved yet.
00:38:27.570 - 00:39:03.078, Speaker A: I think it depends on the roll up ecosystem. So like Sam was alluding to with optimism or Zk sync, it's all open source, anyone can go fork the. So like all you're really getting is soft network effects where developers coming and building better tooling is going to benefit your ecosystem and benefit future developers and maybe bring more users in. But for something like arbitrum, it's completely different. I think. Actually, I'm not sure about Starknet, but for Arbitrum, in order to build on the arbitrum stack and to build an orbit chain, you actually have to use a sequencer on Arbitram and drive revenue there. Or, well, at the end of the day, your transaction has to be included in the general message inbox on Arbitrum.
00:39:03.078 - 00:39:37.240, Speaker A: So basically user sequencer. So it's like actually potentially driving value to the ArP token when you expand this ecosystem. So actually, unfortunately, it seems that kind of optimism is eating arbitram's lunch as far as attracting developers. Because like you're alluding to, why would you ever want know, give up that revenue, that ability to order transactions that you see in Solana and that you see in optimism if you're going to go build an app chain over there? But I think it's all evolving, actually, there's an interesting avalanche improvement community proposal right now that I think we'll probably bring up later. That's kind of relevant in this conversation as well.
00:39:38.010 - 00:40:29.480, Speaker E: To me, this kind of just goes back at the idea of why do we need l two s? Is we're just building extended general purpose blockchains, right? They're not app specific. And that's like a whole nother argument. But why do we need these general purpose l two s? It's because we can't do everything we want to do on ethel one. And so, I don't know, Garrett, I tend to agree with you sometimes when you start getting into the nitty gritty of this stuff, but I just get this disgust, honestly, what are we doing when we have the opportunity to build out all these other chains that don't necessarily need this? And I'm not saying there's not problems there, right. There's still very hard problems that need to be solved. But if you wanted to just build, if you wanted a global state machine, then why are we going to l two s and having to do this, creating all these new sets of problems just to solve the same problems?
00:40:30.250 - 00:41:08.442, Speaker B: Yeah, it's that conflation of modular and app specific, because when everyone was like, modular becomes the buzword. It's like, oh, everybody's going to have a modular blockchain, which then people were like an app chain. But those aren't the same thing. And that's what you see with eclipse. It's modular, but it's not an app chain, it's just one l two. And I think that's where things have changed a little bit. And I think it's interesting, too, that a longer bear market, actually, I think, benefits Ethereum, because right now there's so many complications to me, at least on Ethereum's roadmap and, like, shared sequencers and these centralized contracts that we have, or I should say with multisigs that are on there, just like l two s have training wheels on right now, right? They're not completely ready to scale.
00:41:08.442 - 00:41:39.766, Speaker B: You don't really have the law of chains on optimism figured out all this interoperability is not solved yet. And the end, yeah, it'll probably be solved. But similar to Vitalik's endgame that I think he wrote in December 2022, maybe he talked about the end of the day, Salana and Ethereum are going to be pretty similar in the sense that you're going to have big, beefy builders, and then hopefully users at the end can just verify the chain, right? Like they're going to have light resources to be able to verify the chain. Salana can't do that yet, but they do have the scale today. Ethereum is getting close to having light clients. I don't think that's really a thing, but obviously the node requirements are pretty low. But it doesn't have scale yet.
00:41:39.766 - 00:42:16.758, Speaker B: So to me, if crypto actually took off in the next year, Salana is there to be able to support that, whereas I think Ethereum would struggle quite a bit. I had a tweet on this the other day, who knows if this would happen. But I said, if you had a bull market today, the fees on l two s would skyrocket to some extent. They're going to be much lower than Ethereum L one, but they will skyrocket to some extent then because of that, maybe if eclipse is actually ready to go, you'll have some users go to eclipse. If you go to eclipse, you can use a salona native wallet, or you can use metamask because they have metamask maps. And then if you download a salana native wallet, hopefully maybe you'll start to check out Salana itself, because you see, that's where the majority of the DFI applications are and the liquidity. So I don't know, that's kind of what I'm thinking.
00:42:16.758 - 00:42:41.710, Speaker B: It's just like if today l two s aren't ready to actually scale, Salana is. But the longer that Ethereum has to figure out the roadmap and figure out this interoperability. Great. Mert talks about like, he's a mathematics guy, he's way more technical than me, but he says Ethereum and Salana have the same end game. Ethereum has a lot more conditionals to get to that end game, meaning each conditional is some factor that has to work out. And if that probability is lower than 99%, you keep multiplying them over and over and over. It's like, this has to work, this has to work, this has to work.
00:42:41.710 - 00:42:54.718, Speaker B: You eventually get to like zero, right? Whereas Salana is like, it's got not a complicated future roadmap. It's not easy, but it's not as complicated because you're that one global state, right? So I think that's kind of the bullcase for Salana.
00:42:54.814 - 00:43:23.514, Speaker E: My only pushback to that on the l two fee side is like, how price sensitive is the average user to a transaction? When do you start carrying? Is it $0.50? Is it a dollar? Is it $3? Is it $50? Where's that line? And if you look at l two transaction fees today, they're all basically sub $0.50. I'm quickly pulling something up here. Yeah. So Ck sync at about $0.16. Optimism, eight. Arbitrum, 19 and base about $0.05.
00:43:23.514 - 00:44:00.950, Speaker E: That was looking at last month's data. And if those doubled, do you lose any transaction activity? I tend to think no. Me personally, as a user, if it's under a dollar, to me, I'm just rounding that thing down to zero. But I am not like an mev bot. There's definitely some applications on Salana that rely on seriously high transaction counts. And so that's like, I could see how there's different apps that have those very specific use cases, but on l two s today, those don't really exist in the same capacity at least. And so I just don't think users are that price sensitive, to be honest.
00:44:00.950 - 00:44:05.400, Speaker E: I think anything ballpark, a dollar is like, game on.
00:44:05.850 - 00:44:36.726, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. I'll have to run here in a minute, but I'll give my last little rant on that piece because that's the best thing about Ethereum right now today, is that you do have price and sensitive users. I mean, I do think let's just act like Tpen, which is kind of an exciting narrative that's in Salana. If that is something that could help start the next bull market. That can't be happening on l two s that don't have isolated fee markets because those payments are so small, they're micro payments, that any spike in fees is just not going to work. So that is a use case that wouldn't work. Now people betting on assets going up, which is really like the main liquidity crypto right now and where most of the usage comes from.
00:44:36.726 - 00:44:51.010, Speaker B: I think you're right. Ethereum is mostly insensitive. And there's this whole comparison that's come out. Solana is similar to Apple, and then it's vertically integrated and that it's less complicated for developers to build on top of. And then you have Android. That's something that's more modular and developers can play around with. And that's like the EVM.
00:44:51.010 - 00:45:08.046, Speaker B: I agree. That's a cool analogy. But where it falls apart is that Apple is the one with price and sensitive users, which is really what Ethereum has, right? You want to have Apple's users to buy your product. You want to market to those users because they're LTV. They spend so much more money than the average customer. And that's what's happening with Ethereum customers today. Solana doesn't have that.
00:45:08.046 - 00:45:24.554, Speaker B: The people on Solana. They say Solana is for the poorers. I hate that meme. But that's what they say, right? It's like to me actually the more interesting thing in the future is maybe similar. And this goes into the whole inflation debate. You're going to have a lot of revenue there probably come through advertising, you're going to have these applications that come on board and they just use Solana as a back end for payments, et cetera. And maybe some of that advertising fee.
00:45:24.554 - 00:46:01.066, Speaker B: Somehow it's paid to these people running nodes and validators because you may never have these validators that can be profitable alone from just inflation, for example. I don't know, but that's definitely use case. But you could have obviously like circle, they have a business built on top. You could also have people that are smaller, that are consumer applications and they either have subscription fees or they have advertising and that's how they profit. I'm kind of making this all up, but that's how I actually think something could play out because that's how it's worked in consumer today and consumer applications. Advertising market is absolutely huge, right? And that doesn't exist in crypto today. But anyways, guys, I've got to run, so thank you for putting up with my rant.
00:46:01.066 - 00:46:04.586, Speaker B: This is a lot of fun. Next time I'll come on and be a little bit more participatory and friendly.
00:46:04.698 - 00:46:17.778, Speaker E: No, we love it. I appreciate you battling the crap we were throwing at you. That was fun, man. That was fun. I'll have you back on for sure. But thanks a ton, Garrett. And for the listeners, we'll stick around because we are going through some governance updates next.
00:46:17.944 - 00:46:20.850, Speaker B: Yes, and follow lightspeed links in the show notes.
00:46:22.150 - 00:46:25.026, Speaker E: Got to get the plug in. Yeah, we love it. We'll put that in the show notes for sure. Peace, Gary.

This is not an event you're going to want to miss. Seats are limited, so be sure to register today by hitting the link in the description and using promo code Zero X 20 to save 20% on your tickets. See you in London, the land of tasty pastries. And be sure to hit up Dan.
00:47:19.778 - 00:47:20.758, Speaker D: And I for a beer.
00:47:20.854 - 00:47:45.450, Speaker A: I guess we can just go into the governance update that I briefly mentioned 2 seconds ago about Avalanche, which is ACP 13. Avalanche community Proposal 13. It's kind of a big deal. It's in GitHub. Nothing's implemented yet. It's kind of in a discussion type phase. But the idea of ACP 13 is to remove the need to be a validator on Avalanche primary network in order to validate subnet.
00:47:45.450 - 00:48:15.862, Speaker A: So today, if you want to be a subnet validator, which is Avalanche's version of app chains, you have to also already be a validator on Avalanche primary network or C chain. Today I think November 13, that's about $35,000. It's 2000 Avax. But at the peak of the bull market, that was like 200 grand. So if you wanted to be a validator on a subnet, you needed a $200,000 position in Avax. That drove really, in my opinion, a really good fundamental value proposition to Avax. Basically, you don't actually need fees.
00:48:15.862 - 00:48:49.670, Speaker A: You don't actually need a lot of the things we're talking about with Salana and Ethereum to be sustainable. All you need is an appetite for subnets. ACP 13 removes this need and removes this value proposition in favor of a little bit of an altered one. So basically, now anyone can go be a validator on a subnet. There is no need to be a validator on avalanche if ACP 13 gets implemented. However, depending on the amount of usage that that subnet gets, it'll have to pay an ongoing fee to avalanche, to avalanche validators. So it completely fundamentally changes avalanche its value proposition, and no one is talking about it.
00:48:49.670 - 00:49:28.770, Speaker A: So I think that's pretty cool from my perspective. There's also another one, ACP 13, which is avalanche warp messaging, which would give subnets and avalanche primary network the ability to communicate with each other, just in a very similar way to IBC. Also like sleeper, fact is that AWM and IBC could one day actually be interoperable with each other and communication standards that work together. So there's actually a lot of cool stuff going on in. You know, technically, I'm the expert in avalanche for blockbrooks research and I cover it and I got to say, over the last year, there hasn't been a whole lot for me to really bite into and get interested in, and it seems that's changing. So maybe all l one narrative is back, but I was wondering, what do you guys think about ACP 13?
00:49:29.110 - 00:50:09.786, Speaker E: Yeah, it's definitely really cool because there's a couple of different ways it's interesting, right? So one is from the actual, just purely from the subnet perspective, and like launching your version of an app chain on a subnet. And the other one is Avalanche tokenomics, as you mentioned. So the tokenomics one is interesting, right? Because there's a limited total supply of Avax, which is already pretty interesting for a proof of stake token. Like the matic token did the same thing. Now that they're migrating to their own little. Now they're migrating to Pol to kind of facilitate the staking needs of the future of the polygon world. They removed the hard cap and are introducing long term inflation because you need to kind of do that into perpetuity.
00:50:09.786 - 00:50:53.958, Speaker E: So it's kind of interesting that avalanche is taking a different route there to begin with. But then if we look at fees, all fee revenue on chain goes to the validators. There is a base fee, but that's not like burned as it is in Ethereum, that is also passed back through to the validators. So if you're looking for value accrual to the token, it doesn't really exist in the same sense it does for some of the other blockchains you may know, like Ethereum. And so you already have to start thinking from a different lens when it comes to Avax tokenomics and value accrual. And the difference that they're changing here, it makes sense, right? Let's say I wanted to launch my own app chain. Needing that massive barrier to entry is a deterrent, but at the same time, it's not necessarily cheap to go spin up an app chain in a different landscape.
00:50:53.958 - 00:51:47.360, Speaker E: There's cool things like conduit now that are kind of really simplifying this and these other role as a service providers. But if you're going to go spin up a Cosmos chain, you have to have your own token, take a portion of your supply and kind of like bootstrap, a validator set. We were just talking with Greg Asuri from Akash because Akash went up a Cosmos chain to operate their network, and he was like, yeah, the ongoing inflation cost is a drag and it's something we think very heavily about. And I don't want to put words in his mouth. But he was basically saying, my interpretation of that was if we were going to go do this again, we would actually really consider not building a cosmos chain because we don't necessarily want our own token to have to bootstrap this validator set. So if you look at Subnets today, each subnet with validators has about between two and ten validators today. So they're definitely smaller validator sets by design.
00:51:47.360 - 00:52:30.040, Speaker E: They seem to be playing into this institutional angle and like, hey, we really need these greenlit services where you know, who's interacting with your chain a little more on that Kyc side of things. That's kind of like the direction it appears they've been going in. And it kind of makes a lot of sense to continue building this direction. Right? Like that group cohort of people probably doesn't want to have to take a 2000 token position in Avax. So there's another way for them to do that and pay a little bit more on the variable cost side, right? So it sounds to me like the new model they're using kind of removes the fixed cost and introduces the variable cost. Like, hey, if you're using a ton of our resources, we're going to charge you more kind of thing. So maybe it's a good way to kind of bootstrap some experimentation and it's something that this probably makes a lot of sense for them to focus on right now.
00:52:31.170 - 00:53:18.794, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the variable cost is really interesting thing to think about because if you look at building on top of Ethereum, if you want to go build a roll up on top of Ethereum, you don't need an Ethereum validator. So that's just not a thing. But what you do need is to pay an ongoing fee back to Ethereum dependent on the usage that your rollup is getting. Because if you have a lot of usage, you're going to pay a higher data availability cost back to layer one and settlement costs as well. So it's basically taking that Ethereum scaling model and putting it onto avalanche. And it's something I haven't thought a lot about. But when we were talking about arbitram a second ago and how optimism is kind of eating their lunch a little bit with being able to attract developers, I think it's something that might, even if we see success with avalanche making this transition, that you might even be able to apply to something like arbitram as well, in some shape or form.
00:53:18.992 - 00:53:57.382, Speaker E: One thing I don't know enough about here is the throughput capabilities of a subnet. Because if you were saying, all right, I'm going to go build my own little Kyc chain. I don't know. Say you're Blackrock and you're like, I want to just build a general purpose l one, but you have to verify to get on my chain. Where would you consider building that? Because you could think about an Ethereum based l two that just settles down to l two, has the bridge contract on the L one and settles down to the L one, but uses it's like imagine of a lithium. So it has its own centralized Da layer. Because why would I bother paying to Ethereum if I'm going to be a KYc chain anyways? You're already going to have to trust me and know me.
00:53:57.382 - 00:54:17.790, Speaker E: And it's like, why? I wonder what the trade offs between a validium on top of ethereum versus building a subnet are. That's definitely something I'm not too sure about. Because when you look at these subnets, they do have smaller validator sets. I don't know why that is out of the box. I don't think it's a terrible thing by any means. It's just a different set of trade offs.
00:54:18.370 - 00:54:57.078, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an interesting question. I actually wouldn't imagine that if I'm Blackrock or a cohort of different institutional players looking to create an app chain, I'm making this up. I don't converse with these entities regularly, but I would imagine that they're actually not looking towards roll ups at all. That's probably the last thing. Avalanche is probably the most risky type of chain that they're willing to create. They have the Evergreen framework or the Evergreen subnet, which gives Avalanche subnet creators the ability to actually, in a very modular and easy to set up way, set up these KYC chains. Evergreen is like a framework with different modules that already kind of support what institutional players might need in a chain.
00:54:57.078 - 00:55:37.974, Speaker A: But I think roll up, we're getting more decentralized if we're on a private to public spectrum, right? So you have fully private blockchains that don't interoperate in any way with ethereum or cosmos or anything like that. You have four validators that are all run by centralized entities, and that's kind of the most centralized and the most decentralized being a public blockchain that anyone can permissionlessly validate and permissionlessly use. I don't imagine that those players are really ever going to go kind of further than an avalanche subnet or an avalanche evergreen subnet. But I think if Cosmos offered an easy way to implement a cosmos chain like avalanche does that would fulfill KYC requirements and whatnot. That now cosmos might be a significant competitor in this market as well.
00:55:38.092 - 00:56:01.674, Speaker D: So you guys mentioned arbitrum there. We actually got three governance updates from the arbitrum side of the world that tie in nicely together. Backfunding, successful steps that didn't make the like. I guess they did get voted yes and they reached quorum, but they weren't in the top 50 projects. So they're looking for an additional 21.4 million arb to give to 26 more projects. I believe it was 56 that didn't get an allo.
00:56:01.674 - 00:56:17.230, Speaker D: So this would cover about half of them. That one is voting live right now and should end on Tuesday the 14th. We are recording this on Monday the 13th. So by the time this goes live, the result will be solidified. But what do you guys think here? Should we be funding this or not?
00:56:17.400 - 00:56:53.866, Speaker A: Man, I have such mixed feelings on this one. My initial thought is that probably not, and I have a bunch of reasons for this. A. The original governance proposal stated that 50 million ARB was going to be the amount that we were going to allocate to incentives by January 31 for this short term incentive program. First of all, if we give 25 million more or whatever a little less, that kind of goes back on our ward. When do we stop? Like, okay, fine, what about those that didn't have a chance to get into the round one? Are we going to keep giving out more r before January 31, or should we kind of stick to our guns? And it's not that long. It's November 13.
00:56:53.866 - 00:57:57.802, Speaker A: We're talking about like two and a half months. So I think it might make more sense to wait and to do another incentive round after January 31. Additionally, if we waited until then, we'd be able to do an analysis or multiple analysis on how well these incentive programs worked, and then we'd be able to potentially utilize our better than kind of just giving it out to these programs now, for instance, maybe we learn that gas rebates have a higher retention of users than giving it to lending LPs or something, and that'll be very important and valuable data to have. And then finally, the entities that would get funded in this round aren't reflective of how voters would have voted had 75 million are been allocated. It kind of became this strategic game towards the end of you voted to get the protocols you wanted into the amount so that where they'd get allocated to if there was 50 million getting given out. For instance, blockworks research, we only supported 50 million urban requests, so we only voted yes on those that requested 50. And had there been 75 to allocate, we would have voted very differently.
00:57:57.802 - 00:58:33.050, Speaker A: And this is true, I'm positive, of all delegates. So clearly there's a ton of problems with doing it this way. But one thing to note is if we ran a short term incentive program route two right now, likely it would be pretty random results as well. I don't think that these protocols have worse incentive programs than the ones that did get funded or the ones that would get funded in a subsequent round. So it's kind of just random anyways, who got funds and who didn't. I'm not random, but maybe not based fully on qualitative analysis of which ones were the best programs. So it's not like these ones are maybe worse than the ones that did get funded.
00:58:33.050 - 00:58:48.360, Speaker A: So it's really all about like, okay, do we think that we should up it to 75 million because there was so much appetite, because so many protocols wanted incentives, which I actually think is valid. I think some delegates probably wanted 75 million to start and that doesn't change now. So it's a tough one.
00:58:49.050 - 00:59:27.358, Speaker E: That's really interesting. Matt, you've been very boots on the ground with this whole process here. And I think maybe the reason that it was a bit challenging has to a lot to do with just like the format that that was in. Right. I was listening to an arbitram space today on the Twitter space that was exactly about this topic. And just hearing other people express the same issues that you had when you're going through all these steps was you had to give like 1520 minutes to each step and there was 100 plus steps. And so it's like maybe the system was a little bit broken and so is it like multiple compounding issues here? And so now when you're trying to think about how do you backfund these things? I don't know.
00:59:27.358 - 01:00:00.620, Speaker E: I definitely don't have a good answer here on yes or no. As it pertains, at the end of the day, it's 20 million tokens. In the grand scheme of things, that's a relatively small number. But one thing that is worth noting is since the start of the year, since the token generation event, between the Dow treasury and the foundation activity, there's been about an 11% increase in circulating supply. And that's over the course of about eight or so months since token generation event. That's like one thing that the community should probably keep in mind is when you're emitting tokens from a Dow treasury, that is new supply hitting the market. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.
01:00:00.620 - 01:00:28.190, Speaker E: Getting the treasury in the hands of the community is largely a good thing. Especially these are pretty builder focused incentives. And I tend to think that's probably a better way to go about this than just like per se, maybe like an airdrop round two or something like that. So that's what I would say is just keep in the back of your head you are emitting new tokens. And so you really have to weigh out the value of doing this. And I tend to think like getting them in the hands of the builders is like I said, is probably a good strategy.
01:00:28.350 - 01:01:15.970, Speaker A: There's a bit of a crazy conversation going on. There was a grant funded by one of Arbitram's grants program's plurality labs to do a budget. Basically create a budget for how much Arp can we spend without having big price impact on the token? And I forget the exact number, but the initial report from this, what seemed to me like a very rudimentary analysis, was that basically you could emit another 100 something million by the end of the year and not have it impact the pricing. And this was purely based on order book depth, which I don't think takes into account other things that could have impact on flows and sediment among the market of just the idea of having more tokens emitted. But yeah, it is interesting that they did. There is this grant outstanding to create budget, and that the budget is basically saying that we can emit tons more tokens and it won't be a problem.
01:01:16.120 - 01:01:37.850, Speaker E: That basically be like doubling or so the amount of total supply that's hit the market since token generation. And I don't necessarily think that makes a ton of sense. And that's like 20% inflation in a year. And again, this isn't like a token trying to make money. So inflation is probably not even the best word there. It's just like supply growth. But when you are emitting new tokens, you do need net new buyers.
01:01:37.850 - 01:01:57.022, Speaker E: That's just something to consider. And I haven't seen this analysis. I don't really know what their framework was or process was there. But again, that'd be going from about eleven or so percent inflation to something closer to 20. I don't know. I wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable just throwing another 100 million tokens out the window.
01:01:57.166 - 01:02:24.780, Speaker D: Yeah, I would agree with everything you guys just said and just echo the same points onto the other one, which kind of is tied into it. One inch is voting to sell the original Arb airdrop that they got for USDC and then bridge it back to Ethereum. The vote closes on the 18th and the yes is winning big time right now. And quorum is practically reached. Not a ton to say on this one. Other than the fact that I do believe most of these tokens ultimately get sold. Don't get benefits to the actual l two.
01:02:24.780 - 01:02:32.058, Speaker D: Come on, they're bridging back to Ethereum. It just seems pretty ridiculous to me. I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on it.
01:02:32.224 - 01:03:17.100, Speaker E: This is exactly kind of what my point was earlier when I said you have to just think about the impact that you're creating when you're issuing new tokens and generally giving them in the hands of the builder seems to be a better way than just like maybe an airdrop, but not if they just turn around and sell them. So I think they said this can be a manual sell. So I don't know if they'll do some OTC transactions, try to minimize their price impact. And again, they are a Dex aggregator, so maybe they have their own user on routing technology, but you just got to measure the value of what you're getting in return. Not to go back to the stips one, but I think it makes sense to. I don't necessarily think there's a rush here. I would have to really hear out the argument for why there would need to be a rush to kind of do this in mass really quickly.
01:03:17.100 - 01:03:57.922, Speaker E: But I don't necessarily think there's a rush here. So I'd rather do some analysis around the quality of the impact of this tip. So for example, GMX fees were off the charts for the initial first couple of days when the incentives went live. Let's look at those token holders. What are they doing with the ARB incentives that they're getting after they trade with these things? Are they just turning around and market dumping them? Because if so, what is that ultimately doing for arbitrage? I'm like, it's progressive decentralization for sure, but with new issuance and if it just turns around and hits the open market and hits the order books, it's like, what was the net benefit there? I don't know. I think you need to focus on community building and driving. Long term staying power, really more so than just some of these short term plays.
01:03:58.066 - 01:04:27.666, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the keywords here are opportunistic capital, like money that's just going to come farm and then leave, versus getting sticky liquidity and sticky brain power. I think we actually say it in our arbitram delegate platform. But there are times when incentive programs and liquidity farming can be worthwhile endeavors. But generally speaking, most of the time, at least from my perspective, there are negative EV endeavors. You're spending more value than you're actually getting. So I strong agree. Not a huge fan of incentives in general, unless they're really well thought out.
01:04:27.666 - 01:05:01.270, Speaker A: That said, arbitram is kind of, in my opinion, best tech stack of any L two today, highest TVL. It's well positioned, but they're having a tough time attracting developers. And I think a lot of very astute people kind of see that arbitrage struggling in some regards. And because of this, it makes sense for the dow to be taking big swings and swing for the fences and really do things that are high risk, high potential reward. Incentive programs aren't necessarily what I would look towards for that. But I do think it's important to the Dow really try to do things that set it apart from other roll ups today before it's too late.
01:05:01.350 - 01:05:43.894, Speaker E: Yeah, I totally agree with you there, Matt. The only other thing I'd add is I think there is also real value in building goodwill with some of the builders. Right. So going back to the GMX example, they played a very pivotal role in the early days of arbitrum. And so now that they got a large dip and they're seeing very increased fees because of the increased activity around the ARB incentives that they've got and that they're utilizing, and it's like if you create a comfortable and exciting place for builders to go, then you are going to attract those new wave of builders. And that is definitely going to be a competition between the l two s of who gets the best builders to create the best apps to then attract in the next wave of users. So it does make sense why these incentive programs exist.
01:05:43.894 - 01:05:48.330, Speaker E: It's just doing so. Increasing the efficiency of them, I think, is ultimately the goal here.
01:05:48.480 - 01:06:18.214, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's going to be like a long road until we actually know the optimal way to design a token, use it to incentivize users and stuff. But that's kind of what makes this space so fun right now, is we're all just kind of figuring it out as we go. All right, my Internet is pretty shitty and we're running up on an hour and ten minutes. So I'm going to speed race through these last three governance updates, all related to inflation in some way. So that's kind of the theme of today. But Adam is looking to cut the max staking yield from 20% down to 10%. And then we also have shout out westy for pointing this one out.
01:06:18.214 - 01:06:52.914, Speaker D: He saw a conversation in the discord which is also available on govhub on blockworksresearch.com. Little self plug, but basically proposal to remove SNX inflation entirely. With the current inflation rate at 5% annualized, this mixed with base V three synthetics deployment could be a pretty large catalyst. And then on top of that you've got 30 million op up for grabs with retro PGF around three. And obviously synthetics is likely to get an allocation. And then we also have reduced inflation in some way, not really reduced, but more relocated for DyDX. Their beta just went live.
01:06:52.914 - 01:07:16.934, Speaker D: So you can actually trade on DyDX chain, which is super exciting, Matt, I know you're going to love that. And then they're also migrating incentives from DyDX V three on Starkx over to DyDx chain by winding down those incentives from epochs 30 to 32 and then of course reallocating them to DyDx chain in hopes of migrating user activity over there.
01:07:17.052 - 01:07:44.430, Speaker A: Dy DX is the one that stands out to me. I am keeping a very close eye. I think the first trade occurred this morning, so fees should know. Technically speaking, going back to validators and dydx token stakers today, there is a chance that there is Zoomy APR on staking DyDX for the first couple of days, first couple of weeks, first couple of months. Even. So, it's something that I am keeping a close eye. It sucks because I told myself I was going to buy a large spot bag of it, kind of to hold forever.
01:07:44.430 - 01:08:10.200, Speaker A: There's very few coins that I count on one hand how many coins that I'd actually want long term exposure to, and the UIDX is actually one of them. And I'm kind of hidden myself as it goes through $3 and I was telling myself that under $2, but you can't win them all. I would keep a close eye on the trading volume. There's a ton of incentives going to traders, there's a ton of new pairs that could get volume and not a lot of DydX staked thus far.
01:08:10.730 - 01:08:35.374, Speaker E: Only thing I have to add there is Sam, you just mentioned three protocols that are thinking deeply about inflation, so maybe it is a cost after all. But I'll leave you with that. Thanks again for this excellent episode, guys. Be sure to give Garrett a follow on Twitter. We'll put his Twitter in the show notes. Follow lightspeed. It's an incredible podcast again, has a little bit of a slanaline, so it's really exciting to kind of get a little bit deeper into the things going on in that ecosystem as well.
01:08:35.374 - 01:08:37.758, Speaker E: Thanks again guys, and we will see you next week.
01:08:37.844 - 01:08:56.370, Speaker C: Hey everyone, thanks so much for tuning into today's episode. We hope you really enjoyed it.
