00:00:00.360 - 00:00:21.905, Speaker A: I think very fucking cooked. Excuse me. I think that the down. I mean, I just think of like putting. Putting on my macro hat, which I like, try not to wear, but I just think of like the up and up down beta capture of these things and like they have a lot of down beta and they like don't have as much up beta as they used to have. So, like, you end up. The ratio just does.
00:00:21.905 - 00:00:35.785, Speaker A: It hasn't been working for a long time, I feel for like more than six months. So I feel like it's. Unless you get the clear, like the all clear from a Trump win, I feel like it's really, really hard to justify going out on the risk spectrum.

Today I'm joined by Danny, Ryan, Connor and Felix Javon or Javan.
00:01:04.549 - 00:01:09.385, Speaker C: Javan or Jovane, if you're French and you can, you can pull it off.
00:01:09.685 - 00:01:14.425, Speaker B: I cannot. From forward guidance. Previously on the margin.
00:01:15.045 - 00:01:15.825, Speaker C: Yes.
00:01:16.685 - 00:01:23.905, Speaker B: Also known as macro gcr, also known as saves our asses on analyst calls by coming in and talking about macro. How you doing, Felix?
00:01:24.365 - 00:01:35.785, Speaker C: Good, good. Oh, I'm so excited to be here. Big fan of. Of going into the other side of the barrel barbell a little bit away from macro and just diving into the trenches a little bit today. So it's gonna be fun.
00:01:36.205 - 00:02:08.065, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll do. I think we'll spend most of the time talking about things that is more in your realm than our. Fair enough. Election week, weekend, week. But I wanna, I wanna ask one question at the very, very beginning is how much does Felix know or how much do you do in crypto? Because I feel like, like, my understanding was that you weren't very crypto heavy, but then I listened to a bunch of Forward guidance episodes, OTMs, and you're quite comfortable. So do you want to give a background on.
00:02:08.805 - 00:02:15.029, Speaker C: Sure, yeah. I. Yeah, I'm pretty. I'm pretty in the trenches. I. I will say, at least in my opinion. I don't know.
00:02:15.029 - 00:03:00.587, Speaker C: I. I got into crypto through a macro lens, like in 2019 or so. Firstly for mostly bitcoin. You know, like, I read the bitcoin standard book and was looking at it through that lens of like, okay, you know, the inception of Bitcoin is a life raft against currency debasement, against government intervention, et cetera, et cetera. Was, you know, pretty solidly of the mind that, you know, money and just like global discount rates are broken, which means like valuations are broken because the money is broken. So I got in originally through that and then as I got into it I started to explore, you know, start to go down the rabbit hole of everything else. And I've always, yeah, had like a bit of a degen flair to myself.
00:03:00.587 - 00:03:37.771, Speaker C: So definitely appreciated all of that. So yeah, you know, like I pretty much rode the wave. Like I really got on chain around the time of Defi summer was playing around with that. Um, I was all over the place, rotating the different, you know, Olympus ohm ohm forks and the like on every different chain. So that got me pretty experienced with jumping across random esoteric chains. I was super deep at the time in, in the NFT world actually like 2020, 2021. I was just like constantly in every discord of any new like OpenSea project launch at the time.
00:03:37.771 - 00:04:09.633, Speaker C: You know, this was before we got like a million projects that were launched every day. There was this like one or two a week. So I was pretty deep and focused on that. And actually it's funny I always talk about all these macro thoughts and things, but for sure the best I've ever done trading was an NFT and flipping them. So that was a lot of that context. So doing that at the same time as messing around with Defi Defi summer and DeFi 2.0 when we decided to call it that for a little bit before it all unwound, you know.
00:04:09.633 - 00:04:41.351, Speaker C: So I've always, I've always been in there, you know, not. I wouldn't say I have any like fundamental edge in it, but I was always, you know, setting aside, you know, some, some money to go speculate on chain jumping around, you know, like I was, I played the Defi Kingdoms thing when that was running, you know, I think I bought juul at like 2 bucks. So I did pretty good there. I didn't sell the pico top, but like I was, I was, I was running those flywheels. So I don't know, I've kind of been everywhere but you know, probably just as more of a tourist than anything. I wouldn't say I would necessarily have like a good edge in it, but I have a lot of fun in it.
00:04:41.503 - 00:04:55.475, Speaker B: I think that's the perfect way to approach. You probably just don't fully do it the Full time, but when the money's rolling, just come in and then go out as well. I have a. Were you a gold bug at any point? Because I feel like.
00:04:56.615 - 00:05:26.051, Speaker C: Yeah, a little bit. I feel like around that time where I was just like, yeah, so, I mean, originally, before I was like full on macro. Like, I was originally like a value investor and like reading the Buffett books and stuff. Um, and so I feel like there's that transition phase where I was, you know, I was definitely like, reading the Peter Schiff stuff and being like, oh, my God, like, global central banks are corrupted and broken. We need to own gold. And so I, I still have an appreciation for gold, but I wouldn't say I'm a gold bug. Like, I view it as more of like a trade than like a, oh my God, everybody needs to own gold forever and like, hide it under your.
00:05:26.051 - 00:05:41.045, Speaker C: Your. Your bed type of idea. But, you know, I, like, I still own some gold, but definitely view it like, it's just like more of like a correlation thing then, like, I still think fundamentally, like, bitcoin is better than gold in terms of its properties.
00:05:41.345 - 00:05:50.405, Speaker B: That's what I think as well. All right, let's get into, I guess, some election stuff. Danny, do you want to queue us up?
00:05:51.865 - 00:06:24.085, Speaker D: Yeah, clearly, I think everyone is aware we've had this impending event for the past several months. Lots of discussion about it for all over the feed. It's. It's been a main topic for quite a while in, in our industry at least maybe some, Some quick takeaways from just some of the data that we're seeing. Like polls have. I. I don't know if it's just market positioning, like people getting crazy about some of these early polls coming in and maybe showing some slight, unexpected, unexpected results in different states.
00:06:24.085 - 00:06:55.295, Speaker D: Like Iowa had a. Had a poll indicating a Kamala win, though only one of. Of several polls that came out recently. So hard to say how much weight should be put in there, but we're seeing maybe market moves happening on some of these things in real time. Some other interesting data that I think maybe is. Shouldn't be too surprising is that in some states some of the early results are showing lots of like, female Democrats as new as a majority of new early voters, which when you have a woman up for presidential candidate, maybe that shouldn't be so surprising. Right.
00:06:55.295 - 00:07:32.475, Speaker D: But I, I guess there's a lot of things to cover here, Felix. I'm sure you guys have been discussing over on forward guidance potential impacts on macro and related. But. And I think maybe the Topic around repositioning and, you know, a Trump, Trump victory in the Trump trade and then maybe some, some recent hedging and other things or thoughts on that going on have probably been discussed ad nauseam. But the other thing we can talk about generally is maybe general expectations. I think there's some, if we look across the board, like 538 Poly Market, Kalshi, even Robin Hood now has, you know, trading for it. There's lots of polls out now.
00:07:32.475 - 00:07:51.323, Speaker D: The general expectations seem maybe fairly mixed, although a lot of the betting markets seem to still kind of be in favor of a Trump win just by a small margin today. Curious everyone's thoughts. Do we have any super hot takes here or is it really like a toss up? Like it, like it kind of seems to be.
00:07:51.459 - 00:08:12.171, Speaker B: I'm gonna say, well, I first want to also do like a little roundup of everybody gives who they think is gonna win and then I get to bully if you're wrong or if you're right. But I think it's going to be very close. I think it's gonna be Trump who wins. But I think it's gonna be a lot closer than the echo chamber that my Twitter algorithm thinks it is. I think it's going to be kind of a toss up. What do you guys think?
00:08:12.363 - 00:08:52.743, Speaker C: I might take a little bit of a cop out and say that I think it's going to be a clear winner, but I'm almost in a weird way still like 50, 50 on who the clear winner will be. But I feel like it's going to be a clear winner. I feel like. So obviously there's that Iowa poll that kind of shook markets over the weekend because it came out like, pretty dominant towards Kamala and the, the pollster has a pretty good track record. And I think that that was a really good thing to happen. I think because I was getting pretty concerned about positioning going into this, that we were pretty aggressively pricing in a Trump win. And I just don't think it's as clear as it should have been based on what was priced into the markets.
00:08:52.743 - 00:09:28.125, Speaker C: And just in general, you know, if you're going into like a, like a 5050 event, like, obviously one of them is going to win, one of them is going to lose. And, and to go into there with that much of, of an expectation of one of them to actually win is, is pretty concerning to me. So I'm really glad to see it come back down where, you know, intuitively it feels to me like we're, we're at 50, 50 pricing again. You know, if you just look at, like, where Bitcoin was trading before that run up versus now. So I don't know, I feel like, just intuitively it feels like it's going to be a clear winner. But, you know, if, if just to, you know, put it out there, I'm gonna. I guess I'll plant my flag on Trump.
00:09:28.125 - 00:09:49.587, Speaker C: But I can also see the case for Kamala. But I do think whoever wins, it'll be. It'll be a clear winner. So that's kind of why, like, you know, I tweeted out last week that, like, my base case is the nothing ever happens meme, because I just feel like there's going to be a pretty sound resolution, but I could be wrong. You know, I'm just. I'm just do my best guess on political analysis. So I don't know.
00:09:49.771 - 00:10:26.255, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel, I feel that I am working with a decent mental model for this one. I think that Trump takes this pretty easily. I think perhaps over 300 electoral college votes, which is similar to the outcome that you saw in 2016. The reason I feel that way is because I'm looking at, like, all these polls that are coming in. If they favor the Democrats from an elect, from an electoral college perspective, they do so by a very narrow margin. And the opposite's true if they end up favoring the Republicans. And just from like, account perspective, I'm seeing far more Republican wins than Democrat.
00:10:26.255 - 00:10:55.475, Speaker A: The other. Like, I think you have to also have to implement, like, a fudge factor, right? Like the popular vote. Like the popular vote polling. Like, they underestimated Trump by nine points in 2016. They underestimated him by four points in 2020. Maybe they underestimate him by, like, two points because you do objectively have, like, this, like, like, white male voters who support Trump, refuse to answer the polls correctly or participate. And we're seeing that at a New York Times.
00:10:55.475 - 00:11:27.191, Speaker A: I think they just had a recent article about that. So I think there's still. There's still a little social stigma there that's like, systematically undercounting his support. So when I take, when I take all that and I just look at the polls and then you apply that fudge factor. I think, like, you have pretty handily, like, Trump having, like, a pretty easy night. Now, the Iowa poll kind of like, throws a wrench into that. But from just, like, poking around, it seems like the sample size was very low.
00:11:27.191 - 00:12:20.117, Speaker A: Like, in a very odd fashion. Like, the demographics of the poll were not disclosed, and it was what was Max Resnick's tweet about it. It was like a frequentness poll as opposed to taking in prior pro or past probabilities. So you're supposed to like take into consideration like the past polls and like your projections. And this was just like a standalone thing which you know, has obvious like sample size biases. So yeah, I think, I think it's pretty obvious. It's like, what's going to happen now? Like, I think the big question is the price action over the next 12 months in both scenarios and pretty firmly believe that over a 12 month period if, if Trump wins, you see Bitcoin at 150 and I actually think that you are down to flat on bitcoin.
00:12:20.117 - 00:12:23.585, Speaker A: If Pamela wins, I don't think it's very obvious that bitcoin goes higher.
00:12:24.185 - 00:12:43.097, Speaker B: I think V shaped recovery after. Come on. If Kamala wins, I don't think. I think bitcoin is destined to go to150,000 per. I think it's the golden bull run and I think it doesn't matter. I don't know about alts especially. I think D5 just keeps getting cooked, but I think bitcoin is.
00:12:43.281 - 00:13:04.485, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like my framework too, I agree, is that, yeah, we got this. We get the short term deviation if, if she wins. But I think like, I can get into it a little bit, but I still think like the macro is just like so fundamentally bullish that I just don't know how you derail that necessarily. But yeah, there's just the idiosyncratic factors of how it gets applied to like the regulatory situation.
00:13:05.145 - 00:13:47.455, Speaker D: I'll add a take here before we fully jump into the price. Price predictions, expectations and hopes. I do think in line with, I think both of what Felix and Ryan have said, although Felix, you kind of sat on the fence a little bit with the prediction. But I do think the point about having a clear winner is probably going to ring true. I just did some like, historical looking at some of these like key kind of battleground states over the past several elections and there just tends to be this trend of like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, them sort of all kind of falling in line to whoever the winner is. You know, historically I think Ohio as well used to be one of those states, but has become a bit more of a red state since Trump. So that's kind of changed that thing up.
00:13:47.455 - 00:14:28.245, Speaker D: But if you look at some of the early, early polling data in those states, those numbers are dominated by Democrat voters, registered voters as of right now, which just gives me the feeling that there's some underrepresentation towards Trump at the moment, which has me leaning in his favor in like taking all three of those states. And then really just, I think when you look at just the rest of the makeup, with it being sort of largely decided in most cases, I think that kind of maybe defines the outcome there for us. And that might be that margin that we're talking about where you get those three, four states fall in line and he gets that handy victory of, you know, 40, 50 electoral votes. However you see that playing out.
00:14:28.785 - 00:14:32.805, Speaker B: Ryan Connor, why do you think we're going down? Why do you hate Bitcoin?
00:14:34.105 - 00:15:32.475, Speaker A: If you look at the regime that the Democrats have, like, look, I've, I've been following politics for some time. I've always really enjoyed it. I've watched the Democrat and Republican Party change very meaningfully over my lifetime. As far as the Democrats or, sorry, the demographics that they support, the policies that they support. And one, if you're going to point out like, what's the biggest trend in the Democrat Party, it's, it's just this, it's, it's this aggressive stance toward business and wealth and capital formation. If you look at the IPO market since the Democrats have been in power, it's been nothing like VCs cannot exit. If you look at the rhetoric towards, you know, wealthy individuals in the United States, it's increasingly like reached new highs, it seems like every four years.
00:15:32.475 - 00:15:46.765, Speaker A: So much, so much so to the point where they're not even willing to acknowledge an individual like Elon Musk, who's done so much like, for the country, for the world, for the environment. And they can't even, they can't even acknowledge his existence.
00:15:47.145 - 00:15:47.689, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:47.777 - 00:16:15.697, Speaker A: If you're looking back at the EV summit or if you're looking today where they'll actually denounce what he's done, net. Right. They'll say that he is, that he is a net negative. And that's baffling to me. So if you have like this very anti, like capital formation stance, then that's bad for risk markets. And Bitcoin today is still a risk asset. Objectively.
00:16:15.697 - 00:17:01.211, Speaker A: There is no quantitative measure that I can see where Bitcoin is a, like, safe haven asset. It might theoretically be that because of the 21 million thing and because of the censorship, resistance or whatever, but objectively today it's quantitatively you cannot make that case. So that's why I think Bitcoin sideways to down, because, you know, in these, let's say that you have to De risk, like you do risk the riskiest thing in your portfolio. And like, I'm sure the NASDAQ does well like those things. They have political influence, like they have moats. There's, you know, you're, you're kind of stuck with mega cap tech. But like the Democrats have done what they could to hurt crypto as much as they could over the past four years.
00:17:01.211 - 00:17:16.295, Speaker A: Operation Choke Point and you know, numerous SEC actions like, why wouldn't that trend continue? And I look at her platform and they're still not playing nice with crypto. And the other.
00:17:18.235 - 00:18:06.909, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like all you need to do to prove that out is just look at the change in Silicon Valley execs from being like pretty hard Democrats to all pivoting to Republicans. Like, there's just been a huge pivot to that. And I always listen to Scott Galloway who runs like a, he's doing like a raging moderates podcast, which is like fairly left leaning and just like, as a, you know, just get the other side because I feel like I just live in quite like a center right echo chamber on Twitter. So I always like to listen to it just to see like what they're thinking about. And even they had admitted like not inviting Elon to that EV summit was just an absolute fuck up. Like, how could you not invite the guy who just spearheaded the entire thing just to like, of course he's going to go over to Trump and, and try to, you know, get something going there because you guys pushed him out. Like, it's ridiculous to not invite him to like an EV summit when he's, he's the EV guy.
00:18:06.957 - 00:18:47.787, Speaker D: You know, I will, I will push back a little bit. Ryan, I guess I'm curious to understand, like we're in a Democratic regime today and have been since, you know, 2020, and yet over the past few years, bitcoin is up significantly from its, you know, prior case of the lows falling out of the kind of the 2021 crazy market cycle post Covid, despite the SEC actions against, you know, altcoin projects and daos and labs teams. Like, I mean, bitcoin has done incredibly well in this climate. So why, why would continuing the administration another four years be a death, like a sideways moment for it?
00:18:47.851 - 00:19:20.675, Speaker A: I guess bitcoin's done well because the SEC has lost. Like, they've done a very good job at losing. So if you get, if you're, if you're able to push these things high enough where you get to Republican courts, pro business courts, then they start to lose. But that takes some time. I think you have, to a degree, you have a market that's pricing in a more favorable regulatory regime. And obviously, I think that that has to unwind if. If the election goes towards Harris and especially if they win, like, meaningful seats in the House and Senate.
00:19:20.675 - 00:20:00.383, Speaker A: I think that. I mean, look, following Anchorage from, like, early days, they got their OCC charter, which was like, a huge reason why Crypto ran in 2020. It was like, you know, old bank regulators saying, like, hey, you can custody Bitcoin at, like, a tradfi custodian. Anchorage got that license. They got it in late 2020. They were like, you know, they were on the process towards implementing that licensure. And then Biden got elected and they had to push it through before he reached office because they feared that he would revoke it.
00:20:00.383 - 00:20:28.277, Speaker A: They feared that he would revoke it. Like, those things are not good for business planning. Right. And any progress that you're making, like, if you have Gary Gensler is going to hit you with a second third lawsuit. Like, I just think that that's an overhang. Combined with the observation that I do think we are objectively, like, late cycle, given what's going on with you through unemployment. So I just think that the risks are more to the downside, I guess.
00:20:28.381 - 00:20:52.123, Speaker D: Felix, I'd want to hear your thoughts on this. Like, 12 months out, maybe even longer. But, like, to Ryan's point, like, what are your thoughts given. Given macro, given your view of the world going forward? Like, to me, going into what is. Seems to be an easing cycle, it just feels like risk should continue to thrive. And if bitcoin is one of the riskiest assets, why wouldn't you be buying in Handover fist?
00:20:52.299 - 00:21:22.781, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like, okay, so the simple framework that I have is we got a growth slowdown over the summer that caused some spikes in the labor market, which Ryan was referring to. Um, and at that time, we saw a little bit of other, you know, economic indicators start to point towards some acceleration of the downside. And it feels like, you know, early August, that's when we saw, like, the. The yen carry, trade unwind stuff. There's a lot of things kind of coming ahead all at the same time. And we got to this point where, you know, there was.
00:21:22.781 - 00:21:44.031, Speaker C: There was talk of like, yeah, like 75 bips, like intermedia cuts being talked about. And. And things got a little bit ridiculous there for a minute. But what that did do is the Fed came in in September and cut 50 bips for their first move. And I think part of that was an admission that they should have cut in July. So they tried to catch up. But okay, so they're cutting rates.
00:21:44.031 - 00:22:31.227, Speaker C: We're at the top of the easing of the hiking cycle. We're beginning the easing cycle now. You need to think about the context of how are we cutting, like what are we cutting these rates into? Like what type of economic context are we in. In my opinion the distinction is whether you think we're going to continue into a recession or is this the bottom of the slowdown and we start to, you know, either trend up or actually re accelerate up. I think there's some, there's some orange to red flags in the labor market that signify that it was warranted going 50bps and that they should continue to cut. I think, you know, it's highly priced in that they will cut this week 25 bips. I'm pretty confident they'll cut again at least 25 bips in December because there is some structural changes in the labor market.
00:22:31.227 - 00:23:13.737, Speaker C: There's a lot of noise in labor market right now. I don't want to get into like the specific idiosyncrasies of it, but overall just know there's a lot of noise but when you unpack the noise a little bit, there is some somewhat concerning trends that will keep the Fed on the gas of cutting rate. So now you just need to think about okay, how, how much weaker will the labor market get? I don't know, maybe marginally weaker. But I, I don't like we've seen, you know, the SOM rule was something that got talked about a lot throughout the summer. That it just shows attracts the, the momentum and acceleration and convexity of the unemployment rate because when it kind of goes, it really goes. And that actually triggered and then reversed and, and like untriggered this month. And that's something that almost like never happened.
00:23:13.737 - 00:23:54.431, Speaker C: So it just goes to show that there's a lot of noise but overall there is some, there is some weakness and sluggishness in the labor market paired with what feels like pretty solid growth. You know we got the GDP print that came out last week and it's sitting around 3% and it's continuing to trend that way the next quarter. Like Atlanta Fed GDP now cast which is forecasting this coming quarter is a bit weaker, you know, like 2.3% but still solid, you know, for getting real GDP above 2%. Like I don't know, that's pretty, that's pretty damn good. Especially within the context of Okay, a sluggish labor market. So we're not going to see like the wage price spiral accelerate, accelerate that much at the same time that we're seeing on the inflation side of things.
00:23:54.431 - 00:24:18.775, Speaker C: Like there's some stickiness there involved, namely like shelter. Inflation is the big sticky one. But okay, what does the Fed actually target? They target personal consumption expenditure, like PCE, not CPI, and they want that at 2%. If you look at like the year of, or year over year print of that on a headline basis, we're at 2.1% as of a week ago. So 10 basis points above target. Like, it's pretty good.
00:24:18.775 - 00:25:11.741, Speaker C: There's this like to, I'll admit, like, if you look at core pce, it's significantly above that because of that stickiness and shelter. But overall, like the big concerns about inflation are cut off. You know, if you want to track this in real time, my simple framework right now is just looking at oil prices and you know, we're sub 70 and chopping around there. That's, that's pretty low on a cyclical basis. Like, I'm not getting worried about inflation until we get at least $100 barrel of oil. So as long as that stays and we see the Fed really, you know, trying to get underneath this, this stagnating labor market, to me, that paints a picture of Goldilocks, which is really positive for, for risk assets as long as it doesn't get meaningfully worse to the downside or inflation really accelerates higher. So putting that all together, the simple way you can think about this is, okay, if you're worried about inflation, go look at oil.
00:25:11.741 - 00:25:25.829, Speaker C: And if it's. As long as it's below a hundred bucks, we're probably okay. If it's above a hundred bucks, you can start worrying. On the other side, you can continue to look at the labor market. Like the U3 unemployment rate that Ryan talked about. That's one of the cleaner metrics. Like the monthly jobs numbers get revisioned.
00:25:25.829 - 00:25:44.855, Speaker C: Like they're just very noisy because of how they're basically calculated. So keep an eye on unemployment rate. But it's, it's kind of chopping around here. So within that context, like it's, it's hard not for me to be bullish on, on risk at this juncture, but you got to be, you got to still be wary of those two potential tail risks and, and them accelerating.
00:25:45.555 - 00:26:29.865, Speaker A: Yeah, I would still be bullish risk assets here over really any time frame. Like, I think AI is very, very transformative. But you have to think about the idiosyncratic risk that crypto faces. And it's not, it's, you know, you're going to this place where the industry is waiting for this moment where the guy who's selling NFTs and who promises to make the United States the capital for bitcoin mining is thought to be president and then that not happening and all the people that have been suing you for the last four years get to keep on suing you. Like it's going to be quite a reversal and like, I don't know, timeframes, like maybe the pain lasts for a week, three months, 12 months, I don't know. But like you've had a nice run. Bitcoin's up big.
00:26:29.865 - 00:26:35.137, Speaker A: It wouldn't be surprised if you, it wouldn't surprise me if you got a nice pullback and then you went sideways for a while.
00:26:35.321 - 00:26:48.831, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree for sure. Like it's again, that whole framework is super obvious for like equities and stuff and I'm like super long those. But crypto is a bit more complicated because of this idiosyncratic baking in of expectations that Ryan's talking about.
00:26:48.953 - 00:27:01.131, Speaker B: Hey guys. For today's snippet, Miguel is going to take on the age old question of why does decentralization matter, specifically in terms of AI for this one. Thanks you for, thank you for joining us, Miguel.
00:27:01.283 - 00:27:04.415, Speaker E: Thank you Vocacho for inviting me. It's great to be here.
00:27:06.675 - 00:27:09.815, Speaker B: So why is decentralized AI important?
00:27:10.835 - 00:27:37.915, Speaker E: Well, AI is not just any other tech, right. It has the potential to become a very powerful way to control people, to serve people. Yes. And it's going to be really helpful and useful, but also to control people. And right now we have this oligopoly, a monopoly of a few that is not, is not very comforting. Right. To put such amount of power in the hands of a few companies.
00:27:37.915 - 00:28:41.055, Speaker E: So it is of strategic importance to change that, to open up the market, to foster innovation. Because the moment you bring in more companies into the mix, then you're going to have more innovation, not just continuous innovation, but also you're going to get disruptive innovation. And most importantly, you have to minimize trust in those centralized AI providers. So that's the reason why decentralized AI is such an important and exciting idea because it's all about minimizing that trust. It's all about removing that power away from those few companies looking forward so that we can hope for a future where AI can be run in a safe way on safe infrastructure that is essentially decentralized. That no one controls and therefore it's more fair to people and doesn't take advantage of them.
00:28:42.195 - 00:28:47.415, Speaker B: And how do you see decentralized AI competing with centralized AI?
00:28:48.115 - 00:30:05.143, Speaker E: That's a tough question because invariably decentralized AI is going to be slower in terms of performance. So the value has to be somewhere else, has to be in some different aspect of a value proposition. And I think what I was saying before is interesting enough to be useful. For example, companies right now have a problem already with privacy and LLMs, because I mean, if I'm a different company, not an AI company, and I'm sitting all this wealth of private information that is actually probably one of my assets in the company, I don't want to be sharing that information with the company running the AI. So privacy, it is an important problem that companies face now. And decentralized AI, when we understand also with decentralization, the privacy component solves for that problem. Decentralization, as in a network running things, can be also interesting for companies when they want to collaborate, so they want to run collaborative AI.
00:30:05.143 - 00:31:07.565, Speaker E: For example, think about banks, for example. So they're in a difficult position because they're facing. They have to serve two sets of regulations which are not very compatible. So on the one hand they have bank privacy regulations and data privacy regulations that are all about do not share your customer information with anyone else. On the other hand, what they have is AML regulations anti money laundering which are about get me insights and find out when a transaction between two banks is suspicious or not and it's laundering money or not. So those two requirements cannot be satisfied without privacy. And in this case, you would want to run a collaborative network between the banks that runs decentralized AI with this privacy component in so that the banks can run AI algorithms to detect fraudulent patterns that correspond to illicit money flows and actually can stop them.
00:31:07.565 - 00:31:41.511, Speaker E: And this is a huge problem. It's like a trillion dollar problem Every year a trillion dollar worth of fraudulent transactions go through the banking system. So this is a huge problem and it could be solved with decentralized AI. And you can build the same type of collaborative infrastructure where you want to run AI between companies without sharing information. You can think the same in other verticals, like for example, airlines. You could think the same for health so that they can do research together without sharing information from their patients. You can think even about cybersecurity.
00:31:41.511 - 00:33:05.575, Speaker E: So companies are sharing cybersecurity information about the attacks they're suffering and the problems that they've had, so that you create this early awareness or alert network, but without really the embarrassment of having to tell your peers that, yeah, we've been hacked and we've lost so much money. And also supply chains is another area where this typically fits very well because you have different companies, they kind of work in alignment, but also they want to keep certain separation between their private information. They don't want to share all their business information with each other. So all these cases are cases where collaborative AI running on top of decentralized AI would be very beneficial and would open up new use cases that are not possible with centralized AI and even for retail. So coming back to the speed question, I think speed will become less important as AI grows in intelligence and it becomes more and more independent. Right now our relationship with AI is like when you hire this new intern and you know, you have to supervise them essentially you have to break down problems into smaller pieces, feed them with the problems, and then you have to double check on the answers. That's the way we interact with LLMs nowadays.
00:33:05.575 - 00:33:43.205, Speaker E: But as they become more and more intelligent, this will change. This relationship will move to coaching, which is like a basketball coach. You know, they're just giving some higher level instructions. But then players, or in this case the AI is doing also its own part with a decent amount of independence. I would argue that this is where agents are more or less located in the scale. But then you go beyond that to mentoring, which is now you adopt this kind of more strategic position. You're no longer operational at the same level as the AI.
00:33:43.205 - 00:34:20.331, Speaker E: You're kind of giving some strategic guidance as to what is important, what not. You're thinking about providing them with the right information and contacts so that in this case the LLMs or the AI can properly function, but you're not, you know, hands deep into the operational stuff. And then the final stage is delegation. That's when you define like a playground. And inside of that playground you give full freedom to the AI. Like you say, look, this is your budget. I want you to surprise me with a trip for these holidays.
00:34:20.331 - 00:35:34.475, Speaker E: And then the AI does the rest with that budget. It contacts the different agencies, finds out information, learns about you and so on, and gives you the surprise. So as we do that and move across those different stages, speed is less of a matter because the interactions become less frequent, but also more meaningful, more interesting. But privacy becomes more interesting and more necessary because those interactions are now really sensitive. You're giving really sensitive information as a, as a, you know, when you delegate than compared to when you just, you know, supervise. So again, that's another reason why I think even in a centralized environment, in the long run, privacy enhancing technologies and decentralized AI is going to make sense because those interactions are going to transition towards that point where speed is less important and privacy is more important and decentralization as well, like who controls that service and who can take advantage of that service. So, yeah, that's kind of in a nutshell where I think we can compete with centralized AI.
00:35:35.495 - 00:35:48.235, Speaker B: Perfect. And you kind of gave the answer to my next question, but I want to hear it again. Why is Nillian Building decentralized AI or building in decentralized AI?
00:35:48.745 - 00:36:46.965, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's the challenge of the 21st century. I think there's nothing so important right now to get right as a society, because our whole future hinges on how this challenge will get resolved. So I think this is a transformational technology is going to impact every niche, every vertical, every market the same way. And so the decisions we make around who controls this technology and about minimizing the trust we place on the infrastructure that provisions this service, on the infrastructure that manipulates all this sensitive information, it's going to be really, really important. I think as a company working in both decentralization and privacy, it is our responsibility to. To tackle this challenge.
00:36:47.785 - 00:36:49.753, Speaker B: Perfect. Thank you so much, Miguel.
00:36:49.929 - 00:36:50.817, Speaker E: You're welcome.
00:36:50.961 - 00:36:59.857, Speaker B: Okay, what about alts? Are alts cooked if Kamala Harris wins? That's my main question, because I don't care about bitcoin at all. I only own alts.
00:36:59.961 - 00:37:22.925, Speaker A: So I think very cooked. Excuse me? I think that the down. I mean, I just think of, like, putting. Putting on my macro hat, which I, like, try not to wear, but I just think of, like, the up and up down beta capture of these things. And like, they have a lot of down beta, and they, like, don't have as much up beta as they used to have. So, like, you end up. The ratio just does.
00:37:22.925 - 00:37:36.815, Speaker A: It hasn't been working for a long time, I feel, for like, more than six months. So I feel like it's. Unless you get the clear, like the all clear from a Trump win, I feel like it's really, really hard to justify going out on the risk spectrum.
00:37:37.515 - 00:38:07.079, Speaker C: It's hard. It's hard to get excited about alts because I feel like there's. There's like two kind of. There's a lot of downside factors and very little up. I feel like, like there's. It's all kind of hanging on this ideal of a Trump when clearing the regulatory landscape, but there's basically like, yeah, there's that. Plus I just feel like I don't know how you guys feel about this, but it just feels like a lot of, a lot of altcoin launches are, are kind of broken in terms of just like their prices, their value, how that values are created, et cetera, et cetera.
00:38:07.079 - 00:38:33.435, Speaker C: Like, you know, I was, I was, as you mentioned earlier, the show, like, I joined in on those analyst calls and you know, one of them that you guys talked about was like jito, which is just like such a fantastic protocol and it's doing really good things for the Solana network and you know, it's, it's creating real economic value. But then I look at the token price and the fully delighted value and I'm like, well, shit, like you. You know, the, the gains have already been made on this. It's a fantastic protocol. But like, what am I going to do about it? You know, I don't want to buy this thing.
00:38:34.495 - 00:38:58.255, Speaker A: There's a lot of wacky valuations. I think that the better example is the, the I token. Yeah, right. Yeah, like, like, like literally a valueless thing, like has no path to value accrual, has all this TVL and doesn't do anything with it. And what is it, four or five billion dollar valuation. Like the market is getting smarter. Like you're watching this L2S launch at lower and lower valuations.
00:38:58.255 - 00:39:03.843, Speaker A: The market's learning always slower than I anticipated. Yeah, it's like these.
00:39:03.979 - 00:39:04.735, Speaker B: Yep.
00:39:05.315 - 00:39:11.427, Speaker C: Yeah. So you kind of. You have to fix that part and the election part. So it's like, man, this is tough right now. Yeah.
00:39:11.491 - 00:39:31.149, Speaker B: For what it's worth, like Ryan, you said it. They've just been getting smacked like scroll launched. Just horrible. PA It's. No one's even given it. I think the first one was Stark that launched and people were like, oh, like airdrop fractal stark. You know, let's take a risk then ZK sync.
00:39:31.149 - 00:39:47.055, Speaker B: Nobody even said that. And it was like we've recognized now that we've gone a bit far. Gido. I don't know, I feel like it can get a bit sillier. Not financial advice, but I gon is. Yeah, definitely. Four bill is still start at 10, I think.
00:39:47.835 - 00:40:04.855, Speaker C: Brutal. Yeah. People don't even do like the. Yeah, like you say the airdrop fractal, you know, like, like buy the initial claim dump and then like sell it three days later. Like I used to run that all the time and it was awesome last cycle, but now everybody's smart about it and they're like, oh, we're not even going to do that part. We're just going to bleed to zero.
00:40:05.595 - 00:40:53.167, Speaker D: Yeah, I completely agree. I think even for myself, like, I've had a complete lack of interest in 99% of alts for probably the past year, honestly, because of those, these reasons. And I think, you know, we're seeing it as like a, as a market and as like a sector. And you see it on X, the Everything app quite a lot now of this, this ongoing discussion of like, should we bring back ICOs? Like, do we need to just like unlock all insiders day one and like just push those FTVs down naturally due to the market? I think these are. It's a tough question because it's like you can, you know, unlock investors even sooner than they already do. And I don't know that that's like the, you know, perfectly correct answer. But I also don't know that like going just right back to ICOs, which we've had problems with in the past, is, is the correct answer either.
00:40:53.167 - 00:41:07.615, Speaker D: There's probably some blend of things that have not been quite tried yet to improve the current scenario, but certainly like Starknet going to 30 billion FTV was a clear signal that these things were incredibly, incredibly overpriced and just made no sense.
00:41:08.275 - 00:41:41.001, Speaker B: I'm gonna say two things. First of all, I think ICOs, it would take us around three months for those to get to the point where it's like, okay, like initial maybe raises are at 100mil, 200mil and then we get back to the free floor bill, three months maximum. Second thing, I think Andrew Kang was talking about that unlocking everybody, like all investors day one and they're like, I think that's probably the stupidest thing that you can do. Like if you give somebody 10x from day one and you're like, you're unlocked, but you actually don't have to stay in like no vesting schedule.
00:41:41.033 - 00:41:42.325, Speaker C: That was it.
00:41:42.665 - 00:41:53.529, Speaker B: It seems like willfully ignorant or like, I don't want to hurt his feelings, but it just seems plain stupid to argue that we should unlock people from day one. Everybody.
00:41:53.577 - 00:42:30.855, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean people, people might hate me for this, but like, it feels like, I don't know, we're coming back full circle to just the traditional venture capital framework, which is just like stage gate liquidity events based on performance of the company. Why are we putting the cart before the horse here and just giving everybody tokens when the product hasn't even found proc market fit? But you follow that logic and it's like, yeah, well, we don't want to go the other way and just give everybody liquidity event on day one. But the other side of that is like almost it's getting back to like square one of just like a traditional venture capital framework.
00:42:31.675 - 00:43:05.021, Speaker A: I think if I were forced to. Yeah, if you were like forced to design a system where you could unlock everyone day one, you would want. I think you have to pair it with like public doxing. You have to match it with ultimate transparency. And maybe that's, maybe that's net better than the current model that we have in tradfi markets where like you get options and you're locked and it takes a long time to get out of the thing. But you know, there's a reason that locks exist. But like public shaming is also very effective.
00:43:05.021 - 00:43:24.739, Speaker A: Right? So like if you knew everyone on the team, like their public address and they were all tagged on Etherscan or whatever, and you could see live who's selling and who isn't, like, I don't know, that could be just as good and the market could front run you. Right. Like once you see the CEO of some project that you really like selling, like, okay, you can dump before him.
00:43:24.907 - 00:43:49.565, Speaker B: But we already kind of have that. Everybody knows that investors are selling TIA and like we try to shame them, but it doesn't work. It's just like they're like, okay, like Burnitzky has bull posted from $12 all the way down to whatever it is that right now we've shamed my entire pair. People were calling for him to go to jail at $4 and he doesn't care at all. It's just like, hey, guys, buy TIA right now. It's a great token.
00:43:49.645 - 00:44:09.105, Speaker A: Well, do you know their, their specific. Like are there addresses in the docs? In the docs? No, in the documentation. Yeah, like put the addresses in the, in the documentation or something like that. You know, like we have a very, very. Like most people are just guessing. They're like, this wallet appears to be investors. This might be happening.
00:44:09.975 - 00:44:40.905, Speaker C: Yeah. You know what I find funny is that how little we actually use this on chain visible world that we have. Okay, so speaking. But we don't want to rag on Eigen too much, but when that whole thing happened where some locked tokens got transferred, I was like, wait, how is it possible for them to sell locked tokens? Can't you just lock them in the smart contract? And then I got told that we don't actually do that because of legal reasons or something. So we just escrow Them. And I'm like, what? Like, we have this technology to lock the tokens and we don't use them. Are you kidding me right now?
00:44:41.925 - 00:45:14.945, Speaker B: To be fair, and I'm not defending them, they had some weird. I, I pretty, like, I, I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure they got some weird advice because they were told like, oh, you have to wait four months, like to make it transferable. So I think they just had, they just had like some guy was like joking around with them and mocking them or something because like you said, it makes no sense. Why would you have to legally not do smart contracts? But that, I think that was probably like the start of the end for aigen. We'll see how they turn out. But not locking your own tokens in a smart contract is silly. And I think getting.
00:45:16.245 - 00:45:57.625, Speaker D: I was just going to say, I, I, like, I do think, Ryan, like, you're making a great point here about just transparency of insiders, like, and their wallets. It, it is incredibly ironic, like how transparent and visible blockchains are meant to be. And yet we, like, like you said, you don't know who, like which wallet is the CEO's wallet and like how many tokens they have. Like, you can guess, you can go and look at the amounts and like check the allocation schedule and like maybe figure out some of them. But there's not like a clear list of like these are all the addresses of the insiders and you can't check when they're all selling, but I can go up and look up. You know, when Brian Armstrong sells his coin stock, it's easy to find online. So it's hilarious to me that that like dichotomy exists when it's supposed to be far more transparent.
00:45:57.625 - 00:46:18.325, Speaker D: When it's all available on chain, that would probably be, I think, incredibly helpful. It would take away a lot of that illusion of like, you know, this guy's bull posting this token up 10,000x on Twitter, but he's been dumping it for months. Like it would take away a lot of that. Like just complete clash of ideas that I think people get when they read about things versus, like what is actually happening.
00:46:18.665 - 00:46:30.465, Speaker B: To be fair, if you're on EVM, you can spend around 30 minutes and figure out everybody's address because of frantic, like back in the day, everybody connected their thing. So if it's an EVM token, you can figure out, I don't know if.
00:46:31.885 - 00:46:35.305, Speaker D: Assuming they don't use some other address to do all of their.
00:46:40.045 - 00:46:57.619, Speaker B: Let's go back to we, we never finished our conversation. We said alts to zero. If Kamala wins, if Trump wins, what do we say? I wanna, basically I want to talk a bit more about the election because I haven't gotten to say exactly what I think, but I want everybody else to say their opinion first and then I want to give my opinion.
00:46:57.707 - 00:47:44.995, Speaker C: Yeah, okay, I'll add one more thing and then, and then let's hear your thoughts. But this is something I threw around in the chat before we got on here. But like what if, okay, what if Kamala wins and you know, alts go to zero but all, you know, we start to see this, this, this trend of consolidation of capital into Bitcoin and Ethereum because they're the only like green lighted assets and we actually see a bid there and like, I don't know, I've never actually looked at like bitcoin ETH dominance together. But like if we just separate them for this argument, I don't know, like if you just saw them both run up super hard would be just absolute max pain. And maybe the only reason that you get like a, you know, an increase, like a decent move in, in the like on a sole ETH ratio is, is because of, is because of that. And, and that Solana just barely missed the mark of being given that, that green light as an asset class. That would be tough.
00:47:44.995 - 00:47:47.019, Speaker C: I don't know how likely that is. I don't know what you guys think.
00:47:47.067 - 00:47:53.215, Speaker B: But Eve's flows have just been so, so bad. Like the ETF flows have just been.
00:47:53.795 - 00:48:00.195, Speaker D: Yeah, 00 bud. Nobody's buying them.
00:48:00.355 - 00:48:01.131, Speaker C: No.
00:48:01.323 - 00:48:33.775, Speaker B: Oh, it's MBT. What I wanted to my hot take is that election doesn't matter and the cycle has been the same cycle it's always been. Bitcoin is leading. If you look at any like chart, that's whatever, soul, btc, etc, it's actually not up that much over the year. Like we have very clear BTC dominance and then we're gonna flow into I guess like riskier and riskier assets throughout. I don't think anything has. Do you get what I'm trying to say? Like I don't think the cycles meaningfully change just because there's an election or just because the institutions are here.
00:48:33.775 - 00:48:41.985, Speaker B: What do you think? Like it's the same. Do you guys know that chart where it's like BTC, alts, meme coins, NFDs?
00:48:42.605 - 00:48:58.237, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. I mean it feels like every four year we get to the juncture of everybody requestioning. Is there a cycle? Is the Cycle over and more often not. It gets proven to be still intact. So I think there's a fair point there. We always overthink it in the moment, but then you look back and you're like, oh, it was obvious.
00:48:58.237 - 00:49:00.917, Speaker C: Bitcoin runs first and then everything else runs later.
00:49:01.061 - 00:49:22.277, Speaker A: Yes, cycle over is different than BTC going down 20. Right. Cycle over kind of implies like 70 down move for the majors. So yeah, that's, that's not in my expectations. And I actually think that the. What, like, you know, you're not supposed to say this time is different. I totally disagree.
00:49:22.277 - 00:50:03.341, Speaker A: I think every time is different and that's what makes it interesting. And that's like where the alpha is. And the reason this time is different is because you have institutional players touching the benchmark asset of the entire asset class that everything else moves on. They're arming it, they're minimizing like the, you see it in the volatility profile of bitcoin. It's clearly changed. It's, it's down to the right on and the annualized volume and implied falls there. So I, I think that, look, you can always find similarities in the cycle, but I think this cycle is clearly different because of, you know, the institutional adoption of this asset and that.
00:50:03.341 - 00:50:05.305, Speaker A: And that's what's interesting about it.
00:50:06.165 - 00:50:46.665, Speaker C: I'm curious for what you guys think about, you know, like, when we got these big ETF flows into Bitcoin, like, I don't know, 10 months ago or whatever it was, there was talk about, oh, you know, we're not going to see an alt season anymore because traditionally what happens is people get rich on bitcoin and then move some of those profits, you know, further out the risk curve. But if that's all stuck away and siloed in ETF gains, does that transfer into alt gains? What do you guys think about that one? Like, do you think it could still happen or. Because, you know, my way of thinking it is like, okay, but whoever's. There's always a seller to every buyer, you know, so there has to be somebody on the other side that's, that's selling, you know, that bitcoin to whoever is buying it on the other side and they might go do something else with it. But I'm curious what you guys think.
00:50:46.825 - 00:51:17.325, Speaker D: Yeah, personally, I don't know that I've ever taken it so literally to mean that everyone who owns a big fat bag of bitcoin is selling it to buy pepe when, when bitcoin goes up. Maybe that's true. I don't know if that's necessarily the case. I would have, I would have a strong feeling that like it's a lot of, you know, it, it draws attention. You know, people come look, they, they bring in additional capital because assets are up. Like it's, it's the same old thing of like, you know, they hated it at 60k but they'll love to buy it. Handover fist at 85k.
00:51:17.325 - 00:51:52.295, Speaker D: And I think it's just one of those things like you know, more attention comes when price rises and like people get more excited and they have, maybe they have extra cash on the sides. Maybe new participants come in and they, you know, they see the shiny thing and maybe they don't even want to buy bitcoin because now it's, you know, it's at all time highs but they decide hey, I want to buy Pepe or I want to buy eth or buy this other thing that's smaller and it, and it can run up, you know, higher, higher multiples than a bitcoin could. But yeah, I don't, I don't know that like that there's so much backing behind this theory that like all these, all these bitcoin millionaires are selling their bitcoin every time it goes up so they can buy alts. I just don't know that that makes any sense.
00:51:53.065 - 00:52:05.289, Speaker A: It's hard to know. I don't have the data. It's, it's hard. It's hard to know. Yeah, it's hard. It's, it's hard to know. No opinion.
00:52:05.417 - 00:52:58.983, Speaker B: I agree with you though. I, I'm not sure if I think that people get rich on bitcoin and I always thought it was more of a catch up thing where like, and then you're like aunt finds out that there's, you can actually make like a garillion percent on Olympus for works and then that's how like she makes a tick tock about it. You know, that's how it works. And it's not like actually like people buying bitcoin and they're like wow, now I have $15,000, I'm gonna put 50 of that in Pepe. That to me makes less sense then because even now like this weekend I talked to somebody which was huge for me but, and I was like, I told them what I do and they were like, oh, is that even like still a thing? Like there's a vast majority of the world out there that is just like bitcoin's at all time highs. Last week I, I cried Tears of joy. And this guy doesn't even know that it's like doing well.
00:52:58.983 - 00:53:08.795, Speaker B: So to me, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I think he's just gonna be like, you said Danny, 85K. He's like, wow, I need some of this right now. Or like Pepe or whatever.
00:53:09.135 - 00:53:46.205, Speaker D: Yeah, the, the mental picture that I have today is, and especially probably of the younger crowd is like, they see that happen and I just think that the impression that they have and maybe if they have any memories of a prior cycle, it's like, wow, when that happened, like the dog coin went crazy and went on SNL and like people made a thousand X on that thing. I'm going to buy the new dog coin. And then they go look for. They go in the trenches, right? And they look like they look for their favorite meme and they buy it. I just don't envision these people, you know, these, these participants that come in and they're like, okay, time to like drop my 5k in my bank account into bitcoin.
00:53:46.945 - 00:54:01.193, Speaker B: Oh, nobody cares about sovereign currency. They just want to buy skibidi toilet or whatever and you know, get a 15x or something. Which makes a lot of sense as well. But I don't know. That's just. Ryan, do you know what skibidi toilet means?
00:54:01.329 - 00:54:02.005, Speaker A: No.
00:54:04.075 - 00:54:04.935, Speaker C: I do.
00:54:08.995 - 00:54:14.295, Speaker B: Danny, what's our last topic? I think we Opensea or. What do you want to do? Poly market.
00:54:15.515 - 00:54:42.303, Speaker D: We could talk about Polymarket. We. I guess we haven't brought that up. So I guess we have an election event. I think there's been a lot of controversy about the value of prediction markets post a 2024 election. Considering I think I'd have to pull up the dashboard. If you want to pull up our dashboard voxel that breakdown, but I believe it's like something like 70 plus of all volumes are still on election or political related markets on poly market today.
00:54:42.303 - 00:55:07.615, Speaker D: So the big concern here is like post election, is it. Is it dead until 2028? Like, you know, if you go back and look at Auger, are we doomed to see the same result here? Or can they achieve adoption via sports, via like pop culture stuff? Those are maybe some of the, you know, best examples I've seen. But I don't know if there's.
00:55:08.635 - 00:55:22.875, Speaker B: Well, I'm gonna give some background. Yeah, I'm gonna. And it's not. It's not just politics as well. Most of it is literally just elections. Like if you look over here oi today, 330mil is just on elections. And politics is another 90mil.
00:55:22.875 - 00:55:58.007, Speaker B: And then the remainder is like sports is 10mil crypto stem. Everything else is really like negligible. Yeah, I'm not like, we talk about this, it feels like every morning nowadays because election is so soon. But I'm definitely like, I don't think that sports makes a lot of sense on these betting apps. I think it's just not as fun as like doing a parlay on your phone nfa. But yeah. What do you guys think, Felix? Let's start.
00:55:58.031 - 00:57:20.297, Speaker C: I think, yeah, I think they need to, if they want to continue the success after the election, they need to reframe how they sell it a little bit. Because when you look at like where some of the other djin speculation occurs, it's like, it's basically the same as people like buying out of the money options, you know, where it's just like, okay, you, you go find something where it's like, you know, people are starting to speculate and I'm like, yeah, what words would Trump say in, in a given speech? Or like, you know, you can extrapolate that into a whole bunch of different things and then you're like, all right, similar to, you know, some of the excitement of, of like hitting. Yeah, like a multi, like, parlay in sports betting. Like, you know, that's what really gets people to show up every day, even though the odds are like ridiculously low. Like, I think if they can reframe the narrative around this, that same idea of allowing a place for people to basically speculate on, like, out of the money calls on like random things as opposed to like, you know, going to find like this major event that's occurring and where there's like 50, 50 odds, like, I don't know, there's not a lot of edge there to be found, to be honest. In the same way that like in sports betting, you know, like actually betting on the winner, like, there's not that much edge to be found, I find, versus just like doing something kind of funky and weird more at the risk of. So, you know, I feel like, yeah, if they can reframe the narrative a little bit about what you can do on there where it's like, it's a place to, I don't know, like, pull in the people that are doing zero DD like options in tradfi or like.
00:57:20.297 - 00:57:34.193, Speaker C: Yeah, like that. Or like sports. Yeah, like multi, like parlay player type people. You can repeat that in Polymarket. So I feel like if they lean into that better, they could retain some excitement. But I don't know, that's. That's a lot of marketing, branding work to do.
00:57:34.329 - 00:57:56.469, Speaker B: Yeah. I thought they would do well with live stream. And I agree with you, by the way. Like, they need to rerun the whole thing. I thought it would make sense to do live stream betting and like influencer betting, like always. Kaiser not gonna say phantom text on Twitch or something, but we looked at the data for this as well, and it's like, ridiculously low. I think it's.
00:57:56.469 - 00:58:17.991, Speaker B: It's supposed to be like it's under pop culture, which is. It's negligible. It's like 4 mil volume out of whatever, 500, 600 mil. So it's. It's like, I don't think maybe they'll be able to go into it, but to me, it doesn't feel like something people want to bet on. Sports is something people love. Betting on women's tennis and Indonesian second league Soccer.
00:58:17.991 - 00:58:23.195, Speaker B: That's stuff they want to bet on but not on influencers. So unless they can figure it out.
00:58:23.895 - 00:59:09.315, Speaker D: Yeah. Not to make everything about meme coins or parlays, but I think the points there ring pretty true. Like, when you look at the average person who's like, doing sports bets, like, they're, they're, you know, getting more and more into these parlay bets, and those make those businesses more money than the regular bets do. I think the, the biggest, the biggest drawback for poly market today is like, if you lose elections and there's not these. This big market for Evan to bet on, there's not unlimited upside for trades. Like, you can't hit a 100x thousand x on this thing. And when you're already in like this crypto space, like, you can just jump over into the trenches and trade things at stupid tiny market caps and hope that they do that 100,000x on like a sort of lottery ticket type of bet.
00:59:09.315 - 00:59:35.395, Speaker D: So I think that's really something that, like, they need to figure out a way to offer as a product is, you know, if it's leverage or if it's like some kind of parlay system where you can like, tie these things together, give yourself lower odds of hitting, but a higher outcome reward. That's. That's probably how you're going to get like, you know, the de. Basically the degenerate people who are into all these applications to spend more money on them or make it more.
00:59:37.215 - 00:59:43.887, Speaker B: Composable into the rest of crypto. Like, I will. Let me borrow on my. Whatever my.
00:59:44.031 - 01:00:10.645, Speaker C: I have a question on that point that I want to. While I have the research gigabrains here. How do you guys feel about the fact that the most successful crypto app is on Polygon? Because I'm just looking right now. Maddox just hit an all time low at the same time that the most successful crypto app is on Polygon and is getting. What does that say about this whole, like, I don't know, like, you know, what's the. The fat L1 thesis or whatever? Like, how do you feel about that? Because that is pretty wild to me.
01:00:11.105 - 01:00:20.393, Speaker B: Before Ryan's gonna give his opinion, I just want to say it's not only on Polygon. They also named the app after Poly Polygon. Like they were so in love with.
01:00:20.529 - 01:00:21.521, Speaker C: The chain that they were.
01:00:21.553 - 01:00:27.405, Speaker B: We're gonna name this Polygon Market Polymarket. Ryan, you can go ahead.
01:00:27.935 - 01:01:07.039, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's the most successful in terms of mainstream mindshare. But like, so I've known about Predictit for a long time and it was on the Bloomberg terminal and everyone looked at predicted odds in the 2016 and 2020 elections and it had like less than $100 million in volume. Right. And Polymarket has totally leapfrogged it. Like, these things are very easy to cite. The market price is very easy to cite. But like, it really hasn't translated into like, like meaningful dollars into those systems.
01:01:07.039 - 01:01:36.353, Speaker A: So, like, what's the total volume on Poly Market? It's. It's a billion. And there's that. Depending on how you want to count that volume, it perhaps it's double counted if you wanted to count that volume, like as you would on a Dex or in a trading system. So, you know, I think it's. I think it's filled a niche. Like, I think it has like, really like impressive mainstream mind share, but I don't know if I would frame it as like a six from a dollar outcome perspective.
01:01:36.353 - 01:01:50.831, Speaker A: I don't think it's been that successful. And you need a lot of things for the chain to be successful. Like you need like trading things, drive fees to the chain. So it's, you know, when you need priority access and you really don't need that for these betting markets.
01:01:50.993 - 01:02:17.403, Speaker C: Yeah, I asked that because it brings up this question of what's good for as a crypto app and adoption versus being a good investment because there's all this happening. But again, the Maddox tokens is down only and there's no Polygon token or anything or, sorry, polymarket token. So it's like, okay, that's awesome. And I think about stable coins too. That's the big winner in terms of use case. But again, there's not a lot of ways to really enjoy the upside of that.
01:02:17.539 - 01:02:35.011, Speaker B: Yeah, you know what? I'll. I'll maybe add on a bit to what Ryan said. I, I think Polymarket's a really good app. Can you imagine? Like, I wish they had also done a phone app. I think they would have done such, like, so much better if they weren't on Polygon. They would have also done much better. Like that's.
01:02:35.011 - 01:03:04.671, Speaker B: I think they would have done maybe double the volume. But first of all, I guess it doesn't matter what chain you launch on. Like, that's the very obvious thing. But the second thing is, like Brian said, there's some apps that work well with the rest of the chain and some that don't, like Pump Fun, Radium, Jupiter and any trading bot. These just work very, very well together. Like, they're symbiotic. You can even like, consider them the same ecosystem or like secondary tertiary apps to each other.
01:03:04.671 - 01:03:24.971, Speaker B: There's obviously no clear way for Polymarket to get into that. They're. They're not building lending primitives on Polymarket market, unfortunately. They should. Like, if I'm Polygon, I would have just leaned into it as much as possible. Build out like two, three more apps because you have money, you're a massive chain. Do a grants program, you have one successful app, like build a.
01:03:24.971 - 01:03:53.823, Speaker B: Try and build this ecosystem around. They didn't, but. And now we're seeing more and more people, more and more chains try and capture this like, breakout consumer app. And I don't think Polygon ever really tried to do that. I think Peter Field was just somehow in love with Polygon or like Founders Fund, and that's why they launched over there. Ryan, you can call me an idiot if I'm wrong, but that's like, what I understand. They have some weird fascination with Polygon, which is why it launched on Poly.
01:03:53.823 - 01:03:55.475, Speaker B: There's no other reason, though.
01:03:56.535 - 01:04:05.229, Speaker A: I'm not sure. But it's not, it's not Peter Steel who's making these investments. Like, it's his, it's the people underneath him. I don't think he cares about crypto at all.
01:04:05.407 - 01:04:19.009, Speaker B: I think Peter Thiel cares a lot about crypto, specifically Polymarket. But no, even if he doesn't, what I'm saying is they just got lucky and now we're seeing a bunch of chains try and copy them, come up with some breakout consumer app.
01:04:19.137 - 01:05:19.335, Speaker A: Well, the thing that I want to go back to my point about what matters for the bottom line of a chain. And my thinking on this has changed. When Instagram said that they were going to use Arweave and Ethereum and solana to do NFTs late in 2021 when they were like pivoting to the Metaverse thing, like I thought that was a really big deal. And like yeah, let's say if they onboarded all 1 billion MAUs on Instagram and like they all got an NFT, yeah that would be a really big deal. But none of them are paying for priority access to state. The real like revenue drivers for the underlying L1s are like the degens and the trading firms like they want to make quick money over here, then they pay for priority access to come over here and then they leverage up over here. Like they're constantly interacting with the chain and they need to like literally buy specific slots of state to maximize profit.
01:05:19.335 - 01:05:57.415, Speaker A: Which is, you know, you're seeing mev tips as a percentage of like total revenue for these chains start start to dominate. So a successful app like an NFT app where I don't know you buy 12 NFTs a year as a user is like never going to drive meaningful revenue for the underlying for the underlying chain. Especially in this like very low fee environment that we're, we're going to probably be in for the foreseeable future. It's like the, it's the defi trading apps that are going to be the real revenue driver. So like not that surprising to me that predict it wasn't enough for Polygon or it hasn't been enough so far.
01:05:57.875 - 01:07:01.401, Speaker D: Yeah, I think even in, even in the case to back to your point Felix, like where Pump Fun is driving meaningful like rev to salon of the chain just and Meme Coins in general like trading of of Meme Coins is is doing appreciable things to tips and activity on Solana. Still though like if, if you had the ability to trade like the value of Pump Fun relative to Seoul, like that would have been the far better trade. You know, looking back to the summer, seeing that it was declining, like you had an opportunity there where if it was, if there was some public asset backing Pump Fun that would have been the far better asset to buy than Seoul in this case. I do think to your point like while there, there is value that is going back to the chain in the case of something like a pump fund just due to the massive amount of of trading and arbitrage and bots and tips and all these things, ultimately the apps are capturing most of this. They're closer to the user. They're, they're charging 1% on, on volumes that run through their app and they're making an absolute crap ton of money off of that. So I think that's going to continue to be the case.
01:07:01.401 - 01:07:18.135, Speaker D: And if like in the future, if Sol is not the right place for them, which I mean, I'm just making this up, but like hypothetically, if Solana is no longer the blockchain that pump fund wanted to be on, they could just as easily jump somewhere else. And if they have all the user mind share, like those users are going to go with them and it's the same for any other chain.
01:07:18.435 - 01:07:41.955, Speaker B: By the way. That's my bull case for crypto is that these apps can launch slap on a 0.5% fee, make billions, millions, but like pump funds make 160 mil. That's like pure to the team. I think that pulls in like crypto lock sexiness to AI. But I think it comes back. Well, the money comes back.
01:07:42.115 - 01:07:55.015, Speaker C: Yeah. And I feel like the last piece of that puzzle from there is like, okay, now that you got cash flows going into apps, if they launch a token, but you can actually have that token, have a claim on those cash flows, then you got something going. But you know, as of now it's just governance coins mostly.
01:07:55.915 - 01:07:58.295, Speaker D: And then that's where it ties back to the election.
01:07:58.635 - 01:08:00.015, Speaker C: Yes, exactly.
01:08:00.795 - 01:08:23.475, Speaker B: I think for the foreseeable future, will, I also don't think like, even if there wasn't a legal aspect to it, I'm not a lawyer, this is not legal advice. I think it still wouldn't matter. I don't think that teams want to let go of that value. These people, like they make millions and millions. I don't even think they'd want to give up like 10, 20% of that. Token holders, what do you think?
01:08:23.815 - 01:08:25.755, Speaker C: Depends if they want their token to do well.
01:08:27.335 - 01:08:28.439, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess.
01:08:28.607 - 01:08:48.297, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I guess there's a scenario here, right? There's no pump fund token today. So like we could speculate on a potential value. But if they gave none of the money back then like why would you buy it? But so if one did exist, like you'd want to be trading those revenues that are like flowing to the business, not, not all straight into the pockets of the team. That would not be a very good business to buy.
01:08:48.441 - 01:09:02.725, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, you know, just like any company, you know, it's like do you give out a dividend or do you reinvest the profits? And as a holder of that token, like, depending on that composition, like, you'll either want to hold it or not hold it. And I. You want to balance between those two things.
01:09:03.305 - 01:09:10.009, Speaker D: But if. If they were a company, like, given they've made over 100 million in, you know, six months or so, it would be worth quite a lot.
01:09:10.057 - 01:09:12.685, Speaker C: So it would be worth quite a lot. Yeah.
01:09:13.945 - 01:09:20.925, Speaker B: Are we good? Ryan, Danny, Felix, Anything we want to bring up before I end it, before I wrap it up?
01:09:21.305 - 01:09:30.301, Speaker C: No, I just. Yeah. Thanks for inviting me. It's a ton of fun. I love, love listening to you guys. Love to be a part of it. It's fun to talk about more in the weeds, crypto stuff.
01:09:30.301 - 01:09:36.905, Speaker C: You know, we keep it pretty high level at 4 guidance of just like the impact of macro on crypto. So it's fun to get into it.
01:09:37.925 - 01:09:44.905, Speaker D: Is it ironic that we collectively all said alts are garbage? I don't know. The viewers can decide.
01:09:51.405 - 01:09:53.305, Speaker A: Alts aren't garbage. If you tried.
01:09:54.005 - 01:10:23.201, Speaker B: I did not say that. I said. Felix, thanks for coming on. I do feel kind of bad that we spoke mostly about the election. I really wanted to do like a half, half episode where it was like a bit about the election and then the second half was mostly about other stuff. But I really, really appreciate you coming on. And I will say forward guidance and before that, on the margin are the only macro pods that I can listen to without me going like, you know, like, typically I'm like.
01:10:23.201 - 01:10:33.817, Speaker B: But those two are the only ones. Maybe it's because I. It's block works, but I think mostly it's because I like. I actually like the pods, so even. Thanks for coming.
01:10:33.841 - 01:10:38.325, Speaker C: Appreciate that. Yeah. We'll have to do it again and we can talk more about in the trenches stuff.
01:10:38.705 - 01:10:48.085, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I think so. All right. Ryan, do you have anything you want to say? Finally, final words? No. I'm surprised you were so quiet today. You're ex macro guy. No.
01:10:48.595 - 01:10:49.763, Speaker A: Was I quiet?
01:10:49.939 - 01:10:53.243, Speaker B: Yeah, you were very quiet. You didn't give any of your strong opinions.
01:10:53.419 - 01:10:56.667, Speaker A: I. I came out and said Trump was going to win in a landslide.
01:10:56.851 - 01:11:02.523, Speaker C: And then he said that, yeah, crypto would go absolute to the doldrums if Kamala wins. Those are pretty cool.
01:11:02.579 - 01:11:03.107, Speaker A: Zero.
01:11:03.251 - 01:11:05.171, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. I guess you didn't. Maybe.
01:11:05.283 - 01:11:09.651, Speaker D: Yeah, those are pretty spicy, Honestly, relative to what I think I've been seeing.
01:11:09.803 - 01:11:16.895, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. I hedge my bets in my prediction so I can be right regardless. That's the real secret to building an audience. Always hedging. So you're right regardless.
01:11:18.335 - 01:11:25.479, Speaker B: One thing I will say is that I really like macro because anytime data is like, doesn't go your way, it's, oh, data is too noisy. It doesn't make a lot.
01:11:25.527 - 01:11:26.039, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:11:26.127 - 01:11:28.423, Speaker B: I really like that. That's what I want to do.
01:11:28.559 - 01:11:31.695, Speaker C: Yeah. Always be correct, even when you're wrong.
