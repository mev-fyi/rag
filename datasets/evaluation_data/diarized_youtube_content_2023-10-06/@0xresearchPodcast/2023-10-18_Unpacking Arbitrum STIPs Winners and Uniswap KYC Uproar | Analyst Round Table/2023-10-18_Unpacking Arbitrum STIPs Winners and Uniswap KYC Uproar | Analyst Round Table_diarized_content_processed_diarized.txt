00:00:02.330 - 00:00:21.998, Speaker A: Hey everyone, Sam and Dan here. And before we dive into today's episode, I wanted to shout out Metamask portfolio. Are you always constantly stressed like us, managing your portfolio across different chains, wallets, lp positions, perps positions? I'm excited to tell you about Metamask portfolio, which lets you manage all of your crypto assets across different networks, wallets all in one place.
00:00:22.084 - 00:00:27.590, Speaker B: Do more with web3 your way with Metamask portfolio, Leo. You'll hear a little bit more about it later in the show.
00:00:27.660 - 00:01:04.510, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Zero X Research. We have a great interview lined up with the Blockworks research team today. We're going to be joined by Matt and Brick, making his debut. Before we get into that, want to give a quick shout out to our sponsor, Hexons. They're one of the most hardcore security teams in web3. Pioneering in ZK and novel cryptography, Hexens is trusted by tier one protocols like Polygon, including their work on their new ZK, EVM, Mantle, Risk Zero, Lido, one inch, newbank and more. You'll hear about them a little bit more later in the show from Dan, but I also want to remind everyone to use code Zero X research ten at checkout@blockworksresearch.com.
00:01:04.510 - 00:01:14.050, Speaker A: If you're interested in leading industry research, data and governance updates, today is October 16. Dan, how about I just kick it over to you to get things started off for sure.
00:01:14.200 - 00:01:56.362, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll kick things off with a top movers and biggest losers section. Get us moving with the top mover. And that's definitely the bitcoin running on the news of the spot ETF this morning. So today's Monday, as Sam mentioned, and woke up this morning to some what seemed like to be great news. There was a cointelegraph tweet that went out just kind of saying the SEC has approved the iShares, which is Blackrock's spot bitcoin ETF. So obviously this is huge news that the market's been anticipating for months and months and quite honestly, years, and it's pushing towards formulation. It was just last week where Grayscale had another positive step in their ETF battle with the SEC, just regarding their GBTC fund.
00:01:56.362 - 00:02:16.466, Speaker B: And so it's like, all right, we kind of seems like we're treading in that right direction. So boom, this headline hits on Monday morning. Bitcoin runs up 7%. And I was with it at first and we actually hopped on our team call. And I got to give credit to Matt here he was like, nah, this is probably fake. And there was no source anywhere. And then it kept spreading.
00:02:16.466 - 00:02:51.874, Speaker B: But then everyone just kept sourcing the original tweet, which had no know first step. Whenever I see ETF news is definitely just go to the two Bloomberg legends, James Seifert and blanking on the other guys. Oh, Eric Baltunas. They have incredible ETF content nonstop. So I pull up their twitters and it was one of the two of them actually tweeted back at the cointelegraph tweet like source. And of course I was like, all right, there might be some credence in this not being real. And sure enough, five minutes later, I'm now putting bitcoin in the biggest losers section as it retraced the entire move.
00:02:51.874 - 00:03:24.250, Speaker B: And cointelegraph then edited their tweet to like, they added the word reportedly in there, so the SEC reportedly approves. Well, they were the first one to report it, so that was questionable there. And sure enough, about an hour or so later, the tweets deleted. An apology message comes out and it just completely seems to be false news. Fake news, whatever you want to call it. So bitcoin is actually claiming the throne for biggest mover and biggest loser, all within the ten minute span of this Monday morning. So definitely always a fun industry to work in when you have to wake up to complete chaos.
00:03:24.250 - 00:03:48.646, Speaker B: But it's also a little bit disheartening. I mean, sometimes it really does feel like we live in a clown world, and today felt no different. I was writing our newsletter this morning. I actually had a quote in there. I kind of summed up a little bit of how I felt. And it's like, one thing is true. A crypto native media outlet posted a false report that led to a 7% bitcoin candle in a matter of minutes.
00:03:48.646 - 00:04:16.474, Speaker B: And that kind of is only further proving Gensler might be right in his claim that the spot bitcoin market can be easily manipulated. But it was actually a portfolio manager from ArcA, Jeff Dormant, who was tweeting about this as well. And he was like, you know what? Every market can be easily manipulated on a major false headline. So we got to grow up and mature as an industry and let's get some true due diligence and not just be putting things out there to be first to the click rush.
00:04:16.602 - 00:04:42.082, Speaker C: I thought one of the most interesting takes in response to this, and yeah, what a crazy morning. Like, absolutely absurd. And this all went down in 30 minutes while we were on our morning call. Absurd. But bitcoin is still up 4% on the day, even now at 02:00 p.m. Some 6 hours after all this is going down. And one of the better tapes I saw was crypto Donald on Twitter, who's like, that 7% move in a five, 7810 minutes time frame shows that people are sidelined that shouldn't be sidelined.
00:04:42.082 - 00:05:21.266, Speaker C: He says that this is almost an inevitability, that a bitcoin spot ETF does get approved, and that sidelined money might now realize like, okay, maybe we should put on some exposure. Just play like devil's advocate to that. I actually do tend to agree and think that's an interesting take that now we'll have some more of that exposure priced in. So, meaning that we won't retrace the whole way down, we'll continue to see some upside. But one interesting, just to play devil's advocate to that is maybe people just are pricing in a non inevitability, a low chance that the bitcoin spot ETF does get approved soon. In which case it wasn't mispositioned money, it was just people don't think it's actually going to happen. Not sure which side I take.
00:05:21.266 - 00:05:44.890, Speaker C: I tend to agree with Crypto Donald and thought that was smart. Another interesting factor is that so much short oi got wiped on that move to the upside that there would probably be some incentive for market makers to now squeeze it out to the downside. So in other words, it's easier for market makers to push the price down than it would have been before, given that a lot of shorts got wiped out. Just think that's an interesting fact that I saw also, I guess, propagated through Twitter.
00:05:46.590 - 00:06:14.402, Speaker A: Yeah, I just don't really know how this happened. That's a pretty big blunder, to be honest. It almost seemed a little coordinated. I saw someone on Twitter saying that someone hopped in a telegram group, dropped that headline 30 minutes before it actually reached x or Twitter or whatever you want to call it. So yeah, I don't know. I also saw the coin telegraph intern, and this might have been a shit post too, but he's like, thanks for the exit liquidity, which I thought was absolutely hilarious. Twitter was just super entertaining this morning.
00:06:14.402 - 00:06:22.950, Speaker A: It felt like the good old days, like two years ago, when everyone was just screaming into the echo chamber on the way up. It was a lot more fun on CT back then.
00:06:23.100 - 00:06:39.100, Speaker B: Yeah, the at intern handle had a great tweet and I was like, we're sorry to say that we've had to formally let the cointelegraph intern. Go from the intern group. I'll put the link to that one in the show notes. But the ship hosting was pretty impressive this morning as well.
00:06:41.070 - 00:07:10.854, Speaker D: My first thought that this was how inefficient the market seems to be if you're trading news, it would have been so easy to just go long when the news comes out, and then it didn't take that long again for the market to switch and start realizing that, okay, this news probably, or this news piece doesn't hold, and then just ride it back down. So I don't know. My first thought was that, okay, there's still a lot of opportunity here, and the market seems super inefficient in that way.
00:07:11.052 - 00:07:29.610, Speaker A: 100% agree with you there. I was like, okay, Matt, I think it was you that dropped it in slack. And then I'm looking at the bitcoin price, and I'm like, all right, it's not moving. It took it, like, a minute or two to move, and then I'm like, well, this is weird. And then you had so many opportunities to short it after you kind of knew it was fake. Very od price action.
00:07:30.350 - 00:08:03.074, Speaker C: Strong agree there. It's super interesting that once price goes up 78%, it did take about 30 seconds or a minute, which is longer than I would expect. You'd think that the scalping bots would have made that happen way quicker. But three, four minutes in, I'm looking through the SEC's. I'm looking through all the SEC's recent reports, like, word that they put out. I'm looking through every response to the tweet, seeing, is there actually a source attached? Is everyone just sourcing the first tweet? And at that point, it's like, oh, shit. This news is not definitely fake, but there's no source anywhere out there on the Internet.
00:08:03.074 - 00:08:12.540, Speaker C: This 8% price move is probably not justified. And then you had, like Brick said, a solid period of time to be able to short it on the way down, too. It does feel so.
00:08:13.310 - 00:08:42.990, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And maybe this pushes us back to the original timeline for the spot bitcoin ETF, which I believe would be the Blackrock filing. That is, the last time it could be delayed or accepted or denied would be in February. And so I just pulled up the estimated bitcoin happening timeline. That's in April. And it's kind of like all things are back in order for the bitcoin spot ETF carrying us into the bitcoin happening. And really, that seems to be an exciting catalyst.
00:08:42.990 - 00:08:49.960, Speaker B: Sometimes it's just easier to think about those two things and left curve and be like, all right, everything that happens between now and then actually doesn't matter.
00:08:51.050 - 00:08:51.366, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:51.388 - 00:09:27.226, Speaker A: I also saw Eric Balchunas. I'm probably botching his name. Dan, you just mentioned him. But he said, I thought it was super weird when I saw the Blackrock one got approved because with the ETH futures ETF, they approved all of them at the same time to make sure there was no first mover advantage, because that wouldn't be very fair and it'd be like the SEC picking favorites. So I do think in the future, if you're wondering if a bitcoin ETF approval is fake or not, it'd probably be fake if it was one specific one and not all of them altogether. So that's another thing to take away from the situation. Dan, you want to head over there for some governance updates?
00:09:27.338 - 00:09:44.338, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. And so we got three for you this week. We'll start off with the stride news. They're actually going to back down from the governance buyout, or, excuse me, the cosmos hub buyout of. We had basically half an episode on this. We'll put the link to that one in the show notes.
00:09:44.338 - 00:10:13.994, Speaker B: So I won't harp too much on here, but it sounds like a lot of the community was really just against this. Whether there were some people on the stride side that were like, this is crazy, why would we do this? There were some people on the Cosmos hub side saying the exact same thing. And of course, there was people on both sides saying, what a great idea. So was all over the place. There was no clear way to being like, okay, well, if we're going to do it, here's a map of what that looks like, and this is what would make sense to us. Nobody really seemed to even put that forward. So it really never even left the ideation stage.
00:10:13.994 - 00:10:45.798, Speaker B: But now it sounds like it's being fully shelved and saved for later. And if you had any indication, if you wanted some indication of what the community thought about it, this lane on the 14 day and the 30 day time frame shride is still down 30, 35%. So a lot of people were not happy about this, to say the least. And I'm not too, too surprised it's getting shelved. But again, yeah. If you want more details on what it was and how our team thought about it, definitely check out that episode that we will put in the link in the show notes. I want to give a quick shout out to Hexins as we explore today's blockchain landscape.
00:10:45.798 - 00:11:18.850, Speaker B: Let's take a moment to recognize them. As a premier cybersecurity provider in web3, Hexons is trusted by tier one projects like Polygon, including a security review on their new polygon, Zke, EVM, Mantle, Risk, zero, Lido, one inch, Newbank, and more. Get a deep dive into your technology stack with the most comprehensive analysis and cybersecurity consulting, hexons not only uses widely known methodologies and flows, but discovers and introduces new ones on a day to day basis. With over $55 billion secured, they cover everything from smart contracts to blockchain to web two pen tests.
00:11:19.530 - 00:11:45.994, Speaker A: Yeah, there's been nearly $7 billion of total value hacked in crypto's nascent history, so it's safe to say your team has a lot on the line. Don't skimp out. Take your security seriously and reach out to Hexans. Don't forget to mention zero x research for a free web two pen test with your partnership, and reach out to Hexans at Hexins IO. Find them in the links in the show notes, or reach out to them at permissionless. They'll be at booth 832. But without further ado, let's get back to today's episode.
00:11:46.042 - 00:12:39.598, Speaker B: The other big news was the blur fee switch proposal. And so this came out about midweek. Last week, Arca actually put a proposal forward in the Blur governance forums. Really just bringing about the point of a fee switch and their belief about why you could turn it on and how they think the best way about going and doing so would be. So when Blur originally launched, it had, like, an 180 day time frame before anyone could have a fee switch discussion, and that hasn't since passed by about a quarter or so. And so Arca's proposal stated a 1% base fee on all trading activity, but it also had this interesting tier system that would apply discounts to token holders that held x amount of tokens, basically, and all fees generated by this proposal would be used to buy back and then burn blur. And I got a lot of thoughts on this because it kind of asks you two questions.
00:12:39.598 - 00:13:29.678, Speaker B: One, should revenue be returned to token holders at this point in the blur protocol's life? And two, if yes, what should that look like? And so, first, my opinion is, no. Right now, revenue should not be used to be returned token holders because the token pit plays no role within Blur's function. You don't need to have the token today. And so because of that, it's just like this governance token, and that's fine. And when you return protocol revenue to the token, it's basically like a dividend, and dividends should be excess cash that the protocol does not need to continue growing its market share or building the best product. And for a product that's like 200 ish days old, that is absolutely not the case. It is not one, it is not the best NFT marketplace out there.
00:13:29.678 - 00:14:24.618, Speaker B: It still has a lot of work it needs to be doing. So I would like to see that revenue being recycled into the protocol to promote growth or build a new service product or hire some more engineers to go build X, Y and Z. There are so many other things that could be done with this money being generated that buying back and burning is not the answer here. And returning revenue to token holders is like just throwing it out the window in a lot of ways. And Arca cited the reason of why they wanted to see that, because Blur is now kind of teasing this end to season two trading rewards as November 20, and supposedly when November 20 hits, all these trading rewards that people have been earning over the last couple of months will now become liquid. And of course, there's really no use to holding the blur token today, right? It's just like a governance token that has governance rights over a protocol that has a very minimal governance. So it's like fairly a useless token.
00:14:24.618 - 00:14:34.290, Speaker B: And so they're trying to be like, all right, well, if it's a useless token, then let's give it revenue. But that doesn't, to me, seem like the best answer here. But curious if you guys have any thoughts on this proposal.
00:14:35.670 - 00:15:20.338, Speaker A: I think it's just not the right timing. I'm all for throwing on a fee switch at some point. I think it's just being forced because honestly, probably because the core contributors, investors and team allocations just hit their cliff and now they're vesting. So I'm sure they're kind of desperate to get some value. Cruel. And if you look at the X two, Y two, or looks token charts, the token incentives can only take you so far, especially as your token bleeds out towards zero and the value of those incentives gets less and less valuable over time. So I think the logic here is like, well, we'll still hand out these blur trading rewards, but if you want to keep farming in the future, then you have to actually hold the airdrop we give you in order to have free trading on the platform and continue to farm into the future.
00:15:20.338 - 00:15:49.318, Speaker A: So I guess it can remove some sell pressure and then I guess continually buying the token with trading fees could help that FDV and make the incentive and back of napkin math that people would then be kind of writing out in order to see, all right, should I even be wash trading here? Is it worth my time and the fees I'm paying versus what the value of the blur token is? So I see the logic. I just think the NFT market is still six to twelve months away from catching on to a new narrative.
00:15:49.414 - 00:16:26.630, Speaker D: I could also see why they want to do the fee burning thing, because that seems to be a good playbook to get your multiples higher or the market like, I don't know. It seems that a lot of market participants enjoy a fee burning mechanism even though it doesn't accrue real value that much. And maybe also trying to ride on that rollbit wave that has been going on lately where, okay, they do make a lot of revenue or do burn a lot of tokens, but kind of getting into a similar comp bucket with those protocols.
00:16:27.210 - 00:17:36.080, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good point, brick, because when I think about buyback and burn, it's pretty similar to, we see this a lot within the traditional equity markets, right? Like companies will repurchase shares of their stock and then that kind of gets equally allocated across all these shareholders. And that happens for one reason, and that's because traditional finance equity markets are fairly efficient for the most part, and especially when it comes to share repurchases, because you have this enterprise value that gets divided amongst the total number of shares, and the only thing that's changing in that calculation is the number of shares outstanding. So when that gets reduced, the value per share increases. And that tends to work quite well as this more tax efficient distribution of excess revenue to shareholders, because dividends count as income and share repurchases do not. It's just capital gains. But in crypto markets, you don't have agreed upon financial metrics and that everyone can has this model that's relatively agreed upon. Sure, maybe you don't totally agree on the long term growth drivers, but roughly you're going to get to the same number.
00:17:36.080 - 00:18:03.880, Speaker B: That's not the case in these markets. So when you do these share repurchases, just because the denominator is decreasing doesn't necessarily make the token value increase. So I don't know. I don't think share token buyback and burns are like the best way to redistribute wealth to token holders if you're going to do it. But at the end of the day, there is a narrative around it. Right? Brick, you mentioned rollbit, and I think that's a great example. They're really crushing it with their model.
00:18:04.650 - 00:18:53.510, Speaker C: I was going to say I also totally agree with Brick's take there, but the way you took it was like, okay, here's how this could bring a fundamental valuation to the blur token. And the way I took it was like it could fit into a narrative that's currently hot and popular among CT and investors in crypto, and who cares? I don't think blur is going to drive meaningful revenue to token holders, even if they turn on the fee switch, if they return to token holders. And that's two big ifs right there. But if they do both those things, I don't think they're returning meaningful value to token holders based on their valuation today. That said, it might fit into a narrative where there's a lot of new liquid funds who are probably looking for these protocols who have real yields. I know that's something that kind of is dying out compared to the narrative that existed a year ago. But at the same time, I do think that that is something that a lot of the newer investors and crypto people in the class of 2020 kind of look for.
00:18:53.510 - 00:18:59.810, Speaker C: So I think that it definitely does have some value just as far as getting back into the attention of the general public and things of that nature.
00:18:59.890 - 00:19:10.858, Speaker B: I got a question that I should probably know the answer to. So, Sam, I'm going to lean on you here for this one, but what percentage of market share does blur have relative to opensea these days?
00:19:10.944 - 00:20:04.958, Speaker A: I was actually looking at this the other day, but if you have like, Hildabi's wash filter on, which is actually a great little calculation that he personally made, and he's got it on dune, I highly recommend everyone checks it out. Maybe we can drop that in the show notes, but it's around like 50% to 65% depending on the given week. So they're definitely seeing more volume than OpenC still. But what's interesting is OpeNC still sees two to three times more uniquely active wallets really interacting with the protocol. So I think that just implies one, if someone's going to buy an NFT, like a retail person who's not super crypto native, they're going to Opensea, they're not going to blur yet. I think Opensea kind of has that uniswap brand, and then on top of that, I just think a lot of the volume, it's not technically wash trading and filtered out based on Hildabi's methodology, but it's impossible to detect because it's the blur token farming. That is definitely what's driving the revenue over there.
00:20:04.958 - 00:20:42.322, Speaker A: I personally think Blur is a better product and they've done some innovative stuff, obviously with blend, and I think they're continually going to push out new products and features. So I really don't think it's a terrible play if you're bullish on general purpose marketplaces. But I'm personally just super bearish that I don't understand why anyone who drops an NFT wouldn't want to have that royalty baked in income market fee income accrued to themselves. I think there will eventually be a shopify type platform that helps you really easily spin up an NFT marketplace, and that's what people will use because they're going to want that fee revenue.
00:20:42.386 - 00:20:47.034, Speaker C: Oh, that makes me want to skip over to one of my cool Thrones so bad, but I guess I'll just have to save it.
00:20:47.152 - 00:21:14.334, Speaker B: Patience, patience. All right, everyone, let's take a moment to hear about Metamask portfolio. If you're like me and Sam, managing your crypto assets across different wallets and networks can be so overwhelmingly complicated. That's why we're excited about metamask portfolio. All you have to do is connect your metamask wallet to get a bird's eye view of all your coins, tokens, and nfts in one place. You can easily buy, sell, swap, bridge, and stake crypto assets at competitive rates, all within the app. And you get to choose from a vetted list of providers.
00:21:14.334 - 00:21:24.534, Speaker B: There's no more jumping between dozens of sites and apps. Metamask portfolio lets you do more in web3 your way, giving you secure and convenient access to a wide range of features and services, all within one place.
00:21:24.652 - 00:21:31.290, Speaker A: Manage your portfolio your way with Metamask portfolio. Peep the link in the description of today's episode to get started.
00:21:31.360 - 00:21:54.622, Speaker B: Now pivot over to the arbitram stip recap to kind of walk through those short term incentive programs. And now that's closed. I know you and Brick both put a ton of effort into allocating out the blockworks research votes that we have as delegates, as well as kind of helping the community understand as well. You guys made a phenomenal Excel spreadsheet that kind of walked through and gave the highlights. So please take it away.
00:21:54.676 - 00:22:43.626, Speaker C: Brick Bacchio and I took a significant amount of time to look through 105 arbitrary proposals. I know it's been talked about just like short recap, 50 million arb is to be allocated to projects in the ecosystem who applied for grants? There was 105 applications and I believe something like I'll double check, but something around 30 actually ended up getting funded. A large portion of the 50 million got sent to GMX, which was 12 million tokens that will be returned to GMX stakers. Additionally, projects like Camelot Jones, Dow, Dopex, Pendle Radiant and plenty of others got funded. One interesting thing is that most of the projects that got funded had a lot of goodwill in the arbitrum ecosystem. So I think that that was a huge factor in delegates making a choice. While that was something we took into account, it was only one of the metrics.
00:22:43.626 - 00:23:34.414, Speaker C: So we looked at things like total fees accrued. What was the quality of the proposal? TvL depending on the different types of protocols, we bucketed into things like perps and lending and yield optimizers and then looked at different metrics for each individual category. But the projects that got funded, it seems that ecosystem goodwill, was it an OG project in the arbitram ecosystem that probably brought on a lot of these Defi dgens that helped make it the vibrant defi culture that exists over there today. And those are really what got funded. While most of these incentive programs haven't started yet, so it's hard to know exactly where the alpha will be, it is definitely worth keeping an eye on every project that got funded because there will be some good opportunities. These programs have to end by January 31, meaning that there should be about three months of incentives for each of these programs and there's a lot of r would be given out. Maybe we can put a link to the ones that were successfully funded in the show.
00:23:34.414 - 00:23:47.302, Speaker C: Notes that I'll pass on to you guys after this. The process was a bit of a shit show. As a delegate, it was very difficult to go through the 105 proposals. There's plenty of things wrong with it. But Brick, I'd love to get your take on what are you think about the whole process.
00:23:47.436 - 00:25:14.990, Speaker D: Main takeaway was that it's still kind of hard to, or I guess it's been talked about a lot, but dows still seems super inefficient and it seems that there hasn't been yet a solution that solves for all the problems. And I feel that one of the main catalysts for the messiness of dows, if you can use that word, is that there's just like too many people who are trying to participate in the whole process. And yeah, I thought about this a lot after the whole steep proposal process, and I feel that one mechanism or implementation I would like to see more of is that you kind of elect a board of delegates, if you will, who make most of the decisions for the DAO. And the DAO can propose stuff to them, and then they make the decisions. And if the DAO disagrees, they can vote against those decisions. And if somebody on the board misbehaves, they can also be thrown out and replaced, which I feel that that would be kind of like taking the best parts that we've learned from tradfi or corporate finance, and then putting some more transparency in that process and also making sure that everybody who votes is super knowledgeable. But then if they misbehave, they can also be punished.
00:25:14.990 - 00:25:22.210, Speaker D: But I don't know if that's probably easier said than done. So would be interesting to hear in your takes or if you disagree.
00:25:23.190 - 00:26:08.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I have two takeaways from kind of what you just said, which is one, I think the biggest issue dows face today is that there aren't enough professional operators in, you know, mostly people who are big personalities on Twitter. Maybe an airdrop threader who helps a lot of people get tokens gets delegated, a bunch of tokens or something like that. And while it's totally fine, maybe more technical entities and entities who are really involved, like maybe, I don't know, smart contract auditors or things of that nature, would be the best delegates. Or there's plenty of examples, these professional operators who would be really good. So it's like, how do you incentivize them to get involved? And how do you get people to delegate that group or those entities, your tokens? And then the second thing is like, why do daos exist in the first place? Right. To some extent for not all daos. I think arbitram is an example of a dow that is needed.
00:26:08.514 - 00:26:36.570, Speaker C: It controls pretty much everything involved in the protocol. There is a security council, but overall, the DAO has a ton of power. But other dows, like blur, uniswap, these are dows that don't really do much at the end of the day. They probably exist as a form of regulatory arbitrage, so that the token is maybe not considered a security under the Howie test, depending on. I don't even know what I'm talking about there, but I think that that's probably a big portion of why dows exist. Yeah, it's tough.
00:26:37.150 - 00:27:09.066, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, those are all good points, I think. And it's like, there's a couple of dows that have really gone the service provider route, if you will. Like, Ave is the first one that comes to mind. Avang compound are like the first ones to really use gauntlet at scale, if I'm thinking correctly here. And they have this huge problem of asset listing. Risk management is like a very specialized task that requires some pretty in depth knowledge of not only the protocol, but risk as a whole. And that's like something that's just not fit for token holders, in my opinion.
00:27:09.066 - 00:27:47.860, Speaker B: And so they kind of see that as well. Like, all right, we're going to use a service provider to make recommendations to the token holders so at least they're making informed decisions. And in the Ave V three build, there's like these things called guardians that have even further controls. You can elect a multi sig to make certain decisions that are like, you can do things within a banded range, basically, so you don't have full permissions over what can and can't be done. But all right, we'll give you the ability to change the parameters from x to z or something of this nature. And they're kind of like moving away from everything needs to be a token decision, a token holder decision. In a lot of ways, I think that makes a lot of sense.
00:27:47.860 - 00:28:28.282, Speaker B: Again, if there needs to be a quick parameter change, that shouldn't be a seven day vote for everyone to participate in. That should just be the risk advisor's decision. And then when you really start playing that out, brick, to your point, that kind of does start looking like this board of directors thing where you have somebody who's overseeing a risk head know, maybe they appoint a couple people to own a certain groups of assets and then the Dow has like full veto. You know, we just had an interview with Sam Kazimian and that'll actually be coming out on Thursday. So the day after this episode airs. And we talked a little bit mostly about their new updates. One thing that did come up was the Fracs Gov module, which is kind of very similar to what we just described.
00:28:28.282 - 00:29:08.202, Speaker B: And instead of giving an elected group of people, it's just the core team. Because today, if you know anything about fracs, like multisigs have full control over the protocol, and that is something they know and something they're trying to build towards to remove. And this is what the module does. So basically, TLDR is the core team can do anything, and then there's like a two day time delay where the token holders can veto. And so this kind of gives the core team the ability to continue operating the protocol with a slight delay, but kind of takes the rugginess, if you will, out of it. Right? So if they were going to say, hey, we're going to completely drain the protocol. Token holders can vote against that and prevent that from happening.
00:29:08.202 - 00:29:48.870, Speaker B: And so they're kind of exploring their own route of like, where is this line between giving professional operators, core team members, service providers, whatever you want to call them, giving that group of professional entity control to operate the protocol, but still keeping it in this permissionless, decentralized manner? It's like a very hard line to find, and we're going to need rapid experimentation to figure that out. So kudos to the Fracs team for doing what they're doing. Ave again has really pushed forward this service provider route. I want to see even more and more of this. Makerdao is going like subdows. The Cosmos hub has talked about subdows in their own, like, there's a lot of new things happening.
00:29:48.940 - 00:30:00.502, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. We definitely need a lot more experimentation on the governance layer. I feel like we're barely in the first inning right now. It's almost like pregame warm ups, but that's kind of just the current state of Dow governance.
00:30:00.646 - 00:30:13.006, Speaker B: Were there any big misses on protocols that you'd expect to get funded that weren't? I know Lida was very close on the edge. I don't actually know where that one ended up. I saw curve did not get funded, but curious if there's any more.
00:30:13.188 - 00:30:44.650, Speaker A: I know gains network didn't and I found that a bit shocking, actually. I mean, I know they're polygon native and they migrated just maybe like eight months ago, nine months ago at the beginning of the year, I think it was January, so they didn't get funded. But the ask was quite a lot. It was like 7 million. And I know they tried to ratify the amount down to four and a half million, but by that point the proposal had already been submitted. So they were like, okay, we'll just get the 7 million, then we'll return two and a half million after the three months or whatever to the dow. So that was just kind of janky.
00:30:44.650 - 00:31:07.202, Speaker A: And then at the same time, I think you had mucks protocol get funded. So they are a perps aggregator and a lot of the volume actually goes through gains. So some people are probably thinking, well, if Mux got it, then gains will see increased volume. So that's like kind of quasi allocating to gains. So I don't know, that one was like a pretty tough one. I'm personally a fan of gains network, so I'm a little bit biased. I would have liked to have seen that one pass.
00:31:07.202 - 00:31:14.660, Speaker A: But it's just tough for these delegates. You've only got so many votes, there's only so much arb to go around. It's like you can't really please everyone.
00:31:15.590 - 00:31:38.954, Speaker C: Yeah, I think with gains, it was just that the request was too high. At 7 million, they were the second highest request after GMX. And I think a lot of delegates just looked at that as a bit excessive for like a polygon native perps platform. If you give GMX and gains and Mux, those three allocations alone would be somewhere in the range of. It would be 25 million arb. That's half the allocation to three perps protocols. It's just hard at that point.
00:31:38.954 - 00:32:13.686, Speaker C: And I think that ecosystem goodwill that I was talking about, that GMX has, means that they probably were pretty much guaranteed to get funded, no matter what they might have been. Like the fourth or fifth highest supported protocol or the application. Lido was one of the most interesting ones. Lido had a heck of a lot of votes overall. I think it had one of the highest voter turnouts, but it was super close in yes and no votes with a ton of abstains as way. I think the way the blockworks research looked at Lido was that it was a great proposal. But the problem was that Lido hadn't done so much in the arbitrum ecosystem yet.
00:32:13.686 - 00:33:12.134, Speaker C: As well as giving Lido a leg up in the kind of lsd market, share of arbitrum was maybe a bad look, versus kind of funding more of a holistic proposal that would get more lsds in general onboarded. So something that allowed Fracs and Lido and rocket pool and maybe even other lsds to come on and kind of create this whole vibrant ecosystem of lsts on arbitrum that doesn't exist today. Outside of that, I think that a lot of people are probably disappointed that Ramsays didn't get funded. That was like some $10 million markup coin that forexed or something like that, before the stips went up. Wormhole and Stargate did not get funded, which is an interesting one. And finally, curve, like you said, and Iraqis both did not get funded as well, which I think were a little bit surprising to some people. I really do think delegates kind of just chose the protocols that helped onboard the most users to arbitram thus far, and had quality proposals.
00:33:12.134 - 00:33:19.366, Speaker C: But I think that the first point there is really what delegates probably hammered down on. It seems to me I'm actually shocked.
00:33:19.398 - 00:33:25.200, Speaker A: That neither of the bridges got any allies. Do you know why that is or how far off they were.
00:33:26.610 - 00:33:50.182, Speaker C: Sorry, I actually misspoke. Stargate did get funded, and it was just wormhole that did not get funded. Not sure why. Know, from my point of view, I actually really liked wormhole's proposal. I don't exactly know what the take was there. Keeping in mind sometimes some of it has to do with even just the reputability among delegates. Like maybe Stargate has a good relationship with some of the bigger delegates or something like that.
00:33:50.182 - 00:33:55.880, Speaker C: We chose to vote for wormhole and against Stargate, but yeah, hard to know exactly.
00:33:56.490 - 00:34:07.980, Speaker B: Now I know I'm just throwing like random names of the 105 at you. So curious if, you know, if synapse got the allocation that they asked for just because they were kind of in that bridge category as well.
00:34:09.470 - 00:34:48.130, Speaker C: Synapse was very close, but did not get funded. Yeah, they're very close. We were not able to vote for them just because we decided that we were only going to support 50 million arbitran proposals total. But overall, synapse is a great protocol that probably has onboarded a lot of users into arbitrum before. If I remember correctly. From my point of view, their proposal more so was beneficial to lps on synapse than it was kind of to the arbitrum ecosystem, in that it didn't really incentivize a lot of sticky liquidity to come into bridge into arbitrum, but rather just to provide liquidity to synopsis protocol for bridging into arbitrum.
00:34:48.290 - 00:35:05.040, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought the wormhole one was pretty cool for achieving kind of exactly what you just described, where they're trying to bring USDC through wormhole into arbitrum, and then we're going to basically incentivize that the USDC stays on arbitrum, which I thought was pretty cool.
00:35:06.530 - 00:35:40.490, Speaker A: Yeah, native USDC too, because you've got the USDC e and then you've know, native USDC, it's just kind of a bitch of a ux. And really nothing that got passed really addressed that directly. I would have liked to have seen something around that. Maybe there's room for one of those bridges to actually submit a proposal outside of the actual step program that's a little bit more targeted and that draws a little bit more user mind share or voter mind share, I should say, because I just think it was really difficult for all these delegates to go through all these proposals, and everyone's got friends places, so everyone's asking you. And it just turns out to be a huge pain in the ass.
00:35:40.640 - 00:35:49.942, Speaker B: That'd actually be a cool one. It's something to incentivize swapping USDCe for native USDC and kind of trying to deprecate the USDCE.
00:35:50.086 - 00:36:02.462, Speaker C: I think Gauntlet's working on some mechanism designs to help with that process and make it a little bit easier. Ux, I think maybe they're working with the foundation or off chain labs or maybe the Dow. I'm not sure exactly who, but they are working on that.
00:36:02.516 - 00:36:02.686, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:02.708 - 00:36:36.822, Speaker A: I actually had an observation on the perp stuff. It's kind of interesting that DyDx V four is really soon, assuming within the next week or two, I would guess from what people are saying. But the fact that they want to do $20 million of incentives, roughly like 10 million tokens, and then at the same time, arbitrum just gave out roughly the same dollar value to perps platforms in its ecosystem, it'll be kind of funny to watch who kind of wins that battle right there. You got to think that probably it's the same 100 users watching on every single one, but I don't know, I'd like to try and be a little more optimistic.
00:36:36.886 - 00:36:37.114, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:37.152 - 00:36:40.250, Speaker B: Why don't you kick us off with a little hot seat, cool throne?
00:36:40.750 - 00:36:41.194, Speaker A: All right.
00:36:41.232 - 00:36:41.434, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:41.472 - 00:37:19.862, Speaker A: I actually have, like, small cap LST protocols in the cool throne could have put Lido in the hot seat. Either one worked. We just kind of try and get two hot seats and shoot cool throne. So that's how the math checked out. But basically, Lido voted, the Dow voted to sunset St. Soul because I guess the core contributors needed one and a half million to basically continue building that out and to allocate for incentives to actually stand a chance at competing, especially with everything going on in Solana with jeto, Soul and the point system and margin Phi and pretty much everyone who's on Salana is farming those points. So I think the Dow is just like, you know what? We kind of lost that market.
00:37:19.862 - 00:37:58.582, Speaker A: Let's just cut our losses. And I guess it's going to be like one hundred k to sunset the protocol over the next year. I think this is really a big win for smaller LST providers in the salana ecosystem. So, like, Marinade and Jito, but then also just bullish momentum for stride as an independent protocol with what we talked about in the governance updates. And honestly, Lido just really not being able to crack into other ecosystems. And then at the same time, you've got diva trying to vampire attack Lido. If you guys haven't checked out that one, I'd look into that and then you also have the Ethereum foundation posting research on how it's pretty bad that Lido is getting up there in market share.
00:37:58.582 - 00:38:24.826, Speaker A: So even in its own market, where it's from, it's still struggling to kind of keep a hold of the narrative. And then if you just look at the numbers now, you've got lido at a $1.4 billion market cap. They have like $14 billion of east staked at a four and a half percent yield. So that's like 630,000,000 or so a year. But 90% of that goes to the people who deposit. 5% goes to the Dow and then 5% goes to the no operators.
00:38:24.826 - 00:39:00.234, Speaker A: So that's really only $30 million or so of revenue. And if you just kind of look at the multiples on that, it doesn't look super attractive. It's like at this rate, you really are kind of near the upper bound in terms of what market share you can get of staked ETh. And then at the same time, you just need the ETH price to go up to make your earnings go up. It's like, why wouldn't you just buy ETh? In my opinion. But yeah, I'm curious if you guys have any thoughts on this proposal. And just as like a PSA, if you have any St Sol, you'll have until February to withdraw that deposit, because that's when they're sunsetting the UI as well.
00:39:00.352 - 00:39:28.378, Speaker D: I've got some thoughts on the valuation because I think there's still a lot of value in having governance rights over the whole protocol. I could see why that could carry a premium, let's say in four or five years. You want to propose something that's a bit controversial and you're a big holder, then I could see why holding a lot of the governance token would be valuable, even though it wouldn't accrue real revenue in that way.
00:39:28.484 - 00:40:49.078, Speaker B: You do have this added layer of like, yes, you get cash flows, but you also get control as well. I think that's kind of hard to price in, but it'll be interesting to watch that play out. And Sam, to your point about how this kind of impacts the goals or the mission of, like, they do seem like super EtH aligned now, which is interesting because the alignment folks are coming after them. And so maybe this is their response to that of like, hey, if you want us to be more aligned, we'll start backing out of other ecosystems and things of that nature. Which is kind of interesting because I think it was Monet supply, actually tweeted this, but when they announced that they were going to unwind their stake soul initiative, it's like, couldn't you have tried to sell that off to another provider or something that has value of all these staked tokens? And, I don't know, just kind of giving it up and be like, yeah, we're going to unwind it, unstake, and we're going to kind of forget it ever existed is kind of a weird business decision, in my opinion, there. And even if you didn't like the service provider you were using to kind of run that operation, well, why don't you vote to boot them out and replace them with somebody else? There seemed like a lot of options here, so that's why it kind of makes me think it's more of this alignment thing. So there's been a lot of talk about the lido moving into the cosmos and how it's going to affect Stride's business model and how it's going to bring another version of staked assets across the cosmos ecosystem.
00:40:49.078 - 00:41:08.180, Speaker B: But now you got to wonder, is that still on the table? Is that still what they're trying to do? Or are they really just going to be like, hey, it makes enough sense for us to just worry about Ethereum because we have such a large stake of the network. Let's go all in on that and kind of again, bring this counter thesis to the alignment crowd. Maybe if we can appease them, they won't try to kill us.
00:41:09.030 - 00:41:38.778, Speaker C: I just want to bring up another. So I totally agree with the take that I'm now super way more bullish Jito and stride than I was this morning. I actually went into my cosmos abyss Kepler wallet today to see if I had any funds that I could move into stride. I did tried to buy some and then realized that even, like, I think the 2% depth on there is like $1,000, which is just absurd. So I can like the protocol and be bullish, but still not be able to get exposure to the token, unfortunately. But Gdo soul is another cool one to keep an eye on as well.
00:41:38.944 - 00:41:44.986, Speaker B: I have the strides. Coin gecko page pulled up already and it's literally $5,000. That's insane.
00:41:45.178 - 00:42:27.686, Speaker C: Ridiculous. Another cool thing, the Lido governance proposal. Recently, last week. So I just came out with a report on DVT and the DVT landscape, and I came across this brand new Lido proposal from about a week ago, which is that the proposal states that they're going to attempt, if it passes, to make a small module. So a small allocation of lido, of Lido staked ETH that will go to DVT solutions ssv. And, you know, does this really solve the problem of lido having a huge market share and kind of having a significant control of the Ethereum ecosystem? That actually does present some vulnerabilities to Ethereum, given that 33% is an important metric for chain halts. But that said, you can split it across with oball and ssv.
00:42:27.686 - 00:42:37.598, Speaker C: You can split that stake across way more than the 31 node operators that they have today. So it is better and step in the right direction and hopefully we see that pass.
00:42:37.684 - 00:43:10.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been hearing all about DVT for like a year and a half, and this is the first time I've actually seen a little bit more action. It feels like it's actually starting to come to life and it's been in the works for so long. So super excited to see how that pans out. And I know, yeah, that report that you wrote, matt, was really good. If you're a blockwork sub, you should definitely check that out. But brick, I did want to come back to your comment just real quick before we move. Like, why do you think the governance rights would demand a premium? I just don't even see, like, if you're just going to stay ETH alliance, stay in the ETH, like, you're still kind of capped at your market share potential.
00:43:10.690 - 00:43:19.370, Speaker A: Yes, the market cap of ETH can grow as well as the total amount of ETH staked, but I don't really know if that demands a multibillion dollar premium.
00:43:20.370 - 00:43:47.620, Speaker D: The way I see it is that it's such an important protocol for the chain that it should get a higher valuation for the governance rights. Or let's compare it to some perfs protocol. Even if you would get a lot of voting power on those protocols, your impact on the whole ecosystem won't be as high at the end of the day. So I kind of want to put a premium on that.
00:43:48.570 - 00:43:49.814, Speaker B: Let's play that out, though.
00:43:49.852 - 00:43:50.102, Speaker C: Okay?
00:43:50.156 - 00:44:35.460, Speaker B: Because eth, the token doesn't control the Ethereum network, it's strictly the nodes. And so if I have a bunch of LDO tokens and I can push a governance proposal through Lido, what am I even capable of doing would be what I would need to play out. I feel like, don't you just have control over maybe, let's say the staking router is live and maybe you can vote what percentage of stake is run by the professional operators versus maybe the DVT operators versus maybe some other piece that gets added onto the staking router. If I wanted to push a controversial EIP through the network, could I use my LDO tokens to kind of do that?
00:44:36.630 - 00:45:16.430, Speaker D: Well, how would I put it? Like the constraint or the equation I'd use there is like how much would I have to pay in LDO to, for example, capture a large market share by pushing out a proposal that says that, okay, all of the stake goes to a few of my own nodes, and by that way start controlling the whole network against trying to somehow maliciously attack the ethereum chain itself. And then if you put together those two constraints, I feel that it's cheaper to start acquiring Lido. Or that's why I feel that it should have kind of a governance premium.
00:45:17.090 - 00:45:52.014, Speaker C: Cue that it's all social consensus conversation and just end it right there. No, I'm kidding. But yeah, it's an interesting concept, right? Because no, controlling 51% of ethereum validators does not mean that you get to decide what's the canonical Ethereum chain. At the end of the day, it's Ethereum token holder. It's a combination of all the participants in the Ethereum ecosystem that decide that. But if there was like a controversial EIP or something like that, there is a significant power in controlling 33% of Ethereum stake in order to have sway over the clients in order to get them to implement what you want. I can't think of a good example of that might be, but there is some value there.
00:45:52.014 - 00:45:56.542, Speaker C: I don't know how to value it, but I don't know how to quantify it. But there definitely is some value there.
00:45:56.596 - 00:46:02.910, Speaker A: All right, enough lido. I'm honestly tired of hearing myself talk about it, so I'm going to kick it over. Break. You got a hot seat or cool throw this week?
00:46:02.980 - 00:47:09.446, Speaker D: Hot seat for this week. I've been seeing a lot of link marines on Twitter getting super heated about people who are saying that CCIP hasn't been that successful yet and it's still unclear whether they're going to become a market leader. Yeah, I get that. CCIP has a lot of super good partnerships and especially on the tradfine, I don't know, real world side, but at the end of the day, it's not still crystal clear that they're going to take over the whole market and especially like, okay, I guess they're still in kind of a testing phase, but it's cool that they have like 80 plus on chain partners. But it seems that at the moment there's no on chain dj and demand for the cross chain protocol. Everybody just thinking about what's the cheapest way to do it and what's the fastest way to transfer assets, for example, between chains. But yeah, I could totally see the long term thesis as well.
00:47:09.446 - 00:47:33.630, Speaker D: Or I'm not saying that it's not possible for it to happen, but I'm also saying that there's still a lot of risk in the whole CCIP thesis of it taking over all cross chain transactions and getting all the RWA transactions coming from legacy systems to banks private chains.
00:47:35.330 - 00:48:21.440, Speaker B: Is that the core use of it, though, is like the RWA side? Because I honestly don't know that much about CCIP, but when I'm thinking about bridging, to be honest, I just kind of use whatever is the most convenient to me because I never really find that one bridge is extremely cheaper than the other. Matt, you brought to my attention that going l one to l two, you should just use the native bridge. But going l two to l one is when you can get cost savings and time savings, and it's like, okay, but still, even if it is, like, if I'm paying $5 on bridge a and $3 on bridge b, I'm not going to pick bridge a or b because of the price. I'm going to just pick which one I'm more comfortable using. I don't know.
00:48:22.130 - 00:49:06.726, Speaker D: I mean, Chainlink's whole thesis is that they're going to bring all institutions on chain, so to say, and that's where the large tam is located. Or like, yeah, it's nice if you can get individual investors using your protocol as well, but if all institutions adapt your mechanism or your protocol, your market is going to be so much larger than on the individual side. And the largest selling point for them is getting these tokenized real world assets on chain and banks pushing them on their or true CCIP on chain.
00:49:06.918 - 00:49:35.810, Speaker C: That gives me so many memories back to the OG ripple XRP. Like, all the banks are going to use ripple to settle the fiat to fiat transactions cross bank. And I was like, that makes so much sense when I was a 16 year old kid. But yeah, we saw how that played out. And maybe it's hot take or bit controversial, but I doubt we see banks do it. Okay, if you want information passed from ethereum to your private blockchain, you're going to do that yourself. Probably vice versa, too.
00:49:35.810 - 00:50:16.006, Speaker C: Why rely on Chainlink to do that? Maybe I'm just misunderstanding. I haven't looked into CCIP so much and then additionally, the whole real world assets narrative that's been gaining so much steam, it's like, I'll buy the narrative. I think that it's something that's going to continue to gain steam. I want to make some money on it, but I don't buy it as, like, this huge fundamental value proposition for crypto. At the end of the day, things that are governed in the real world, not that they don't belong on chain, they do. I think that there is definitely value in having stablecoins and having treasury yields on chain, but at the same time, it can't be our fundamental value proposition. It can't be our zero to one moment, because it's too easy for these entities that actually govern the assets.
00:50:16.006 - 00:50:55.454, Speaker C: For instance, the US government as it comes to us dollars and stablecoins, or the bank itself, whoever's issuing a bond, whatever the corporation issuing a bond, or the regulatory bodies who are regulating said assets have too much ability to just control it and move it off of Ethereum, move it to their own private blockchain. At the end of the day, what Ethereum and other, what blockchains do is they remove trust assumptions. They minimize trust assumptions, but they also do add some cost and add some complexity and friction. And it's like taking these things that already exist in the real world and work totally fine and adding cost and friction. I don't know if I see it as a huge value proposition, but I know that's definitely a hot.
00:50:55.492 - 00:51:34.666, Speaker A: Take one comment real quick before we get super deep into the real world asset combo, because I could just tell Brick's got something to say. But I did see Sergey speak at a Goldman Sachs crypto event last Thursday, and I had never actually listened to him talk, so that's kind of embarrassing. Just on. .1 but he was a really impressive guy, super smart. And I would have thought, like, a week ago before that, if you would have told me, oh, yeah, CCIP is going to be linking all these banks private chains together. I would have laughed you out the room, Brick, but I literally saw this guy having handshakes with every banker in the room, and he got invited to this event, and he was literally calling it the Internet of.
00:51:34.666 - 00:52:00.050, Speaker A: And, like, people were talking about the fact that, oh, great, we finally tokenized a bond on this private blockchain. But there's no users, zero liquidity. There's zero use. It's just there. So I think if Sergey is working with some of these banks and they understand the problem, as I just saw that, okay, we have this tokenized thing, but we don't know what the hell to do with it. And he's the guy who's talking with them, and that's the new chain link vision. I think that's kind of bullish.
00:52:01.030 - 00:52:57.958, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with that. But I also feel that sometimes they kind of oversell the whole idea and then don't talk about the downsides or possible risks there. It's more like, you see these marines going in on Twitter and being like, okay, we already won. We have these partnerships with, let's say, swift and big australian banks or whatever, but at the end of the day, they're just like, in a test phase right now. And you could well have somebody else who comes in, let's say, like, to Matt's point, some government entity or somebody already super in the tradfi world and just take over the market from there. So I kind of believe in the vision, and I think Chainlink has a really good business development team and a good marketing team and has been able to create super nice partnerships. But I'd still say that it's not like 100% there or it's not a done deal.
00:52:57.958 - 00:53:04.710, Speaker D: I got to see some transactions on that chain before I believe it myself or on that bridging protocol.
00:53:05.130 - 00:53:39.074, Speaker B: Those are fair points, brick, for sure. But, Matt, I'm definitely ready to derail this conversation with you and argue about the efficacy of real world assets as a whole. And actually, I don't think we disagree that much. So my framework for all of this is blockchains as a whole are creating this new digital first economy. Each l one is kind of its own little silo within this larger crypto economy. And within that, you have different sectors, right? Like, gaming is becoming increasingly popular. NFTs are their own little bubble in there as well.
00:53:39.074 - 00:54:29.934, Speaker B: We're seeing things like social apps kind of come online and with the rise of things like friendtech and post tech and what was stars arena for about an hour and a half. And there's obviously the other big bubble, and that's Defi. And within zooming into just deFi, within the broader crypto economy, we have this very nascent, very small, but very powerful financialized micro economy. And so what we're doing right now is ETh has become this Internet native money, and we've kind of created a financial market around that. And again, each l one kind of has done this with its own base token, but we're still this super small economy that doesn't have. We have our own native yields and things like that with the eth staking rate and things of this nature. But we are still this super small economy.
00:54:29.934 - 00:55:32.642, Speaker B: And so when we import things like the Iorb rate that Frax is doing with Sfrax or some of this treasury yield that SDI is doing, quite similarly, through Makerdao, we are importing these off chain yields on chain and powering our little micro crypto economy with these very important rates. And that is very exciting to me. I think that is a bit of a superpower, because now when we're in these turndowns and things like us, treasuries get much more exciting. You might not necessarily need to go off chain to access those yields. So if we rewind to peak of the 2021 bull run, when things started to go bad and they were like hiking, let's say we rewind to when the rate hike started. If you were doing some leveraged ETH staking yield trade, and you're like, I need to take this trade off and go kind of start allocating into some treasuries. To do that, you had to sell your ETH, go to coinbase or your service provider, and basically turn it back into dollars and then buy treasuries.
00:55:32.642 - 00:56:18.760, Speaker B: Now you can unwind that trade and then just buy SDI or buy Sfrax or buy one of these on chain treasury products that are coming online with things like Ondo finance. Now you have the ability to stay within your little micro economy and access these more off chain esque yields, and it's a different risk profile, but within this one little bubble, you can now do more. And to me, that's super exciting. And why I don't think we disagree with that is, a, I don't think you disagree with anything I just said, but b, one of the things you mentioned was like, that shouldn't be our zero to one, and I agree with that. I want to see continued innovation within the defi space, but importing these yields is still super important to supercharging growth. And that's why I'm still very excited about this.
00:56:19.610 - 00:56:55.066, Speaker C: I think I agree with everything you said. One thing that comes to mind is that I think I would rather own treasury bonds than own ando treasury bonds. I think that there are trust assumptions that probably aren't risk assumptions that probably aren't so realized. I love fracs, I'm a huge fan. But there's probably definitely some risk assumptions involved in owning Sfrax versus the treasury bonds itself. And maybe it's going to take me five or seven days or something to turn my eth into dollars or whatever into treasury bonds. But yeah, I think I would just rather do that from a risk assumption perspective.
00:56:55.066 - 00:57:30.794, Speaker C: I understand there's some value in foreigners being able to access these assets that might be harder, that might have a high barrier to entry for them today. But at the same time, I don't think that's again like a huge long term value proposition, rather just something that is kind of small and helpful. But I agree with everything you said. Crypto uniswap is awesome. Ave is awesome. We have great products and we still exist in this little bit of a looking for a nicer way to say it than this defi circle jerk where it's all just like crypto tokens and kind of clownery. But I can go ahead and give my hot seat if we're ready.
00:57:30.992 - 00:57:32.634, Speaker B: Yeah, go far away.
00:57:32.832 - 00:58:09.560, Speaker C: My hot seat today is going to be the uniswap hook haters. So there's been this huge rhetoric on Twitter over the last week or so that uniswap is now uniswap V four is going to be a Kyc platform. People are just like going off about how it's horrible, but I just want to mention that this is something that was nitpicked from a public. So basically, okay, uniswap V four, you can do this thing called creating hooks. Hooks are basically customizable pools that allow for more complex actions upon swaps. So you can do things like Mev rebates where you return Mev that was extracted to the traders. You can do things like add royalties back into.
00:58:09.560 - 00:58:44.210, Speaker C: So like, that's awesome, right? I think that's something that's super cool that people hadn't really realized could be enabled in a ton more things. But one thing also that you can enable with the hook is KYC compliance. So you could only allow traders who have fulfilled the KYC in order to trade in the pool, which is actually pretty cool because maybe there's going to be things like these ondo finance tokens where they need to be able to do that in order to be listed on Uniswap, or they won't be able to. I don't know. That's just one example. But at the same time, it's an optional thing that pool creators can implement that is in no way enshrined in the protocol. It was created by a community participant at a hackathon, not uniswap labs or anything like that.
00:58:44.210 - 00:59:05.820, Speaker C: And it's just ridiculous to see this huge rhetoric that uniswap v four is going to be KYC compliant. Blah blah blah blah. Like complete shenanigans and made up hoax are absolutely awesome. There's about 80 listed on this site, uniswapholks.com. Some of them are ridiculously cool. And this has only been being worked on for two months, if that. So it'll be interesting to see as more come to market.
00:59:07.710 - 00:59:21.200, Speaker A: Genuine question, like, why do people give a shit if something's KYC? They had to KYC to get money into crypto at some point, right? And they have to KYC at some point to get money out of crypto at another point. So I just don't understand what the big deal is.
00:59:24.610 - 00:59:30.978, Speaker B: Yeah, people want permissionless systems. That was like the first promise of deFi, but. Sorry, Matt, I'll let you take it from here.
00:59:31.064 - 00:59:33.250, Speaker C: No, you go ahead. I was going to say the same thing.
00:59:33.400 - 00:59:47.078, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you guys. I get that that's what they want. But this is just one option. You don't have to use it if you don't want to, but it's nice to have people that can use it if that's a rule that you have to follow.
00:59:47.244 - 01:00:17.170, Speaker B: Right. I think that's what got blown out of proportion here was like, this is a hook in the arsenal of hooks, and you don't need to launch a pool that has this hook. Now it'll be interesting to see what the adoption rate of this hook is. Right. If 98% of all Uniswap V four pools use this hook, then, no, it's not enshrined in the protocol, but everybody's doing it anyways. That's kind of like saying, yeah, well, Mevboost isn't enshrined in the protocol, but 92% of blocks are made with Mevboost.
01:00:18.390 - 01:01:25.106, Speaker C: Fully agreed. And the Chris Black comment, who's like leading this whole charge of uniswaps going KYC compliant or whatever. I think probably if he was on this podcast, what he might say, and I don't want to put words in his mouth, probably what he would say is that if the majority of liquidity goes to these KYC compliant pools, which not only is feasible, but maybe in some people's heads, is likely, because you could have banks and industry participants who are otherwise not able to go into these pools because they might be facilitating in some world, they might have this risk where they would be regulated for facilitating if traders are doing illegal things, like maybe they would get in trouble for, quote unquote, facilitating it by being the counterparty to those trades. So people like that might go put money into these pools if they have a higher TVL. If the ETH USDC pool that is KYC compliant has a far higher TVL than the non KYC compliant one, obviously traders are going to want to route through there. So even if it's not enshrined, but this is just a potential future. And at the end of the day, if that's what industry participants and the money wants, that's okay, as long as there's the option for non KYC compliance and the pool still exists.
01:01:25.106 - 01:01:34.102, Speaker C: I think in my head, where the money goes, cool, I'll support it. Even though I don't support. I want to see permissionless systems. I also want to see crypto succeed.
01:01:34.246 - 01:02:26.730, Speaker B: I mean, hold on, pulling out the tinfoil hat here. Uniswap V four kind of adapts on the v three model, where it's like complex lps will outperform, just like you and me lping into a pool. And so if you play that out, these professional lps that use really high complexity based systems to manage their positions, they are likely large us based entities that do care about what these KYC rules have to say. And so what's the likelihood that those pools are the ones that do get the liquidity? And to me, it kind of seems quite high. I would not be shocked at all if, say, some 90% of the liquidity flows to KYC hook approved pools. To me, that is very much a non zero outcome.
01:02:27.070 - 01:02:36.590, Speaker A: I agree with you, but I think that's in, like, four or five years. I don't think any legitimate banking institution is anywhere close to making swaps on uniswap, like in a live.
01:02:36.660 - 01:02:43.050, Speaker B: Right, but who are the lps today, and do those people care? Is the question. And I got a feeling the answer is yes.
01:02:43.220 - 01:02:45.780, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that's fair. That's a good point.
01:02:49.270 - 01:03:21.158, Speaker C: This will be the conversation. And it's not just about uniswap, right? We likely will have l two s that you need to KYC in order to bridge over to. We are going to see this play out. We're going to see validators who are only willing to propose blocks that are from censored relays. At the end of the day, even though I have strong opinions about what I want, it's where the money goes, and that is how it should be. So it's like this truly lazy fair market, and that's crypto.
01:03:21.254 - 01:03:35.054, Speaker A: I think that's a good spot to end it. Honestly, this has been a really fun conversation. Brick appreciate you coming on for your debut. I'm sure the audience will get more of you. Got any closing for having me? There we go. I love it, Matt. Thanks too.
01:03:35.054 - 01:03:39.500, Speaker A: I appreciate you guys taking an hour out of the day, but, yeah, I guess we'll do this again next week.
