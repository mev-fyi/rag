00:00:00.440 - 00:00:41.714, Speaker A: Okay. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Frontiers in quantitative Finance seminar. This seminar is brought to you by the Oxford Mathematical and Computational Finance Group. And on behalf of my colleagues from Oxford, we are very pleased to welcome you here. And the seminar is supported by the Citigroup, who provides this nice venue and mosaic smart data and provides financial support for the seminar. So today we're very happy to have Professor Olivier Guerrero as our speaker. Olivier is well known to many of you, especially those who are interested in market microstructure and optimal execution.
00:00:41.714 - 00:01:24.244, Speaker A: He has a lot of research work in this area and a very nice book. Olivier started his career with a PhD in applied mathematics with the fields benelist Pierre Louis Leonz as his advisor. I believe his PhD was the first on the application of mean field games to economics and finance. That was the goal, I guess. So. That was the early days where Pierre Lunion had developed this theory of mean field gains, and he tasked Olivier with finding applications to economics. I think you tried to apply this to oil markets, something like that.
00:01:24.284 - 00:01:24.868, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:25.036 - 00:02:17.468, Speaker A: Okay, very tough topic. And, you know, some people, like Leon, have very strong scientific personalities, and once you get into their orbit, you can hardly get out. But interestingly, Olivier did not stay in the orbit. He developed a very original style in his research, and he did not continue doing the same thing, midfield games, all his life. But he did many very different things in quantitative finance, including things he's going to talk about today, optimal liquidity provision. And he's been working on topics related to decentralized finance in the recent years. So I leave the floor to Olivier, who will talk about his recent work on optimal liquidity provision in currency markets, from FX to crypto.
00:02:17.468 - 00:02:18.464, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:02:24.984 - 00:03:06.452, Speaker B: Thank you very much. So, today we are going to orbit around optimal liquidity provision. No mean field game. I swear there will be no mean field games. And I want to talk about the traditional effects and cryptocurrency markets, as you said, and as it's written in the title. And basically it's a summary of, I think, four papers that you can find on the web. So I don't focus on the papers, but I want to tell you a story and to show the different points regarding traditional effects and crypto markets.
00:03:06.452 - 00:03:45.854, Speaker B: So, a short introduction to market making. First, market makers, market makers are people, or nowadays algorithm providing bid and offer prices to other market participants. And they make money out of capturing part of the bid ask spread. And of course, because they buy and sell, they hold inventory and face the risk that the price moves. And if they are long and if the price goes down, they lose money. And symmetrically. So basically the risk is that the price moves adversely without them being able to unwind their position.
00:03:45.854 - 00:04:30.694, Speaker B: If you want to know more about market making, I do a bit of self advertising, but as you can see, the book on the right, the book of Alvaro, is slightly larger. So maybe it's because it has a far better title, I think. And so you have two books and maybe more today. But these books are about a optimal execution and market making. And if you are, if you want to work in this field, you'd better download the books or buy the books on your favorite platform. So the basic modeling framework for market making, you have a reference price. It's a mid price.
00:04:30.694 - 00:05:15.196, Speaker B: It can be, if you know corporate bonds, it can be the CBBT of Bloomberg or the CP of market access. It's a reference price of that bond that you have at some point in time. Or for FX, for instance, it can be the mid price on some liquid platforms like EBS or Refinitiv. So you need a reference price and then the market maker is going to propose a price at the bid. So I'm considering something quite simple, proposing a price at the bid with a delta. So here, St minus Delta TB and at the ask, St plus delta ta. And of course the market maker is going to choose Delta TB and Delta Ta.
00:05:15.196 - 00:06:03.526, Speaker B: And depending on the depending on the choice of Delta TB and Delta Ta, there will be like a lot of trading flow or high training flow or low trading flow, and you will have an inventory moving up when you sell and when you buy and moving down when you sell. And of course, the probability to buy depends on deltas and on Delta B. And the probability to sell depends on delta. If you propose a good price to clients, there will be a lot of clients coming. If you propose bad price to clients, there will be nobody coming. Basically, this is summarized in the form of an intensity, okay? The intensity of the process. NB and na modeling.
00:06:03.526 - 00:06:36.196, Speaker B: The number of trades, okay? Decreases with delta. The further you are from the price, the lower trading flow, okay? So everything makes sense here. And of course, when you buy, you spend money, when you sell, you make money, okay? So it's an exchange from left pocket to right pocket, left pocket you have assets. I mean here, whatever is the asset here. And in the right pocket you have cash. So you. But of course you have spread capture when you write the p and l.
00:06:36.196 - 00:07:06.574, Speaker B: So the p and l is the cash plus the mark to market value of your portfolio, okay, of your assets. And it's the p and l at the beginning, plus the spread you capture of the trades. Okay, but plus some risk. Okay, inventory risk. If qt is equal to zero, you have no risk, you're flat. If qt is positive, then of course, you're afraid of the price going down. Okay, and this is the term in Dw here.
00:07:06.574 - 00:07:34.154, Speaker B: Okay, so that's the setup. And if you look at the literature, there are two objective functions. One says, let's take the expected utility of the p and l, where the utility is exponential. That's Avalon, Stoichioff. And there is something preferred by practitioners, which is saying p and l minus some proxy of the variance. In fact, it's the quadratic variation. And in that case, you maximize this.
00:07:34.154 - 00:07:59.434, Speaker B: So p and l minus the penalty. Just to say you don't want to hold inventory. And all the more, I mean, you don't, I mean, and this effect is increasing with volatility. If volatility is high, you really don't want to hold inventory. Okay, so that's a problem of control. That's an optimal control problem. In that case, it's optimal control problem on the graph.
00:07:59.434 - 00:08:28.334, Speaker B: But if you know optimal control, you can use all the tools you have. Hamilton Jacobi equation. The change looks like this. So in fact, it's a system of odes. It's not a PDE in that case, because I took constant sizes. Okay, so system of OD is quite nice, where the function h has some like, it's like a legend transform. It's not exactly legend transform, but it can be modified to be a legend transform.
00:08:28.334 - 00:09:32.794, Speaker B: Okay, so that's the setup, classic optimal control setup. And, well, it's a remark, but if you use model a, which is the model where you use an expected utility, then in that case, you obtain almost exactly the same equations. And as I said, you have a system of ods, nonlinear ods. And if you want to obtain mathematical results, it's really not complicated. You simply have natural assumptions plus a technical assumption here, this one here, the last on the slide, which is satisfied by exponential logistic, all the natural intensities you can imagine. And it's really something that makes sense if you, there is a deep reason why this I won't detail, but there is a deep reason why this has to be satisfied when you solve the equation. I go fast on this because it's just a principle of all the models.
00:09:32.794 - 00:10:04.960, Speaker B: Once you solve for the value function, you can have the optimal quotes. Okay, as a function of all the parameters, this is not complicated. And basically, if you look at this model, it's easy to obtain numerically an approximation of theta using an implicit scheme. And then you have standard techniques. Everything is in papers, everything is documented. You can have the optimal codes at the bid and at the ask in these models. Now that's the general stuff.
00:10:04.960 - 00:11:11.790, Speaker B: But what about I said Fx and I said cryptos? What is that specific to Fx or that specific to crypto? Well, first, this is a description of the Fx market that you can find in a paper by Schrempf and Sushko. I think they're working at the BIS, the bank for international settlement. And you see here the, that the FX market is decomposed into a d two c segment where clients ask or are connected to the stream of dealers. That's really OTC and an inter dealer. So id, inter dealer broker market or D 2d dealer to dealer market, where a dealer can trade with a dealer. So dealer trade with clients, okay, but if they only do that, they are waiting for clients to trade with them in some sense, but they can also be active in some sense because they can trade with other dealers. So that's two mechanisms.
00:11:11.790 - 00:12:11.114, Speaker B: You have RFS request for stream or request for quotes on the D two C segment, and you have access to multiple platforms on the D 2d segment, or sometimes on platform where everybody can trade. But the thing is, dealers, they can internalize the flow and wait for clients to come, or they can externalize the flow and say, I'm too long, I want to sell. And of course, in that case, they need to cross the spread or go into a dark pool to cross half of the spread. But they need to do, they are active. In that case, we need to model this. I give you some other figures here still from the same paper. If you look at the one in the middle, the internalization ratio is variable, but say it's between 40 and 80%.
00:12:11.114 - 00:12:33.606, Speaker B: Really only modeling internalization, assuming it's 100%, is wrong. And so we need to model externalization. Also, an interesting figure on the right is the algorithmic versus manual trading on EBS. But, and you see, it's, well, that's a trend. Algorithmic trading is quite huge.
00:12:33.790 - 00:12:37.126, Speaker C: So what is the extent here?
00:12:37.310 - 00:13:16.670, Speaker B: Yes, so the point is the internalization. Yes, you're right, it's not obvious without the two sales. So the internalization versus externalization dilemma has to be taken into account. If we want to build an efficient algorithm, it has to be taken into account. Also something specific, not specific to effects, but something that exists in FX and in other OTC markets. The idea of clients is known. So if you send me a request or if you are connected to my stream, okay, I know who you are and I know who you are.
00:13:16.670 - 00:13:48.154, Speaker B: So maybe I will not propose the same price. Okay? That's called price discrimination. It's not bad. It's just a way to do risk management, to propose different prices to different people based on their alpha, based on their, I mean, you have plenty of reasons to do that, okay? And not bad reasons. I mean, when people hear discrimination, they think it's bad. But it's not only bad, okay, there are good reasons to do that. And of course, sizes are not constant.
00:13:48.154 - 00:14:34.826, Speaker B: And dealer usually proposed a price letter. The proposal price for 1 million, 2 million, 5 million, 10 million. And then we do a VWAP between the prices to have the price for 3 million, I don't know, and 1000. Well, I mean, whatever, any figure, okay? So if I look at the equations with internalization here, I have the price. So I still assume it moves like a buoyant motion, okay, there is just one asset in this model. And every time, so the clients are tiered into n tiers, okay? And every time there is a trade with a client, but if there is a buy, it increases my inventory. And if there is a sell, it decreases my inventory.
00:14:34.826 - 00:15:06.668, Speaker B: Okay, here is just, I have some poisson measures. It's technical, but it's not really important. It's just a client flow from each tier, okay? And then, well, every time I have a trade, either I pay or I receive money. I receive cash. So I have the associated equation in terms of cash. That's exactly the generalization of what we did before. There is nothing like externalization here, okay? I still waiting for clients to trade with me.
00:15:06.668 - 00:15:57.322, Speaker B: I'm passive in some sense. I'm not passive because I can skew my quotes, okay? I can decide on the deltas, I can decide if I trade at a low price, if I buy at a low price, or to deter that kind of flow, or if I want to buy at a very high price to attract sellers. So I'm active in that sense, but I'm passive in the sense that I still wait for the flow to come to me. If you think of externalization, it means that I can also trade on the market. And basically it means that I'm doing optimal execution in some sense. So I can add in blue here the classical terms of I'm going to increase, saying, but if we do, I'm going to increase in continuous time. So optimal execution, it's my inventory evolves in a absolutely continuous way.
00:15:57.322 - 00:16:15.750, Speaker B: But I have a vt dt here. I can buy or sell. I decide whether I buy or sell. But when I buy or when I sell, I have some execution cost. Okay. And the execution cost depends. You can model the fact that, for instance, you need to cross the bid, ask, spread, or stuff like this.
00:16:15.750 - 00:16:47.402, Speaker B: Or if you want to trade a lot, you will have a convex cost, strictly convex. So you can add. Basically it's an encounter between Avalon and Stuikov on one side, and I'm going Chris, on the other side. And now once you have all these ingredients, you can take the same objective function as before and see what happens. But before I do that, let's talk about the tiers. We did an experience here to see how we can tier clients based on how they trade with. Yes.
00:16:47.458 - 00:16:59.604, Speaker C: So you model externalization as if the dealer is actually absorbing all the order flow, then offloading with the bluetooth. Right.
00:17:00.424 - 00:17:02.592, Speaker B: What do you mean by absorbing all the order flow?
00:17:02.648 - 00:17:06.352, Speaker A: Well, I thought externalization means you don't.
00:17:06.408 - 00:17:13.244, Speaker C: Actually do all the trades with the client order flow, but you redirect it to.
00:17:14.144 - 00:17:41.806, Speaker B: Oh no, I don't redirect it. I do, I can, I can still, I do all the trade, but by all the trade I can still control because I control the delta, I can still attract buyers or deter buyers, but it's not something I do back to back. If this is what you have in mind. Yeah, it's not back to back. It's something I trade with clients. And then if I'm too long, I will try to go on another platform to sell.
00:17:41.990 - 00:17:52.484, Speaker C: Yeah, well, here you don't have inventory constraints, but if you do, it makes a big difference if I can match orders.
00:17:53.224 - 00:17:56.064, Speaker B: I don't have inventory constraint, but I have an inventory penalty.
00:17:56.144 - 00:18:01.832, Speaker C: Yeah, but that changes. Right. But if you do blackback to back, you don't charge the true.
00:18:02.008 - 00:18:02.664, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:18:02.744 - 00:18:08.524, Speaker C: Here I can do huge volume of externalization while maintaining my inventory.
00:18:11.624 - 00:18:12.520, Speaker B: Here you can.
00:18:12.632 - 00:18:15.000, Speaker C: So Q will include all the.
00:18:15.072 - 00:18:53.276, Speaker B: Yes. So I was talking a bit about tiering. And so here, you see, we took one of the authors of the three of the question there. Oh, there was a question there. Sorry, I'm sorry. I looked there and the questions are there regarding the externalization term. So what do you assume there is that just crossing the spread? Or does it also includes cases like we just place like a passive order? It's like an ambulance in the sense that the execution cost function summarizes your behavior.
00:18:53.276 - 00:19:26.732, Speaker B: Okay. It means that if you manage with your strategy with passive and aggressive orders to, if you manage to pay on average, say two thirds of the beta spread, then you can put that into that. And it's not also crossing the, it's not only crossing the beta spread, but it can also be something convex saying if you want to trade too much, that's going to be costly. Very costly. Are you making any assumption between the correlation assumption between your liquidity cost and.
00:19:26.748 - 00:19:27.864, Speaker C: The price of the.
00:19:29.684 - 00:20:03.086, Speaker B: Here, I haven't discussed this, but here it's something very important. When I externalize, I send a signal to the market in some sense. Otherwise the market doesn't know it. It's not true. But otherwise the market, if I only, if I'm only internalizing the market, doesn't see anything not completely true because I usually skew my quotes. The market can look at my quotes and based on the skew say, okay, this guy is long, so maybe somebody sold and the inventory is there. Okay.
00:20:03.086 - 00:20:13.422, Speaker B: But here we assume that there is some information leakage or market impact. Okay, it's the first time. Thank you. Because I forgot to discuss it. That was another question.
00:20:13.478 - 00:20:19.438, Speaker C: But one reason you externalize is because of inventory constraints. But this will not appear here.
00:20:19.566 - 00:20:45.634, Speaker B: It's because of inventory cost. It's because of inventory penalty. Here, the reason why I externalize, but it's not like a, it's like instead of having a hard constraint, I have a soft constraint and you can put, if you want to say I have, no, I have a limit. Or you can say something like QT minus the limit plus square and put a high coefficient in front of it. So instead of having a hard cut, you have some, you soften it a bit better.
00:20:51.414 - 00:20:52.222, Speaker C: It's very different.
00:20:52.278 - 00:20:53.206, Speaker D: You have an integral.
00:20:53.270 - 00:20:55.754, Speaker C: So at any point in time, it doesn't matter.
00:20:57.634 - 00:21:02.146, Speaker B: True. Yeah, true. It's running cost. True.
00:21:02.290 - 00:21:08.994, Speaker C: So typically, if I have a lot of skewed order flow, I would externalize the imbalance.
00:21:09.114 - 00:21:09.738, Speaker B: Yes.
00:21:09.866 - 00:21:11.002, Speaker C: That's very intuitive.
00:21:11.098 - 00:21:11.834, Speaker B: Yeah, that's intuitive.
00:21:11.874 - 00:21:14.810, Speaker C: So if you put an inventory constraint, that will happen.
00:21:14.922 - 00:21:15.546, Speaker B: Yes.
00:21:15.690 - 00:21:16.730, Speaker C: But here I'm not sure.
00:21:16.762 - 00:21:53.060, Speaker B: Or here it will happen. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. So, regarding tiers, we calibrated some logistic functions to some data provided by HSBC, and we found out that there are two clusters of clients. Some are price sensitive and some less price sensitive. So it's just to show you an example with two tiers. Of course, in practice, the tiers are based also on commercial relationship, I think, and I mean business relationship. There are plenty of reasons to tier people based on like the information in their flow.
00:21:53.060 - 00:22:32.930, Speaker B: There are plenty of reasons. It's just to say here there are two tiers, and that's it. You can write the equation. So instead of having a system of odes, you have a partial integral differential equation, but still the theory is the same, and you can write the optimal control. So here, now, the control is the price you propose at the bid, the price you propose at the ask, and also the speed at which you externalize. Okay? And of course, it's kind of obvious, but you will sell when you're long, and you will buy it when you're short. Okay? But the speed is interesting.
00:22:32.930 - 00:23:00.088, Speaker B: So here it's the result. We have to concentrate a bit on this. So there are two tiers. Tier one, not that price sensitive. Here is the price we propose for 1 million, 2 million, 5 million, 10 million, and 20 million. Something like this, okay? On the bid side, okay? Depending on the inventory, of course. When we are long, we propose a price that is low because we don't want to buy again and again.
00:23:00.088 - 00:23:21.604, Speaker B: Okay? And symmetrically here, when we are short, okay. We want to buy, so we want to attract sellers. And so we propose a very good price. Okay? That's the zero is basically the reference price. And that's for tier one, it's symmetric for the ask. So we did not put it. We put the one for tier two.
00:23:21.604 - 00:24:09.754, Speaker B: And you see, for tier two, we propose better prices because there are more price sensitive in that case, just to show the difference. But what is interesting here is when we put a spread term, there is an area which we call the pure flow internalization. It's not a real concept, but it's just to say, if we are under this inventory and this inventory, we don't externalize. And we only externalize when there is a threshold of inventory. And it's really linked to the fact that the function l contains a term which is linear in v. Okay? If you take something quadratic, you don't get it, but if you take something like a spread, like a fixed cost to trade. Okay? So, uh, fixed per unit.
00:24:09.754 - 00:24:28.634, Speaker B: I mean, uh, so psi of absolute value of v. In that case, you get this, uh, you get this. This area which says basically here, when you're long, you're going to sell because v is negative. It's here. And when you're short, so.
00:24:28.794 - 00:24:33.494, Speaker C: Sorry. So you're saying without putting an explicit threshold on inventory.
00:24:34.254 - 00:24:39.438, Speaker B: Yes. And it's linked to the value of the betas express. Okay.
00:24:39.566 - 00:24:45.074, Speaker C: This has nothing to do with your performance criteria. Your gamma is very high.
00:24:45.534 - 00:24:47.554, Speaker B: Of course. It depends on the gamma.
00:24:50.174 - 00:24:57.034, Speaker C: But I think for any gamma, you try and be positive, or you have to constrain the.
00:24:58.094 - 00:25:07.642, Speaker B: I think you always have an area like this. Okay, I think. But the thing is, I would have.
00:25:07.658 - 00:25:21.466, Speaker C: Thought that mu is always switched on. I don't think that the solution will tell you not to do anything, crystal. I think it will always tell you to do something, so long as q is different from zero.
00:25:21.610 - 00:25:23.450, Speaker A: That's because they have a transition.
00:25:23.602 - 00:25:40.850, Speaker B: That's because of the. It's not a v square, like in amgren and Chris, but it's a Psi absolute value of v plus something v squared. It's linked to this spread term and some sense. It's like in the Leyland. In the what? Leyland. Yeah, it's like in Leyland. So you have this.
00:25:40.850 - 00:26:04.296, Speaker B: So I think it's quite interesting. And of course, as you said, avaro, if you are really risk averse, then of course that's going to shrink and you're going to say, oh, I'm too long. Let's unwind. Executing on the mark. Let's execute on the market. It's interesting because it's exactly this. When you increase this way, when you increase the risk aversion, you see that you trade.
00:26:04.296 - 00:26:38.152, Speaker B: You almost trade the same amount with the. We did the Monte Carlo here. I don't give full details, but you trade a lot, and you trade the same amount, approximately, with the people that are not that price sensitive. But when you increase risk aversion, you decrease the volume. You trade with the people that are price sensitive because you don't make a lot of money out of them. Okay? So when you take a position, you make less money, so you don't want to trade with them, and instead you are. So it's the same color code than here.
00:26:38.152 - 00:26:52.124, Speaker B: Instead, orange. You hedge, as they say. So it means you externalize the flow. Okay. You don't externalize the flow. I understand. You don't externalize your flow, but you externalize.
00:26:52.124 - 00:26:58.176, Speaker B: You go see somewhere else if somebody can take a bit of your inventory, not your flow. You're right.
00:26:58.280 - 00:27:20.992, Speaker C: Yeah. But I think normally you do take in your quotes, and you immediately adword. Bear in mind that these three quotes, to clients who you honor, the quotes, they trade on your quote, and then you decide to unwind. So it does go into your quotes before you decide to go elsewhere. It's not that I want to buy from you. And you say, hold on, only if you can get rid of it, will you trade with me? No, it goes into your quotes and.
00:27:21.008 - 00:27:37.584, Speaker B: Then you decide, in effect, for sure, there is no back to back on the phone. You don't wait for somebody. Yeah. On other, like, maybe on copyright bonds, you can say, wait a minute, maybe I have somebody else. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like the two phone guy for dealers.
00:27:38.804 - 00:27:43.884, Speaker C: But you have single deal trading platforms do that.
00:27:43.924 - 00:27:44.564, Speaker A: They match.
00:27:44.684 - 00:28:04.154, Speaker B: They match and more. But, but this is why I say incorporate bonds. A few years ago, I read some reviews of the market saying there is more like back to back and like. But I have no, I have.
00:28:06.614 - 00:28:08.194, Speaker C: Algorithmic. Right, so.
00:28:08.974 - 00:29:05.094, Speaker B: Yeah, that's not a. You don't have an algorithm. Yeah. And here is just to show that in spite of the fact that we use a tiny approximation to compute the quotes, when we randomize the quotes around the thing, we obtain the same efficient frontier for different. This is for different gammas, okay? And basically we managed to have an exchange that's for one currency. And of course, in practice, if you talk with an FX market maker, an FX dealer, they don't care about trading USDU, or they care about having like being a one stop shop and proposing quotes on everything, even on things where you cannot hatch, like, I don't know, maybe there is no market for Zimbabwe. Yeah, yeah.
00:29:05.094 - 00:29:28.916, Speaker B: And a lot of digits, but there are pairs, for which of course you want to propose as a dealer, you want to propose some bid and ask quotes, but you can hedge. But still you can hedge with us dollars. Okay? So there is an interest for having multi currency. So here we took a problem. There is no math problem here. It's just a question of modeling. And it's not obvious.
00:29:28.916 - 00:29:52.140, Speaker B: There are some tricks. If you try to do it, you're stuck. And at some point, there is a point where we say, okay, that's the way to proceed. To have a model. So you have D stochastic, d currencies. So you need to have first one currency, which is here for accounting. So you can choose USD, okay? Or EUR if you prefer, or GBP if you like GBP.
00:29:52.140 - 00:30:41.274, Speaker B: Nobody does that but USD or EUr, let's say USD. And I will assume there are d tiers of clients. And the thing is, I don't want to enter into full details, but the thing is to have a model that works. So to have the equation that, to have good equations, I will assume that even if I trade, I don't know. Chfsek. Okay, so swiss franc against swedish crown, okay, I will assume that the sizes are constant in USD, it's just people send an order. And I will assume that from one at any time they will say 1 million, 2 million, or 5 million.
00:30:41.274 - 00:31:16.414, Speaker B: Okay. But in us dollar, of course, there is a tiny change in practice, but it's just a modeling assumption. And I will assume also that the deltas that I have, or here, I assume they are in dips, so multiplicative, which I think is a better assumption than what we did before. And I will assume that they are converted instantaneously to USD. It's weird, but it's just otherwise the equations are completely messy. Okay. And if you simply do these two things, okay, you manage to write everything in USD in a nice way.
00:31:16.414 - 00:31:25.694, Speaker B: True.
00:31:26.674 - 00:31:28.334, Speaker C: Why do you need all caps?
00:31:28.794 - 00:31:34.154, Speaker B: Because in practice, the dealers, they want to propose a price for CHF. Sek. Yeah.
00:31:35.614 - 00:31:39.314, Speaker C: Don't they do Chf, Euro, Euro, Sek?
00:31:39.774 - 00:31:45.514, Speaker B: Oh, maybe that's not my ex. My example is wrong. But clearly they don't only trade with USD.
00:31:47.974 - 00:31:49.034, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:31:51.494 - 00:32:06.014, Speaker B: For the example, CHF, SDK, euro would be in between, but clearly not USD. That's the point. Clearly not USD. And you can propose some other stuff, but USD is not all the time in the past you can propose with.
00:32:07.474 - 00:32:09.254, Speaker D: Everything applies to USD.
00:32:09.714 - 00:32:52.128, Speaker B: Yes, but USD, so is my currency for doing accountancy or whatever, but still, I want to propose some quotes on tears that do not include USD. That's the point. Maybe Sekf is not the right example, but that's the idea. And I will assume that on all currency pairs there is a market. It's not true at all, but I will explain why it's a good assumption anyway. On any currency pair there is a market where I can unwind my position up to a cost. If the market doesn't exist, I put the cost to something very high.
00:32:52.128 - 00:33:22.696, Speaker B: And of course there will be no trading. If the bid ask spread is infinite, there is no market. But still, I assume that I can trade any currency pair and one on each currency pair. And this is the term that was before, to guarantee that there is an area, a zone, where I don't unwind my position. So don't focus on the equation. They are of course boring and cumbersome. Okay, question.
00:33:22.840 - 00:33:26.444, Speaker D: Why is there smaller than J?
00:33:26.944 - 00:33:39.790, Speaker B: Because here Xi is signed, you can buy or sell. So it means that I only need half of the matrix of the matrix.
00:33:39.862 - 00:33:42.238, Speaker C: But then you have triangle arbitrary.
00:33:42.326 - 00:33:42.994, Speaker B: True.
00:33:44.334 - 00:33:46.234, Speaker C: So there are two main things.
00:33:46.614 - 00:33:49.726, Speaker B: There are too many things, but still there is a market.
00:33:49.910 - 00:33:52.982, Speaker C: Just d variable, not d squared over two.
00:33:53.078 - 00:34:07.294, Speaker B: But because of the execution cost, I will pay more. So it's not. I don't create arbitrage. Some sense, you know, it's. There is always a beta spread. So the arbitrary. The triangles are only theoretical in practice.
00:34:07.294 - 00:34:17.534, Speaker B: It's. You, you don't. I mean, you need to have something like this to really have arbitrageurs here. I don't. I don't create arbitrary. That I'm sure because. Oh, white, I would have a crazy.
00:34:17.534 - 00:34:42.151, Speaker B: Where's the restrictions? No, no, there is no restriction. I just say there could be. But the thing is. No, no, no, no, sorry. There is none. Because here there are only deep prices. And the mid price for a pair that does not involve USD is, of course, the ratio between the two.
00:34:42.151 - 00:35:24.962, Speaker B: No, no, of course, of course, of course. It's just here I can trade anything, any currency pair. And in practice, if there is no market for SDK CHF, that I just put the side to like, something super high. And of course, nobody will trade on this. That's the idea. You look at the equation, of course, we also put some market impact of our trading. I don't want to focus much on this, but the idea is you get a multi, I mean, a multi currency objective function, okay? Which is almost the same as before, except that the right variable is the variable converted into dollar.
00:35:24.962 - 00:36:05.458, Speaker B: It's not your inventory, it's something converted into dollar. Okay? You end up with something crazy in terms of Hamilton Jacobi Bell male equation. And theoretically you can prove that there are optimal quotes. Okay, I don't want to, like. I just want to show you that there are equations, but of course, I don't want you to read this. Okay. The thing is, if you think about it, what is the number of equations, the dimension of that stuff? If you look at here, the value function depends on t, the time, and y, and y is basically my inventory.
00:36:05.458 - 00:36:32.804, Speaker B: So it's a vector dimension d. It's my inventory in dollar of each currency. So it's in dimension d. If I want to have 20 currencies, I have a problem in dimension 20. Of course, I can't solve an AGB equation on a grid in dimension 20, so I'm stuck. I can say there is a simple structure on the correlation. Maybe I can use some factor methods that doesn't work really well.
00:36:32.804 - 00:37:34.606, Speaker B: We can use reinforcement learning, but slow and quite dangerous sometimes. Here we use something which we like created in some sense in another paper. It's to say, okay, we have a huge equation here, but if the h function here and the h function here is quadratic, then trust me, there is an explicit solution. So the thing is, let's take h quadratic by taking a quadratic approximation of the h. It's slightly more complicated than this because h is decreasing, but usually there is this h of p and h of minus p. So overall, you take the even part of the function and things are u shaped. So replacing them by parabola is an approximation.
00:37:34.606 - 00:38:15.162, Speaker B: But I mean, you have to do something if you want to go to dimension 20. So this is what we do. It's called Begv trick because it's bergo, evangelista, myself and Vieira, something we did in another paper. And basically the idea is if you replace, hmm, functions by quadratic functions, okay, so it's just a Taylor expansion. Then we have value functions that are polynomial of degree two in Y. So polynomial in dimension d, but of degree two. And the coefficients to solve rickety equations.
00:38:15.162 - 00:39:03.532, Speaker B: Rickety equations are odes paradise compared to PDE's. And so we can solve that we tried in low dimensions. So when you have only a few currencies, we could do PDE's and this. And it works really well, except in one case, if there is a lot of flow asymmetry, it means if there are a lot of buyers and only a few sellers, then the approximation are not that good, but otherwise, surprisingly very good. Okay, here, for instance, it's an example with three currencies. So you have a full triangle. So you have Euro USD cable, Euro GBP, you have everything.
00:39:03.532 - 00:39:59.804, Speaker B: And, I mean, I don't want to spend time analyzing this, but basically it means that what you see is that, of course, when you have long GBP inventory, you don't want to attract people to buy even more GBP. Okay? And even there is even an influence on the EUR USD pair, because there is a correlation structure between the three stuff. Here is another example where I think we took five. Yeah, five, four plus one USD. Of course, not risky. In that case, where we looked at the, at the hedging strategy, the optimal externalization strategy, and we always see this area where we don't externalize. Interestingly, here we looked at the density of the inventory.
00:39:59.804 - 00:40:37.114, Speaker B: So two dimension density of the inventory. And so when we play the strategy, we do Monte Carlo, and we see that it's really aligned with the ellipsis that corresponds to the correlation. We input it into the equation. So really it manages the risk in line with the risk. It manages the risk in line with the risk. We input it just to show you a short animation before I go to crypto. It's just an example of the strategy, just to show you.
00:40:37.114 - 00:41:06.220, Speaker B: Okay, so here we have three currencies. Okay. And here it's, what do you say? Blinking. So you have the trading on one pair, then on the next, then on the next. Here you see the different streams that I propose. And of course, the skew depends on my inventory, whether I'm long euro or. And long GBP or short euro and short GBP.
00:41:06.220 - 00:41:42.684, Speaker B: And when you look, of course I won't spend time on this, but it's consistent. And here you see, every time you have a huge trade, every time you have a huge trade with a client, not every time, but sometimes when you have a huge trade with a client, you start hedging a bit. Okay. So externalizing the flow with tiny transactions. Okay. So it's really something we exemplified with like, say three, five, and then we started something with 20 currencies. Yes.
00:41:42.684 - 00:42:05.208, Speaker B: Does it also have anything for our own market impact? Our own market impact, the market impact of our externalization? Yes, yes, yes. In the one decade. Yes. And in the. In the multi currency. Yes. Every time we trade, we impact the price with respect to dollar.
00:42:05.208 - 00:42:57.444, Speaker B: So it means that if we trade a currency where is, where there is no dollar in it, we have the same market impact as if we did the trades through USD to be consistent. But yes, there is this. The things that are not in the model are adverse selection so important in the case of market making. So this is not in the model and also informed trading, but that you can tier people and say, this guy, look, when I trade with him is some flow that are not really normal. And also there is not another idea. Sometimes I have questions about this, my quotes, okay, tell something. If I skew, it tells something about my position.
00:42:57.444 - 00:43:16.936, Speaker B: So even though I did not trade on the market, so I didn't send orders. Okay. People see that I'm wrong in some sense. So if you take that into account, then you will skew a little bit less to give less information. But there are a few missing stuff. Of course, in that case. So that was for effects.
00:43:16.936 - 00:43:54.584, Speaker B: And now I want to speak, I have still ten minutes. I want to speak a bit about cryptocurrency, just to say I'm not a crypto guy. I was not really interested in crypto. I have never bought a bitcoin, so I was not hooked on it. But in 2021, three days before Christmas, so I guess the guy was bored. I didn't know what to do. I received an email from somebody called David Buba, who co founded an imm, an automated market called Swap, maybe, you know, uniswap.
00:43:54.584 - 00:44:30.840, Speaker B: So it's another amm, and quite interesting, he sent me a white paper, interesting remark and an invitation to discuss with him. And less than a year later we released the paper that I'm presenting here. Okay. And I want to give you some ideas about what it is basically really cross learning between traditional finance and decentralized finance. So just an introduction. We all know the different mechanisms to trade or to take liquidity. You have limit orders, auctions, stock pools, request for quotes, request for stream.
00:44:30.840 - 00:45:11.154, Speaker B: But AMM is something different. It's a mechanism by which traders can swap one asset against another using a pool of reserves posted by other agents that we call liquidity providers. So you have liquidity providers, they supply reserves to the pool, and you have liquidity takers. They use the amm to trade using the available liquidity. And the exchange rate is based on a predefined and public flow, okay, that depends on the setup of the, of the amm, okay. And depends on the transaction size and on the direction of swap. These Amm, they differ from dealer markets because anybody can provide liquidity.
00:45:11.154 - 00:45:45.840, Speaker B: They differ from order driven market because when you send a limit order, you send a limit order with a price. Here the price is determined by a formula of the amm. They differ from dark pool because you see the liquidity, there is pre trade transparency in some sense. So it's really different. Another difference is that they are fully collateralized, but that has nothing to do with what I will talk about. Classical amms are CFMMs. They are the most popular ones.
00:45:45.840 - 00:46:34.654, Speaker B: And the idea is you have say you want to do bitcoin against USDC, and basically you want a given formula to remain constant. Usually, I don't know if I write it here, but usually it can be the product that's a CPmm. You want that constant to remain, you want that constant, you want that formula to remain constant across trades. Okay, so if there is a trade with the platform buying delta q one and swapping this delta q one against delta q zero, I want this. So after the trade to be equal to this before the trade, okay. Similarly, it's the implicit function CRM. If f is well defined, some properties, natural properties, then it means that qt zero is always a function of.
00:46:34.654 - 00:47:10.074, Speaker B: It's always determined by a function of qt one. The two currencies are zero and one. In practice, there are transaction costs, so it slightly modify the formula. But that's the idea. And the most common cfmms are constant product market makers in which the function fix is the product of the two. So you are basically, on hyperbolas, q one is equal to q zero is equal to a constant divided by q one. Okay? If you look at what happens here.
00:47:10.074 - 00:47:51.396, Speaker B: So I take the equation that I wrote before here, but in this form, and I say, whenever a client wants to sell delta, so an Lt wants to sell delta q one coins, that client will receive delta q zero of currency zero. And I want this to be verified. But qt zero was psi of qt one. And so the price is the ratio between the two stuff. And it's like this. Symmetrically, it's the same. And if I pass to the limit for infinitesimal traits, it means that the mid price, the exchange rate, it should not differ from minus the derivative of the function side, just because here you have finite differences and you pass through the limit.
00:47:51.396 - 00:48:46.164, Speaker B: Okay? If you look at what happens for the payoff of liquidity providers, it's a bit technical in terms of math, but it's just a legend transform. You look at the P and L of LP's and PNL of people that would have stayed outside of the pool. We call that the holder strategy, the buy and hold strategy, okay? And because psi, or, you see, psi is convex and psi star is, in any case, convex, you see that this. The difference between the p and l and the p and l of staying outside of the pool is negative. So you can say, but why do people provide liquidity to that? That's also a question I have in some sense, but here it's because the story is incomplete. There are some transaction costs, okay? They are exposed to a negative payoff, which looks like. Which looks like an option, okay? Payoff.
00:48:46.164 - 00:49:06.604, Speaker B: So contingent claim in some sense, but to compensate, they have some transaction costs. So if there is a lot of flow, it's fine. If there is not a lot of flow, it's not fine. And if the market. If the. If the price deviates a lot, it's not fine at all. Okay? So this is the idea.
00:49:06.604 - 00:49:39.276, Speaker B: Because of this impermanent laws, the laws that we have here, uniswap v three, they propose to reduce the risk. The risk faced by LP is by concentrating liquidity in an interval of price. It means that you decide if you want to know more, there is a nice paper by Alvaro and the three of them. Yeah. The last row of the rule. Yeah. So you can decide to post liquidity, but only over range of price.
00:49:39.276 - 00:50:19.640, Speaker B: If suddenly the price get out of that range, and in that case, the option would be very negative, then basically, you don't post liquidity, your liquidity disappears. Here, we explore a different mechanism in which the pricing function uses some information from another trading venue. We do. In OTC trading, we import some reference price, as I said before. So, basically, I want to import the ids from effects from any market making in traditional finance to defy here. But there are some differences. Okay.
00:50:19.640 - 00:50:51.254, Speaker B: And I will propose some mean variance framework. I will explain. I will go fast, because I have five minutes remaining. The idea is I will do exactly the same thing as in the previous model with Fx. So I will decide that there is one currency that I use for accounting between the two things. And basically, as before the markup, I convert them into currency zero. In practice, it doesn't work this way.
00:50:51.254 - 00:51:23.224, Speaker B: But you can. I mean, I can explain a mechanism by which it's almost equivalent. And so that's an example. So, if a clients want to sell z coins of currency zero at time t, then it will receive z divided by s coins of currency one, and it will basically pay a bit as a markup. It's just in the model. You can assume it's in currency zero and currency one. I assume that everything is in the accounting currency because the equation are simple.
00:51:23.224 - 00:52:01.794, Speaker B: In that case, I do everything, as I did before, for market making. But there is one difference, okay? Which is that I don't care about the return. I care about the difference between the p and l of the Lp and the p and l of somebody outside of the pool because the assets are risky. Okay? The position is not zero. For some reason, people have bitcoins, and they decide to put them in the pool or not to put them in the pool. I don't want to discuss the reason why they have bitcoin, okay? They have bitcoins. They can decide to put them in the pool or not in the pool.
00:52:01.794 - 00:52:24.872, Speaker B: So it's like there is a benchmark. So instead of having. Instead of having volatility, I have some tracking error. I mean, it's really, you benchmark everything, and you want to see what happens to the model when you benchmark to the other strategy. So we build a market simulator to see what happens. And we solved. I will go fast.
00:52:24.872 - 00:52:58.506, Speaker B: And we solved the Hamilton Jacobi equation, but here, I'll skip that. We built the Hamilton Jacobi equation. We did a tiny approximation to remove some of the variables to be able to compute the value function and what we built. I want to go to this graph. What we build is basically simulator, in which you see here what happens. So I know my simulator knows exactly the price. It's not true in practice.
00:52:58.506 - 00:53:43.906, Speaker B: There are oracles, but here it's with a perfect oracle of the price. And I will assume, for instance, that I always quote at, say, two beeps, six beeps, ten beeps, 14 beeps, 18 bits from the mid price. Of course, nobody can trade at the mid price. This is, there is just a demand function for some bitcoin at a distance from the mid price. And here is what I get the best I can do using my optimal strategy. And here it's what uniswap and balancer and curve are doing. And here it's the standard deviation of the excess p and l means compared to by an old strategy.
00:53:43.906 - 00:54:32.636, Speaker B: And here it's the mean of the XsPNA. So it's like in Markovitz when you benchmark, okay? And you see here that the things that do exist today are not that good, okay? And here it's far better. But of course I assume that I know the price, okay? So it's really far from defi in some sense. So I need to study what happens when I don't know the price, when there are misspecification, when there are misses specification with respect to the trading flow. It's just that I'm basically doing a tiny promenade on the optimal, on the efficient curve. It's not really interesting. Same thing for, if I'm wrong on the volatility of the pair, same thing.
00:54:32.636 - 00:55:08.900, Speaker B: I stay almost on the, on the efficient frontier. And that's it for mu. If a mu is misspecified, I think here it's only for half a day, so we don't really see a difference. But that's not really interesting. What is interesting is what happens with oracles. Okay? So before I assume that the market exchange rates, the reference price in market making model was known at all times in practice, I only have an idea of that, okay? It can be noisy, it can be lagged. There are many problems, okay? So it's only a discrete time.
00:55:08.900 - 00:56:15.604, Speaker B: And I said that. So here what happens is that I will play my strategy, okay, for different risk aversion, different values of the risk aversion, but with a lag. So I will assume that I have perfect information, that's the efficient curve, or I have a ten second delay in the price or a 32nd delay or a 1 minute delay or something you can see, but it basically says here that it's more. And you see that basically if we are at even a 32nd delay or even 1 minute delay is okay and it's far better than what Uniswap does. So the morality, if I can say so, is that importing information from outside increases the risk profile and the performance of the dealers of the liquidity providers. That's an interesting error. So it increases the risk profile in the plan here.
00:56:15.904 - 00:56:19.804, Speaker C: How do you see this in your picture? What's being compared?
00:56:20.144 - 00:56:47.008, Speaker B: If you remember the uniswap, it's basically because you have to have this in mind here. All these things, they were in the negative territory of the mean, okay. You lose money on average. Okay. If you are a liquidity provider inside a CPMM, basically this assumes you're not hedging out. Yes.
00:56:47.096 - 00:56:48.524, Speaker D: If you hedge it out.
00:56:48.944 - 00:56:49.392, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:49.448 - 00:56:52.684, Speaker D: Because you basically just show an option gamma.
00:56:53.664 - 00:57:42.954, Speaker B: Yes, yes. It does not incorporate this, but you have to be sophisticated. And most of the people, when they post, they don't. But true, I mean, you short gamma, you need to, you need to do, you need to hedge your position. But I mean, then if you think of a mean field problem, if you think of equilibrium, I mean at some point, where do you hedge? So here you see that you entered negative territory of mean only when basically you have five minute delay on this example. But if you have ten second delay, 32nd delay, it's fine. Okay, so importing information from an oracle is better than importing information from arbitrageurs.
00:57:42.954 - 00:58:23.784, Speaker B: Because at some point arbitrageurs, they are just giving you information about where the price is and you lose money out of arbitrageurs. So basically it's a bit better. We also added some arbitrageurs, systematic arbitrageurs in that case. And that did not change much for some reason. I can explain, because basically when in the demand curve we are, which is logistic, it's like there is already some arbitrage, okay, some arbitrageurs. If you really price something that is completely off compared to the market, you will have people coming anyway. It's not systematic, it's probabilistic.
00:58:23.784 - 00:59:10.380, Speaker B: But you still have this. And here it's an example, like with everything, okay, here you have the classical uniswap v two. So without concentrate, without cl, without concentrated liquidity. Here you have the frontier with arbitrageurs. And I think perfect oracle. But we have seen that even when the oracle is not perfect, it's far better than all these guys here. So the main result is that traditional CFM perform poorly relative to the efficient frontier and very often exhibit negative excess p and l.
00:59:10.380 - 00:59:41.014, Speaker B: I don't know the statistics. I know you guys, you know the statistics on uniswap v two. And if I remember well, in practice, LP's were losing money. Like 90% of the LP's were losing money. But they want to be part, they want to be in the boat, they want to be part of the story. So they don't care about losing a bit of money. Maybe the point is allowing an amM to get information about the current, about the current market exchange rate through an oracle can significantly improve the performance.
00:59:41.014 - 00:59:51.674, Speaker B: It reduces the volatility of the excess p and l and allows to deliver a positive access p and L. Another answer could be forget that and hedge a bit.
00:59:51.794 - 01:00:04.638, Speaker D: Okay, so just on that second point, maybe I'm misunderstanding, but on the automated market maker is updating it far more than the traditional.
01:00:04.826 - 01:00:05.326, Speaker C: Correct?
01:00:05.390 - 01:00:07.262, Speaker B: Or what do you mean by updating?
01:00:07.318 - 01:00:13.198, Speaker D: Well, because he's getting more information. Because you. It's getting the automated market.
01:00:13.246 - 01:00:14.950, Speaker B: Oh, you mean the price changes far more.
01:00:15.022 - 01:00:23.590, Speaker D: Exactly, yeah. So is he not updating his, like, what he's sending into the LP for more than if it just been a traditional.
01:00:23.782 - 01:00:24.550, Speaker B: For sure.
01:00:24.662 - 01:00:30.114, Speaker D: So then does that not, does that not result in a cost of gas?
01:00:30.584 - 01:00:56.776, Speaker B: Depends how. Depends whether you do that on chain or off chain. It depends. But still, the philosophy is that the code is public. Yeah, it raises a lot of information about the philosophy of Defi. I agree with you. And the general conclusion is market making models are important for OTC markets because of automation.
01:00:56.776 - 01:01:24.994, Speaker B: There are still many effects that need to meet model. I talked about adverse selection, information leakage, about the skew. You can have other ids. There are still a lot of stuff to do. For example, also I talk about the meat prices, the reference prices. Clearly, inventing your own reference price that is relevant is a statistical problem, filtering problem. That is interesting.
01:01:24.994 - 01:02:09.674, Speaker B: So, estimating the flow, the probability of people trading with you is something quite important. And research on IMM is very active. There are people at Berkeley, there are people at. Who am I? And there are. I think the topic is interesting, even beyond cryptos, of course, the assets must be digital to be on this, but it's really a new way, a new trading mechanism in some sense. And I think it's interesting to, to study, and I know there are a lot of problems, there are a lot of people working on different problems in this. So you already told, you already asked questions, but I'm still, I'm still very open to questions and discussions.
01:02:16.954 - 01:02:18.014, Speaker C: Any question.
01:02:19.594 - 01:02:23.338, Speaker D: So how is the market material adapted.
01:02:23.386 - 01:02:25.734, Speaker C: Into your SGP equation for the crypto?
01:02:26.594 - 01:02:34.514, Speaker B: The difference between the HP equation between fx and crypto, it's basically, for example.
01:02:34.554 - 01:02:36.514, Speaker D: The constant function c is not easily.
01:02:36.554 - 01:02:42.374, Speaker B: Included in your SG. Well, there is no externalization if that's your question.
01:02:43.544 - 01:02:53.448, Speaker D: I mean, market mechanism, for example, the constant function market makers. There is a function c. I wonder if this is.
01:02:53.496 - 01:03:18.876, Speaker B: No, no here. No, no here. I want to say, okay, what is the best quote I can provide? I just don't want to optimize to find the best Psi. It's not the topic. I have an oracle. I wasn't clear, I wanted to spend more time on this, but. So there is the oracle I have, and it's like a reference price in traditional markets.
01:03:18.876 - 01:03:38.842, Speaker B: And I want to say, I will propose a price at the bid and a price at the ask as a. Based on this stuff. There is no more. It's not a CPMM. The amm we have here, it's clearly not a CPMM because I don't want to be exposed to the. I don't want to be exposed to the option.
01:03:38.938 - 01:03:41.778, Speaker C: So you compare this to the CPM at the end?
01:03:41.866 - 01:03:49.094, Speaker B: Yes, that's the idea. I was fast. I want, I want, I wanted to cover maybe too many stuff.
01:03:49.994 - 01:03:51.614, Speaker C: Other questions?
01:03:51.914 - 01:04:00.408, Speaker D: Sorry, non technical question. But the guy who messaged you automated.
01:04:00.496 - 01:04:01.124, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:01.464 - 01:04:03.644, Speaker D: Have you proposed that idea to him?
01:04:04.424 - 01:04:07.884, Speaker B: Of course. They are implementing this. Yeah.
01:04:10.864 - 01:04:12.684, Speaker D: When did I expect it to?
01:04:13.224 - 01:04:42.264, Speaker B: I think it's. I think that the version is in production, but they did something based on this. I have, I don't know exactly what they did, but. So it's a french company, I think this month they raised a little bit less than 5 million USD, which I mean, I think given the current market conditions is not that bad.
01:04:48.164 - 01:05:17.064, Speaker C: One question in this framework, bladder. This framework basically like framing this problem as it was like an effects problem. So yeah, so you don't have like CPMms and MMs anymore. So my question I would be. So you would, you would have to compare this market to binance, for example, to an inventory book based market. What are the advantages of training here compared to trading to a program limit order?
01:05:18.424 - 01:05:20.164, Speaker B: What do you mean by comparing?
01:05:20.864 - 01:05:24.244, Speaker C: So why would I trade here instead of trading on binance?
01:05:27.464 - 01:06:11.816, Speaker B: But I'm more interested in the P and L of LP's. So the thing is, I'm interested in the PNL of LP's and I'm comparing the different platforms. So CPMMs or CFMMs in general and this kind of framework with just an oracle. I'm comparing them from the point of view of LP's, assuming that there is no, because in fact the real problem is super complicated because you need to, you I mean, you know that, but you have LP's. But you need to anticipate the number of LP's that will be there in the future, because what you will, the money you will make depend on the. On the number of LP's that are with you. It's.
01:06:11.816 - 01:06:13.712, Speaker B: It's quite messi.
01:06:13.768 - 01:06:16.884, Speaker C: You know, because the market in binance can be framed in the same way.
01:06:17.584 - 01:06:18.896, Speaker B: Market in market.
01:06:19.000 - 01:06:26.080, Speaker C: In markets like finance, can you frame from an perspective the same way?
01:06:26.272 - 01:06:49.304, Speaker B: So, yeah, I understand what you mean. It's because given the size of the tick size on binance, which is quite small. Yes, you can say, but this is my point of view here, is that the LP's are just investors, like investing in a given market making strategy. Does that make sense to you? Yeah.
01:06:50.844 - 01:06:54.892, Speaker C: And also, another question. So when you define your state values.
01:06:54.988 - 01:06:55.516, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:55.620 - 01:07:06.164, Speaker C: So you assume that your y and your x are like the value at time, t minus the value times zero.
01:07:07.504 - 01:07:11.084, Speaker B: So this is because I'm compared to other.
01:07:11.384 - 01:07:23.004, Speaker C: Yes, yes. And what I'm saying then is like, if you use, like, your y as a risky asset, you assume when y is equal to zero, then your risk is neutral.
01:07:25.224 - 01:07:52.894, Speaker B: I have no risk, you mean? Yeah, yeah. I ask you, I must assume. Your point is, I must have one currency, which is the accounting currency. And it's true that if I take a pool, which is, say, e versus BDC or ether between, if I assume that BDC is the accounting currency, or if I assume that etH is the accounting currency, I don't get exactly the same result.
01:07:55.554 - 01:07:59.178, Speaker C: Yeah. My question was more like, if your y is equal to zero here.
01:07:59.346 - 01:08:32.724, Speaker B: Yeah. No, it means that my position is exactly the same as if I did buy an old. It's really the position. The position is really the position compared to the biennial strategy, which is what you do when you compare to other. The problem is there are other paper in which you hedge, and in that case, it's not. You can say, odal is not the right benchmark. This is basically your opinion, I guess.
01:08:34.864 - 01:08:35.296, Speaker D: So.
01:08:35.360 - 01:08:36.724, Speaker A: Thank you very much for.
01:08:38.704 - 01:08:39.104, Speaker B: Thank you.
