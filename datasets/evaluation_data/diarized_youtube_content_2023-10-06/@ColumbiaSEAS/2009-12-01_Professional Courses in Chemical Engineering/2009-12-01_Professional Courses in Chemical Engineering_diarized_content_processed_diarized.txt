00:00:00.250 - 00:00:17.182, Speaker A: One of the cool things about the class is the name of the class. The name of the class is molecular engineering and product design. And it's an intriguing name, and it really reflects changes that have occurred and are occurring in chemical engineering. And we want to excite students about that.
00:00:17.316 - 00:00:45.046, Speaker B: The idea there is to give students in the first two years, early on, an exposure to what chemical engineering practice is like, and it aids in their decision. So either they like it or they don't like it, and they're more well informed about making their decision and to not leave professional aspects completely at the tail end, that really the fundamentals and the practice have to be integrated.
00:00:45.158 - 00:01:02.138, Speaker A: The students that take our course are typically first year, although we have some sophomores and juniors, and these are students that are considering different options for engineering degrees. And this is our opportunity to show them what's possible in a chemical engineering degree.
00:01:02.314 - 00:01:09.938, Speaker B: It gives, I think, an entree into engineering practice at a very early level.
00:01:10.104 - 00:01:59.534, Speaker A: Giving the students an idea of what chemical engineering, where it's come from, what it is now, and where it's going is probably the largest goal of the course. But in addition to that, we try to give them a feel for our department as well. And we do that by having guest faculty come in and speak about their field that they work in. And we have a variety of fields of specialty in the department, and we also have some practitioners in the field come in and speak to the students. We like to have alumni come in. That's always nice to see where our graduated students are working and the sorts of work they're doing. But there's also lots of local people in industry who are interested in speaking to the class and trying to communicate the excitement of their part of chemical engineering.
00:01:59.534 - 00:02:22.374, Speaker A: So really communicating that excitement and the breadth of opportunities in chemical engineering is the most important focus of the course. In addition to that, we try to give them some idea of the rigor of the education that they'll get. So we go through some sample chemical calculations and go through some of the broad principles in chemical engineering.
00:02:22.502 - 00:02:37.070, Speaker B: In engineering practice, engineers almost never work in isolation. They work in groups, and there's information gathering, there's planning, there's reporting. All of these sorts of things are introduced in that course.
00:02:37.220 - 00:03:24.170, Speaker A: We have a project in which students design and build a chemical product, and that product is a fuel cell that powers a toy automobile. And the goal of the project is to give students a chance to think about what a chemical product should do, how it should perform, and then try to design that product to meet those goals and then demonstrate that the product meets the goals. This is the fuel cell. And on either side is simply a tank of water that will eventually contain hydrogen. And then on the right side, a tank of water, which will contain oxygen. And the cell has a very thin layer on the inside where all the action takes place. And we can charge up these tanks with hydrogen and oxygen.
00:03:24.170 - 00:03:53.090, Speaker A: And what happens when we hook the fuel cell into the car is the oxygen recombines with hydrogen to form water. And the energy that's released is in the form of electrons that travel through an external circuit. So this is electricity flowing through the motor that causes the wheels to turn. And then on the last day of the class, we have a demonstration, which students actually have a competition where they race their cars. And the groups who actually achieve their design goals are awarded prizes.
