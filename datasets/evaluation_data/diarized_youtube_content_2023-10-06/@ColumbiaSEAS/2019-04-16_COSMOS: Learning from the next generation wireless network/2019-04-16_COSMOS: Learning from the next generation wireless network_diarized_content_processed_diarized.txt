00:00:01.290 - 00:00:20.960, Speaker A: Cosmos is a research project that is developing next generation wireless technology. And one of the really exciting parts of it is that there's a live test bed here in West Harlem. So, Cosmos ran a research experience for teachers this summer, working with us to develop educational toolkits related to wireless technology.
00:00:21.730 - 00:00:47.450, Speaker B: Essentially, what I wanted to do was delve specific into the heat island effect. We've identified three data collection sites. We want to really learn about how to transmit data from sensors. We're actually bringing what's possible to the room. They're actually going to be able to utilize not only this kind of technology to do legitimate scientific study, but it also empowers students. It gives them agency.
00:00:48.350 - 00:01:10.878, Speaker C: The Cosmos education toolkit is a downscale version of the Cosmos pespet that we build in Harlem. So the same hardware that we use in order to evaluate the next generation wireless technologies, we use to allow the students to execute real experiments and understand the wireless technologies and how they work in the real environment.
00:01:11.054 - 00:01:25.634, Speaker D: It's challenging to bring authentic, hands on science and math lessons into the classroom. The cosmos toolkit really allows for a research lab to come into the classroom so that students can conduct experiments using the toolkit.
00:01:25.762 - 00:01:37.722, Speaker E: Last week, I started talking about signal strength. I gave them a little background. What the signal is. Oh, they were asking, like, really, Ms. Kapa? I mean, this wave, this signal is traveling in waves. I said, yes, it is. It does.
00:01:37.722 - 00:01:52.478, Speaker E: The kids got so curious about it, and when they conduct the actual experiment, they were so happy. They never had the knowledge that when you communicate, they can actually see the real signal strength as a wave on the screen.
00:01:52.644 - 00:02:14.520, Speaker F: I ask them a lot about what their inspiration is and how they use that to come up with innovative solutions for whatever challenge I put in front of them. And I say, write down every question you have. Okay, pick two. Turn them into a testable question. How can you research this? So, just turning their curiosities. They're so much more invested when the questions come from them.
00:02:15.610 - 00:02:26.842, Speaker G: The contents of it just lines up perfectly with complete unit that I have to teach, which involves waves. Showing them graphics like this brings them into a whole new world.
00:02:26.976 - 00:02:43.790, Speaker H: As we move forward, we want other teachers to participate in our program. We are already recruiting teachers for the next round. But more broadly, kids throughout New York City should be able to log in onto the test bed and run experiments locally in our test bed.
00:02:43.940 - 00:03:04.660, Speaker D: Initially, the teachers had a lot of questions, and they struggled. But after a while, the researchers did such a great job, and they had such great patience and supporting them in understanding the concepts and wireless technology then. Now they're the ones going to conferences and teaching other teachers how to do so.
