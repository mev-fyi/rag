00:00:07.130 - 00:01:06.970, Speaker A: Our method consists of using an ultrasound transducer and focus it at a specific region on the order of a few millimeters. After administration of microbubbles, which are micron sized, air filled, lipid shelled, or protein shelled bubbles, together with injection of the drug of choice that would treat the actual brain. So you have the drug that circulates at the same time as the bubbles into the bloodstream. Those bubbles are set in vibration at the same frequency as the ultrasound beam and are exerting mechanical forces on the barrier. The capillary are also set to vibrate and as a result, exert mechanical forces on the tight junctions. The barrier will actually start loosening up and let pharmacological agents, which are also in the bloodstream, to go through and treat the area that's affected by disease.
