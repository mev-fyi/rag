00:00:03.690 - 00:00:22.960, Speaker UNK: In rich countries, you just take the toilet for granted. It's magical that there's a sewer system bringing water in, taking away the waste, and it all gets cleaned up in a processing plant. However, for the poorest two and a half billion in the world, they don't have this.
00:00:23.570 - 00:00:35.254, Speaker A: Alabama was formed by people were from South Carolina because they were wearing out the soils there. And the soils here are great for growing, but not great for wastewater treatment because they hold water.
00:00:35.372 - 00:00:48.970, Speaker B: When a hazardous waste site or a giant garbage dump is located, it is far more likely to be located adjacent to a community of color or a community of low income.
00:00:49.470 - 00:01:17.414, Speaker C: We are trying to push the boundaries in terms of a few different things here. One is, of course, this whole dimension of converting waste streams into very high value products. The whole mindset is changing. It's not wastewater treatment plant anymore. These are resource recovery facilities. Energy recovery facilities. Imagine embedding water factories, energy factories, resource factories, into existing or new developments where people are living, getting clean water, getting energy g, but not from a centralized model.
00:01:17.414 - 00:01:27.270, Speaker C: We are looking for high value end products, chemicals, fuels, and so on. We basically ran a pilot plant in Africa, converting fecal sludge from about five to 10,000 people a day into biodiesel.
