00:00:01.050 - 00:00:46.070, Speaker A: The introductory course in the civil engineering department is called design of buildings, bridges, and aircraft. This is a course that introduces the students to the basic concepts in structural engineering. The students will have the opportunity during the course to design structures like the Eiffel Tower, the George Washington Bridge, and the John Hancock Tower in Chicago ago and see how all these principles are not abstract ideas, but are used in designing real life structures. This course also covers a lot of other material, including construction management. This is a very exciting new area in civil engineering. Geotechnical engineering is covered to some extent. This is dealing with the design of foundations of structures.
00:00:46.070 - 00:01:22.850, Speaker A: Students will work in two laboratory experiments. The first laboratory experiment involves traditional tests of civil engineering materials like steel and rainforest concrete, while the second one examines the high tech part of civil engineering. This field is called structural control and health monitoring of structures and the students will have the option during this lab to make a model of a structure. In addition, the students will be exposed to the use of computers and computing techniques in civil engineering.
