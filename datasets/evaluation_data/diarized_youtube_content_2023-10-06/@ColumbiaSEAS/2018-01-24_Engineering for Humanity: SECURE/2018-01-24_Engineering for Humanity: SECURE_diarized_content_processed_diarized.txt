00:00:00.570 - 00:00:25.254, Speaker A: Security is never a goal in itself. But if you're doing something else with data, you need to protect the data. And how do you protect it while still making it useful? And how do you protect the privacy of people whose data might be in some of these databases? That's the challenge that I work on. If I build a system, I have to build a system that's going to be good enough to protect against attacks that have not been conceived of yet, possibly by people.
