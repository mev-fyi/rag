00:00:00.970 - 00:00:40.946, Speaker A: My name is Sunil Lagraval. I'm a professor here in mechanical engineering, and this is a robotics and rehabilitation laboratory. So the focus of our laboratory is to develop these exoskeletons, which can be used either as assistive devices or training devices for people who have got neural impairments, kinds of diseases that limit your walking function in. The goal is to be able to build and design lightweight, wearable exoskeletons, an exoskeleton that doesn't have explicit joints that can either assist them in their movement or train them so that they could eventually walk without these exoskeletons.
