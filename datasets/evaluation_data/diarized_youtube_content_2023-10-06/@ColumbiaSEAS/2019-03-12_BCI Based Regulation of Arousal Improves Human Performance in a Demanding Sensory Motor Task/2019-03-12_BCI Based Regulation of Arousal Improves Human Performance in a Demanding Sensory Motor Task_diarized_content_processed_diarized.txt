00:00:00.330 - 00:00:55.710, Speaker A: You have you ever been driving a car when suddenly you lost traction and you found yourself jerking the wheel drastically in a panic? As it turns out, airplane pilots sometimes experience a similar problem under difficult flying conditions, they might overcompensate with larger and larger joystick inputs, which can lead to crashes. Such pilot induced oscillations might be caused by a change in brain state triggered under high arousal. We asked whether simultaneous Es EHe based BCI feedback could improve human performance. To test this hypothesis, we used a virtual flight test that was specifically designed to provoke pilot induced oscillations. Our results from 18 healthy adults showed that BCI based feedback significantly improved flight time relative to sham feedback or silence. Supporting evidence was found in heart rate variability and pupil size. We think similar approaches could be used to improve performance in some similar tasks, like driving and more generally in the treatment of mental disorders related to arousal.
