00:00:00.250 - 00:00:39.238, Speaker A: Right now, the electric grid works a little bit like your car. So if you want to go a little bit faster, you just press down the pedal a little more and there's more power. In the future, when most of our energy is coming from renewables, we won't be able to have that kind of energy on demand. So what we have to do is change the way that we demand energy so that it really follows the supply of wind and solar. What this project is all about is taking very, very high resolution measurements of electricity usage in 400 apartments. So my background is mechanical engineering. I have a pretty good sense of the bones and the skeleton that make this thing work, but there are so many other disciplines that you need.
00:00:39.238 - 00:00:53.260, Speaker A: We've got people from the Earth Institute who bring a really broad perspective on what's going on on the climatological level. We've got people from the Data science Institute who really understand how to look at data that we're collecting, and that's going to be a really big issue moving forward.
