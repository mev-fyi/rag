00:00:03.040 - 00:00:52.280, Speaker A: Fabrication at the nanoscale is especially exciting. We can design almost from the ground up, build step by step, almost any structure we want. What I'm personally interested in is the field of nanophotonics, right? Being able to take materials, structures and shape them so that we can then make optical circuits, almost like we have electrical circuits in computers and handheld devices. Imagine having photons inside of that. One of the things about optics, optics is that it enables us to send immense amount of communication bandwidths, right? We are all aware of the fiber optic network around the world. And now imagine taking all of that and being able to put it inside of a chip. Optics is kind of the engine that's going to move data inside all our computing systems.
00:00:52.940 - 00:01:37.540, Speaker B: Usually when we talk about photonics, we talk about novel ways of manipulating light, Manipulate, meaning, control the flow of light, even the speed of light, we are able to control externally. We are collaborating with, for example, Jim Hohn, who is doing the best of the best graphene, and we are integrating these novel materials with the photonic devices. And that will enable devices, for example, with speeds that nobody could dream of before. So we are definitely transitioning the world of electronics to photonics, and that would completely revolutionize the way computers and data centers are done today.
00:01:38.160 - 00:02:05.246, Speaker C: I study the interaction of laser light with matter. My particular branch of what's optics, what's called. It's called nonlinear optics. Probably the best way of thinking about it is the generation of new frequencies. In this particular case, these frequencies form part of what's called a frequency combination. We take light from a laser, and this particular laser is operating in the telecommunications band, and then it gets coupled onto the chip. So there you can see all these new wavelengths that are generated.
00:02:05.246 - 00:02:27.652, Speaker C: Because of that incredible precision, you can use it for a number of different applications, whether it's looking at molecules or identifying molecules. But you can also use it to build very accurate optical clocks. Or you can use each one of those as now a new source, for example, for telecommunications. With Michal's group, we've been pushing to get into the mid infrared.
00:02:27.796 - 00:02:51.096, Speaker B: We design in collaboration with Gaeta's group, and we actually make these combs. It turns out that these devices are sensitive to tiny little voltages. Think, for example, a neuron firing. So applications for chemical sensing, for biological sensing, are very promising using these tiny photonic devices.
00:02:51.288 - 00:03:36.708, Speaker A: Basically, the goal is to bring integrated photonics not only to this research area, but actually manufacturing it. And one of the first applications is datacom. That means data combined with communication. So one of the really important reasons that we are interested in taking integrated photonics, nanoscale photonics, and placing them in all these computing and communication systems is energy. It's a much, much more energy effic technology for moving the data. The combination of the Columbia Initiative, as well as the National Initiative specifically in this area of integrated photonics, have put us at a place in time and space that's unprecedented.
00:03:36.804 - 00:03:46.560, Speaker B: Part of our job is always to look for the big questions. What are the areas that are in need for innovation? So that's our job.
00:03:47.640 - 00:03:47.880, Speaker D: It.
