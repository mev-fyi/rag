00:00:00.810 - 00:00:46.710, Speaker A: Synthetic biology is a field that tries to rationally design the behavior of living organisms. What we do in the lab is try to program bacteria by engineering their dna, and then we will actually put them together with cancer cells and visualize them under the microscope to see how their interactions behave. Having a very visual way to understand the things are happening with bacteria is very useful, and so we are very interested in the process of visualization itself. We work on different ways and techniques to visualize bacteria, whether it's through the microscope or by staining them in different colors. The visualizations can specifically help inspire new ways to detect and treat cancer.
