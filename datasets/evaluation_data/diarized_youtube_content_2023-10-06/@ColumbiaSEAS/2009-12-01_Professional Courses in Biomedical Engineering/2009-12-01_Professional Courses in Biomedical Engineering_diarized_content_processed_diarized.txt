00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.050 - 00:00:18.906, Speaker B: In the first year, we give a course called introduction into biomedical engineering, where we invite some of the leading doctors, physicians, to come and lecture to the students what it's like to work in a biomedical environment.
00:00:19.018 - 00:00:35.154, Speaker A: Part of the attractiveness of biomedical engineering is seeing the link to the clinical sciences. And, and I think that course is so powerful and gives so much information to the students about the clinical impact.
00:00:35.282 - 00:01:16.178, Speaker C: We try to give a little bit of all the topics to the students, and so they have a broad perspective. It's not a course that goes into great detail in any particular subject, but rather is a survey or an overview course of what is going on. And we do this by inviting speakers who are specialists in different fields involving biomedical engineering. We'd like to get as many of the leading figures as we can, if I might say, many of them are thinking of the future and thinking of the students that they want to have in their courses and in their projects. So this is an early recruitment tool for these people.
00:01:16.264 - 00:01:31.242, Speaker A: It's actually quite impressive because you get the head of radiology or the head of neurology comes down out of their busy schedule and really describes what the clinical problems are and how he or she might imagine biomedical engineering making a difference.
00:01:31.376 - 00:02:34.030, Speaker C: For example, we have Professor Rose, Eric Rose, who's the chairman of department of surgery at Columbia, and he's an internationally recognized cardiac surgeon. And he has done some major work with the left ventricular assistivites, which is a mechanical heart that is now being tested at the medical center. So we cover a very, very wide range of subjects, from cardiac surgeons to geneticists, orthopedic people to biomechanics to imaging is a big topic. And the way we're set up now is that we have a lecture, and then we break the class up into recitation sections, and we have some very excellent teaching assistants who help with that. The course is not quantitative. There's not a lot of math in it, but it's concept course. So in order to show that you understand the concept, you have to be able to explain it and explain it.
00:02:34.030 - 00:03:30.046, Speaker C: In this case, in writing. The work of the course is a paper, and I call it an essay on each topic that is presented in the class. Since I'm an editor of an online publication, biomedical engineering online, I am very aware of writing, and I tell our students I encourage them to write well, and a lot of them do write well. And I think it's important because that's the way they will communicate their engineering knowledge and their engineering outlook to the rest of the world. I think this would be a great way for the students to get an idea of what's going on in biomedical engineering and from those ideas, to decide if biomedical engineering is what they want to pursue do. Of course, actual pursuit of any career is nothing like being in the classroom and having somebody talk about it. It's not quite the same.
00:03:30.046 - 00:03:37.200, Speaker C: It's just one small factor in an overall picture of what the profession is.
