00:00:05.370 - 00:00:46.042, Speaker A: My name is Elisa Connofagu, and I'm associate professor in biomedical engineering with a joint appointment in radiology. I think Columbia is a unique place for bringing together clinicians and researchers in general. My lab and primary office are on the Columbia University medical campus that has help the research tremendously to have the support of physicians. I believe that ultrasound can do anything, so we develop a technique called harmonic motion imaging. We can actually detect the tumor, image it, and also ablate it. The idea is to basically replace surgery. So that's something that we're building and seems to be working so far.
00:00:46.042 - 00:01:39.590, Speaker A: We focus on cancer, and we focus on heart disease, and we also focus on neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These neurodegenerative diseases are under treated right now. The reason why they're being undertreated is because of the blood brain barrier. It's an extra barrier that only exists in the brain to filter toxins, everything that can be harmful to the brain. So we want to basically use ultrasound through the intact skull and skin to open the bladbrin barrier transiently, so reversibly in the region where it's needed. And then the idea is to use it in conjunction with systemically administered drugs that have been shown already to work, and they've been shelved because of the fact that they're not passing through the bladder barrier. Then we can actually, hopefully treat it early and reverse the disease.
00:01:39.590 - 00:01:45.180, Speaker A: It gets to the late stages. That's the ultimate objective. And.
