00:00:00.170 - 00:00:00.720, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.090 - 00:00:54.154, Speaker B: All software runs on hardware, and if the hardware is hacked, no amount of software based security measures help. Hacked hardware provides a foothold to breach virtually any computing system. Hardware manufacturing is a complex and global endeavor with many thousands of hands involved in the process. From the front end to the back end, each step is corruptible. Specification, design, implementation, manufacturing, testing and integration. Corruption in hardware manufacturing can be detected by comparing the output from the start with the output from the end. Thus, the front end is the root of trust for building secure systems.
00:00:54.154 - 00:01:31.034, Speaker B: Our lab is working on securing this allimportant route of trust to produce a trustworthy golden front end model, we implement the following three techniques. First, a static analysis technique is used to examine the blueprint for manufacturing. The key is to find wires that are not likely to be used often. These are likely malicious portions of the design and get tagged for a security engineer to examine. Imagine a city. The streets are busy, but the side streets are usually deserted. This is where the mischievous activity happens.
00:01:31.034 - 00:02:24.460, Speaker B: So once we find those areas, we are sure to check for trouble. To see how this works, consider a circuit with a hardware back door. When a unique malicious input is received, the output switches from the good circuit to the bad circuit. Since the wire connecting the bad circuit is only used with one specific input, our technique tags this wire as a source of possible corruption. To complement the first technique and to increase assurance, we develop a second technique called silencing hardware backdoor triggers to avoid being discovered during premanufactured testing, many backdoors do not trigger until a specific rare condition has been met in the field, for example, 1 billion cycles of operation. Hence, the backdoor is like a ticking time bomb. It is slowly getting closer to going off.
00:02:24.460 - 00:03:03.350, Speaker B: In this case, by frequently resetting the power to the circuit, the trigger condition is reset just as if the bomb fuse was reset to its original length. Using this technique, the trigger condition is never met and the back door never opens. The final technique is to build a monitoring system. This system runs continuously and verifies security properties. Think of hardware units as people kind. Kate wants to donate 100 to charity, so she gives it to the accountant, Eric. But evil Eric only gives 90 to the president, trusting Tony.
00:03:03.350 - 00:03:45.440, Speaker B: If Tony says to Kate, thanks for the $90, this alerts Kate to the fact that some of the money was stolen. If the units watch each other, they can recognize the threat. With these three techniques, we can have very high assurance that the front end of design process has not been corrupted and can be used to compare against the output of the back end. We have made a significant start towards building trustworthy hardware from untrustworthy parts, but a lot more needs to be done.
