00:00:06.240 - 00:00:27.619, Speaker A: Okay, I think we're ready to begin. So first I'd like to thank everybody for attending our event. And it's my great pleasure to have helped organize this event, but I'd like to definitely help. I'd like to thank the staff who helped make this event possible. So Christina Rome is our departmental events coordinator. Wasn't able to be here today. Alexis Newman and Antonia Farica.
00:00:27.619 - 00:00:54.431, Speaker A: Alexis, where is. There you are, over there. Give Alexis a big hand. So without these people, the event would not be possible. And also I'd like to thank our student volunteers, of which you've probably met several of them through the process of coming in here. I see one is there, and then there might be some others in the room or maybe they're all at the back. So our student volunteers will also be helping organize the tours and all the other parts of the event, which will be lots of fun.
00:00:54.431 - 00:00:56.075, Speaker A: So let's thank all of them again.
00:01:00.335 - 00:01:00.863, Speaker B: Okay.
00:01:00.919 - 00:01:44.635, Speaker A: So I was asked to acknowledge that this is traditional land of the Lenape people, and we appreciate that very much. And I was also asked to promote this QR code. So if you'd like to learn more about how Columbia engineering faculty are advancing the energy transition away from fossil fuels, please scan this QR code, which was made nice and small for you so you can zoom in there. And I think there are also cards out front, so it's a test of your phone's ability to get zoomed in there and take that picture. Okay, so now we're going to go to our opening remarks. And for this, I'd like to introduce an important person. That's the morrisonama Shapiro professor of Engineering at the Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Professor Shifu Chang.
00:01:50.065 - 00:02:13.393, Speaker B: All right, good afternoon, everyone. I'm Shifu Chen, Dean of Columbia Engineering School. So good to see everybody here join this wonderful event. This week we are joining the city to celebrate Climate Week nyc. And we have lectures and events at the Engineering school. Okay, okay. You don't have to look at the picture.
00:02:13.449 - 00:02:14.085, Speaker C: Okay.
00:02:15.965 - 00:03:04.497, Speaker B: And really wonderful. So many events and seminars and panels, including the exciting one here today in collaboration with our partners at the climate school, the Data Science Institute, as well as many industry partners here. And you can find the full schedule on the website. We are very excited about this panel, particularly today on commercial fusion, to discuss the role played by academia as well as industry and government and all different sectors. It's really compelling, timely topic. A lot of exciting discussion we had earlier already today, and really so much progress has been made in making commercial Fusion a reality, bringing it to the market today. And we can see success really depends on the collaboration and partnership among academia, industry and the government.
00:03:04.497 - 00:03:52.395, Speaker B: That's why today's discussion is extremely, extremely critical and relevant. Yesterday I had a chance to join a panel discussion to host a group of visitors from Southeast Asia who are extremely excited about the topic we have discussed today as well as other AI and quantum and cybersecurity. And in that discussion we were brainstorming and sharing idea what are the key concepts? And Peter to achieve successful partnership and innovation. And in conclusion I share three points of them. First is really the topic we are talking about today, private public partnership. And second is a talent development. You can see a lot of wonderful students here who have graduate from university leading a big institution or company or startup today.
00:03:52.395 - 00:04:47.237, Speaker B: And third one is really an open and vibrant environment and test bed and facility for collaboration and technology transfer. And that's what you're going to see part of the event today to have really a specialized tool to see our plasma lab. So I want to thank Professor Carlos Pas Soden for all the effort organizing the event today and also want to thank our panelists who really come from different sectors. Our last Carlo introduce them. But let me extend a special welcome to Alexis Bramson who is our incoming data colleague, dean of our wonderful climate school and we at engineering school many school at Columbia so excited about her arrival. There's so many opportunity for collaboration, faculty hire, joint lab and special program education. There's so many opportunities we can work together to accomplish our goal.
00:04:47.237 - 00:05:35.657, Speaker B: And let me also plug in a little bit introduction about our plasma physics lab. The lab you're going to see later today was co founded in 1962, is that right? By one of the former deans of Columbia Engineers Engineering, Robert A. Gross. He was one of the country's leading experts in fusion technology and he co founded a lab with another member of our faculty, Professor C.K. john Chu, an applied mathematician over the year has produced so many outstanding leaders. Many of you them are here and also led by our wonderful colleague Jerry nevertheless Mike Moore who are here today and also led by Carlos and also other faculty members today. So talent development is one of the three pillars as I mentioned in a successful innovation in key area.
00:05:35.657 - 00:05:45.245, Speaker B: So seeing our graduates, seeing the work they have done here made us so proud. So thank you for coming to the event and looking forward to further discussion today. Thank you Carlos. Thank you everyone.
00:05:52.445 - 00:06:20.959, Speaker A: Okay, thank you very much for those excellent remarks. I'd also like to thank our sponsors. So several of the members of our panel here come from the private sector. And so we graciously acknowledge their support to help make this event possible, including some of the things you'll see at the reception later on in the evening. Okay, so we'll just tell you a little bit about the agenda. So we're moving through the opening remarks right now. Between now and approximately 5 o'clock, we'll see exactly when we stop.
00:06:20.959 - 00:06:52.365, Speaker A: We'll have a panel discussion with our panelists that I'll introduce shortly. And then after that we have a tour of the plasma physics laboratory. So for that we'll split up into subgroups. Different students will lead those subgroups through the different areas of the lab. It's quite a large lab with many different rooms, so we'll have lots of time to see the different areas. And this is going to be leaving either from here or from the area and called the Mud Building, which is next door. And then after all that, we have a reception from 6 to 7 in what's called Carlton Commons.
00:06:52.365 - 00:07:07.333, Speaker A: It's as you enter the Mud building, which is next door, just go straight. That's going to be the Carlton Commons area. It's right on the, on this level, campus level. So yeah, that is our agenda. Now. I'll take, I'll have. It's my great pleasure to introduce the panelists.
00:07:07.333 - 00:07:37.641, Speaker A: So I'm not going to go through the bios. We're actually going to have the panelists introduce themselves, but I'll briefly, you know, just name them here. So we have Michael Ginsberg, who is the president of Tokamek Energy llc. Alexis Abramson was introduced by Dean Shu Fu Chang. This is the incoming dean of the Columbia Climate School and the current dean of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth. Michael Siegel is the senior director for Open Innovation at Commonwealth Fusion Systems. Charlie Baines Reid is the CFO and general counsel of Type 1 Energy.
00:07:37.641 - 00:08:01.325, Speaker A: Sam Wurtzel is the founder of Fusion Energy Base, which he'll tell you all about that. And Carrie Forrest is a professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin Madison and also a co founder and CTO of Realta Fusion. I think it's CSO if I'm not cso. Cso. Very good. So with that we'll, we'll take it to the panelists to further introduce themselves. And so the first question is an easy one for everyone.
00:08:01.325 - 00:08:16.987, Speaker A: It's just tell the audience a little bit about yourself. How did you get to where you are and all that. So maybe we'll just, we'll start at the back and then Work our way this way for this question with me. Yeah, hey, then we'll bounce back and forth.
00:08:17.171 - 00:08:51.815, Speaker D: Hello everyone. As Carlos said, I'm a professor at the University of Wisconsin and a co founder of Real Diffusion. So I'm wearing two hats and I think it's appropriate for today's session where we're discussing I have to wear both of those hats. I've been working in fusion probably longer than every buddy else at this table. I was started in the, in the late 80s. I went to graduate school and worked on a device, a concept perfusion called a tokamak. And we were playing with small fat tokamaks.
00:08:51.815 - 00:09:35.775, Speaker D: I built one in graduate school that, that had some nice results. Went to General Atomics San Diego where I got to know Mike and Jerry and we did some really nice work there. In the early 90s, mid-90s, ITER was taking off. This is a big project in the south of France which was going to be. It was initially initiated by Gorbachev and Reagan and it was a program which was going to make fusion happen in about 2017. And I was looking forward at my career thinking that is a long way away. And I'm a scientist, I like doing things that are interesting and there isn't enough to keep me interested between now and 2017.
00:09:35.775 - 00:09:56.675, Speaker D: So I went to the university, I started working in plasma astrophysics problems mostly. Still staying in fusion of course. And then something changed in the mid-2016, 2017, about when ITER would have been coming online. And there were three things that happened.
00:09:57.855 - 00:09:58.595, Speaker C: First.
00:10:00.975 - 00:10:50.925, Speaker D: There was some beautiful new results coming out of Russia on a very simple concept called a magnetic mirror. Second, a new generation of superconducting magnets was available to make very, very strong magnetic fields in the lab that could actually make the mirror work better. And the third thing, and I think that's the part for this here, is that there was a growing commercial appetite for fusion which made it look like the country was ready for fusion to invest and develop it. And that got us thinking at the university. This led to an ARPA E grant funded the construction of the first high temperature superconducting plasma experiment in the country. Just started operating by the way. And as part of their mission they asked us to commercialize the problem.
00:10:50.925 - 00:11:19.341, Speaker D: And so that led to a spin out, real diffusion came out of that. Several partnerships were formed. One was with Commonwealth Fusion, we wrote a joint grant. Commonwealth Fusion was a company that built the magnets that we are now using at the University of Wisconsin. And so, so that's a partnership that Forms straight away. Now, the gizmo that we run, it's called Wham. And it.
00:11:19.341 - 00:11:54.833, Speaker D: It's a partnership with Realta Fusion. Realta Fusion has led the fundraising, which now operates the experiment and. And provides, you know, provides a grant, if you will, to keep the. Keep the work going under their terms, very direct. Make sure that we keep focused on the end goal and that partnership, it's going. And so those are several examples of partnerships that are there between academia and industry. And I think this time is very exciting because those things are possible.
00:11:54.833 - 00:11:58.165, Speaker D: That's me. Sorry, that was probably too long. I'm sorry. Yeah, okay.
00:11:59.305 - 00:12:02.085, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll just go down the table.
00:12:04.795 - 00:12:31.603, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Michael Siegel. I'm director of Open Innovation at Commonwealth Fusion Systems. First of all, I want to thank Carlos and the organizers for putting this together. It's remarkable and rewarding and amazing to see fusion show up in forums like this, at institutions like this more and more every year. I think people are understanding the promise of fusion. They're getting excited. The energy transition is a phrase we hear a lot of.
00:12:31.603 - 00:13:00.705, Speaker C: But if you think about what's a downstream of energy, it's everything. And we have a value in CFS that posits that the two fundamental inputs are creativity and energy into any human system. And so think about what we can do when bottlenecks around energy are lifted. Right? So it's a very, very exciting time. And we think about fusion as an energy source for the next 10,000 years. Right. And that transition is happening now during our lifetimes, during these years.
00:13:00.705 - 00:13:48.229, Speaker C: And so to say a little bit about myself after that, so I'm a research scientist turned sort of communicator turned ecosystem builder inside fusion. Fusion has always been sort of the city on the hill for engineering physicists like myself. Because of its impact, it's just really hard to think about what else has the potential impact. I started graduate School in 2001, so the performance of fusion can be judged by what we call the triple product. It's basically, how good are you at fusion right now? And it was accelerating very, very quickly. Faster than Moore's Law, decade after decade after decade. From the 50s and around the late 90s, early 2000s, it stopped, it flatlined.
00:13:48.229 - 00:14:33.229, Speaker C: And that's when I showed up in grad school and I poked around the fusion center and I didn't know what was happening. It was hard to tell what the direction was. So I studied else. I had a career in something else. But fusion was always something that I sort of had sort of bookmarked and was kind of a North Star. And actually, you know, it was, it was actually YouTube. It was, it was the emergence of high temperature superconducting magnets and the YouTube lecture series by Dennis White at the Plasma Science Infusion center at MIT that made me realize, oh, okay, so this is how it's going to happen, right? This is before CFS was a company and I paid attention, I rewatched it, I watched this other video.
00:14:33.229 - 00:15:01.395, Speaker C: And when they became a company and they raised a little bit of money, they had a very basic kind of like MySpace type webpage. And I found a place to enter into a text field that I want to work there. So that's how we started. And I was one of the first lucky enough to be one of the first sort of 10 hires. And for them to hire a partnerships person in the first 10, I think directly speaks to just how important partnerships are. Right. The collection of capabilities that will make fusion a success are everywhere.
00:15:01.395 - 00:15:13.635, Speaker C: And now more than ever, we need to understand how to work together with public programs to accelerate what we need to do, which is to get fusion on the grid in the next 10 to 15 years. So very pleased to be here.
00:15:16.095 - 00:15:49.867, Speaker E: My name is Sam Wurzel and I'm working on a website right now called Fusion Energy Base. But the story starts, yeah, 20 years ago. I was in graduate school as well. I was working on a field reverse configuration configuration device at the University of Colorado at Boulder. And at the time, like Michael was alluding to, it was pretty grim period for fusion. And the funding for non tokamak concepts at the time was pretty bad. And I decided to quit grad school before I really finished.
00:15:49.867 - 00:16:39.895, Speaker E: And I moved out to the Bay Area and got involved with software. And it's a pretty common story quitting physics grad school and doing software. And I did that for about 15 years and it was great. The whole time though, I was thinking about fusion and I would kind of Google Fusion, see what was going on. And then around 2016, I saw that there were a couple small fusion startup companies which totally blew my mind. So I bought a ticket to the American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics meeting, which was in Milwaukee I think that year, and just showed up and kind of reconnected with the plasma physics community. A couple of people that still remembered me and, and I also, I had been involved in startups and software startups and so I thought maybe I could kind of connect those two things.
00:16:39.895 - 00:17:08.079, Speaker E: And I saw that people were usually thinking about investing in fusion companies, which seemed totally crazy. And I realized I had this memory of this concept called the Lawson Criterion. And I started aggregating data on the triple product. And then I ended up writing a paper about it with Scott Hsu, who is at ARPA E. ARPA E is an agency at the U.S. department of Energy that funds applied research in high risk, high reward areas. And through that, I ended up joining ARPA E.
00:17:08.079 - 00:17:19.355, Speaker E: And I recently left ARPA E in April. And since then I've been continuing this effort to help improve the data around fusion so that folks can get a sense of what's going on and make better decisions.
00:17:21.544 - 00:17:55.525, Speaker F: So. Afternoon, everyone. Charlie Baines, Reid. Thank you again to Carlos and the team of volunteers and staff for putting this together. I am General Counsel and CFO at Type 1 Energy. My journey to fusion was a little circuitous, but I started life as a corporate finance M and a lawyer doing international corporate finance in the uk, Japan, and then Australia. And then in Australia, I joined Macquarie Capital, which some people may know is a Australian investment bank primarily focused on infrastructure.
00:17:55.525 - 00:18:42.839, Speaker F: And through those efforts got to work on a number of sustainability and renewable energy projects, both in Australia and then after moving to the US in 2007, after about seven years there, I left to pursue some independent deals with a couple of partners. And through those efforts, I was first introduced to fusion about five years ago. Some members of the type 1 team with a. With a prior company, we were looking at alternative funding mechanics for fusion and to make fusion a reality. And, you know, being a relatively new father at the time, I was very excited by the possibility. I hadn't realized that fusion was at this, this tipping point where it really could be seen, you know, a credible pathway to commercialization. So I was very excited, stayed close to the team.
00:18:42.839 - 00:19:48.177, Speaker F: And then after type 1 energy received its first institutional funding at the beginning of last year, was asked to join the team. And frankly, the thing that struck me both with the fusion industry generally with Type 1 as an organization, with a number of the academic institutions, is I think there's an urgency around fusion, which is born out of necessity. I think we all recognize the challenges that we face, you know, on a humanitarian level with energy supply, energy security, energy justice. And I think that, you know, if you look at the data and you look at what the future could look like without fusion, it's, you know, it can be a little bit scary now. I think what's important is there are a lot of incredibly smart people and a lot of very motivated people who are now collaborating across industry, across financing, across investor base. And across academia to, to really push things forward in a way that's, that's somewhat unprecedented. So I think it's a very exciting time to be part of this opportunity.
00:19:48.177 - 00:20:08.495, Speaker F: I think it's broader than simply the fusion companies that will build, you know, the machines. I think there's an entire ecosystem and supply chain that needs to develop in parallel. And I think the collaboration and the opportunities for people to get involved across that ecosystem are really exciting. So, looking forward to the rest of the conversation.
00:20:11.595 - 00:20:57.875, Speaker G: Well, thanks again Carlos and everyone at Columbia. Michael Ginsberg. So I have had a similarly to yourself circuitous path to fusion. Both myself sort of driven to figuring out solutions to the energy transition, both in academia as well as in the private sector. I actually started my career working on solar plants and solar projects in the early 2000s when it was uneconomical to do solar. Led me to a career building everything from micro grid plants to utility scale solar projects and then back to Columbia University where I did my master's and doctorate. My advisor happens to be in the room as well.
00:20:57.875 - 00:21:43.665, Speaker G: And so studying, studying utility scale solar. How do we increase the penetration of variable renewable energy? That brought me into hydrogen, where I did my doctorate and ended up working at a startup. I was the first employee of a green hydrogen startup for several years where I was building renewable hydrogen plants. And so doing that, getting that experience led me to realize that, you know, there is no slowing in energy demand. And so there's tremendous challenge ahead of us. And so I wanted to leverage that experience and do what I could to bridge this gap from, you know, lab all the way through to commercialization. And the fusion industry is at a very exciting time.
00:21:43.665 - 00:22:19.305, Speaker G: And so I joined Tokamak Energy about a year ago now because I realized that this company had a real history and pedigree operating, you know, its own Tokamax Verkel Tokamak since about 10 years now spin off of the UK government. And it's been a real honor to really expand into the US leveraging our relationships with the national labs, working closely with Princeton Plasma Physics Lab as well as Oak Ridge National Lab and now under the milestone program. So it's really a very exciting time to be in this industry.
00:22:23.805 - 00:23:02.175, Speaker H: Good afternoon everybody. I'm Alexis Abramson. As you heard earlier in January, I will be starting as dean of the Climate School here at Columbia. And I'm very excited about that. While I've been an academic for about 20 plus years now, I've kind of also taken sort of a more circuitous path. I've I'm a mechanical engineer by training. I've been working in the area of energy, materials and energy efficiency for a while, as well as looking at grid and the future of the grid.
00:23:02.175 - 00:24:44.195, Speaker H: I ran an energy institute institute previously, and I'm currently, just for a couple more months, the dean of engineering at Dartmouth College. But because my research, my scholarship, plus a lot of the work that I've done has been in energy and sustainability and climate, fusion actually has always been part of the mix of technologies that I've looked at and been intrigued about and kind of kept up with and really have been fascinated over the last five years or so to see just the explosion in the number of companies and the capabilities and the scientific achievements. So that's been wonderful to see. I did spend a couple of years at the Department of Energy working as a chief scientist there, and then also did a sabbatical at Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which is a funder of a few different fusion companies, including those at the table. And so have been engaged in looking at fusion and really understanding the commercialization opportunities of fusion. And then I will also say with an eye toward engineering, but not just engineering, but understanding how many other disciplines, particularly as we think about the real application of fusion globally, thinking about the intersection across a lot of other disciplines, even outside the science community, including the business side of things, the policy side of things, the anthropology side of things. And so I'm really excited to be part of the panel.
00:24:44.575 - 00:25:10.345, Speaker A: Okay, thank you all very much. So I think I might target this one question only to Sam Wurcel in the interest of time, mostly to move on to the industry part of the panel. But so, Sam, just in your personal opinion, what is the potential impact of fusion for the climate program and for the climate problem, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of the technology, broadly speaking?
00:25:11.365 - 00:25:51.859, Speaker E: Well, I think that Michael alluded to this in his earlier comments. I mean, fusion is the ultimate energy source. It has the potential to be a firm, dense form of primary energy that can scale. And the biggest downside to fusion is that it doesn't work yet. And that's also why it's one of the most exciting, because there's huge opportunity. I think that in the future, fusion has that opportunity to be. To make a huge impact in climate.
00:25:51.859 - 00:26:13.585, Speaker E: Is it the only one? No. I think that you'll find that people involved in fusion tend to be fans of fission. We could. We could build a lot of fission. I think we should. But fusion is. It's exciting because the fuel is abundant.
00:26:13.585 - 00:26:45.505, Speaker E: It's the way Stars make energy. I mean, there's all kinds of, it's intellectually interesting. There's all kinds of interesting physics. So I think it pushes a lot of buttons of physicists and people on the, that are academically interested in, have been for a long time. But I think there's the shift that's happening now where there are a limited number of forms of primary energy and fusion is one of them. Primary energy. When I say primary energy, I mean ways that we get energy from nature and make it useful for, for us.
00:26:45.505 - 00:27:18.075, Speaker E: And, and because there's a small number of them, I think it's just so important to really try to push each one, especially ones that don't make carbon, put carbon to the atmosphere. So that's the excitement. The potential is totally unbounded. I think that if we, even beyond climate issues, if we want to take humanity and even move it off the planet and explore the universe into the 22nd century and beyond, I think fusion will be a big part of that.
00:27:19.065 - 00:27:50.905, Speaker A: Okay, so I will let others chime in on that question in the context of the next question if they want. So this one is more focused on the industry panelists. So I'd like to hear from the industry members for your company. You know, describe your vision for your company and what is the secret sauce that's going to make your concept be the one that gets us? Or do you think, oh yeah, what, what's the, what's your secret sauce? To the degree you can tell it. We'll start on this side this time. So I think Michael is the first at that.
00:27:51.525 - 00:28:25.585, Speaker G: Sounds good. So I think for us, actually very similar to the way that Michael answered this. What has changed in the last decade or 15 years around fusion? So our company was founded on the idea of the spherical tokamak design. It was something that was incubated at the UK Atomic Energy Authority in the early 2000s, late 1990s. A couple of physicists said, we want to do this faster. So they went ahead and started their own company, raised enough money to then build their own spherical tokamaks. So they built two of them.
00:28:25.585 - 00:29:13.617, Speaker G: So I think what they realized quickly was that they needed to develop high temperature superconductors that could withstand tremendous current without losing that superconductivity, what's called quenching. And so that is a technology that we've invested in and we've worked on for over a decade now. It not only has applications in fusion, but also outside of fusion. There's tremendous advantages in other industries that hts magnets can leverage. But for us, we see HTS as the biggest enabler. That coupled with a spherical design, because magnets actually are the largest portion of capex when it comes to the overnight cost. So because of our design, we use less magnets.
00:29:13.617 - 00:29:29.565, Speaker G: We believe we have improved physics performance due to something that's called bootstrap current. So we can leverage more of that current back into our process. So those two things coupled together is really the basis of our design and our strategy technically around fusion.
00:29:32.265 - 00:30:10.915, Speaker F: So from our perspective, Type 1 Energy is using a stellarator design. In fact, Thomas M. Peterson, for whom I am a, a very poor substitute who was hoping to be on the panel today as a Columbia alum, one of his stellarators is still here. Carlos did tell me that they've improved on it significantly since Thomas left. But I think the importance for us is what we're fundamentally doing is taking the architecture of the W7X stellarator and we're looking to optimize that. So we're not looking to reinvent or try and do something different. And I think to the point you just made the excitement and the ability to make fusion a reality.
00:30:10.915 - 00:31:18.075, Speaker F: I mean, as someone pointed out on a, on a panel I was on yesterday, you know, fusion's actually the, you know, it's a very new technology, but the oldest and most prominent form of energy in the universe. So this is something we should be able to solve for. And I think the interesting thing is, you know, the maturation of certain enabling technologies, whether that be specialty materials, high temperature superconducting magnets, additive manufacturing, quantum, you know, exascale computing has allowed us to solve four elements of this. You know, obviously fusion has. People have been talking about fusion as an energy source, you know, for 70 plus years. So what we're looking to do, and I think this goes to the core of what's being discussed here, is we're trying to have a very partner rich, capital efficient strategy which relies very heavily on taking best in class partners with multiple aspects of the total architecture required for a fusion power plant. And we're looking to then optimize an existing design in the W7X architecture rather than trying to do something that hasn't been done before.
00:31:18.075 - 00:31:50.055, Speaker F: I think one of the things to point out as well is as an industry, I think one of the strengths for fusion is the fact that the collaboration across the industry amongst multiple companies is actually something to be embraced and, and enjoyed because this is such a huge opportunity that there's, you know, there's a place for multiple people to win here. So this is not sort of a race to be first necessarily. This is, you know, a way to hopefully bring the entire industry and the entire ecosystem along together.
00:31:54.995 - 00:32:20.407, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for the question. I just want to briefly actually add something Sam said about why fusion exciting, which I've always found terrifying and talk about inside cfs, which is you can think about fusion as manufacturing energy rather than scavenging. So this, this is, you know, maybe we need to chew on this for a little bit. But basically, instead of going and finding the sunny spot, the winter spot, spot.
00:32:20.431 - 00:32:22.743, Speaker E: With oil, spot with coal, spot with.
00:32:22.879 - 00:33:01.869, Speaker C: You know, fission fuel, if you have a ubiquitous abundance and next to free fuel source, it is manufactured as needed, where needed. Right. And this is, this is actually hard to wrap your mind. I've been thinking about it for years and it's, it's, it's. I think it in a nutshell, it kind of encapsulates why fusion is so transformative and exciting. On the, on the question of sort of CFS and other companies and our approach to fusion, I think maybe it's fair to say another panelist should disagree with me if they do. But it's fair to say that in some way all the fusion companies are trying to solve a variant of the same problem, which is, is how do you stop building bigger and bigger devices? Right.
00:33:01.869 - 00:33:47.405, Speaker C: So why did the, you know, the triple product, which I mentioned earlier, why did fusion sort of Plateau in the late 90s, early 2000s, is because to get to the next performance node, you had to build a bigger and bigger and bigger device. And so the device that people agreed to build was here, right, the experiment in south of France. It's a, you know, estimates vary, 30 to $60 billion device, decades long to put together, really a remarkable feat of human cooperation and ingenuity. But when we look at the timelines, I think has decided to bite off a different part of the risk profile. I'll start again from the very beginning. Thank you. Red, green.
00:33:47.405 - 00:34:14.031, Speaker C: Yeah. So I, so I think each company is biting off a different part of the risk profile. Right. So you can think of CFS as attacking the part of the risk balance where we minimize physics risk by using the most understood, the most built and most traditional fusion device design, which is a tokamak. There have been around 200 built. It's very well understood. Iter is a tokamak.
00:34:14.031 - 00:35:16.525, Speaker C: We basically reproduce a lot of the physics of Iter in a much smaller device. And we put a lot of risk into the engineering and execution bucket by building Enormously strong, physically large magnets that allow for a much better confinement and allow for a much smaller device and a much quicker and cheaper device to build. And so, you know, different companies have attacked the problem of how to build quickly and small in different ways. And some have bitten off more of a physics risk. And if they win on this particular physics problem that they've, you know, that they're challenging, they're going to have this incredibly rapid ramp on some of these other execution engineering ideas. And so, you know, CFS when I started it was five or 10 people around a co working space with a different company behind us, another one in front of us. What it's like now to show up to work is there's so many manufacturing engineers and technicians with three shifts on our magnet line, but there's nowhere to park.
00:35:16.525 - 00:36:00.039, Speaker C: We are a magnet manufacturing company, we're a construction company. We're building a device called Spark. Spark will be the first commercially relevant net energy device. It's going to turn on in about two years. So this is very, very near term and the company is overwhelmingly focused on taking this very well understood from a physics perspective object and adding in this transformational energy technology which others have talked about as well, to make that a possibility on timescales that wouldn't otherwise be possible. And we've always been very, very open and we have partnerships across the industry. We actually offer a variant of sort of a magnet design manufacturer as a service.
00:36:00.039 - 00:36:09.275, Speaker C: We want to see the tide lift all boats. We want to see fusion get on the menu and be a viable option for different markets and different companies in different geographies.
00:36:13.585 - 00:36:54.189, Speaker D: There are many common themes here. We also have chosen a particular risk. We have a little bit more physics risk on a topic that has gone out of fashion for about the last 40 years. In the 50s and 60s and early 70s, the magnetic mirror was one of the leading concepts. In fact, it had the first fusion relevant ion temperatures that were that were needed. It reached it, it showed that classical confinement behaves as expected. It had some problems and the tokamak was in the ascendancy.
00:36:54.189 - 00:37:43.843, Speaker D: And the US program focused in about 1986 and the program was terminated in part because it was ahead of its time. There weren't magnets that were available to build what we needed to do. And so fast forward to today when we have fusion, we're going to need it to be on all the time. It's going to have to be reliable, it's going to have to be available, we're going to need to be Able to perform maintenance and do things to, and build the devices in a straightforward way. And one of the problems, it's not just that the experiments are big, it's also that they're extremely complicated to build. We are building gizmos which have lots of linkages that you can design for one size and then you turn, turn them on and they break. And it takes a decade to recover from breaking.
00:37:43.843 - 00:38:18.035, Speaker D: There's an experiment south of here, about 60 miles. It's taken a long time to come back from a large accident. And it's a demonstration of how technically difficult it is to build these things. So our concept is much simpler. It's basically a sausage shaped or a Tootsie Roll shaped take linear plasma, you could build it on a railroad track. And in the middle are MRI class magnets. So sort of three tesla magnets, one you can, you know, see in the hospital, something about that size.
00:38:18.035 - 00:39:06.245, Speaker D: And at the ends we have two very, very high technology, very high field magnets that plug it, squeezing off the Tootsie Roll where the plasma has a hard time coming through and going out. So because of the geometry, it's easy to assemble, it's easy to iterate. We can move faster on the, on the science side to demonstrate the things which need to get done. In the end, we only need two, maybe four of these very, very high field magnets. While Tokamax might be 18 and on a Stellarator you might have 40 of them or some large number. And so we reduce the number of magnets that are needed. These very high field magnets makes it simpler, makes it more inspectable, more reliable, ultimately lower cost and faster.
00:39:07.865 - 00:39:55.691, Speaker A: Okay, thank you all very much for that question. So now we're going to go into a little bit of a fantasy land just for this question. So just for the benefit of the audience, most of the companies are working towards, or at least have in their vision something called a pilot plant, which is not necessarily a commercially profitable facility, but it's a place, a facility where you demonstrate that you have put all the pieces together and you have an engineered system that can deliver electricity to the grid. So that's to zero order. What's considered this pilot plant in the world of fission? This was done by a place called Shippingport that was a private, public, private partnership. And there's some possibility that the pilot plant may manifest as a public, public, private partnership also. We'll get to that in a second.
00:39:55.691 - 00:40:34.875, Speaker A: But so my question now is on timeline and I'm going to give you a fantasy card because I'm going to allow you sufficient money to get the job done and sufficient talent to get the job done. So if you had sufficient money and sufficient talent, what timeline do you think you could construct a pilot plant based on the technologies you're pursuing? And as a follow up, given a more realistic assessment of funding and talent constraints, how does that change the timeline for the pilot plan? So we're not talking about penetration into the electricity market, but we're talking about a single demonstration. And I think we get to go backwards in the other direction this time.
00:40:36.015 - 00:41:46.365, Speaker D: I can. So our pilot plant concept has just come together formally on the company side during the last year and we have past one of our milestones within a public private partnership that's operated by the Department of Energy which shows, which is a reactor concept that we think we could be ready to start constructing in about a decade. And on the way to get there, we would like to be starting the operation of a single machine in between now and then which demonstrates the full size magnets that will be used in the first of a kind power plant, but only one end of the system. And if we can show that the performance is as expected by theory and our models on that system, this would be done in about five years. So we think it's a two step process. There's a lot to do between now and then. And this would be the start of a pilot plant in 10 years.
00:41:52.425 - 00:42:43.345, Speaker C: Yeah, so Kerry mentioned milestone and Carlos mentioned milestone. So this is a, you know, I think we might have a question in the future about this. But it's a, it's a DOE program that basically allows companies to define their own sort of like signposts along the road and say that if we pass the signpost, let's pre negotiate a reimbursement for certain costs that the company will get from the government if we, if we get that work done. And you know the, there are eight winners and basically the timelines for all eight winners in the program are quite similar. It's about a five year program. By the end of the program we all have to have a construction ready design and the program started. You know, depending on how you count as we can, we can talk about that, you know, this year or last year.
00:42:43.345 - 00:43:37.475, Speaker C: And so we're talking about, you know, 28, 29, maybe 30 for there to be eight construction ready pilot plant designs. In the case of CFS and I believe in the case of most of the milestone winners we plan to deploy in the early 30s. And you know, it's, it's a. Carlos It's a great question you ask about the fantasyland version. And I kind of just, I'm, I'm tempted to just almost beg the question, which is, you know, we kind of are in a fancy land where, you know, just 20 years ago, you know, the canonical power plant device was something called demo, which was supposed to be deployed in the 50s, 60s or 70s. And so it was a very much receding horizon kind of device. We now have a growing alignment both in governments and in private companies around the early 30s as a deployment deadline.
00:43:37.475 - 00:44:28.929, Speaker C: So we see the US government funding significant programs around those timelines. We see Japan, Korea, we see Germany, we see UK AA and the UK increasingly moving up. Some of them are maybe 40s, but if you actually look a little bit closer, they're actually late 30s and mid-30s. So we're in a remarkable time period where, you know, I almost want to be careful about asking for more, and we certainly can. And I think more funding and more public private partnerships and an, you know, accelerated and greater focus on fusion and universities in particular, I think would be a tremendous help. But you know, we're also seeing a funding landscape where for every public dollar that's gone into fusion, there's about now one private dollar that's gone into fusion in the United States on an annualized basis. This is a dramatic transformation and is going to accelerate.
00:44:28.929 - 00:44:38.045, Speaker C: So we are really very fortunate to be where we are and to be in this position where we can seriously discuss deploying fusion power to the grid by the early 30s.
00:44:43.185 - 00:45:17.593, Speaker F: I agree, everything that's being said is absolutely correct. I think in a fantasy land. I think we were talking about this beforehand and we should be cognizant of the fact that the Chinese at the moment are, are somewhat taking this approach. If we had given where we are today a Manhattan style project of just a force multiplier in terms of capital and human capital to achieve this. I think we could, we could accelerate the timeline on certain key aspects. But we already have ambitious timelines and I don't think any of us are slowing down. You know, I think there's been a demonstrable change.
00:45:17.593 - 00:46:00.769, Speaker F: Oh, wow, that's. Should I start singing or is this, this is the romantic portion of the. I think there's, you know, there's, there's a real opportunity here. We would obviously like to accelerate things. We'd like to have more capacity, but I think we can achieve still pretty incredible things and pretty aggressive timelines with what we have available. I think, you know, the capital, a greater proportion of Capital, you know, appropriation of capital from the US Government wouldn't, wouldn't go amiss, so we won't turn our nose up at that. I think one of the other things that we're working very hard to do with certain partners is to make sure that the supply chain doesn't become the bottleneck.
00:46:00.769 - 00:46:47.435, Speaker F: I think that's going to be critical for everyone. And so I think a lot of capital needs to go into that as well in terms of not only the capital, but just operationalizing a number of those businesses and making sure they're mature enough to handle what is going to be required. Thank you. But overall, it's an exciting time. And I think one of the things that's been interesting for me is in the last four or five years just seeing the fundamental shift in the attitude of private capital. And I think part of the narrative and part of the thing we can do to help continue to encourage that is not to talk about fusion in terms of solving the climate challenge, but actually solving for the energy challenge. Because the amount of energy that we need on a global scale is increasing at a phenomenal rate.
00:46:47.435 - 00:47:12.515, Speaker F: You know, estimates of four times the energy required today is going to be required within 10 years. Now, if you start to talk to people, including oil companies and others, about the energy need and the financial opportunity from just the sheer volume of energy that's going to be required with the climate being a very, very pleasant side effect, I think you can start to get engagement at a different level with a broader group of investors.
00:47:16.015 - 00:47:51.399, Speaker G: Yeah, I think my colleagues have addressed this question very well. I think I would add to this. Am I going to be the one to say it at this, at this occasion? We always say there's a bold decadal vision that requires a bold decadal budget. It's sort of the talking point on the Hill, I think, that all of us share. But my point is, as a matter of fact, I think about this all the time. What would we do with that money and what is required now? You know, I think that gradually we are resolving a lot of the physics questions. There are some that still remain, for sure, but we're increasingly in the realm of engineering problems.
00:47:51.399 - 00:48:50.905, Speaker G: And so that capital could really accelerate. You know, things like, you know, neutron resistant, radiation resistant materials, that is going to require some accelerated testing. We, I think, all have this kind of, this discussion with a lot of our partners is how do we convince major supply chain companies to invest their own capital into this, into this industry? And so I think that that capital could really Help build out that supply chain of materials that are going to be needed to realize this. You know, I spent most of my career about 15 years developing physical projects. I recognize that even on off the shelf commercial technologies require EPCs, engineering procurement, construction firms, and we need to bring those companies in now and educate them. So it's not a linear process, especially with fusion. It is a parallel process where we need to engage and separate the technical risk from the physical risk with these projects.
00:48:52.165 - 00:49:14.685, Speaker A: Okay, thank you all for that response. And so now we'll turn back to primarily the non industry participants. But although the industry participants can respond if they like. So I'd like to, you know, put on the hat of the venture capitalist or the investor and see what, what are they thinking about in this space? What's their motivation for getting in an early stage with this, with these concepts. And we'll start with.
00:49:16.905 - 00:49:59.525, Speaker H: Sure, yeah. If you, if you look at the total dollar spent, and I might get this a little bit wrong, Right. I heard globally the investment in fusion is around 7 billion or so. Maybe about half or so comes from private investment and about half from government investment. That's a pretty significant number of billions of dollars. If you just look at even the solar industry alone, the wind industry alone, there's risk and there's always risk, but they're certainly not the kind of investment that has gone into those areas now. They're not as complex as fusion.
00:49:59.525 - 00:51:03.535, Speaker H: So I understand that. But really, I think that the motivation from investors, and I was part of this when I was at a venture capital firm, is the holy grail of it all of that fusion. I mean, our lives globally will be significantly changed if we can achieve what you're hearing about today. About 45 or so startup companies are out there doing fusion. They won't all make it. I think there will be partnerships that will be formed because you're hearing it here, right? There's such amazing talent and discoveries that have happened that a magnet from one company and a design from another company coming together will be encouraged more and more as a way to leverage those investments even even further. So I think it's really, you know, the motivation here has largely to do with sort of that, that holy grail opportunity.
00:51:08.875 - 00:51:10.575, Speaker A: Michael, you want to get in on this one?
00:51:11.115 - 00:51:44.081, Speaker G: Yeah. I also think about this quite a bit and speak to a lot of investors in my role. And I think that there's, there's different motivations. You know, we as a company were, were founded by folks who had this aspiration and they convinced people who were high net worth individuals to get involved. Back in 2009 timeframe, I think we're starting to talk to oil and gas companies around major investments that could be really transformational. And they start to see that fusion is relevant for energy transition. That's when it goes from millions to billions.
00:51:44.081 - 00:52:27.275, Speaker G: Separately, I think there's the value of the subsystem or incremental technologies on the path to fusion and there's commercialization opportunities. So no longer is it a 20, 30 year time horizon. You know, in our current series C round, we're diversifying our investor base beyond the high net worth individuals to supply chain partners. So for instance, Furukawa is one of the tape manufacturers that goes into those high temperature superconductors. So they're a new investor. We're excited by this because it brings a realism and maturity into this industry and being able to, you know, finance your own activities off of your balance sheet, less dependent on the successive capital raise.
00:52:29.855 - 00:53:15.675, Speaker E: I'll just say one other thing. On the investment side, it's just worth thinking about the scale of the opportunity. Energy is I think the biggest market in the world because everything is downstream of energy. Food, manufacturing, transportation, everything takes energy. Making this water bottle took a lot of energy. And when the investors think about that opportunity, they say to themselves, well, if this works out, if one of these companies starts scaling out, these are, these can easily, easily be trillion dollar plus companies. And while the probability of an individual company might be low, there are investors that are putting together baskets of, of investments in baskets of fusion companies.
00:53:15.675 - 00:53:49.245, Speaker E: And it's not just venture capital, but it's getting to financial firms, oil that will make much larger investments, or oil and gas companies, sovereign wealth funds which are investing the capital and the wealth of countries. And there are strategic reasons why countries would want to have electricity from fusion energy. So the investor base is broadening and the opportunity is potentially unbounded. That's why you're seeing this growing interest.
00:53:51.785 - 00:54:29.645, Speaker C: I'll just quickly add to what Sam said, which is in addition to the size of the opportunity, there's also a heartbeat of achievement from the community. So there was a net energy achievement in a laser experiment called NIF that demonstrated some of the physics that we all care about. There is a magnet demonstration by CFS and MIT that demonstrated some of the enabling technologies. And so, you know, as a community we're going to keep this heartbeat up. And so we're going to show progress technologically towards our goals and show that we're mature enough to take advantage of this opportunity.
00:54:31.635 - 00:55:06.105, Speaker A: Okay, so now let's turn the conversation over to partnerships, and partnerships in particular with academia. So maybe the first version of this question will be to talk about your engagement from the private company side with the DOE Milestone program, and in particular to focus the question on what you're doing with your academic partners in the DOE milestone program. So maybe whoever gets the first at bat can. We already heard a little bit about the milestone program, but you can maybe just review the key points about it and then what you're doing with your partners. And I think it's to that side of the table, you can take it however you like.
00:55:07.365 - 00:55:44.365, Speaker D: Yeah. So as I alluded to earlier, we founded, we had a concept at the University of Wisconsin. I'm wearing my professor hat at this moment. And we applied for funding through ARPA E and received a very large award to build a wonderful new magnetic mirror at the University of Wisconsin. That was 2020. It spun out about two years later. We had gone through, we had some patents.
00:55:44.365 - 00:56:49.607, Speaker D: We were meeting with our tech transfer offices at the university. ARPA E had a requirement on us that we developed tech to market plan and that one thing led to another and we had the idea of what a company might look like and we incorporated the actual incorporation date. We were going to incorporate anyway, but the incorporation date in part was set by the opportunity of applying to the milestone program. So we were a very, very early stage startup for this program and we were getting our stuff together and in the, you know, the timing was perfect for applying to the milestone program. We were successful at getting that money or getting that award. It took a long time for the program to actually work through the details of how the money would come to the company, what the legal constraints would be and so forth. And eventually, just this year, it started to go forward.
00:56:49.607 - 00:57:27.645, Speaker D: So the company is going to receive reimbursements for milestones that are as mundane as just getting set up as a company and getting purchasing orders, purchasing departments in place and stuff of that nature. But then there are technical milestones which are really driving it. And we've just met our first couple. The university is very much involved in that too, because the research, the development is being done mostly on the university side with the hardware at this moment that will transition with.
00:57:33.185 - 00:58:41.447, Speaker C: Yeah, so we have relationships with multiple, you know, university and national lab partners as part of our milestone program, which I think is true for most of the milestone winners. I think, you know, what's important for us as well is what milestone does for the relationship with the DOE itself. It's Really a data point that's very vital for our conversations with entire public program because what it does is it describes a fusion power plant as a private initiative. So as we're in this kind of transition point and tipping point between primarily public funded device programs and primarily private funded device programs, we are trying to find our swim lanes and trying to find how we can be complementary to each other and work together. And Milestone is absolutely vital because in each of these interactions, you know, we can come to our partners and say, listen, we're taking risks that you would never take, that you would never want to take. We are, we are building before we know our core technology works. We're jumping in with two feet.
00:58:41.447 - 00:59:20.095, Speaker C: We're doing all this product definition and customer interaction. What we need from you is basic science test stands and workforce development and training. And that's why universities are so important, is because, you know, national labs cannot produce graduates and we need to hire tens of thousands of fusion workers by the mid-30s. And so the more that we understand our respective capabilities and risk profiles and our interactions, the faster we're all going to go. And, you know, given the size of the opportunity that's been described, there will be plenty to go around. This is not a zero sum game. And so milestone is an incredible data point.
00:59:20.095 - 00:59:59.485, Speaker C: It's also a validation for each of the companies that has won. Right? So we go from 45, 50 companies globally, 20 or 30 some in the United States, to having eight that have engaged in this very rigorous process with the doe. And the DOE is saying, we're actually putting money behind these eight companies. Right? And so again, it changes sort of how the public perceives the companies, how the public perceives the roles of the DOE and the private companies. So, so in addition to the financial reimbursement, which is valuable to all eight winners, you know, each partnership is a conversation about how we work together. And that's really an important part of what we're doing.
01:00:01.825 - 01:01:14.005, Speaker E: Maybe I'll just say a little bit about the background of the milestone program, what it is, where it came from, and it's something I was involved in while I was at DOE. So the Energy act of 2020 is a law that was passed by Congress. And in that very long law there is a section and it talks about expanding the role of fusion energy sciences to support the establishment, not just a fusion science, but to establish a competitive and robust fusion industry in the United States. And I'm paraphrasing a bit, but one of the really the flagship program and effort to push that along is the Milestone Based Fusion Development Program, which is out of the doe and it was modeled. And as we were thinking about it while I was at doe, we looked at programs like the NASA COTS program that came out of NASA. And this is a program that was established when NASA realized that Space Shuttle was going to go away. And they wanted to engage private industry for supporting getting things to the ISS into orbit.
01:01:14.005 - 01:02:05.275, Speaker E: And they said, okay, we're going to put a whole bunch of money to a public program to build the Space Launch System, but we're going to take a little bit of money and let private companies come and come up with plans for how they can do it. And the payments would be made upon achieving milestones. So what that does is it reduces the risk from the government to have to put money out for things that don't work. The government only pays when the milestones are checked. The second thing it does is it helps, it gets investors excited because investors say, well, I put in $100, the government's going to come in and put $100 or $100 million. And that's a huge lever on my investment. And then the other thing I want to say about the fusion program in particular, it's different than the NASA program.
01:02:05.275 - 01:02:56.541, Speaker E: The NASA program is pushing understood science. We know how to do rockets, we've done it before. Fusion is different. This is a scientific program. And so there's been a lot of encouragement and contracts happening between national laboratories and the private companies. And this is something that was really encouraged. The national laboratories are, where are the crown, the scientific crown jewels of the companies, at least one of them, in addition to the universities, of course, but the facilities that are available there, the scientific expertise, and allowing and funding the private companies to work with the national laboratories and universities to solve these really intractable scientific problems is something that was, is really also encouraged and has been funded through the milestone program.
01:02:56.541 - 01:03:09.305, Speaker E: So that's a little bit about the backstory. And the folks here talking about it have really done an amazing job in getting accepted into the program and starting to hit those initial milestones.
01:03:10.245 - 01:03:11.145, Speaker C: Fusion.
01:03:13.005 - 01:03:15.265, Speaker D: Is not rocket science. It's much harder.
01:03:17.965 - 01:03:18.865, Speaker E: Absolutely.
01:03:19.955 - 01:04:22.507, Speaker F: I'm going to take a, not a contrarian view. The milestone program is an incredible achievement. I think one of the challenges that I think we all faced putting it together is it is a cost reimbursement program. It is not a grant program. Therefore, we have to go and persuade private investors to put money in to allow us to achieve the milestones, to then get the reimbursement. With that, that comes a tension between the rights that the DOE and others would look for providing that money and the rights that a private company and a private set of investors would look for and the protections and the value that they're creating. And I think that to some degree has also influenced the collaborations of which there are many with the, with the academic institutions, because again, to the extent you're using government dollars versus private dollars, there are other restrictions that apply and there's inherent lack of flexibility in certain aspects, particularly around the intellectual property, which is obviously a key, a key part of the value proposition here.
01:04:22.507 - 01:05:15.255, Speaker F: That being said, I think the thing that's really encouraging is the fact that despite all those challenges, eight different companies that in theory could have been seen as competitors worked very collaboratively with the doe, who worked outside their comfort zone. I think, in terms of the way that the program was set up and the speed at which we were attempting to apply it. And so I think it's a huge achievement and a huge testament to the willingness of all the parties to reach a compromise. And that kind of spirit of collaboration is going to be incredibly important going forward, hopefully with more significant appropriations under the program. But it will allow us to increase the collaboration both with the DOE and with the national labs and with the academic institutions. And that is all going to be absolutely necessary to the success of not only the individual companies, but the industry as a whole.
01:05:17.675 - 01:06:17.735, Speaker G: Yeah, certainly an ambitious program and structure bringing private and public and, you know, universities together just a bit on, you know, the milestone program for us and then briefly on universities. So for us, we had a sort of technology roadmap largely based on our existing device. And our team over in the UK, about 300 people, has really strived really hard to push performance on our existing device. We work closely over the last decade with national labs like Princeton plasma physics lab, first private fusion company to achieve 100 million degrees Celsius. This also de risking the HTS technology. So our milestone program has a lot of really exciting technical points around Higher triple product in ST40, which is our spherical tokamak. We just finished commissioning our full set of poloidal and toroidal field coils.
01:06:17.735 - 01:06:56.519, Speaker G: So essentially a full set of HTS magnets in the configuration necessary and then on the university engagement. And as I mentioned, we've been working with the national labs under Infuse, which is another program, for over about a decade now. A handful of them. Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, Oak Ridge National Lab, Sandia National Lab, Idaho National Lab. There's a lot and leveraging Their expertise and working closely with our legal team around figuring out ways to ensure IP protection. I often think I should have gotten a law degree at this point. But I think the exciting thing also is universities.
01:06:56.519 - 01:07:28.595, Speaker G: So recently hired a PhD from University of Illinois and he's been fantastic. We've worked with the uiuc, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign to further our understanding and expertise in lithium, which is really a critical technology for us across everything from our diverter to blankets. And so we see lithium, liquid lithium, as well as as a differentiator. And so we worked with UIUC in the past and we look forward to working with them under the milestone program as well.
01:07:30.175 - 01:07:47.515, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. So I think we'll get to a broader question that will probably take us to the end of the panel and that's how can academia make you go faster both from the academic side and from the industrial side. We heard hints of that in the conversation so far, but now you can tackle the question directly and you get the first Krista.
01:07:49.815 - 01:08:36.755, Speaker H: So obviously the role of academia and I think you heard it here, is absolutely critical. One thing a little bit tangential, if I can, that I'll point to, I think was mentioned, is fusion is really our Sputnik opportunity. For those of you who know that reference the space race and to think about sort of the competition out there globally to really achieve commercial viable product in fusion. I also think of it as sort of the rocket race. We have a lot of engineers graduating who want to go work for SpaceX. They get really excited about that. And so really just this opportunity for fusion, as we communicate more and more of the successes you're hearing about today, right.
01:08:36.755 - 01:09:27.375, Speaker H: For fusion to inspire a generation in science and engineering is critical. And so I think academia can kind of help help with that and help the companies with that kind of get that messaging out and again to attract the best, the brightest and quite a few of them, a lot of them to help make this happen. I think academia too is recognizing, and it's been mentioned here, that this isn't just plasma physicists anymore. And I think you mentioned it, Michael, is this is about many, many complex systems that require scientists and engineers. It requires techno economic analyses around business. It requires policy. There's been some great achievements in policy happening for fusion as of late, so that's great to see.
01:09:27.375 - 01:10:09.985, Speaker H: We will have to deal with more of that, I'm sure, moving forward and then, you know, what is life going to be like when we have relatively inexpensive energy out there, globally available, changing economies, emerging economies and that's where academia can really play a role as thinking about all of those multidisciplinary aspects of what commercially viable fusion that's applied globally, that's available globally, what that's going to look like. So that's in addition to, I think, some of the sciencey sort of things that you've mentioned. And I just wanted to make sure that we're thinking about that broadly.
01:10:14.725 - 01:10:50.245, Speaker G: I really resonate with what the Dean has shared. I think for us specifically, we're excited about doing what we're calling secondments. So that's where our technical team can be embedded in a university and do information sharing. So that's something we're. We're looking to do in the next six months, essentially with uiuc, we want to do that with more universities. And it's about incubating the workforce for us. And it's not just the PhDs, it's also across the spectrum, as mentioned, around social science and policy.
01:10:50.245 - 01:11:13.575, Speaker G: This is the time really to have expertise in everything from government relations to media and communications. It is, in a sense, a time where there are so many issues before Congress that we need to keep this on people's radar. And so I do think we need to leverage expertise across the spectrum.
01:11:15.315 - 01:12:12.695, Speaker F: Yeah, I think to lean into that a little more. I think obviously the talent across the spectrum that's going to be required for all aspects of fusion to make it a reality is huge. I think another thing is, as someone pointed out to me yesterday, the best way to get the governments to act, and both from a regulatory, from a social change perspective and equally with respect to funding, is just sheer weight and momentum in public opinion. So I think the academic institutions can play a fantastic role in helping just to get the message out there. I mean, even five years ago, the running joke was always Fusion's 15 years away, 20 years away, 30 years away. It always will be. I think the educational part of just public perception and understanding, not only how close we are to fusion as a reality and as to some degree a panacea for so many things that we're currently facing challenge with on a global level will be extremely important.
01:12:18.475 - 01:13:08.241, Speaker E: I think a lot of things that make a lot of sense have been said about education. The only, only thing new thing I can think of to say is that fusion needs people that are not plasma physicists. It needs more plasma physicists. Sure. But there, there are opportunities in fusion and not just in the material science in engineering, which are needed, but I think fusion needs lawyers, lawyers that are lawyers that are experts in the atomic Energy act, in NRC regulations, in energy law. It needs people that are experts in community engagement and understanding what communities want when it comes to energy technologies. And the list goes on and on.
01:13:08.241 - 01:13:17.447, Speaker E: So I think that if there are folks in the audience that have interest in those areas, there's definitely important roles to be played in this area.
01:13:17.481 - 01:13:53.723, Speaker C: Area. Yeah, I just want to build on that point that Sam's just made. You know, I mean, you can just keep going and going. Right? It's a, we need economists, we need operators, we need cryogenic engineers. It's actually a challenge to figure out what technical and social and economic, et cetera, kind of disciplines are not involved in fusion and not impacted just because it is such a transformational opportunity. And I think what this brings us back to is that this is really a time actually for universities to step up. Right.
01:13:53.723 - 01:14:24.869, Speaker C: So fusion has traditionally been in the wheelhouse of the national labs. Big devices, decades long projects, billions of dollars, teams of hundreds. Right. So this is what the national labs were designed for. And as those types of devices transition into the private sphere, what are we actually turning to as far as partner programs? We're turning to smaller and faster programs, multidisciplinary, producing graduates. Right. Those are university programs.
01:14:24.869 - 01:14:47.247, Speaker C: And you know, I invite the audience to read the paper from September of last year written by Carlos and Dennis White on this topic where they argue for the increasing relevance of university. And so, you know, CFS is very keen to see this happen and to understand with our university partners what is an uptick in the presence of Fusion on campus look like.
01:14:47.391 - 01:14:47.695, Speaker F: Right.
01:14:47.735 - 01:15:33.475, Speaker C: It's not necessarily a requirement that we set up, you know, a new undergraduate curriculum. Right. Because many of the existing courses and disciplines are already relevant. But what we do need is we need for people to understand that Fusion is coming. Fusion is this diverse basket of challenges and you might already be able to contribute and be, you know, be a part of the conversation, be a part of the team and whether this looks like fusion centers that draw in, you know, funding from industry and fund a few mattress programs and connect across departments to minors and concentrations. You know, there's, there's really a tool set we need to build with our university partners to understand how Fusion gets into the university conversation and begins that sort of S curve ramp in universities.
01:15:35.775 - 01:16:13.601, Speaker D: This is going to be fun. Push back just a little bit. You know, you've really made it when the VCs and the lawyers and regulators and the social justice warriors are all starting to pay attention. And this is so exciting because there's A lot of momentum behind fusion at the moment. People are really paying attention. Fusion is still really hard and we have lots of things to do. And one of the things that universities do is draw in and train the talent that's going to make allow us to conquer some really important fusion plasma physics questions.
01:16:13.601 - 01:17:00.945, Speaker D: In addition to the engineer, I think we're going to get engineers from adjacent industries. You're recruiting a bunch of really talented people that just want to build stuff that's cool and, and so those people are almost exist now. We need more of them. But I think we need to pay attention to the fusion science itself also and strengthen that. Bringing in the best talent means having new small labs building up very quick and fast where you're doing something with purpose that has a long term vision of going somewhere where nobody has gone before. It isn't just mining data on an national lab tokamak that's been run for 30 years. And that's what we need in the fusion industry.
01:17:00.945 - 01:17:16.185, Speaker D: And I think academia can provide that. So I think this is complimentary, but I think we have to reinforce that need for preserving the knowledge that we've developed over 60 years. Universities can do that in a way I think that companies won't do.
01:17:17.965 - 01:17:26.763, Speaker A: Okay. So I think we can have a few people jump in before the end, but this will just be the closing thoughts part of it. And I think, Charlie, you get to.
01:17:26.859 - 01:17:30.163, Speaker F: Sorry. Just as the lawyer on the panel not wanting to.
01:17:30.259 - 01:17:31.211, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
01:17:31.403 - 01:18:08.705, Speaker F: Too much of a stereotypical. The one thing I would say, I would kind of put it back as the question you posed earlier is one thing to think about is, you know, it's okay to kind of fantasize and dream a little bit about what the world can look like if we can really achieve this. You know, we're talking about cost effective, abundant energy for all which you can have any time, anywhere, you know, and it's carbon free, it's not going to damage the planet. It's actually going to give us so much opportunity. And I think from an academic standpoint, starting to think about the world of possibilities and what we can do with that kind of future is going to be really important.
01:18:10.045 - 01:18:10.533, Speaker C: Okay.
01:18:10.589 - 01:18:38.641, Speaker A: So I think that might be the closing word. But if anyone wants to jump in with the last thought now as your. I think that's, that's the one. Let me thank all of you very much. You can stay in your chair for a minute longer. I'm just going to flash the, the next steps for today. So we are going to have the tour of the plasma physics lab, which is next door for the next hour or so.
01:18:38.641 - 01:19:09.285, Speaker A: We're not quite sure how long it's going to take to get everybody through, so it might be a little bit of a roll transition between the tour and the reception. So the reception, like I mentioned, is next door on this level, and then the lab itself is a few floors down, and I'm not quite sure where the staging area is going to be. I guess it'll probably be in front of the of the reception room. That makes sense to I don't know if Alexis is here to save us for a third time on that question. By the way, hand it to Alexis for saving us multiple times through various technical.
