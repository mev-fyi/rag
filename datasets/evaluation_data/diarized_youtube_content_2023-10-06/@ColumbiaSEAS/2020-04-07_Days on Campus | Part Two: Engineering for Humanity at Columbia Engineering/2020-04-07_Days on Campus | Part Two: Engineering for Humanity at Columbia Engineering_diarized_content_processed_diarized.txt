00:00:14.170 - 00:00:24.750, Speaker B: Columbia engineering is very different. I mean, we talk about engineering for humanity, right? I think it's a new way of thinking now. Consequences are everything. Where are the societal challenges?
00:00:34.410 - 00:01:30.230, Speaker A: We are taking care of the entire world in this sense, right? There is nothing that is off limits to us. The purpose of senior design project is basically our students entire undergraduate life. They've been studying engineering and now they have the opportunity to form a team and come up with an idea of their own. And then they have to build it, of course, and test it and then present it at the expo.
00:01:30.970 - 00:01:39.830, Speaker B: The point that's particularly important to me is when the teams become really autonomous. That's when we go from being students to being young engineers.
00:01:40.210 - 00:01:48.860, Speaker C: I think the most engaging part of the process for me would definitely be the solution design and the autonomy that comes with it. I think that was for me in the moment when I realized, you know, I'm an engineer, I can do this.
