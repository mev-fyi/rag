00:00:00.690 - 00:00:34.990, Speaker A: You. Wireless technology is evolving at a remarkable rate, with bitrates increasing by four orders of magnitude over 20 years, a higher growth rate than even Moore's law for computing. The Cosmos team believes that the power advanced wireless test bed should enable researchers to explore the technology sweet spot of ultra high bandwidth and low latency, a capability that will enable a broad new class of real time applications such as augmented reality navigation, smart city control, and cloud based vehicles.
00:00:35.810 - 00:00:46.260, Speaker B: The community in New York is extremely interested in how technology can be brought to bear to improve the community, to make people's lives measurably better.
00:00:46.870 - 00:01:00.390, Speaker C: The mission is to transform Harlem into a tech and innovation hub, and what that means is creating opportunities for young people, in fact, creating opportunities intergenerationally for people to participate in the digital economy.
00:01:01.210 - 00:02:10.890, Speaker A: The cosmos testbed has been designed as a multilayered, software defined system, which offers maximum flexibility for experimentation. The design goals are realized by using advanced software defined radios, software defined networks, optical networking, and edge computing technologies, achieving wideband and gigabit per second performance. Our design uses the latest software controlled white box, optical, WDM, and radio overfiber technologies to create experimental, user customizable, high speed front, hall, and backhaul networks that provide a fast interconnect between radio nodes and edge computing clusters. The architecture introduces a high performance cloud as an integral part of the access network. The compute cluster integrates graphical processing units and hardware accelerators for fast signal processing. Our testbed control and management software leverages proven open source software, which has been successfully used for orbit and other test beds worldwide. Rapid urbanization is shaping the world's economies and defining the major technological challenges of the 21st century.
00:02:10.890 - 00:02:23.438, Speaker A: Deployed on the streets of new York, Cosmos will provide a dense urban environment that has a range of radio propagation characteristics, vehicular and pedestrian scenarios, and end user demographics.
00:02:23.614 - 00:02:26.274, Speaker D: Columbia University is actually perfect for this.
00:02:26.312 - 00:02:28.722, Speaker E: Test bed because we spread out over.
00:02:28.776 - 00:02:47.846, Speaker D: So much of New York. We have hundreds of residential buildings, academic buildings, all where we can deploy various Cosmos nodes. Our building infrastructure is connected by the Columbia dark fiber, which will be provided to the cosmos test bed. We also have an infrastructure that is mobile.
00:02:47.958 - 00:02:54.938, Speaker E: We have public safety vehicles, trucks, shuttles. All of this will be brought to the table for this test bed.
00:02:55.024 - 00:03:27.960, Speaker B: The infrastructure assets that New York has domain over is really important to this equation. Also, I think some of those assets that will be valuable are streetlight poles, buildings, other pieces of street furniture. Potentially. The value of this is to understand better how we can use this technology, not just to connect people to the Internet, or to connect people to each other, but also for us to think about how we can use a connected environment to do our jobs better because we have that ability to generate data and to interconnect things.
00:03:28.410 - 00:04:03.010, Speaker A: Wireless experiments not currently supported by test beds are made available to the research community by Cosmos core technology. Research problems include advanced radio techniques such as massive MIMO and adaptive beam forming, millimeter wave heterogeneous networks, dynamic spectrum sharing, integration and convergence of optical and wireless technologies, and edge and radio cloud computing. These core advancements enable applications research such as telemedicine, automotive, advanced IoT for smart cities, and control of emergency and safety devices.
00:04:03.430 - 00:04:26.378, Speaker B: And taking it out of the laboratory and into the real urban setting in a way that arguably only New York could provide, I think is critical not just to the way we understand that technology in New York and how we will use it to forward our endeavors and our goals, but truthfully, I think it will lend a lot of information and insight for cities across the country and, frankly, around the world.
00:04:26.544 - 00:04:59.120, Speaker C: And we at Silicon Harlem, working with the variety of teams, specifically with Columbia University, NYU, and Rutgers and others, has allowed us to attract these projects into Harlem, utilizing dark fiber inside of our city as a ring so that we can do real specific research, both hardware and software. These are the things we've dreamed of. So we believe it sets the model for the entire city and hopefully becomes a real model for the entire country and perhaps even the world.
00:04:59.490 - 00:05:03.570, Speaker D: As we like to say in New York, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.
