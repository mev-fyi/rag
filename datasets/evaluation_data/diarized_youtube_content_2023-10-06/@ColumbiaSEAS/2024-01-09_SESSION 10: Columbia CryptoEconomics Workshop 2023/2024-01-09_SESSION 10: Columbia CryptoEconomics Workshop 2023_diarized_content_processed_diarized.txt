00:00:13.800 - 00:00:14.350, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:17.520 - 00:00:51.040, Speaker B: We're going to get started. So this is the last session. There's going to be two presentations. I'm actually the first speaker. Yeah, my slides are not coming up. The slides are not coming up. So I'm David, I'm a researcher at Robust Incentives group at Ethereum foundation.
00:00:51.040 - 00:01:57.640, Speaker B: I'm going to be talking about Ethereum staking, a state of the union. So essentially the talk is going to be divided in three parts. First I'm going to talk about the state of affairs and this is going to be a view on the current metrics around Ethereum staking and the current monetary policy for ETH. Then I'm going to talk about the ideal state where we would like to be, and this is going to involve some security in ocean and then resilience and balance. And then finally I'll talk about future directions and both in terms of monetary policy upgrade that we can do to the protocol and then more around the research roadmap that we are thinking about. So first, what is the current state of supply? So today the supply stock is there is around 120,000,000 of ETH in circulation, of which around 28 million are staked, which is about 23.5% of supply is staked.
00:01:57.640 - 00:02:32.070, Speaker B: And then the yearly flow, the net issuance. Every year we have an issuance rate from in protocol rewards of zero point 86 million per year. We burn 1.52 million eth per year. So the supply growth is actually negative. So every year we are decreasing supply by about 660,000 ETH, which is about 0.5% decrease currently.
00:02:32.070 - 00:03:21.698, Speaker B: So the chart on top is basically the road we took to this 28 million ETH stake. It starts in November 2020 when the beacon chain was turned on. And essentially deposits have been increasing at a rate of around 20,000 ETH per day. And then there is below you have the average daily deposit and there is a visible spike around the time that withdrawals were enabled. So people, it was less risky to stake. So deposits spiked to more than 100,000 per day on average. But now we are back staked.
00:03:21.698 - 00:04:28.450, Speaker B: Supply is still growing, but it's growing at a much smaller rate. We are even below the long run average. Yeah. One other important notion is that due to the emergence of the staking pools and liquid staking, essentially now we have different classes of stakers. So on the left we have solo stakers. So here eth holder just directly spins up a validator and stakes their ETH on ethereum. On the other extreme there is decentralized staking service provider so here the staker delegates their ETH to a service provider, and then the service provider in the decentralized case allocates the EtH to node operators, which essentially operate validators on the staker behalf, and then redistribute fees.
00:04:28.450 - 00:05:26.522, Speaker B: So then the node operator takes part of the fee, the provider takes part of the fee, and then the staker gets his discounted reward. And then in the middle there is a centralized staking service provider. So here there is a centralized entity that staker delegates their ETH to, and then they also operate nodes. Sometimes node services can be outsourced, but this is a logical entity. For example, you can think about Coinbase. So the market structure is as follows, like it's divided between all these providers. Lido, which is a decentralized staking service provider, has around 32 33% of the market share.
00:05:26.522 - 00:06:38.980, Speaker B: Then there is Coinbase, 14%, then figment, binance and others. And then I'm also showing this group, which is non categorized entities and solo stakers, of which the solo stakers are a minority, actually. So next I'll discuss the current policy that is live on the Ethereum protocol. So the Ethereum protocol sets essentially a demand function for deposits, essentially rewards y. Here is the APY and is this function of the total deposit where there is essentially two parameters that are some constants set in the Ethereum protocol. This number 64 is a reward factor that scales the deposit. And then there is the exponent minus one half, which essentially determines this downward sloping inverse square root function that you see.
00:06:38.980 - 00:07:07.330, Speaker B: And in the chart I'm also showing the point where we are today. So we are at 28.22 million e deposit and the APR is around 3.1%. So one thing to note is that this APR is actually the APR purely from in protocol rewards. There is no mev. And I'll keep it simple for most of the talk. I'll talk about mev in the end.
00:07:07.330 - 00:07:52.670, Speaker B: So we've seen that supply has been increasing, deposits have been growing. So one question to ask is, when will this stop? So the answer is that we actually don't know. So here in this chart, I'm drawing a hypothetical supply schedule for deposits. But the protocol doesn't know anything about this. So the equilibrium could be closed, could be around 33 million, as I draw in this picture. But it could be also far. So we simply don't know today.
00:07:52.670 - 00:09:04.420, Speaker B: And the reality is that this supply schedule is like hypothetical, but is also quite simplified because this may change over time for different reasons. Innovation, growth, internal external factors, including possibility of getting rewards out of protocol. And, yeah, so we are actually looking into these things. I talk more about it, but the main question is, what should we do? Should we just leave things as is and let the equilibrium play out with this demand function that was set up more than three years ago, or should we do something about it? So, before answering that question, I'll talk about what's the ideal state that we would like to see? So I'll start from algorithmic security. So, essentially, this is one of the main properties that we want to maintain. So the Ethereum consensus protocol is safe and live up to one third byzantine nodes. But if there is an attacker that controls more than a critical threshold, they can cause damage to the protocol.
00:09:04.420 - 00:09:44.400, Speaker B: And I'm going to give some example. The damage is actually increasing in the threshold that you control. So if you control more than one third, you can delay finality. You can do temporary censorship, which at one third becomes meaningful. If you control more than one alpha, you can reorg the available chain, you can censor, even though you cannot finalize. If you control more than two thirds, you can do pretty much everything you want. You can finalize the chain, you can do all of the above, and you can do it with impunity, because you cannot be slashed.
00:09:44.400 - 00:10:48.820, Speaker B: So, talking about the ideal state then, is like, basically we would like two things. One is like, the staked capital should be distributed uniformly between, hopefully, a large amount of entities, including solo stakers. So it's what I call balance. And then there is this other notion, which I call Social Security. So essentially, if we are in a situation where the stake capital is far from the entire supply is a smaller fraction, much less than 100%, then essentially we have some good properties that even if something fails here and there is one entity that gets more than a critical threshold, then the community can respond by socially forking. Governance is not entangled. So there is more agency.
00:10:48.820 - 00:11:57.816, Speaker B: So this is the state where we would like to be in. I actually borrowed this from Danny Ryan that has been talking about this property for a long time. And actually, both Danny and Mike have some posts, presentations on all the possible cases that when you deviate from this state, how things can go wrong in those cases, but then how do we translate this into our deposit demand and more of the monetary policy potential upgrades? So here I'm showing the same chart as before. Like on the x axis, we have total deposits in million etH. And essentially, the argument here is that we would really like to be somewhere in this, let's call it safe range, right. So if too little eth is deposited, essentially it's too cheap to attack the chain. The chain is not secure.
00:11:57.816 - 00:12:52.640, Speaker B: It's too easy to go above the critical threshold. If too much is deposited, we have different problems. So over issuance eTH is in liquid, so there is not too much economic bandwidth for things like decentralized stable coins backed by ETH. And then, as I was saying before, there is not enough buffer in case something goes wrong. So now we can talk about what can we do? Future direction. So here I want to give a shout out to Anders Ellison, who's a research scientist in our team that has been doing work on a few of the upgrades that I will mention and on many of the research topics that I will mention. But of course we would like to collaborate with anyone else that is interested.
00:12:52.640 - 00:13:56.738, Speaker B: Okay, so essentially I'm going to present two ideas. So the first one is like an adaptive policy. So here essentially I'm drawing the same demand function, but now I'm leaving f as something that can potentially be changed. Right? So how would this adaptive policy work? Essentially, suppose that we set a target for deposit, that is, let's say, call it 25 million eth. So the midpoint of the range that I was showing before then essentially you can have an adaptive policy in the same style of 1559, for example, where you can algorithmically adjust the reward factor. So if you observe deposit above target, you decrease the APY, effectively. And if deposits are above target, you increase it.
00:13:56.738 - 00:14:36.990, Speaker B: So there is actually no need of other information, no need to know supply. It's just adaptive getting this deposit information. And so the pros of this is that the adjustments are automated. So in the long run we want something where we don't need to go and change the monetary policy manually at every art fork. Also, because the time when the art fork land is also hard to predict. And then the con is that it's a bit more complex than the current one. So we probably need to do a little bit more research.
00:14:36.990 - 00:15:15.740, Speaker B: It needs to be discussed. So the other idea is to have fixed policy like similar to today, but change the demand function. So in this case we change the functional form. And this is an example, this is a variant of something that also Vitalik talked about. So here, essentially we are setting an interval, a range that we would like for deposit. We are setting a lower bound and an upper bound. So the lower bound is ten and the upper bound is 40 in this example.
00:15:15.740 - 00:16:23.060, Speaker B: And essentially here there is no updates needed. So we are just specifying a demand function that makes sure that when the deposits go close to the lower bound, then the apy grows, and when it goes close to the upper bound, then the Apy decreases a lot. So discouraging more deposits and keeping the desired amount. So the pros is that it's a simple fixed policy. The con is that potentially we need to do more tuning, since we set this once, and then we ideally don't touch it anymore. And then there is also the problem of discouragement attacks, especially in some particular range. Okay, so in my last two slides, I'll discuss some topics that we are actively doing research in.
00:16:23.060 - 00:17:07.562, Speaker B: So the first one is around understanding what the supply function look like. And this could help inform both the tuning and then some optimal policies. So here I'm drawing essentially the inverse supply function. This is also hypothetical. The important thing to note here is that there is this thick red curve, which is the aggregate supply across all the potential staker. But then I'm also drawing the supply curve for all the three classes of staker that I was mentioning before. So, solo stakers, decentralized pool and centralized pool.
00:17:07.562 - 00:18:14.002, Speaker B: So the red line is the horizontal sum of the other three. So for example, you can think that at 2% APY, we have around 55 million deposit, of which 32 are coming from centralized exchanges, 18 from decentralized exchanges, and 5 million from solo stakers. So we would really understand how this looks like. Why is this important? Because there is an hypothesis that solo staker have reservation yield, which is much higher than the others, for obvious reasons, that they are not as efficient at capturing exogenous yield. Exogenous including mev, exogenous to the consensus layer. And there is also many other factors of supply that we need to study more to actually inform our policy. To conclude, I'll give a summary of the areas we are looking into.
00:18:14.002 - 00:19:01.822, Speaker B: So one, on the demand side, we are looking into what is the effect of negative yield in some range for some classes of stakers, importantly solo stakers. Then what are the effects on mev, on the effective yield that stakers get? So today it's not 3.1%, it's more around like 3.94%. Because if you account for mev, but this is very volatile, then as I mentioned, supply. There is not just the different classes I mentioned, but there is also different factors that affect the individual decision to stake, like costs, risks, and also exogenous yield. So Kaido was talking about egg and layer and risk taking. So this is actually an important consideration.
00:19:01.822 - 00:19:39.840, Speaker B: And Anders started doing some research on this specifically as well. And then on the modeling side, this is maybe less operational, but it would be good to have more models similar to what urban presented yesterday, where you study these more aggregate macro level properties from an economics perspective. And we're also doing some research on new type of attacks in case we do update the policies. And this is the state of the union. Thanks.
00:19:50.480 - 00:20:11.460, Speaker C: All of this is ETH denominated for obvious reasons. But more and more of the assets that live on chain are dollar denominated, whether they're stable coins or we're seeing the tokenization of treasuries and other real world assets. So I'm curious whether you think about that, if we should think about it, because then it makes the actual price of ethan dollars relevant.
00:20:12.440 - 00:20:40.670, Speaker B: Interesting. Stable coins, maybe. Those are usually, I think about the ethnominated assets like nfts as well. Stablecoins. I'm not sure if it matters, but for example. Yeah, tokenized real world assets, it does matter. I'm not sure what would change in terms of.
00:20:45.480 - 00:21:03.756, Speaker C: From the property of. We want to make sure that the chain, the crypto economic security of the chain is always higher than the assets riding on top of it. Now, obviously with things like stable coins, it's not as big of a concern because the issuer could do things if something bad happens.
00:21:03.858 - 00:21:04.510, Speaker A: But.
00:21:06.320 - 00:21:10.670, Speaker C: I'm just curious if this enters the analysis at all.
00:21:11.280 - 00:21:40.890, Speaker B: Yeah. So let's say that part of the assets are like denominated in USD. Yeah. I'm not sure from an operational perspective we are not thinking about this, but maybe from a macro perspective this becomes important. Yeah.
00:21:41.420 - 00:21:42.170, Speaker A: Okay.
00:21:43.020 - 00:21:49.884, Speaker B: So maybe the next talk could help give an answer. I don't have too many comments on this.
00:21:49.922 - 00:21:50.510, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:58.830 - 00:22:12.800, Speaker D: Hi, thank you for the talk. Can you go to the. There's one of the graph that shows CSSP desp and then there's an aggregated one. Yeah, I think you just went past it.
00:22:13.330 - 00:22:14.810, Speaker B: Oh, the supply.
00:22:14.970 - 00:22:32.364, Speaker D: Yeah. For this one, I think it's a really cool idea. But how do you differentiate them, when you think about separating them, these different components out?
00:22:32.402 - 00:22:35.170, Speaker B: You mean if you want to do an empirical study, for example.
00:22:35.700 - 00:22:36.544, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:36.742 - 00:23:33.250, Speaker B: So here the idea is that some of these are already tagged. Like there is way of tagging them. So in that sense we can get some data on some providers pretty accurate, on some a little bit less accurate. But the goal here is provided that we can get that data to actually try to get some idea of. Okay, what does the reservation yield look like from centralized versus decentralized exchanges? So if your question is purely on the data side, I'm not the expert, but there is other people that are looking into this data, and we have this data that you can use to tag validators. Some of them are public.
00:23:33.700 - 00:23:38.950, Speaker D: I think my question is more on the side of, once you have these data, how do you draw the line out?
00:23:42.520 - 00:24:24.316, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, that's a very good point. So here, essentially, you need to observe the state of the market at different deposit sites in order to be able to estimate these curves. Okay. I believe that right now we have more than one year of data, so it could be possible to get some initial estimates. But of course, there is different methods. So, for example, when there is a market change, maybe you want to use that discontinuity to identify some supply sensitivity. For example, we could look at what happened when the withdrawals were enabled.
00:24:24.316 - 00:24:46.776, Speaker B: But, yeah, so this is all, like empirical study, like econometrics type technique that we can use. We have some ideas, but we haven't gone too deep down this road, because before there was not too much data. So, yeah, it's an interesting avenue for future research on this.
00:24:46.958 - 00:24:48.170, Speaker D: Yeah. Thank you.
00:24:54.080 - 00:25:51.390, Speaker E: In this deflationary phase, there is also the part that it contributes to the inequality in the validator side, because I think with less overall, with a lower overall supply, they have a larger share. And also, I wasn't here in the morning, so I didn't know whether the answer was mev will go to zero or not, but that contributes to. So I wonder if you thought of the burn as well as something to at least as a tool to, let's say, minimize deflation in a sense that it doesn't allow over issuance, but throwing it all to zero, like burning it all. But in theory. In principle, there is nothing against putting it in a bank that the monetary authority could use at some point.
00:25:53.680 - 00:25:57.632, Speaker B: Like putting the extra eth in a bank instead of burning it.
00:25:57.766 - 00:26:14.328, Speaker E: Yeah, instead of burning it, or keeping some to fund development or things like that, or even to use as a monetary policy tool. So is that out of the picture? Because there is nothing in principle, that requires.
00:26:14.444 - 00:26:44.860, Speaker B: Let me make sure I understand the question. So, most of the analysis here was essentially looking at the staked eth equilibrium, not at the full monetary equilibrium, which is what Brett is going to discuss. So maybe this was also related to the previous question. Are you asking about what is the effect of the circulating supply equilibrium on?
00:26:44.930 - 00:26:51.068, Speaker E: So maybe we'll get to it. When you talk about this full supply, it is just that, about what is burned.
00:26:51.164 - 00:27:18.552, Speaker B: I have a small answer, which is like, there is also one way of targeting a range of deposits, which is not in absolute term, but it's in relative term, relative to the total supply. So instead of targeting between 10 million and 40 million, you target between 15% and 50%. That seems to go in that direction. But, yeah, I think that's my answer.
00:27:18.606 - 00:27:19.210, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:20.380 - 00:27:26.460, Speaker B: Cool. So I think next we have Bret.
00:27:42.660 - 00:28:14.488, Speaker A: All right, it works. Okay, can everybody hear me? Okay, so there's a lot of alpha in here. I know it's the last talk of the day, but I hope you pay attention to this. So just real quick, former partner PM, a couple of systematic trading firms ran early stage crypto venture at another venture capital firm. And now I'm currently doing a grant with the EF working on what I'm about to discuss today. Just a quick disclosure. There's a little bit of math in there.
00:28:14.488 - 00:29:12.300, Speaker A: If you're not a math person, completely ignore it. I hope that the context, and also what I'm saying is going to clarify that for you. So don't waste your time if that's not your thing. Okay, so let's take a step back. What is the economics of Ethereum? And specifically, I'm going to be talking about the economic security of Ethereum. How do we define that? What is the objective of Ethereum's economic security? Then I'm going to talk about the valuation of EtH, who holds it, how do they behave? From there you can identify the stakers, again, how do they behave, and then how do they interact with Ethereum as it exists today? Then you can identify who actually runs the nodes and similarly go through that exercise. And then finally I'll talk about how we should move forward and what things we need to study to understand the risk that I'm going to mention in the next slide.
00:29:12.300 - 00:29:39.204, Speaker A: So the growth in derivatives is concerning. I think some people more or less are concerned about Lido. Being as large as it is raises credible neutrality, security and economic issues. That's fine. I was wrong in my prediction years ago that it would be Blackrock. So I think it's a blessing that it is, in fact, Lido that has taken the torch here on this. So there is positives to it.
00:29:39.204 - 00:30:57.240, Speaker A: And I also believe that it is futile, given the economics of the protocol, to social pressure, to self limit. So that being the case, there's other things we've heard a ton about restaking, and then there's also block space derivatives. How do all of these things tie into the base economics or economic security of Ethereum? So a very basic question, what is the objective of ether, or more specifically, what is the crypto economic or the economic security objective of Ethereum. And it's basically around the principle that you need to know your objective in order to manage the risk of it, right? So very simplistically and ignoring the profit to attack, we want to maximize some function of the market cap, the staking ratio and the distribution of the token, right? So related to Sriram's talk yesterday, if you multiply the market cap and the staking ratio divided by three, you get his cost to attack. But also importantly is the distribution of the token, right? There's search costs involved in trying to collude with others. If there's a very large contingent of people holding staked ether, then it's very difficult to get enough stake to do something bad. Okay, so this is very broad, very basic.
00:30:57.240 - 00:31:28.644, Speaker A: It's a very complicated question. And now there's some issues, right? There's these three variables. There's trade offs in optimizing or maximizing these three variables. They can conflict with each other. And then also, more importantly, is which things are inside and outside the control of the protocol. What levers can we pull to maximize this function to whatever objective we want it to? So let's start with the first one, market cap. So ETH is valuable for two reasons, revenues and convenience.
00:31:28.644 - 00:32:00.480, Speaker A: Okay? So people use it to pay for fees and that value accrues to the token. Right? So the first term here is fees and mev. So you can think of that just generally as fees as gas. There's seniorage, right? There's new issuance of tokens. Generally we've had a deflationary type environment, but there is new issuance at times. And the market needs to want to hold that additional ether. And if they do, then that value accrues to the value of eTh.
00:32:00.480 - 00:32:47.804, Speaker A: And then the rightmost term is convenience. So there's the theta term on the left, and there's the a term on the right. And the a term on the right you can think of as the expected amount of eth denominated consumption over some period of time, right? So if I expect to buy groceries, a certain amount of groceries over the next two weeks, I don't know when I'm going to do it. So I'm going to hold some dollars on hand in order to have the convenience of buying groceries as I need them. So think of that generally. You can also think of theta term on the left as the percentage of the amount I expect to pay over a certain period of time. So if I expect to do a lot of activity on Ethereum that requires a lot of gas.
00:32:47.804 - 00:33:33.612, Speaker A: I'm going to hold it at any point in time quite a bit. So you can also, if you're familiar with the equation of exchange, you can think of the inverse of theta as velocity for people that are more familiar with that type of model. And then you have RD, which is your traditional discount rate. And then ga is the growth in a, which is again, eats value as, let's just say a numerair for certain goods, that being gas. And then you can think of nfts, right? People buy nfts with ether, so that also increases the value of the market cap. Now, there's an important assumption here. I'm assuming there's no reflexivity between the amount people want to pay in dollars for gas and the market cap or price of ether.
00:33:33.612 - 00:33:53.590, Speaker A: And that's important to circumvent the circularity between the price, because if everybody bids one ETH all of the time, and I'm trying to get a dollar value market cap here, then you can see how the price feeds back into the revenues of the protocol. And this sort of breaks down and you have to add additional terms.
00:33:54.040 - 00:33:54.404, Speaker B: Okay?
00:33:54.442 - 00:34:21.200, Speaker A: So that's the value of ETH and why it's valuable. Who holds it. So we can say there's two types of people that hold it. There's investors who are interested in earning the fees that accrue to the token that are interested in earning the seniorage. And then there's users that hold ETH for convenience at any point in time. Right? There are dgens that like to buy nfts in bull markets. They like to use gas if they are trying to make transfers.
00:34:21.200 - 00:35:16.416, Speaker A: So these are the two groups that I've consolidated here. It gets a little more complicated, but those are the two groups I want you to focus on. So how do these two groups behave? So for users, you can say convenience is a function of the inflation dynamics of the token, okay? So users will demand less ETH if inflation is high and unpredictable. And it's similar to what you see in traditional economies, right? Where if inflation is high, you'll see velocity go up, people are less willing to hold it, they turn it over very quickly. So at any point in time, nobody's willing to hold any excess eth, right? So this is a very simplistic money demand equation. And urban's equation yesterday embedded this in a money and utility equation. But this spells it out, breaks it out.
00:35:16.416 - 00:36:20.260, Speaker A: It's similar in spirit, but it actually points out what is driving the demand for money, as opposed to just some coefficient that represents utility for having ETH. One of the trade offs that you'll see is that there's a trade off between the amount of inflation you can have and the amount people are going to be willing to hold ether at any point in time. So if inflation is high, you can get more seniorage and potentially more people staking, but at the same time, people are going to be less willing to have any ETH unstaked ETH on hand in order to purchase gas or nfts. They're going to hold on to dollars, and at the last second they're going to buy ETH, and then they're going to use gas or whatever. Okay, so that's how users behave generally. Now, users don't stake, investors do. So how do they behave? So, investors, for people familiar with mean variance optimization, it's one of the more simple finance 101 type optimizations.
00:36:20.260 - 00:36:33.220, Speaker A: Investors maximize the return or the amount of ETH that you can accumulate in excess of the variance of those same returns, subject to some altruistic constraint.
00:36:33.380 - 00:36:33.992, Speaker B: Okay?
00:36:34.126 - 00:37:47.772, Speaker A: So the first portion is very simple. We want more returns for a certain amount of risk, or we want less risk, vice versa. Okay, but the last constraint here is one of the more abstract notions in all of this, which is that people, there are people out there who do value some degree of, let's call it decentralization, right? So it's similar to how people form ESG portfolios, okay, so you want to maximize the return subject to some risk, but you can't hold a portfolio whose weighted average ESG score is above or below x, right? So you don't want to hold too many oil companies or such. And such. That's the constraint some people put on themselves. Now, there's other people like myself, who don't care about this and are just trying to maximize the amount of ETh that I want, right? So for me, my target would be one, right? It just wouldn't matter. So again, very simple mean variance optimization, but with the constraint that some people actually do care about things that are detrimental to the economics of their stake.
00:37:47.772 - 00:38:29.868, Speaker A: Okay? And it's also important to point out that the investable set here is you can either solo stake, you can delegate your stake to a pool, or you can lend your eth. These are the broad opportunities you can say, provide liquidity and things like that, but you want to incorporate this external source of yield to, then you can easily incorporate other types of interesting things as well. So, given that it implies the staking ratio is. So we have to take the percentage of ETH held for convenience, and therefore the staking ratio is one minus the percentage held for convenience times one minus the percentage held in a lending protocol.
00:38:30.044 - 00:38:30.576, Speaker B: Okay?
00:38:30.678 - 00:39:17.088, Speaker A: So you can say that the staking ratio is a function of how convenient or how good ETH is as a numerair, and how competitive it is with other sources of yield that aren't related to staking. Okay, so given the design of Ethereum, so we've covered the market cap, we've covered the staking ratio. Now let's talk a little bit about the distribution. And given the design of Ethereum, what should we expect the distribution of staked ether to look like? So here's anecdotes. Right? So ethereum inadvertently results in state concentration. So there's a lack of desirability to run nodes. I don't know how many of you do.
00:39:17.088 - 00:40:04.750, Speaker A: I don't, I can, I don't, many people probably can't do either. There's a 32 eth minimum, so that naturally pushes people to pools anyways. And also it's illiquid. Okay, so once you get beyond that, you're like, okay, well, I'm going to pool my capital. So if I pool my capital, the larger the pool, or if I'm a solo staker, let's say the more I have staked, the higher my reinvestment rate, the higher my compound rate of return, the greater my sophistication probably is. If I'm a pool, Lido can probably extract a lot more mev than I personally can lower yield variance, which we'll see how we calculate that later. So you have a lower risk relative to the same return.
00:40:04.750 - 00:40:47.210, Speaker A: You have greater node diversification, which is also a source of variance. Right. Because how your nodes or your validators perform affects whether you're slashing or how much you earn on average. And then if you go into pooled liquid staking, the liquidity for the underlying eth within the protocol. So my ability to go from staked eth, let's say, to eth is much more advantageous and there's much more liquidity for the liquid staking token itself. Okay, so most eth, you can say, will be staked in larger liquid staking pools. That's a generalization that you can be pretty confident at this point in time.
00:40:47.210 - 00:41:27.530, Speaker A: So I'm not going to get too much into this, you've seen this a couple of times already, but this is how the reward yield is determined on Ethereum and what the total max eth issuance is, it's a function of two terms, k, which is the base reward factor, and x, which is the sensitivity to the amount staked in the protocol. This can be anything you want it to be. Davide alluded to potentially some other reward curves. This can be modulated and be completely different. Okay, but that's exactly what it is now. So the terms, the x is right now 0.5 and annualized, the base reward factor is about 166.
00:41:27.530 - 00:42:26.344, Speaker A: So this is an expectation for the amount of eth I hold today. Okay, I can expect to make rt reward on the amount I have today, not the amount I have tomorrow, and so on and so forth. So what is the compound rate of return? Or what's the rate at which I accumulate more eth, and what's the variance of those returns? So here you'll see capital r is the compound rate of return. So the main term we're concerned with here is rho, or the p term there. And you'll see on the right how you calculate that term, which is sy, which is the amount staked by some person, y times the reward rate divided by fee, which is the minimum amount you need to create a new validator. So the minimum amount you need to reinvest into a new validator and start earning more rewards on top of those rewards. So a simple example here you have a solo staker with 32 eth, and then you have, let's say a pool with 10,000 eth.
00:42:26.344 - 00:42:59.668, Speaker A: They both have the same r, but the row, the reinvestment rate for the solo staker is zero, four. So they can reinvest once every 25 years. Pretty much. But the person with 10,000 eth is able to do so about once a month. Okay, so between rebalancings, the person with 32 eth earns eth at a rate of 2.8%, while the same 10,000 eth staker earns 4.1%, which is relatively close to the continuously compounded rate of return.
00:42:59.668 - 00:43:44.000, Speaker A: And now, just to give you sort of a sneak preview, one way to get around this is to change the maximum effective balance, right? If you multiply it by two, and I'm a 32 e staker, I can just continuously reinvest my earnings. Everybody earns the continuously compounded rate of return. So that's just one sort of sneak preview into how we solve this problem. Okay, so higher returns, what about the variance of the returns? So this is how you calculate the variance of rewards. And for those of you familiar with bitcoin returns, are lumpy, right? Every once in a while you get a payment. Most of the times you don't. That's not welfare enhancing.
00:43:44.000 - 00:44:28.508, Speaker A: So what people want is they want smoother yields. And this is a function of three things here. The yield for proposing and attesting. Usually it should be the proposal yield is higher than the attestor yield, and then you have the proportion of staked eth held by some person. But the main derivation from all of this is that the variance of somebody's yield relative to a solo staker is inversely related to the squared amount staked that a person has. So a pool with 10,000 eth has a fraction of the volatility or the variance of a solo stake. Okay, so quick recap.
00:44:28.508 - 00:45:05.992, Speaker A: Accumulate eth at much higher rate. The more eth there is, or the bigger the pool you're in and the much lower the variance that you have. So that's one source of variance. How do we account for node diversification? So the performance of my node slashing and things like that. Okay, so node operators, what they want to do is they want to maximize the number of independent validators. So if we're assuming for right now that all different node types, which includes clients and cloud providers and things like that, are equally as reliable and easy to run, it's optimal to build a maximum. It's called decoration.
00:45:05.992 - 00:45:57.408, Speaker A: Portfolio of nodes. Okay, so I'm going to make a quick distinction between there's nodes and then validators which run within nodes. So this essentially says we want to allocate to the nodes that are most different from all the other nodes on average, right? Because if I run geth on aws in Virginia versus something else running in be, they're imperfectly correlated with each other. So I want to allocate to the ones that are most uncorrelated with all of the other nodes that I run. So once you have that, then you want to maximize the number of validators within each node. And why do you want to do that? Well, creating a new validator is virtually costless, but they are imperfectly correlated with each other. So let me give you an example.
00:45:57.408 - 00:46:38.460, Speaker A: I'm running one node, and I have ten validators running on that node. One of the validators does something wrong, gets slashed, gets kicked out of the set. Well, my other nine nodes, I can shut them down and fix them really quick or do whatever, right? I still have much more than if I just had them all in one validator, that entire stake would have been slashed and kicked out of the set. Okay, so you want to maximize the number of independent validators that you have. I could talk generally about this, but I'm going to skip it for now. So really quick. ETH is value because of revenue and convenience.
00:46:38.460 - 00:47:20.840, Speaker A: Staking depends on the reward yield, lending yields, and the convenience of holding ETH as a numerair. It's much easier and more economical to stake in a liquid staking protocol. The bigger the better. You get much higher compound rate of return with a much lower variance. Okay, and then one of the issues that was mentioned was that one of the issues is network congestion. Unless something changes, even if we maximize the effective balance, validators will still create, node operators will still create a ton of validators. Okay, so anyway, so some interesting questions.
00:47:20.840 - 00:47:42.290, Speaker A: What's the distribution of pools in equilibrium? What happens if staked ETH becomes a numerator instead of ETH? How can we make solo validators, first class citizens relative to pools, so on and so forth. Do this stuff less ultrasound money wherever Justin is, and that's it.
00:47:48.120 - 00:47:51.350, Speaker B: Thanks, Bret. Any questions?
00:47:58.760 - 00:48:40.568, Speaker F: Hi, thank you for the presentation. Just one observation. It seems to me that choosing objectives is subjective and open to questions. So, for example, the objective of valuing, of maximizing the value of eth, is, as I think, very different from an objective of maximizing the value of the use of eth. It would be something like looking at the value of the assets of the US Federal Reserve against the capitalized value of. So I don't know what the objection. And the same thing with stake.
00:48:40.568 - 00:48:58.760, Speaker F: If you have more stake, there might be an argument that there's more security over some range. On the other hand, it can also reduce the value of the ecosystem because you have less currency in circulation. So anyway, just, it's probably the hardest.
00:48:59.100 - 00:50:00.540, Speaker A: Question out of all of this, which is what is the economic objective of ethereum? Right. I mean, I've seen some interesting ones where it's trying to determine the different number of the different people in the ecosystem and how their preferences differ. And that could lower the, let's say, dollar amount of economic security that you have, because there's sort of a checks and balances type system where some people are, well, you have solo stakers and you have pooled stakers, right? Both with different preferences. So those are people that you can pit against one another. But it's a really hard question, and it informs all of this. So you're right on what I presented here was very simple, just to sort of drive the point home and sort of relate to what Sriram wrote, which most people are familiar with as the cost to attack the network. But I would love more ideas about how to formulate this problem because again, unless we know the objective, we can't manage the risk.
00:50:00.540 - 00:50:02.076, Speaker A: So I agree.
00:50:02.178 - 00:50:02.588, Speaker F: Thanks.
00:50:02.674 - 00:50:03.310, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:04.640 - 00:50:06.684, Speaker A: So yesterday there was a talk on.
00:50:06.722 - 00:50:08.268, Speaker D: Something similar on the model.
00:50:08.354 - 00:50:10.032, Speaker B: So what are like the fundamental difference.
00:50:10.086 - 00:50:24.630, Speaker A: Between your model and which was presented yesterday? Urban's model. Yeah, so Urban's model. It's a DSGE model, which I'm a former trader. Right. So I like to use. It's going to sound snarky. I like to use things at work.
00:50:24.630 - 00:51:18.656, Speaker A: DSG models haven't worked that well. So a lot of what I've done here is taken the macro and leverage quantitative finance with optimizations and potentially some more abstract things like a risk aversion parameter and things like that. But to me that's just to inform empirics, right. If you take away some of these more abstract terms, we can back out what the values actually are and what the stochastic dynamics are. But his model is obviously much more simplistic. I try and take into account everything from the micro and what's driving the problem problems on Ethereum, like potential centralization of stake or opening up to restaking, things like that. So what you've seen here is very much a work in progress and doesn't follow your prototypical.
00:51:18.656 - 00:51:58.080, Speaker A: Here's a DSGE model plug and play. I know a little bit, apply a little bit of Ethereum twist to it, and then you get a staking ratio. But again, the staking ratio is just one thing you're trying to optimize for here. Right? So taking into account the broader context of that is just one parameter really makes using a DSG, in my opinion, using a DSGE model very difficult to use. Thank you. Thanks. I'm curious if you've applied this model to other ecosystems, so say Solan or any other ecosystem, and if there would be big differences.
00:51:58.080 - 00:52:32.908, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. I've purposely not done that, and the reason I purposely not done that is there's been a bunch of work on proof of stake in general, not much on proof of stake in Ethereum. So I've been focusing on integrating the nitty gritty details of Ethereum into this model specifically. So I would assume the general gist of it, nobody uses really. I mean, Solana really doesn't have any convenience value, really. It's just not a good numerair. Right.
00:52:32.908 - 00:53:04.310, Speaker A: So obviously a lot more of the value is going to come now, especially coming from MeV for example, and potentially fees. But that's why the market cap is multiples less. But I think it can. Yes, but I haven't thought too much on it. It should in theory, abstracting away from some of the idiosyncratic design choices. How about bitcoin? It's just a convenience yield. Got you.
00:53:04.310 - 00:53:28.172, Speaker A: I'm being facetious. I think of it just all as just a convenience yield. Pretty much. So that's the entire term. But there's smarter people. Actually, urban has done an interesting model on bitcoin using traditional quantity theory of exchange type models, which is interesting. And I'm happy to chat with you after and send you the link over.
00:53:28.172 - 00:53:33.808, Speaker A: That'd be awesome. Yeah, but it's more or less convenience yield. I love it. I'm excited to read it.
00:53:33.894 - 00:53:34.530, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:36.820 - 00:53:54.292, Speaker D: I'll make it fast. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the convenience side and seeing what does that mean? The know Justin likes to talk about what's the difference between there and the last question. Know it's more abstraction, Paymaster concept become more prominent.
00:53:54.356 - 00:53:54.904, Speaker A: I'm sorry.
00:53:55.022 - 00:54:04.600, Speaker D: So basically people are not paying eth for gas anymore. Could be. And in those scenarios, would the convenience of ETH go down and will that impact the staking ratio?
00:54:05.580 - 00:54:29.604, Speaker A: Yes, but you always do need ETH to pay for gas, even if you're abstracting away from it. Right. So you can have a layer two who's like, you can pay me in USDC, but the layer two still has to pay for ETH. My personal opinion is ETH is not a good numerair. People price nfts and things like that denominate things in ETH. But realistically they're priced in dollars. Right? I don't think anybody has been like, yeah, I'm going to pay 100 ETH for this.
00:54:29.604 - 00:54:46.970, Speaker A: Regardless of in fiat. If you're from some other. Our entire consumption baskets are priced in fiat. Your first question. Sorry about the moneyness. That's a hard question. Yeah.
00:54:46.970 - 00:55:18.096, Speaker A: There's no way for supply to endogenously meet demand. It's always going to be very volatile. Right. So in the traditional system, I can go to the bank if I need money and I have some collateral and the bank creates essentially new money to me. So supply and demand is able to match more easily and naturally in a market environment. I mean, you want to throw the fed into it and things like that. But yeah, I think Nick Carter had a really good graph on.
00:55:18.096 - 00:55:47.084, Speaker A: Once stablecoins started becoming bigger and bigger things denominated in ETH as opposed to stablecoins, it plummeted the idea of moneyness in ETH. I think there's something there, and I think it could be state contingent. Right. If Argentina shits the bed and people really want something else, then you could see a spike in demand for things to nominate in ETH. But ultimately, fiat currencies are pretty good, at least the main developed ones.
00:55:47.282 - 00:55:48.220, Speaker D: All right, thank you.
00:55:48.290 - 00:55:55.580, Speaker B: Yeah, let's thank Brett again. And we have closing remarks.
00:55:56.260 - 00:56:28.404, Speaker G: Yeah, so that's all we have for you. So I want to close out the conference. I do want to take a couple moments to thank some people. First and foremost, I'd like to thank my co organizers, David E. Krappis, Justin Drake, Barnabay Mino, Mike Neuter, Tim Roughgarden and Danny Ryan. Let's thank them. Special shout out to Barnaby and Danny, who unfortunately couldn't make it.
00:56:28.404 - 00:56:58.212, Speaker G: We'd like to take a moment to thank the administrative staff. That's Kathleen Rithesorn, Julie Berger and Alexis Newman. They made everything run very smoothly, and we are very grateful. So thank you to them. And finally, I do just want to take a moment to advertise a conference we're holding here in May. That's going to be the inaugural TLDR conference, which we hope to make a premier destination for DeFi research. So that's going to be in May.
00:56:58.212 - 00:57:16.450, Speaker G: We will release a call for papers in January, so hope you can attend. Also hope you will submit some work, but there are some links to sign up for information from that. So with that, let me also thank all of you for attending and for making this conference what it was. Thank you.
