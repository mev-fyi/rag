00:00:13.530 - 00:01:15.780, Speaker A: GM, everyone, thank you for joining me today. Wanted to talk about on chain literacy and what we have been building recently at Zapper. So let's start with a little definition about what is on chain literacy. So basically means the ability to read and browse data and processes that occur on the blockchain, as well as the ability to interact with it. But in plain, simple words, it also means what the fuck is happening on chain? So why is on chain literacy so important for us at Zapper? Well, first of all, we believe that there is no future where crypto succeeds, where the masses are not on chain. So we're hoping for less usage of centralized exchanges, less reliance on centralized exchanges, and so just users interacting daily with the chain. So for you to be able to live on chain and interact with it on a daily basis, you need to be able to see what is happening, but also understand what is happening.
00:01:15.780 - 00:02:24.070, Speaker A: And another really important point for us is to level the playing field. What I mean by that is there is a huge gap right now in the knowledge and how some users in the ecosystem have a good knowledge of the blockchain, read it really well, so they're able to get the alpha before everyone else, be able to make very advantageous financial decisions before everyone else. And so we believe that by increasing on chain literacy, we'll be able to close this gap and so that everyone will be able to get the alpha. So you don't need to be a tech savvy person or shadowy supercoder or be part of a very private telegram fancy group to be able to get that alpha. You should be able to just read the chain like everyone else and just get that information from there. So there's a really good transition that is happening from online to on chain right now, where the users are now able to see what is happening behind closed doors, all thanks to the blockchain. So you have to see everything at all times forever registered.
00:02:24.070 - 00:03:07.858, Speaker A: So we want to provide those glasses, those on chain glasses that let you see and read what is happening without having those technical skills. So let's take a look at the current state of onchain literacy right now as it is today. There's a lot of terms that are really hard to grasp for newcomers. So not only we're expecting the users to learn a bunch of new words, a bunch of new ways of interactions, we're also pressing them to start interacting with the chain very quickly, which is great. They learn and they do mistakes. It's not often that we ask the users to actually understand the chain, read it and try to make a sense of it. At least that has been my experience.
00:03:07.858 - 00:04:08.442, Speaker A: And so on chain experience is very fragmented right now, where we're taking our understanding of web two and we're porting it into web three. This has been covered widely, how we're thinking of the chain as a very siloed experience. So you go on OpenSea, you check your NFTs, you go on a DAP website, you do some investments, then you go maybe on another website and you cast a vote in a dao. And so all of those are very siloed and different, where instead we should see this as a full journey, full user journey, where you're doing some stuff in the city, going from door to door and has to be fun and interactive. And so because reading the chain has such a high barrier to entry, we tend to rely on third parties. So most of us are on Twitter, we believe that the alpha is on Twitter. We're trying to find who we should be following, who has the latest news or maybe some cool telegram channels that people are adding us.
00:04:08.442 - 00:04:52.518, Speaker A: So this is where the alpha is. And so we're relying on this instead of relying on the chain. So there's all of those new words, new jargon, new user experiences, but also new ways of interacting with the data and the information. And all of those new things feel very complex. But it shouldn't be complex, it should be easy, should be transparent, just how the ecosystem wants it to be and shouldn't be complex. This is a really good representation of how we're seeing the interaction with the blockchain at the moment. So on one side you have users interacting very blindly with the blockchain.
00:04:52.518 - 00:06:02.110, Speaker A: So they see it as something that is opaque, scary, unknown, not a place where you get your alpha from, and also not a place that is very exciting to be, I would say. And so on the other side you have this discovery feeling where it's all exciting trending, where you're on Twitter, social media, and this is where everything is happening, right? So this is how we're feeling. I mean, most of the time, unless you're super tech savvy and you spend a lot of time reading the blogs. And so we have this distorted signal that is happening from what is happening actually on chain to being broadcasted to the social media masses. So because we're not really able to read the chain or read etherscan, we tend to get our information from there or get the information from someone else that is telling us what is actually happening on chain. We rely a lot on those people. And so what we've been trying to do at Zapper is to connect all of those dots and also bridge the gap of on chain literacy.
00:06:02.110 - 00:06:37.754, Speaker A: Zapper has been known also as a DeFi dashboard where you get to see all of your assets in one place. But now the big step is to make everything more readable from on ethereum. So let's take a look at what we have been doing recently. Screenshots here. So we've been taking first step, we were like, okay, let's take all of those complex transactions that are happening. We're already doing a lot of the reading on Zapper. So if you have a position, you entered a position in a pool, you'll be able to see it on Zapper in a readable way.
00:06:37.754 - 00:07:16.870, Speaker A: You'll see how much you put in. But now we wanted to do the interaction part. So you'll have a transaction of something that happened. At the top, you'll see the screenshot of Etherscan, which is an amazing tool that really shows what is the chain, how it's working, how it's live in real time. It's also a tool that can be quite techy, hard to use for some. And so at the bottom, you'll see a screenshot of how we interpreted that same transaction in a readable way. And so you see, now that this wallet has refinanced, did an interaction with the smart contract, it's really clear everyone can read it.
00:07:16.870 - 00:07:41.806, Speaker A: And so we've been doing a lot of those interpretation. Why? To build an activity feed. So think of your Twitter feed, the place where everything is so exciting and vibrant. But think of Ethereum feed. So you get to see everything that is happening on chain. You get to follow wallets that you want to follow. Follow your friends.
00:07:41.806 - 00:08:25.390, Speaker A: So you get to see what they're doing, what they're buying, what they're minting, everything. And so now the chain starts to feel a bit more active, more vibrant, more social as well. So it's not this opaque place that you don't really want to go. You don't want to go and read the blocks. And so our activity feed, we were able to interpret 90% of all Ethereum transactions right now. So if you go on the activity feed and you scroll on it, 90% is readable human, readable transactions, which is great, but we still need to cover that 10%. So the way we decided to tackle it is to create an Event interpreter.
00:08:25.390 - 00:08:51.142, Speaker A: An Event interpreter means that anyone can submit an interpretation of the event, of what happened. So you'll see the screenshot, it says did something. It means that we haven't interpreted what that wallet did with the smart contract. We don't know exactly. We have the transaction, we can go and see it on Etherscan and anyone can interpret it. So you get to interpret the event. For this case, it's a quite simple one.
00:08:51.142 - 00:09:45.942, Speaker A: Some of them are a bit more complex. So this one withdrew some tokens from Convex. So this event is submitted, approved by our team, and you're good to go. What's really, really cool about our event interpretation, it's not that you're interpreting for yourself one Event, it really acts like many on chain indexers. So what I mean by that is, once this withdrew from Convex is interpreted, all other occurrences of that same event at all times, even if you go in the past from other wallets, is going to be interpreted as well. So one single interpretation can result in thousands of readable events and this is how we're getting that 10% long tail events that we haven't covered. And then at some point, hopefully we reach 100% where you're scrolling on the feed and you see just everything that is happening on the chain in real time.
00:09:45.942 - 00:10:23.410, Speaker A: No need for technical skills. Okay, a little bit of alpha here. We will be launching trends soon. Trends on zapper the screenshot looks a little bit like maybe the front page of Reddit where when you land, you quickly see what is trending on the internet, right? So you get to see what people are searching, what people are talking about. Same thing. But instead of that, you see what's trending on Ethereum at the moment. So maybe you want to know why is gas so high, why the network is congested at the moment.
00:10:23.410 - 00:10:57.566, Speaker A: It's really hard to get that information from Twitter. You can get a sense of what's going on if there's like a big mint, but it's still tricky here. It's going to be instant. What is hot and trending, what memecoin users are buying right now, what NFT is minting. So with the trends, you'll be able to see all of that. What we did basically is that all those events interpretation that you saw, we aggregated them together and we surfaced those trends for specific time frames. So you can look at what's trending for 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours.
00:10:57.566 - 00:11:36.746, Speaker A: That gives you a really good sense and a good pulse of what is happening on Ethereum right now. It's pretty cool and it has really good alpha. So how are we seeing the future of that? We're seeing the future as being on chain feels very vibrant. A good analogy is that you're in this city and you're in a town hall and everyone meets. There gathers, there, exchange, you see everything, what's happening. You don't need to go on a third party on Twitter where people interacted on the chain and then went on Twitter and said, hey, this is what I did on chain, I minted this. You don't need that part.
00:11:36.746 - 00:12:14.680, Speaker A: It's just there for everyone to see. And so should just be general excitement and good vibes instead of feeling opaque and maybe even non active. Even if the chain is very active, when you look at it, you feel like there's nothing going on and this is not the place that you would want to see at the source what is happening. You'll rely on others to tell you what is happening. So this is how we're seeing the future. And we think that to obtain that future, we need to make the chain more readable for everyone and not just a small group. Thank you.
00:12:14.680 - 00:12:25.020, Speaker A: I don't know if there is any questions.
00:12:28.510 - 00:12:32.010, Speaker B: How'S that gonna work. Is that gonna depend on the light.
00:12:32.080 - 00:12:37.770, Speaker A: Or yeah, it's fine. I heard you. You mean the trends?
00:12:37.930 - 00:12:38.640, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:41.650 - 00:13:16.540, Speaker A: Actually. So what's going to push the trends is going to be the number of time that the event occurred. And so it has nothing to do with the social likes, really. If we constantly see the minting of that NFT collection, for example, for that hour, every time that this event shows, it's going to feed into the number. Fully on chain. Yeah. The social part, when you say like liking the social part, will only be where you can follow wallets, just like you follow people on Twitter and so you get to see what they're doing.
00:13:16.540 - 00:13:20.540, Speaker A: Yeah, fully on chain. Yeah.
00:13:31.870 - 00:14:01.814, Speaker B: Hi. Yeah. So it seems that most analysis are based on quantitative data. Right. Are you thinking to add some qualitative signals to the identities behind these addresses? Like, I can see a lot of activity over a token, but I don't know how many bots are producing that. So a lot of the things that happen on change doesn't really reflect real life. Right.
00:14:01.814 - 00:14:09.130, Speaker B: There is a lot of synthetic transactions. So do you foresee adding some qualitative signals to produce a noise?
00:14:09.790 - 00:14:33.860, Speaker A: That's a really good point for now. No, I think that there is some bots, yes. But you'll still see and get a really good feel of the actual transactions that are happening because just going to overtake by volume right now. It's really simple for us. It's just like the first step was the interpretation. Maybe I didn't get your question.
00:14:35.190 - 00:14:56.738, Speaker B: But then if you are not filtering the synthetic activity, this can also be used as a tool for manipulating the perception. Right? Because if I can create a lot of traffic and you are magnifying that by showing that there is a lot of traffic, right. You're basically giving the people behind the bot farms a new tool to create hype.
00:14:56.914 - 00:15:26.380, Speaker A: Totally, yeah. We've seen this on the internet where you create the fake volume and everything. So I think the step after this is going to find a way to filter it, which is going to be a bit tricky, but I think there's some ways around it where we'll have to find the real interaction instead of the fake interaction that the user well, the bots are broadcasting for us, so for sure. Yeah. Thank you.
