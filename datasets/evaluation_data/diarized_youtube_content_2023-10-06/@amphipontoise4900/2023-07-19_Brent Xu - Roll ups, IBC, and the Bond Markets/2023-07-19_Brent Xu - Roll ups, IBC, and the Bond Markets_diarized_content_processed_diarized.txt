00:00:26.210 - 00:00:47.974, Speaker A: Awesome. Let's get started, everyone. It's nice to see you out there. My name is Brent. I'm the founder of Umi, and I'm going to be giving a talk on Cosmos, Ethereum and the bond markets. So who here loves ethereum? I'm sure everyone here loves Ethereum. I love Ethereum, though I also love Cosmos as well.
00:00:47.974 - 00:01:37.174, Speaker A: My background is prior to this, I was the head of strategy at Tendermint, the creators of Cosmos, and subsequent to that, I launched Umi, which is the largest lending protocol in the Cosmos ecosystem. We're also being considered to be the official money market of the Cosmos ecosystem via the atom economic zone. But before all that I was an early employee at Consensus. Helped build a company from 20 people to 1200 in the early days. Traveled the world of Joe Lubin in terms of promoting Ethereum. Tried to get Ethereum listed on centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Okx, Huawei, Kraken, Poloniax just all the exchanges as well as tried to get enterprises like Morgan to utilize Ethereum. And throughout that experience, you realize that the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems have a lot of similarities.
00:01:37.174 - 00:02:20.762, Speaker A: And I came to one major conclusion that Cosmos and Ethereum were meant to be friends. And it really clicked for me one day when I was putting together a dinner at DevCon in Osaka back in 2019, where we sat down with Vitalik, Justin Drake, Danny Ryan, along with Jay Kwan, Zaki Manion, Chris Ghost, Changle and myself. And we talked about how IBC can be used for cross shard communication for Ethereum 2.0 shards. This is a talk that Vitalik and J Kwan gave on interoperability between the ecosystems back at DevCon 2019 in Osaka. Chris Goes also gave a talk about IBC and Ethereum 2.0 at EFCC a few years ago, back in 2020.
00:02:20.762 - 00:02:50.526, Speaker A: As you know, Anoma is a sponsor of this event this year. And then chorgios from paradigm. Also tweeted about how IBC can be implemented in solidity, which just goes to show that there's a lot of cryptographic similarities between the cosmos ecosystem and the ethereum ecosystem to a point where, let's say if ethereum 2.0 never really launched. You'd have this sort of ETH 1.5 thesis or ETH 1.5 vision where you have data availability sharded execution environments and roll ups.
00:02:50.526 - 00:03:41.038, Speaker A: And the more and more you look at this ETH 1.5 vision, the more it looks like cosmos, to the point where you can even think of cosmos as sort of this blueprint for where ethereum can go towards a note. John Adler he said at one point that we live in a multi chain world and this is an important concept to understand. In order to be successful in this crypto ecosystem, you need to embrace MultiChain thesis, because eventually we're going to have interoperability. We're going to have seamless movements of assets from one chain to another. We're going to have homogenized execution environments that can execute in parallel, and we're going to have scalable architecture, basically able to onboard a lot of assets from the real world into the crypto ecosystem. Take an example from the development of Internet.
00:03:41.038 - 00:04:07.926, Speaker A: When Darpinet was first created. You had a bunch of intranets, and things didn't really click until you had the Internet that was connected via a common communication protocol called TCPIP. And that's what sparked the growth of the Internet. Blockchain needs to reach that stage, and it needs to have that TCPIP moment. Now, I am a capitalist at heart. I do believe in public goods. I do believe in open source infrastructure.
00:04:07.926 - 00:04:48.342, Speaker A: I believe in open source code. But a lot of these ecosystems need to figure out a way to make money as well. Prior to crypto, I spent over half a decade trading bonds. I'm very familiar with the debt capital markets, and the bond market is the largest market in the world, and it's the foundation for the overall capital markets. And you need to build many frameworks around these. For example, you can do cross chain borrowing and lending. Imagine leveraging assets on Cosmos, borrowing on Ethereum, leveraging assets on Ethereum, borrowing on L two, leverage on asset on L two, borrowing on L three, essentially creating this omnilending hub of activity of just constant usage between different chains.
00:04:48.342 - 00:05:28.070, Speaker A: This is possible using a lot of these crosschain technologies. Also, consider the concept of the time value of money. So in traditional finance, you price opportunity costs based on a yield curve or a term structure, interest rates in which you price opportunity costs. In crypto, that is also possible. You're able to use things such as proof of stake rates, as well as liquidity mining as mechanisms to describe opportunity costs and also create a time value of crypto assets. And I'd say in building out these future ecosystems, you need to take this into consideration as you're valuing the next generation of crypto. And third off, I believe in a MultiChain bond market.
00:05:28.070 - 00:06:12.174, Speaker A: So fixed income assets need to move seamlessly between different chain ecosystems so yields can be distributed between one ecosystem to another. This will dictate the foundation of how we move the net set of values into the crypto ecosystem. Back to that TCPIP intranet versus Internet example. As blockchains come together, they're going to form the basis of being able to establish a market such as what I just described. Now, in order to get there, you actually need a few things. And I have a proposal. It's a very nuanced proposal, but I think that two of the biggest, most popular development ecosystems in crypto have a lot of strategic alignment that they can achieve.
00:06:12.174 - 00:06:47.918, Speaker A: And here's my proposal. What if Cosmos and Ethereum were to merge? And I don't mean merging the actual chains. I mean merging the development environments, merging the development roadmaps, merging the technical roadmaps, the technical timelines, and figure out more alignment between Cosmos and Ethereum? I'll give a few examples of how this is already happening. So look at roll ups via the Op stack. So right now, you're able to launch your own L two S via Op coinbase. Async Z are already doing this. Starkware and Zksync are allowing you to launch L three S.
00:06:47.918 - 00:07:07.502, Speaker A: This is already happening. And this idea was championed by the Cosmos SDK, where you're able to launch your own L One. Does that sound familiar? How about this? You also need a communication protocol. So L two S. L three S. They need a way to send assets back and forth. Bridges are not the safest solution.
00:07:07.502 - 00:07:43.498, Speaker A: Bridges. You've seen billions of dollars get lost in bridge hacks because a lot of times, they can gravitate towards centralization. They can be proof of authority networks, lock and mint mechanisms, exposed risks. Instead, it's better to have an underlying communication protocol that integrates directly into the state machine to allow transfers of assets. So Cosmos has already built something for this. It's called IBC. It's basically a module in the same machine of one chain that relays messages to a module of the same machine of another that acts as this transfer authentication ordering layer that separates out the application side of the protocol from the communication side of the protocol.
00:07:43.498 - 00:08:13.414, Speaker A: What this means is that you're able to transfer assets between different chains very fast and very effectively. And this is something that should be shared with the ethereum ecosystem, and another reason why I think the roadmaps are merged. Third, let's consider sequencers. So, sequencers right now are fairly centralized, and one idea for decentralizing them is to use a BFT consensus protocol. And that's something that the Cosmos ecosystem has also developed. It's called tendermint. It's been developed since 2013.
00:08:13.414 - 00:08:53.590, Speaker A: 2014. J, Kwan and Vitalik were on some of the same panels back in the day to talk about development of these protocols. It's also a lot of the research informed Casper. And so from all these vantage points, it just shows that we're building with the same cryptographic primitives, and it exposes an ecosystem where we should be trying to achieve this superchain thesis. Basically an environment where these development roadmaps and timelines are merging and the developer ecosystems are working together to build this homogeneous network. At Umi, we're already doing this. So take oho, for example.
00:08:53.590 - 00:10:01.200, Speaker A: Oho is the first Oracle built as a blockchain. It is a universal Oracle, a price feed that allows the access of any blockchain or any DeFi protocol to access smart Oracle price feeds. So by using IBC Queries, a price feeder, custom relayers, indexers, WebSocket API, as well as a smart Oracle price feed, we're able to instantiate a whole new world of price information for the Oracle ecosystem. So oho is currently the Official Oracle of Cosmos. It's establishing as, Beachhead and Cosmos, but it's directly integratable into EVMs L2 S, l Three S, side chain architectures, alternative base layer solutions, rust based chains, as well as Move VM based chains. So from this vantage, point, oho intends to onboard several new real world assets into the crypto ecosystem. New price feeds essentially onboarding billions of dollars of new price information into the crypto ecosystem to allow more use cases throughout the world.
00:10:01.200 - 00:10:32.146, Speaker A: We're also building taboo. So taboo is the interchange super app. It is the official interchange mobile wallet. Right now, in the broader fintech and banking world, 72% of users are mobile. In the developing worlds right now, there's a lack of computer usage. Everyone prefers to have access to their banking directly in the palm of their hands. Through Taboo, you have a universal UI to access all of your crypto.
00:10:32.146 - 00:11:17.426, Speaker A: Instead of having to switch between one blockchain to another, you're able to access everything into one universal interface. You're able to have all your DeFi applications and all your crypto applications on one user interface. And this basically gives you a command center to access crypto. Basically an aggregator that combines DEXs DeFi lending, NFTs, staking, stablecoins all in a universal UI for you to access. And Taboo is just another example of we see the cosmos and the ethereum ecosystems colliding and interoperating. We see a world where you can have all of these applications in a universal UI instead of just using a wallet for just simply signing your transactions. A note on staking derivatives.
00:11:17.426 - 00:12:32.830, Speaker A: So staking derivatives are a very important part of this ecosystem. In the next bull runs, proof of stake will be a key component of how we view crypto, and it will define the future of consensus for how distributed systems would operate. And so similar to in TradFi, where you're taking US dollars or fiat currencies, depositing them into an instrument and access rates, you're able to take proof of stake assets, deposit them into a proof of stake protocol, access staking derivatives, and access the proof of stake rate. These rates are a very powerful concept in our broader financial world because a rate essentially dictates what is known as an opportunity cost or a way that you discount cash flows, a way that you define time value. And so by being able to take proof of stake rates and, for example, create time tranches of these and structure them, for example, you take a proof of stake rate, structure it for one month, two months, six months, twelve months, two years, five years, ten years, 30 years. You're able to create what is known as a proof of stake term structure of interest rates or term structure of proof of stake rates, effectively valuing the time related to these staking assets. So imagine a world where you're able to go, for example, long the ten year bond, short the ten year staking rate.
00:12:32.830 - 00:13:00.422, Speaker A: This creates arbitrage, basically new markets that crypto and traditional finance can interoperate in. And it all requires a homogeneous new superchain thesis. A note on stablecoins. So stablecoins and bonds are really two sides of the same coin. The only thing that separates a bond from a stablecoin is actually the time between them. And so you already see this transformation MakerDAO. Recently, they purchased a billion of US.
00:13:00.422 - 00:13:35.930, Speaker A: Treasuries. You see more tokenized treasury platforms integrating directly into DeFi protocols. You have AMMS where you can trade between Treasuries and stablecoins and different yielding assets. This is the future, and this is where the next billion dollar markets are going to come from. Basically a yielding ecosystem where you're able to see an interrelated network of staking yields as well as interest rate yields all coalescing into a unified network. A note on the financial market. So prior to crypto, I spent over half a decade trading bonds.
00:13:35.930 - 00:14:22.640, Speaker A: And you don't really get this illusion by the financial markets unless you spend a lot of time on a bond trading desk. Because at the end of the day, what you learn is that the source of all the alpha, the source of all the value that's generated a lot of times is from a lack of transparency. It's from the opaqueness or the black box system that you're working in. And nothing was more motivating to join crypto, where you have a decentralized open source transparent system than to experience some of the follies of the traditional finance world. So a lot of this motivated me to want to join crypto and establish more open source frameworks. The last note I'll leave you guys with is real world financial markets. We already see it coming.
00:14:22.640 - 00:15:08.830, Speaker A: BlackRock, Fidelity, Van Eck, they're all establishing Bitcoin ETFs, and they're all bringing real institutional capital into crypto. The next few bull cycles might be semi regulated, but the main takeaway I want folks to get is that I believe that all financial markets, and I mean all financial markets, will eventually move to crypto and blockchain. Considering that it's a more effective open source settlement layer, it's more powerful than what we see in traditional Rails. This is the future. And in order to achieve that vision, like I said, all financial markets eventually moving into crypto and DeFi. You need different chains like Cosmos and Ethereum to work together. You need an interrelated development ecosystem, and you need to build in the same directions.
00:15:08.830 - 00:15:19.980, Speaker A: On that note, thank you so much for your time. I really enjoyed speaking to you guys. Have a great conference, everyone. I'll be free later to answer questions, but thank you so much and have a good one.
