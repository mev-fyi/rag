00:00:19.210 - 00:00:43.740, Speaker A: We need one of those too. Hi, everyone. I'm uri Clarman. I'm the CEO and co founder of Blocksroute. Thank you everybody, for coming. And today we'll be talking about how maybe Mev can help DeFi instead of destroying it. And we're going to use a bunch of Memes because it's fun, but also it leaves the right mental model in mind.
00:00:43.740 - 00:01:40.880, Speaker A: But before we get started, why even listen to me? So, I've been in crypto since 2016. I took an academic idea, Blocks Route, from my PhD thesis and created a company out of it. And Blocks route is a major actor in DFI and Mev. In the last bull market, we were routing for our customers something like one and a half billion dollars of trades per day. That's like 40% of all DFI that was happening on all chains. We built front running protection before Flashbot even existed. We run an Mev block builder, we run an Mev relay, we work with searcher, we work with DeFi traders anywhere from Jump and Winter Mutant, GSR, and you name it, to a solo searcher in a basement in Taiwan and anywhere in between.
00:01:40.880 - 00:02:23.610, Speaker A: But beyond all of that, I really care about DeFi. I think DeFi is important. I think we need a global, always on transparent, single financial infrastructure, and we can't mess it up. And so I want to start with my issue with Mev and my issue with Mev auctions specifically. It really came to my mind when FTX imploded. FTX imploded, it took a bunch of CFI actors with it, am I right? No, it's fine. It took a bunch of CFI actors with it, not DeFi actors.
00:02:23.610 - 00:03:10.018, Speaker A: But it did make me realize that DeFi did fail. DeFi failed to be good enough. It failed to be an alternative so people would go and use DeFi products instead of keeping their money in FTX Mount Gox if you go back enough. And the reason that they kept their money there is a bit bizarre. Like we all know, exchanges blow up, right? It's no surprise. We've been here for long enough. And so if you think, what do we need in order for DeFi to be successful and actually compete with CFI, not just be a cartwheel running behind CFI, DeFi needs to be useful.
00:03:10.018 - 00:03:47.122, Speaker A: Now, if I take $1,000 and I want to buy ETH, I don't need to be faster than Jump, okay? Or winter moot or whoever. I don't need to identify the picosecond that the price just went down slightly and make the best trade. I'm not looking for that. But I do want, and I do need to get the current correct price, right? I don't know what that price is. I don't have five monitors looking at all the different venues all around the world and how they're volatile and whatnot. I don't know, I don't care. I want to give $1,000 and get ETH, and I also don't want to get front run.
00:03:47.122 - 00:04:22.174, Speaker A: I don't want the current correct price to change because I'm about to make a trade. If I can get that from DeFi, then thank you very much, but I'm staying with Coinbase, quite literally, okay? Why would I buy ETH on uniswap or wherever if when I go to Coinbase, I know there are arbitragers. If the price is off, they will immediately correct it. I know I always get the current correct price. And this is where it goes to the mev auctions. Mev auctions are a negative sum game. They're not a zero sum game.
00:04:22.174 - 00:05:04.206, Speaker A: They're a negative sum game because Validators try to extract as much value as they can from DeFi users and DeFi LPs. Mev isn't money from thin air, okay? This is money being taken from somebody. And if Validators extract that value from DeFi users, then DeFi is now worse. It is less useful than what it was. And if it's less useful and is worse, then it's going to have less activity and less liquidity. And funny enough, the Validators are actually going to end up with less mev because we just shrink the pie. So you really can think about it.
00:05:04.206 - 00:05:41.334, Speaker A: That an auction. What an auction does is that it maximizes the slice that the Validators get right there's. An auction, somebody offers me this amount, somebody tops him, and I will take who eventually, the Validator extracts most of the value. But in the process of running an auction, we make the pie a lot smaller. Now avoid TradFi latency Games has a really nice ring to it, okay? I actually believed that for about a year, a year and a half. It makes sense. We're building DeFi.
00:05:41.334 - 00:06:18.926, Speaker A: It is a new system. We don't want to rebuild Trodfi. It's bad. There are all these high frequency traders who are extracting money and front running actors, and it's closed, and it's not open for everybody. So it makes sense that we don't want to rebuild that. But what we end up really building is a system which on the one hand is slow and less useful, and on the other hand, normalizes front running. So the bad thing about TradFi, the really bad thing isn't that it's fast, isn't that there are arbitragers.
00:06:18.926 - 00:07:09.366, Speaker A: It's a good thing that there are arbitrage. They make sure everybody who wants to trade get the current correct price. The bad thing is somebody sees your trade and gets ahead of you, and now we're saying, oh, that's fine, that's part of, like, this is part of the model. But I don't want slow, less useful DeFi with front running. I want to get the current correct price when I'm trading. So I honestly think even though there are a lot of great people who I really like are working on mev auctions, mev auctions are pushing people from DeFi out to CFI, okay? They maximize the Validator slice by making the pie smaller, and they make DeFi less useful. And as I started by saying this is serious stuff.
00:07:09.366 - 00:07:48.934, Speaker A: This means that in two years we're going to have another FTX, okay? If we continue down that road, nobody's going to use DeFi by default because it suck and they'll stay with that and we're going to have run through the same story again. Now, I want to give an anecdote about bitcoin about BTC. It doesn't matter if you like it or don't like it. If you think it's a Petrock or it's awesome, it doesn't really matter. But if you look at CFI, BTC volume is twice as high than ETH volume. There's a lot of activity there. But if you look at DeFi, half a percent, 2% of that volume trickles into DeFi.
00:07:48.934 - 00:08:21.914, Speaker A: The rest of it is happening on CFI. Why? Why do we see activity and liquidity of ETH? ETH USDC, it is the largest pool. Half of all DFI activity is that uniswap pool. ETH USDC five basis point on uniswap. Because this room is filled with Etheads who like ETH and like DeFi and want this to succeed and willing to try all sorts of stuff. So we take ETH and we LP and we try all sorts of stuff. So there is some liquidity, but we see that BTC holders do trade it.
00:08:21.914 - 00:09:00.998, Speaker A: It's not about holdling and not giving it away. They do trade it, but they trade it on CFI because it's useful. It's better. Okay? If DeFi was better, if lpng was actually very good, people would take their BTC, wrap it to wrapped BTC or something and use it in DeFi. Not because of an agenda, because it's better, because it pays better. So to summarize this, and I really like this picture auctions maximize the value that Validators get and PBS makes sure that that value doesn't stay with the evil high frequency traders. No, no, it goes to the Validators.
00:09:00.998 - 00:09:31.540, Speaker A: And we have Mfburn coming up soon, probably. Where's Justin? I didn't see him here. All that means squat to DeFi users, okay? That's money that's being taken from them and like, well, let's redistribute it. It doesn't matter how you redistribute it, you make DeFi worse. Now you could come and say, well, ori doesn't mev add something? Even so, like what about Jeet liquidity? Just in time. Liquidity. Somebody is about to make a trade and then somebody puts the trade more liquidity into that.
00:09:31.540 - 00:10:31.714, Speaker A: So JIT liquidity is strongly adverse selecting, okay, when would you counter trade somebody else when that somebody else is making a terrible trade? Okay? So you'll get JIT liquidity for all the bad trades that trade in the wrong direction. But if there is a trade in the right direction, nobody will add liquidity there and make a bad trade on purpose. It doesn't make sense. So you'll have liquidity standing on the sidelines, not really participating and only allowing for bad trades to happen. And if you go towards, well, what about yes, there is front running and we normalized it but I make a trade and then I get an Mev rebate, I get some of that money back. Isn't that good enough? Or what about intent? Like, I want to sell a want to ETH in return and try to get as much as I can. All that really boils down to an RFQ system, okay? Request for quotes.
00:10:31.714 - 00:11:29.750, Speaker A: And if you want that, we already have that. Shout out to Hashflow. I don't know if Victor is here somewhere, okay? Hashflow takes Winter, Mute and Jump and anybody who wants to participate in GSR and whoever and pit them against one another and whoever would give you the best quote, they would give you that you can get an RFQ system. And RFQ systems are great for some purposes, okay? They're great if I am a user and I want to make this thousand dollar for ETH. But always RFQ systems are indirect DeFi and they'll be worse than direct DeFi like markets, like clubs, like AMMS, because whoever gives an RFQ has to make a profit, right? They'll give you an RFQ and they'll trade it on the other side, on the real CFI, on Binance or Coinbase or wherever. So they will make a profit. And you need to also compensate them a bit for the risk.
00:11:29.750 - 00:12:11.094, Speaker A: So by definition, this thing would never compete with CFI. It would keep DeFi as a sidecard to sorry, it would keep DeFi as a sidecar to CFI. CFI would be the real thing where things are happening, and DeFi would be the sidecart. We need direct DeFi. So this part was, oh, boy, do I hate mev. Auctions okay, smartass, you said this is bad, but what are you actually offering an alternative to that? Here's the idea. What if we offer validators, instead of capturing most of the value out there, 90% of a small pie, we have them.
00:12:11.094 - 00:13:14.390, Speaker A: Well, you capture some half 50% of a much larger pie, ten x bigger, 100 x bigger. And to set the mental model right around it, we're talking about very vanilla ethereum, okay? There is no metatransactions, which are being auctioned to searchers, who then create bundles which go to block builders on an Mev focused L one or something like that, like no validators build blocks. The good old way. And I want to talk a bit about, okay, where I'm taking it. I'm not starting here, but what direction am I taking us in this proposal that I'm giving here? Validators build blocks, okay? No relays, no block builders, no other L ones, no token, nothing like that. Validators build blocks, users make transactions. No metatransactions, no protected RPCs, no private order flow, no auctions.
00:13:14.390 - 00:13:48.310, Speaker A: Pretty simple. And validators make more money offering services to these users than they would if they were front running them and extracting value from them. And when I say services, first and foremost, I mean instant inclusion, which I'll explain in a second. There are other services as well. Think like real time trade routing, a few other stuff. But we don't have time for that today. So we'll stick with the first and foremost instant inclusion.
00:13:48.310 - 00:14:18.382, Speaker A: What's instant inclusion? Think about it that the validator receive transaction and in real time provide pre confirmation, first come, first served, fair ordering transaction come. And this is one, and this is two, and this is three. And this is four. And this is five. Now, sure, uri, but that doesn't solve the problem of mev. Because if the validator would see a transaction that's about to buy ETH for a million dollar, it would inject their own transaction. We're back to square one.
00:14:18.382 - 00:14:53.158, Speaker A: It will try to take advantage of that transaction. So we talk about something that re jewels from Cornell built. It's called themis. Themis is a very simple system. I'll outline it in three sentences. Themis is the idea that instead of the proposer organizing the transaction in a block, the proposer only gets to aggregate what all the other validators saw. So all the validators see transaction and once they oh, I saw 12345, sign it, send it to the proposer.
00:14:53.158 - 00:15:44.966, Speaker A: This guy saw 1235, he didn't see four. So we send that and the proposer can play with that. It can only aggregate what the majority of the network had seen with signatures and whatnot, et cetera, it can play with it. And putting my networking PhD hat on, you could also use such a system to completely prevent front running by broadking transactions slightly smarter. Okay? If I want to make a transaction, I broadcast it to all the validator. But instead of starting from the closest one, I start by sending it to the one who's on the other side of the world and gradually send it to the other validators over a course of something like 70 80 millisecond. Why 70 80 millisecond? That means that if I'm getting to the closest one and that guy is jumped, okay, he sees my transaction picosecond.
00:15:44.966 - 00:16:16.930, Speaker A: After that, he took that, he created the front running transaction. He sent it as fast as humanly possible to the other side of the world. My transaction has a 70 millisecond advantage over him. He would never beat me. Light of speed is playing in my part. You can't beat somebody to the other side of the world if he started 70 80 milliseconds ahead of you with at least basic routing. And so, if you actually go to Jump crypto and look at their website, jump's largest obstacle is the speed of light.
00:16:16.930 - 00:16:59.026, Speaker A: You can like if there's an exchange, one here and the other is there, they could only go at the speed of light. Between them, there is something that they cannot solve. So taking a step back for a second but the high level idea validator build blocks user send transaction with some smarter broadcast and validators capture basis points. They're being paid for this service. Why would they accept transaction like that? Because they're being paid now you could ask is it worth it? Would it pay more than just like front running the users? Should they do that? And here's why it makes sense. I wonder if this works, by the way. Let's see if I click it.
00:16:59.026 - 00:17:37.886, Speaker A: No, it's a PDF. That animation died. There is a lot more activity, something like ten times more activity between the start of the block and the end of the block or during that block than if you just look at the start at the point and look at the delta. So if you look at the example here, price started one, then it went down, it went up, it went down, it went up, it went down, et cetera, and eventually finished five and a half basis points later. And then in the Mev auction, somebody would send a transaction, would capture that arbitrage, the Validator would capture more of that. And let's say the Validator captured 90% out of that. We'll see in a second why that's not actually true.
00:17:37.886 - 00:18:26.974, Speaker A: But let's say that they're getting it. But if you have ten times more activity happening there, and the Validator makes money on all these trades going up and down and up and down and up and down not all the money, some money, but there is ten times more activity, then it just pays it better. So for the LP, if you're LP in such a system, instead of making one terrible trade every 12 seconds, you make a lot of trades. A lot, a lot more. Half of them are actually good trades because price went up, one price went down, eventually yield will go in one direction or the other, and all the buys you went in that direction were actually good ones. If you look at the user, if you have arbitrators, as price goes, they keep correcting the price. Price go up, they buy, price go down, they sell, and et cetera, and correcting the price.
00:18:26.974 - 00:18:50.578, Speaker A: Then you as the user can get your current correct price. I send a transaction and I know the price that I'm going to hit is the correct one. Because if it wasn't correct, somebody would have sent a transaction to capture that arbitrage. You'll also get immediate result. You send a transaction, you actually know what you got back. You don't get front run. Validators make more money because you get more liquidity, you get more activity.
00:18:50.578 - 00:19:34.260, Speaker A: And more than anything else, I think the things that I really get excited about is that it changed the dynamics between CFI and DFI. Right now, DFI is a sidecar being dragged by CFI. So CFI moves in real time, price always changes all the time, and then every 12 seconds DFI changes and kind of like, okay, catches up. If DFI moves with instant inclusion, then all of a sudden this is bi directional, just like some the price on Coinbase affect Binance and Binance affect Coinbase and they affect OKEx, DeFi all of a sudden is an equal member there. If somebody buys on DeFi, it changes the price, it affects others. It's not the sidecart. It's in equal points or in equal position as the rest of them.
00:19:34.260 - 00:20:04.894, Speaker A: Now stop here for a second. All of that that I just talked about doesn't mean anything if Validators don't make more money. If Validator make more money this way, then they'll do it because they'll do what makes them more money. The guy from DVT before that kind of mentioned it. Validators don't really have a choice. They will extract as much money as they can because if they don't, then people won't stick with them. They'll stick with somebody else who has 0.1
00:20:04.894 - 00:20:30.440, Speaker A: more higher APY. So they will do whatever pays them the most. They're good actors, they don't want to screw over users. But sometimes they don't really have a chance or sorry a choice. So the question is, can it pay Validators more? That's the only question. Now if you look here, this is coming from Frontier who are awesome, Anjit and Stefan who I love. Both.
00:20:30.440 - 00:20:58.960, Speaker A: You remember that we talked about that. Well, you have an auction and it maximizes the value that Validators are getting. Turns out that's not really true. If you look here at the red line behind me, that's the atomic arbitrage, okay? There is some opportunity. Everybody are competing with it about it. It's super competitive and people outbid one another. And Validators capture 91% to 99% of the value.
00:20:58.960 - 00:21:47.200, Speaker A: But 60% of mev is actually CFI DFI arbitrage and CFI DFI arbitrage is risky and it requires capital. Okay? You don't know that you're going to win. You're going to have to make a trade on CFI and you're going to make a trade on DFI. And turns out that they only pass 55% on average of the mev to the Validator. So we build this whole mev auction thing. Validator don't even capture all the money Validator make if you kind of like round it all up something like 66% of all the value. So first of all, Validators don't make as much money as you might think because most of the mev is c arbitrage and just half of that money goes to them.
00:21:47.200 - 00:22:25.580, Speaker A: Now, the second point is if we build this and it's useful, then we'll get more liquidity and more activity. The more liquidity and more activity you have. If you think about like Validator mental thing, they capture one basis point. We get more liquidity, we get more activity, they make more money. If we double the amount of liquidity, they double the amount of money that they're making. If we make the pie bigger, ten x 100 x, that's way better than capturing 50% rather than 66%. So the only thing that matters is whether Validator would make more money this way.
00:22:25.580 - 00:22:58.162, Speaker A: Staying with the metallica theme, enter Sandbox. Okay, I was trying to think, can we try this? Forget about STEMIs. Forget about decentralization. I don't want any of it. This is like next year or two years or something. Can we do a POC? Can we check whether Validators actually make more money this way? So I was thinking of like, can we sandbox a market outside of the Med auction? And I came up with all sorts of ways to do it. And then uniswap came with hooks.
00:22:58.162 - 00:23:15.674, Speaker A: Like, wait, I can use hooks. Hooks could pay to a validator. Hooks would decide on whatever fee you want. Really exciting stuff. And then I realized that Ambient already have all that on Mainet. So Ambient used to be crocswap. I'm very glad that they changed the name.
00:23:15.674 - 00:23:41.220, Speaker A: I kept conflating it with cowswap. Ambient has swaps and the singleton and built in order limits. It's already live on Mainet and it's open source and it's kind of like I'm not invested in any of it. I like, Doug was, this is great. We could play with this. So I decided this is what I'm working on. And I'm hacking with Doug and the ambient team.
00:23:41.220 - 00:24:12.350, Speaker A: Currently on testnet, not on Mainet yet. We sandbox two markets, okay? ETH USDC and BTC USDC. And we create a sequencer just like an L two sequencer, which decide the order and do first come, first serve. And it pays three basis points to the LPs and it pays half a basis point to the validator. So this is on top of the mev auction. Okay, there is an mev auction, but we just sandbox a piece which nobody can touch outside of the sequencer. And let's see how much money this thing pays.
00:24:12.350 - 00:24:43.062, Speaker A: So without this still yet being on Mainet, we're like, okay, who is this valuable for? Well, if we build this and we add liquidity here, users from the get go get 30% discount. Why? Because it's three and a half basis points. Sorry, 30% discount on their fees. So instead of paying five basis point fee, they'll pay three and a half basis point fee. So from the get go, it's better for them. But also, this is real time. So people arbitra will keep correcting the price.
00:24:43.062 - 00:25:00.122, Speaker A: They get the current correct price. They send a transaction to the sequencer. The sequencer say, oh, it got in. Here are the transaction, here are their order. They would know whether the transaction executed or didn't execute. It won't be front run. It's great for users for validators, also great.
00:25:00.122 - 00:25:26.306, Speaker A: Why? Because it's on top of the mev auction. We're sandboxing it. And in addition to any money that they're making in the mev auction, we're trying to show that this pays better. So they'll get more money from this sandbox. They get a sustainable model. So instead of like right now you're seeing it already. Validator used to take all the money and now you say, oh, no, I want to take some of it back.
00:25:26.306 - 00:25:55.178, Speaker A: And protocol try to get and the mev that validators are getting is declining. So it's a sustainable they get we did a simulation around it. They should be getting something like 15% of what uniswap LPs are making right now. Something like $40 million per year. If we add BTC in there, maybe it's $80 million per year. If we make it double the liquidity because it's useful, then maybe it's more. Really should be great for Validators.
00:25:55.178 - 00:26:30.358, Speaker A: Okay, let's ten X DFI for the LPs who are actually Lping for that because there's so much more activity. If you just look at the toxic order flow, the bad trades, you already see that they're making 20% more fees than they would in the ETH USDC five basis point. And again, that is the largest, most active, biggest piece of DFI out there. Nontoxic order flow should be even higher. Skipping for a second just because we're at the end. There are all sorts of weird implications for that. If, again, we need to prove that this pays better.
00:26:30.358 - 00:26:50.814, Speaker A: But if we do this, we don't need PBS. PBS was only designed so validator. Big and small are on the same level. But if you just order transaction, you don't do anything fancy. We don't need PBS. Should this happen? On l one or an L two? Well, this is a lot of volume. Maybe you want it on l Two, but maybe Validators want it on l one.
00:26:50.814 - 00:27:02.462, Speaker A: Maybe users want the decentralization of ethereum. Maybe they want to keep it. I don't know. What about MMEV. Burn. There's a question. And so really reaching to the end of the presentation.
00:27:02.462 - 00:27:22.474, Speaker A: Thank you, everybody for being here. The question is, are you joining me on this? Okay, like we're doing this. I don't care if you join me or not. We're doing it super awesome. And the idea is to make DFI compete with CFI. There's tons of way to participate in this, okay? You could add liquidity if you're working on an L Two and you want to include that in yours. If you're a protocol, whatever.
00:27:22.474 - 00:27:50.700, Speaker A: If you have a cool idea of additional services, whatever. I'm super pumped about it. This is going to I assume it's going to make big waves. Anybody who wants to jam on this and think about cool ways to use it and improve it, or honestly, if you have some ETH or USDC or BTC and say, well, I'm willing to chip in and add some liquidity to jumpstart it, that'd be awesome. Thank you, everybody. Just on time.
