00:00:08.980 - 00:01:00.170, Speaker A: Okay. Hello, welcome everyone. Thank you so much for coming to my talk. My name is Christina and I'm the co founder of Social Stack. Social Stack is a social token platform that is focused on onboarding non web three native communities. On to web three and we are driving cultural change through launching and supporting impact driven communities that catalyze grassroots solutions to solve society's biggest challenges. And one of the biggest challenges we were able to experience now the last couple days in Paris and also in this room currently.
00:01:00.170 - 00:01:40.164, Speaker A: And yeah, this is just one of them. And if we keep going at this rate, this will be the coldest summer we ever experience. And yeah, it's up to us to start taking action and do something about it. I tell you a little bit about myself. So this is the little me always loving nature since young age. But I have spent most of my adult life in big cities. So does 55% of population currently, which is about 4.2
00:01:40.164 - 00:03:24.000, Speaker A: million people. And the estimate is doubling that at 2050, which, yeah, it's a lot of people in big cities, which, at least for me and for a lot of people, created the disconnect between us and nature and between disconnect between us and others. And so I've been focusing on impact. I've been in this blockchain space since about 2016 and I've been a community builder in all sorts of in tech, in sports, you name it. And I have been always asking the question how can we create the most impact possible? And for me personally, I've been connecting a lot of impact companies with impact investors and then being in blockchain and doing community and then somehow, magically, it all combined into one. And it became clear that the answer can be Web Three and the potential of providing support for grassroots roots movements and the ability to be able to tackle them altogether. And about a year and a half ago I came across Social Tokens and I just became really fascinated with this because these are currencies that can be issued by brands, communities and creators where the underlying value of the token is the utility that Insurer creates for the token.
00:03:24.000 - 00:04:22.648, Speaker A: I will get into real examples that we already have after this year and a half of doing social tokens. So we are still very early, even if we've been coming to these events for several years. But this is not the majority of the population even these days going around Paris and just randomly asking people if they heard about crypto. The answer is either no and then I say bitcoin. They're like oh bitcoin, you have bitcoin or you're rich. Okay, so that's kind of the general answer I get from the public still. So about 1% of total population has a crypto wallet right now, which is still very early and the prediction is rapid growth actually.
00:04:22.648 - 00:05:25.980, Speaker A: So we are expecting about 4 billion people being onboarded in the next ten years, which is a lot. And if we're focusing on bringing the culture into the space which, yeah, the majority of people will not be onboarded through investing, they will be onboarded through earning their first crypto. So we've seen this with pay to earn and people earning like this. So we came up with Impact to earn. So doing positive Impact to earn your crypto. And so people will join the space through social communities, not through DeFi social communities that they're already part of. And these, for example, brands or creators will launch a community and they will be automatically onboarded onto these communities.
00:05:25.980 - 00:07:02.670, Speaker A: We've seen this currently in the last years with NFTs. And yeah, the social tokens is basically the next step where everyone will be rewarded. So social tokens are estimated at around 1 trillion in the next five to ten years. This is according to Raul Powell. Paul for real vision. And here we have pie that represents kind of like a common structure of a Dow treasury, which yeah, that's kind of the biggest question when you're starting a Dow, how do you allocate the percentage? And currently we have between 50% to 80% allocated to community treasury, some airdrops to previous people that participated in the project before or we want to get interested into the project team, partners, stakeholders, and then a small sliver to something like liquidity mining or something relevant to your community. So this is where we come into play, this little sliver, which is Impact, where you're able to allocate a percentage of your treasury into Impact where people will be able to earn and redeem your tokens for doing positive actions, for whatever is your Impact mission or whatever you want to support.
00:07:02.670 - 00:08:19.424, Speaker A: Which gives us from this prediction of 1,100,000,000,000 to incentivize grassroots movements, which is not a small number. So just 10% of allocation of your treasury gives us this in the next five years, which is already a significant number. So here we come to Real world Use cases that we've been working with the past year and a half. We have currently 25 communities on the platform such as Makatai Coin, which is a retreat center in Ecuador and offers different retreats. They've been able to raise $150,000 by selling their NFT to their community. Then they will then be able to redeem for future room nights and retreats at the Echo Village. Then we're working with Project Zero, a nonprofit that is supported by many different celebrities to tackle ocean and climate African Tech Roundup, which is an Africa podcast which is focused on education and bringing in the next generation of African entrepreneurs.
00:08:19.424 - 00:08:33.930, Speaker A: And then one of my favorites, actually, as a fellow surfer is the Blue Ticket token from Starboard, which, for the past almost 30 years of being.
00:08:36.780 - 00:08:37.096, Speaker B: On.
00:08:37.118 - 00:09:43.808, Speaker A: The market, starboard's main team, core team, has been focused on cleaning the oceans and planting mangroves and making the boards out of sustainable materials. And they have launched their token a couple of months ago with us, and they have been able to clean 500,000 pounds of plastic out of the oceans. They've done this through beach cleanups that been organized by them where people were able to scan a QR code and then automatically got the Blue ticket token. This is one way of doing it. The other way would be any of you could go to the beach, clean the beach and post a picture of you with the trash that you collected, submit that and then still not fully automated, but an admin could come in and admin could come in and approve the tokens that then will be released for you. So you can do it alone as well. So we are announcing our social token grant fund.
00:09:43.808 - 00:10:49.924, Speaker A: As of today, this has been one of our main challenges where the communities we've been onboarding did not have enough resources to be able to bring a real human to actually go and approve the tasks and to tell the community that this is something they're doing. So we're very excited to announce this grant. You can go to our website as a community and apply or refer any other communities that you know that might be interested. We got this grant from Cello and we're open to other grants from other layer ones if you're interested. So this is the Summer of Action which we launch here in Paris and you can scan this code right here. We have a couple actions you can directly take here in Paris. So one of the actions would be bring your own water bottle and take a picture and post which the idea is then if you do it, it turns into a habit and if you share with others, you inspire others to do so as well.
00:10:49.924 - 00:12:21.080, Speaker A: So that is the idea. And then we of course have some amazing rewards as entry to our party tonight on a rooftop, which is this one right here. So you can do an action and then enter right there in the right corner of all the campaigns you can see the tokens that you can earn for participating in the different campaigns. So for example, you can earn the WeCare Token and Sello token and then for Buy by Plastic which is Buy by Plastic Foundation, who Blondish, the DJ, started the organization and they are working to get rid of single use plastic in the music industry and beyond. They have around 1500 DJs that are part of the organization and they have not yet launched their tokens. So that's why you can only earn Cello token and this can be used also for larger brands that we're talking to, which you know how it goes with large brands that it takes longer for them to be able to launch a token. So this is kind of a way for them to be able to sort of sponsor an activation as well which gives them optics and going closer towards their ESG goals.
00:12:21.080 - 00:13:23.464, Speaker A: So these are the different campaigns. You can see them yourself when you log into the platform, so it will bring your own water battle to the event. Clean up Paris, which you can pick up a piece of plastic on the street and post Dead, or you sign up for their pre launch. These are some of the other activations that you can take here in Paris. So you can with Project Zero, you can take the climate pledge, or you can adopt a piece of Ocean coordinate and then you can win a ticket to Big Splash in Ibiza, where it's a charity swim, where they bring a lot of their celebrities and models that are partnering with the organization. And whoa, so hot here. And then with WeCare, you can win the ticket to our party tonight if you post about carbon offsetting.
00:13:23.464 - 00:14:04.504, Speaker A: So you can just go onto Twitter or Instagram and post either a picture or anything you would like to say about carbon offsetting. What's your experience? What do you think about it? And then submit that just like I did. So I submitted, I posted about carbon offset and now I'm going to the party. This is the party tonight. I hope to see you there. And this is something I would like to leave you with. There are big climate change and all that.
00:14:04.504 - 00:14:44.260, Speaker A: It's a big word. It's something like if you're working, you divide your big task into smaller tasks. And the same is what we do with things like climate change or other problems we're facing in the world. And, yeah, Web Three technology and social tokens are something that can help us achieve it. And people can be rewarded for taking these smaller actions. And if we add up the numbers and a larger amount of people will take these actions, then we're on a good track. So, yeah, together we can change the world with a little help of social tokens.
00:14:44.260 - 00:14:55.290, Speaker A: Thank you. Any questions?
00:14:56.860 - 00:14:59.224, Speaker B: Yes, there's been a lot of studies.
00:14:59.272 - 00:15:00.830, Speaker A: That when you pay people.
00:15:03.440 - 00:15:46.412, Speaker B: There have been a lot of studies that show that as soon as you pay people to do positive impacts, they stop doing it and they compare it to like, a job. It becomes a task. And when I logged in online, it gave me like one paragraph that I'm supposed to read about carbon credits, which I know a lot about. And then I'm supposed to tweet it to my followers, which is like kind of an information pollution that I'm supposed to do and dirty up my stack where I'm not an expert on carbon credits. So I'm going to give some pithy thing. It just seems so meaningless and it's not worth it for me, especially a Western person. If I want to clean up the beach and spend a day, you can't compensate for me for my time.
00:15:46.412 - 00:16:11.684, Speaker B: So it just seems like this feels good, but it's not really moving in the right direction of having people do things because they're paid and doing things that are meaningful for them. To me, you're asking me to pollute my information feed instead of asking me to do good, so it just doesn't feel right to me.
00:16:11.802 - 00:16:56.448, Speaker A: Yeah, I do understand that. And if you have any better ideas, I'm happy to talk as well. This is the idea of basically optics, right? So you know what I mean? But I'm happy to chat after if you have any other ideas. We're also putting together this Impact Leaders Consortium or whatever I call it, and they will help us to create other Impact tasks. So, yeah, I'm happy to talk to after. Thanks. Any other questions? Cool.
00:16:56.448 - 00:16:59.310, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Thank.
