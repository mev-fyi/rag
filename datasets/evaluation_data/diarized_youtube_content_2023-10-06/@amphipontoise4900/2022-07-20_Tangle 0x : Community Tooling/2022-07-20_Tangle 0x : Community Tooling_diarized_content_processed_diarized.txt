00:06:31.180 - 00:06:59.396, Speaker A: Website to have a captcha that is that is solved outside of Discord and provides a one time use link. This way here you avoid scammers actually getting into your Discord ahead of time. And then if you just have a random link that they can join, that's an infinite invite. They can join your discord. You may have like to pass capture once you're inside, but they have your entire member list and can immediately start spam. Bring everybody that is in your list and they already have that. They know that they're a part of that server, therefore it can be an attack vector.
00:06:59.396 - 00:07:29.152, Speaker A: So I really like this and I don't prefer these other options which a lot of people want to use, which are really convenient. This thing takes a bit to set up. But I've also got links to this. This one's by Mirand daniel really like what this is doing. So, in other words, other places you can just use like a custom Discord vanity link. So that's great to have that just to identify your branding and everything. And then what you'll want to do is use the captcha bot, of course.
00:07:29.152 - 00:08:07.420, Speaker A: So the Captcha bot does have some downfalls just because it's in kind of like a non setup. So if you haven't completed a captcha from before, if somebody else comes to claim yours and actually have the captcha come through, it'll still wait for the other one to get completed. So you either have to clear it out or it's really annoying, that setup. So I have a few quorums with that. Yeah, then it's just simple things too, with just like having role selection. So if you just want something low, if it's a pretty low chill server, just have like a role reaction bot that can set up roles. So when people come in, at least you know that they're human and they're not just bots.
00:08:07.420 - 00:08:27.808, Speaker A: Other tools to help your community safe anti spam bot. Love. This one from Daniel. It just runs in the background. I'm using it across Sushi, layer zero and Stargate. It runs across 600 different servers. 60 different servers are protected by it, and there's over a million users in the database.
00:08:27.808 - 00:09:04.448, Speaker A: So this is keeping track of anybody that is scammers. If they get banned on one of them, they get banned across everything. So it's a really wicked tool that's running in the background. Of course, a ticketing bot. This is something that I brought in with stargate and layer zero and really liked how when you have somebody has a question, you have them go directly to a ticketing channel where they have direct contact with either your moderators or your team so that they know that they are getting direct support and that it's not just DMs or it's not just like wide open in a channel, because a lot of people will end up again. Scam vector. So I'm really tight on security.
00:09:04.448 - 00:09:24.640, Speaker A: I really want this to. This is where a lot of this is coming from. And even auto messaging bots. Just something as simple as with security. Best practices. How many people here have seen people give up their seed phrase just randomly giving this out? I hope nobody in here has done that. But so many people in the early days of this were just like giving up their seed phrase.
00:09:24.640 - 00:09:49.464, Speaker A: Even an auto message bot, they can just be repeating that, repeating that, repeating that. Don't give it up, don't give it up. That might be enough just to prevent that person to be like, hey, wait a second, I shouldn't do that. So I like all those things to help with security. So growth and fostering. So now we're going to look at a bunch of places to get bots. So Top GG is a fantastic place for all of these tools for bots and whatnot.
00:09:49.464 - 00:10:28.220, Speaker A: So me Six and the YAG bot, those are really big popular multipurpose bots. I don't use them a whole lot personally because I'm trying to find specific use cases for bots that do exactly what I want. But these are really great for just generic things, generic commands to have your community engage with. Sesh FYI fantastic as well. For calendar reminders, it can remind you like on the daily, hourly, the ten minutes before and at the event and you can even tie it into your Google Calendar. So that's a really cool tool. And then translation bot for someone like myself that's only speaking one language natively.
00:10:28.220 - 00:11:13.016, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really helpful tool if I'm going to go into a different channel, different language channel, and want to be able to see what's going on. Tweet Shift fantastic to bring in all of your tweets so people can actually see what's happening on your Twitter feed and get alerts about it so that they can go and engage there so you can take them to Twitter as well. Web Three data Info Bots Also cool to have that up in your right hand corner of your discord where you have like your member list. You can actually have those bots up there that are displaying that kind of information. So things like your gas prices or the price of your token or how much volume you've had, things like this that you can bring in. Really cool because now I'm not like leaving. I don't have to go to block native or have to go somewhere else.
00:11:13.016 - 00:11:57.608, Speaker A: I can just be in our discord and know, oh, hey, it's gas is cheap. I'm going to make some transactions. And then the last one here is just like member list bots where you can pick up all of your members that are within your list and perhaps use that in conjunction with some of the things up next year. So identifying your engaged and invested members. Collab Land Guild, Noble, all really great tools to connect web two to web three. So you can now see what each of your members has in their wallet when they connect with it. So if you wanted to have token gated certain channels or certain communities or whatever you needed, this way here, you can say, does this person have this amount of tokens in their wallet? Or hold this NFT or something like that.
00:11:57.608 - 00:13:02.220, Speaker A: That way you can build role based things for them and be able to grow your community that way and know who is an actual holder or an actual believer and has conviction. And then again, I touched on this earlier with the Sushi Samurai, but like finding engaged community champions and empowering them, the Sushi Samurai was a really great it's almost a case study, I feel at this point, with watching community members grow into actual team members and are essentially protecting the Sushi community. So really like what's happened there with them and absolutely love them. So if you're ever in the Sushi server and you got a problem, you're looking for a Samurai, even just reach out to them in general. Yeah, forums and engagement tools. A lot of you are probably familiar with discourse that's one of the oldest ones. A lot of diversity allowed with that one, and a lot of different ways to engage with it, with different trust levels and whatnot.
00:13:02.220 - 00:13:22.364, Speaker A: It's worked really well. But I really like Commonwealth, to be honest. It's a new one here. It's up and coming. It has web three login, so immediately you're logging in with your web wallet. That was like the first thing that attracted me to it. Of course you can have token gating, so now you know that, hey, someone that is actually a part of your protocol, they have tokens.
00:13:22.364 - 00:13:58.044, Speaker A: You can actually set that up to have those topics token gated so you don't just have spam messages. And then of course, the cool thing with this is that it can actually tie the Snapshot proposals back to the actual topic or the proposal that was created in Commonwealth. So now you can vote directly on Commonwealth in Snapshot. So it's connecting all this stuff. Really like that tool. And it seems to be working well with hardware wallets as well. Snapshot is, of course, the voting platform that many dows are using and multi chain strategies is really great.
00:13:58.044 - 00:14:55.276, Speaker A: So you can have it just across different networks and the ability to tie it back to your forum, wherever it was before, wherever your forum was, you'll be able to tie that back to that original post. And then, of course, the end thing here is the I voted PO app. I really like how if you voted, I really want to see engagement in and I really appreciate the engagement behind voting. So the Ivoted POAP thing has been super cool, which ties us into our next thing here with POAP, the proof of attendance protocol. Absolutely love what POAP has done, and it's been a huge engagement tool for us, for me and for all the communities I've been involved in. So if you've been to any one of my events in the past, it's chances are you've heard me speak about the Dgen bot that has been keeping track of you after 15 minutes. And then this is a tool that will actually deliver the PO app to you after you send it, or either go claim it in a channel or can send it to you directly.
00:14:55.276 - 00:15:28.356, Speaker A: So shout out to the bankless guys that have been working on that and have kept that going. Yeah, the POAP delivery great for just like on chain actions that you've completed and being able to receive a POAP for that. And then raffles is really cool too. If you've got a whole bunch of people within your community then you just want to give out a few things. Really cool to have a raffle based on the POAP that they hold in their wallet and Poop art. This is like one of my favorite engaging things that I've done was to host this party. Actually we held a couple of them with Sushi.
00:15:28.356 - 00:16:09.544, Speaker A: This one was for last year for the birthday of Sushi and it's allowing you to paint one pixel per second depending on how many PO apps you have. So yeah, we had a ton of engagement with this as well because it's bringing in other communities. You can see so many different projects involved in here and other names of things. So it was really cool to bring so many different communities together and you can even use some of their PO apps to provide access to this as well. And finally, just POAP polls if you needed polls that were based on certain Poaps because people send it in a certain event this way here you could gate it to specific people. So media and content. Dwork is another web.
00:16:09.544 - 00:16:53.300, Speaker A: Three. Basically Trello or Kanban board, I guess I should say great because it ties in with Discord and I really like this aspect of it too because when a new task is created, it'll actually prompt you over in Discord so you know that it's coming in direct web wallet. Payout is a wicked feature as well because you can pay on any network in basically any token. Well, several of the networks I was actually quite impressed with how many have been supported and pay out in any token because you may want to be using your token as compared to just a random token or sorry, a more generic token. So big fan of them notion, a lot of people are familiar with that. More Web two, a lot of teams using It companies, protocols, it's great. But I kind of like this.
00:16:53.300 - 00:17:28.720, Speaker A: Of course coming back to anything that's web Three and of course Trello. Easy for Kanban boards, shareable, things like that. And finally here with the Discord channels stages. Again, this is one thing that I'm using regularly. Absolutely love stages. It's great for hosting events with having your guests be able to come up on stage and it leaves the audience muted, essentially, so they have to request to come up so you don't end up with hot mics and things like this where it becomes kind of a disruption for your event. Again, this is great because the threshold on it as well.
00:17:28.720 - 00:17:51.764, Speaker A: You can have so many people in here as compared to like a voice channel where voice channels limited to like 100. They're good for quick chats and you can screen share with it, but the audience isn't muted by default. So you have to preset that up ahead of time. So it just takes a little more configuration to do that. But I really like the appearance of the stages and that's what I use for the most part. Radio music channels. We've also got, like, the lo fi bot.
00:17:51.764 - 00:18:31.460, Speaker A: So if any of you have been to my events before, you may have heard the Lo Fi Bot playing ahead of time and afterwards. But I do like having a channel where you can just come in and chill and listen to tunes such as the Lo Fi Bot or bring in any kind of YouTube channel. Now for actually working on your content and bringing your content in. So online broadcast software OBS, that's a great way to record and live stream through this. So you're able to tie it in with YouTube, Twitch and then Restream. And the Restream is the key part here where things can get really interesting. So basically you can build out your whole scene of what you want to look like on when you're sending it to YouTube or to Twitch.
00:18:31.460 - 00:18:58.908, Speaker A: And then of course, having a mic and mixer. Just get yourself an XLR mic. Just do it. Get a good one that has phantom power. And get this RODECaster pro. I don't mean to shill anything like this, but since I got this thing, this has unlocked a ton of basically this next part that I'm going to be chatting about, the RODECaster Pro has unlocked it because of its Bluetooth features. And Nvidia Broadcast is great for it is only for PC because it requires that Nvidia graphics card.
00:18:58.908 - 00:19:37.016, Speaker A: But the noise removal is unbelievable, absolutely insane. So you really want to use that one. So finally here as we talk about the ultimate event aggregator and this is something I finally put together, I've been wanting to do this for ages, where you're able to host an event in Discord, host an event in Twitter spaces. Those two are able to communicate with each other. Then you can have this in OBS, the online broadcasting software. Build your scene in there where you're pulling in Discord, pulling in Twitter so you can have the audiences of both of those. And then you're live streaming to both YouTube and Twitch right through the use of Restream.
00:19:37.016 - 00:20:25.512, Speaker A: Now with Restream you can also have the chat aggregation as well. So it's supporting Discord, Twitch, and YouTube. So basically you no longer have to think, oh, where should I have my audience? Personally, I like to host things in Discord, and that's where I make my, I guess, main presence. But now you can actually reach every single audience on any of these platforms, and they don't have to be opting into having to jump over to one or the other. I particularly don't like Twitter spaces, and I hope that they hear this and that they get a better system for their desktop, for your desktop app. But this way here, we're able to bring this all together. And the key thing here is using OBS and that RODECaster Pro mixer because it has Bluetooth and it allows you to connect to your phone, and then you're able to speak through that.
00:20:25.512 - 00:20:55.620, Speaker A: So I've got a whole documentation on all of that which you can find afterwards here from my link tree. But in conclusion, communities are growing. They're not going anywhere. I'm seeing a massive amount of growth with this. The tools are improving constantly. It's incredible to see how many Web Three and Dow Toolings are coming out. So I'm really excited for the future here as we just continue to build out our communities, basically.
00:20:55.620 - 00:21:35.290, Speaker A: Thank you all so much for listening to this talk there. Scan my link tree if you want. Right now you can actually connect with all of my socials, and I've got this whole community tooling page here as well for all of the resources if you want to check out on anything that we've talked about and more. So anyways, thank you all very much. Questions? Sorry. Right. If anybody wants a PO app afterwards, stick around and you can get one from me.
00:21:35.290 - 00:21:43.050, Speaker A: So is there a question if no questions, no big deal. All right, go ahead.
00:21:45.980 - 00:21:51.300, Speaker B: Do you do some quest inside your Discord social quest?
00:21:51.390 - 00:22:03.090, Speaker A: I haven't really got to quest yet, but I know that there's some great tooling for that as well. I guess like rabbit hole or there was another new one here recently I started looking into. But are you guys with some quest stuff?
00:22:03.780 - 00:22:18.340, Speaker B: Yeah, quest stuff, sure. And other question. There's like a lot of similar Discord copy like tool for Web Three. What do you think of creating more Web Three native stuff? Do you think would love it.
00:22:18.490 - 00:22:35.610, Speaker A: Yeah. Whoever decides to build the Web Three Discord, I'm fully on board, so please reach out to me. I absolutely want that. Discord works great. Would love to see that in Web Three because that's what this is all about.
00:22:40.650 - 00:22:41.814, Speaker B: Okay, thank you.
00:22:41.932 - 00:22:54.780, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks everyone. You, um cool. Thanks for the call. Very interesting one.
