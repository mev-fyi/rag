But maybe you're not the best designer or artist. Maybe you don't know how to turn your vision into a compelling UX or a mobile experience or a desktop experience. Go out and find yourself a great designer or who you can pair with that can translate your vision into a user experience. Put another way, think about where you're weak or where you can be amplified. Find people who can do that well, and that should form the shape of your product team. It's not a one size fits all process.
