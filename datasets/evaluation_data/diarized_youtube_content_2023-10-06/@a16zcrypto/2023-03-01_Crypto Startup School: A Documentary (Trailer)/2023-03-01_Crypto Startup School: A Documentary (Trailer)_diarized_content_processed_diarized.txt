00:00:05.170 - 00:00:13.230, Speaker A: What really kicked us off to crypto is that we need to figure out a way for the community to own their data. It's a different mentality. It's like global mentality.

00:00:57.090 - 00:01:11.700, Speaker B: I came to California for this program without really knowing many people. Going out and telling the world about this dream that you have, and then getting pretty consistently shot down. You have to be pretty tough for that.
00:01:12.070 - 00:01:30.100, Speaker C: It took a little convincing for me to tell my wife that I would leave my very comfortable corporate job to come pursue a startup with a guy I just met.
