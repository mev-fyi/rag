00:00:10.490 - 00:00:53.920, Speaker A: So Greg and I have had the opportunity to work together for about the last six months or so. Right as I was joining a 16 Z, I got to meet Greg and his co founder Wiley and do a little bit of work together. And the first time that I met Greg, I was honestly a little bit starstruck. I mean, I'm meeting one of the two geniuses behind board Ape Yacht Club and I was trying to think of, okay, like, how can I introduce myself in a way where I'm not going to look like an idiot? And so I'm like, so nice to meet you. Tell me about what kind of stuff did you work on before you guys did BYC and do you remember what you said?
00:00:55.650 - 00:00:56.960, Speaker B: You can tell the story.
00:00:57.490 - 00:01:21.638, Speaker A: So we're outside shooting baskets and Greg turns me and looks at me deadpan and he goes, I was the editor of an adult Harry Potter coloring book. And so maybe you can talk about how you went from that to creating what I think everyone would agree is like the biggest original IP company in the space.
00:01:21.804 - 00:01:35.690, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. Thank you for that very kind introduction. Exactly. Two geniuses. More like two idiots. I was a book editor.
00:01:35.690 - 00:02:29.482, Speaker B: That was like the only career I had before starting yugo. With Wiley and my other two budies, KREM and Zishan. And it came out of the fact that I grew up just wanting to be a writer. I decided that's what I wanted to do when I was twelve years old and kind of like mapped out the rest of my life at that moment, as if that was the plan. Because what I really liked was just the idea of owning something from start to finish and just doing it on your own. It felt like rather than working in a big company or doing something like that, that a writer gets to just do something on their own and craft it over years and put it out into the world. And so I went to NYU because that seemed like a good writerly school to go to.
00:02:29.482 - 00:02:49.794, Speaker B: And I got an MFA in poetry at the University of Know, which was an amazing experience. Best two years of my life, by far. Just getting paid to just a stipend graduate, stipend to sit around and write poems all day and then couldn't get a job right after that, of course.
00:02:49.832 - 00:02:52.046, Speaker A: Because I went to school for because you're a writer.
00:02:52.078 - 00:03:44.194, Speaker B: Yeah. But lo and behold, then I got a job as a book editor, first out of vintage Espanol, working on all kinds of Latin American books, and then I fell into licensed publishing. So it was working on big coffee table books and learning, helping video game publishers tell stories of how they created content and that kind of thing. But hilariously. Yes, I went to school for poetry, and in particular read a lot in translation and wrote a lot in Spanish too. But the most successful thing I'd done was the Harry Potter adult coloring book. It's a very funny thing to go to school for poetry and do that, but it sold like a crazy amount.
00:03:44.232 - 00:04:02.538, Speaker A: Of copies to and talk about maybe. So from there. When you think about BYC, was there like a single inception moment or was this one of 50 concepts that you guys thought about and workshopped and ultimately arrived at this one?
00:04:02.624 - 00:05:02.682, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a long process and I think COVID was a big part of it. I just gotten a COVID pay cut, as I think a lot of us did around that time. So even though some of these books were selling for millions and millions of copies, not quite that many a million copies, book publishing, like everything else, was taking a hit in early COVID and it left us with a lot of time at home thinking through things. And I remember it was early 2021. Bitcoin and Ethereum had been the talk of the town again. And Know saw a project taking over Crypto, twitter called Hashmath. And it was the end of January, early February.
00:05:02.682 - 00:05:48.026, Speaker B: And I texted Wiley because it felt so exciting, because it felt like a moment where, oh, here's a non technical project for the first time. That's like center stage in crypto. It says, like, from a technical perspective, there's actually nothing that interesting about this. This is actually just content publishing, making use of the blockchain, but meeting it where it is. It's not like Uber for crypto or whatever. It's like, oh no, how does owning a thing as simple as a JPEG change when you introduce the ownership that we have, like decentralized ownership on the blockchain? And that was exciting. And we started to think about any idea that we could have.
00:05:48.026 - 00:06:11.006, Speaker B: And I think the very first thing I was going back recently found an old text with Wiley where I said we should make something. And the first thing we were drawn to actually was out of copyright, like public domain stuff like, oh, is there something with HP. Lovecraft or something like winning the pooh.
00:06:11.038 - 00:06:11.186, Speaker A: Right?
00:06:11.208 - 00:07:11.640, Speaker B: You could have done yeah, like whatever, I don't guess could have waited two years and done Mickey Mouse now, or something like that. And then we had some very dumb ideas, to be honest. And it was only after it was actually like a month and a half later that we landed on the idea of what we would eventually do. And that was born out of trying to evolve the idea past. Like, oh, this isn't an art collection. This is how do we make something that's like a membership, like a token? It's like a club, but also not taking ourselves too seriously and trying to do something that felt authentic to felt a little authentic and cheeky to the space. It was time of Wall Street bets and everybody was talking about aping into stocks or crypto or something like that.
00:07:11.640 - 00:07:28.458, Speaker B: And so we came up with the idea for Board Apes out of that, but also trying to make fun of the whole like we're all going to be rich and go to the moon and own Lamborghinis and came with the idea. Well, what if the board of Yacht Club is like a derelict swamp in the Everglades and it's crappy and punk rock and all?
00:07:28.624 - 00:07:50.002, Speaker A: And you've said in other conversations that at the time you were super worried that you were too late to the party and talk about what was driving that feeling and why that turned out to be. Actually, it turned out that your timing could not have been better. What do you think were the factors that went into that?
00:07:50.136 - 00:08:45.426, Speaker B: Yeah, so in February, late January, early February, hashmas sold out, like seemingly instantaneously in a week for $16 million or something. And then all of a sudden, a dozen other projects sprouted up, half of which I can't remember the names of now. There was one on Yfusion was one, and there was one called Chubbies that got in trouble because it turned out their art was stolen from somewhere. But then the space just went, like, seemingly went quiet. There was a lot of projects that were trying to mint out that would mint, like, 300 units of a ten K collection and then hit flat. And so we just thought, we're done for. This is it.
00:08:45.426 - 00:09:49.126, Speaker B: We spent three months, which doesn't sound like a long time, but when you're doing it 12 hours a day next to your day job, it feels like a bigger commitment than it does. In retrospect, we felt like yeah, I think we felt like the window had closed because it had for if we were doing the exact same thing, if we were doing a version of Hash Mass, then of course there wouldn't be room. But that led us to think about how do we do anything possible to land on something that is distinct in some way? And so we came up with everything from doing, like, a treasure hunt on the very first day. That was like, how we opened. It was like an opening presale where we were giving away One ETH and a Board Ape to somebody who could solve these three puzles. And every person in our discord didn't care about minting Board Apes at all. They wanted to win.
00:09:49.126 - 00:10:02.780, Speaker B: The One ETH, including some of our most long term members, originally came for that express purpose, because we basically said, we will bribe you with $2,000 to be here.
00:10:03.230 - 00:10:05.594, Speaker A: Come for the contest, stay for the NFT.
00:10:05.722 - 00:10:48.106, Speaker B: Yeah. And the NFT was worth $200. The ETH was worth 1400 or whatever it was at the time. And we also just started to realize, what else can we fix? If everything's doing the same thing that everyone else is doing isn't working, then how do we flip it on its head. And so instead of doing these kind of bonding curve sellouts where people would say the first 300 NFTs are a certain price, the next are more expensive, and on you go. We said, everything costs $200. We thought it would be interesting if you own the JPEG, then you actually could own the IP to this thing in a certain way.
00:10:48.106 - 00:11:39.606, Speaker B: So we threw that in too. And what would this location look like? It's not just 10,000 apes. How can we create this world and this little bit of a story around it? Let's add that as well. Can we make special ones and tweet them out at influencers? Let's do that too. We just basically went down the list every single day of what else can we do, given the fact that we don't think this is going to go anywhere. And also, I think part of it was when we landed on board Ape Yacht Club. It was just such an absurd, silly name and idea that I just remember walking around the neighborhood thinking, like, yeah, if this goes nowhere, at least it's a pretty funny story that we tried to make a club in the swamp for apes on the Internet, and that's how we spend our summer.
00:11:39.798 - 00:12:44.740, Speaker A: That's awesome. I don't think I've told you the story before, but I remember talking to Alex and Devin, the two openc co founders, this was probably August of 2021. And I asked them, I'm like, okay, how do you tell the difference between a high quality NFT project and a run of the mill project? And they said that they're like, well, with BYC, all you had to do was look at the discord, and you could just tell there was a level of creativity and energy and engagement that you hadn't seen anywhere else at that time. And I think that if you look at, everything looks super organized and like it was all destined to be in hindsight. But at the time you guys after BYC, you did mutant, it yacht club, board ape Kennel club. More recently, you did the trials of Jimmy the monkey. You've had this, I'd say, succession of just incredibly creative innovations in the process.
00:12:44.740 - 00:13:00.434, Speaker A: Talk a little bit about how first as a small team and now as a relatively large company, how do you keep that creative juice flowing and to just kind of continue to delight your community again and again?
00:13:00.552 - 00:13:59.740, Speaker B: Yeah. Starting at the first thing you said, I think the discord is so important, I think for all of crypto like twitter and discord and certainly any business or project that's trying to be community focused, 80% of the work in those few months that happened in discord and not externally. And I think that's weird to say. Crypto is a little like anarchic, obviously, and libertarian and people don't like rules or anything like that. And managing a discord, finding a way to build a community in that kind of space Is tricky. And the only way we did It Was we were there in it 14 hours a day. 16 hours a day, talking to people, joking around with them, trying to set, Like, A fun tone, hearing about What Other People Were Trying To build, participating in that Fielding DMs about Any number of things.
00:13:59.740 - 00:15:38.426, Speaker B: And I think That's Been A Huge Blessing For us, is that that community that Was born out of Discord in those earliest months, so some of Our Best employees, our absolute Best employees, most important people, came straight out of there. Because when we're talking in crypto, the economies of scale here are so small. It's like some of the data Is like, yuga is like 70% of the top ten NFT collection Volume of all time, yet Our holders is lifetime, like 60,000 or something like that. That's not that big, that you can't know a lot of them and just meet them and be there for Them. I think discord was a huge part of it. And in terms of the creative energy, I think Wyatt and I were both writers and we had certain ideas of, like, how do we do something that we feel like is very high effort that there's? Like, you know, you could just go to the BYC website and it felt like there was just more there than there was on other places and more like love of detail and that kind of stuff, but is not taking itself too seriously because that's like the death knell, I think. And how do you communicate to Your community in a way that's authentic, but not like, I don't know, you can never pat yourself on the back.
00:15:38.426 - 00:16:02.982, Speaker B: And we started from nothing, and there's never been one stupid rocket Ship emoji ever or anything like that. Because if you're authentic and plain Faced In that way, I think it's infinitely better than these momentary blips of trying to create hype and all that, which just accelerates the downtrend.
00:16:03.066 - 00:16:16.820, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the job that you guys have done of staying, I think true and authentic to the original organic vibe of the community with everything that you've put out has been pretty amazing.
00:16:17.590 - 00:17:00.130, Speaker B: Thank you. So you mentioned, like, board ape kennel club. That Was a special one because that Was A month Into The project, and it Was Just Like, how do we do something surprising and have fun and reward people? Nobody had gifted away 10,000 NFTs to somebody, to a community that already had an NFT before, and we had no Idea How It Would Work if these things would have any perceived interest or value ascribed to them. And the idea Just Came straight Out Of know, I didn't have a dog. I wanted a dog. My wife didn't Want to get a dog. She still doesn't really want to get a dog.
00:17:00.130 - 00:17:55.378, Speaker B: She knows I work too much to take care of the dog. What if we gave everybody an imaginary NFT. And what if we did it for free? And what if we did to really underscore that this was just like a fun moment and just about creating community and engagement, we decided to donate all the royalties associated with it to animal charities. It was like a month in, we'd done a $2 million mint, and then we ended up raising a million dollars for animal charities right after that. Yeah, that was like, huge. There's still to this day a nonprofit called Orangutan Outreach that does a ton for orangutans in Borneo. And they bought a board, Ape, soon after that because we donated a bunch of money to them and the founder wanted to be part of this thing and support it.
00:17:55.378 - 00:18:02.614, Speaker B: And then they ended up making even more because appreciation of their Ape $600 or whatever.
00:18:02.652 - 00:18:26.000, Speaker A: That's amazing. Anyway, cool. Let's talk about so we've talked about some of the good times. I think you guys, like everybody in the space, have faced probably more than your fair share of like, oh, shit moments. Talk about one that really sticks out in your mind. What was it? How did you navigate through it and what did you learn from it?
00:18:26.370 - 00:19:20.334, Speaker B: Yeah, it's difficult to just find one. But I will say that Wiley and I would talk to each other a lot about how our job as founders we felt like was to eat shit sandwiches. Was like, oh, this is a very painful thing that I do not want to do. But it's best for the company or the community if I do it. So that's what we're going to do. And that a lot of our job as co founders was keeping each other honest to do that. And I think the times that we've been able to be true to that spirit and also push ourselves to do it authentically, how do you throw your arms around a thing rather than kind of get timid about it? That's been good.
00:19:20.334 - 00:19:40.086, Speaker B: And where we've fallen apart is only when the ones that keep you up in Editor, it's like, oh, you took somebody else's advice on the idea. If it was your own screw up, you can fall asleep. But if you did something because a PR person told you or something like.
00:19:40.108 - 00:19:44.182, Speaker A: That, it's like you did it against.
00:19:44.236 - 00:19:45.282, Speaker B: Your own better judgment.
00:19:45.346 - 00:20:04.880, Speaker A: Yeah, we've talked a little bit about where you guys came from and the tremendous success to date, but I think that what you've done so far is only a sliver of what your ambitions are going forward. So talk about what you're building with other side and what you think that could.
00:20:07.090 - 00:21:27.714, Speaker B: I mean, we're in this transition period moment where the things that Yuga is historically extremely good at is, like, content, creative, and community. We have a very like, our engineering team crushes it and delivers things very fast and is amazing. But that hasn't historically been like what we're known for or anything like that and yet now we're doing things, doing more and more in gaming. We did Dookie Dash a couple of months ago and we did Other Side second Trip which was 7000 concurrent users in one space. So kind of exceeds the monthly active users for a lot of metaverses in just like the 2 hours that we were getting people in there altogether, which was special. And I think what I think about a lot now is like how do we build these very complex, ambitious things but in a way where we're doing it in public and doing it actively and constantly showing pieces of it. Like the whole crawl walk run is like the motto where with Dookie Dash, for example, crawlwalk run and kind of managing expectations.
00:21:27.714 - 00:21:39.420, Speaker B: So Dookie Dash was a game, it's a simple game, it's an endless runner game. You had to kind of ride a jet ski through the sewers and dodge things and collect stuff.
00:21:39.950 - 00:21:42.830, Speaker A: Super well executed version of that.
00:21:42.900 - 00:22:58.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's the sweet spot is like how can you do something that's fun and feels like a well executed version of a thing rather than trying to do something, setting the bar too high and not being able to manage expectations and failing. And so I think Dookie Dash was amazing as what we wanted it to be, which is a skill based mint. It was a moment for people to kind of hey, compete in essentially this global arcade game to achieve what NFT you're going to use for the next activation. And similarly for other side, we think a lot about like, okay, how do we build alongside the community and have these building blocks of these moments where we can open things up and do special things and then improve on that and do it again in two months and in two months and have something more and more active? And I think I'm excited about Other Side because we're really at the point now where we have several different teams internally and around the world, each building different parts of the game consistently. I can be in Zoom meetings now and have Other Side on my second screen and just be like jumping around, flying around, messing with stuff.
00:22:59.690 - 00:23:19.820, Speaker A: And when you dream big about what it could you what role do you see it playing for Yuga in crypto in general, how would you think about it in comparison to some more traditional things like Fortnite or other large immersive worlds? Where does it fit in your.
00:23:21.710 - 00:24:29.150, Speaker B: So? Discord and Twitter are incredibly important. I would love for people to want to engage with each other more deeply in Other Side. I also want it to be like a meta layer that sits above NFT communities for people to come together. And I want Pudgy penguins or whoever to be able to build a space for themselves there without my permission, without in the true crypto permissionless nature that can engage their community in the best way and then for them to be able to derive value from that. And so whereas Meta or somebody else might want to take 30, 40, 50% of something, how can you keep the margins extremely low, keep it permissionless and have it be like web three enabled those open rails in that way so that you can just be the best option for creators. Fortnite is amazing. The Fortnite creative mode is bonkers.
00:24:29.150 - 00:25:37.222, Speaker B: It's so cool. That said, you think about things like YouTube creators, it's hard as there's a lot of people who can make hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars on YouTube as content creators. But if you talk to those people they're deeply unhappy with YouTube and scared and they feel like they've built their business on like a powder keg and there's rare it seems like somebody who's able to take a million dollar business built on YouTube and make it a billion dollar business. That doesn't happen. Whereas I think with other side part of the vision is how can we make it so that somebody can build a business that can scale past what a web two business can enable because it's built on these open rails and interoperable in these ways. So there's a lot of devil in the details for all that stuff. But that's part of the North Star is what we're that's guiding and actually.
00:25:37.276 - 00:26:05.714, Speaker A: As you guys have marched down this path you've had to really recruit a set of talent. I mean like most recently Mike Siever is your new CTO who was CTO of Epic most recently or Riot. How have you done that while still keeping the culture intact that sort of made you guys what you are today?
00:26:05.912 - 00:27:11.238, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a couple of different ways that we think about culture and it's hard because the tricks you used for the last jump in size of company don't work for the next one. And so we keep leveling up how we do these things. At first it's like okay, we're going to have more frugal in all hands and all that but at a certain point we've hired seven people in the past two weeks and I've met two of them so far. It's hard to keep up with this stuff and so some of the things that we've been able to do though is number one, it comes down to the kinds of leaders that we bring in. It's like people that understand what they know and what they don't know. It's like the worst thing that you can have is somebody that's very confident in what they think web three is when they haven't been kicked in the head in a discord 10,000 times. I think that's a big part of it.
00:27:11.238 - 00:28:11.340, Speaker B: And also making sure that some of the people that are most that came out of the community that they're part of the company now, that those people are continually elevated and working side by side and kind of onboarding people. Like, for example yeah. Daniel Allegri, our CEO. He came from Google and from Activision Blizzard. Extremely entrepreneurial within some of these bigger companies than starting Google China or working on payments or starting Google Latin America or all these different things, but obviously does not have the same Web Three experience as most of the people on the team. But his ability to kind of synthesize and learn from other people has been integral. And at the same time, I think that's where the early people that we brought into the company have been most important.
00:28:11.340 - 00:29:01.014, Speaker B: And the ones I'm most proud of are the ones that just were like anonymous people in discord that were giving their lives to this community as mods or just first as people in the discord just helping out and then as paid mods and then eventually part of the mothership. And I'm just immensely grateful to that cohort and I feel like they're the ones that really carry the culture for everybody else. And I think the worst thing that could have happened, though, is if those people stayed, those people have now, like, you got to kind of tear them away from Discord and from the community sometimes and say, no, actually, you're going to go be head of this thing over here and that's important.
00:29:01.132 - 00:29:05.706, Speaker A: And you always want to go back to your comfort zone in times of stress, right?
00:29:05.808 - 00:29:55.558, Speaker B: Yeah. Or just like, they love it, that's what they want to be part of that. But at the same time they're infinitely valuable, I think, in helping carry the culture. And also the other thing I think we've done, what's been important from day one is we really feel like good ideas can come from anywhere and testing things and I'm very obnoxious around polling everybody on red or blue, red or blue kind of thing. And it can kind of be funny if you hire like a hotshot creative director from an agency or something like that, that wants to be like creative director with capital C and capital D and you're like, no, I want to know what Peepee Man has to say about this orange or whatever. Sometimes they can be touched.
00:29:55.654 - 00:30:24.740, Speaker A: They like to control the taste and the so as you think about what you're building towards in the future and you evolve the company makeup, the culture, you think about bringing Other Side to life. Is there something in particular that keeps you up at night? I'm sure there's many things, but what would be one thing and how do you turn your anxiety into a positive momentum in the company?
00:30:25.130 - 00:31:46.320, Speaker B: Yeah, Other Side is hugely ambitious and there's more people that are going to be working on that than anything else in the company and it's going to just keep growing and so it's tricky. I just think about who's hiring for other side is like my biggest thing and process because just trying to think about the things that scale. But as part of that too is how do you teach a game designer? Who doesn't know anything about Web Three like the principles of this thing in a way that they can grok quickly and not just put in their mouth, design wise or otherwise. The way I keep doing that, I think we keep elevating people essentially out of the community or mods or other things and trying to put them in positions of power as checks and balances on this stuff. And the best people that come out of Web Two embrace that love, that, take it to fishwater, and then they join in. And if they're not, you just got to find a way to move on and find somebody that will.
00:31:50.610 - 00:32:27.020, Speaker A: I guess, maybe one last question for you. So you've had a tremendous journey and ride. It's only actually been two years, right, since you a little more than two years since you launched, but I think have come a tremendous difference distance as you think back on the journey and the decisions that you've made along the way. Sort of anything that with the full knowledge of hindsight you would do differently, or advice that you would give to the crypto startup school team as they embark on what you guys started.
00:32:28.430 - 00:33:02.550, Speaker B: I mean, I think you all have like a massive leg up on so many stuff with this group. Abel and just the connections just in the room among you, probably. We started no idea how to do anything business wise in terms of, like, you know, and the weirdest thing was, even when we made money and could throw money at the problem, I couldn't find an accountant that would even want to work with us. They were like, what is this? What it's the swamp club for apes on the Internet. Go away. And I was like, I'll pay ten times your alley rate, just like, do my taxes.
00:33:05.530 - 00:33:06.710, Speaker A: Nobody would do it, right?
00:33:06.780 - 00:33:58.798, Speaker B: Yeah. Or they said they would, and then you wouldn't hear from it was like, it was a disaster. So, yeah, my wife learned QuickBooks to be our first accountant, and there's all kinds of weird stories like that. So I think, looking back, it's funny, I didn't know how equity worked until we were going to raise a pretty big valuation. I think part of it has been like we were just kind of segmented in our little hole for a long time, and we didn't know anybody. We were just focused on what we were building and we were just talking to our community on Discord, I think the outward networking and connections and investor relations and all that kind of stuff, we were just late to that game. And so I think that was probably a mistake.
00:33:58.798 - 00:35:23.614, Speaker B: And the other thing is just also trusting your gut more because we had that impostor syndrome of not knowing what we didn't know. You might think that, oh, somebody who has run XYZ company is going to come and help us on this thing or that thing, but some of that stuff doesn't work out. And having somebody that just finding the right people that are like, if you're lucky enough to have a community at the start, finding people out of that community is just I'll sing those praises all day because we were finding people that were just like mods that we I would send mods, and we were hiring for community managers. So we'd say, hey, I don't know what your situation in life is, I don't even know your real name or anything about you, but if you want a job, we can pay 60 grand a year or whatever it was going to be at the time, but don't be offended if you're a hotshot. And sure enough, one of our best employees to this day, he was like a VP at a bank. But before he told us that, he was like, yes, I will take your job for 60 grand or whatever, because he believed in it so much, just like finding the good that's already forming around your company. And crypto is a very small space, so there will be people that show up in your discord.
00:35:23.614 - 00:35:32.002, Speaker B: Just get to know them and find the good and nurture those relationships because those have been the most worthwhile.
00:35:32.146 - 00:35:47.100, Speaker C: Hi, greg jay from ethan ID. Thank you for the wonderful talk. My question is concerning that tension between speculators and hoddlers or the true believers in your community. I'm curious how you got negotiated with that.
00:35:48.190 - 00:36:44.560, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us, it's always been around. The secret is then don't try and make a pointy moment. Try and keep it sustained. And that way if you're not shouting out like, we're about to do something spectacular rocket ship emoji, rocket ship emoji, moon emoji, whatever it is that's catnip for speculators. And we just tried to be very upfront about managing expectations on what we would be doing and being authentic with the community and engaging with people. If you're talking to people day in and day out and they're part of your community and you're in discord with them, they want to stick around. This is more than just a $5,000 NFT or whatever it is to them.
00:36:44.560 - 00:37:19.800, Speaker B: And if you're thinking about what that person wants and what that person needs, that's a much better signal. Wiley would talk a lot about, like, the person who's still holding an ape to this day, who bought it for $200.02 years ago. What's that guy like and how do we build for that person in mind? Of course, some people might get mad and be like, oh, but I've just bought my ape last week for x amount of money. But I think having that long term view has been very healthy for us and something that we think about a lot.
00:37:20.810 - 00:37:21.382, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:37:21.436 - 00:37:21.942, Speaker B: Sure.
00:37:22.076 - 00:37:36.366, Speaker C: Hey, greg, thanks for the talk. This is Jess from blockus. We build web. Three gaming infra. First of all, I just want to give a shout out for that creator to Web Three Founder moment. I think that's super awesome. Creators for the longest time did not get the spotlight that way.
00:37:36.366 - 00:37:57.666, Speaker C: So I feel like NFTs really brought that out. And that's super cool to hear your story and just see that trend in general. My question is really around how do you think about scaling community? Right? So if you look at the actual PFP holders, there's like a couple tens of thousands, but for a big, you guys are leaning heavily into gaming. So for a big MMO, you need a couple million concurrence.
00:37:57.698 - 00:37:57.846, Speaker B: Right?
00:37:57.868 - 00:38:01.126, Speaker C: So how are you thinking about scaling and growing that community?
00:38:01.308 - 00:39:09.066, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's like the giant question that everybody's thinking about. Of course. Honestly, for me, I think more about how do you do it in a sustainable way? So to me, it's around how do you do this in a way where everything that we say about Web Three gaming, which is like, hey, it's the same, except you actually own your assets and you take custody of them. Instead of Magic The Gathering online, where it's like you don't actually own them, it's like real magic cards where you do own the magic cards and you can take them home with you. How do we keep that part of it safe and alive and keep out a lot of the speculation or the feeling around safety and security, that that's what kills scale, actually. And so for me, it's like we think a lot about design and UX and UI stuff around that and communicating extremely clearly. If you follow us on Twitter, you'll notice every single tweet we put out.
00:39:09.066 - 00:40:08.110, Speaker B: We say, and this is the last tweet in this series of tweets. And any tweet under this is a scam because Twitter is completely broken and we have, like, a blog that is the most our news site is actually hilariously bad for new people coming in, but it's very good for people to know whether or they're on the right site so they don't click a bad link when they're excited and get their board apefished. And so to me, it's like as we start to solve some of these infra problems and like, UI UX things and wallet stuff, a lot of these other problems will get easier. We already saw what massive demand for a thing that wasn't properly meeted when the infrastructure wasn't there to meet it looked like. And what that looked like was a lot of people getting their assets stolen.
00:40:08.450 - 00:40:18.980, Speaker C: Hi, great talk. I'm Marie Ale from Mentorport with the platform that does geolocation for Web Three. You mentioned Discord a lot, and I'm wondering if any tips to start that Discord community.
00:40:19.590 - 00:40:52.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know how I'd probably be the worst person to ask because I know so many people get like, I get DMs even like, oh, I want to be a moderator for your discord now, or all that. And I'm like, I don't trust you at all. I have no idea. This is scam central. When we started, it wasn't like that. It was easy enough to find people that were being authentic and that you felt like you could trust and all that. I will say I think the best advice around moderation is important.
00:40:52.410 - 00:41:44.300, Speaker B: I know the Forgotten Runes guys, they said once they made a decision to moderate their discord, like, it was like their living room of their house. And I think that's great. It's like so you've invited this person into your house so they're okay to be there, but what are you okay and not okay with this going on here and treating it that way, I think was like a really good. Just North Star on what's going to fly and what's not going to fly. And then finding the right moderators with the right sense of judgment. One of our absolute best moderators, our first one, our first paid community manager. We offered her the job after she was a volunteer moderator helping out, and we were astounded how good she was at this, and we're like, can you come full time? Work for us? We think you're amazing.
00:41:44.300 - 00:41:54.334, Speaker B: Tell us about yourself. And she's like, yeah, I'm a third grade teacher. And I was like, oh, this makes total sense how this is working here. And yeah, awesome.
00:41:54.452 - 00:42:48.660, Speaker D: Hi, thanks for advice. I'm Nikita with chain patrol. We actually stopped phishing attacks targeting communities with a wallet block list. But my question actually isn't related to that. I was interested in Other Side, and it has some MMO aspects or some of these areas, but I'm a heavy gamer and a lot of MMOs, they built years in advance, and they have like, a long roadmap, and they basically tell you exactly what they're going to give you. And you've kind of taken an inverted, almost approach here where it feels like the roadmap is like giving out pieces. And one, how did you decide to go through this kind of inverted approach? And how do you keep your community excited while and also having faith in that you're going to kind of deliver everything?
00:42:49.350 - 00:44:24.190, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we've been blessed that we launched Other Side after we'd done a lot of stuff to build up our community. And I think part of it too, is we want this to be a creator platform in addition to essentially thinking about two different modes, like creative mode and campaign mode kind of thing. And doing those two things in conjunction has been tricky, but I think we have the right roadmap for that going forward. And to me, it's also around creating special moments for other people to participate in and hopefully have a much more active role in building alongside us. We have a lot of engaged creators that are constantly 3D modeling different things and testing out how they might look in our world or any other world. And as we start to open up the doors for more and more developers, starting with more pro ones and more amateur ones, I think that's going to be the virtuous cycle that keeps them going, because that's what we saw also with BYC and anything else is that the best way to build a community is to give them stuff to do and ownership in a thing. And with BYC, that was as simple as this is your ape, you're part of this club, and you have the IP rights to this, and you can launch a business off it or do whatever you want.
00:44:24.190 - 00:44:29.890, Speaker B: And that was much more powerful than we could have imagined, and a lot of stuff has come out of that.
00:44:29.960 - 00:44:49.786, Speaker D: If I can ask just one more quick question. What are your thoughts on PvP in this space with Pokemon cards playing for keeps or, like, RuneScape wilderness where you go and lose all your gold to somebody that killed you? What are your thoughts around that, where these assets are worth, like, thousands of dollars?
00:44:49.968 - 00:45:40.710, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's tricky because the other thing that's going on that's underneath that question, I think, is like, cheating. Anytime you have huge stakes like that, your cheaters are highly incentivized, and there's no game out there that hasn't people don't find a way to cheat. And so I think it's a constant negotiation of like, all right, how do you create spaces for people to opt into hardcore Red Server mode or whatever it is, but how do you punish people? Like, keep the incentives properly aligned so that you don't spin out and have a horrible situation where cheaters are winning assets for crazy amounts of money and you have no way to intervene?
00:45:41.450 - 00:45:42.090, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:45:42.160 - 00:45:42.778, Speaker B: Sure.
00:45:42.944 - 00:46:00.880, Speaker E: Great talk, Greg. I feel like ever since we got into CSS, it's just been a bunch of frameworks and mental models of how to build a startup. I'm curious if you have any sort of particular mental models or frameworks that you use on a day to day basis for making decisions when it comes to web three IP or running Yuga as a whole.
00:46:04.550 - 00:46:44.382, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. I think some of the refrains that we would have, I don't know if it quite qualifies as a mental model, but it's like kind of just constantly asking yourself if you are being authentic to your community in that moment. We put together a list of ten ways of how we like to communicate. For example, when we realized we were getting big enough that we weren't scaling how we talk. And so it was as simple as never pat yourself on the back. You don't take victory laps. If you do something right, then the community will celebrate, and then you can celebrate alongside them on the moment.
00:46:44.382 - 00:47:40.014, Speaker B: But if you're celebrating at first, that just looks bad. And I think a lot of times it's also just trying to think from a founder perspective, like, are you actually doing the thing that can scale? That's actually like the hardest thing you should be working on at that moment, or are you doing the thing that you're more comfortable with? I think for the first year, it was very easy to wake up in the middle of the night and feel like, oh, I got to go work on this thing right now because no one else is going to do it. And then you can fall into a place, though, where it's like, cool. There's 130 people working here now, and a bunch of them are executives or other things. Surely someone has thought of XYZ or you just tell part of your brain that somebody's got that. But I don't know, I find that it pays to be paranoid and a little crazy that way.
00:47:40.052 - 00:48:00.022, Speaker A: I mean, I'd add just like, looking from the outside, that you and Wiley both have an unbelievably high bar in terms of what good looks like and you're unwilling to compromise in terms of nothing gets out the door. I think that doesn't meet that bar and that's hard to maintain that and unusual, but you guys do it great.
00:48:00.076 - 00:48:45.700, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that's the last thing is to having a co founder that can really push you and that you're pushing them constantly. That was always like wynn and I were extremely codependent and crazy with each other. We would literally be talking through every decision for 6 hours on the phone every day because to us, especially with web three, the decisions that you make are just the start of an interaction. You're basically creating rules for an ecosystem. And if you're not being thoughtful about that, then your ecosystem can spin out in all kinds of unhealthy ways. And so some things as simple as who we would ban for the discord and from what in those early days, we might argue about that for 6 hours before we did it.
00:48:45.700 - 00:49:00.454, Speaker B: But hopefully out of that we would come up with some general idea of like, okay, that's how we're going to handle this decision will scale. We're not going to argue for 6 hours every time we ban someone, but we needed to do this today to feel good about this going forward.
00:49:00.652 - 00:49:10.330, Speaker E: And just as a follow on, you brought up the keyword authenticity. Is there any way to quantify authenticity? Like any KPIs or metrics that you look to to measure authenticity?
00:49:10.670 - 00:49:56.858, Speaker B: No. And we're really bad at KPIs. Where I am and Wiley is we were both writers and I was a poet, and it just doesn't work for my brain that much. It was more just about like, does this feel phony? Is this fake? Am I mimicking what somebody else would do? And some of our most successful moments were coming from like, okay, how do we remind ourselves and other people about something that makes us unique leading up to the mutants drop? It was like the tweet was like, fuck it. Mutant Saturday or whatever. But it was important in that moment for us to be like, yeah, we're just four idiots in a room trying our best here, like, nonstop. We're not a big corporate thing.
00:49:56.858 - 00:50:11.742, Speaker B: We shouldn't treat it that way. And so trying to be intentional around how we interact with our community, I guess, and be authentic. Cool.
00:50:11.796 - 00:50:12.640, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:50:13.410 - 00:50:15.610, Speaker A: All right, thank you. One more time for Greg.
