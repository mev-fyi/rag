00:00:00.090 - 00:00:36.770, Speaker A: The Internet is a network of protocols. Some are charmingly compact and simple. This is a state diagram of Http and some are dizzying complex, like this infamous interaction diagram for Maker Protocol. There are all kinds of protocols out there internet protocols, physical protocols, political protocols and more. On the left we have an intersection interaction diagram. And the thing that unites them is there are formal systems for interaction that facilitate complex group behaviors. That's a key underlying component of a protocol.
00:00:36.770 - 00:00:58.506, Speaker A: What makes an internet protocol so powerful is that you can interact with it, not just with people, but with software. And as we know, software is incredibly malleable and performant and has all kinds of interesting other kinds of mechanisms you can build in. So internet protocols end up being maybe one of the most important, if not the most important category of protocols that we have at our disposal.
