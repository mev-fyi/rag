00:00:00.170 - 00:00:20.894, Speaker A: Lots of crypto used in the world of blockchains. The problem is you have to know what you're doing. Right. If you try to implement cryptography, is one of these things that's like an area where a little bit of knowledge is really quite dangerous. Yeah. If you just know roughly how things work and you kind of try to throw things together, very likely the system will work, but it will be insecure. Yeah.
00:00:20.894 - 00:00:45.590, Speaker A: This is a very important thing to remember. It's easy to get systems to work so that they'll do what they're supposed to do, but they'll be insecure, and you'll never know it until somebody else points it out for you. So in that sense, it's an area where it's really important to know to use cryptography correctly. If you use it incorrectly, you end up with a bunch of hacks. And that's actually what I want to talk about today, basically, how to use cryptography correctly in the world of blockchains.
