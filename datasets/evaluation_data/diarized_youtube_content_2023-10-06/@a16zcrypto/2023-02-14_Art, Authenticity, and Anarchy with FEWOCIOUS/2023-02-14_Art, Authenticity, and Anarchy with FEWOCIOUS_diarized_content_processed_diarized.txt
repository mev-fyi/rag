00:00:15.850 - 00:00:48.700, Speaker A: Dang, there's lots of smart people in here. I was listening to y'all talk. I was like, dang, I just make art. I didn't graduate high school. Math is hard. And look, the whole time, it felt like I was walking on a tightrope with no net underneath, hoping my mama wouldn't ask me, where's your cap and gown? I'm going to be painting for you all today. But I only got ten minutes, so don't expect it to look like the Mona Lisa or anything.
00:00:48.700 - 00:01:07.474, Speaker A: I always knew I could do it. You know, a lot of bad stuff has happened to me. I didn't think the universe would do all that. And then life stays bad. That's crazy. It. I'm so young.
00:01:07.474 - 00:01:41.180, Speaker A: I have so much time to make my life great. But even then, I didn't think I had a shot at the life I currently have. And trust me, I was ready to work weird jobs. I was ready to try and sell my art for years, and no one buy it. I didn't care about how much money my art sold for. I just cared about being able to make it. I love art.
00:01:41.180 - 00:01:59.086, Speaker A: I need it. I couldn't live without it. When I was younger, my mama would come in my room, and I'd be drawing. I'd be so excited. I'd be like, oh, I get to show my mama my art. But she'd yell at me. She'd say, your art is scary.
00:01:59.086 - 00:02:29.286, Speaker A: She'd pick it up, she'd rip it, and she'd throw it in the garbage, and I'd sit there, and I'd cry. I'd cry and cry. But I kept making it over and over. I kept making those scary drawings because I loved it. I love art. My mama also wasn't accepting of my gender identity. You see, I'm transgender.
00:02:29.286 - 00:02:55.038, Speaker A: When I tried coming out to my mama, she really did not like that. What I'm trying to say is, I grew up in an abusive household, and I think, I don't want to stay here forever. I don't want this to be my life. I don't want to deal with these people. So I made an escape plan. I was 14 in math class. Hate math.
00:02:55.038 - 00:03:08.134, Speaker A: Saw a kid over there wearing a stupid hoodie. And I thought to myself, damn, I could make that. So I did. I made a website. I put up all this stuff. Turns out, making a website's hard. Took me hours.
00:03:08.134 - 00:03:33.774, Speaker A: This is a tech summit. One of y'all could have helped me. I made this website, and I put up shirts, pants, posters, stickers. Prints, socks, phone cases, anything I thought someone might buy, I put it up there. And I was so nervous when I got my first order. Whoo. I remember I got jitters on everything.
00:03:33.774 - 00:03:49.270, Speaker A: I packed the order. I put extra stickers. I wrote them a long letter saying, thank you. You're my first order. You care about my art. Oh, my God, thank you so much. I shipped it out, and it was a taste.
00:03:49.270 - 00:04:31.754, Speaker A: A taste of, oh, if I keep doing this, I might get somewhere. I might do something with this. But I knew in my heart, selling phone cases wasn't going to get me out of an abusive household. So I thought, and I thought, what did the greats do? What do all the people I admire do? Basquia, Keith Herring, Van Gogh, Picasso. They paint. They make these beautiful, beautiful paintings that people talk about for years. Why'd they do it? They did it because they loved it.
00:04:31.754 - 00:04:44.282, Speaker A: I thought, well, I love art. Let me try that. So I make paintings. I painted and I painted and I painted. I made two of them. I put them on my website. And I was so excited.
00:04:44.282 - 00:04:59.170, Speaker A: I was like, someone bought my prints. Someone got my stickers. Maybe, just maybe, someone might want my paintings. I waited. I waited. Six months went by, and no one wanted it. But I wasn't hurt.
00:04:59.170 - 00:05:23.100, Speaker A: I was like, it's not my time. Whatever time goes by, painting, doing my thing. I get an email. I look closer at the email. It says, the painting sold. I look closer again. It says, the buyer lives in New York.
00:05:23.100 - 00:05:37.530, Speaker A: New York City. I've seen that place in the movies. My paintings are going there. Isn't that where all the fancy art galleries are? Maybe this guy has a fancy art gallery. I don't know who bought it. He's anonymous. Pack the paintings.
00:05:37.530 - 00:05:47.362, Speaker A: Write a long letter. Oh, my God. You like my art. Thank you so much. I write a whole thing. Ship it out. Didn't get an email back from the guy.
00:05:47.362 - 00:06:08.554, Speaker A: I thought that was kind of weird. Come on, man. I wrote you a long letter. Whatever time goes by, I get another email, like four months later, and it's the same guy. He says, let me pull out the email. He says, I received your paintings. I live in New York.
00:06:08.554 - 00:06:34.270, Speaker A: I love your paintings, but I live in New York. I don't have room to put art anywhere. Do you know what digital assets are? Do you know what nfts are? Do you know what non fungible tokens are? I thought it was a scam. Non fungible tokens. What kind of phrase is that? Tokens. When I think of tokens, I think of chuck e cheese. Non fungible.
00:06:34.270 - 00:07:19.470, Speaker A: What the hell does that mean? Crypto. My mama watched Telemundo, and she told me that cryptocurrency is the bad, evil Internet money. I definitely couldn't tell my mama I'm learning about crypto, but didn't want to dismiss it. I'm gonna learn about it. I got google, so I googled it. What is ethereum? What is cryptocurrency? What are nfts? Went to Twitter, Nft, and I found artists. Artists in crypto.
00:07:19.470 - 00:07:39.810, Speaker A: What? And it was cool. It was like this weird, glitchy art I've never seen before. It was bright colors. It was video art. That's video. I saw that they were making a living off this Nft stuff. I saw they were making royalties from their painting.
00:07:39.810 - 00:08:21.122, Speaker A: What royalties? Okay, I've done googling on Picasso and Basquiat, and I know they ain't making a buck off royalties. What's going on here seems a little too good to be true. I should try it. So I thought a little bit about it. I told you all my mama would rip up my art. How do I bypass that? How do I get into this crypto universe and make art without my mama finding out? I'm going to go digital. You see, there's flaws in this.
00:08:21.122 - 00:08:47.386, Speaker A: I'm painting, I'm a run out of red at some point. I'm a run out of canvas at some point. This wood costs money. How much was this easel? I didn't buy it. A 16 z bought it. But still, this tarp, like, these are costs. And I can't go to my mama and be like, mama, I want to be like, Picasso, buy me $30 paint, $60 canvas, and when I'm done with it, let's hope someone buys it.
00:08:47.386 - 00:09:15.094, Speaker A: A stranger from the Internet? No way. Saved up with my phone case money. Bought a terrible laptop from Walmart, and I made art on it. Made nfTs. Had all these files, minted them, minted a lot of them on a platform called Super Rare, and honestly forgot about it. I thought it was weird. Whatever.
00:09:15.094 - 00:09:44.110, Speaker A: Went to school. I'm getting all these emails saying I got a bit of 0.5 ethereum. Zero two Ethereum. I didn't know Ethereum could be converted to us dollars. So I was like, cool, video game points, I don't care. But then I got a little curious, and I googled.
00:09:44.110 - 00:10:19.482, Speaker A: All right, I have a bid of 3.5 ethereum. How much is that to us dollar? Google says $1,000. $1,000? What? People what? People are bidding on my for $1,000 and I'm selling $10 phone cases. I obviously accepted the bid, so I have $1,000 in my wallet now. I can't fathom that it's real. I'm only 17, so I can't even take it out and convert it to us dollars.
00:10:19.482 - 00:10:52.900, Speaker A: That ended up being great in the meantime because Eth went up anyway. I have a see that my art can sell. And in this world I meet other artists, I collaborate with them, and I feel free. And it kept happening. People kept buying my art. The numbers kept getting bigger, and by the time I turned 18, I had enough money to move out of that abusive household. I was free.
00:10:52.900 - 00:11:29.440, Speaker A: I did it, but I wanted to make sure it lasts. I didn't want it all to fizzle away. I thought, well, what do I do next? People had that $69 million NfT sale. Christie's learned about Christie's. That's where they sell the Picassos, the Monets, all this art that I looked up to. So I emailed them, hello, Christie's, can I talk to you? Turns out Christie's checks their emails. They said, yeah, sure, let's talk.
00:11:29.440 - 00:11:57.926, Speaker A: They gave me a solo sale during Pride month May, a solo sale. And so many people tried to buy my art that the website crashed. I think the craziest bit about it all is that sale. It was called hello, I'm Victor Fawosius and this is my life. And it's how I came out. Before then, I was kind of anonymous online and I wouldn't talk about my gender through this sale. I came out as trans.
00:11:57.926 - 00:12:10.560, Speaker A: And honestly, a lot of my collectors were like, cool. I really like your art. Nothing's changed. Awesome. And I was like, what? I was hiding from my mama this whole time. Like, it's okay. It was okay.
00:12:10.560 - 00:12:32.914, Speaker A: And for the first time, I was me. People would call me Victor. I didn't feel like I had to hide anymore. And that was empowering. I guess what I have to say here is web three freaking changed my life. I mean, I've changed so much. I've grown so much.
00:12:32.914 - 00:13:01.600, Speaker A: I did not expect my life to end up like this. I'm at this cool conference with all these really smart people. My art has changed so much because I've grown so much. So much has happened. And, you know, the future feels limitless. I dreamed about making cartoons, weird video art, painting in front of people, making my own clothes. I get to do it now.
00:13:01.600 - 00:13:50.000, Speaker A: And art is this process of looking inward and thinking about the parts of your heart that you want to share with the world. I started making art when I was 13, and when I look inward, all those dark, sad, broken bits of my heart are so full of light. Now I'm 19 years old, and web three is this new landscape for all these new artists and builders and creators to explore and run around. And I know web three can be weird and confusing and a lot's going on right now, but I love it. Oh, I love it. I don't remember the rest of my speech and I'm almost out of time, but I'm just really excited. It.
00:13:50.000 - 00:14:01.450, Speaker A: I'm just going to paint now for the restaurant.
