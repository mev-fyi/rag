00:00:07.350 - 00:00:07.900, Speaker A: You.
00:00:10.110 - 00:00:33.518, Speaker B: All right, welcome everyone, to this afternoon's a 16 Z crypto research seminar. Very happy to introduce Shy Bernstein from the Harvard Business School, where he, among other things, co directs crypto and Web Three center with our own Scott Commoners, among others. And for those of you that think stablecoins are boring, shy is going to tell us why. Actually, they're very much not. So, all yours.
00:00:33.614 - 00:01:36.850, Speaker A: All right. Thank you very much, Tim. So just maybe in two sentences, just quickly about myself. I mean, I joined HBS about three years ago. I was at Stanford for about seven years, at the Graduate School of Business for almost eight years before then, my main focus of research is thinking about the intersection between financing and technological innovation, trying to think a lot about entrepreneurial ecosystems and the role of venture capital and other financing arrangements and how they influence the ability of firms to innovate. The last few years, I got roped into and got very excited about Blockchain and started these centers with Scott and among a few other projects, this one is on stablecoins, together with Paul Apostolicus and Alexander from Harvard and Slava Foss from Boston College. In fact, this is incredibly early stage work to the extent that we don't really have a paper.
00:01:36.850 - 00:02:00.960, Speaker A: This is the first time that I'm showing what we have. So I'm very excited to share with you what we found. We don't have a model yet. This is just a bunch of facts that we were trying to understand better. So I'm very much looking forward to your feedback. So just conflict. I don't think I need to convince you guys too much about the importance of stablecoins, but I'll do that anyway.
00:02:00.960 - 00:03:23.938, Speaker A: So, stablecoins emerged to become one of the largest use cases of crypto. In 2022, the market peaked at $180,000,000,000, which declined quite significantly ever since, but still quite sizable, settling in 2022 over $7 trillion, which is more than double than the processing of Visa and Mastercard. Now, the future or the promise of stablecoins has various aspects. One is this idea that we could generate this more efficient and cheaper and faster payment system, which might be particularly important in cross border payments, where the transaction costs are incredibly expensive and settlement can take multiple days. But the other promise of stablecoins is this idea that it might enable access to financial services, store of value, and access to US. Dollar, potentially in emerging markets and for populations that either don't have access to traditional banking services or unable to afford traditional banking services. But more realistically, the way that stablecoins are being used today is mostly enable, leverage and store value within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
00:03:23.938 - 00:04:56.854, Speaker A: Now, in order to enable stablecoins to fulfill their promise to a large degree, we really need to understand both liquidity and run risks considerations of stablecoins, which is naturally top priority for regulators and policymakers. So what are we doing in this paper? We are going to try to understand how market preferences shift during periods of significant market stress between different types of stablecoin designs. And by market preferences, I mean both traders and liquidity providers. The reason why I think it's important is we basically want to understand whether there's this notion of flight to safety within the stablecoin industry. And if so, what do markets deem to be safe during periods of significant stress? Whether there is one particular stablecoin design that seemed to dominate the others, or is it more event specific kind of stablecoin design that preferred by markets? All right, so just kind of briefly remind you how stablecoins are able to maintain their Peg. So ultimately it's a very simple story of supply and demand that is met by Arbitrage shares. So imagine, let's say USDC is traded in a secondary market at a price above one.
00:04:56.854 - 00:06:39.270, Speaker A: Then effectively what would happen? These Arbitrage shares will go to Circle the issuers of the stablecoin and pay cash in return for additional USDCs which they would sell at the secondary market for profit. Circle will take this cash deposit in the reserves and mint additional stablecoins, basically moving the supply until the price again meets the Peg. Now, if the price of a stablecoin basically goes below $1, then the reverse will happen, which effectively the Arbitrage will buy stablecoins in the secondary market and will basically take them back to Circle and will ask them to redeem these assets back in return for dollars. So Circle will have to basically redeem some of these reserves, convert them to cash and give them to the Arbitrage heirs and in return will take these USDCs, burn them, lower the supply, and again this profitable arbitrage will exist until we're contract back to the Peg. Now, the idea is that the ability of the issuer to defend the Peg depends on market belief that the issuer has the ability to meet these kind of redemption requests. So I need as a trader to believe that every time that I want, I can go to Circle, give them the digital representation of my dollar and get my dollars back. Okay? Now of course, it depends a lot on what exactly the issuer hold in reserves.
00:06:39.270 - 00:07:42.166, Speaker A: As long as the market believes that these reserves are sufficient to maintain the Peg, so there is no question about the ability of the issuer to actually provide to sustain these redemption requests, then the market will sustain its Peg. There's no problem with that. But imagine a situation where the assets that are maintaining their reserves are actually quite volatile and there might be concern that the assets may be the value of these assets may be lower than liabilities in this kind of situation. This might lead to initial shock to the expectations of the market about the ability of the issuer to meet these kind of redemption requests and may can trigger this bank run like behavior where investors will basically go and try to get back their dollars. But if reserves are insufficient then this conflict can lead to complete panic and even debt spiral and complete unraveling of the stablecoin.
00:07:42.278 - 00:07:52.606, Speaker C: Are you thinking this more of like a bank run kind of model or more like the Morphin shim, like defending the currency attack? Do you think of this more like a bank run or more of like.
00:07:52.628 - 00:08:47.550, Speaker A: A yeah, so I think that effectively I think about that very much like a bank run. When there's some expectations that they might not be able to honor their commitments of giving me my dollars back. I'll basically try to go ahead before everyone else to get whatever is left in these reserves. Now there's significant heterogeneity across different types of stablecoins in terms of how they maintain the Peg. And the heterogeneity or the design choices of different types of stablecoins vary across several dimensions. One most importantly is what exactly they hold in reserves. So Fiat backed reserves, for example, in the case of USDC and Tether, they basically maintain off chain assets like cash and cash like securities.
00:08:47.550 - 00:09:39.070, Speaker A: But the alternative is basically for example, MakerDAO through the creation of Dai. They maintain mostly cryptocurrency in reserves because cryptocurrencies are particularly volatile and that may generate concerns about the ability to maintain the Peg. They require also significant over collateralization. So for each dollar of die you actually need to contribute significantly more in cryptocurrencies. And then finally there's these algorithmic stablecoins that basically generate reserves using completely created tokens. The ability to maintain the Peg depends on the beliefs of the market that these tokens are valuable. And as we've seen in the context of Terra, these things could lead very quickly to debt spirals and unravel.
00:09:39.070 - 00:10:31.710, Speaker A: But the composition of the reserves is only one dimension. There are other important dimensions, for example the level of transparency. If you maintain assets on chain then it's pretty fairly easy to understand what you have in reserves. If the assets are off chain then you may need to hire auditor, depends on the frequency of auditing and depends on the market's beliefs of the reports produced by the auditors that would influence the level of transparency. There's also variation obviously in the nature of decentralization and the compliance with different types of jurisdictions. Now these different design choices of stablecoins impose different types of risks. So the most important risk of course, is credit risk in which the market may concern that the assets, the value of the assets might be lower than liabilities.
00:10:31.710 - 00:11:31.902, Speaker A: But there are also custody risks. For example, let's say that you maintain assets off chain. Then if your banking partner is subject to insolvency or financial concerns, that may influence may generate important spillovers to the ability of the stablecoin to maintain its Peg. And of course there's also regulatory risk. So if in a certain jurisdiction there is a tendency to ban or apply sanctions on the kind of stablecoins then again it might affect the value of these stablecoins for different types of users. And of course there's this technological risk associated with these smart contracts. Now, what's interesting is that we have here a situation where there is effectively a competition between different private money issuers that have quite progenyous design choices and they're subject to different types of risk.
00:11:31.902 - 00:12:42.278, Speaker A: It might seem as a novel problem, but in fact this is not the case. So there is this interesting quote by Governor Brennar that basically mentioned that the period of the 19th century when there was active competition among issuers of private paper bank notes in the United States is now notorious for inefficiency fraud and instability in the payment system. Now, so in the 19th century we had fairly similar situation. Now, I'm not suggesting that this is where we are today, but definitely it's worth trying to understand what exactly this competition between different types of private money issuers imply for trading and liquidity. So let me be more specific about what we're doing. The first question is going to understand how this competition between stablecoins affect trading or the composition of stablecoins holding. Is it the case that there's flight to safety during periods of significant risk? I mean, the null hypothesis, which is a little bit of a strawman, suggests that the market may not may perceive these different design choices for stablecoin as perfect substitute.
00:12:42.278 - 00:13:36.570, Speaker A: If that happens, of course we should see no change in composition of what kind of stablecoins the market holds. But otherwise we might see that there is kind of flight to safety if the market perceived one type of stablecoin safer than the others. So this would also allow us to empirically evaluate market preferences to different types of risk. The second question that we are interested in is trying to understand if such compositional shifts exist and traders start to push and change their composition towards one type of stable coins versus the other. Trying to understand the behavior of liquidity. We're going to try to understand the behavior of liquidity providers. So obviously, liquidity is really essential for the functioning, the proper functioning of the markets, especially during stress.
00:13:36.570 - 00:14:51.710, Speaker A: We are entirely going to focus on decentralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges, as was discussed yesterday, provide incentives to liquidity providers in the form of fees. So if periods of significant market stress that are associated with high volume of trade, we might think that this might trigger additional liquidity provision to the market. But alternatively, it might be the case that liquidity providers are facing such a significant adverse selection that even the increased revenues from fees may not be sufficient to compensate liquidity providers. And the compositional shifts triggered by traders may also lead to reduction of liquidity in the market, basically further amplifying the situation. And finally, we want also to understand investor at regenerative in terms of who are the liquidity providers and how they react. So for example, you may think that sophisticated deep pocket wallets may be more resilient to these kind of shocks that we are going to explore and as a result, they might be able to sustain these shocks and add contrarian liquidity.
00:14:51.710 - 00:15:47.080, Speaker A: Or alternatively, they might be more sophisticated and might be actually quicker to remove liquidity from the market, triggering additional reaction by others. Okay, so let me quickly tell you what we find and then I'll show you a bunch of pictures. So we find that during periods of significant stress and I'll be more clear what I mean in a moment. We find that there is a significant volume of trading of stable to stable pairs. And so we find that the market seemed to move quite dramatically to what it perceived to be safer stable coins. And these stable coins, what is perceived as safe depends a lot on the type of risk that trigger the particular market stress. So it's not the case that there is one stablecoin design that dominates the other.
00:15:47.080 - 00:16:54.250, Speaker A: And the second thing we find that despite the increase in revenue fees during these particular types of market stress, liquidity providers tend to remove liquidity very quickly, particularly from exactly those stablecoins that are deemed to be less safe. So in a sense, the flight to safety of the market triggers increased run risks on these kind of other stable coins that the market perceived to be less risky. And this is amplified by the removal of liquidity of exactly these assets. And finally, deep pocket wallets or sophisticated wallets seem to at least similarly to everyone else, remove liquidity. If anything, they are just doing that faster. Okay, so how we are basically evaluating that. We are basically going to focus on stablecoin paired trading which basically you can think about the two sides of the transactions.
00:16:54.250 - 00:18:03.566, Speaker A: There is a swap of stablecoins. So effectively it's equivalent to the trader that holds the demand for US dollar digital representation but prefer to hold it in different form than the other. And to do that we're going to focus on curve which is a decentralized exchange with an AMM that has this linear invariant through most of the curve that is better suited to enable the trading of stable coins with stablecoins. And I'll talk more about that. It is in fact the biggest exchange that facilitate this kind of trade. And for now I'm going to show you the results specifically from the three pool, which is the most liquid pool on curve that enables the trading of USDT of Tether, USDC of Circle and Dai of MakerDAO. Okay, basically let's start with the first question of whether there's this kind of flight to safety during periods of significant stress.
00:18:03.566 - 00:19:26.438, Speaker A: So it turns out that it's actually very easy to reject this null hypothesis. So if we're looking at the volume of trade in the three pool, where in the red this is basically the volume of swaps and in blue this is the volume of liquidity provision. What you can see is that there are particular times in which there is massive increase in volume of trade. It's actually very easy to understand what triggers each one of these peaks. For example, you can see that the collapse of Terra or the collapse of FTX or the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to massive volume of trades of these Stablecoins. You can also see here that the Pegging of, if you recall the magic internet money which led to concerns about the Pegging of UST also triggered this kind of volume of the Pegging of the algorithmic stablecoin of Tron also created significant volume of trade. And finally here, this is triggered by the SEC Suing PAXes because of allegation that binance, USD is in fact a security again triggered significant volume of trade.
00:19:26.438 - 00:20:44.638, Speaker A: In fact, if you look at the ten top days of volume, the average volume is about $2 billion, while the remaining days outside of these top ten events is roughly $100 million. So it's 20 times higher in terms of volume of trade. Now, the question, of course is what exactly happened during these events? Is this just driven by noise traders or there's some directional trades that shifts one type of stable coins towards the other following these kind of events? So we are mostly going to focus on these major events in which there is significant trading volume. Now, you could actually see what happened within the pool when you basically look at the composition of the different types of assets in the pool over time. So the blue represent Dai, USDC and USDT in equilibrium. If they're all Pegged to the same underlying asset, the dollar, the only difference between them is the particular mechanism that enables the Pegging. So if the market views them as complete substitutes, we should expect that the pool will be fully balanced.
00:20:44.638 - 00:21:38.306, Speaker A: So we'll have a third of Dai, a third of USDT, and a third of USDC. But what you can see that there are periods in which there's significant deviations from these equal proportions of the pool. For example, over here, this is when Terra collapsed. And what you can see is that basically traders and liquidity providers withdrew both Dai and USDC and basically they added more USDT in return. Okay, so the proportion of USDT increased from about 30% of the pool to almost 80%, suggesting that markets reacted quite dramatically with respect to the terror collapse. And you can see that these periods, you can see the other events here as well. So this is when FTX collapsed.
00:21:38.306 - 00:22:25.970, Speaker A: This is when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, where basically traders withdrew almost entirely the USDT from the pool dumping USDC, as there were results about the ability of USDC to sustain their Peg. Should I view that when the relative proportion is exactly a third, a third, a third, that means the price is equal. But if it's not a third, that means that some coin is worth more than the other, even though they're both US. Dollars. No. So the AMM, the invariant of curve, basically maintain a price of one, even if you're deviating from the equal proportion. And I'll come back to that towards the end, the curvature.
00:22:25.970 - 00:23:28.860, Speaker A: So if we're just looking within the decks, the curvatures, once you get to significant deviations from the balance only then you start to see deviations from the $1 peg. So this is why, and I'll talk more about that, curve has various mechanisms in which they're trying to push both liquidity providers and traders back to balance. But deviation from price stability, you need to find only extreme movements. So for example, if we're looking at the USDT prices relative to this, so you see that USDT moves in this event, but there are other events in which USDT moves, but you barely notice these price effects. Similarly, if you look at USDC, again, the proportions of USDC change quite a bit. But the pegging in terms of pricing happens only when the pool really moves away from a balanced proportion. Yeah.
00:23:28.860 - 00:24:21.878, Speaker A: From this graph, it looks like USDT is somewhat recovered, even though this is not the case. Or is this the case USDT recovered? Yes. So it's not USD. So it's not the Terra, it's the Tether stablecoin, which is backed by fiat by cash and cash equivalent assets. Okay, so what I want to do next, basically I'm going to show you a bunch of pictures. Basically I'm going to look at different event studies that are triggered by different types of risks. So for example, first I'll show you events that basically there is major increasing uncertainty in the crypto market, driven by the collapse of FTX and Terra.
00:24:21.878 - 00:25:24.030, Speaker A: Then we'll move to explore what happens with the third party risk, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and then some regulatory risk. And we'll basically zoom in on this picture that I showed you and basically see how market preferences to different types of stable coins emerge. So in mean, in my research at Conflict, I tend to run regressions and various econometrics. But in this case, I mean, the pictures are sufficient to tell the story. So for example, when Terra collapsed, you see that up to the event of Terra, the pool was fairly balanced. So this is basically the percentages here represent the proportion of USDT, USDC and Dai in the pool. But when Terra collapsed and there was significant uncertainty in the market, you see that basically traders and liquidity providers, I'm not distinguishing between them yet, started to withdraw USDC and Dai from the market.
00:25:24.030 - 00:26:52.306, Speaker A: And the proportion of USDT increased dramatically from about 30% to almost 85 90%, suggesting that there were a lot of concerns about the quality of the assets of Tether, which also was particularly not transparent about the quality of these assets. And during periods of significant uncertainty. The market was concerned about the ability of Tether to maintain the peg and sustain redemptions. And as a result, it seems like the flight to safety here was basically towards either Dai or USDC, both much more transparent, stablecoins that it was much easier to evaluate the extent to which they might be able to sustain redemptions if needed. So you see that basically traders tend to shift the type of still they're interested in holding stablecoins. But the type of stablecoins, the mechanism in which it sustains peg is entirely different. Now, if you are interested just in understanding the traders behavior, the liquidity takers, you can see basically similar story when you can see a significant decline of significant decline in the amount of USDC and Dai available in the pool which is exchanged by USDT.
00:26:52.306 - 00:27:00.678, Speaker A: Okay, so the amount this is here in millions of dollars, you see the increase of USDT question.
00:27:00.864 - 00:27:29.414, Speaker B: So you could imagine sort of shifts in demand being caused by things other than just sort of risk attitudes. One concrete example would be like if the price of ETH is plunging and everybody has these over collateralized loans on MakerDAO, all of a sudden they really need Dai desperately so they can sort of close out their loans. It's not so much that they think the other stablecoins are bad, it's just the maker only accepts Dai. So is there going to be any effort to try to tease apart these different things?
00:27:29.532 - 00:28:42.346, Speaker A: Yeah, so it could be that also the yield you might get on different types of stablecoins in other instruments are kind of different that also may shape your preferences. What we kind of did so far is basically we tried to look at the yields, for example, on Ave, how they react to these kind of events and whether they can explain these kind of shifts. If anything, we find the opposite. So first of all, the magnitudes here are enormous in terms of, you see kind of almost a billion dollars of USDC and USDT are basically being taken out of the pool. One way that we could explore directly what you're saying is basically see where this money is going. So do we see that if there are suddenly very attractive yields somewhere because of these changes, we might see that these stable coins are being directed to various DeFi protocols so we can actually trace that. The second thing is that when we were just looking at yields in Aved, we didn't see that this can really explain, if anything, it was going the other direction.
00:28:42.346 - 00:28:53.242, Speaker A: But there's still kind of like much more that we need to do in terms of tracing what were the purposes in which what these wallets basically did with these assets after withdrawal.
00:28:53.306 - 00:28:58.046, Speaker B: Yeah, because yield optimization doesn't really seem like a good fit for looking at these sudden price shocks.
00:28:58.078 - 00:28:58.322, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:58.376 - 00:29:03.938, Speaker B: I mean, when Terra is crashing, I don't think too many people are worried about getting 5% instead of 4%.
00:29:04.024 - 00:29:04.274, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:29:04.312 - 00:29:05.134, Speaker B: Implementing protocol.
00:29:05.182 - 00:29:05.490, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:05.560 - 00:29:15.880, Speaker B: Whereas this idea where you actually need a specific stable coin because it's the only one you can use to close out certain positions. That is an in the moment kind of interesting.
00:29:17.550 - 00:29:30.570, Speaker A: Yeah. So that would be in the context of MakerDAO. So we could definitely look at that. In particular, the explanation for USDC might be need to think about how that would work.
00:29:30.640 - 00:29:38.810, Speaker B: One thing you could do is like after the swap, does the stable coins that they swapped into, do they do anything with them exactly or do they hold them exactly? That would give you some indication.
00:29:38.890 - 00:30:38.610, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. But the interesting thing is that this story, you've basically seen very similar picture that emerges when FTX collapsed. Again, one thing that is not clear to me, first of all is why USDC and Dai are traded in this almost perfectly together within the pool during this time period. I guess there was some stories that Dai was kind of like almost entirely backed by USDC. So maybe that was kind of like led them to be traded so similarly. But in any case, you kind of see again that when FTX collapsed again, we see major shift in the composition of the pool where traders are basically taking out USDC and Dai in return for basically dumping into the pool USDT.
00:30:38.610 - 00:31:34.990, Speaker A: And again, you see kind of like the swap activity and how it affects the quantities. Now another story is basically looking at regulatory activities. So that's kind of like a different types of risk. So for example, tornado cash, which is decentralized mixer, was banned by the US office of OFAC and arguing that it had played a central role in laundering more than $7 billion. Following the ban, circle started to freeze and blacklist addresses that were associated with tornado cash mixer. And that created the surge of concern about privacy, the autonomy of being able to use USDC. It raised concerns about what are the next steps of the US office of OFAC subsequently.
00:31:34.990 - 00:32:52.890, Speaker A: Interestingly, Tether responded to the US regulations or the US sanctions by claiming that well, first of all, we are not supporting American customers or conduct business in the US. Therefore we view this as we might voluntarily choose to do that, but we feel no obligation to comply. What this triggered, as you might suspect, is a significant withdrawal of USDT out of the pool. These kind of concerns about additional sanctioning of USDC led to replacement of USDC with Tether. So again, conflict regulatory arbitrage in this case, well, it's a little bit harder to see, but there's this conflict replacement of different types of digital representation of the underlying US dollar, but now moving to assets that are less subject to this regulatory regime in which the USDC was forced to blacklist wallets associated with tornado cash. In fact, you see very similar story also when the SEC sued Paxus. So this is very recent.
00:32:52.890 - 00:33:50.686, Speaker A: So when the SEC announced that it intends to sue the stablecoin issuer Paxus because it was alleged that the binance USD is in fact an unregistered security because of various privileges binance provided to holders of BUSD. Paxus, in response halted minting the new BUSD tokens. At the same time, it raised concern about, okay, what does SEC do next? And again, you see this regulatory arbitrage where the, within the three pool, there was this substitution where there was withdrawal of USDT, which is less likely to be subject to the US. Regulatory changes. So again, these kind of like regulatory risks seem to shift what kind of stablecoins traders were interested in terms of holding. And then the final thing yeah, in.
00:33:50.708 - 00:34:06.070, Speaker C: All these graphs, USDC and dai are really closely correlated and USDT is not is it always the case, like even on normal trading days, that USDC and dai are better correlated than yeah, so.
00:34:06.140 - 00:35:17.100, Speaker A: We need to further check that. But I think that the correlation of USDC and dai increased dramatically over the last few months. One speculation is because they kind of heavily used USDC as a collateral, although I checked this morning and that was not the case. So I don't really have a good answer for you right now in terms of how come these two are such, so highly correlated within the three pool. But we need to check also whether there is highly correlated also outside. So finally, while there are benefits from having these kind of off chain assets in reserve that are either cash or cash like securities, because of the increased stability, you also have to depend on a banking partner that will store these assets for you off chain. The silicon valley bank collapse was kind of like a really nice not nice, but it was kind of like a reminder of the third party risk in which stablecoin might be dependent these kind of stablecoins might be dependent on the traditional financial system.
00:35:17.100 - 00:36:23.794, Speaker A: When silicon valley bank experienced a traditional bank run, circle announced that in fact, about $3.3 billion of its reserves is in fact stored out of the $40 billion is in fact stored in reserves at silicon valley valley bank. And there were significant concerns about the ability of circle to get access to these assets. And naturally, once you are subject to this kind of third party risk, immediate, as you would expect, you see that within the three pool, there was immediate withdrawal of USDT as a replacement of USDC, while the amount of USDT almost got to zero. Then you also started to see that people were starting to pull out die just to substitute USDC. And then around March twelveTH, the US. Government announced that all depositors will get their money back.
00:36:23.794 - 00:37:46.822, Speaker A: So conflict, the uncertainty subdued, but again, you can conflict see how the third party risk led to this massive reallocation and this kind of flight to safety of stablecoin traders. Okay, so just to summarize, now I want to talk about the liquidity providers, but basically the point. Of going through these event studies is just to illustrate that first of all, there's this kind of flight to safety that various types of events that are driven by aggregate market risk, regulatory risk or counterparty risk are leading traders to change the type of stablecoins they want to maintain. So the mechanisms through which stablecoins maintain their peg expose them to different types of risks. And again, we don't find that there's a single dominant stablecoin design that holds all these different types of risks. So every time we find that, the market seems to kind of jump to different types of stablecoin depending on the nature of risk. What's also quite important is that once there's a run to one type of asset, it's exposed the other stablecoin that are deemed as less safe to increased run risk.
00:37:46.822 - 00:38:39.610, Speaker A: Okay, so that conflict generates these kind of negative externalities in the market and basically this notion of competition between stablecoins during this period of stress may impose this additional increased run risk. Now you might also argue, well, this nature of flight to safety is just a feature of this emerging technology and maybe this is just early days in stablecoins and therefore this might disappear. A counterargument may suggest that flight to safety may persist as long as there are differences in regulatory risk, reserves, quality risk, and counterparty risks. As long these kind of risks maintain, then we will continue to see this kind of flight to safety across different types of stablecoins. Okay, so let's talk about liquidity provision.
00:38:41.070 - 00:39:01.426, Speaker C: In terms of being early in like a technology risk. How likely do you think it is that eventually some of these will just collapse and the market will consolidate around one stable coin? Because if there are different types of risk, but they show up sort of stochastically, you might expect eventually one of them collapses, or two of them collapse and you're left with the strongest of.
00:39:01.528 - 00:39:55.746, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think that definitely it seems like that. There's consensus among regulators in the US and Europe both against algorithmic stablecoins towards fiat back types of stablecoins. So it's still conflict to be seen how regulations across different jurisdiction and to what extent the different jurisdiction will actually collaborate with each other to ensure that there is kind of like one standard of stable coins. As long as there's no collaboration across jurisdictions and different jurisdictions enforce different standards, then we might still see this kind of flight across different jurisdictions, we might still see variations in quality of reserves and this kind of risk may continue to persist. Okay, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time about yeah, you.
00:39:55.768 - 00:40:12.650, Speaker B: Concluded the last slide talking about the different types of risks. Did any of your examples I'm curious what you mean by counterparty risks and in particular separately from what you already have from reserve's quality risk like your circle example that's also a counterparty risk or just reserve quality risk.
00:40:14.750 - 00:40:34.660, Speaker A: You mean the Silicon Valley bank example, that's the one you yeah. So basically when you have off chain assets, you have to rely on traditional banking in order to custody your assets and therefore you're subject to risk that these banks may suffer some significant shocks. So that's what I mean by which.
00:40:35.270 - 00:40:37.582, Speaker B: Eventually translates into reserve quality risk.
00:40:37.646 - 00:41:17.374, Speaker A: Right, exactly. So it's kind of like it's a subset of the reserve quality risk. Ultimately everything boils down to the credit risk. Right. The bottom line is can you sustain redemption requests and the counterparty risk and also the aggregate market risk may also influence the volatility of the assets that you have in reserves and might kind of expose you to ultimately different types of credit risk or the lack of transparency is also going to increase concern about credit risk. Right.
00:41:17.412 - 00:41:25.262, Speaker B: I guess the distinction I had in mind, you could imagine a counterparty risk, which is not that you could imagine having counterparty risk even when they're fully collateralized and they just don't like you.
00:41:25.316 - 00:41:25.834, Speaker A: Right.
00:41:25.972 - 00:41:37.270, Speaker B: Versus so there's a distinction of like can you not redeem because they literally don't have it or can you not redeem because they're sort of censoring you in particular? Yeah, so those seem distinct to me.
00:41:37.340 - 00:41:44.934, Speaker A: Yeah. So for some reason they decide to ban or to ignore your request, which.
00:41:44.972 - 00:41:46.546, Speaker B: I don't think is there in any of your examples.
00:41:46.578 - 00:43:00.298, Speaker A: But in principle you can yeah, at least empirically we don't have it, but potentially you can imagine that if there were centralized protocols that at some point they will freeze any redemption request or alternative to some degree. There are many example that in finance you can think about that banks provide differential treatment to customers or those who are kind of like they do with them frequently business and when you freeze asset because there is kind of like bang run on the stablecoin. Again, if it's not operated through smart contracts, there might be concerns that there might be this kind of preferential treatment which is interesting. We haven't observed yet this kind of example, but this is kind of interesting concern. For example, the way that circle works. They don't operate with permissionless set of arbitrage errors. They select a few and then you might have problems with one of the arbitrage might get into difficulties in terms of their relationship with circles.
00:43:00.298 - 00:43:55.874, Speaker A: So that conflict might be definitely an issue. Yeah, interesting point. Okay, so very quickly about AMM, so we talked about that yesterday, so I'm not going to talk about too much, but for example, the concept product AMM, you just need to maintain the same level of liquidity as the traded pair is traded against the curve. So imagine just a quick example. So imagine a situation where we start with a balanced pool that the price of B as effectively is one A, so they're fully balanced. Now let's assume that there is some price shock and the price basically drops to price of B drops to half A. So just there's this kind of aggregate market shock that leads to decline of the price of B.
00:43:55.874 - 00:45:38.914, Speaker A: Basically, what will happen in order to get to the price of half A, what we're going to see is that informed traders basically will sell eight bitcoins in return for six A coins and generate profit along the way and move the decks to this kind of point where the price is going to be half A, okay? Now, people typically tend to talk about, I mean we talked yesterday about lever other way that people are thinking about potential losses for liquidity providers is this notion of impermanent loss, which is you are comparing the pool value in this new point relative to a buy and hold strategy. So what happens the pool value is basically in the new point we're going to have 14 types of asset A and 28 types of asset B which are now worth half of asset A. So the value of the pool is going to be 28 A. But relative to the main problem is that in the buy and hold strategy, basically you didn't change the quantities. So notice that basically when you're trading along the curve, the quantities are shifting that the liquidity providers now hold more assets that are worth less. Okay? And as a result, if you were just applying the buy and hold strategy, you would still have 20 A and 20 B on the curve. Now you have 14 A and 28 of B which is now worth less.
00:45:38.914 - 00:47:16.110, Speaker A: So if you think about that in the context of stablecoin, what happens here is that if there are concerns about the price of the other stablecoin, basically traders will come in and take out the high quality assets and replace it with the lower quality assets. And as a result, there's this kind of adverse selection problem that informed traders are causing losses to the liquidity providers because they're draining the good stablecoins and dumping the bad stablecoins. In fact, if the price further collapses to 0.2 A, then you can see that the new point on the curve, you see even more extreme example where the traders continue to drain the pool from the high quality assets. That maintained the peg. And now the liquidity providers is left with 45 coin b type of assets which are not sustaining their Peg and only nine assets that sustain the Peg. So basically when there are informed traders and this is kind of like a general results also from more traditional finance, if traders are informed, then passive liquidity providers may suffer significant losses because particularly in the example of stablecoins, informed traders will come in and exchange high quality stable coins with stablecoins that are concerns about their peg.
00:47:16.110 - 00:48:18.086, Speaker A: So they kind of face this kind of significant adverse selection and as a result, the mechanism will try to compensate liquidity providers such that they will get significant share of the fees. Hopefully the fees will be sufficiently high to outweigh the potential losses that liquidity providers are facing when trading against informed traders. Now, Curve in particular has various interesting mechanisms in which they're trying to maintain the balance of the pool. One thing is the invariant. So as I mentioned earlier, the invariant of Curve has significant linearity that effectively almost mechanically as long as you're trading against the curve in these prices. Remember from yesterday's talk, the price is basically the derivative of the curve. So the derivative is going to be equal to one in this linear part.
00:48:18.086 - 00:49:24.486, Speaker A: So basically you're going to sustain price stability even if you're deviating from the balance of the pool. And the prices might start to change only in extreme cases. The second mechanism that Curve applies to try to maintain the pool balance is that they enable one sided liquidity provision. In fact, they will give you bonuses if you provide liquidity to the least demanded coin. And finally, there is also mechanisms of dynamic fees when you are deviating from a balanced pool, then Curve will increase the transaction fees again, hoping that this might increase the revenue from liquidity providers and as a result may encourage additional liquidity provision. Now the question ultimately is whether these kind of mechanisms on curves are sufficiently to offset adverse election losses that are associated with these kind of like major events.
00:49:24.598 - 00:49:30.330, Speaker B: Yeah, debt fee increases trades in both directions or just trades that go even farther out of whack.
00:49:32.590 - 00:49:35.610, Speaker A: As long as you're further away from balance.
00:49:36.830 - 00:49:42.430, Speaker B: So suppose there's a trade that comes in that's going to make it more balanced. Do they pay the higher fee?
00:49:46.230 - 00:50:15.530, Speaker A: As far as I remember, it's just kind of like on distance from the balance. To be honest, it's very hard to understand from Curve documentation what's going on there. So I'm kind of like this is based on like if you read the Curve v two white paper, it literally end with this kind of like equation. That's it. Yeah. And this is kind of like the representation of this equation. But other than that they don't provide any documentation.
00:50:15.530 - 00:51:45.698, Speaker A: But it's true that the actual transaction fees tend to fluctuate quite a bit depending on the distance from balance. But this is kind of like as far as okay, the question here is kind of like empirically are these mechanisms that try to ensure the balance of the pool is sufficient to compensate liquidity providers? And the answer is confect quite strikingly no. So this is simply the volume of trade during this particular period. So you would think that during this particular when the volume increased, this is during these particular episodes, then the revenues from fees increased quite dramatically. So you would think that, well, this should increase liquidity provision. But unless there's significant losses associated with this kind of adverse selection and what you can see that every time there is this kind of like significant period, you see a massive removal of liquidity. So the value locked in the pool shrinks quite dramatically, suggesting that whatever compensation curve offers to liquidity providers is quite far from being sufficient to entice liquidity providers to come in and provide additional liquidity.
00:51:45.698 - 00:52:52.510, Speaker A: And in fact, you can see this very clearly. For example, if we look at the collapse of FTX in the blue line, you see the swapping activity and the red line you see liquidity provision and you see that there's a significant decline in liquidity provision around the time that FTX collapsed. So exactly during times that you would think that liquidity is most needed to lower transaction fee or lower sleepage. In fact, we see that markets tend to almost to contract by a significant decline in liquidity. You kind of see similar reaction also when we're looking for die decomposition. The reason why I'm showing you that for every coin separately is because you could provide one sided liquidity for one of the tokens. You don't have to provide an equal proportion of liquidity in curve.
00:52:52.510 - 00:54:15.590, Speaker A: And finally you also see that there is also removal of liquidity also for USDT, even though almost simultaneously you see that people are trying to avoid they're basically dumping USDT in the market, but then at the same time they're also eliminating liquidity of USDT in the market. One interesting aspect, I mean, again, if you look at the Terra Luna crash, you kind of find very similar results. One kind of interesting exception is that you see that for USDC when Luna crashed, there was initial spike in liquidity provision, at least temporary for a few days. But then as conflict losses accumulated, liquidity was removed nevertheless from the market. But conflict, it doesn't matter how we look at that. You kind of see that liquidity provision essentially disappears during these kind of events. And this is also you see also similar decline in liquidity also during Silicon Valley Bank and across basically all other cases.
00:54:15.590 - 00:55:49.990, Speaker A: The last point basically what we find is that despite the increased revenue from trading volume, despite the increased fee structure due to deviation from balance, and despite the increased incentives to add liquidity to least demanded stablecoins, we see across the board removal of liquidity during periods of significant market stress. So it seems like these kind of incentives are not sufficient. There's a quite interesting distinction from the operation of market making during traditional finance where basically the spread is going to react to market forces. Liquidity providers or their limit books will basically increase the spread when they're facing more informed trading. But in curve these parameters are basically set through the Dow. So they're basically just set it's not these parameters of the nature of the incentives are being set exogenously and not as reaction to market forces, definitely not in the few days right after the shock happens and the lack of market forces shaping the incentives. We see that basically these parameters are not set empirically, it seems like the parameters are not set sufficiently to offset concerns about adverse selection and informed trading during these periods.
00:55:49.990 - 00:55:53.846, Speaker A: The last thing that I want to show you, and I'll just mention that.
00:55:53.868 - 00:56:08.454, Speaker B: Very quickly, in fairness, the Bid Ask spread may well be infinite at equilibrium by market makers if the volatility is like sufficiently high. Right. Which is kind of the same. It's all liquidity being withdrawn.
00:56:08.502 - 00:57:02.410, Speaker A: Right, yeah. No, it's not clear that there is a set of I mean, of course, let's imagine a ward in which you dramatically increase transaction fees that might also kind of like as we heard yesterday, that might generate significant other consequences for arbitrage airs and so on. So it's not clear that there is a clear mechanism that would actually solve this problem. Or there's a set of parameters that could offset because for stable coins, unlike maybe ETH or stablecoins, the outcomes are incredibly binary. So you're not concerned that the price will drop by ten or 20%. You're concerned that the price will drop by 100%. So in such scenario, it's not really clear that you can design sufficient incentives to offset these kind of concerns.
00:57:02.410 - 00:58:29.370, Speaker A: So I completely agree, which it's an interesting question, given the magnitudes of these events, whether you can actually design parameters that would offset these kind of risks. Yeah, actually those pools look like they are actually designed to keep this balance when the fluctuations are low, but actually aggravating is when the fluctuations are high because it's like linear in the middle but suddenly derivative. Yeah, that's a really good point. So basically what happens is that because of lack of curvature, it makes it very cheap to withdraw to drain the pool effectively from the good assets. If there was more curvature, then the price changes would make it more expensive to remove assets and maybe that might limit the extent to which we see these sharp reactions on the pool. So there's this trade off. On the one hand, you want to maintain price stability, but on the other hand yeah, there's absolutely this kind of consideration, which kind of brings this question of maybe relates to what we talked about during lunch, which is kind of like, what exactly is the objective function? Are you trying to minimize slippage and transaction costs or are you trying to minimize run risks during periods of significant stress where maybe you'd like to increase the cost of removing assets from the pool?
00:58:31.470 - 00:59:06.258, Speaker D: My take from what you've said so far is sort of a little bit more optimistic. In mean, essentially you're trading here nickels for dimes, right? Two nickels for a dime. And of course, when there's some threat about, oh, maybe dimes are going to be withdrawn from US. Currency, so everyone shifts it to nickels. So you see these massive quantity changes despite the decreased liquidity and so forth, nickels are still trading two for a dime. Right. The prices are way more stable.
00:59:06.354 - 00:59:06.662, Speaker A: Right.
00:59:06.716 - 00:59:19.446, Speaker D: So you have massive quantity shifts and only tiny, tiny price shifts. And it's the price shifts we care about. So isn't this really actually showing, hey, stablecoins are actually pretty stable.
00:59:19.558 - 01:00:57.198, Speaker A: Yeah, we focus purposely on the three most stable stablecoins out there. If you venture a little bit outside to stablecoins five to 30, then you see that actually the price impacts become dramatically much more volatile. And secondly, the extent to which these stablecoins survived, they were depegged for some time and ultimately recovered. On the one hand, it's kind of like illustrating that market forces were able to kind of converge back to the peg, which it's a really important point. On the other hand, it's kind of like these mechanisms and market forces seem to nevertheless embed significant volatility in the quantities. You're right that the quantity fluctuations are going to translate into prices only in the extreme cases, but still you see that the quantity fluctuations are pretty volatile over time now to the extent so it kind of illustrates at the least, and I'll conclude here because we're out of time. So at the least, what we kind of find that there is significant flight to safety and the flight to safety is driven by different types of risks.
01:00:57.198 - 01:01:51.466, Speaker A: So it's not triggered by one type of risk all the time. And this imposes run risks on the least preferred stable coins that is amplified by removal of liquidity. So these are kind of like forces that go towards breaking the peg. The fact that it didn't ultimately or the peg recovered, I think is confarding, but it's not suggesting that these kind of forces are not important. If we're thinking about ultimately stability right now, you can also think about, well, this occasional volatility or depegging could be sufficient to prevent from the use of these stable coins use as money. Right? So when we use money, we don't ask questions. Well, is there kind of like particular features that are risky or not? We just use it.
01:01:51.466 - 01:02:25.794, Speaker A: And so as long as we're not there, that might be also a concern, but we can continue this conversation. Finally, the results that I didn't get to show you is that we find that sophisticated and deep pocket wallets do not seem to differentially provide liquidity. If anything, they seem to run first by removing liquidity from the market. So, super early. Looking forward to talk more to you. We're still trying to figure out how to continue move forward with this project. So thank you very much for your.
01:02:25.832 - 01:02:39.610, Speaker B: Comment and the very last point. So you made it sound like it's not I would have expected them to really be the first ones to flee, but what you said suggested that that was not very noticeable.
01:02:40.990 - 01:03:38.406, Speaker A: So this is the results where we are still kind of like we still need to make more progress. But what we did so far, for example, in the case of FTX. We look at the value of the wallets at the time of the collapse and we said, okay, let's see the reaction of the top quartile in terms of value of the wallets relative to the others. You can see that in terms of here we see the liquidity removal and you actually see in line with what you said, you see that those the top 25 top quartile based on the value of the wallet, they seem to remove liquidity first. And that seems to be consistent also for Dai and USDC. Another way we're looking at these wallets is based on the level of sophistication we look at how complicated the transactions that they tend to execute on curve. And again, we see that they seem to react first and withdraw.
01:03:38.406 - 01:04:36.240, Speaker A: In some cases they seem to react similarly, but if anything, they seem to be on average, move much, much faster. The other thing that was suggested to me earlier today is also to see whether exactly those that remove liquidity are also those that swap at the same time. So if you want to avoid USDT, you're not only going to avoid by swapping to USDC, you're also going to remove the liquidity of the market. So this is going to be almost like a double impact on the stability of USDT. And then finally we actually know who are the wallets who provide liquidity. We can see how concentrated are the liquidity providers and whether the liquidity removal is driven by kind of like the big whales, so to speak, or driven by more smaller liquidity providers, which is not consistent with what we find here.
01:04:39.170 - 01:04:50.130, Speaker E: Do you have any sense of the geographic region of these wallets or any sense from the data or anecdotally how those trends vary across different jurisdictions?
01:04:51.750 - 01:05:00.674, Speaker A: No. In fact, if you have any ideas how I can identify the geographic location of these wallets, that would be super.
01:05:00.712 - 01:05:03.502, Speaker E: Interesting guess like something like chain analysis.
01:05:03.566 - 01:05:11.706, Speaker A: Comes to mind, but that would be interesting. Yeah. Time of day. That's right. Yeah. So what hypothesis do you have in mind?
01:05:11.888 - 01:05:15.910, Speaker E: Well, I'm thinking of some of the promises you laid out at the beginning.
01:05:15.990 - 01:05:16.522, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:16.656 - 01:05:34.846, Speaker E: There's a lot of rhetoric and some anecdotal evidence of stablecoins being highly adopted in places like African continent for these reasons. So it could be interesting to see more fine grained between stablecoins and during these different points in the market.
01:05:34.948 - 01:05:45.140, Speaker A: Yeah. So time of day of trading could be an interesting way of looking at it. In general, I think that it's really interesting to see where it's adopted and how it's being used.
01:05:46.090 - 01:05:55.106, Speaker C: Exchanges are different countries have different exchanges, like central exchanges that are popular with them. Maybe you could link sexes to what's.
01:05:55.138 - 01:06:02.646, Speaker A: Trading on the right. Right. Cool.
01:06:02.748 - 01:06:05.722, Speaker F: I have two quick comments. Can everybody hear me right now?
01:06:05.776 - 01:06:07.158, Speaker B: Yeah, we can hear you, Sam.
01:06:07.334 - 01:06:08.106, Speaker A: Cool.
01:06:08.288 - 01:06:51.990, Speaker F: The first is on the USDC die pegging. There is a die has a thing called the PSM, the Peg Stability module that allows a one to one trade. It is capped, I think it's up to about $850,000,000 at this point. So that is probably why you see that because there's a risk free arbitrage created if it deviates on any other market up to $850,000,000 of liquidity. But that's pretty deep, even for big crises. And then the other thing would be at all of the times of all of these crises, USDC did back about 45% of die that has decreased over time. But at the time of all of those events it was backed.
01:06:52.510 - 01:06:54.220, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting.
01:06:55.550 - 01:07:12.380, Speaker F: And then, Tim, to your comment on curve fees, I think the fees are based on the price at the end of the trade rather than the beginning. So trades towards this engineer or towards rebalance have lower fees because it's the last price.
01:07:13.270 - 01:07:13.842, Speaker B: Makes sense.
01:07:13.896 - 01:07:19.600, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Sam. Awesome. Thank you so much.
