00:00:10.970 - 00:00:43.866, Speaker A: I think I know all of you here, but I'm, of course, Eddie Lazarin, the CTO for a 16 Z crypto team. And joining us today is Jing Wang, who is the who founded Optimism, and she was the CEO at Op Labs for a while before moving over to the Optimism Foundation, where she's the executive director. And of course, she's deeply involved in Optimism World and has been there since day one. So I hope you guys start thinking about questions to ask. She's very experienced in Crypto World, so join me in welcoming Jing, please.
00:00:43.968 - 00:00:45.580, Speaker B: Yo. Hi.
00:00:48.430 - 00:01:05.700, Speaker A: So we can go anywhere. This is very open ended, and I hope you guys will participate in the conversation. Maybe a natural place to start is Optimism. What's the origin story for Optimism? How did it begin? How did you meet the team? Just where did it all begin?
00:01:07.350 - 00:01:43.790, Speaker B: I actually used to be a bitcoiner I was a bitcoin maxi, but in 2016, the Bitcoin environment was not super friendly, especially to women. I remember at the very first scaling bitcoin conference in Montreal, there was 300 people and three women. So I remember complaining about this to a few friends and this dude named Vitalik, butyrin just so happened to be in the room. It was a really small community at the time, and he was like, Come over to Ethereum. Come contribute here. We have so many women. The executive director of the EF is a woman.
00:01:43.790 - 00:02:23.354, Speaker B: I was like, yeah, but I don't know anything about Ethereum. He goes, well, it just so happens that Ethereum researcher Carl Flush is currently mentoring someone else. And he could mentor you too. He could teach you everything you need to know. And I had just I used to say dropped out, but the reality is that I failed out of college and I wanted to find something that felt meaningful to Asian parents as a thing to spend my time on. And so when Carl offered two separate projects, he said, we could do a coding project or we could do a writing project. I picked the textbook project.
00:02:23.354 - 00:02:53.362, Speaker B: So he said to me, one of his mentees, he was like, great, you will write crypto economics textbook. There's a few chapters in there. You'll focus on plasma and his other mentee had just been laid off from his mechanical engineering job and wanted to learn how to code. So to his other mentee, he said, great, Hayden, you will learn solidity and you will make uniswap. Literally, bro. That's pretty fucking crazy. But that's how it started.
00:02:53.362 - 00:02:55.638, Speaker B: And as I was writing the and.
00:02:55.644 - 00:02:57.160, Speaker A: What do your parents think about it now?
00:02:57.770 - 00:03:04.520, Speaker B: You have to go back to college. This is not real education. It's a bitcoin money.
00:03:06.730 - 00:03:07.346, Speaker A: Wow.
00:03:07.468 - 00:03:08.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I know.
00:03:08.512 - 00:03:09.180, Speaker A: Good.
00:03:10.590 - 00:03:24.720, Speaker B: Even now, my mom's like, Where are you going to find a husband? What's your salary? What's equity? Yeah, that's good. It's fine.
00:03:27.570 - 00:03:28.910, Speaker A: So how did the team come together?
00:03:28.980 - 00:04:01.026, Speaker B: How the team came together is over the course of writing the Plasma section. Plasma is a scaling design that predates optimistic roll ups. It prioritized high transaction throughput, because back then, it was super early. What the fuck is product research or user research? No one was thinking about that. It was predominantly an academic exercise. And when people thought about scaling blockchains, people thought about transactions, not about computation. So we focused on scaling transactions with plasma.
00:04:01.026 - 00:04:40.966, Speaker B: I had to rewrite the chapter multiple times. There was no information available on the Internet. I had to just fly to where the researchers were and ask them things and write it down. And Plasma Research was moving so rapidly that each time I finished the chapter, I would have to rewrite the chapter because a new design would come out that increased throughput ten x yet again. I finally finished the chapter on an iteration of plasma called Plasma Cash, and it was the culmination of work from Kelvin, Fictter and Carl. And after I finished writing the chapter, I moved on to the next one. And a couple weeks passed, and I was like, why is we solved it.
00:04:40.966 - 00:04:45.222, Speaker B: We solved the whole ethereum scaling thing. Why is no one building this?
00:04:45.276 - 00:04:46.200, Speaker A: That's amazing.
00:04:47.370 - 00:05:33.014, Speaker B: So I took all the people that I had learned the things from and I said, let's build this. And that's how we started. Plasma group. And after a year of having our plasma testnet up and an average of about ten transactions per day, I thought why if scaling ethereum is, like the foremost problem in this industry and everyone's talking about it and if it was even in fact the first ever response to the bitcoin white paper when it was sent out on the mailing list this doesn't scale to the required size. And we've solved scaling. Why is no one using this? And so I hit up our friends at Ido. They set up some interviews for us.
00:05:33.014 - 00:05:49.110, Speaker B: Crazy. You should talk to your fucking users if you want to know if you're solving the problem. And people were like, this shit. We don't need this shit. This shit is way too complicated. We had developed this Plasma predicate system, a new whole new language for you to code. Things like uniswap.
00:05:49.110 - 00:06:30.586, Speaker B: And it was just like a horrible developer experience. What we realized people wanted was to scale compute, not transactions. People didn't care about doing 100,000 transactions per second. People wanted to pay less fees, and they wanted fast transactions. So we went back to the drawing board, and a month later, we pooped out the first ever optimistic roll up scaling design, and we partnered with Uniswap to do a demo of it. And it was the first time people had seen this UX of instant transactions. Our target was sub 200 millisecond confirmations, because that's the level at which it.
00:06:30.608 - 00:06:32.618, Speaker A: Feels yeah, like real time.
00:06:32.704 - 00:06:48.000, Speaker B: Like instant. Yeah. And now this instant Transaction sequencer model is now, like the standard across all optimistic roll ups. But at the time, it was really novel and really new, and we came to a 16 z and you turned us down.
00:06:49.890 - 00:06:51.310, Speaker A: Not me personally.
00:06:53.110 - 00:06:56.050, Speaker B: Anyways, that's how it started.
00:06:56.200 - 00:07:40.510, Speaker A: Great. So of course, the company and the foundation and the ecosystem has evolved significantly since then. And we're in the middle of tons of evolution in crypto. Everybody's thinking differently about how to cultivate really rich ecosystems, how to cultivate projects that own the infrastructure that they're building on in a way that's truly decentralized. Right. How has that vision unfolded? And I know it's still of course it's still happening now. Can you think of a few times that were sort of pivotal moments as this is all being figured out, that changed the direction for how optimism decentralizes?
00:07:42.950 - 00:08:32.590, Speaker B: Well, I don't think our direction has ever changed. Our understanding of the difficulty has evolved significantly and continues to evolve. I think the vision and the endpoint has always been clear. What hasn't been as clear is how to get from point A to point B. And I think when you put a bunch of really smart people in a room who don't have their prefrontal cortexes developed yet, the exercise is more about showing off how intelligent you are and how you design the solution rather than picking the straightest line from point A. Point PICU chuckling, feel your chain. So the big learnings that we've encountered along the way have been more about learning how to execute because we certainly didn't need any help in being ambitious.
00:08:32.590 - 00:08:34.034, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:34.232 - 00:08:40.660, Speaker A: So what are some examples of things that you've learned as things have grown regarding execution, in particular?
00:08:44.310 - 00:09:32.526, Speaker B: When you want to go faster, squeeze the plan, not the people, because the people burn out and the plan probably has a lot of fluff. So that's a big thing that we learned. Very interesting and how to make decisions. I think, especially when you're really smart, you can create narratives to justify your choices that feel like logic. Like, emotionally, there's not a huge differentiator between logic and rationale and emotion. And if you've ever gotten even in a relationship or a friendship, you both have your version of events and your conclusions that you draw from it. And no amount of sharing your logic with the other person changes their stated logic.
00:09:32.526 - 00:10:21.666, Speaker B: Both of you think that you're being purely rational when you know that the other person is being an egotistical asshole. Same thing with yourself. Like, you cannot convince yourself that you are behaving irrationally even when you are making emotional decisions, and those have a cost. And when you don't have a framework for how you want to make decisions, you change your mind. You make decisions inconsistently. You make it difficult for your team to model how you want them to operate and how you want them to think, which results in your teammates doing things that you don't agree with or that feel asinine to you, which results in you trusting their output less, delegating less, and then micromanaging. Just a whole bunch of things cascade from that.
00:10:21.768 - 00:10:46.406, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely sympathize with reasons. And logic sometimes come from emotions. Right. Not the other way around. Right. Sometimes if you feel a certain way, it's very easy to construct, especially if you're a capable, very clear thing, especially if you're very capable at reasoning. You're probably capable at using reasoning for your own emotional purposes.
00:10:46.518 - 00:10:47.820, Speaker B: Preach. Yeah.
00:10:48.590 - 00:10:54.560, Speaker A: So are there ways that you have realized or methods that are good at mitigating this?
00:10:56.290 - 00:11:51.342, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, I'm still making a bunch of mistakes. Each time I make one of these mistakes, I realize a new thing about how to make the decision. I think writing your decisions down is a big one. And then I think being clear with those around you when you are soliciting feedback versus proposing an idea, versus making a decision, because there's nothing in the variation of your tone or words that would indicate to someone what category those words fall under. It's not, like, obvious to others, but it is obvious to you. So just categorizing those inputs. There's a huge amount of confusion that you mitigate from that, writing it down, asking others to repeat back what they believe it is another huge one.
00:11:51.342 - 00:12:07.942, Speaker B: Sometimes I say protocol, and I'm not including bridge front ends, RPCs, you say protocol and you are including all of those things, and then things can happen as a result of us thinking that we've agreed but not really understanding what we've agreed to.
00:12:07.996 - 00:12:08.710, Speaker A: Totally.
00:12:09.130 - 00:12:09.880, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:10.410 - 00:12:39.726, Speaker A: Makes sense. Regarding optimism and cultivating developer interests and developer activity, earlier you mentioned talking to the users to figure out what they need. That was a critical lesson for plasma right, in the earlier days. Now I think we see a lot of interest and developer activity on optimism more than ever. What do you think is underneath that? Why is that? And are there things that optimism has done to cultivate the organic interest of the community?
00:12:39.908 - 00:13:30.350, Speaker B: I don't know if I agree. I think we need yeah, Carol was showing me this tic TAC toe game yesterday, this super fun game theory made by this dude named Winter, and it's just like a bunch of coordination incentive design, mechanism design. It's just a fun experiment. And where are all those people? Do you remember FOMO three d And I do. Those were so fun. Just completely unhinged use cases of the blockchain that you don't normally see. And so I wonder if DeFi and DeFi summer just created such a huge honeypot on a very specific type of product and nothing else because there was no financial incentives to do so if you could get rich quick overnight.
00:13:30.350 - 00:13:38.142, Speaker B: And so where are the developers that are putting genuine effort into creating something actually useful to the end user?
00:13:38.206 - 00:14:11.814, Speaker A: Well, I have a theory for this. I'm curious. Your view that since there's still of course, although things have cooled down a little bit on L1, gas fees are still very, very high compared to that period. Right? That period like FOMO three D period, like 2018 ish period. It still cost about a penny to send a transaction just because ethereum was so much less empty or less full. It's a little bit hard to experiment with totally goofy funny stuff if you know it's going to cost like 15 grand just to, like, you see you need to scale. Yeah.
00:14:11.814 - 00:14:43.846, Speaker A: So my genuine belief is that if there's enough block space to waste to do the goofy things, then people will do those things. Which is why I think scaling is a prerequisite of that period. It's not that there's less people experimenting, it's that they're kind of being crowded out by all the traders on DeFi, all the applications, all the NFTs bouncing around. Those things are still very much happening. We can all see the metrics. Does that resonate for you guys at all? Is that how you think about it?
00:14:43.868 - 00:15:38.860, Speaker B: How do you yeah, I think we tend to prefer the technical solutions to the problems rather than the business development or go to market or whatever solutions. So, yeah, we thought that reducing fees by ten to 100 X would be the unlocker for this wealth of new innovation to happen. But I think the reality is there's a threshold of cost, which is sub penny, at which the cost of a transaction feels negligible to the user, to the developer, and other applications can exist. So right now, transactions around $0.10, which we thought would be groundbreaking, earth shatteringly amazing to people, but it's still predominantly for people using structured finance products, DFI trading things where there's a profit that you can model and therefore justification for the cost.
00:15:39.310 - 00:16:16.980, Speaker A: I've played a few fully on chain games like that funny category, and they're so cool. But I've noticed even with those as constrained as they deliberately are in terms of compute, you still emit like thousands of transactions per day to play a game like that. Even at $0.10, that's prohibitively expensive. Although $0.10 sounds low, and it is low for certain types of things, it's incredibly low for a lot of really important types of economic activity that's still, in a way, incredibly high for goofing off. So that resonates to me.
00:16:16.980 - 00:16:34.922, Speaker A: I'm curious, are there other types of things that you think developers should be experimenting with? Like, are there things they aren't aware of or they don't think about enough? When it comes to messing around with Op stack and optimism ecosystem in general, what are the other things that you want to see more of?
00:16:34.976 - 00:17:12.310, Speaker B: I want to see some crazy, unhinged shit. I'm going to butcher this. And if anyone actually knows the history, let me know. But there was a scientist who loved clouds, and he really wanted to study clouds, and he created this machine to make clouds, and after a long time trying to get this machine to make clouds. He eventually abandoned this research, and someone else who worked in that lab was like, actually, that might kind of be a cool machine, and started taking over the research. And that's how the atom bomb was invented.
00:17:13.690 - 00:17:15.800, Speaker A: No, I don't know the story.
00:17:17.850 - 00:18:05.666, Speaker B: I guess my point is that there's, like, things that feel like toys that are passion projects that people work on. And it's that passion that brings you to utilize the blockchain in net new ways, counterintuitive ways. Like, the founders of Latice talk about utilizing the physics of the blockchain to create new game dynamics, generate randomness things like that. That is the kind of creativity that I would like to see net new use cases that weren't possible before, and I think they all look dumb, useless, stupid, unhinged dangerous to begin with. But ultimately, that experimentation is like, what outputs the killer app. It's like that book. I was there's a book over there called Kraken Creation.
00:18:05.666 - 00:18:20.570, Speaker B: Highly recommend you guys pick it up. Jennifer Duda, the researcher who discovered CRISPR, just chronicles all of the toy things that looked dangerous and dumb, that failed throughout history, that pooped out Gene.
00:18:21.570 - 00:18:22.126, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:22.228 - 00:18:24.080, Speaker B: Hopefully we can do it in less than a.
00:18:26.450 - 00:18:57.026, Speaker A: I mean, that anecdote is basically exactly what Chris always talks about with what people play with on the weekends. Ends up being what people work with on the weekdays later. Right. The things that the next big production, incredibly important economic system starts looking as a toy. Right? That's how it begins. I radically agree with that. What do you think these founders like? These projects? Everyone in this room, these are early stage projects.
00:18:57.026 - 00:19:06.986, Speaker A: They're just getting started thinking about what they're going to do, and the visions are definitely taking shape, but they're at the earliest stages of executing and building it. What do you think they should be asking you?
00:19:07.088 - 00:19:14.718, Speaker B: Is this like a seed precede? What is this seed situation? What should they be asking me?
00:19:14.804 - 00:19:15.440, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:16.130 - 00:19:17.550, Speaker B: Oh, shit.
00:19:19.730 - 00:19:21.920, Speaker A: Or maybe, what are things you wish you knew?
00:19:22.950 - 00:19:55.700, Speaker B: Yeah. Um, the people you recruit are really fucking important. And, like, everyone says this, and it's in all the books and everything. And somehow, like, I didn't truly understand this until I went through it. Literally, every founder you talk to, every fucking book, every VC says the people are the most important thing. Who hires the most important thing? A bad hire can set you back. A good hire can make or break it.
00:19:55.700 - 00:21:14.554, Speaker B: That genuinely is the case. And there's, like, wisdom that people passed me that I didn't understand until I made those mistakes, such as how to fire, how to implement culture. I would say that it's possible that you guys won't really understand those either until you're faced with it yourself. But one thing that you can do without experiencing it yourself is hire someone super experienced in specifically your areas of weakness. I think especially for smart nerds, it might be not saying that you guys are like this, but threatening to hire people that you consider smarter than yourself or more experienced than yourself, or to MIT your areas of weakness. But if you think about it like finding a mentor to supplement your areas of weakness, you will be doing yourself your own personal growth and your entire team a huge service. Because at this stage, the biggest thing getting in your way is your own goddamn self.
00:21:14.554 - 00:21:19.440, Speaker B: That is your biggest obstacle by far. And product market fit.
00:21:21.490 - 00:21:26.640, Speaker A: That's a big one. Cool. Well, I think we'll open it up for questions.
00:21:28.610 - 00:21:39.346, Speaker C: One thing that I saw that you did in your life is you found yourself with the right people. Kind of like, I imagine, I don't know, dark basement, I don't know where.
00:21:39.368 - 00:21:43.354, Speaker B: People usually don't hang out of a dark apartment. Windows.
00:21:43.422 - 00:22:08.240, Speaker C: Yeah, all right. In hindsight, you were with the right people. And I feel like something that my team is trying to do is exactly kind of like, similar, gets older, more experienced, or maybe not older, but just get in those type of situations where those type of situations happen. So how did you find yourself there? Openness or kind of like how could you replicate that, per se?
00:22:08.930 - 00:22:59.206, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, a 16 Z introduced us to our 9th hire, Josh Stein, and he's been second in command of a military interrogation unit. He was a federal prosecutor prosecuting cartels. He was also general counsel of Zenefits and had been the CEO of a securities token company himself. Don't skimp on cost like enrich that motherfucker, because they will multiply the value of your company. Do not be fucking stingy with the people that you rely on most. So that's like, first thing, just be open to that. And then when someone like a 16 Z makes an introduction to you, take it extremely seriously.
00:22:59.206 - 00:23:37.240, Speaker B: And even if it's not the right candidate for you, show respect to the people who made the intro and tried to put their reputation on the line with that candidate to help you. And that's how you get more and more referrals, more and more introductions. Yeah. So investors are a great place to start. I did a lot of cold reach outs. I would hit up my friends at other companies and like big tech companies, ask them to introduce me to their managers and ask their managers for advice and then follow up that with an offer.
00:23:38.910 - 00:23:47.286, Speaker C: Awesome. Second question real quick, just like, self awareness. I feel like you're a very self aware person emotionally, very intelligent.
00:23:47.318 - 00:23:49.340, Speaker B: How co founders may beg to differ.
00:23:50.270 - 00:24:01.460, Speaker C: But I feel like you're aware. You may not be aware of some things, but a lot you kind of sense that. How can you, again, continue to get better at that and make sure that you're being the best of yourself?
00:24:03.350 - 00:24:51.982, Speaker B: I think first you have to want it. That's where you start. And I struggled with being defensive early on. And one thing that happens when you become the CEO that you don't notice happening is that you will trigger other people's fight or flight more frequently than you did before. You go from some wimpy nerd in the corner to someone who now has, like, influence and you don't realize it because you're still the same person, but new people entering the company or the people around you know this. Your co founders may not feel this way because they've been with you since the very beginning, but new people entering see this. And so every single time you encounter feedback or the possibility of feedback, that shit is a privilege.
00:24:51.982 - 00:25:13.990, Speaker B: Receiving feedback is a privilege, and you have to show people that you deserve it just as much as anything else. It's risky to give you feedback. And so are you creating an environment for it? Are you actively seeking it out? And then are you proving to people that you've earned the right to continue receiving feedback?
00:25:14.750 - 00:25:15.210, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:25:15.280 - 00:25:16.170, Speaker C: Thank you very much.
00:25:16.240 - 00:25:16.954, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:17.152 - 00:25:43.330, Speaker D: Hi. Thank you for all the great advice. I'm Nikita from Chain Patrol. I had two questions. The first one back to the hiring and kind of bringing all these really talented people outside of the monetary kind of compensation. How do you convince somebody that you consider even better than yourself or to basically join your company? How do you get them excited? And what do you say to them?
00:25:43.480 - 00:26:24.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I'll say older. Whatever. Start. One benefit of finding a more tenured individual is that a lot of people who've already had a storied career in the next leg of their career, they're not trying to burn themselves out to put the cherry on top of their career. They are looking to assist somebody who is burning themselves out to put the cherry on top of their career. It's like a mentorship relationship. So it's really about your relationship with your mentor.
00:26:24.394 - 00:27:20.350, Speaker B: And I think mentors are powerful because mentors are people who can use a language that you currently understand to make you realize or understand new concepts without upskilling yourself or learning a whole new category of things. They're able to take your current level of understanding and expand it with the tools that you have right now. And those epiphanies are extremely valuable, but it is contingent on having good communication pathways. Like, when your mentor speaks to you, do you instantly just get it? Do you have a good time talking to them? Do you have good rapport? And this is the reason that they would also want to join your startup, is that they're getting a gratifying feeling of growing. You not just making deliverables.
00:27:20.690 - 00:27:21.006, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:21.028 - 00:27:23.682, Speaker D: So they're not just doing work. They feel like the impact is really important.
00:27:23.736 - 00:27:28.740, Speaker B: You are their work. Yeah, I see. Okay, and so find someone who wants to invest in you.
00:27:29.270 - 00:27:30.020, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:30.470 - 00:27:57.180, Speaker D: Just one more question. This is maybe a little less like founder related, but I was interested around the Op stack and kind of like, what was the decision making around making it building that because a lot of these chains are trying to kind of aggregate everybody into their community. And what was the decision making process around building this infrastructure that now like, Coinbase A 16 Z and all these others are building on top of?
00:27:57.490 - 00:28:06.266, Speaker B: For the first part of your question, are you saying do you mean what was the decision around open sourcing it when everyone is trying to build silos?
00:28:06.378 - 00:28:07.040, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:28:11.330 - 00:28:58.202, Speaker B: I think it's just a different model of thinking and it's really hard to get out of the web two rut into the web3 mode of thinking. Like instinctively you think that the way to capture value is to extract or create silos. And it takes like active effort to get out of that. The reason we open source it is because I think it's really powerful to become the standard. And don't get me wrong, I was extremely salty when the first three forks of optimism appeared. But in the Series B fundraising deck that we used to get more money from A 16 Z, we said this was an advantage of being the most copied code base. It meant other teams were testing our code in production.
00:28:58.202 - 00:29:20.470, Speaker B: It meant that we were the easiest to fork, it meant that it was the cleanest code and it meant that we were more likely to become the standard. And being the standard's body is also a position of value accrual, not just extraction. So that's the first part of that and the second does that make sense?
00:29:20.540 - 00:29:22.054, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes cool.
00:29:22.172 - 00:29:33.878, Speaker B: And the second part of the Coinbase A 16 Z thing, are you asking about the Tech stack modularity or are you asking about the super chain?
00:29:34.054 - 00:29:56.258, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I guess yeah, I was just seeing how do you view just like them building that in relation to optimism? And are you concerned either about potentially like liquidity moving or anything else? How do you see them in relation similar? There's obviously smaller, I guess. Smaller like forks. But these are like potentially got it.
00:29:56.424 - 00:30:49.380, Speaker B: Yeah. So I would say there's a difference between those who are forking the Op stack and then those who are building on the Op stack as part of optimism. So those who fork Op stack, Boba, Metas, et cetera, we don't accrue any direct value from those people with Coinbase, we do. So the Coinbase chain is one chain in what will be a network of chains, which we're calling the superchain. What we realized is a single blockchain, no matter what you do to it, is not enough to meet the needs of global computation, no matter what. So right now, chains are more akin to religious ecosystems. You've got like Tokens memes a church, it's extremely religious.
00:30:49.380 - 00:31:32.736, Speaker B: And in your MetaMask drop down, you have to connect to all these different providers and whatever. It's not a great user experience, but a chain isn't that different from a smart contract in a lot of ways. It is simply a container for compute on a different scale of complexity and feature sets. But we think of chains as contracts. So instead of thinking so chainly, in the future when the Internet is built on optimism, no one is going to know what a fucking blockchain is. Who the fuck cares? Do people know what a root zone is for DNS? No one fucking knows that shit. You just access the Internet.
00:31:32.736 - 00:32:19.552, Speaker B: No matter what ISP you're connecting from, you just access the Internet and you get to use your applications. So we're just trying to pull out of this thinking two chainly mindset just thinking about this as a container for compute. And then the work that we have to do is figuring out how to create a unified Wallet experience across all of these chains. Because right now, wallets are optimized for the chain as religious ecosystems experience. Coinbase is taking a big bet on us. And their chain is managed by Optimism Governance, and a portion of their revenues go into the Optimism treasury. So what they're paying for is the feature set of decentralization.
00:32:19.552 - 00:32:37.884, Speaker B: The chain can't be shut down, your upgrades are managed by Governance. And our next few months is getting more of these chains spun up and then building out sort of the cross chain message passing protocols. And then one day you won't even know what a chain is.
00:32:38.082 - 00:32:38.940, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:32:39.090 - 00:32:43.196, Speaker D: It's got like docker containers or something. You don't really care. Yeah, yeah.
00:32:43.218 - 00:32:44.140, Speaker B: Containers.
00:32:44.960 - 00:32:45.870, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:32:46.180 - 00:33:16.810, Speaker E: Hi, Jing Jay from Etherid. Thank you very much for your talk. So my question concerns this idea of narratives, and it appears that you're very gifted with explaining very abstract concepts in a relatable way. And you see how narratives can be very useful persuasion explaining concepts. But you also brought up that desire to scale back narratives when you're working with co founders in that space. I'm curious if there's a bright line of what defines a good narrative versus a bad one.
00:33:17.420 - 00:33:45.820, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. I would say that it's one skill set and there's two sides of the persuasion. There's persuading people to give you money, and then there's persuading people that you're right when you're really not. And how you know. Are you asking how to differentiate between the two? Yes. That one is hard. I think you have to develop a process for building conviction.
00:33:45.820 - 00:34:12.516, Speaker B: And so there's a lot of good decision frameworks out there. One way is categorizing a decision as reversible versus irreversible. And then in decisions you believe are reversible, then you look at how difficult it is to reverse. And some of those decisions will actually practically be irreversible. So take all the irreversible ones, set them to the side, don't make them impulsively. Take time. Don't let your anxiety dictate the pace.
00:34:12.516 - 00:34:23.420, Speaker B: At which you provide an answer to the people around you. It's okay. People can wait. The email can wait. The investor can wait. Eager beavers. It's their job to ping you incessantly.
00:34:23.420 - 00:34:56.920, Speaker B: Take the time, open it up to feedback to people you trust, and then write down your justifications for why you're making that decision. And if you change your mind, go back to the written justifications and ask yourself if you have any new data that would result in the decision changing. If you don't have any new data, you're being emotional. If you do have new data, go back through the write the justification again, get the feedback, so on and so forth.
00:34:57.900 - 00:35:11.390, Speaker E: I see one more question. Considering hiring for you, what is that stage that makes when you're evaluating a candidate that makes you go from yes to fuck yes? Like, this is the person that you absolutely want?
00:35:12.720 - 00:36:05.320, Speaker B: I think this is a skill that you develop and not one that I have developed. I have made just as many bad calls on hiring as I've made incredible calls. I think the best call I made was the founding team, but those guys I had worked with or known for a really long time. And one thing that I found helpful was, like, interview trading. And it sounds very like the Office and corny, but there's a skill set to extract information in a short period of time from someone you don't know well. And there's resources out there and you should go take a class on it. Sorry, not a great answer, but you'll find out over time what you specifically are susceptible to in interviews.
00:36:05.320 - 00:36:18.690, Speaker B: I am susceptible to the gift of gab. If someone knows how to answer a question concisely and eloquently, I make judgments about their intellect. And the two are not as closely related as I thought.
00:36:19.960 - 00:36:20.832, Speaker E: Thank you, Jing.
00:36:20.896 - 00:37:07.170, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you for the talk. David from disco. There's been a couple of projects that have been moving to non blockchain based, sort of decentralized technologies for social, and some projects that are trying to do social blockchains or put social data on blockchains. I'm curious what you think is going to happen, and I guess you were mentioning these sort of super chains and all this decentralized compute. Do you think there's going to be a lot of social apps that are interacting heavily with blockchains? Or you think maybe social is a place where blockchains might not be the right technology?
00:37:09.160 - 00:37:36.510, Speaker B: I think social is really broad. It's like just as broad as NFT or gaming something like Axie Infinity might be categorized as an NFT or game project, but it's a lot closer to how people interact with DeFi. So based on that, I don't know what will happen to the broad category of social. I can say that. Disco XYZ. Right?
00:37:36.960 - 00:37:40.648, Speaker A: Disco. Not the data backpack.
00:37:40.824 - 00:37:43.816, Speaker B: No, not the day backpack. The identity startup.
00:37:43.928 - 00:38:12.410, Speaker A: Yeah, not that one. Oh, sorry to disappoint they're great though. I have a call with them pretty soon. My app is a far Costa client right now. But yeah, I mean social as in like, I guess trying to go towards mass consumer social, like Twitter scale social apps that are primarily like user generated posts and content.
00:38:12.860 - 00:39:14.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's like two categories of innovation I'm really interested to see. One is like fundamentally can only exist on a blockchain. Like the Unhinged Moon 3D kind of thing I was saying earlier. And then there's another category of applications that could exist without a blockchain. It's simply that existing on a blockchain in a state space with other applications utilizing the same communication standards that creates a new format of innovation. By which I mean, imagine if Twitter were open sourced and it was a Web Three application and the Twitter back end were also open sourced. So imagine how much easier it would be to create new social network projects if huge swaths of code or functionality like that were already open sourced and in a composable state space.
00:39:14.750 - 00:40:11.870, Speaker B: There's currently no financial incentive for companies to open source the special sauce like that. So at Optimism we have this mechanism called Retro PGF, retroactive public goods funding, where we try to look at how much impact a piece of code has created and pay them fat stacks of tokens commensurate with the value that they've provided. So in the last round of Retro PGF, we distributed like $20 million with the tokens and every single dependency. And the optimism monorepo, even though it wasn't a blockchain project, got a payout. So for social clients, for any kind of application, if we are in an ecosystem that has easy incentive loops, where open sourcing key functionality that is otherwise really difficult for a startup to build, what kind of innovation would we see from that?
00:40:13.920 - 00:40:14.956, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:40:15.138 - 00:40:47.752, Speaker E: Really appreciate your founder wisdom. My name is Marat, I'm the founder of Primev. Primev is a block builder communication network for Ethereum l one, I'm curious about your take on mev or MAV on Optimism. And I have two parts to that. One as searchers and others, like interacting with the chain to back run or front run transactions. And two, as the sequencer and reordering transactions, possibly for whatever fair ordering or benefit and as that translates into decentralized sequencing over time.
00:40:47.886 - 00:42:07.528, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the whole ecosystem around mev has evolved really dramatically. I don't know that my opinions have adapted as quickly. I think that I'm very curious to see how systems like Espresso Flashbots adapt to these l Two state spaces. Also with the shared sequencing of the superchain, I don't know, I couldn't tell you what actual impact on user experience that would have. I think the sort of fallback answer internally is that just as there's these markets for bitcoin mining, I think in the future, distant future, the way that shared sequencing works is that there are these disparate entities that all run the same ordering function over a set of transactions to be provably fair or what have you not. And the compute powering, the sequencers is a pool of compute incentivized similarly to the way that markets around Bitcoin mining are incentivized. So it might be like AWS type entities now pulling their compute.
00:42:07.528 - 00:42:29.830, Speaker B: And that pool of compute is what's drawn on rather than individual companies like F. Two pool running a very specific targeted extraction algorithm over a set of transactions and then bidding up in an auction to see who gets to be the sequencer and then who's fucking the users. Too much gets kicked out by the decentralized governance, which was our original design for how we extracted profit from the system. And I don't think that's going to work.
00:42:31.000 - 00:42:31.764, Speaker E: I like that.
00:42:31.802 - 00:42:51.470, Speaker F: Thank you. Hey, Jing. Michael from blockus. We make infrastructure for web. Three gaming. So earlier you mentioned a framework for decision making. What aspects have you found work really well or aspects or pieces of it that help to solidify your decision making process to everybody else?
00:42:51.840 - 00:42:54.270, Speaker B: Tell me about a decision that's currently on your mind.
00:42:56.080 - 00:43:11.968, Speaker F: So one of them is chain support. So we try to be relatively chain agnostic and be able to support games in the best way. So kind of figuring out what the next piece to add on should be.
00:43:12.134 - 00:43:29.800, Speaker B: So how to prioritize which chain you next integrate? Yeah, framework for that would be optimism is the next don't make decisions emotionally, use logic well. What are you trying to enable for your user.
00:43:31.740 - 00:43:53.330, Speaker F: Right now? How we approach a decision like that is what the studio is looking for. Are they looking for distribution? Are they having performance issues? What challenges are they facing? But then there's kind of the investment versus reward on our side as well. So kind of trying to balance the two.
00:43:54.020 - 00:44:01.180, Speaker B: I see investment versus reward in a chain or a game studio. Are your customers game studios?
00:44:01.260 - 00:44:01.792, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:44:01.926 - 00:44:06.992, Speaker B: Got it. And each game studio wants to deploy a game and different ones will want different chains.
00:44:07.056 - 00:44:07.670, Speaker F: Right.
00:44:08.360 - 00:44:16.470, Speaker B: Okay. So what is your role in this? Are you doing the deployment for them and building the game for them?
00:44:17.160 - 00:44:34.812, Speaker F: We're basically taking care of everything on the Web Three side. So the wallets, managing the wallets, all the on chain transactions so that they can focus on the game itself. And a lot of times it's decisions around what chain to use and what wallets to use, how to build that.
00:44:34.946 - 00:44:48.370, Speaker B: Right. So I'm guessing that you're trying to get the characteristics of what they're looking for in a game, sort of the cost constraints and then picking a chain based on that. What confounding factor is making the decision difficult?
00:44:49.300 - 00:45:14.056, Speaker F: Usually for the studio, or making the decision for the studio is easier for us. It's okay. Kind of how big is this game going to be? How many studios are looking down the same path at the same chains and what is the development cost for us? Like, are there things that we can integrate and pull off the shelf and.
00:45:14.078 - 00:45:15.288, Speaker A: It'S a quick build or things we.
00:45:15.294 - 00:45:16.356, Speaker F: Have to build from scratch?
00:45:16.468 - 00:46:26.144, Speaker B: I see. I think we're grappling with something similar right now because we could deploy a bunch of op chains for people who do we prioritize? Do we prioritize the Coinbases of the world or do we prioritize these seed stage folks where it's really difficult to evaluate whether or not it would be worth the investment because we are bandwidth constrained. I would ask yourself what you're optimizing for and make a targeted hypothesis and you want to construct the next sort of quarter of your product roadmap. So at the end of the quarter you have a definitive answer of yes or no, whether or not that was a good strategy and to have a clear way to debug what went wrong. We initially were like we're generalized, we do everything and then at the end of the quarter you look at the smattering of different directions that you've gone in and you cannot answer what went wrong. You're not able to debug. So ask yourself at the end of this quarter, which area of roadmap ambiguity do you want to clarify and then match everything to that prioritization function? Yeah.
00:46:26.182 - 00:46:28.080, Speaker F: And have a hypothesis and try to.
00:46:28.150 - 00:47:00.698, Speaker B: Chase after that hypothesis. Yeah. For example, your hypothesis could be multiplayer games. It's probably not the real game terminology. First person shooters are going to be the next wave of blockchain games. So we are going to focus on a bunch of different kinds of first person shooters. Our hypothesis for why they will be the next wave of onchain games is because reason and then show everyone the reason.
00:47:00.698 - 00:47:17.906, Speaker B: Does everyone vibe with this reason modify? If not and then you have your hypothesis and then all your experiments should be testable. This partnership is going to answer this question. This other partnership is going to answer this other question and frame it in a way that's falsifiable makes sense. Thanks.
00:47:18.008 - 00:47:54.400, Speaker G: Hey, thanks so much for talking. Lots of really great information you shared. I'm Ellie, I'm the CTO of Bello and one of the things I really liked that you talked about was squeezing the plan and not the people. And I think for myself, when I'm faced with a challenge, I'm the kind of person that just wants to spend 12 hours coding and figuring it out and just solve it right away. And that definitely leads to inevitable burnout for employees if it's not your passion. So I guess what are tips that you have for trying to optimize the plan better versus just trying to brute force more hours in the day because there's only ever going to be so many hours.
00:47:57.010 - 00:48:29.254, Speaker B: Josh Stein, this ex prosecutor like graybeard type person I was telling you guys about that we hired. I was having a really hard time turning down calendar requests at first because I felt uncomfortable saying no to things and I'd rather just work more hours. And I was telling him about this, and I was like, you know, I'm trying to be respectful. And he's like, no you're not, kid. You're being fucking selfish. And I was like, what? How can you say that I'm being selfish? I'm being a great leader. I'm putting in all this time.
00:48:29.254 - 00:49:13.606, Speaker B: I'm killing myself for the mission. He's like, no you're not. You're being fucking selfish. You are taking a company resource, your time, energy and bandwidth, and you're spending it on alleviating your own anxiety because you're too big of a wimp to set that fucking anxiety aside. Upset some people, deal with them not liking you and put it on the actual thing the company needs, which is the fucking plan. That is almost verbatim what he said to me, and I say that to you. So why are you having trouble allocating the hours towards the strategy? Is it because you don't know what to do and there's ambiguity and it's easier to go take care of fires? Because what you have to do is very clear.
00:49:13.606 - 00:49:29.034, Speaker B: Is it because you feel anxiety around delegating? Just ask yourself why and then deal with the reason and then focus your energy on the plan. Yeah, I love that.
00:49:29.072 - 00:49:29.946, Speaker G: Thank you.
00:49:30.128 - 00:49:58.760, Speaker H: Hi, Jane, thanks for the talk. I'm locha from fuel. We're building an affiliate marketing protocol. And I wanted to ask you about the early days of building the ecosystem in terms of convincing or onboarding the first builders to come and build on top of optimism. How was that? And then if you could also touch a little bit on the public goods retroactive program and how that also helps fuel that.
00:50:00.170 - 00:50:06.360, Speaker B: I would say that we're still in the early days of building the ecosystem. At least it feels like that to me.
00:50:08.730 - 00:50:12.266, Speaker H: In the first few three projects that.
00:50:12.288 - 00:50:53.666, Speaker B: Decided to build yeah, I think we had the advantage of being really early. There weren't that many people working on crypto scaling at the time that we started, so we had built up a bit of a reputation over time. Already there were maybe like five ethereum researchers working on scaling, and Carl was one of them. There were, know, two people thinking about bitcoin scaling. So it was just a really small community at the time. And so there was the gift of that early reputation. So I don't know, that my answer there is that, like, people just knew who we were because we had published articles.
00:50:53.666 - 00:51:25.598, Speaker B: We had set a lot of the standards for how scaling systems should be designed. The term optimistic roll up comes from us. The UX of instant transactions come from us. The first ever plasma production plasma design comes from us. So that had already been established. And by the time we raised, people already knew who we were, were looking forward to the product and it was pretty easy getting the first set of builders. What wasn't easy was disappointing the first set of builders.
00:51:25.598 - 00:51:53.658, Speaker B: That was fucking rough. Since then we've had to do things that aren't in our DNA BD, devrel marketing. We had no idea how to do any of these things and it was just like about hiring the right people. Our first ever BD person was hire number 40. Yeah. So I don't know what problems you guys face right now though.
00:51:53.824 - 00:52:12.410, Speaker H: So we're trying to allow crypto projects to partner with creators or publishers in a trustless way. So we allow them to create campaigns, stake budgets on our smart contract and then we handle all the attribution and the payouts to these referrals or creators on chain.
00:52:12.490 - 00:52:14.238, Speaker B: Do you have customers currently or are.
00:52:14.244 - 00:52:18.100, Speaker H: You still in the launch yet and we're now trying to break that zero?
00:52:18.950 - 00:53:14.786, Speaker B: Yeah, I would give similar advice I gave earlier, which is like, make a hypothesis on who you think you provide the most value to, like who are you solving a problem for and then go and find that person. Where are you going to find that person? Are you going to find it in Dow communities where people are already familiar with NFTs? If so, go to the Dow forums, ask a 16 Z for introductions to the persona that you believe to be your first user. Then pitch them, make a deck just as you would pitch a VC. Show them your product, outline your value prop, ask them about their problems. And you will learn a ton after the first few conversations. And you're not going to get it right the first few times, but you keep on having these conversations and then eventually you'll solve a problem for someone and you'll solve it really well. And they're going to fucking love you and they're going to tell their friends and slowly, onward and upward.
00:53:14.978 - 00:53:15.478, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:53:15.564 - 00:53:16.440, Speaker H: Thank you.
00:53:16.810 - 00:53:30.620, Speaker I: So quick question is what's the mode for autism? Early on, like around six stage? Are you all in person? Distributed? Do you have any learning from that? That's the first question.
00:53:32.830 - 00:53:35.322, Speaker B: Sorry, what's the mode like a working.
00:53:35.376 - 00:53:40.942, Speaker I: Mode, is it in person or distributed? And a sharing between the company cultures in general.
00:53:41.076 - 00:54:32.746, Speaker B: So we raised our seed round a couple months before the pandemic hit and I rented one big apartment in New York City and six of us, the entire founding team, lived in that apartment. One guy lived on the roof in a tent and he came in during the winter because it got cold in New York. But we all lived and worked in one apartment. That was chaos but amazing. Like an incredible experience. We learned how to communicate. The failure of that model was that when we started hiring more, we hadn't developed any of the good habits that a good remote culture requires like documentation, writing things down, like clear communication and slack.
00:54:32.746 - 00:55:11.014, Speaker B: It was really hard to have the hybrid model, but I will say Pandemic was a whole nother beast. I remember six of us, our fridge broke and Amazon Prime was not like the delivery was not functioning and grocery stores were closed. But forward thinking me, I had ordered 260 cans of Chef Boyardi ravioli right as the news of the Pandemic hit. And so that for a couple of days. Cool.
00:55:11.132 - 00:55:32.594, Speaker I: Thanks for sharing the story. The follow up question you mentioned about getting introduction to the big companies engine manager. When would you start to pull them out of the big company? How would you convince them to join the fast paced startup compared to the safe environment for the big company?
00:55:32.712 - 00:55:35.118, Speaker B: Yeah. What were you doing before a startup?
00:55:35.214 - 00:55:36.318, Speaker I: Airbnb.
00:55:36.494 - 00:55:38.420, Speaker B: Why did you come out of big company?
00:55:38.790 - 00:55:40.110, Speaker I: I got bored.
00:55:40.270 - 00:55:43.250, Speaker B: Great. Do you know anyone at Airbnb who's bored?
00:55:44.070 - 00:55:53.602, Speaker I: I do. A lot of them bored, but because of current recession, most people feel like they just want to rest and rest at a safer investment environment.
00:55:53.666 - 00:57:12.114, Speaker B: Perfect. If they're resting, investing, then they're not doing any fucking work. Give them a little advisory grant and ask them to do something for your startup. The contributions that they make as an advisor contribute to the likelihood of you shipping your product, raising money, and then reaching a point of stability where you can pluck them out of Airbnb. And for the people who are genuinely resting investing, how much equity do they need? Are they really that good? Is everybody who's bored looking for stability? Or is it precisely the people who are bored that are trying to take a risk? And if you're finding high ranking, ranking, whatever title engineering people at a company like Airbnb, they can definitely find another job if your startup doesn't work out. So if they're willing to take that risk, that's a solid ass homie. And so you can either do the advisory structure with somebody and you really get a good view into whether or not you would work well with them, and otherwise go find the people who are down to take a risk and give them an equity comp package that makes it worth it.
00:57:12.114 - 00:57:45.546, Speaker B: And I would always rather pay really handsomely and expect really high performance, because the worst is when you've asked someone to make a big change or they're an expensive hire and they're doing okay, and you've been kind of NIT picky about the kind of stingy about the comp, so you don't really know if it's worth firing them or not. Pay really handsomely and keep your expectations there. And if someone is delivering a mediocre job, it is very obvious that it is far too expensive to keep them on the team.
00:57:45.728 - 00:57:46.314, Speaker I: Got it.
00:57:46.352 - 00:57:47.194, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:57:47.392 - 00:57:54.680, Speaker A: Great. Well, I learned a lot. Thank you so much. Shang. I thought that was fantastic. All right.
