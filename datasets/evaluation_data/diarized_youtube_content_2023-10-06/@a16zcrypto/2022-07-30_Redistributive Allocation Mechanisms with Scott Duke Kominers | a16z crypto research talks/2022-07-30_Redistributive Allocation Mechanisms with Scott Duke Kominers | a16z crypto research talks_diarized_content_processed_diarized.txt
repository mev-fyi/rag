00:00:06.750 - 00:00:07.300, Speaker A: You.
00:00:09.350 - 00:00:36.198, Speaker B: So let's get started. One, thanks for coming. Last, a 16 research crypto research seminar of the week. We've got our very own Scott Commoners, who will be telling us about redistributed allocation mechanisms. Before he gets started, let me just mention that Mohammed Akbarpor, who's his frisk co author, he'll actually be visiting us, I believe it's the week after next, so he'll be hanging out here. So that's another thing to look forward to. So, Scott, all yours.
00:00:36.374 - 00:00:57.290, Speaker A: Excellent. Thanks so much. Thrilled to be back here presenting a second time this week. Very different format of talk. No audio at the beginning or anything. This is a formal research talk, but as with the other, I love participation and comments and questions and stuff, so feel free to just ask questions or shout them out. Raise your hand typing in the chat.
00:00:57.290 - 00:01:55.490, Speaker A: I'll be monitoring all of these things at once and economists are very used to having lots of questions during their talk, so please do discuss. And then let me also shout out Mohammed Akbarpur, who Tim just mentioned is going to be visiting the group and Pierre Dwarzak. These guys are both totally extraordinary. And while our names are in certified random order in some Shapley value sense, you should apportion more than two thirds of the credit for this agenda to the two of them because it could never have happened without either of them, but it could have happened without me. So if you take the marginal contributions of all the subcoalitions, like when you compute the Shapley value, more of the density falls on their subcoalitions in any event. So this is a paper that I started writing, gosh, four, maybe years ago, like a long, long time ago, especially relative to typical timelines in CS. And it didn't start as a crypto paper.
00:01:55.490 - 00:02:31.150, Speaker A: In fact, it was a time when I wasn't aware of a lot of sort of the modern consumer crypto applications that I study these days. But as we'll talk about sort of throughout and especially at the end, it actually turns out to be like highly germane for a couple of crypto applications. The starting observation is that many goods and services are allocated using non market mechanisms, even though monetary transfers are available. So we frequently do non market allocation. This comes up in housing markets and health care, food. Think about in kind food transfers, like food stamps. Commercial applications include event tickets.
00:02:31.150 - 00:03:35.940, Speaker A: I guess park permits are not exactly a commercial application. They're sort of more commercial than those other three because they're definitely not essential goods in some sense, unlike housing, health care and food. But like event tickets, we see artists selling tickets to concerts at much lower than what would be market clearing prices. And we all just saw this play out worldwide with vaccines as well. So despite the fact that some people would have had exceedingly high willingness to pay to get vaccinated early against COVID-19, in practice the US and virtually every other country in the world used some sort of priority system where they sort of allocated early vaccines to healthcare workers, other sorts of frontline workers, like people in grocery stores and also people who are at especially high risk of the elderly, immunocompromised and so forth. And that's despite the fact that you could in principle have used a market allocation and some people would have had very very high willingness to pay. So these are all contexts where we see non market mechanisms being used.
00:03:35.940 - 00:04:51.206, Speaker A: This also crops up in our crypto world. We see it frequently with NFTs where assets are sold typically at far below market clearing prices sometimes via constrained sale mechanisms, via waitlist and sometimes just in public sales at below market clearing prices. And we see gas wars and other sorts of competition to gain access as a result. And this last bullet point is a little bit more speculative because I don't know of an example of it although we had talked about doing such a thing in Diem. You could imagine that if you have a semi permissioned network you actually care a lot about say the geographic distribution of your validators right for some sort of physical robustness to different forms of disaster or attack. And so you might in fact be willing to offer more attractive terms to someone who's willing to run a node in a location that would otherwise not be part of your system or inside of a nonprofit institution or something of the sort. And so once again you could imagine a situation where the organizer of the market would prefer to use a non market allocation to do distribution or at least a partially non market allocation.
00:04:51.206 - 00:06:07.518, Speaker A: You might have different market clearing prices depending on some of the characteristics of the participants or you might just sort of sell units at different prices depending on an early sale, a late sale with different probabilities of getting the good. But so looking at this as an economist we're sort of left scratching our heads, right? Like these are all high value goods or at least some NFTs are high value goods. Why not use a market mechanism which at least in principle should lead to more efficient outcomes at least as measured by people's willingness to pay? And one answer that we see often and that we see in all of these contexts phrased slightly differently is redistributive concerns, right? We have inkind transfers of housing and health care and food because we think these are essential goods. And often people's low willingness to pay for them is not a signal of low demand but rather a signal of low ability to pay. We think it's important for them to have access even though they don't necessarily have the ability to pay for them. In the context of event tickets the highest willingness to pay agents again, it might be driven by ability to pay as well as value. And those might not be the ones that have the sort of greatest positive externalities for the concert.
00:06:07.518 - 00:06:41.120, Speaker A: So, for example, a friend of mine told me about an instance in which effectively an entire Pit Bull concert was filled with McKinsey consultants as a McKinsey event. And while, like McKinsey has a very high willingness to pay for Pit Bull tickets, this turned out to be like a pretty low energy Pit Bull concert because you fill an entire I think people are laughing. Zoom filters. Laughter but I think some people might be laughing. That's good. It turns out to be a pretty low energy Pit Bull concert. If you fill the room full of McKinsey consultants, you don't have any.
00:06:41.120 - 00:06:56.500, Speaker A: Well, we won't characterize why perhaps this sort of wasn't optimal, but artists often try and keep prices low as a way of getting sort of their true high energy fans into the room. Quick question, please.
00:06:57.270 - 00:07:07.766, Speaker C: So can you clarify what you mean by non market? What's the difference between free market market with quotas and tariffs versus non market?
00:07:07.948 - 00:07:59.446, Speaker A: Yeah, so we'll make this very precise in a few slides, but in this context, we're going to be talking about pricing that sort of doesn't result in assortative matching on willingness to pay. So some sort of price constraint with rationing or randomization. We often in these contexts also see sort of totally unpriced allocation, right? So you might allocate like event tickets by sort of a full lottery at price zero or something. That's sort of a special case of the price zero. We're going to have transfers that sort of like fixing the price at zero. But we're not talking about very complex zero priced prioritization schemes like you might see in the context of a two sided or of a matching based sort of allocation without money model. But there again, I think the core intuition is the same.
00:07:59.446 - 00:08:20.862, Speaker A: The decision about do you want to use a non market mechanism comes from some redistributive preference. You care a lot about the types of people who receive the good. And here we're going to be thinking about doing that redistribution through a pricing system, potentially with rationing, but you can also do that via various forms of direct priority scheme. Does that help?
00:08:20.996 - 00:08:21.774, Speaker C: Yes.
00:08:21.972 - 00:09:13.722, Speaker A: Awesome. Further questions? All right, so the model today is actually going to be a one sided model because it's going to make the dynamics we're talking about clearer. But let me just quickly present some intuition that, at least for me, is really helpful in thinking about what's going on. And we have another paper called Redistribution Through Markets which matches this supply demand curve. I'm about to show you a little bit better, and with apologies, I'm like going back to Econ 101, but this is a little wacky. I'm going to show you an Econ 101 picture and point out something that has always been in this picture, but I myself had never noticed until I started working on this agenda with Mohammed and Pyotr, but is sort of like very essential in how we think about the use of market clearing mechanisms. So here's a classic supply and demand curve.
00:09:13.722 - 00:09:33.954, Speaker A: I am terrible at pictures, this is true. So I have to remind myself what the heck it says. So supply curve slopes up, demand curve slopes down. Good. You can think about every point on the supply curve. It's representing an agent, right? So this is somebody whose value, opportunity, cost or cost of selling is that point. And up here it's a higher cost.
00:09:33.954 - 00:09:57.950, Speaker A: We've got somebody else who has a higher cost of selling buyers. Similarly up here, this is someone who values the good at this number. This is somebody who values the good at this number. And why do we pick the market clearing price? Well, it maximizes the area of this triangle, right, if we push the price above market clearing. Instead we introduce two inefficiencies. One of them is this triangle here. It's called the dead weight loss triangle.
00:09:57.950 - 00:10:33.686, Speaker A: These are trades that the market would bear, but that don't happen. Right? Here's a person with willingness to pay above that seller's cost of selling and we don't have them trade because the price is too high. The second inefficiency, which isn't sort of as visually clean, is this dashed line. There's more people who want to sell at this price than want to buy and so we have to do some rationing. We don't necessarily pick the most efficient sellers. So those are the two allocative distortions. The nice thing about market clearing pricing sorry, is it saves us from both of those distortions, right? We get rid of the David loss triangle and supply and demand clear perfectly.
00:10:33.686 - 00:12:00.420, Speaker A: So we don't have to do any rationing. But note also in this picture is that blue box, right? So there's also a transfer from buyer surplus to seller surplus, right? Here it's red, here it's blue. And if for some reason we thought that the people in our market, the sellers in our market were high social welfare value relative to buyers, if we cared about getting money to the sellers enough, we might be happy with this allocative distortion in exchange for an improvement in equity, right? An improve for the transfer value of the market and getting some value from the buyers who buy to the sellers who sell. And again, as I say, we're going to be talking about one sided markets today. But this is the core idea that somehow we're going to be more okay with market distortions that distort away from allocative efficiency when they serve a really strong welfare purpose. But of course, if we just knew precisely who we were trying to target and could target them, then we don't need to use market forces quite as much to figure out who we want to target. But some information, especially think how the more anonymous your participants are, the less information you have about them, the more you actually might need to use people's behavior as a way of screening their level of need.
00:12:00.420 - 00:12:42.814, Speaker A: And even if you do know who they are, their behavior might screen some levels. Can I identify some levels of need that you might not be able to observe particularly easily? So think back to the start of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic became much more dangerous to drive for rideshare companies in some abstract, hard to understand way, right? Like respiratory pandemic. Clearly having a bunch of people coming in out of your car is a dangerous thing to do. We don't quite know how dangerous. But rideshare got more dangerous more or less overnight and yet a bunch of people started driving for rideshare for the very first time. And the way to think about what was going on there is presumably not that these people were risk seeking.
00:12:42.814 - 00:13:35.380, Speaker A: It like hoping to catch COVID as early as possible, but rather that Rideshare is a market with free entry and at that precise moment, they had an Idiosyncratic cash need. That meant being able to enter into this market was valuable to them. Right. And that might be that they were just furloughed from their job or they had a family member who got ill, so they needed extra cash on the short run. And so in that sense, rideshare markets at the start of the pandemic especially, were selecting for sellers through their behavior who were higher need on average. And so distorting the price sort of bumping. In that case, bumping up the price a little bit would effect a pretty high social welfare transfer from buyers to sellers, especially because buyers are pretty price and elastic, so the size of that dead weight loss triangle isn't actually that big.
00:13:35.380 - 00:14:11.120, Speaker A: And so through the market you could sort of identify agents where the transfer role of the market is actually sort of a powerful social welfare tool. And again, maybe some of those things the market sorry, the government or whoever the tax authority is, could eventually pick up, right? Eventually you know that someone's been furloughed from their job, but the market could sort of respond immediately in a way that a government allocation can't necessarily and then again, this like you have a sick family member thing is maybe information the market can learn about you that you can never sort of credibly communicate to a government.
00:14:12.130 - 00:14:25.166, Speaker B: Scott, I have a question. This sample you're distorting the price, right? Does the picture look different if you distort the quantity instead? If you say like only X transfers.
00:14:25.198 - 00:14:28.066, Speaker A: Can happen but the price can be freely set?
00:14:28.088 - 00:14:29.590, Speaker B: Or is it the same picture?
00:14:32.010 - 00:15:21.490, Speaker A: It's probably about the same picture, right? I guess it depends a little bit on the way in which the market adjusts following a change in quantity. But if you like, you know, fixing price so that this is the market clearing quantity and fixing the quantity to equal this market. Clearing quantity should lead to that being the market clearing price modulo like general equilibrium adjustment. So I think it's effectively the same there. We're going to see that in kind, redistribution is not always the most efficient way to redistribute. You might find that you actually want to raise a lot of revenue in the market and then just redistribute that as like a lump sum transfer. And so there are various types of distortions you might want and they don't all look like ones that could be implemented through sort of redistribution through the quantity lever.
00:15:21.490 - 00:15:54.858, Speaker A: But in this case I think they're basically equivalent. Further thoughts or questions? Great questions. All right, so what do we need to do today? So, as I mentioned, that two sided example is sort of for framing intuition. We have another paper that sort of like matches that a little bit more directly. It's called redistribution through markets. Today we're going to be looking at a one sided allocation framework with redistributive concerns. And importantly, as I've already hinted, we're going to be taking this market design perspective.
00:15:54.858 - 00:16:44.474, Speaker A: So this is not public finance. This is we control only a single market. We're either a regulator who oversees that market or we're just the market designer, we run the marketplace platform or something of the sort. And we're going to be allocating goods of heterogeneous quality, differing in observed and unobserved to agents, rather differing in observed and unobserved characteristics. And so we're going to have a curve of qualities which could also, I guess, be interpreted as like a probability of receiving the good. And the agents are going to sort of have some observable labels and then some unobserved characteristics both like an unobserved willingness to pay and an unobserved social welfare weight. We're going to solve the optimal mechanism design problem under incentive and individual rationality constraints.
00:16:44.474 - 00:17:45.714, Speaker A: And crucially, those welfare weights are going to enter into our objective function. So we are going to be doing optimal allocation with respect to what we can learn about the welfare weights because donors are unobserved. As you'll see, we're actually going to have to be drawing inferences from agents types and their behavior as to what those welfare weights actually are. And the main takeaway from the paper is a framework for thinking about when you want to use some degree of redistributive allocation versus not. And the key factors that drive this turn out to be the interaction between the social preferences as reflected in those welfare weights and the agents observable characteristics, the role of revenue generated by the mechanism. So, like how much you care about revenue versus improving welfare through the mechanism directly. So, for example, if you can make really efficient lump sum transfers, right, if there's some set of agents I really, really care about, but I can raise money from the mechanism and then buy them some really useful public good.
00:17:45.714 - 00:18:33.410, Speaker A: Then maybe I still don't want to do redistributive allocation because I want to raise as much money as possible and then use that revenue to improve welfare. And then last it'll turn out a little bit to depend on sort of properties of the good itself. So it only makes sense to use a good for in kind transfers when that good is sort of universally desirable. This is like if I have, I don't know, got to be really careful what's a good that's not universally desirable. Pick your favorite really ugly sweater. It doesn't make sense to give people in kind transfers of super ugly sweaters because that may not actually be valuable to them in a way that causes us to be able to sort of shift welfare by lowering price. But that's a different story.
00:18:33.410 - 00:19:23.582, Speaker A: We'll talk about it a little bit later. I have a question that's where we're going. Yes, the heterogeneous quality, does that mean that different people care about different items like different amounts or that everybody agrees that each item is like what its value is at? Everyone is going to have a personal, like an individual specific willingness to pay for quality, but the quality levels are agreed upon by everybody. So there might be like a good health care program, like a really sort of strong health care system and a medium health care system and a weaker health care system. You might have a different shadow value of healthcare quality, but everyone agrees that the really good one is really good. Everyone agrees the medium own is medium and they just put different weights on it. And indeed your willingness to pay is going to interact linearly.
00:19:23.582 - 00:20:30.358, Speaker A: That will actually be important for our machinery, although I think not important for the messages. Okay, not to belabor related literature too much, but let me just quickly flag first of all, there's a lot of it, but first of all, there's a sort of folk theorem in economic theory that every idea in economic theory is an echo of a classical result from the golden era of theory. And indeed this is true of this entire research agenda as well. Marty Weitzman had this beautiful paper back in the posed the idea that you might want to use rationing instead of market clearing pricing when you're concerned about equity in addition to efficiency. When you have some agents with less ability to pay fully market clearing pricing, competitive equilibrium might not be welfare maximizing. This is, as I mentioned, also the sort of the tune we pick up in our in our other paper, redistribution through markets and then sort of methodologically. What we're talking about today sort of under the hood is building a lot on really leaning heavily on these ideas by Condorelli from 2013.
00:20:30.358 - 00:21:20.200, Speaker A: And then the story around why we want in kind transfers in this context is sort of going to be very like a mechanism design flavor of a story that we see in public finance as well, that basically sometimes we can screen people. They call it self targeting. It's also called that in the economic development literature. Sometimes we can use people's behavior to screen how much welfare we put on them in a market. Oh, and then footnote this. Also, like, we're going to see mechanisms that look very similar to what you see in frameworks with budget constrained bidders. Slightly different reason, but there's a sense in which there's a relationship because these budget constraints are sort of like an infinite shadow value on cash past a certain point.
00:21:20.200 - 00:22:04.182, Speaker A: All right, so that further ado. Let's set up a model. We are going to be allocating a unit mass of objects to a unit mass of agents. As I mentioned, each object can have a quality, and this was a precise answer to your question. So equalities are just this sort of distribution of qualities and agent types comprise a label, a willingness to pay for quality and an unobserved social welfare weight. So the designer knows the type distribution, but crucially does not observe the social welfare weights for the individual agents. And note that if an agent of type IR lambda receives a good with quality Q and pays T, then her utility is going to be QR minus T.
00:22:04.182 - 00:22:23.642, Speaker A: So that's how quality interacts with willingness to pay. So you have like a linear fixed willingness to pay for quality. And your contribution to social welfare is that value but multiplied by lambda. Everyone okay, so Scott, could you talk.
00:22:23.696 - 00:22:30.480, Speaker B: About it looks like I should not think of T as a transfer in the traditional sense, is that right?
00:22:31.570 - 00:22:49.070, Speaker A: No, T is a transfer in the traditional sense. We just have a welfare function that has weighted utility by lambda, but T is part of your utility. So you receive a transfer in your quasi linear utility function, but the social planner puts shadow value of that transfer lambda.
00:22:49.230 - 00:22:55.480, Speaker B: Okay. Transfers I guess, need not cancel out in the overall calculation because of the.
00:22:56.570 - 00:23:39.700, Speaker A: We are going to require full budget balance. So the transfers in T are going to cancel out. But indeed, as what you're saying, sort of the net value of a transfer can be positive, right? So I can take a dollar from somebody super wealthy and give it to somebody who's very impoverished and that has a net positive return to social welfare, whereas like, under a normal model, it would be neutral. I'm not sure I completely understand why utility is like Q times R when you're not paying anything. It's Q times R when you're not paying anything. Oh, well, it's if you receive a good of quality Q and pay T. So if you receive the good for free of quality Q, then you get Q times R and pay zero.
00:23:39.700 - 00:24:06.042, Speaker A: But in general, the allocation is going to involve you paying something for the good of quality Q. It's not that your value is QR always it's like you've got the object of quality Q and your willingness to pay for quality is R. Okay, note by the way, that you can implement people not getting the good just by having some objects of quality. Actually zero. Right? This is a closed interval. Yeah, I just think of R as like an amount to pay per quality. Per unit quality.
00:24:06.042 - 00:24:32.174, Speaker A: Exactly. It's a willingness to pay per unit quality. And as I say, I don't actually think any of the core qualitative dynamics I'm talking about are going to change if you instead they made that concave but they would just sort of get compressed. And machinery wise, it's actually like we're leaning on the linearity to be able to sharply characterize the optical mechanism. Cool. All right. And then again, quick reminder I is the observable.
00:24:32.174 - 00:24:55.310, Speaker A: So this might be like the neighborhood you live in or like your holdings of a certain NFT. It's like whatever we can expect, it might be your income. If we're the government, it's whatever we can observe and verify about you. Unobserved willingness to pay is like your sort of individual private value for quality. And then lambda again is the thing that actually affects the welfare function. But we can't observe it directly. So we have to infer it from INR.
00:24:55.310 - 00:25:26.070, Speaker A: So we have access to arbitrary direct allocation mechanisms. We insist on sort of pardon the lots of notation. I figure it's good for the video to actually give the formalism. But these are all the standard constraints as you expect them. Feasibility, we have to allocate the qualities we have. Incentive compatibility, we have to elicit values, truthfully, IR, we can't make people worse off by putting them in the mechanism and non negative transfers. So we're going to sort of insist that we not run a deficit.
00:25:26.070 - 00:26:42.110, Speaker A: One interesting footnote here, because lambda influences the sorry, objective, the designer is going to maximize a weighted sum of revenue and utility. So alpha times the sort of net transfer plus lambda times sort of dotted with this utility vector across all the different agents. One important note is because lambda affects the designer's utility but not the individuals. If we tried to elicit lambda directly, people would just tell us what we wanted to hear, right? If we asked them like, are you the person who's high sort of social welfare weight? They would say, of course I am, obviously if in fact we were going to use that in the mechanism. So essentially we're limited to eliciting R and imputing lambda under incentive compatibility. And so indeed, without loss of optimality, we can make the allocation and transfers depend only on R and I, but not on lambda directly. And so instead of just directly eliciting lambda and plugging into the welfare function, because again, people will tell us whatever lambda they think we actually want to hear, because that'll get you because it gets them a better outcome and doesn't affect their utility.
00:26:42.110 - 00:27:12.710, Speaker A: The designer is going to have to work with the expected social welfare weight given I and R. So economically, what we're really doing is we're estimating the need of agents, given what we can see about them and what we can elicit about them. And so the optimal mechanism is going to declare and really the optimal allocation is going to depend on the degree of correlation between the labels and the willingness to pay with the unobserved welfare rates. Go for it.
00:27:12.780 - 00:27:17.706, Speaker B: So what if the lambdas were just known? Would this just be like a straightforward problem?
00:27:17.888 - 00:28:21.518, Speaker A: Sorry? If the labels were just what the lambdas were, public the lambdas yeah, we still might ask how do we do the allocation given the lambdas? And there's I guess a greedy algorithm or something you would use to do it, but it definitely gets easier. So for example, like lambda equal to I, right? So if every I perfectly identified your lambda then we'd still be deciding within group. In fact actually how far am I from let me explain this slide and then I'll answer your question because I want to reference the thing here. So the way we find the optimal mechanism, which I'm not going to belabor in the talk today, but the details are cool and as I mentioned, major shoutouts to Condorelli for a lot of the machinery. But there's sort of two steps. So there's like an allocation across and within groups. The across group allocation is basically going to be a greedy algorithm conditioning on what the within group allocation is.
00:28:21.518 - 00:29:15.898, Speaker A: And the greedy algorithm is sort of going to be like allocating each marginal unit of quality to where it has the highest sort of expected social return. And then the within group is going to be sort of optimal allocation given that label. And we might find whether we want to sort people unwillingness to pay, we might find that we want to do fully random allocation. We might find we want to do something in the middle, but it's whatever is sort of like welfare optimal within that group. If the lambdas were sort of completely known from the group allocation, that actually gets very easy, right? It turns out that a lot of the allocation questions depend on the average social welfare weight. We'd still be doing a version of this type of allocation, right? Like it's possible that we might have really high lambdas within a group, but some agents with really low value for the good. And so we might still give some units to one lambda and then some units to another lambda and go back and forth.
00:29:15.898 - 00:29:26.660, Speaker A: But it's true, we'd have much less than we need to actually elicit, right? We could sort of sort everybody by lambda and then just decide sort of cut offs in each group for each pricing scheme or something like that.
00:29:28.550 - 00:29:30.646, Speaker C: Could you go back, just pause on.
00:29:30.668 - 00:29:34.806, Speaker A: The models, the previous slide, this one or. Two back.
00:29:34.908 - 00:29:44.038, Speaker C: This one. I think I missed this on the very first slide. I refers to a single player or I is like a demographic.
00:29:44.214 - 00:29:49.418, Speaker A: I is a demographic. So an agent is an IR lambda. Sorry.
00:29:49.584 - 00:29:50.540, Speaker C: That's fine.
00:29:51.070 - 00:30:28.360, Speaker A: That's actually like kind of clunky notations I had not thought of previously. Although it has the advantage. You can say like IR lambda, like IR baboon for anybody who watched that old cartoon, but it's a crypto talk. I have to make at least one totally random reference. The I is actually like, your demographic type, and it could be a very rich demographic type. It could be your neighborhood, your income, your, like, I don't know, your employee, your profession. In the context of vaccine allocation, we think of this as encoding your profession, your general risk factor, your age, all of that stuff.
00:30:28.810 - 00:30:41.260, Speaker C: And then also just make sure. So for non negative transfers, that actually means you're not allowed to just say, like, high lambda people, you're going to get money from low lambda people.
00:30:42.430 - 00:31:22.760, Speaker A: No, this is a net transfer, so we can do some amount of that, but it's manifested through alpha here. Right. So we can raise money. So if alpha is like, higher the average lambda in some group or the average pareto weight in some group, we can sort of raise money through a transfer. And then alpha sort of reflects giving that to giving that away as like a public good or something like that. But this is stopping us from just like this, I guess. Plus the IR constraint are stopping us from just taking a ton of money from people and giving them nothing in return.
00:31:22.760 - 00:31:51.970, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. In some sense, not only are we tying our hands to only one market, like, we're only sort of designing a single market, we're also turning off just sort of like redistributive taxation power. To the extent that we're doing something redistributive with cash, it has to be cash earned through the mechanism by selling the good, which, again, in a lot of these contexts we're thinking about seems reasonable. Right. Like, the National Park Service doesn't have the ability to go and tax people randomly, nor does the typical NFT mint.
00:31:53.910 - 00:31:56.594, Speaker C: Then can you go one forward again?
00:31:56.792 - 00:31:57.998, Speaker A: One forward? Yep.
00:31:58.094 - 00:32:13.100, Speaker C: There may be two. Sorry, where you settled, how how are things possibly going to be allocated? So when you say allocate within group, group refers to just i?
00:32:13.710 - 00:32:14.874, Speaker A: Yeah. Right.
00:32:14.992 - 00:32:27.294, Speaker C: And then so when you say allocate within group, you just mean that space on R because that's correct. You can possibly use the size i.
00:32:27.492 - 00:32:31.040, Speaker A: Yes. Okay.
00:32:34.530 - 00:32:47.890, Speaker C: Sorry. This is not obvious that you can do these two separate, or is this like it's not obvious that you should be able to break it down like this, correct?
00:32:47.960 - 00:32:50.200, Speaker A: Yeah, this is not obvious.
00:32:54.250 - 00:33:00.520, Speaker B: Is it obvious that this is like, something you could do and the only remaining question is optimality or is it?
00:33:00.890 - 00:33:51.480, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, because for any distribution of qualities to a group you can solve the optimal allocation problem, right? It's some mixture of assortment of matching at some pricing and rationing. Right? So for any allocation of qualities to groups, I can tell you the optimal way to distribute those qualities within each group. And so then it turns out that that sort of gives rise to this sort of expected social return of giving the marginal unit to a given group. Because, you know, for each unit, if you think about us like peeling off the quality distribution, we know from, I don't know, more or less like simpler mechanism design, like who's going to get that unit if we give it to each group. And so we know the expected social return of giving it to each given group. And so we can just now greedily allocate on the basis of that.
00:33:52.170 - 00:34:06.526, Speaker C: Sorry. Okay, so maybe something maybe obvious is too strong of a word, but you can say whatever allocation you eventually use, just project it onto each group. Whatever you do, project it onto each group. Better be optimal within that group.
00:34:06.708 - 00:34:07.534, Speaker A: Correct.
00:34:07.732 - 00:34:14.350, Speaker C: And so now since that has more structure, just write that down and optimize over that directly.
00:34:17.190 - 00:35:31.930, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a nice way of framing it actually. Indeed, there's this sort of like dual question of could you do it sort of in reverse, like basically price the qualities sort of per label or something? But indeed you basically end up doing this again, just sort of some inverted coordinate space because you have to keep track of a different available price for each label as you move through the quality distribution. Cool. All right. But so the really important question is actually sort of like what does the shape of the mechanism look like? The fact that the optimal mechanism has this really simple structure means we can actually ask of the solution sort of when you want to use in kind versus market allocation. So when do you use in kind redistribution? Which will mean in this context, random allocation at some range of a same range of quality levels at a below market clearing price. And the answer is going to be you roughly want to do this when you have some way of uncovering inequality in the unobserved welfare weights.
00:35:31.930 - 00:36:19.520, Speaker A: And there are two ways that this can happen. One of them is what we call label revealed inequality. So this is when you just know that in a given group you actually want to sort of transfer more utility to everyone in that group. So when the average pareto weight on group I that's that average expected lambda exceeds the weight on revenue, it's optimal to do at least some in kind redistribution to that group. For the case of universally desirable goods, these are goods for which even the lowest type wants. The good special case of that is essential goods. So like food stamps or public housing here you have some eligible group and it makes sense to do in kind redistribution because we care about sort of transferring value to that group.
00:36:19.520 - 00:37:25.540, Speaker A: I'll show you the formal statement about that in a second. But it's not so much in this context about giving them the good, giving them a utility by way of giving them the good, but by doing like pooling some units of the good at the bottom, we can actually lower price to the entire group. The second reason you might want to do in kind redistribution is when there's what we call willingness to pay revealed inequalities this is when the welfare weights are strongly and negatively correlated with willingness to pay. So think here health care, this is like, you know that someone is only willing to pay sort of $500 for some super important medical treatment. The inference there is not that they don't want the super important medical treatment, but they probably have very little ability to pay for it. So low willingness to pay for essential health care leads us to infer that you actually probably have high social welfare rate, you're probably sort of impoverished or otherwise in high need. And so there again, we might want in kind redistribution because it's a way of transferring to those agents who we infer through their behavior are actually high.
00:37:25.540 - 00:37:28.366, Speaker A: Scott I mean, wouldn't that be vulnerable.
00:37:28.398 - 00:37:31.694, Speaker B: To manipulation though, because anybody can manipulate.
00:37:31.742 - 00:37:33.378, Speaker C: Their willingness to pay down as you.
00:37:33.384 - 00:37:35.000, Speaker B: Know that this is what you're doing.
00:37:35.850 - 00:38:01.386, Speaker A: Yeah. So it has to be done in a way that is incentive compatible, which is actually very important. Right. So we're pooling some quality levels. So you're going to get lower quality at this lower price, but the pooling and the pricing has to work out precisely so that really high types don't want to mimic the low type. Yes, exactly. And this is in fact a problem with lots of public housing programs.
00:38:01.386 - 00:38:58.260, Speaker A: So there are a lot of places like Amsterdam, for example, where the public housing has historically been so good that even the very wealthy people would like to have it if they can. And so as a result, you end up with sort of the wrong people claiming the transfer. And so indeed you actually within group are going to get sort of these willingness to pay revealed inequality. People are going to get access to higher quality goods than they would get at the market clearing price, but lower quality than others for incentive concern reasons or lower expected quality because it's random allocation. Okay, so just formally, what does this look like? So label revealed inequality. As I mentioned, the average per weighter weight on a group is strictly larger than the weight on revenue alpha and the good is universally desirable. So lowest type place has positive willingness to pay.
00:38:58.260 - 00:39:46.990, Speaker A: Then there's some cut off so that we want a random allocation at a price of zero for all types. Below that cut off. Now, one intuition for this could be that we're just like giving sort of those agents welfare by giving them stuff for free. But that's actually not what's going on here, what's really driving this. Because remember, in this group we want everybody to do better, right? This is the average parade of weight for the entire group. We care about giving welfare to everyone rather than just the people with low willingness to pay here it's that a random allocation for free lets us lower prices for everybody, right? By like pooling a bunch of prices sort of objects at a lower average quality at the bottom. We're sort of pricing at the average quality in that pool rather than the top on the margin.
00:39:46.990 - 00:40:42.660, Speaker A: And that means we can lower the price that everybody else faces sort of to the extent that we have an assortative allocation at the top. Meanwhile, there's this willingness to pay revealed inequality as well. This is the one where we care about the people with a really low willingness to pay in particular. And you can write out the exact condition it's going to look actually pretty familiar. Has a virtual value component in it just with these sort of compared to these sort of social welfare rates for the transfer assorted matching is going to turn out to be suboptimal if willingness to pay is strongly, negatively correlated with welfare rates. As I said. So the converse question is when do we want to use market mechanisms? So when instead do we want assorted matching at market clearing prices? And this sounds almost tautological, but let me then try and convince you in two bullet points it's actually not as tautological as it sounds.
00:40:42.660 - 00:41:09.546, Speaker A: Roughly, this wants to happen when the revenue and efficiency motives dominate versus redistributive concerns. When somehow we care more about alpha and or overall efficiency than redistribution. But the question is when does that happen? So there are two contexts. One of them is about revenue maximization. So this is just when alpha is high. And remember, this doesn't necessarily mean we're a for profit entity. It might mean that we just can do something really socially valuable with that alpha that's sort of effectively a transfer to everyone.
00:41:09.546 - 00:41:54.038, Speaker A: So if the weight on revenue is above the average pareto weight on some group, we want at least some assorted matching. And that's going to happen when your buyers are sort of low pareto weight in the first place. To think corporations or as I said, when lump sum transfers are feasible. Sorry, the other context is efficiency maximization. Again, this sounds almost tautological, but we can say something precise about what it means here, which is kind of interesting. When is efficiency maximization optimal in this framework? It's when the welfare weights do not correlate with willingness to pay. When we're not within a group, we're not inferring anything from people's willingness to pay that tells us about welfare.
00:41:54.038 - 00:42:39.014, Speaker A: So that's when there's either a small dispersion in welfare rates to begin with. So just like everyone in the group is equal or we have sort of uniform welfare rates over the population, but also it could be that there are large dispersion of welfare weights. So there's big differences in people's ability to pay or their income or their level of need, but it isn't correlated with willingness to pay. So I think this is like bottles of milk. If somebody's not willing to pay a dollar for a bottle of milk, our inference is typically not that they're super impoverished, but rather they just don't like milk. And so in many ordinary scale markets, even if we wanted to do redistributive allocation, we couldn't because we're not learning anything about the welfare weights from people's willingness to pay. Right.
00:42:39.014 - 00:42:50.090, Speaker A: We could subsidize milk for populations where we can see an observable if we want to subsidize them, but we can't sort of like do redistributive pricing within a group because the willingness to pay just tells us people's tastes.
00:42:51.810 - 00:43:03.920, Speaker C: You didn't include the case where there is very strong positive correlation between willingness to pay and the weight. Is that because that's obvious or that's because it's not true?
00:43:04.930 - 00:43:47.146, Speaker A: No, that one's straightforward. So if there's really strong positive correlation between welfare rates and willingness to pay, both of these push in the direction of it's good for revenue to do market pricing and it's good for welfare to do market pricing, you might yeah, up to the average parado weight. So that's within group you might still have some amount of sort of redistributive allocation across the group somehow. Cool. Okay, just the interest of time. This is the statement of the assortative matching at the top. Yeah, this is pretty close to that statement.
00:43:47.146 - 00:44:26.006, Speaker A: Basically, if the revenue maximization motive dominates for high enough types, then of course you want some amount of assorted matching. Same thing if the efficiency maximization motive dominates for high enough types. But then we've talked a lot now about the within group distribution. Let me quickly say something about the across distribution. So here's something that's a little bit that I would not have sort of like I was surprised about as we were working on. But mechanism design concerns actually make sort of totally clear expost. So let's imagine now that we have two groups and then group one we're doing assorted of matching and in group two we're doing fully random matching.
00:44:26.006 - 00:45:10.940, Speaker A: So there's one group that's like all market pricing and one group that's sort of like all in kind transfer. You can ask the question of which units do you want to send to which groups? And the answer is a little bit surprising. So like the natural conjecture and often what we do in practice is we send the lowest quality objects to the group that gets the inkind transfer. But in fact, from a mechanism design perspective, what you'd really like to do is ache more revenue out of group one. And the way to do that is to have higher dispersion in quality within that group. So you actually want to send like, middle quality objects as the inkind transfer and use the top and bottom quality objects sort of for the assortment of matching group.
00:45:11.390 - 00:45:25.230, Speaker C: Can I ask one quick question, please? I don't remember if I missed an assumption on lambda, but I think if I remember correctly, you said lambda also multiplies how much you suffer from payments.
00:45:26.370 - 00:45:29.022, Speaker A: How much the welfare metric suffers from your payment.
00:45:29.076 - 00:45:49.590, Speaker C: Much the welfare metric suffers from payments, yes. Is it possible that even when you're doing the assortative matching, you don't want to raise a lot of revenue because the welfare metric gets destroyed by people with super high lambda? Even though I care about adding revenue?
00:45:51.690 - 00:46:11.878, Speaker A: Yeah, probably. You may be limited in your ability to collect not that much welfare in assorted matching because the incentive constraint forces you to have a price gradient. That's kind of back to this case, I guess, right? It's like, how does your weight on revenue compare to your average pareto weight in a given group? Oh, I see. Okay.
00:46:11.984 - 00:46:21.550, Speaker C: There's actually a lot baked into that, which is that you would never be in a situation where that happened and you were doing the welfare maximizing matching.
00:46:22.290 - 00:46:23.038, Speaker A: Okay.
00:46:23.204 - 00:46:27.460, Speaker C: There's a lot that goes into that, aside from just the intuition you put at the bottom.
00:46:28.390 - 00:47:04.014, Speaker A: Correct. And indeed, and you might still have some degree of assorted matching at the top because all this result tells us is that we want some amount of random allocation at the bottom. The reason we want the random allocation at the bottom is precisely because it lets us lower prices to everybody while maintaining incentive compatibility. Got it. That's actually like a more precise it's a very nice it's a very precise intuition for why you actually use the random allocation to lower prices for everyone. Because you couldn't even if you wanted to lower prices to everyone at the top. You can't just do that because you lose the incentive constraint in the last couple of minutes.
00:47:04.014 - 00:47:39.394, Speaker A: I just want to say a little bit about policy. I'm going to talk about government policy for a second and then talk about NFT. Mint policy. So looking at the world with this sort of logic changes the way we think about a lot of sort of non market versus market allocation mechanisms. So an early case, another early pandemic example, something that happened in March 2020 was a bunch of people went to dollar stores, bought all the hand sanitizer, and then started selling it on Amazon and Ebay for 400 x markups. 40 to 400 x, I guess. Markups.
00:47:39.394 - 00:48:21.142, Speaker A: And this was sort of people were very upset. They referred to this as price gouging. Some of these people have since been prosecuted. But to an economist, at first blush, that sounds sort of strange. It's like, well, people's willingness to pay was very high if they were able to sell these things for $40 a bottle when they bought them for a dollar. That's markets working, isn't it? So in the frame of this paper, you can sort of realize that that's like a really regressive allocation, right? Like at the start of the pandemic, everyone thought they needed a lot of hand sanitizer and it started out pretty evenly distributed across the country. And if anything, buying it from dollar stores which are often in lower income areas and selling it to people with high ability to pay right.
00:48:21.142 - 00:49:29.514, Speaker A: Sort of willingness to pay of 40 with not $40 was not reflective necessarily. Of especially high demand relative to others. But just like a greater ability and access to pay large amounts for it on an Internet platform, and if anything, the need was probably greater in those low income communities where people were more often having to go in person to jobs, take public transit and so forth. And so this is like a really regressive reallocation of the goods. Meanwhile, food stamps, which are sort of people have criticized for sort of providing in kind transfers to individuals, actually, food stamps are really, really hard to get access to, right, and sort of really small benefit. And so there's a sense in which the process of going through and becoming gaining certification to receive food stamps is sort of almost its own means test. It's a little bit outside of this model, but it's like a queuing or some sort of very strong, active sort of work to gain access.
00:49:29.514 - 00:50:39.634, Speaker A: And it's like the people who show up and pay that cost to participate are signaling their need again through their behavior. And indeed, the shadow value of transferring some welfare to them or some surplus to them rather, is probably such high in welfare terms that we could actually make food stamps programs much larger. This also has bearing on how we think about sort of inequality on marketplace platforms. And then, as promised, this was shaped a lot by thinking about NFT mints and other sorts of community building processes in the crypto world. Indeed, it's shaped in so much that we're now working on a paper that uses a lot of the same machinery and logic here to try and understand precisely what I'm about to say in more detail. Also, by the way, that queuing thing so jointly with Shingwu Li, we're also trying to understand that. So when you have a world where some people have high value for money and other people have high value for time, you can use queuing as a way of screening the people with high value for the good, high value for money, but low value for time.
00:50:39.634 - 00:51:20.542, Speaker A: And so that now the cross correlation between the value for money and value for time becomes so, you know, a very, you know, sort of la is having their board and dangerous mint next week. This is extremely non random example, I'm very good friends with the people who run this project. We have a bunch of joint projects in progress and moreover they're an A 16 C portfolio company. So this is emphatically not a random example. It is also not investment advice. I'm only here to talk about their auction mechanism. So they're running a market clearing Dutch auction which is actually sort of like also pretty interesting.
00:51:20.542 - 00:52:25.214, Speaker A: They're beautiful and very sophisticated contract doing a full clearing price auction with automatic refunds. There's also some interesting stuff there, but like many projects they also have a whitelist, in this case the right list where they're selling the goods at a discount. And this is going to several different sets of individuals. These are people who own their original NFT collection, who were involved in the production of the book Bored and Dangerous or who've sort of engaged in puzzle and other competitions inside of their community showing effort and interest in engagement. And in fact there's actually sort of three phases. There's a public sale, the right list sale and then a free claim for a price zero for all of their original NFT series holders. And this setup, it's a little bit abstracted from the world of the model of course, but it's actually very much the same sort of idea, right? Like here we have different individuals, this is label Revealed Inequality.
00:52:25.214 - 00:53:17.846, Speaker A: We have individuals with different welfare weights that we place on having them sort of remain in the community and get access to the new good. Right? Like highest rank is the community of people who are the writers room and sort of contributed to writing the book. Next are people who are either actively engaged in the community or who are involved in licensing and sort of contributing intellectual property to the book. And then there's the public where we have sort of no ability to screen other than on price and you've got the prices exactly sort of structured in the way that the model would predict that you should. Under the optimal mechanism, you're essentially giving a discount to the agents that you have special welfare reasons to want to include and thus care about their welfare. Willingness to pay revealed Inequality actually does happen in these contexts as well. Although I've looked around I couldn't find a specific instance that had actually been used.
00:53:17.846 - 00:54:06.900, Speaker A: Although there are a number of projects that had talked about doing a mechanism that's actually very close to the middle type goods where they basically have a clearing price auction at the start. So there's like assorted of matching on price, clearing price or pay as bid descending auction at the start. So assorted of matching on price with probability of getting the good equal to one, then like a mint for their community at some reduced price and then an open mint at an even lower price of all the remaining objects. And so you have precisely the price gradient that would be sort of set out by that last example I showed you. You can mint with certainty at some clearing price. You can mint if you're in the group of active and engaged community members at some lower price. It's sort of like middle quality, if you will.
00:54:06.900 - 00:55:03.654, Speaker A: And then there's sort of a frenzy at the end at some low market clearing price where you sort of know you're getting rationed. All right, so that is our story for today. We've proposed a model of optimal allocation under general redistributive concerns. We've sort of saw that correlation between the welfare weights and the elicitable and observable information is what drives whether you want to do redistributive allocation. And it also matters very much how revenue used, sort of collected by the mechanism is used. Like, to what extent does revenue substitute for doing redistribution through this specific market? And again, and this is, I think, very general and extremely not limited to this particular market design context. The key dynamic is that we're using the observables and even more importantly, agents behavior, like what they reveal about their welfare weight from their behavior in the market.
00:55:03.654 - 00:55:37.318, Speaker A: Again, we scratch the surface and how this ties into crypto applications specifically. But I do think there's a real sense in which in markets where participants are mostly pseudonymous, this is a particularly important thing to be able to do. We really do actually want to be using all the information we can get from people's behavior to try and understand sort of what their contribution to social welfare, to our community, to an open source product, whatever it is, is worth. All right, QED, and happy to chat a little bit more with questions. Thanks so much, Scott.
00:55:37.354 - 00:55:56.280, Speaker B: Maybe just to connect the dots a little bit more, please, the mapping between your model and results in NFT min examples. So for the Jenkins example, was that a case where lambda in effect was known is even almost like defined by the design?
00:55:56.890 - 00:56:37.218, Speaker A: Lambda is mostly defined by the haven't they have an average? Maybe yes and maybe no. I think of them as thinking they know the average lambda, which is an assumption of the model, right, that we can compute lambda bar for each group. You don't know precisely who in your community of people who license intellectual property are the ones you're most excited about bringing into your Azerballa world, but you can infer that those are more likely on the margin to be people who have high social contribution. And so I think of them as knowing the averages, but not necessarily the individuals. Lambdas. That's actually precisely how we set it up in the model.
00:56:37.384 - 00:56:57.530, Speaker B: That makes sense. That makes sense. And then probably I'm just being like slow with a change of variable here, trying to connect, like what you said about the partitioning quality space into like three intervals versus sort of like some of the examples in the NFT mint where you have stages and reduced prices.
00:57:00.350 - 00:57:36.066, Speaker A: Yeah. So Q here I would think of in an NFT mint. So you could actually do it where you sell different qualities. Right, so I've seen a few projects proposed, but nobody actually do a process where if you mint earlier in the auction process, you have a higher probability of getting a rare or something of the sort. But what I'm thinking of is here, Q is more like your probability of being able to buy successfully or like maybe the number of units you have access to or something like that. In the case of Jenkins, Q is one you buy with certainty each time you buy in the auction. You also actually get to buy with certainty in that middle category.
00:57:36.066 - 00:57:43.450, Speaker A: But then if there were a cleanup step, that would be like you're buying with some probability below one because everyone's trying to buy at the same time.
00:57:43.600 - 00:58:07.646, Speaker B: Okay, this makes sense. Basically, stage two and stage three, both are kind of like over demanded, like many more people sort of like exactly right. So then the point is it's just going to be the third stage. It'll be a lower price, it'll be a larger population, it'll be a smaller probability of being a winner. So that's the excellent, excellent questions like.
00:58:07.668 - 00:59:01.650, Speaker A: Entertainments in these cases where contagious two and three have less quality, doesn't gas fees raise the price to what would be in stage one? Kind of mess things up a bit? Yeah, it's true. The very last minute changed a word in this slide to exactly avoid that concern. So the way you would really want to do this is a descending auction with a fixed price lottery at the end rather than a fixed price sale at an instant. I agree. So something that is totally outside of this model at the moment is anything resembling a gas fee. And we've seen repeatedly that probabilistic Mints with rationing at far below market clearing prices have found market clearing prices and gas fees instead. But I think you could do this in practice if you did it via a lottery that people just have like a long term sign up.
00:59:01.650 - 00:59:45.122, Speaker A: You sort of at the end of round two announce, okay, this is the number of units available, you have two days to sign our lottery list and then we're just going to draw the randomness for you. And indeed, just like generally good lottery etiquette for people who are good on chain lottery etiquette for people who are watching this, in the future you're going to probably want to cause people to escrow so that they can't create infinitely many lottery accounts and so that you know that you have the value in place to call in exchange for the mint. Awesome.
00:59:45.256 - 00:59:46.350, Speaker B: Thank you, Scott.
00:59:46.510 - 00:59:47.280, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
