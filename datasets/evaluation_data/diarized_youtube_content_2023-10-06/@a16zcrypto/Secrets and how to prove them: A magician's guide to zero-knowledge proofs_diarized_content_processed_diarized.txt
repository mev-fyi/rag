00:00:09.370 - 00:00:38.370, Speaker A: Zero Knowledge Proofs are a really important technology for blockchain scalability and privacy. And they open the door to new never before possible applications. But what are zero knowledge proofs? At a high level? A Zero Knowledge Proof is a way for me to cryptographically prove to you that I know some fact without revealing to you what that fact actually is. So they're technically complex. But let me try to explain using some magic. You see, when I perform a magic trick, I'm keeping a secret. It's like a subtle technique that I know and you don't.
00:00:38.370 - 00:00:57.200, Speaker A: My goal is to prove to you that I know this secret without revealing it to you, since that would ruin the trick. If the trick works, then you, as my spectator, can be sure that I know the secret method and hopefully you don't. In other words, a successful performance of a magic trick is a Zero Knowledge Proof. Let's try something.
00:01:00.450 - 00:01:37.526, Speaker B: As you can see, all the cards are different. What we're going to do is mix the cards face up into face down, just like this. So you can see that all the cards are facing different orientations. Now, I could go through the cards and turn them over one at a time, just like that. But I'm not going to do that. Instead, I have a better idea. You see, I know a secret method that allows me to instantly reorient the cards.
00:01:37.526 - 00:01:53.950, Speaker B: All I need to do is touch the center of the cards, just like this. And now the cards are going to reorient themselves. And you, as my spectator, can instantly verify that all the cards are in the correct orientation.
00:01:55.410 - 00:02:08.980, Speaker A: As you can see, zero Knowledge Proofs are literally magic. You.
