00:00:00.170 - 00:00:33.110, Speaker A: There's no idea that works on the first try. You have to put something out there and then grind it out like two or three years usually to sort of talk to your customers, improve the product, talk to your customers, improve the product. And sometimes it never works. And sometimes you break through after n number of years. And last thing I'll say and I'll turn it back to you is if you look at almost every successful startup, it it feels like it was an overnight success. But really that's just how history gets written in hindsight. If you talk to most of those founders in the early days, there was a period where any reasonable person would have quit.
00:00:33.110 - 00:00:58.700, Speaker A: Nothing was working. And all of them somehow persevered and pushed through and finally found some thing that started to get working. And then the next thing, and then the next thing. I guess I just made a decision at a certain point, and I said, you know what? I'm just going to go all out on this thing for the next two, three, four years. And if it doesn't work, it I will know that I left everything on the field and I will go back and figure it out. But I'm not going to quit before then. Close.
