00:00:10.350 - 00:00:10.900, Speaker A: You.
00:00:13.190 - 00:00:50.458, Speaker B: So thank you for having me. Thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time today. And we're going to talk a little bit about resilience and breath work. So first, let's go back, understand resilience, our ability to withstand and recover from adversity. Right. Resilience, ability to withstand and recover from adversity. So what if I told you there was something always available to you and something you do thousands of times per day, the breath to help you deal with that resilience, to help you deal with that adversity.
00:00:50.458 - 00:01:10.142, Speaker B: And so the beauty of breath work is it allows us to regulate our nervous system in order to put our state into a more calm and focused place. It will give us more energy, it'll help us to improve our mental acuity, it'll help our alertness.
00:01:10.286 - 00:01:11.986, Speaker C: So, for example, today we're going to.
00:01:12.008 - 00:01:57.780, Speaker B: Do some breath work that allows us to calm our mind and get us ready for intense focus that you will be doing for the next two, 3 hours while listening to our speakers. That's not the only thing breath work can do, and we're not going to go into all that today, but it does help your physical and mental health, your performance on a daily basis, and your longevity, something you'll be hearing about in a moment. So let's dive right in. What I would like to say is, in order to do this effectively while sitting up, we want to sort of give our diaphragm, our stomach some space, and we want to sit up tall, and we want to start thinking about deep inhales through our nose and long exhales out of the mouth. So it's going to sound something like this.
00:01:59.190 - 00:01:59.940, Speaker A: Ha.
00:02:03.210 - 00:02:23.450, Speaker B: Yes. Closing your eyes is excellent for that. We want to start finding that rhythm, that pattern of deep inhales through the nose, long exhales out of the mouth. And we use a lot of this breath work. As I was talking to some of you on the run this morning. Continue with that deep inhale. I'd like to hear your exhales.
00:02:26.510 - 00:02:27.260, Speaker A: Ha.
00:02:30.850 - 00:02:32.794, Speaker B: We're really trying to expand the lungs.
00:02:32.842 - 00:02:33.614, Speaker C: As we're doing this.
00:02:33.652 - 00:02:41.330, Speaker B: And we're starting to engage and activate the belly. We're going to do this for another 30 seconds.
00:02:42.870 - 00:02:43.620, Speaker A: Ha.
00:02:47.110 - 00:02:48.786, Speaker C: In through the nose, out through the.
00:02:48.808 - 00:02:49.490, Speaker B: Mouth.
00:02:52.570 - 00:02:54.470, Speaker C: Expanding the rib cage.
00:02:58.970 - 00:02:59.720, Speaker A: Ha.
00:03:01.050 - 00:03:17.770, Speaker B: Doing great. Just continuing to activate. You might want to pinch Your shoulders, SHoulder blades together behind you. Now LEt's InCREase the rhythm. We're really trying to expand the breath, expand the lungs.
00:03:19.870 - 00:03:20.620, Speaker A: Ha.
00:03:24.530 - 00:03:26.506, Speaker C: You want to feel a little Bit LIghtheaded.
00:03:26.538 - 00:03:27.818, Speaker B: That's completely normal.
00:03:27.914 - 00:03:31.730, Speaker C: Really trying to move SOme OxYGeN now. Really trying to activate.
00:03:35.110 - 00:03:35.860, Speaker A: Ha.
00:03:38.310 - 00:03:39.374, Speaker C: Keep up that rhYthm.

00:03:47.212 - 00:03:50.678, Speaker C: We really want to keep activating. In about 10 seconds, we're going to.
00:03:50.684 - 00:03:52.310, Speaker B: Do a short breath held.
00:03:55.790 - 00:03:57.850, Speaker C: And we're going to do a long exhale.
00:04:00.430 - 00:04:10.830, Speaker B: LEt's hold on the exhale. Hold Our breath right there. Hold on the exhale. Keep holding. Three, two, one.
00:04:10.900 - 00:04:12.190, Speaker E: Deep inhale.

00:04:30.360 - 00:04:43.522, Speaker C: All through the nose and out the mouth. It should be fatiguing.
00:04:43.666 - 00:04:48.810, Speaker B: It should really start moving SOME OXyGeN. We're mainly unloading CO2 here.
00:04:48.880 - 00:04:50.970, Speaker C: That's the goal, really activating.
00:05:01.490 - 00:05:02.430, Speaker D: Keep it up.
00:05:02.500 - 00:05:09.840, Speaker B: You're doing great. Come on, take some effort. There's some work in this. We're elevating the heart rate. We're really working through the body.
00:05:14.870 - 00:05:16.290, Speaker C: All right, relax.
00:05:18.470 - 00:05:19.890, Speaker E: Deep inhale.
00:05:22.070 - 00:05:41.850, Speaker B: Long exhale. LEt's continue that. Two more rounds. Deep inhale, long exhale. We're going to breathe all through the nose quite fast. Now in order to move some nitric oxide that we only get through nose breathing here in a moment. We're going to go one more deep breath.
00:05:41.850 - 00:06:03.250, Speaker B: And now we're going to go all nose. I know it's difficult in the desert breathing all through our nose, but we're trying to really activate here. Really try to be aggressive on that. Nose breathing.
00:06:08.230 - 00:06:08.594, Speaker A: In.
00:06:08.632 - 00:06:09.246, Speaker C: 10 seconds.

00:06:21.298 - 00:06:29.580, Speaker B: The mind, get to offload that CO2, get a ton of oxygen into the system. It's going to help us in a moment when we really slow down and focus.
00:06:32.510 - 00:06:34.620, Speaker C: Give me Ten more seconds of that.
00:06:38.920 - 00:06:39.476, Speaker D: Good.

00:07:15.740 - 00:07:48.696, Speaker B: And now you should be ready to start attacking your day. Being ready to sort of think, focus, mental acuity, alertness, all comes from that. I do this with a lot of our military operators prior to them, either they're on a helo or they're about to move into something we actually do spend some time, those five, six minutes fully ready, doing some breath work. They're active, evaded a lot of oxygen, moved through their system, a lot of nitric oxide to really get them going and have now you should all be.
00:07:48.718 - 00:07:49.512, Speaker A: Ready for your day.
