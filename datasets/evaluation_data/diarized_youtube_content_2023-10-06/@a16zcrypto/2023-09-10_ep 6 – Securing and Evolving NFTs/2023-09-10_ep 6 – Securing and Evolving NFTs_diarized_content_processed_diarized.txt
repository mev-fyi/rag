00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.290 - 00:01:18.366, Speaker B: Welcome to Web Three with a Six and Z, a show about building the next generation of the Internet from the team at A Six and Z Crypto that includes Me, your host Sonal. This show is for anyone, whether developer, artist, community leader, startup entrepreneur, or other builder seeking to understand and go deeper on all things crypto and Web Three towards a decentralized, community owned and creator owned internet. Speaking of this week's episode, digs deeper into NFTs, focusing especially on security and addressing also a few very common myths and misconceptions along the way. It builds on a more basic NFT explained episode from 2021 on the Asics and C podcast, which I ran previously. That includes Me and two close friends of Asics and C Crypto, breaking down everything you need or want to know about NFTs, but it's separate from this one. In this episode, we go into specifics on what exactly is in the NFT or around the NFT, what exactly is in the smart contract and the metadata, and more. Before we dig into all the related security topics, including some best practices at various levels, and discuss the evolution of NFTs across applications and mediums, including dynamic NFTs for art, to identity to experiences.
00:01:18.366 - 00:02:24.502, Speaker B: Our expert guests in this casual hallway jam with me are two Asics and Z Crypto team members Michael Blau, an engineering partner at Asics NZ Crypto, who spends his time between investing and also working on new protocols, simulations, and tools. For instance, he recently released, after this episode was recorded, a tool for detecting metamorphic smart contracts that can be changed even if seemingly immutable, as well as a tool that detects sleep minting to fake provenance and ownership. You can find those at Asics and Zcrypto.com. Michael is also known by his NFT artist alias as Exor. His most recent works artistically include a dynamic NFT Mev Army and ASCII Art that visually represents and incorporates different ethereum technologies within the artworks. Then we also have Naseem Edikuak, who is the Chief Information Security Officer at Asics and Z Crypto, and was previously at Facebook Blockchain, where he worked on all the security, infrastructure and custody there, along with his coworker Riaz, who joined Asics and Z Crypto as CTO. Prior to that, Naseem worked in R and D security, key management and more at Anchorage, and before that, Docker and at Apple.
00:02:24.502 - 00:03:00.566, Speaker B: And Naseem also released a personal NFT project after this episode was recorded, called Rebels by Night, a PFP collection of dynamic NFTs aimed at on chain customization. As a reminder, none of the following is investment, business, tax, or legal advice. Please see Asics.com disclosures for more important information, including a link to a list of our investments. We begin the conversation for the first ten minutes with some quick context on NFTs redefining it more specifically beyond as just a non fungible token. Then go into NFT security and then discuss trends and applications of interest now and ahead so can you guys just.
00:03:00.588 - 00:03:02.902, Speaker C: Quickly break down for me what is.
00:03:02.956 - 00:03:05.682, Speaker A: Actually in the smart contract around an NFT?
00:03:05.746 - 00:03:07.894, Speaker C: Because this is something that I think there's a lot of misconceptions about.
00:03:07.932 - 00:03:09.974, Speaker A: Can you guys just quickly give an overview of that?
00:03:10.092 - 00:03:12.362, Speaker D: Sure. The analogy that I use is you.
00:03:12.416 - 00:03:14.058, Speaker E: Have this one smart contract which you.
00:03:14.064 - 00:03:19.322, Speaker D: Could think of as a bucket. And on one side of the bucket you have like an Excel spreadsheet which.
00:03:19.376 - 00:03:21.658, Speaker E: Keeps track of an address or a.
00:03:21.664 - 00:03:24.142, Speaker D: Wallet address, and then a Token ID.
00:03:24.196 - 00:03:27.278, Speaker E: Or an NFT Token ID. And if you think about like an.
00:03:27.284 - 00:03:30.346, Speaker D: Excel spreadsheet, each row is if it's.
00:03:30.378 - 00:03:32.254, Speaker E: Your address in the same row as.
00:03:32.292 - 00:03:57.974, Speaker D: The NFT Token ID, that means that you own it. So that's like one side of the smart contract. The other side of the smart contract is arbitrary functionality or code that defines the rules of how this asset or token is transferred. So if I wanted to transfer this NFT to Nas, what really happens under the hood is it's just shuffling rows on this Excel spreadsheet, but the code is actually doing that.
00:03:58.012 - 00:03:59.478, Speaker E: And the code will do things like.
00:03:59.564 - 00:04:22.650, Speaker D: Check to see do I really own the token that I'm trying to transfer? Is he able to actually receive this token or code that lets me check to see who owns token number one. And it's code that looks into the Excel spreadsheet and then will return back out the owner. So it's basically a spreadsheet, a record, and then code that facilitates how that record is updated.
00:04:22.810 - 00:04:23.966, Speaker A: So the other way that I've heard.
00:04:23.988 - 00:04:25.454, Speaker C: It defined, this is from Chris Dixon.
00:04:25.502 - 00:04:27.682, Speaker A: Founder of Asics and Z crypto, is.
00:04:27.736 - 00:04:35.630, Speaker C: That an NFT is simply a blockchain based record that uniquely represent pieces of media. And that media can be anything digital.
00:04:35.710 - 00:04:42.738, Speaker A: Including art, videos, music, gifs, I will not say gifs, games, text, memes, and just any code, frankly.
00:04:42.914 - 00:04:52.066, Speaker F: So the interesting part about NFTs is that if you think about NFTs as, there is this token Identifier that actually identifies the NFT itself.
00:04:52.188 - 00:04:57.066, Speaker G: But the content of the NFT can be anything. Anything that we think about right now.
00:04:57.088 - 00:05:05.838, Speaker F: We focus a lot on kind of like the visual aspects of it. But it could be music, it could be code, it could be websites, entire websites. It can be anything like rich media.
00:05:05.924 - 00:05:16.078, Speaker G: Content or other things like property deeds. But the NFT is actually the envelope plus the data itself. Think about emails.
00:05:16.174 - 00:05:18.130, Speaker F: The email is not just the content.
00:05:18.200 - 00:05:20.930, Speaker G: Of what Nas sent to Michael Black.
00:05:21.000 - 00:05:24.066, Speaker F: Right. It is also all the metadata that.
00:05:24.088 - 00:05:26.766, Speaker G: Comes with it to ensure who actually.
00:05:26.808 - 00:05:31.318, Speaker F: Sent the email, who is actually receiving the email, was there any security property.
00:05:31.404 - 00:05:40.450, Speaker G: Encryption, who actually invalidated all these properties, what is the format? And so many things, right? And so it's important to keep in.
00:05:40.460 - 00:05:44.698, Speaker F: Mind that NFTs are not just the end content that is delivered to the.
00:05:44.704 - 00:05:47.734, Speaker G: User, but it's also this rich metadata.
00:05:47.782 - 00:05:49.466, Speaker F: All around it that provides a lot.
00:05:49.488 - 00:06:09.618, Speaker G: Of context that is essential to the NFT itself. And so this is a very simple system, but the guarantees that are provided by the blockchain around permissions and immutability really of this code really gives very strong properties. And we could have implemented NFTs in.
00:06:09.624 - 00:06:19.782, Speaker F: A bunch of other ways without blockchain. But the reality is that the blockchain gives us the properties of immutability and basically like trust in the system and.
00:06:19.836 - 00:06:27.874, Speaker G: The mapping that we need in order to build products at scale without any source of truth that is centralized.
00:06:28.002 - 00:06:32.218, Speaker C: By the way, by context, do you mean stuff like the traits and other details or like what specifically when you.
00:06:32.224 - 00:06:33.318, Speaker A: Think of the context?
00:06:33.494 - 00:06:35.370, Speaker F: Exactly, it could be the traits.
00:06:36.110 - 00:06:41.706, Speaker G: If you think about emails, sending I'm down is not going to mean the.
00:06:41.728 - 00:06:44.494, Speaker F: Same based on if you're replying from.
00:06:44.532 - 00:06:51.166, Speaker G: A certain source address to another recipient, the recipient changing will actually impact the.
00:06:51.188 - 00:06:53.582, Speaker F: Meaning of the message that you're sending.
00:06:53.646 - 00:06:59.122, Speaker G: And it's the same with NFTs. With NFTs, having different traits obviously can.
00:06:59.176 - 00:07:01.330, Speaker F: Mean different things, but you can actually.
00:07:01.400 - 00:07:03.618, Speaker G: Add anything to the metadata, right?
00:07:03.704 - 00:07:09.174, Speaker F: You're free to populate the metadata of the NFT with any type of information.
00:07:09.372 - 00:07:17.830, Speaker G: It could be source and recipient, just like emails, it could be an encryption envelope around it that defines who is.
00:07:17.900 - 00:07:24.502, Speaker F: Able to decrypt it. It can be read anything ranging from when this thing was created, when this thing was modified.
00:07:24.646 - 00:07:26.570, Speaker G: Maybe it has several versions, right?
00:07:26.640 - 00:07:28.474, Speaker F: Maybe you're storing the version zero and.
00:07:28.512 - 00:07:33.246, Speaker G: The last version of some piece of data. And so keep that in mind as.
00:07:33.268 - 00:07:37.210, Speaker F: An entire space that we have this envelope that we can modify at wheel.
00:07:37.290 - 00:07:48.370, Speaker G: To provide more and more context around the data. And I really hope that we are all going to try to experiment more and more what we can do with it.
00:07:48.440 - 00:07:49.554, Speaker C: Before we go into what you just.
00:07:49.592 - 00:08:03.442, Speaker B: Mentioned us about the experiments and then we'll go into the security, let's really quickly chat more about what is and isn't in the smart contract, including that notion that you can encode functionality like secondary royalties for creators.
00:08:03.586 - 00:08:13.034, Speaker D: So a smart contract allows you to both store one of these limited digital assets, tokens or NFTs, but it also.
00:08:13.072 - 00:08:14.662, Speaker E: Allows you to, like you said, encode.
00:08:14.726 - 00:08:31.454, Speaker D: Other functionality around it. However, it is a common misconception in the NFT community that the smart contract itself facilitates secondary royalties to creators. Actually, that is not the case. Rather, secondary royalties are honored by the.
00:08:31.492 - 00:08:33.422, Speaker E: Marketplace that the NFT trades on.
00:08:33.476 - 00:08:35.562, Speaker A: I thought the beauty of an NFT.
00:08:35.626 - 00:08:38.482, Speaker C: Is that if something gets sold or resold and currently in the art market.
00:08:38.536 - 00:08:40.834, Speaker A: To use an example, artists never get.
00:08:40.872 - 00:08:43.202, Speaker C: The secondary royalties unless there's some way they know.
00:08:43.256 - 00:08:44.994, Speaker A: But because of the ability to track.
00:08:45.112 - 00:08:47.726, Speaker C: Provenance and I thought encode that information.
00:08:47.848 - 00:08:49.926, Speaker A: Into a smart contract, that is how.
00:08:49.948 - 00:08:52.146, Speaker C: That guarantee is made. But you are saying that that guarantee.
00:08:52.178 - 00:08:54.690, Speaker A: Is actually provided by the marketplace.
00:08:54.850 - 00:08:58.774, Speaker D: Correct. So technically speaking, you could do some.
00:08:58.812 - 00:09:04.762, Speaker E: Over the counter trade of an NFT. Like I could trade an NFT with Nos and say, Nos, I'll send you.
00:09:04.816 - 00:09:10.426, Speaker D: One NFT and you can send me two ETH. And that transaction, 0% of that two.
00:09:10.448 - 00:09:12.182, Speaker E: ETH will go to a creator.
00:09:12.246 - 00:09:14.038, Speaker D: It will go 100% to Nos.
00:09:14.134 - 00:09:15.646, Speaker E: And the reason why that is is.
00:09:15.668 - 00:09:25.498, Speaker D: There are actually a lot of reasons, but like two of them and I'll let Nos at all as well, is what happens in a situation where, let's say I own an NFT in my.
00:09:25.524 - 00:09:27.250, Speaker E: MetaMask wallet, but I want to transfer.
00:09:27.320 - 00:09:29.902, Speaker D: It to my hardware wallet or my ledger.
00:09:30.046 - 00:09:33.330, Speaker E: Well, that transfer of the NFT is still to myself.
00:09:33.400 - 00:09:37.614, Speaker D: I'm not actually selling it, but if you put a limit or a percentage.
00:09:37.662 - 00:09:39.638, Speaker E: Fee every time an NFT transfers, which.
00:09:39.644 - 00:09:40.934, Speaker D: Is how it would have to work.
00:09:41.052 - 00:09:45.430, Speaker E: Then basically I would be paying the artist the fee even when I'm transferring it with myself.
00:09:45.580 - 00:09:48.918, Speaker A: Oh, that's great. Not great, but yeah, that's great.
00:09:49.004 - 00:09:50.298, Speaker E: And the second point, and there's a.
00:09:50.304 - 00:10:02.006, Speaker D: Caveat to this one, is that NFTs are smart contracts and creators in the space don't always actually have ownership over those smart contracts. And what that means is that if.
00:10:02.048 - 00:10:03.294, Speaker E: For example, you did want to create.
00:10:03.332 - 00:10:11.294, Speaker D: An NFT, where, indeed, every time it transferred, the smart contract collected a royalty in order for the creator to go.
00:10:11.332 - 00:10:13.910, Speaker E: And withdraw those royalties from the smart.
00:10:13.930 - 00:10:35.414, Speaker D: Contract because the royalties would accrue within a smart contract. That means that the NFT creator would have to have ownership over that smart contract. And oftentimes when you're creating NFTs at scale, creators don't actually have on chain ownership over those smart contracts. Marketplaces do, or there is no owner at all. So it's kind of like a low.
00:10:35.452 - 00:10:37.606, Speaker E: Level specification of the smart contract that.
00:10:37.628 - 00:10:38.930, Speaker G: Would make it challenging.
00:10:39.090 - 00:10:42.826, Speaker F: Michael covered it well. Obviously, smart contracts add code and can.
00:10:42.848 - 00:10:46.090, Speaker G: Make the code do a lot of things, including this.
00:10:46.240 - 00:10:49.146, Speaker F: But this is just an extremely complex thing to do.
00:10:49.248 - 00:10:54.254, Speaker G: And so current systems are just for the sake of end user friendliness and.
00:10:54.292 - 00:10:56.346, Speaker F: Scalability and so on, are not designed.
00:10:56.378 - 00:10:59.934, Speaker G: To have that natively. But there are some standards that are.
00:10:59.972 - 00:11:10.958, Speaker F: Part of the NFT specifications that enable Marketplaces to query the contract to request. How many royalties should I apply as a marketplace?
00:11:11.054 - 00:11:11.410, Speaker A: Great.
00:11:11.480 - 00:11:13.326, Speaker C: Before we talk about the security standards.
00:11:13.358 - 00:11:23.990, Speaker B: And the trade offs between scale and usability, as you just mentioned, the role of Marketplaces and others in the ecosystem, I'd actually love to hear from you guys. How would you even break this topic down?
00:11:24.060 - 00:11:24.962, Speaker C: Like, conceptually?
00:11:25.026 - 00:11:34.570, Speaker B: I mean, it's a big topic, there's lots we could cover for many episodes. But as an overview, what framework should we even use to talk about this? The topic itself.
00:11:34.720 - 00:11:40.154, Speaker D: So the way that I sort of think about NFTs in general and you can kind of tackle each is this.
00:11:40.192 - 00:11:42.262, Speaker E: Framework that I like to call the NFT stack.
00:11:42.326 - 00:11:47.966, Speaker D: And you can go through each component of the stack and dissect the security implications of each.
00:11:48.068 - 00:11:49.854, Speaker E: I'll give you the high level overview of what it is.
00:11:49.892 - 00:11:53.566, Speaker D: So the very first level is just simply the art, the artist or the.
00:11:53.588 - 00:11:55.342, Speaker E: Creator coming up with some media type.
00:11:55.396 - 00:11:57.874, Speaker D: So that's an image, that's a 3D.
00:11:57.912 - 00:12:00.594, Speaker E: File, that's a website, it's a piece of code, whatever it might be, whatever.
00:12:00.632 - 00:12:06.254, Speaker D: The media content is, that's step one. Step two would be the actual smart.
00:12:06.302 - 00:12:13.286, Speaker E: Contract that's hosting this NFT, that's hosting any of the metadata for the NFT, that's hosting the functionality of how this.
00:12:13.308 - 00:12:26.666, Speaker D: NFT should be traded. That's the next layer of the stack. Then comes the primary issuance of the NFT. So how does a user purchase or acquire the NFT? Is it free? Is it paid? Is there an auction mechanic, is it.
00:12:26.688 - 00:12:27.834, Speaker E: On a centralized platform?
00:12:27.952 - 00:12:35.306, Speaker D: Is it in a smart contract, et cetera? The next part comes is the secondary marketplace. So where does this NFT be traded.
00:12:35.338 - 00:12:36.846, Speaker E: After the fact, if it can be.
00:12:36.868 - 00:12:39.838, Speaker D: Traded after the fact? And then the final component, which is.
00:12:39.844 - 00:12:42.282, Speaker E: Sort of like beyond, is token gating.
00:12:42.346 - 00:12:43.966, Speaker D: Now that you own this token, what.
00:12:43.988 - 00:12:46.734, Speaker E: Do you do with it? How is it used across platforms?
00:12:46.862 - 00:12:48.786, Speaker D: And as you move from website to.
00:12:48.808 - 00:12:52.226, Speaker E: Website and web3, or DAP to DAP, whether that's Discord or Instagram or.
00:12:52.248 - 00:12:54.818, Speaker D: Twitter, how does this NFT connect to.
00:12:54.824 - 00:12:58.634, Speaker E: That application and how is it used there? So I call that the token gating stage.
00:12:58.702 - 00:13:00.546, Speaker D: And that's like my high level stack.
00:13:00.658 - 00:13:04.118, Speaker E: Probably the most important one really is the smart contract level, which is the.
00:13:04.124 - 00:13:06.870, Speaker D: First one, and the security implications there.
00:13:07.020 - 00:13:10.986, Speaker G: I think that this has the right level of granularity. I tend to segment things as for.
00:13:11.008 - 00:13:20.666, Speaker F: The user across different types of directions, like what are the threats that they're exposed to, what is their attack surface basically looking like? Same thing for a marketplace, same thing.
00:13:20.688 - 00:13:22.374, Speaker G: For the creator or the smart contract.
00:13:22.422 - 00:13:23.994, Speaker F: Itself, which is almost like a different.
00:13:24.032 - 00:13:24.910, Speaker G: Party at this point.
00:13:24.980 - 00:13:28.474, Speaker A: I think what we should do then is let's go down the vertical stack.
00:13:28.522 - 00:13:30.478, Speaker C: That Michael just outlined, which is kind.
00:13:30.484 - 00:13:35.358, Speaker A: Of a cycle of an NFT in almost a linear way. And then let's take a bit more.
00:13:35.364 - 00:13:37.506, Speaker C: Of a horizontal tack across all the.
00:13:37.528 - 00:13:44.226, Speaker A: Parties as you mentioned, whether user or creator, marketplace, and then also bring in some of the other key trends that.
00:13:44.248 - 00:13:46.658, Speaker C: May come in and just attack it that way.
00:13:46.744 - 00:13:47.410, Speaker A: That's great.
00:13:47.480 - 00:13:49.042, Speaker C: So Michael, you said the most important.
00:13:49.096 - 00:13:52.038, Speaker A: Is a smart contract and it's like the first step, but in fact the.
00:13:52.044 - 00:13:54.310, Speaker C: First step is really like the art or the asset itself.
00:13:54.380 - 00:13:56.598, Speaker A: So, super quick, is there anything security.
00:13:56.684 - 00:13:58.786, Speaker C: Related at this level to be aware.
00:13:58.818 - 00:14:05.110, Speaker A: Of whether the art is a image, a piece of music or whatever. That creative artifact.
00:14:05.270 - 00:14:10.106, Speaker E: 100% actually. And I know not has a lot to say on the topic as well, but I'll kind of give the high.
00:14:10.128 - 00:14:14.794, Speaker D: Level view very much so, which is that like we said before, an NFT.
00:14:14.842 - 00:14:18.894, Speaker E: Can point to any media. And what happens if that media is.
00:14:18.932 - 00:14:21.598, Speaker D: A website or an SVG, which is.
00:14:21.604 - 00:14:23.526, Speaker E: Like a common format for on chain artwork.
00:14:23.578 - 00:14:25.198, Speaker A: Yeah, especially generative artwork.
00:14:25.294 - 00:14:31.042, Speaker D: Exactly. Like these media files can and do contain executable code.
00:14:31.176 - 00:14:31.522, Speaker F: Right?
00:14:31.576 - 00:14:32.786, Speaker E: And all of a sudden you can.
00:14:32.808 - 00:14:34.978, Speaker D: Run into a situation where when you.
00:14:34.984 - 00:14:38.326, Speaker E: Have like a display layer, so marketplace or a wallet that's showing you your.
00:14:38.348 - 00:14:44.022, Speaker D: NFT collection, the application, the client side, the front end is reading in this.
00:14:44.076 - 00:14:46.326, Speaker E: Dynamic file, like an HTML file or.
00:14:46.348 - 00:14:56.358, Speaker D: An Executable file, and it's executing that code in your browser to render an image. And that means that you have code coming in from the blockchain that you're.
00:14:56.374 - 00:14:58.726, Speaker E: Not aware of executing on your local machine.
00:14:58.838 - 00:15:01.786, Speaker D: Which of course could have a lot of security implications. Yes.
00:15:01.808 - 00:15:03.230, Speaker F: So these are things that we actually.
00:15:03.300 - 00:15:05.742, Speaker G: Saw in the wild actually happen.
00:15:05.876 - 00:15:21.634, Speaker F: And this is not a new problem. Right. The email providers and Facebook and other companies have been displaying images for a very long time. Very complex media types that oftentimes require code execution in order to perform as.
00:15:21.672 - 00:15:32.230, Speaker G: Expected, whether that's rendering an image, a video, executing code in order to get sound like HTML pages and so on. And as we are trying to develop.
00:15:32.380 - 00:15:35.314, Speaker F: Art that gets more dynamic and produce.
00:15:35.362 - 00:15:43.638, Speaker G: More information, execution of code becomes part of the equation. And so SVG is, for example, allowing.
00:15:43.654 - 00:15:45.802, Speaker F: You to execute JavaScript and so on.
00:15:45.936 - 00:16:01.194, Speaker G: Can, if not properly contained by whichever layer actually does the display, can actually very well escape their sandbox environment and perform malicious action, potentially make a request.
00:16:01.242 - 00:16:03.406, Speaker F: To MetaMask to sign a transaction or.
00:16:03.428 - 00:16:11.330, Speaker G: Like pop up to request to sign a transaction that could your wallet and so on. And so it is the responsibility of.
00:16:11.400 - 00:16:16.542, Speaker F: Obviously Marketplaces to check that, but it is also the responsibility for the creators.
00:16:16.606 - 00:16:20.394, Speaker G: To actually make safe content available to their users.
00:16:20.462 - 00:16:25.378, Speaker C: And are there any ways to protect people here? Because just to really ground this for people, when you guys say SVGs, that's.
00:16:25.394 - 00:16:26.930, Speaker A: Like a scalable vector graphic.
00:16:27.010 - 00:16:29.926, Speaker C: It's been around since the late 90s. It's nothing new.
00:16:29.948 - 00:16:31.658, Speaker A: And I'm really glad you pointed that.
00:16:31.664 - 00:16:36.298, Speaker C: Out, Nas, because this is actually not technically a new problem. What's interesting here though is part of.
00:16:36.304 - 00:16:38.874, Speaker A: The opportunity here is not just like.
00:16:38.912 - 00:16:46.174, Speaker C: Animated Gifs and video and rendering HTML pages, but the Dynamism of NFTs is I think, incredibly interesting as well because.
00:16:46.292 - 00:16:47.806, Speaker A: To me it's really about creating this.
00:16:47.828 - 00:16:49.402, Speaker C: New world of generative artists.
00:16:49.466 - 00:16:50.974, Speaker A: Like generative art has been around for.
00:16:51.012 - 00:16:53.006, Speaker C: Decades and I'm a huge consumer and.
00:16:53.028 - 00:16:56.686, Speaker A: Fan of it, but there's an argument being made right now that now it's.
00:16:56.718 - 00:16:59.422, Speaker C: Almost like it's a blockchain native format.
00:16:59.486 - 00:17:06.738, Speaker A: That'S like really finding its moment. So can you say more about this? Because this has implications for possibilities of.
00:17:06.744 - 00:17:10.674, Speaker C: What we can do with NFTs. What can creators do, what can platforms.
00:17:10.722 - 00:17:14.934, Speaker A: Do, what can MetaMask do to make this a little bit better for people? Yes.
00:17:14.972 - 00:17:17.410, Speaker F: So there is this process called sanitization.
00:17:17.570 - 00:17:21.114, Speaker G: Input sanitization which is basically taking any.
00:17:21.152 - 00:17:23.514, Speaker F: Form of input that is provided by.
00:17:23.552 - 00:17:29.874, Speaker G: A user and modify it and edit it in a way that makes it non malicious.
00:17:30.022 - 00:17:40.126, Speaker F: So you're basically proactively removing certain capabilities, for example, in the case of SVG, doing certain HTML or JavaScript actions that.
00:17:40.148 - 00:17:44.706, Speaker G: Could allow it to escape the safe environment and it is going to be.
00:17:44.728 - 00:17:47.826, Speaker F: The responsibility from marketplaces and wallets and.
00:17:47.848 - 00:17:50.002, Speaker G: So on to do a better job.
00:17:50.056 - 00:17:53.474, Speaker F: At sanitizing various types of media.
00:17:53.592 - 00:17:54.322, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:17:54.376 - 00:17:56.658, Speaker F: And we know that this is a very hard problem because at the end.
00:17:56.664 - 00:17:57.926, Speaker G: Of the day, when you look at.
00:17:57.948 - 00:17:59.986, Speaker F: Email providers, I think that email providers.
00:18:00.018 - 00:18:17.322, Speaker G: Are actually one of the best examples. They're transmitting and delivering to you any type of data. They do malware analysis, they actually do a lot of verification on the data that is shared with you prior to actually allowing you to opening it.
00:18:17.376 - 00:18:20.106, Speaker F: Right, because they have your safety in.
00:18:20.128 - 00:18:21.626, Speaker G: Mind and it is going to be.
00:18:21.648 - 00:18:25.998, Speaker F: The same for every single players that is responsible for delivering you with data.
00:18:26.084 - 00:18:30.030, Speaker G: Marketplaces and experience providers, metaverses and so on.
00:18:30.100 - 00:18:31.626, Speaker C: I mean, for me the email analogy.
00:18:31.658 - 00:18:33.374, Speaker A: Really resonates because I think of the.
00:18:33.412 - 00:18:37.586, Speaker C: Degree of familiarity people have with email. A lot of us are very savvy with email, but then I think about.
00:18:37.608 - 00:18:39.570, Speaker A: My parents, they can't tell the difference.
00:18:39.640 - 00:18:46.910, Speaker C: Between like a phishing scam or an email that has malicious code that could execute in it. So the providers doing this for them is hugely valuable.
00:18:46.990 - 00:18:49.938, Speaker A: And I think we have a similar issue with NFTs.
00:18:50.034 - 00:18:50.342, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:50.396 - 00:18:51.974, Speaker E: The only points I'd add is something.
00:18:52.012 - 00:18:54.054, Speaker D: That'S almost a little bit scarier with.
00:18:54.092 - 00:18:57.446, Speaker E: NFTs than with something like email is that you could definitely have a situation.
00:18:57.548 - 00:19:03.994, Speaker D: Where somebody will AirDrop you an NFT that has this malicious functionality, but that.
00:19:04.032 - 00:19:10.230, Speaker E: NFT is non transferable, so you couldn't even get it out of your wallet if you wanted to. Right, and it's there forever.
00:19:10.310 - 00:19:12.666, Speaker D: And every website that ever reads your.
00:19:12.688 - 00:19:21.886, Speaker E: Wallet data always needs to be aware of these assets and how to exactly what not said is sanitize them. The other point, it's not so much about security, but it's about how you.
00:19:21.908 - 00:19:24.198, Speaker D: Mentioned how this idea of generative artists.
00:19:24.234 - 00:19:26.674, Speaker E: Taking off with NFTs in a different way.
00:19:26.712 - 00:19:36.594, Speaker D: And I think the reason for that is because oftentimes NFT assets are not actually stored on the blockchain where your token is stored on the blockchain, but.
00:19:36.632 - 00:19:42.198, Speaker E: The actual media file and metadata is stored on some decentralized hosting service such.
00:19:42.204 - 00:19:44.406, Speaker D: As like IPFS or Rweave. And by the way, the reason for.
00:19:44.428 - 00:19:45.734, Speaker E: That is because if you were to.
00:19:45.852 - 00:19:48.066, Speaker D: Store a full image on the blockchain.
00:19:48.098 - 00:19:49.138, Speaker E: That would be very expensive.
00:19:49.234 - 00:19:50.666, Speaker D: That'd be a lot of gas cost.
00:19:50.768 - 00:19:52.886, Speaker E: However, when you have something that's generative.
00:19:52.998 - 00:19:55.354, Speaker D: You'Re not actually necessarily storing a whole.
00:19:55.392 - 00:19:56.954, Speaker E: Image, rather you're storing a piece of.
00:19:56.992 - 00:20:04.954, Speaker D: Code that sort of unwraps and generates itself on demand to show you an image. And that's I think why that's taken.
00:20:04.992 - 00:20:06.230, Speaker E: Off of the NFTs because you could.
00:20:06.240 - 00:20:08.426, Speaker D: All of a sudden actually store quote.
00:20:08.458 - 00:20:12.622, Speaker E: Unquote images on chain but you're really just storing the generative code which is really cool.
00:20:12.676 - 00:20:17.118, Speaker A: I'm so glad you said that. I'm just a huge passionate consumer fan.
00:20:17.214 - 00:20:17.762, Speaker G: Same.
00:20:17.896 - 00:20:26.360, Speaker B: Is there anything more to add on this first layer or this linear phase of the NFT stack before we talk about the smart contract itself?
00:20:26.730 - 00:20:38.634, Speaker G: Yeah, stuff that we're starting to be very concerned about is leaking any form of art or metadata about the drop even before it actually happens because it.
00:20:38.672 - 00:20:40.186, Speaker F: Actually allows you to make a lot.
00:20:40.208 - 00:20:47.354, Speaker G: Of educated decisions, basically insider knowledge about what is generated, what are the traits and so on.
00:20:47.392 - 00:20:53.514, Speaker F: And having this information even regardless of the blockchain ahead of time is extremely valuable.
00:20:53.642 - 00:20:56.154, Speaker G: And we've seen that in the leak.
00:20:56.202 - 00:21:10.078, Speaker F: Of information prior to highly anticipated drops. And so it's very critical to also be conscious as a creator that the content that you're creating, the metadata may actually be extremely valuable even without being on the blockchain anywhere.
00:21:10.174 - 00:21:19.906, Speaker G: Right, and sometimes taking the proper steps to even encrypt it if you have like a highly anticipated job is very important because people will want to try.
00:21:19.928 - 00:21:21.654, Speaker F: To get this information before the rest.
00:21:21.692 - 00:21:23.014, Speaker G: Of the NFT space.
00:21:23.132 - 00:21:24.022, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense.
00:21:24.076 - 00:21:25.894, Speaker C: I mean, to be honest, it feels like there's a bit of a cash.
00:21:25.932 - 00:21:31.026, Speaker A: 22 there because on one hand part of the community building purpose because we're.
00:21:31.058 - 00:21:34.006, Speaker C: Talking about these assets as if they're just like living in an isolated ecosystem.
00:21:34.038 - 00:21:39.514, Speaker A: And clearly they're not. Like you both have your own personal NFT projects, several in fact and a.
00:21:39.552 - 00:21:48.426, Speaker C: Big component of that is a community building and some of that excitement of the high demand launches is around that community building. And so it's not just a critic.
00:21:48.458 - 00:21:56.974, Speaker A: Rug pull, it's really just that's the idea there. And I wonder if you guys have thoughts on how just as related to the security issue, what people should be.
00:21:57.012 - 00:22:02.754, Speaker C: Thinking about here besides simply encrypting some of the details. Because part of the point is marketing, to be clear.
00:22:02.792 - 00:22:04.370, Speaker A: So I just want to make sure we address that.
00:22:04.520 - 00:22:06.110, Speaker D: Yeah, this is a hard one, at.
00:22:06.120 - 00:22:14.374, Speaker E: Least in my own personal experience when it comes to hiding the metadata and strategies around that. It oftentimes was a combination of web.
00:22:14.412 - 00:22:17.366, Speaker D: Two and web3 technology where a.
00:22:17.388 - 00:22:22.026, Speaker E: Huge component of web3 technology which is actually what makes this problem arise in the first place, is exactly what.
00:22:22.048 - 00:22:24.634, Speaker D: NASA is saying is if someone tried.
00:22:24.672 - 00:22:31.914, Speaker E: Hard enough, all the data on these decentralized storage platforms or the blockchain is publicly available. Yes. So if you wanted to hide it.
00:22:31.952 - 00:22:35.326, Speaker D: You do need some Web Two component, right?
00:22:35.348 - 00:22:38.462, Speaker E: There needs to be like a centralized server at some point in the process.
00:22:38.596 - 00:22:39.870, Speaker G: To hide this data.
00:22:40.020 - 00:22:42.046, Speaker D: And what ends up happening in that.
00:22:42.068 - 00:22:44.106, Speaker E: Situation, just speaking from personal experience, is.
00:22:44.148 - 00:22:46.882, Speaker D: The technology at its current state is.
00:22:46.936 - 00:22:48.466, Speaker E: Probably not developed enough yet to be.
00:22:48.488 - 00:22:57.358, Speaker D: Able to beautifully and smoothly link Web Two and Web Three especially. When you have situations where, let's say.
00:22:57.384 - 00:23:04.706, Speaker E: It'S a super high demand mint, and you're hosting your files on a small server that you just kind of spun.
00:23:04.738 - 00:23:11.574, Speaker D: Up on AWS with not a lot of scaling. That server can very easily crash when you have hundreds of thousands of people.
00:23:11.612 - 00:23:15.658, Speaker E: Trying to mint your NFT at once and it's kind of trying to connect your server and then the blockchain and.
00:23:15.664 - 00:23:17.226, Speaker D: Then the server needs to know when.
00:23:17.248 - 00:23:19.050, Speaker E: It'S been minted to make the NFT available.
00:23:19.120 - 00:23:22.902, Speaker D: And they're communicating back and forth and you kind of get this weird knot.
00:23:22.966 - 00:23:24.494, Speaker E: Of web Two and Web Three, which.
00:23:24.532 - 00:23:27.162, Speaker D: Could lead to some bad user experiences.
00:23:27.226 - 00:23:31.242, Speaker C: Yeah, it just means we're early. But that's a very nice analogy of that tangled knot.
00:23:31.306 - 00:23:32.558, Speaker A: Let's go into the next layer of.
00:23:32.564 - 00:23:39.426, Speaker C: The stack, which is a smart contract and all the functionality that is encoded within that. And so let's talk about security at.
00:23:39.448 - 00:23:40.706, Speaker A: That level for this one.
00:23:40.728 - 00:23:42.402, Speaker G: There are just so many things that.
00:23:42.536 - 00:23:49.634, Speaker F: Pertain to the smart contracts themselves, right? You can think about flawed smart contracts, you can think about malicious smart contracts.
00:23:49.682 - 00:23:53.202, Speaker G: You can think of malicious NFT distribution.
00:23:53.346 - 00:23:55.314, Speaker F: That actually goes through the smart contract.
00:23:55.362 - 00:23:57.318, Speaker G: And sometimes it is required for the.
00:23:57.324 - 00:23:59.834, Speaker F: Smart contract to have features directly inside.
00:23:59.872 - 00:24:03.146, Speaker G: The code that enforce the randomness of.
00:24:03.168 - 00:24:11.958, Speaker F: The distribution and other properties. And also the contracts themselves need also to be resistant to things like boughting.
00:24:12.054 - 00:24:13.274, Speaker G: And a few other things.
00:24:13.392 - 00:24:20.414, Speaker D: Yeah, I totally agree. And the way that I sort of think about it is like the way we started this whole podcast is talking.
00:24:20.452 - 00:24:22.046, Speaker E: About how we have this NFT that.
00:24:22.068 - 00:24:24.722, Speaker D: Is a token and then functionality to.
00:24:24.776 - 00:24:28.798, Speaker E: Manage how that token is transferred amongst different users.
00:24:28.974 - 00:24:38.726, Speaker D: And that functionality, like just that the storage of a number token identifier and the transferring functionality that is pretty much standard.
00:24:38.828 - 00:24:46.322, Speaker E: I mean, you can go right now and use the standard ERC, seven to one or 1155 contracts from Open Zeppelin.
00:24:46.386 - 00:24:49.062, Speaker D: That are highly audited and secure and.
00:24:49.116 - 00:24:52.266, Speaker E: Put that on the blockchain and you will have an NFT that functions and.
00:24:52.288 - 00:24:59.786, Speaker D: Is secure and works. However, that is very different from this other functionality, which might be for the.
00:24:59.888 - 00:25:07.646, Speaker E: Initial primary sale of an NFT or like an initial drop which has different mechanics and all of a sudden you're collecting money.
00:25:07.748 - 00:25:09.806, Speaker D: You may have an auction mechanism, you.
00:25:09.828 - 00:25:14.826, Speaker E: Want civil resistance like Nosh was saying you don't want bots coming in and minting out an NFT before other people.
00:25:14.948 - 00:25:17.006, Speaker D: And you have all this extra functionality.
00:25:17.038 - 00:25:18.194, Speaker E: That'S really only used once.
00:25:18.232 - 00:25:26.242, Speaker D: Right? It's only used for this initial launch of the NFT and keeping those two things separate. So if we take for granted that.
00:25:26.296 - 00:25:29.766, Speaker E: The token and the ability to transfer it, that code is already audited, it.
00:25:29.788 - 00:25:34.418, Speaker D: Exists, that's there we can be sure that our tokens are going to be secure.
00:25:34.594 - 00:25:36.086, Speaker E: And then also we could maybe then.
00:25:36.108 - 00:25:40.466, Speaker D: Focus on the side of the actual Mint and the launch and where hacks.
00:25:40.498 - 00:25:42.182, Speaker E: And security vulnerabilities can happen.
00:25:42.236 - 00:25:44.458, Speaker D: There is like an interesting way to think about it.
00:25:44.544 - 00:25:44.842, Speaker F: Cool.
00:25:44.896 - 00:25:46.074, Speaker B: So let's break it down that way.
00:25:46.112 - 00:25:47.338, Speaker C: And you can actually leave off a.
00:25:47.344 - 00:25:50.858, Speaker B: Lot of details about auction design for Web three because for the listeners, in.
00:25:50.864 - 00:25:52.534, Speaker C: Case you missed it, we went deep.
00:25:52.582 - 00:25:59.038, Speaker B: Into incentive and mechanism and market design and more in episode three with Tim Roughgarden and Scott Commoners, if you want.
00:25:59.044 - 00:26:00.202, Speaker C: To check out that episode.
00:26:00.266 - 00:26:01.626, Speaker A: So take it away, Michael.
00:26:01.738 - 00:26:05.226, Speaker D: Okay, so let's focus on actually users.
00:26:05.258 - 00:26:12.034, Speaker E: Coming to your smart contract to mint an NFT. And this is also making an assumption that you're not selling this NFT on.
00:26:12.072 - 00:26:15.150, Speaker D: A third party marketplace that is totally centralized.
00:26:15.230 - 00:26:18.866, Speaker E: You're actually selling it directly through a smart contract, which is what a majority.
00:26:18.898 - 00:26:24.834, Speaker D: Of NFT Mints are using today. So you have a few issues here. For starters, I guess this is a big topic.
00:26:24.882 - 00:26:26.258, Speaker E: Let's talk about, like, bots.
00:26:26.354 - 00:26:32.054, Speaker D: Right? So let's say you have a ten k NFT project and you want the.
00:26:32.092 - 00:26:33.686, Speaker E: Ability for someone to mint.
00:26:33.718 - 00:26:37.162, Speaker D: Like each person can mint two, and that's about it.
00:26:37.216 - 00:26:39.754, Speaker E: Each person can mint two, and they're going to pay the smart contract money.
00:26:39.792 - 00:26:44.606, Speaker D: In order to mint two NFTs at a time. Now, that sounds pretty simple, but we.
00:26:44.628 - 00:26:46.014, Speaker E: Also know that there are a lot.
00:26:46.052 - 00:26:51.486, Speaker D: Of other components of the crypto ecosystem, such as Flashbots or Mev, where you.
00:26:51.508 - 00:26:53.518, Speaker E: Could have bots and miners coming in.
00:26:53.604 - 00:26:55.498, Speaker D: And front running other users.
00:26:55.594 - 00:26:57.794, Speaker E: And minting out NFTs before the actual.
00:26:57.832 - 00:26:59.922, Speaker D: Normal user who might be honest just.
00:26:59.976 - 00:27:02.466, Speaker E: Is going to come about and mint it through their MetaMask like they will.
00:27:02.488 - 00:27:04.482, Speaker D: Completely be beat out. Right, right.
00:27:04.536 - 00:27:06.194, Speaker A: How do you address this, by the way?
00:27:06.312 - 00:27:07.842, Speaker D: Well, there are a lot of ways.
00:27:07.896 - 00:27:09.238, Speaker E: And I'm just kind of talking about.
00:27:09.324 - 00:27:11.574, Speaker D: One mechanism for this.
00:27:11.692 - 00:27:15.286, Speaker E: But one is a situation where a user, when they mint an NFT to.
00:27:15.308 - 00:27:18.946, Speaker D: A smart contract, not only do they specify how many they want to purchase.
00:27:19.058 - 00:27:20.698, Speaker E: And of course send the amount of.
00:27:20.704 - 00:27:32.742, Speaker D: Money that they want to spend, but also they provide a cryptographic signature. And that cryptographic signature that is provided to the smart contract could only be generated by, let's say, the front end.
00:27:32.816 - 00:27:35.898, Speaker E: That a user might go to on their browser to mint the NFT.
00:27:36.074 - 00:27:47.826, Speaker D: And when you do this, you prevent bots who are just sitting in. The transaction, mem pool, watching things happen and trying to snipe NFT Mints who don't have any idea of what the website is.
00:27:47.928 - 00:27:49.282, Speaker E: They would never be able to actually.
00:27:49.336 - 00:27:54.386, Speaker D: Front run because they don't even know what that signature is, because they didn't even visit the website in the first place.
00:27:54.568 - 00:27:55.106, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:55.208 - 00:27:59.314, Speaker D: These are two things that you could do to prevent the bot.
00:27:59.362 - 00:28:00.886, Speaker E: Now on the whitelist side, obviously, when.
00:28:00.908 - 00:28:11.414, Speaker D: You have a whitelist and can only allow certain people to mint, that of course prevents bots from coming just by the simple nature that only a select set of addresses are allowed to come.
00:28:11.452 - 00:28:12.630, Speaker E: And mint an NFT.
00:28:12.790 - 00:28:14.346, Speaker D: But just like this idea that a.
00:28:14.368 - 00:28:17.542, Speaker E: Bot could come in and capture a lot of the volume of an NFT.
00:28:17.686 - 00:28:19.738, Speaker D: Is really dangerous because now you have.
00:28:19.744 - 00:28:21.798, Speaker E: The situation where a bot might accumulate.
00:28:21.894 - 00:28:26.474, Speaker D: Like hundreds of NFTs, which could be a huge percentage of the supply, immediately.
00:28:26.522 - 00:28:28.542, Speaker E: Turn around on a secondary market and dump them.
00:28:28.596 - 00:28:29.774, Speaker D: And all of a sudden it just.
00:28:29.812 - 00:28:31.726, Speaker E: Creates this really bad way to start.
00:28:31.748 - 00:28:33.006, Speaker D: Off of building a community.
00:28:33.188 - 00:28:37.406, Speaker G: We've actually seen bote ruin quite a few drops. Right there.
00:28:37.428 - 00:28:39.282, Speaker F: Was kind of like the botting through.
00:28:39.336 - 00:28:41.554, Speaker G: Smart contracts as Minters, that you basically.
00:28:41.592 - 00:28:43.778, Speaker F: Have smart contracts that themselves create a.
00:28:43.784 - 00:28:46.098, Speaker G: Bunch of addresses, send funds to them.
00:28:46.184 - 00:28:52.086, Speaker F: And then have all of them send transactions to Mint. And you basically have now like a.
00:28:52.108 - 00:28:58.646, Speaker G: Single smart contract that manages to mint 300, 400, 500, NFTs plus, or you.
00:28:58.668 - 00:29:02.022, Speaker F: Have actual accounts that can mint directly.
00:29:02.086 - 00:29:12.190, Speaker G: To the contract without going to a back end. And so this is like an interesting trade off because now you're making the Mint more expensive to every single security.
00:29:12.260 - 00:29:15.630, Speaker F: Feature that you're adding, you're actually also.
00:29:15.700 - 00:29:19.514, Speaker G: Increasing the complexity of the user experience throughout the Mint.
00:29:19.562 - 00:29:24.298, Speaker F: Or it could be, even from a financial standpoint, the amount of gas fees that people pay.
00:29:24.404 - 00:29:33.502, Speaker G: And so I think that try to hit the right trade off is often a bit hard, even including web two to secure a drop, then you're forcing.
00:29:33.566 - 00:29:36.754, Speaker F: Them to basically either authenticate or just.
00:29:36.792 - 00:29:38.790, Speaker G: Prove that they're an actual human being.
00:29:38.860 - 00:29:41.718, Speaker F: So there's going to be captcha, verification and so on.
00:29:41.804 - 00:29:48.086, Speaker G: And all of these things actually do add quite a bit of friction. So it is pretty important as a.
00:29:48.108 - 00:29:59.302, Speaker F: Creator to not scare people away either. A lot of people will understand that it's for their own benefit, but actually do hate the idea of having to go through plenty of hoops.
00:29:59.446 - 00:30:08.974, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. Just a quick note, Nas, on your point about the trade off. When you were at Facebook, you actually were really responsible for thinking about these.
00:30:09.012 - 00:30:11.406, Speaker C: Systems at a larger scale, for what.
00:30:11.428 - 00:30:21.314, Speaker A: It takes to bring many, many users onto something. Do you have any philosophical mindset here about what kinds of trade offs? Because there are always trade offs that.
00:30:21.352 - 00:30:23.026, Speaker C: You kind of have to make when.
00:30:23.048 - 00:30:26.306, Speaker A: It comes to thinking about designing these systems for scale.
00:30:26.498 - 00:30:28.614, Speaker F: Yeah, people will look for always the.
00:30:28.652 - 00:30:33.720, Speaker G: Shortest path, the path of least resistance, always. That's just human.
00:30:34.090 - 00:30:41.894, Speaker F: And because NFTs are social networks, accessing the social network of NFTs is really no different from accessing Facebook.
00:30:42.022 - 00:30:48.186, Speaker G: Right? And so if you're making the onboarding to Facebook complex or in the case.
00:30:48.208 - 00:30:49.562, Speaker F: Of the system that I worked on.
00:30:49.616 - 00:30:51.466, Speaker G: The nobi wallet, if you're making it.
00:30:51.488 - 00:30:58.814, Speaker F: Too complex, people will actually decide to not join this social network and go for another system, another platform, right?
00:30:58.932 - 00:30:59.454, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:30:59.572 - 00:31:02.542, Speaker F: It's a game of incentives and also a game of education.
00:31:02.676 - 00:31:02.974, Speaker D: Right?
00:31:03.012 - 00:31:07.954, Speaker F: You have to basically educate people, proactively very clearly, explaining all these things to.
00:31:07.992 - 00:31:13.986, Speaker G: People, will bring them with you along in the process, explaining to them why.
00:31:14.088 - 00:31:16.926, Speaker F: Is it that you do what you are doing, why is it that you're.
00:31:16.958 - 00:31:19.118, Speaker G: Forcing them to take some steps.
00:31:19.214 - 00:31:22.038, Speaker F: And you also have to make it clear that it's a one time thing.
00:31:22.124 - 00:31:25.174, Speaker G: And that this is not going to be happening again.
00:31:25.212 - 00:31:29.254, Speaker F: But you really have to make that process clear even before they go through.
00:31:29.292 - 00:31:31.286, Speaker G: The experience that it's for their own.
00:31:31.308 - 00:31:35.322, Speaker F: Benefit, for the community around them, for the friends that they could have also.
00:31:35.376 - 00:31:38.710, Speaker G: In the community joining them as part of the social network.
00:31:38.870 - 00:31:40.378, Speaker D: The only thing that I'll add is.
00:31:40.464 - 00:31:44.714, Speaker E: Like we mentioned the beginning, NFTs are images, they're JPEGs, they're videos, very static.
00:31:44.842 - 00:31:47.518, Speaker D: And I think that as we develop.
00:31:47.604 - 00:31:52.094, Speaker E: That category of NFTs that are more dynamic and have more functionality other than.
00:31:52.132 - 00:31:54.446, Speaker D: Simply a PFP or an image, I.
00:31:54.468 - 00:31:58.514, Speaker E: Think that the actual smart contract functionality that is going to be required to.
00:31:58.552 - 00:32:01.074, Speaker D: Enable all those new features is also.
00:32:01.112 - 00:32:08.466, Speaker E: Going to be another component of security risk and that needs to be audited. Right. So it's not just this initial Mint anymore. As we increase the complexity of what.
00:32:08.488 - 00:32:11.862, Speaker D: These assets can do, that's only going to increase the issue.
00:32:11.916 - 00:32:12.406, Speaker E: And you know what?
00:32:12.428 - 00:32:14.326, Speaker D: Maybe that has to do with if.
00:32:14.348 - 00:32:15.574, Speaker E: You have like an NFT, for example.
00:32:15.612 - 00:32:17.794, Speaker D: That in theory should be non transferable.
00:32:17.842 - 00:32:19.798, Speaker E: But yet it is transferable that could.
00:32:19.884 - 00:32:26.614, Speaker D: Really ruin a you know, I think we often talk a lot. Of times about situations where an NFT.
00:32:26.662 - 00:32:30.426, Speaker E: Could be non transferable or soul bound, or an NFT is owned as you.
00:32:30.448 - 00:32:32.570, Speaker D: Would expect it to, only you're allowed to trade it.
00:32:32.640 - 00:32:34.358, Speaker E: But imagine a situation on the other.
00:32:34.384 - 00:32:36.286, Speaker D: End of the spectrum where of course.
00:32:36.308 - 00:32:39.978, Speaker E: We'Ve seen scenarios where you sign a malicious message in MetaMask and then someone's.
00:32:39.994 - 00:32:44.074, Speaker D: Able to actually swipe NFTs out of your wallet, but at a smart contract.
00:32:44.122 - 00:32:51.426, Speaker E: Level without even assigned a message. If there is a vulnerability in a smart contract that actually allows you to pull or remove an NFT out of.
00:32:51.448 - 00:32:53.506, Speaker D: Someone else's wallet is pretty important.
00:32:53.608 - 00:32:58.514, Speaker E: And where this gets really interesting is there's this component of Minting NFTs where.
00:32:58.632 - 00:33:00.454, Speaker D: We always look at provenance and how.
00:33:00.492 - 00:33:03.650, Speaker E: Important that is of who owns what and who transferred what to whom.
00:33:03.810 - 00:33:07.510, Speaker D: And we assume that when we go on a marketplace and we look at.
00:33:07.580 - 00:33:11.366, Speaker E: The history of ownership that it's true and honest. And this is actually from the blockchain.
00:33:11.478 - 00:33:13.466, Speaker D: But in reality, under the hood, the.
00:33:13.488 - 00:33:17.178, Speaker E: Way that third party marketplaces are able to pull that data and display it.
00:33:17.184 - 00:33:19.706, Speaker D: To you as the user is through.
00:33:19.808 - 00:33:21.962, Speaker E: From a technical side, events or event.
00:33:22.016 - 00:33:33.338, Speaker D: Logs that are emitted from the blockchain and these event logs can be manipulated. And you could have situations where a smart contract mint that you might see on a marketplace will show famous influencers.
00:33:33.354 - 00:33:34.522, Speaker E: Are making this NFT.
00:33:34.666 - 00:33:37.838, Speaker D: And someone will look at that and be like, oh my God, this is.
00:33:37.844 - 00:33:39.746, Speaker E: A really popular NFT. I have to get in on it.
00:33:39.768 - 00:33:41.198, Speaker D: I have to buy it, I have to rush.
00:33:41.294 - 00:33:45.822, Speaker E: And all of a sudden, it's completely fraudulent and these people are not actually making this asset.
00:33:45.886 - 00:33:50.742, Speaker D: And it's all just based on smart contract manipulation. And it's just to steal your money.
00:33:50.876 - 00:33:54.038, Speaker E: And that's a whole other side of this extra functionality that could be in.
00:33:54.044 - 00:33:58.566, Speaker D: The smart contract above and beyond the token that could be pretty harmful to.
00:33:58.588 - 00:34:00.374, Speaker E: Users and we see it happen quite often.
00:34:00.492 - 00:34:01.666, Speaker A: I know this is a big topic.
00:34:01.698 - 00:34:02.906, Speaker C: But just a quick note before we.
00:34:02.928 - 00:34:03.930, Speaker A: Move on to more.
00:34:04.080 - 00:34:10.620, Speaker C: Is there a solution right now, or is it still being worked out to help prevent that exact scenario you just mentioned?
00:34:11.070 - 00:34:13.534, Speaker E: Unfortunately, there actually really isn't a good.
00:34:13.572 - 00:34:19.742, Speaker D: Solution outside of different marketplaces taking the necessary steps to detect these sorts of things.
00:34:19.796 - 00:34:20.922, Speaker E: And they are detectable.
00:34:20.986 - 00:34:25.434, Speaker D: I did write a blog about this thing called NFT Sleep Minting, which has to do with this topic.
00:34:25.562 - 00:34:27.234, Speaker E: And it's something that a marketplace can.
00:34:27.272 - 00:34:32.962, Speaker D: Detect or a block explorer like Etherscan could detect and display them to the yeah.
00:34:33.096 - 00:34:34.386, Speaker C: Is there anything else you'd add at.
00:34:34.408 - 00:34:42.774, Speaker B: This know, other nuances evolving the evolution besides the transition from static to dynamic that Michael was just talking about nas that you would add know, some other.
00:34:42.812 - 00:34:44.658, Speaker A: Aspect, anything we're missing?
00:34:44.834 - 00:35:04.026, Speaker F: Yeah, there is like another thing. As we start having these bigger projects that have several collections to them and the requirements to access a certain drop is basically ownership of assets from the previous collection. I want to meet the mutants, but the only way for me to mint a mutant ape is if I have a board ape.
00:35:04.058 - 00:35:04.398, Speaker E: Right?
00:35:04.484 - 00:35:06.366, Speaker G: And so one thing that we want.
00:35:06.388 - 00:35:10.382, Speaker F: To also have is allowing people to keep their assets as much as possible.
00:35:10.436 - 00:35:21.858, Speaker G: In their cold wallets. So one thing that I would love to see is more standardization efforts around being able to mint from a hot wallet into a cold wallet that you own.
00:35:21.944 - 00:35:23.006, Speaker D: I wish I could applaud.
00:35:23.038 - 00:35:24.210, Speaker E: I want to applaud right now.
00:35:24.280 - 00:35:28.562, Speaker A: Applaud out loud, make the sound, insert.
00:35:28.626 - 00:35:32.754, Speaker D: Sound effect here, keep going, but decoupling.
00:35:32.802 - 00:35:40.266, Speaker F: Basically the address that mints from the recipient is going to be critical in the future. We really need to start working on.
00:35:40.288 - 00:35:46.666, Speaker G: Standardization efforts around this decoupling because everything that we're doing right now is going.
00:35:46.688 - 00:35:52.986, Speaker F: To define the way people interact with NFTs in the future, the way people want to access experiences.
00:35:53.098 - 00:35:56.142, Speaker G: And right now there is no decoupling. Right.
00:35:56.196 - 00:36:00.590, Speaker F: You need to have basically to move say, your four Dave or anything into.
00:36:00.740 - 00:36:04.942, Speaker G: The wallet that is going to Mint, put it online, do the Mint, and.
00:36:04.996 - 00:36:12.450, Speaker F: Potentially do a malicious action and then send it back to your, quote, wallet. And so all these things are going to be critical to tackle in the months to come.
00:36:12.520 - 00:36:16.654, Speaker C: Right? And just to be clear, for those who don't know, obviously the difference between a hot wallet and a cold wallet.
00:36:16.702 - 00:36:17.586, Speaker A: At a high level.
00:36:17.688 - 00:36:20.514, Speaker C: Obviously a hot wallet is really the one that's connected to the internet.
00:36:20.562 - 00:36:25.522, Speaker A: Cold wallet being something that's literally just kind of disconnected and separate.
00:36:25.586 - 00:36:35.990, Speaker C: And the best practice is to obviously try to move anything that's valuable and not in frequent rotation or use for daily activities into your cold wallet as it's the default.
00:36:36.070 - 00:36:37.546, Speaker A: But not everybody has that level of.
00:36:37.568 - 00:36:39.866, Speaker C: Sophistication, let alone have any of that set up.
00:36:39.888 - 00:36:41.742, Speaker A: And what you're arguing Nas, is that.
00:36:41.796 - 00:36:45.866, Speaker C: Platforms, standards, bodies, various participants, makers, creators.
00:36:45.978 - 00:36:48.478, Speaker A: Can all help these standards come about.
00:36:48.564 - 00:36:50.366, Speaker C: By simply helping users kind of do.
00:36:50.388 - 00:36:54.222, Speaker A: This as a best practice by the features and functionality they've built.
00:36:54.356 - 00:36:55.086, Speaker G: That's correct.
00:36:55.188 - 00:36:58.626, Speaker F: And having that as part of the smart contract itself is going to be.
00:36:58.648 - 00:37:02.018, Speaker G: Critical to ensure the best safety of everyone in this space.
00:37:02.104 - 00:37:03.746, Speaker F: And I'm talking about Minting, but in.
00:37:03.768 - 00:37:07.330, Speaker G: Reality it's any type of access, any type of action, right?
00:37:07.400 - 00:37:08.486, Speaker F: You should be able to stake on.
00:37:08.508 - 00:37:09.958, Speaker D: Behalf of another address.
00:37:10.044 - 00:37:17.046, Speaker F: You should be able to access whichever party and events or unlock certain content. There is going to be more and.
00:37:17.068 - 00:37:21.990, Speaker G: More actions that you're going to be able to do because you own a specific NFT.
00:37:22.150 - 00:37:23.514, Speaker F: This is kind of like this idea.
00:37:23.552 - 00:37:25.622, Speaker G: Of token gated experiences.
00:37:25.766 - 00:37:29.430, Speaker F: And so decoupling the two is going to be really critical.
00:37:29.510 - 00:37:31.878, Speaker G: But the Mint is where it starts.
00:37:31.974 - 00:37:35.162, Speaker F: This is where we should probably start. And we're going to have the easiest.
00:37:35.226 - 00:37:39.070, Speaker G: Way decoupling these two, the addresses that.
00:37:39.220 - 00:37:40.974, Speaker F: Perform the action from the ones that.
00:37:41.012 - 00:37:42.458, Speaker G: Actually store the asset.
00:37:42.554 - 00:37:55.246, Speaker D: Wait, not so you know how sometimes before the Mint, if you go to the smart contract, there are a lot of approvals, like set approval for and things like that? Well, just like to give context for anyone who's unaware, part of the ERC.
00:37:55.278 - 00:37:57.090, Speaker E: Seven to one standard is the ability.
00:37:57.250 - 00:38:00.370, Speaker D: For you as a user to delegate.
00:38:00.530 - 00:38:04.370, Speaker E: Another address to transfer your NFT on your behalf.
00:38:04.450 - 00:38:06.406, Speaker D: Right, so like I'm just thinking in.
00:38:06.428 - 00:38:07.778, Speaker E: My head now I could imagine, let's.
00:38:07.794 - 00:38:09.426, Speaker D: Say I know I have my cold.
00:38:09.458 - 00:38:15.162, Speaker E: Wallet, that I actually want to hold my NFT before an NFT Mint happens, I'll make a new wallet that's completely.
00:38:15.216 - 00:38:18.650, Speaker D: Detached from everything else. I'd go to the Smart Contract, pre.
00:38:18.720 - 00:38:21.354, Speaker E: Approve my other wallet to transfer any.
00:38:21.392 - 00:38:26.586, Speaker D: NFT I own from this contract at a later point in time. And now I can go and Mint.
00:38:26.618 - 00:38:28.334, Speaker E: As usual from an address that might.
00:38:28.372 - 00:38:30.138, Speaker D: Not necessarily even be on a whitelist.
00:38:30.234 - 00:38:32.046, Speaker E: As long as what's approved is on.
00:38:32.068 - 00:38:35.194, Speaker D: The whitelist to transfer later. And then of course, as gas dies.
00:38:35.242 - 00:38:40.222, Speaker E: Down and all this stuff, I can go reclaim that NFT from the correct address and the Cold wallet address later on.
00:38:40.276 - 00:38:41.166, Speaker D: But I don't know, I'm just thinking.
00:38:41.188 - 00:38:42.046, Speaker E: About that in my head right now.
00:38:42.068 - 00:38:43.498, Speaker D: It's a potential method.
00:38:43.594 - 00:38:46.134, Speaker F: Yeah, the way I was thinking about it is actually making it a one.
00:38:46.172 - 00:39:04.906, Speaker G: Time thing, just like you registering an ENS, basically having a single central location where your address can actually say this other address can do these. Things for me, including Mint, including staking, including some other actions and doing that as a one time and for the.
00:39:04.928 - 00:39:07.594, Speaker F: Blockchain to be able to register your.
00:39:07.712 - 00:39:09.622, Speaker G: Preferences and your permission.
00:39:09.686 - 00:39:12.918, Speaker F: And it wouldn't necessarily need to be per contract basis.
00:39:13.014 - 00:39:18.990, Speaker E: So like, are you telling me that this weekend we're going to go make the Minting Permissions Registry?
00:39:19.410 - 00:39:21.022, Speaker F: That is exactly what we're going to.
00:39:21.076 - 00:39:22.478, Speaker G: Work on, michael, I hope you don't.
00:39:22.484 - 00:39:23.434, Speaker F: Have anything else played.
00:39:23.482 - 00:39:25.822, Speaker C: I love it live and conceived on.
00:39:25.876 - 00:39:29.438, Speaker A: Air, this new product that will come out right after this podcast.
00:39:29.614 - 00:39:32.094, Speaker C: I want to just point out something you mentioned very briefly.
00:39:32.142 - 00:39:34.098, Speaker A: Nas like this is useful when you.
00:39:34.104 - 00:39:36.638, Speaker C: Think about token gated experiences and the.
00:39:36.664 - 00:39:38.806, Speaker A: Idea again here being there is a.
00:39:38.828 - 00:39:42.438, Speaker C: Way for NFTs to represent so much more. It's community building.
00:39:42.604 - 00:39:48.646, Speaker A: It's the ability to unlock experiences in the real world, physical world as well as online.
00:39:48.748 - 00:39:51.570, Speaker C: It could be attending an event, it could be connected to identity, it could.
00:39:51.580 - 00:39:52.838, Speaker A: Be connected to gaming.
00:39:52.934 - 00:39:54.314, Speaker C: So what you guys are actually talking.
00:39:54.352 - 00:39:58.538, Speaker A: About has significance well beyond just this kind of wonky question of how do.
00:39:58.544 - 00:39:59.722, Speaker C: We secure so and so?
00:39:59.776 - 00:40:02.374, Speaker A: I just wanted to underscore that because it's actually quite significant.
00:40:02.502 - 00:40:03.454, Speaker G: That's a very good point.
00:40:03.492 - 00:40:05.358, Speaker F: I think that gaming is the most important one.
00:40:05.444 - 00:40:11.210, Speaker G: Every single project is eyeing towards some form of experiences, digital experiences.
00:40:11.290 - 00:40:13.122, Speaker F: You don't want to have your most.
00:40:13.176 - 00:40:16.306, Speaker G: Valuable assets plugged into your computer that.
00:40:16.328 - 00:40:22.210, Speaker F: Is actually running a game, right. That is constantly exchanging information with untrusted networks, right.
00:40:22.280 - 00:40:24.530, Speaker C: Sometimes thousands of players as well.
00:40:24.600 - 00:40:25.540, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:40:25.910 - 00:40:27.358, Speaker F: And so you end up in this.
00:40:27.384 - 00:40:29.702, Speaker G: Situation where you need to have this.
00:40:29.836 - 00:40:33.250, Speaker F: System of permission so that your assets.
00:40:33.330 - 00:40:39.042, Speaker G: Are safe somewhere, but there is some form of delegation of permissions to whichever.
00:40:39.106 - 00:40:41.226, Speaker F: System you're using to actually perform the.
00:40:41.248 - 00:40:47.238, Speaker G: Actions, perform the interactions with the systems and still enjoy it as a holder, as a stakeholder.
00:40:47.334 - 00:40:49.786, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. Okay, so really quickly before we move.
00:40:49.808 - 00:40:51.594, Speaker A: Off the Smart Contract thing, is there.
00:40:51.632 - 00:40:53.790, Speaker C: More to say then on what people.
00:40:53.860 - 00:40:58.254, Speaker A: Should whether it's a person, whether the party is a person, a creator, or.
00:40:58.292 - 00:41:00.606, Speaker C: A marketplace, or anyone else who's kind.
00:41:00.628 - 00:41:05.378, Speaker A: Of creating interactions between these smart contracts, what else can be done?
00:41:05.544 - 00:41:11.602, Speaker F: Yeah, I think that's one thing that every single person deploying smart contracts should.
00:41:11.656 - 00:41:23.586, Speaker G: Really seek security expertise in order to perform security audits. Especially as you start using as a creator, as you start using custom logic.
00:41:23.698 - 00:41:25.586, Speaker F: In your smart contract that is non.
00:41:25.618 - 00:41:29.094, Speaker G: Standard, it is essential for you to.
00:41:29.132 - 00:41:31.318, Speaker F: Have these things reviewed by experts in.
00:41:31.324 - 00:41:33.034, Speaker G: The space who can tell you this.
00:41:33.072 - 00:41:34.218, Speaker F: Is not going to work, there is.
00:41:34.224 - 00:41:39.978, Speaker G: Going to be a bug here and so on. And we've seen NFT drops having big issues.
00:41:40.144 - 00:41:44.718, Speaker F: One of them was actually trying to perform a Dutch auction with a last clearing price.
00:41:44.804 - 00:41:46.826, Speaker G: And so intending to do the Dutch.
00:41:46.858 - 00:41:50.622, Speaker F: Auction refund, everyone plugged the difference between.
00:41:50.676 - 00:41:59.890, Speaker G: Whichever bid was made and the last bidding price. And actually there was a bug at this level and the entire primary cell.
00:41:59.960 - 00:42:02.622, Speaker F: Ended up being locked within the smart contract.
00:42:02.766 - 00:42:13.474, Speaker G: And so it is critical to keep in mind that as creators, you are responsible for not just the tokens, but the money that flows through the smart contract.
00:42:13.602 - 00:42:26.298, Speaker F: Do not hesitate to seek security expertise in the space. A lot of people will do it for free, some of them will expect something in exchange. But it is critical for you to really perform security audits, especially of the.
00:42:26.304 - 00:42:28.662, Speaker G: Parts that are pretty custom and bespoke.
00:42:28.806 - 00:42:30.874, Speaker D: Yeah, even if for whatever reason, maybe.
00:42:30.992 - 00:42:34.366, Speaker E: You can't afford an audit or it's too expensive, or the timeline doesn't fit.
00:42:34.388 - 00:42:37.386, Speaker D: Your project's timeline, even just the steps.
00:42:37.418 - 00:42:39.566, Speaker E: Of open sourcing your contracts beforehand and.
00:42:39.588 - 00:42:41.706, Speaker D: Letting the community look at them, there's.
00:42:41.738 - 00:42:42.894, Speaker E: Someone nice out there that can point.
00:42:42.932 - 00:42:44.382, Speaker D: Something out to you if there's a problem.
00:42:44.516 - 00:42:52.042, Speaker C: That's a wonderful point because to me, the entire point of this world and movement of Web Three is this democratization of creation.
00:42:52.186 - 00:42:53.806, Speaker A: And I like the idea that you.
00:42:53.828 - 00:43:07.238, Speaker C: Don'T have to have elite knowledge to be able to do certain things. And right now a lot of this stuff is an abstracted away in a way that's plug and play for a lot of creators. It sometimes means you have to rely on an existing network. You have to either know smart security folks who can do this, whereas I.
00:43:07.244 - 00:43:10.566, Speaker A: Don'T think every single person has access to that. Do you think there's going to be.
00:43:10.588 - 00:43:16.282, Speaker C: A movement where platforms will help provide this or there will be a whole ecosystem of these services spring up?
00:43:16.416 - 00:43:17.578, Speaker D: Oh, 100%.
00:43:17.664 - 00:43:17.818, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:43:17.824 - 00:43:22.334, Speaker E: And you already see this happening. So like Manifold, for example, you don't have to know how to code at all.
00:43:22.372 - 00:43:24.094, Speaker D: You can go to their platform, they.
00:43:24.132 - 00:43:29.806, Speaker E: Already have audited secure, safe smart contracts for creating a variety of types of.
00:43:29.828 - 00:43:36.254, Speaker D: NFTs that is very easy for anyone to use. And all you got to do is pay any gas fee on the blockchain.
00:43:36.302 - 00:43:37.314, Speaker G: To actually do that.
00:43:37.432 - 00:43:44.066, Speaker D: But with that said, what Manifold does that's really interesting here is that I know we've been talking about NFTs that.
00:43:44.088 - 00:43:45.726, Speaker E: Have this extended functionality.
00:43:45.838 - 00:43:47.538, Speaker D: Well, in the base case you can.
00:43:47.544 - 00:43:48.966, Speaker E: Go to manifold and just mint an.
00:43:48.988 - 00:44:01.122, Speaker D: Image but they also are building the ability for people to have these plug and play extensions that you can tack onto your smart contracts which are themselves are also audited and actually do this.
00:44:01.196 - 00:44:03.466, Speaker E: Extending of functionality and expand the use.
00:44:03.488 - 00:44:06.726, Speaker D: Case of your NFTs. And this is a sort of user.
00:44:06.758 - 00:44:11.478, Speaker E: Interface that doesn't require any coding knowledge at all. So you do see it happening very slowly.
00:44:11.574 - 00:44:12.846, Speaker C: Well, honestly, it makes me think of.
00:44:12.868 - 00:44:18.590, Speaker A: The API economy in general and the whole movement post twilio, post stripe, because.
00:44:18.660 - 00:44:25.606, Speaker C: All these things exist in different APIs. Builders can essentially create the product they want and focus on their key core.
00:44:25.738 - 00:44:29.266, Speaker A: Skill or creativity or craft, because they.
00:44:29.288 - 00:44:31.682, Speaker C: Can draw on all the smartness from the absolute best.
00:44:31.736 - 00:44:33.506, Speaker A: Because there's no way, for instance, a.
00:44:33.528 - 00:44:37.458, Speaker C: Small retailer in the middle of a particular region has access to necessarily the.
00:44:37.464 - 00:44:39.346, Speaker A: Best coding expertise in the world, but.
00:44:39.368 - 00:44:45.958, Speaker C: They certainly can access it if they're using like an API from a certain company. And so to me, it's a very democratizing to create and combine all these.
00:44:46.044 - 00:44:48.838, Speaker A: Lego blocks to essentially make the thing you want.
00:44:49.004 - 00:44:51.210, Speaker F: I think that it was Naval that said it best.
00:44:51.280 - 00:44:54.890, Speaker G: Open source means that each problem only needs to be solved once.
00:44:54.960 - 00:44:55.242, Speaker F: Right?
00:44:55.296 - 00:44:56.410, Speaker A: Oh, that's a great line.
00:44:56.480 - 00:44:59.638, Speaker F: It really applies directly to smart contracts.
00:44:59.734 - 00:45:00.378, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:00.544 - 00:45:04.570, Speaker F: When you're thinking about the type of interactions that you're allowing as a creator.
00:45:04.650 - 00:45:12.762, Speaker G: Between the holder and the smart contract, all these things are problems that need to be solved. And a lot of people will experiment.
00:45:12.826 - 00:45:14.814, Speaker F: And try to come up with a solution.
00:45:14.942 - 00:45:17.202, Speaker G: But the open source art really means.
00:45:17.256 - 00:45:23.806, Speaker F: That people can work together on tackling this problem. Increasing the safety of this building block.
00:45:23.838 - 00:45:24.226, Speaker G: Right.
00:45:24.328 - 00:45:28.942, Speaker F: To build this castle of experiences is going to be critical totally.
00:45:29.006 - 00:45:32.866, Speaker C: The ability to draw on the very best and the community, like further hacking.
00:45:32.898 - 00:45:35.590, Speaker A: Away at something is the ethos of Web Three.
00:45:35.660 - 00:45:37.670, Speaker C: Okay, so these all kind of blend into each other.
00:45:37.740 - 00:45:41.606, Speaker A: We talked about the Mint and a little bit about the drop and is.
00:45:41.628 - 00:45:43.670, Speaker C: There anything to add on the Reveal or anything else?
00:45:43.740 - 00:45:45.418, Speaker A: Do we miss any aspect on the.
00:45:45.424 - 00:45:46.666, Speaker C: Security side that we need to talk.
00:45:46.688 - 00:45:48.406, Speaker A: About when it comes to the primary sale?
00:45:48.518 - 00:45:51.358, Speaker F: So, on the Reveal side, there are many things there.
00:45:51.444 - 00:45:54.522, Speaker G: So first and foremost, there are techniques.
00:45:54.666 - 00:45:57.246, Speaker F: It's not really security per se, but.
00:45:57.268 - 00:46:01.034, Speaker G: It'S just preventing making sure that users.
00:46:01.082 - 00:46:03.714, Speaker F: Have the ability to verify that the.
00:46:03.752 - 00:46:07.426, Speaker G: Creators didn't tamper with the ordering or.
00:46:07.448 - 00:46:11.026, Speaker F: The attribution mechanisms of the assets themselves.
00:46:11.128 - 00:46:16.822, Speaker G: Right. The more rare, the most valuable, and so on. And so there are some techniques around.
00:46:16.876 - 00:46:21.382, Speaker F: That but on the reveal side, we're kind of like stuck with people who.
00:46:21.516 - 00:46:29.674, Speaker G: Basically monitor the mempool for the reveal data even before this reveal data is.
00:46:29.712 - 00:46:33.862, Speaker F: Available for the users that are just watching Marketplaces.
00:46:33.926 - 00:46:44.746, Speaker G: So the way it works is that within the smart contract, you have a way to look up the metadata associated to any token, any NFT, and say.
00:46:44.768 - 00:46:46.422, Speaker F: That it's done with like two phases.
00:46:46.486 - 00:46:54.898, Speaker G: So pre reveal, every single token is going to have the same metadata that is not going to be the final one. And post reveal, each token is going.
00:46:54.904 - 00:46:56.946, Speaker F: To have their own metadata which is.
00:46:56.968 - 00:46:57.954, Speaker G: Going to be final.
00:46:58.152 - 00:47:03.170, Speaker F: And so there is this interesting part in between where the creators are actually.
00:47:03.240 - 00:47:09.250, Speaker G: Publishing the new location, the lookup for the final metadata.
00:47:09.330 - 00:47:15.174, Speaker F: So it's basically updating the information on the blockchain to basically say like, hey, now if you want to go look.
00:47:15.212 - 00:47:17.254, Speaker G: Up the data, it's located at this.
00:47:17.292 - 00:47:20.534, Speaker F: URL, it's located at this location on.
00:47:20.572 - 00:47:32.042, Speaker G: Rweep, on IPFS, on web servers and so on. And so there is like an interesting race condition that is happening there, which is the creators, when they publish it.
00:47:32.096 - 00:47:38.958, Speaker F: This information is actually available for miners basically, and people monitoring the medpool. But because it is not on the.
00:47:38.964 - 00:47:40.814, Speaker G: Blockchain, it is not published, it is.
00:47:40.852 - 00:47:44.662, Speaker F: Not available to anyone except the people who are monitoring the medpool.
00:47:44.746 - 00:47:45.380, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:47:45.750 - 00:47:56.114, Speaker G: And so there is this critical moment where some actors actually gain information about the revealed data before everyone asks and can potentially scoop things that are for.
00:47:56.152 - 00:48:01.650, Speaker F: Sale still like unrevealed on the marketplace. And so we also need to improve the security of this mechanism.
00:48:01.730 - 00:48:02.694, Speaker C: And do you have like a one.
00:48:02.732 - 00:48:05.590, Speaker A: Line summary of what the solution there is?
00:48:05.740 - 00:48:11.354, Speaker F: So actually there is no really right answer. The right answer is oftentimes to actually.
00:48:11.392 - 00:48:14.426, Speaker G: Either reveal the information separately from the.
00:48:14.448 - 00:48:16.010, Speaker F: Blockchain and try to make it available.
00:48:16.080 - 00:48:19.034, Speaker G: To everyone, not through a blockchain, but.
00:48:19.072 - 00:48:29.294, Speaker F: Actually make it available through websites and so on, and then transition after the metadata is revealed. Transition to this blockchain so that people can know ahead of time what they.
00:48:29.332 - 00:48:32.458, Speaker G: Have without it being available first to the miners.
00:48:32.554 - 00:48:32.910, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:32.980 - 00:48:36.030, Speaker F: The people looking at the men pool, but to make it available to everyone.
00:48:36.100 - 00:48:37.506, Speaker G: At the same time, which also then.
00:48:37.528 - 00:48:45.566, Speaker C: Takes care of the asymmetry problem of the information as well as the ability for bots and people watching that detail that is not revealed in the marketplaces.
00:48:45.678 - 00:48:46.866, Speaker A: And trying to arbitrage that.
00:48:46.888 - 00:48:47.878, Speaker C: That makes so much sense.
00:48:47.964 - 00:48:48.406, Speaker F: Exactly.
00:48:48.508 - 00:48:51.586, Speaker C: Michael, is there anything more that you would add on the drop reveal mint.
00:48:51.618 - 00:48:54.680, Speaker A: Side before we move on to the secondary part?
00:48:55.050 - 00:48:57.574, Speaker D: Yeah, right after the reveal. Right.
00:48:57.612 - 00:49:00.534, Speaker E: So now you have all these assets that are revealed and everyone's enjoying them.
00:49:00.572 - 00:49:02.026, Speaker D: And everyone's loving to look at their.
00:49:02.048 - 00:49:03.658, Speaker E: Board apes and whatnot and it's all.
00:49:03.664 - 00:49:07.642, Speaker D: Happy and it's all great. We still have to remember that this.
00:49:07.696 - 00:49:10.442, Speaker E: Media file this image, this metadata is.
00:49:10.496 - 00:49:19.598, Speaker D: Stored not on the blockchain for the most part. It's stored on some other decentralized, hopefully decentralized storage solution. And this is more of like a.
00:49:19.604 - 00:49:22.670, Speaker E: Philosophical idea than a security thing, but it could very well be a security.
00:49:22.740 - 00:49:27.998, Speaker D: Thing where I think this idea that blockchains are immutable has created the illusion.
00:49:28.094 - 00:49:30.306, Speaker E: That NFTs are immutable and images are.
00:49:30.328 - 00:49:33.554, Speaker D: Immutable, when in reality, most of the.
00:49:33.592 - 00:49:35.586, Speaker E: Time, if not all the time.
00:49:35.768 - 00:49:37.234, Speaker D: I don't even know why this idea.
00:49:37.272 - 00:49:41.478, Speaker E: That NFT images should be immutable has ever even been a thing. Because for the most part, I don't.
00:49:41.484 - 00:49:58.150, Speaker D: Think it's ever been the case. Is that the creator of a smart contract does have the ability, unless they program it otherwise, to update where this media is stored off chain. Or at least change where the token ID points to off chain.
00:49:58.230 - 00:49:59.306, Speaker E: Maybe they want it to point to.
00:49:59.328 - 00:50:05.006, Speaker D: A centralized server, maybe they want to point to a dive PFS or Arweave. And when you think about that, the.
00:50:05.028 - 00:50:08.558, Speaker E: Creator does actually have that ability. And whether it's a good thing or.
00:50:08.564 - 00:50:10.186, Speaker D: A bad thing is for another discussion.
00:50:10.298 - 00:50:15.194, Speaker E: There's certainly a component of risk there from two sides. One, it's the ability for a creator.
00:50:15.242 - 00:50:17.010, Speaker D: To completely change everything.
00:50:17.080 - 00:50:20.306, Speaker E: Like you could imagine I do my NFT project and then one day I.
00:50:20.328 - 00:50:22.514, Speaker D: Decide to change the images to all.
00:50:22.552 - 00:50:27.486, Speaker E: Be a smiley face and say goodbye. That's totally something that I can do and nobody would be able to stop me.
00:50:27.528 - 00:50:30.326, Speaker D: That's the negative side. But the positive side of being able.
00:50:30.348 - 00:50:32.822, Speaker E: To actually change this metadata later on.
00:50:32.876 - 00:50:36.934, Speaker D: Is because, listen, this space is so new, it's developing every day.
00:50:37.052 - 00:50:41.058, Speaker E: We don't know what's going to be the best decentralized storage mechanism.
00:50:41.154 - 00:50:44.614, Speaker D: We don't know what new ones might come out, we don't know what servers.
00:50:44.662 - 00:50:46.042, Speaker E: Might crash and go down.
00:50:46.176 - 00:50:48.534, Speaker D: So let's say, for example, board ape.
00:50:48.582 - 00:50:50.694, Speaker E: Holders assets were on a centralized server.
00:50:50.742 - 00:50:51.114, Speaker D: They're not.
00:50:51.152 - 00:50:53.326, Speaker E: They're on IPFS. But just saying as an example, if.
00:50:53.348 - 00:51:00.318, Speaker D: They were and that server goes down, well, I would imagine that all holders would very much want the creators of.
00:51:00.324 - 00:51:02.686, Speaker E: The project to change that metadata to.
00:51:02.708 - 00:51:06.834, Speaker D: Be on something like IPFS. Or are we where the asset might be up again?
00:51:06.872 - 00:51:08.786, Speaker E: Or viewable so the person can see.
00:51:08.808 - 00:51:10.754, Speaker D: The NFT artwork in their wallet and enjoy it?
00:51:10.792 - 00:51:11.138, Speaker G: Right?
00:51:11.224 - 00:51:19.198, Speaker D: So the mutability of the metadata or the token Uri of the media file is definitely an area of security risk.
00:51:19.214 - 00:51:22.038, Speaker E: But also just an area to think about when you're looking at projects and.
00:51:22.124 - 00:51:23.174, Speaker D: Something to look into.
00:51:23.292 - 00:51:29.910, Speaker C: I'm also hearing you say that it's early days, these things will evolve, we'll figure some of it out. But I'm also hearing the underlying idea.
00:51:29.980 - 00:51:31.538, Speaker A: Here is it's also kind of an.
00:51:31.564 - 00:51:33.114, Speaker C: Opportunity because both of you guys have.
00:51:33.152 - 00:51:36.122, Speaker A: Alluded to this idea that NFTs are.
00:51:36.176 - 00:51:49.802, Speaker C: We'Re in the static phase. But as we see more and more dynamic NFTs and things change. It's almost like that can actually be a feature, not a buck. Because honestly, I thought of the example of Banksy when you were talking Michael and that famous self destructed Shredding painting.
00:51:49.866 - 00:51:52.494, Speaker A: That ended up actually being worth more later on.
00:51:52.532 - 00:51:53.886, Speaker C: And I'm not caring about this because.
00:51:53.908 - 00:51:55.534, Speaker A: Of the value, but because it was.
00:51:55.572 - 00:52:02.498, Speaker C: Actually a piece of performance art that this thing could be pointing to something different essentially from what the person had bought. And that was actually part of the.
00:52:02.504 - 00:52:03.586, Speaker A: Performance of that art.
00:52:03.688 - 00:52:05.266, Speaker E: I just want to applaud again because.
00:52:05.288 - 00:52:08.034, Speaker D: I agree, yeah, it's early days and.
00:52:08.152 - 00:52:11.798, Speaker E: This idea of dynamic NFTs or updating metadata, it's important.
00:52:11.884 - 00:52:13.762, Speaker D: And you never know when your NFT.
00:52:13.826 - 00:52:24.346, Speaker E: Might get a new superpower one day that might be important for something. Whatever it is, I think the ability to add some bit of flexibility is incredibly important, especially as literally every day something changes in the space.
00:52:24.448 - 00:52:31.082, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And it's also about harnessing what's native, about blockchains versus just simply imitating real.
00:52:31.136 - 00:52:33.126, Speaker A: Life in the blockchain.
00:52:33.238 - 00:52:34.542, Speaker C: So let's go to the next level.
00:52:34.596 - 00:52:37.854, Speaker A: On secondary sales, we've covered just a recap so far.
00:52:37.892 - 00:52:39.466, Speaker C: We covered the art, we've covered smart.
00:52:39.498 - 00:52:42.638, Speaker A: Contracts, we've covered drops, mints reveals more.
00:52:42.724 - 00:52:44.942, Speaker C: Post activities you just mentioned.
00:52:45.076 - 00:52:46.606, Speaker A: We talked about Bots, we talked about.
00:52:46.628 - 00:52:48.498, Speaker C: Token Gating briefly, we talked about the.
00:52:48.504 - 00:52:50.254, Speaker A: Primary sale as a category.
00:52:50.302 - 00:52:54.050, Speaker C: Now, do anything more to be said on the secondary and onward sales and security?
00:52:54.200 - 00:52:55.682, Speaker D: Yeah, I just want to bring back.
00:52:55.736 - 00:52:58.358, Speaker E: A topic that I started talking on before, at least when it comes to.
00:52:58.364 - 00:53:01.734, Speaker D: Secondary marketplace security, which is this idea.
00:53:01.772 - 00:53:16.614, Speaker E: Of NFT Sleep Minting, where you can see that a marketplace might display a lot of activity around a specific NFT and famous people minting it when reality they're not. And someone is just using clever smart contract tactics to bait you into thinking that this is a popular new Mint.
00:53:16.662 - 00:53:17.658, Speaker D: I did write a blog on that.
00:53:17.664 - 00:53:21.338, Speaker E: Already about NFT Sleep Minting, but that's definitely a major security issue when it.
00:53:21.344 - 00:53:22.914, Speaker D: Comes to secondary marketplaces.
00:53:23.062 - 00:53:24.778, Speaker A: Great. Anything to add, Nas?
00:53:24.874 - 00:53:27.502, Speaker G: I would touch on the whole phishing aspect of things.
00:53:27.556 - 00:53:27.918, Speaker A: Great.
00:53:28.004 - 00:53:35.226, Speaker C: Tell me what is different about phishing with phishing as we know it today and email and elsewhere and NFT phishing.
00:53:35.258 - 00:53:36.522, Speaker A: That'S what I really want to know.
00:53:36.676 - 00:53:42.354, Speaker F: So the interesting part is that oftentimes for the traditional phishing, the attackers are.
00:53:42.392 - 00:53:47.766, Speaker G: Actually going to request information from you instead of action, whereas in the web.
00:53:47.788 - 00:53:50.118, Speaker F: Three space it tends to be more.
00:53:50.204 - 00:53:52.770, Speaker G: The action part that is promoted.
00:53:52.850 - 00:53:54.886, Speaker C: Interesting, because at the end of the.
00:53:54.908 - 00:54:06.346, Speaker G: Day, the secret information about yourself in the web3 space tends to be your private key. Right? And so instead of asking you for your private key, which is obvious, people.
00:54:06.448 - 00:54:08.534, Speaker F: Just ask you to perform an action.
00:54:08.582 - 00:54:20.058, Speaker G: That seemingly is mal malicious, but actually is. And so the thing that is required here is actually a work together of many parties.
00:54:20.154 - 00:54:20.366, Speaker F: You.
00:54:20.388 - 00:54:31.346, Speaker G: Basically need the users to be educated and to be very careful about their actions, especially now that there is no kind of like safety net for them.
00:54:31.528 - 00:54:33.186, Speaker F: If you think about you interacting with.
00:54:33.208 - 00:54:39.878, Speaker G: Your banks or other systems that safekeep your assets, ACH debit transfers were actually.
00:54:39.964 - 00:54:46.082, Speaker F: Reversible up to three days after they were done. That's a huge time window. But if you think about the blockchain.
00:54:46.146 - 00:54:50.162, Speaker G: None of it right? And so I think it's very critical.
00:54:50.226 - 00:54:54.390, Speaker F: For users to take the steps to be very proactive about their own operational.
00:54:54.470 - 00:54:56.774, Speaker G: Security, which I did like a tweetstorm.
00:54:56.822 - 00:54:57.898, Speaker F: About all this stuff that needs to.
00:54:57.904 - 00:54:59.850, Speaker G: Be done, but I would summarize it.
00:54:59.920 - 00:55:08.494, Speaker F: As create Chrome profiles. I think it's very important to have a dedicated environment for your browsing and communications, et cetera. And another one that is dedicated to.
00:55:08.532 - 00:55:13.194, Speaker G: Performing actions on the blockchain. And the two should never cross path.
00:55:13.242 - 00:55:16.638, Speaker F: Your MetaMask should be on a completely different Chrome profile.
00:55:16.734 - 00:55:17.954, Speaker G: And the reason for this is that.
00:55:17.992 - 00:55:22.866, Speaker F: Actually the ID standpoint where Chrome actually has a very strong isolation from a.
00:55:22.888 - 00:55:32.838, Speaker G: Data and code execution perspective that is native to it. And so having very different environments, strongly isolated environments, is a very important one.
00:55:33.004 - 00:55:36.514, Speaker F: Another one is move things to cold.
00:55:36.562 - 00:55:43.962, Speaker G: Wallet as much as you can. Hardware wallets and so on are really important to have and keep as offline as possible.
00:55:44.096 - 00:55:45.894, Speaker F: And the third one that people don't.
00:55:45.942 - 00:56:07.310, Speaker G: Really think so much about is don't instead to use burner accounts. Actually, most of the wallets these days allow you to just with a single click, create a new account. And so all you have to do is just funding this account, perform whichever action you think is non malicious, but at least you kind of like isolate.
00:56:07.390 - 00:56:09.842, Speaker F: The blast radius to this specific new.
00:56:09.896 - 00:56:12.514, Speaker G: Account with just the money that you put in, right?
00:56:12.552 - 00:56:13.746, Speaker F: And it's not going to put in.
00:56:13.768 - 00:56:15.518, Speaker G: Jeopardy the rest of your asset.
00:56:15.614 - 00:56:17.366, Speaker F: Take up these burners almost as like.
00:56:17.388 - 00:56:20.422, Speaker G: The space chamber that is basically being.
00:56:20.476 - 00:56:22.498, Speaker F: Used to isolate spaceship.
00:56:22.594 - 00:56:35.718, Speaker G: And you have this chamber that potentially basically get everything sucked into the void, right? But at least it's segmented and isolated to this. Then there is the wallet part. Think of wallets as the browsers.
00:56:35.814 - 00:56:39.814, Speaker F: If you think about a browser as a way to access Internet and various.
00:56:39.862 - 00:56:43.450, Speaker G: Networks that are full of untrusted parties.
00:56:43.610 - 00:56:46.718, Speaker F: The wallets are the interface between you.
00:56:46.804 - 00:56:55.794, Speaker G: And the world of Web Three. And with Docs helping you adopt by default the best and most secure behaviors, right?
00:56:55.992 - 00:56:58.526, Speaker F: My phone or Chrome and other pieces.
00:56:58.558 - 00:57:00.866, Speaker G: Of software are really here to tell.
00:57:00.888 - 00:57:13.990, Speaker F: Me, okay, what are the permissions that I'm giving away? I'm allowing it to use my microphone, my webcam, am I yet to perform fetch information from my keychain, cryptographic, sensitive materials and so on, right?
00:57:14.060 - 00:57:16.454, Speaker A: Only access location while using the app.
00:57:16.572 - 00:57:18.642, Speaker F: Exactly. And so if you think about it.
00:57:18.716 - 00:57:20.394, Speaker G: The wallets are no different.
00:57:20.512 - 00:57:22.986, Speaker F: You actually hand over permissions on the.
00:57:23.008 - 00:57:25.670, Speaker G: Blockchain through set approval for all calls.
00:57:25.750 - 00:57:28.954, Speaker F: Giving allowances for protocols and contracts to.
00:57:28.992 - 00:57:39.646, Speaker G: Move funds on your behalf, fungible or non fungible assets. And so the wallet should be able to tell you, hey, here are all the permissions that you've given.
00:57:39.748 - 00:57:42.094, Speaker F: Hey, these permissions, you actually didn't set.
00:57:42.132 - 00:57:44.414, Speaker G: An expiration, you should probably add one.
00:57:44.532 - 00:57:51.090, Speaker F: And it should be able to do more than that. It should even be able to simulate the consequences of a transaction even before.
00:57:51.240 - 00:57:53.518, Speaker G: The network receives the transaction.
00:57:53.614 - 00:57:56.162, Speaker F: So that, you know, even before submitting.
00:57:56.226 - 00:58:02.678, Speaker G: Anything or even signing it, that it is a malicious piece of content. So wallets are going to really develop.
00:58:02.764 - 00:58:07.042, Speaker F: Into safety and even potentially privacy preserving.
00:58:07.106 - 00:58:09.110, Speaker G: Layers for you in the future.
00:58:09.260 - 00:58:10.370, Speaker A: That's fantastic.
00:58:10.450 - 00:58:15.306, Speaker C: Earlier you mentioned this trade off essentially about what it means to build something at scale. And a lot of what you just.
00:58:15.328 - 00:58:17.686, Speaker A: Described when it came to the wallet.
00:58:17.718 - 00:58:24.302, Speaker C: Security that makers and builders can do to help users, marketplaces can do, wallet makers can do.
00:58:24.436 - 00:58:26.986, Speaker A: Is there anything lost in the abstraction.
00:58:27.018 - 00:58:32.494, Speaker C: Layer that comes with more usability? Because there's a classic false framing, I guess, between usability and security here.
00:58:32.532 - 00:58:33.678, Speaker D: But do you have a point of.
00:58:33.684 - 00:58:36.178, Speaker C: View there about trading off that usability and security?
00:58:36.344 - 00:58:46.622, Speaker F: Yeah, that's a great question. A lot of it is going to require standardization of interfaces, standardization of actions. And so we're probably going to lose.
00:58:46.766 - 00:58:48.982, Speaker G: A little bit of creativity and just.
00:58:49.036 - 00:58:52.086, Speaker F: Wiggle room in term of what you can do as a creator or as.
00:58:52.108 - 00:58:54.706, Speaker G: Someone who designed the protocol for NFTs.
00:58:54.818 - 00:59:00.514, Speaker F: But ultimately the positive stuff that you get out of it really far outweights.
00:59:00.562 - 00:59:11.814, Speaker G: I would say in the negative. Because when you start standardizing more of these interactions, you basically allow deeper introspection from third parties.
00:59:11.942 - 00:59:15.086, Speaker F: If you have more standardization around the type of actions that are allowed by.
00:59:15.108 - 00:59:16.666, Speaker G: A smart contract, it's going to remove.
00:59:16.698 - 00:59:19.534, Speaker F: A lot of complexity for the wallet to basically be able to say like.
00:59:19.572 - 00:59:22.042, Speaker G: Okay, I'm going to scan this protocol.
00:59:22.106 - 00:59:23.486, Speaker F: Okay, this thing is known, this thing.
00:59:23.508 - 00:59:27.506, Speaker G: Is known, this thing is not known. Market as an alert, this thing is.
00:59:27.528 - 00:59:30.018, Speaker F: Known, this thing is known, this thing is known. It's going to be almost like a.
00:59:30.024 - 00:59:33.474, Speaker G: Reference game in term of what is.
00:59:33.512 - 00:59:35.846, Speaker F: Known and what is the sensitivity or.
00:59:35.868 - 00:59:45.890, Speaker G: The criticality of each one of these building blocks that are non part of standards. It will allow wallets to provide deeper.
00:59:46.050 - 00:59:51.190, Speaker F: Insight into the sensitivity of actions that are being performed by the users, therefore.
00:59:51.270 - 00:59:54.102, Speaker G: Helping them make better educated decisions.
00:59:54.246 - 00:59:56.154, Speaker F: And so it really feels no different.
00:59:56.192 - 01:00:06.798, Speaker G: From iOS really, because the operating system has a set of permissions and the set of actions that the applications are allowed to do and gated by specific.
01:00:06.884 - 01:00:09.690, Speaker F: Standard permissions that are called iOS entitlements.
01:00:09.850 - 01:00:13.226, Speaker G: And so having more standardization will remove.
01:00:13.258 - 01:00:17.406, Speaker F: A little bit more on the flexibility side, but bring a lot more from a security standpoint.
01:00:17.518 - 01:00:25.026, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. So I want to pick up on some really interesting trends and looking ahead that we've talked about, which is you.
01:00:25.048 - 01:00:28.206, Speaker C: Guys touched briefly on dynamic NFTs as being a really promising idea.
01:00:28.248 - 01:00:30.294, Speaker A: We touched on identity, we touched on.
01:00:30.332 - 01:00:35.574, Speaker C: Token gated experiences and the role of NFTs in this. Where else are some of the most.
01:00:35.612 - 01:00:44.170, Speaker A: Interesting things either near term or on the horizon that are promising or interesting areas of work, especially when security can unlock things there?
01:00:44.320 - 01:00:46.086, Speaker F: Yeah, so a few things that I'm.
01:00:46.118 - 01:00:50.778, Speaker G: Super excited about are adoption of NFTs.
01:00:50.874 - 01:00:55.034, Speaker F: By institutions, custody solutions and custody providers.
01:00:55.082 - 01:00:57.646, Speaker G: To start supporting more and more of.
01:00:57.668 - 01:01:01.982, Speaker F: These NFTs and use cases that come with these NFTs, especially as they start.
01:01:02.036 - 01:01:05.394, Speaker G: Allowing you to claim additional assets and.
01:01:05.432 - 01:01:12.066, Speaker F: Access to various experiences. I really believe that institutions should also be parties to that just like they.
01:01:12.088 - 01:01:26.662, Speaker G: Were for the regular crypto movement and then DeFi after that and so on. One other thing that I'm also super excited about is the aspect of NFTs that reap change with you because it.
01:01:26.716 - 01:01:30.326, Speaker F: Actually defines the social branches around you.
01:01:30.348 - 01:01:33.334, Speaker G: And social subgrad that you start joining.
01:01:33.462 - 01:01:38.106, Speaker F: And so I believe that having NFTs that can actually change with you as.
01:01:38.128 - 01:01:49.194, Speaker G: You evolve will be critical. Actually, if you think about social networks such as Facebook and Instagram and Snapchat and so on, you tend to associate.
01:01:49.322 - 01:01:53.086, Speaker F: The entire network to the subgrac that.
01:01:53.108 - 01:01:56.494, Speaker G: You actually have on these networks, whether.
01:01:56.532 - 01:02:02.610, Speaker F: That'S your family on Facebook, it can be work relationship on Twitter, crypto, Twitter, and it's going to be like NFT Twitter, right?
01:02:02.680 - 01:02:10.854, Speaker G: And so I think that it's very important as we kind of start defining these NFTs as the social bridges to.
01:02:10.892 - 01:02:12.614, Speaker F: Have them be able to evolve with.
01:02:12.652 - 01:02:15.046, Speaker G: You, whether that's visual, whether that's in.
01:02:15.068 - 01:02:16.886, Speaker F: The information that they actually hold, the.
01:02:16.908 - 01:02:29.654, Speaker G: Type of experiences that they provide. And I believe that we're going to go beyond just images and we're going to start going into NFTs that are themselves interactive.
01:02:29.782 - 01:02:31.514, Speaker F: Right, so you pick up like Web.
01:02:31.552 - 01:02:43.290, Speaker G: One, web Two, web Three, web One would be static PFPs, web Two start being dynamic PFPs which are starting to come up. And then the equivalent of the Web Three would be like a very deep.
01:02:43.370 - 01:02:46.270, Speaker F: Level of interactions with the NFT itself.
01:02:46.340 - 01:02:49.554, Speaker G: Whether it's like rich media content, whether.
01:02:49.592 - 01:02:50.446, Speaker F: That'S a different format.
01:02:50.478 - 01:03:01.522, Speaker G: It could be like applications, right, but just like starting having NFTs that are very unique for you as an individual, but still evolve with you over time.
01:03:01.576 - 01:03:02.850, Speaker F: Is going to be pretty critical.
01:03:02.930 - 01:03:09.698, Speaker C: It's like NFTs not just a social network as you said earlier, but actually NFTs as representation of identity, but even.
01:03:09.724 - 01:03:11.894, Speaker A: Beyond that, NFTs as evolution.
01:03:12.022 - 01:03:12.602, Speaker G: Exactly.
01:03:12.736 - 01:03:14.106, Speaker E: When I initially told you about the.
01:03:14.128 - 01:03:16.858, Speaker D: NFT stack, the actual final rung of.
01:03:16.944 - 01:03:20.214, Speaker E: Token gating is the area that is the most underexplored.
01:03:20.262 - 01:03:23.978, Speaker D: Everyone's focused right now on just minting and trading NFTs but how are you.
01:03:23.984 - 01:03:25.130, Speaker E: Going to use these things in the future?
01:03:25.200 - 01:03:26.446, Speaker D: And I think there are so many.
01:03:26.468 - 01:03:27.806, Speaker E: Components that are excited about them and.
01:03:27.828 - 01:03:30.190, Speaker D: I'll rapid fire all the ones that I believe in.
01:03:30.260 - 01:03:31.774, Speaker A: Great lightning round go.
01:03:31.892 - 01:03:38.386, Speaker E: So like for starters DeFi NFTs. I talk about gaming NFTs and how does that relate to DeFi? Well, you could see a situation where.
01:03:38.408 - 01:03:40.594, Speaker D: You might actually rent an NFT and.
01:03:40.632 - 01:03:43.662, Speaker E: Renting an NFT presents a lot of interesting problems with ownership.
01:03:43.726 - 01:03:45.538, Speaker D: Like how do you actually transfer an.
01:03:45.544 - 01:03:46.866, Speaker E: Asset to somebody else to use in.
01:03:46.888 - 01:03:48.518, Speaker D: A game without them running away with.
01:03:48.524 - 01:03:49.362, Speaker E: It on the blockchain.
01:03:49.426 - 01:03:49.654, Speaker D: Right?
01:03:49.692 - 01:03:53.526, Speaker E: And it's actually a very challenging thing to discover and how smart contracts or.
01:03:53.548 - 01:04:01.114, Speaker D: Smart contract wallets interact or staking pools for renting NFT. That's like one area. Another area is layer two NFTs and.
01:04:01.152 - 01:04:03.306, Speaker E: How NFTs might be moved across chain, right?
01:04:03.328 - 01:04:07.962, Speaker D: So for example, maybe you don't necessarily want to move your board ape to.
01:04:08.016 - 01:04:10.730, Speaker E: Another chain because its provenance is on Ethereum main net.
01:04:10.800 - 01:04:11.866, Speaker D: But if there was ever to be.
01:04:11.888 - 01:04:13.534, Speaker E: Some sort of game that you wanted.
01:04:13.572 - 01:04:16.206, Speaker D: To leverage your board Ape, well do.
01:04:16.228 - 01:04:17.946, Speaker E: You really need to transfer the asset.
01:04:17.978 - 01:04:20.346, Speaker D: Across chain or could you just represent.
01:04:20.378 - 01:04:22.618, Speaker E: Your ownership of the asset on another chain?
01:04:22.714 - 01:04:26.450, Speaker D: Of course that's great for simpler assets but for more complicated assets that are.
01:04:26.520 - 01:04:31.070, Speaker E: Composable with other elements in the ecosystem those are almost impossible to move across chain.
01:04:31.150 - 01:04:32.386, Speaker D: So that's another area.
01:04:32.488 - 01:04:33.042, Speaker A: Right?
01:04:33.176 - 01:04:37.138, Speaker C: What is the significance of cross chain NFTs? Why should someone even care to do that?
01:04:37.224 - 01:04:41.190, Speaker D: So you could basically be able to do a lot of transactions with your.
01:04:41.260 - 01:04:44.546, Speaker E: Token or your asset or your NFT on another chain that's a lot cheaper.
01:04:44.578 - 01:04:47.398, Speaker D: And a little bit more scalable. But again, like I said, there's a.
01:04:47.404 - 01:04:49.474, Speaker E: Lot of implications there for tracking provenance.
01:04:49.522 - 01:04:58.646, Speaker D: And how things would move around. And then to me I think the future of all of this stuff and this is what we talked about is an NFT is right now this composition.
01:04:58.678 - 01:05:02.182, Speaker E: Of metadata off chain and it's actually not very composable.
01:05:02.246 - 01:05:03.806, Speaker D: A smart contract can determine if you.
01:05:03.828 - 01:05:05.114, Speaker E: Own a board Ape but it cannot.
01:05:05.162 - 01:05:11.838, Speaker D: Determine if your board ape has gold fur, right? It's not very granular. And you can imagine a situation where.
01:05:11.924 - 01:05:14.946, Speaker E: You have this non transferable NFT in.
01:05:14.968 - 01:05:29.346, Speaker D: Your wallet that sort of represents your decentralized profile. And this profile could have things like preferences like Nas said earlier, dark mode and light mode. They could have things like your status, your relationship status. Obviously your profile picture could be one of them.
01:05:29.448 - 01:05:31.186, Speaker E: It could be a series of connected.
01:05:31.218 - 01:05:33.446, Speaker D: Wallets like Nas mentioned earlier for being.
01:05:33.468 - 01:05:35.190, Speaker E: Able to delegate minting to other things.
01:05:35.260 - 01:05:40.298, Speaker D: Right? And all of a sudden you could have this NFT that you can take from application to application.
01:05:40.464 - 01:05:42.666, Speaker E: Each application would ingest all of this.
01:05:42.688 - 01:05:52.302, Speaker D: Data about you and then basically allow you to customize the front end user experience. I mean, think about decentralized social media. Imagine that you had an NFT where.
01:05:52.356 - 01:05:55.498, Speaker E: You specified how the Twitter algorithm displayed.
01:05:55.514 - 01:06:03.678, Speaker D: To you tweets, and when you logged into Twitter and connected your wallet, twitter would then recognize your preference and then display the tweets to you in the.
01:06:03.684 - 01:06:05.358, Speaker E: Order in which you specified. Right?
01:06:05.444 - 01:06:09.266, Speaker D: That's a super powerful idea that doesn't exist in the current state because you.
01:06:09.288 - 01:06:10.578, Speaker E: Don'T actually own your own data.
01:06:10.664 - 01:06:11.906, Speaker D: Whereas if you had an NFT in.
01:06:11.928 - 01:06:13.486, Speaker E: Your wallet that had all your preferences.
01:06:13.598 - 01:06:17.186, Speaker D: You do own your own data. Right. And what's interesting about this type of.
01:06:17.208 - 01:06:18.562, Speaker E: NFT, and this is where I think.
01:06:18.616 - 01:06:41.642, Speaker D: A lot of NFTs are going to go, especially when we think about the world being run on this stuff, right. A very small component of it is going to know speculative JPEGs. It's going to be NFTs that can be used. And these are NFTs that are non transferable. They're very, very stateful, they're very composable and they're also not necessarily limited. Like in theory, everybody should have one of these, right? There's not only ten K of them.
01:06:41.696 - 01:06:42.154, Speaker A: Yes.
01:06:42.272 - 01:06:42.554, Speaker G: Right.
01:06:42.592 - 01:06:44.506, Speaker E: And the current example that exists today.
01:06:44.608 - 01:06:48.334, Speaker D: That is almost like the first iteration of all of this is enfs, right?
01:06:48.372 - 01:06:50.394, Speaker E: It is sort of like your decentralized profile.
01:06:50.442 - 01:06:53.518, Speaker D: So where I see a lot of this going is a lot of the.
01:06:53.524 - 01:06:55.406, Speaker E: Next phase of NFTs is going to.
01:06:55.428 - 01:07:02.046, Speaker D: Be this leveraging the identity composability and then this ultra stateful nature that an.
01:07:02.068 - 01:07:03.914, Speaker E: NFT can have at a smart contract.
01:07:03.962 - 01:07:06.226, Speaker D: Level in order move throughout the ecosystem.
01:07:06.258 - 01:07:07.602, Speaker E: And compose with other protocols.
01:07:07.666 - 01:07:10.578, Speaker D: So that's sort of where I see it going forward. That's my ramble.
01:07:10.674 - 01:07:12.086, Speaker A: It's not a ramble. I loved it.
01:07:12.108 - 01:07:12.918, Speaker C: And in fact I'm going to give.
01:07:12.924 - 01:07:14.386, Speaker A: You the last word, Michael.
01:07:14.498 - 01:07:15.366, Speaker D: No, yeah, I was going to say.
01:07:15.388 - 01:07:16.994, Speaker E: Thanks so much, Sono. This is an absolute blast.
01:07:17.042 - 01:07:18.646, Speaker D: I love this topic and time to.
01:07:18.668 - 01:07:20.114, Speaker E: Keep building this stuff and innovating.
01:07:20.162 - 01:07:21.382, Speaker D: And this is only the start.
01:07:21.436 - 01:07:24.854, Speaker E: It's really been a year since NFTs took off and it's really just scratching the surface.
01:07:24.902 - 01:07:27.238, Speaker C: So thank you for joining and we'll have many more conversations.
01:07:27.334 - 01:07:34.014, Speaker F: Thank you so much. There are just so many amazing things happening right now in NFTs. So many more things to build in the space.
01:07:34.132 - 01:07:37.278, Speaker C: This is the first of many conversations. Thank you so much for joining, you guys.
01:07:37.364 - 01:07:38.174, Speaker E: Thanks guys.
