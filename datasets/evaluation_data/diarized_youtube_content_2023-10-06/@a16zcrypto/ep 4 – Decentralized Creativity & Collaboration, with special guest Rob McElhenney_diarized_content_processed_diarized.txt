00:00:00.330 - 00:01:02.990, Speaker A: You welcome to Web Three with A Six and Z, a show about building the next generation of the Internet. This show is for anyone, whether artist, developer, company builder, community leader, or others seeking to understand and go deeper on all things crypto, Web Three, and the future of a decentralized, community governed and creator owned Internet. This episode was recorded live earlier this week at an event we at Asics and Z Crypto cohosted during Nftnyc in New York City with Adam and special guest and celebrated creator Rob Mcelani, Chris Dixon and myself. More background and context to follow, but in the conversation we covered the theme of decentralized media, decentralized content creation, collaboration, community, and more. And we also touch on topics such as the metaverse, storytelling, writers rooms, favorite TV shows, nostalgia, and much more. As a reminder, none of the following is investment, legal, business, tax advice. Please see A Six and Z.com
00:01:02.990 - 00:01:31.734, Speaker A: disclosures for more important information, including a link to a list of our investments. Okay, the rest of what follows is all from the live stage. Hi, everyone, thank you for coming. I'm Sonal Chalksy. I'm editor in chief at A Six and Z. Crypto, longtime editor in chief at Andreessen Horowitz and showrunner of the A Six and Z Podcast and now host of the new podcast Web Three with A Six and Z. And this is actually the first live taping of that show, so that's kind of exciting.
00:01:31.734 - 00:02:07.054, Speaker A: You're all part of that. And now let me just quickly introduce our guests on behalf of Asics and Z Crypto and Adam. I'm excited to welcome Chris Dixon, longtime technology investor, former startup, founder, founding and managing general partner of Asics and Z Crypto. And Rob McElhenny, longtime writer, actor and executive producer, known for the critically acclaimed comedy series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's hit its 15th season recently, in December, and broke records as the longest running live action TV sitcom. That's insane.
00:02:07.102 - 00:02:07.998, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty wild.
00:02:08.094 - 00:03:04.802, Speaker A: And he's also the creator, among many other things. I'm just highlighting a few things of Mythic Quest, which premiered a couple years ago on Apple TV and is set in the development studio, one of the most popular video games in the world. And I mentioned that because we'll touch on gaming in our talk. And finally, and probably most importantly for today, rob is the co founder and chairman of Adam, which is a community of storytellers and fans working together to create and own a new generation of characters and stories where the IP can be collectively owned by the communities who develop them. And the reason I gave you all this context is because it's one of my pet peeves when you tell people to introduce themselves because it's like, Wait, let's get to the real stuff. So we're just going to jump right in and start with before we go into the specifics of what you do, how you got here, let's start with the big picture, which is decentralized media. Like what does that even mean, decentralized content creation? And I don't know if you want to take that one first Chris and then Rob.
00:03:04.866 - 00:03:51.458, Speaker C: Sure. I mean, I think one of the promises of the Internet was if you think about things like Wikipedia as an example, or even going back earlier before Wikipedia, to kind of the ability for anyone to come along and create a website. One of the great promises of the Internet was to democratize things that were previously controlled by a small group of people. There's a very famous essay about open source software called The Cathedral and the Bazaar that kind of, I think is a nice characterization of this. And the idea is you sort of have two models for how to build software, how to build systems, how to build information systems, or content creation or whatever it might be. One model is you have kind of a priesthood, a kind of an elite group who kind of controls things. And the other model is you have just an open system where anyone can come along and through hard work and merit and creativity and whatever else it might be, come along and make their contribution.
00:03:51.458 - 00:04:54.742, Speaker C: Yeah, I think of Wikipedia as like a canonical example of this. When Wikipedia first came out in 2001, there were a bunch of encyclopedias, digital encyclopedias, including, for example, Encarda, which was made by Microsoft, where if you went to Encarta and you looked up, let's say a giraffe, you'd see a beautiful photograph of a giraffe and maybe some text written by a draft scholar. And it was like really nice and well put together. Wikipedia came along and it was this open system, and literally anyone can come even without your real name and contribute. And at first Wikipedia was sort of chaos, but over time it got much, much better and people came together and they kind of self organized people interested in chemistry went off and edited the chemistry stuff. And it turned out, as we know today, to be this incredible repository of human knowledge that's edited in this open, decentralized way and really kind of replaced when Carter, I think, went out of business in 2009 or something. So this was always kind of the promise of the internet going back to the early ninety s or even the idea that you could democratize first information in the first era and then the next era you could democratize publishing, which we've seen with things like twitter and Facebook.
00:04:54.742 - 00:05:08.414, Speaker C: And obviously that's played out really interesting ways in social media. But now we have the possibility to kind of go further and decentralize ownership and creativity and all other kinds of aspects of the human experience. And that's what Adam's focusing on, I would say.
00:05:08.452 - 00:05:22.258, Speaker B: I really like the idea of owning what I make, that's for sure. But just in terms of the idea of decentralized content creation, that's a phrase I've heard a number of times, and I've read it a few times, and I don't know what it means.
00:05:22.344 - 00:05:23.522, Speaker A: Yeah. What does it mean?
00:05:23.576 - 00:05:26.260, Speaker B: I don't know. How do you do that?
00:05:26.790 - 00:05:28.114, Speaker A: Well, I want you to answer that.
00:05:28.152 - 00:06:15.294, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think that anybody who's ever built something, created something. Let's talk about a TV show specifically, because that's what I do. They recognize it's a collaboration, but there is a certain amount of curation that goes into it. And I think any rational person can recognize that there is a curative level that's a part of the creation of anything. However, who has been the curator traditionally is a question that needs to be asked and is being asked culturally right now, and has been for at least the last 1015 years. And it's an important question because as we look around, we realize, well, okay, so just because we need to curate these materials, how do we open up the space to allow for other curators to come into the process? And I think that the ability to scale like that is so exciting.
00:06:15.422 - 00:06:57.914, Speaker A: So I want to pick up on something you both mentioned. Chris mentioned the cathedral and the bazaar, which is actually an idea, as he said, that's been around for ages. But when I think of a bazaar, I think of a very messy, crowded, kind of chaotic place where, frankly, you have thieves, you have people running around, you have a lot of noise. You can't get anything done necessarily. And it's insane to me that you are talking about I get the curation part, but bringing a more collaborative creativity and decentralizing that because I think of curation and creation as a very not only cathedral like enterprise, but there's a showrunner and someone who has a vision. I mean, I'm preaching to you. You are a very renowned creator.
00:06:57.914 - 00:07:02.322, Speaker A: How do you think of that playing out and as you've been building and thinking about adam yeah, so I think.
00:07:02.376 - 00:07:35.438, Speaker B: It helps to start with how a writer's room generally works, because a lot of people don't work in writers rooms. They don't necessarily know, and they think there's a level of mystique about it. But truthfully, it's not that complicated. You get a group of people together, generally curated by their scripts or word of mouth, and it could be anywhere from three to 25 people in a room, all working towards a common goal. And everybody has a certain set of talents and abilities. Some people are really great natural storytellers. Some people are really great.
00:07:35.438 - 00:08:07.362, Speaker B: In my case with my shows, they could tell jokes, they're really funny. Some people are just really weird and bring in a completely fresh and different perspective. But you can't have 25 people talking at once in the same way you can't have three people talking at once. You'll set up a situation where a showrunner, for example, would suggest, okay, today I'd like to talk about this, and then that person would be the arbiter of where things headed. Because if you just had, again, 25 people, all with different ideas of where something could go, you'd never be able to get anywhere.
00:08:07.426 - 00:08:08.134, Speaker A: Exactly right.
00:08:08.172 - 00:08:33.642, Speaker B: So you wind up with a person who's ostensibly up at the whiteboard with a marker saying, okay, that's a great idea. That's a great idea, that's a great idea, that's a great idea. Now that is a very centralized model. And there's a reason for that. It's because otherwise it would be chaos. So we create this situation where the showrunner is using the talents of everybody in the room. And when they come into the room, it's agreed that that's the vision.
00:08:33.642 - 00:09:10.778, Speaker B: That's the person who we're working with and for, and we're following his her or their vision for what the show might be. And so traditionally, as I've mentioned before, right now there's still hundreds of opportunities and shows, but it's very difficult to get into that position. And the way that I think of decentralized content creation and the approach that we're going to take is essentially just scaling that system up. So the way that it would work is the very first round, we're going to have four rooms, four writers rooms. Four writers rooms. Well, let's even back up. Let's start with the application process.
00:09:10.778 - 00:10:14.202, Speaker B: So it was really important to us from the very beginning that we didn't want to have a pay to play model. We wanted it to be merit based. So we just simply asked the community, actually we asked the world, who is your favorite character of all time and why? And you had 500 words or less to explain who your favorite character was of all time and why? And the answers we got back were stunning. Stunning, because you realize, wow, people identify with different characters for different reasons, and they have a very specific point of view, and they're going to bring who they are to that answer, and you're going to see who they are through that very, very simple answer. The idea is we would then curate those and then select 100 people. This is for the first round, we would break those rooms up into groups of 25. And in the beginning, we'll have a room lead and a room lead in each room, a person that I've found over the years through Mythic Quest or through Sunny, or through my years of running rooms, I've identified a few key writers that could run those rooms.
00:10:14.266 - 00:10:16.078, Speaker A: So the people that you've designated, the.
00:10:16.084 - 00:10:53.166, Speaker B: People in the room, these are people that work for Adam. And then there's a second lead. And the second lead would be somebody who is an assistant or somebody who's been around a PA or a writer's assistant or somebody who's learning and is on their way up. Now, traditionally, they would both be working their way up and then going to either be in other people's writers rooms or create their own shows, very small and a very elite amount of group of people. So to scale that up, what if we created a room full of 25 people? The room lead and the second lead would work together with those groups of 25, and they would create something together.
00:10:53.268 - 00:10:53.582, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:53.636 - 00:11:24.134, Speaker B: Each group will create a character. So right from day one, things got really weird in the best of ways, because I sat there with the entire team and we talked about, well, how would this actually work? And I said, they all know how I run a room because they've all worked with me in the past. So I just assumed this seems to be the easiest way to start, and then we'll see how things diverge from there. But right from the very beginning, one of the room leads said, I wouldn't run my room the way that you would.
00:11:24.252 - 00:11:26.902, Speaker A: Interesting. So they pushed back on that to do it their own way.
00:11:26.956 - 00:11:27.830, Speaker B: That's the whole point.
00:11:27.900 - 00:11:28.182, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:28.236 - 00:11:53.422, Speaker B: And we asked him, how would you run the room? He would do it this way. And then we asked Keanu Taylor, who is our chief creative officer, how would you run a room? Completely different, somebody else completely different. Then we asked the second leads, well, when you're going to be running the rooms, how would you do it? I think I would look at it from this perspective, and already you're realizing what's happening is that it's not that I'm passing the baton off. They're ripping the baton away from me and creating their new system.
00:11:53.476 - 00:11:56.206, Speaker A: They're in fact, whacking you in the head with the exactly.
00:11:56.308 - 00:12:22.314, Speaker B: So the idea is, when we get to scale that those groups of 25 people, what will start to happen? This is something I noticed over the years, too, which I've always found fascinating. It's about an average of 10% of any given writers room goes on to create their own show. It's about that. So if there's a room of ten, there's usually one person that goes off to create their own room, a room of 20. There's two people. I don't know why that is. It just seems to be the case.
00:12:22.314 - 00:12:39.018, Speaker B: And so our thought is that when you start to open and expand those ideas, that there's going to be 10% of those groups that are going to just naturally rise up and say, I'd like to now spin out my own room and do my own version of it. And that's where we start to get decentralized.
00:12:39.114 - 00:12:56.766, Speaker A: I feel like we should coin a phrase right here on stage, like McElheny's Rule. The rule. Because if you extend your idea even further, you could almost argue that in the entire population of potential creators, that one out of every ten is someone who can actually go and create their own creative enterprise.
00:12:56.878 - 00:14:06.858, Speaker B: However, I would say this, and I think this is a really important distinction. I think this is also what separates Adam from, say, just a traditional writer's room or traditional approach? Is that simply because of scale? Regardless of how much money Hollywood has, regardless of how big these budgets are, there are certain things that are valued. And you have to, for example, curate the writers room because you only have a limited amount of budgets. Some shows are really big, some shows are really small, but at the end of the day, you still have to make decisions. So generally, what's valued in a writer's room is the ability to execute drafts or the ability to break stories. And those are the two most important things in a writer's room. Okay, but does that mean if you're really good at identifying the specifics of somebody who's experienced a tremendous amount of trauma and you can bring that into a character and imbue that character with those very specific characteristics, why do you have any less or more value than anybody else that's in that room? Well, only if you're working with a very constrained budget or idea.
00:14:06.858 - 00:14:19.578, Speaker B: If you start to expand from there and say, well, maybe the criteria through which we're looking for writers or it's really creators starts to expand, and I think we're already seeing that with the applications, it's really fascinating.
00:14:19.674 - 00:14:40.598, Speaker A: So I have to say, though, and I hear that what you're saying is that's phase One. But a question here. What about that is uniquely web three. Because quite frankly, a lot of that could be done in Web Two. Like you could use crowdfunding. There's fan fiction. I mean, Chris, you were formerly an investor in Kickstarter, and one of my all time favorite shows, Veronica Mars, was like Crowdfunded to be Made.
00:14:40.598 - 00:14:52.198, Speaker A: Now, granted, that was by the original showrunner, Another Rob, but I'm still not quite hearing what's unique here about Web Three. So I'd love you guys to share more of that because I'm sure our audience wants to know too.
00:14:52.284 - 00:15:30.866, Speaker C: Well, I think in the beginning it is more just as sort of a way to kind of keep things less chaotic and sort of controlled and kind of ease into the full vision in the beginning. It is something that probably could and is run on a kind of conventional website model. The thought is that over time, you want to use blockchains for a couple of reasons. One is blockchains have this feature that I like to call can't be Evil instead of don't be evil. So Google famously had this saying, this was sort of their motto early on, which meant, like, don't have too many ads on the page. Don't take too much money from the ecosystem. But then over time, the founders retired and management took over and all of these kinds of promises they'd made have not been kept.
00:15:30.866 - 00:16:25.858, Speaker C: And that's just kind of the story we've been now have 30 years of commercial Internet, and that's basically been the case for almost everything that's existed, is that over time, the kind of charter of the corporation and the management team, and things end up overwhelming the initial promises of the website. One of the nice things with blockchains is you can commit architecturally in the blockchain itself, in the software itself, to a certain system, and including the economics of the system, the rules of the system. The rules. If you're, for example, a third party creator and you want to invest in this system and you want to build a livelihood on it, you know what the rules are going to be. You know what they're going to be forever. If you're a software developer and you want to build around this ecosystem, you want to build a new interface or a new game or some other new kind of experience, you know what the rules are, right? And so that's one very important feature is down the road, as you build this kind of bigger system, you want to make these various guarantees in order to grow the ecosystem. Blockchains also allow for some really interesting features, one of which we call Composability.
00:16:25.858 - 00:17:07.986, Speaker C: So Composability is a software concept that I think really explains is a concept that essentially you can treat software and services and various things on blockchains as kind of Lego bricks. So, for example, if Adam creates a set of characters, people can go fork those characters, they could make an alternative version of those characters that exist in a different universe. They could make a derivative version of the character, they can add to the character, and they can kind of treat it like little pieces, which is a very powerful concept. You mentioned before that these bizars can be chaotic. It's a very important organizing principle that we see in things like open source software for allowing millions of people to collaborate in a kind of coherent way. Right. And so there's a bunch of features like that, which I think you're the entrepreneur, not me.
00:17:07.986 - 00:17:19.622, Speaker C: But I believe down the road those features will become more salient in the beginning. It will be kind of a more controlled Web Two kind of experience to kind of figure out the group dynamics and all the other things.
00:17:19.756 - 00:18:14.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for me to accurately answer that question, I would have to start with why I became interested in Web Three in the first place. And it wasn't until I started listening to a lot of podcasts, but specifically Chris talking about his approach to why he felt it was important. And it's because it's taking the speculation out of it that I understood. And it's approaching Web Three as a means by which people are going to build the next version of the Internet. For some reason, whatever Chris was saying unlocks something in my brain and the way that I look at things and the way that I look at the future and the way I think we're headed based on leaders of the field and metaverse technologies and things like that. But in the short term. I love the idea of, again, using Web Three in our business to open up opportunity and access and to build a community that I understand.
00:18:14.700 - 00:19:37.458, Speaker B: And very specifically, in fact, it was Tim Rothbarden, I had research on this very podcast who said, it very succinctly that to think about a blockchain as a supercomputer in the sky that has no owner yet can enforce property rights in a way for digital assets that has never been able to be done before. But the idea that it can track IP and the transfer of IP and the enforcement of usage is really fascinating when you think about it to scale, because you have massive departments in we'll call it Web Two, but like in the in the studios right now, whose sole job is to just track the usage of their IP. Most of the time, it's to stop people from using it. Well. What if you looked at it differently and tried to figure out ways in which we could use that technology to track bits of IP essentially NFTs moving forward in the future, but moving towards a completely different way of interacting with stories. I mean, we can still work this company probably 90% this company could work using an old traditional Web Two model, but it's that last 10% that's the most important when you get to scale. Because to track that many transactions, which is what we're talking about, it'll have to be computational power.
00:19:37.544 - 00:20:09.658, Speaker C: So you mentioned, Rob, that the media world's used to stopping stuff, they're used to blocking stuff. I would argue this is not in their interests, that this is a pre Internet way of viewing the world. That the Internet is by its nature, wants to copy things. It's basically a giant copy machine is the Internet. The video game industry has figured this out and they've embraced copying. And so if you go on something like Steam, there's mods, there's forks streaming as an example. Some of the more forward thinking games company embraced it at first, but some of the older games companies, like Nintendo, they fought it, they saw it as copyright infringement.
00:20:09.658 - 00:20:54.154, Speaker C: Eventually they realized the marketing benefits outweigh the infringement costs. And I think a similar thing using Web Three, I think, will spread to movies, film writing, and they'll realize that it's better to have this giant engaged audience and then maybe figure out how to monetize some small portion of them the way that Fortnite and League of Legends does, right? So Fortnite, this is the modern way to make games. They're free and only a tiny percentage will buy things, but that's enough because people love it and they spread it and they pay your marketing costs. And I think this, like with Adam, I think one of the fascinating things, right, is you're not just going to have this community of creators, you're going to have this community of marketers. Yes, they're going to go out and they're going to evangelize it and they're going to own it. And that's a very powerful thing. I think that's one of the things explains the popularity of something like Dogecoin, which is a ridiculous cryptocurrency.
00:20:54.154 - 00:21:26.566, Speaker C: It's created as a joke. It is kind of a joke, yet it's popular because people have felt on the sidelines, they felt disenfranchised, and now they feel a sense of ownership. What if, instead of some silly coin like that, they actually own the next Marvel? Like, how passionate will they be? They will overwhelm any movie marketing budget. You could spend $300 million marketing a movie. If you have a passionate community of 50,000 people, markets itself, tweeting and writing about it, it will be the most powerful. So I think these all combined, you have this creative thing, you have financing, you have creation, but then probably most importantly, you have the evangelist, right?
00:21:26.668 - 00:22:03.154, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that's a huge tenet of what we're doing, which is community building. That's a huge aspect of what we're talking about. I mean, just today I went for a walk around the city and you see a line around the corner, and it was for sneakers, and you realize there's a massive sneaker community, and everybody's hanging out and talking, and they're really excited about the release of the new sneaker. And at the end of the day, it's just a variation of a bunch of cotton and plastic that's put on. And yes, there is a status element to it, but I think what people really identify with is the community of people that they can talk to about it. It's a collectible, but it's also something that you can engage with other human beings about.
00:22:03.154 - 00:22:58.434, Speaker B: And you see that, of course, in the entertainment industry with Marvel or with Star Wars or with Pixar, where people fall in love with the characters and the movies and the ethos of those companies. Well, what we haven't seen yet is a company that's built from the ground up, which is that if it's built by the people who are a part of the community, well, they're already in love with the characters themselves, and they can't wait to share those with the world. And again, if we continue to scale up from there, then I'm no longer very quickly in the position of being the arbiter to suggest that's a good character or not a good character, the community will create. And they can eventually spin off into rooms of where you could be a curator of one. And that's where the true decentralization comes in. Once we've got the ball rolling, you have rooms that are spinning out, where people are contributing these characters that they've created into this Atom universe.
00:22:58.562 - 00:23:00.194, Speaker A: Which the atom verse.
00:23:00.242 - 00:23:04.326, Speaker B: That's right. Which is owned specifically by the community itself.
00:23:04.428 - 00:23:22.990, Speaker A: So I'm bought in on this, and I agree that there is a distinction between what you can do with Web Two, for instance, with Fanfic you can't own, you don't get any upside. You don't have the discretion to decide the direction of your character. If you want to kill off Jar Jar beings who's like annoying, you can't decide that. There's still someone deciding that.
00:23:23.060 - 00:23:23.438, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:23.524 - 00:23:43.774, Speaker A: I want to talk now, though, a little deeper about the mechanics of how all this works. So specifically, one is what becomes canon? Is there a canon? I'd love for you to answer that, Rob. And then along those lines, I also want to know specifically, we're at NFT NYC this week. Where do NFTs come into all this? Maybe we can start with the canon.
00:23:43.822 - 00:24:19.422, Speaker B: Yes, and these are great questions. These are the questions that we're constantly asking ourselves. And I kept coming back to the same issue, which is, I should not be decided that it should be a collective, but how big is that collective? So we started just with the room of leads and second leads, and I said, okay, just for the sake of conversation, I'll start. I believe that we should start here. And then very quickly, I started hearing people saying, well, that's not such a great idea, old man. I think the way we should do is actually start here, because something that I learned a very long time ago is if you hire young people, listen.
00:24:19.476 - 00:24:22.238, Speaker A: To them young mentors is what I call it. Yes.
00:24:22.324 - 00:24:51.398, Speaker B: And you have these 23, 24 year old people who look at the world from a completely different perspective. And it's now shaping the way that we're setting up what those parameters are, even to start with. But we will have to start somewhere. And what we came up with is that we'll come up with 13 rules. And it was an arbitrary number. It seemed like unlucky in the best of ways. 13 rules of the universe that are immutable, at least to start, and then we'll build from there.
00:24:51.484 - 00:24:56.022, Speaker A: And by the way, when you say immutable, do you mean encoded into the smart contract or just kind of guidelines?
00:24:56.086 - 00:25:41.318, Speaker B: Just into the lore? And one of those, for example, would be, if you think about it, like the Marvel Universe, the only real rule that you see is that they're all existing in the same place and time insofar as they can interact with one another. But it's essentially our world plus superheroes and time travel and all sorts of different things. So we're figuring out what those immutable rules would be to begin. But then hopefully what happens is, just like any amendable document, let's just say that made sense at one point, to govern large groups of people in 25 years time. If that no longer or if there are aspects of that document that are no longer valid or valuable, they'll vote to change it.
00:25:41.404 - 00:26:18.094, Speaker C: One thing I could add is also that I think Rob's at the sort of most advanced end of the spectrum, but I think generally, I would argue the media. World. I think there's going to be a really interesting partnership between Web Three for a couple of reasons. One, I think that the media world is not particularly happy with the current configuration of the Internet, specifically all the intermediaries that stand in between them and their audiences. And so there's sort of an economic motivation, I think. Secondly, the media world, when I speak to people that work at Google, NFTs and all these other things seem very abstract to them. Media folks are used to selling kind of virtual experiences, goods.
00:26:18.094 - 00:26:19.170, Speaker C: It's not strange to them.
00:26:19.240 - 00:26:34.474, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. So where do the NFTs come in then, beyond the canon? Where does that play? Because we are talking about web three. So let's get into the mechanics of NFTs. Let's talk about Dows, like decentralized autonomous organizations and how that plays here. Like, how does a governance well, certainly.
00:26:34.512 - 00:27:23.430, Speaker B: From a governance perspective, I mean, that's how we're tracking everything. So when people are admitted into the initial room, let's just use that as an example, they're given an NFT, which is their ticket. It's their pass, it's non transferable. However, as we move forward and the community continues to grow, we'll be issuing other NFTs, and that will be our way to create governance, to track IP, to make sure people are, again, all built to the smart contract that people are being compensated, because all of us will own those characters together. We will eventually become decentralized at a certain point because the community will be able to dictate where those characters may be used. I see a lot of people roll their eyes when I'm having a conversation with them, and I say, well, the community will decide what happens. Well, how can a community of 10,000 people make a movie?
00:27:23.510 - 00:27:23.946, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:27:24.048 - 00:27:43.214, Speaker B: Really work that way, right. But what they can decide is we really love this studio and this filmmaker and this writer, and we trust her to take our canon. And of course, you build out what it is that can be changed or what can't be changed, and to take this grouping of characters and write her version of what that might be.
00:27:43.252 - 00:27:44.942, Speaker A: And that includes licensing that IP.
00:27:45.006 - 00:27:55.346, Speaker B: Exactly. So you see that actually happen in Marvel, where they will have different tones, different filmmakers come in. Essentially, you're building different levels of curation it.
00:27:55.368 - 00:28:35.890, Speaker A: Also, by the way, just speaking for myself personally, there's an aspect of what characters get to be made and not just who gets to decide and who gets to make it, but what gets made, which is actually one of the taglines in our trailer for web three, with a six and z as a premise of web three. But it's very salient to me that you use the Marvel example, Rob, because I was just thinking about how the spin off Ms. Marvel character is a Pakistani American woman. And I'm sorry, that would never have been greenlit, like 50 years ago. But you can only imagine what's possible if more things and more communities and more stories are being made by people who don't traditionally have a spot to decide that. So we don't even know what stories are possible.
00:28:35.960 - 00:29:15.678, Speaker B: Actually, 100%, even the criteria by which someone is judged as a creator, as a filmmaker, as a writer is changing. Yes, because you can get very granular and you can still have value. That is really exciting to me. That truly opens up access and opportunity, because you're not saying, sure, okay, send me your script. I've just opened up that opportunity. But what if you say, I'm not a writer, and then people say, well, then you shouldn't be in the writing business? Why? Just because you can't execute a fully realized script doesn't mean that you don't have a point of view, doesn't mean you don't have a story, doesn't mean that you don't have something to say. And that makes you valuable, and that's what makes you a part of this community.
00:29:15.678 - 00:30:00.678, Speaker B: That's why people fall in love with the characters that they're working on, and there will be an emotional investment. For example, when we say, okay, this is a character we created in the original Round, and it's this beautiful monster, and she's horrifically misunderstood, but she's considered a villain, but it turns out she's a hero. And we follow her arc, and we have both of this backstory written and this canon written, and then maybe it's even been licensed and made into a movie, and everybody falls in love, and then somebody suggests, should we kill her? And then the community has to come in, and there'd be massive amounts of debate. And I think that level of emotional attachment now, you don't just get to experience it in the second person. You're now a part of the it's.
00:30:00.694 - 00:30:08.462, Speaker A: Not just passive, it's interactive. I also have to say, excuse my language, but fuck only the emotional attachment because I want the financial stake to break.
00:30:08.516 - 00:30:10.510, Speaker B: Yeah, that's pretty good. That's why we're all here, isn't it?
00:30:10.580 - 00:30:23.166, Speaker A: No, but I mean, like, literally in those mean I'm not just saying this because I feel it like I feel like I own Gilmore Girls because I can quote every line. But if I'm contributing to that canon and I am creating things, I want financial stakes.
00:30:23.198 - 00:30:40.626, Speaker C: Well, that's why the NFT is important, because the NFT so an NFT, very simply, people think they're like JPEGs and art and things. NFT is a unit of digital ownership. It's the first time we've had this concept of true digital ownership on the Internet. If you go to C. Dixon, I don't really own that handle. You don't own it economically. You don't own it control wise.
00:30:40.626 - 00:30:59.902, Speaker C: An NFT, you truly own it's the first time. You can really domain names, maybe, but that was sort of a niche thing. But NFT is a very generalized concept. It can represent anything that the creator wants to imbue into that NFT. It's a unit of digital ownership. So it's giving those creators true ownership. And they can take that and they can do things, they can stake their claim to make money.
00:30:59.902 - 00:31:20.306, Speaker C: If it appreciates, they can potentially descending on how the system works. They can have governance rights, decide what's canon, maybe creative decisions, maybe other kinds of business decisions. They can take their NFT and take their ball and go home. They can go somewhere else. They can fork off. They can leave. The ability to have exit is a very important thing to kind of give power back to individuals.
00:31:20.306 - 00:31:35.446, Speaker C: Right. They can leave the system in the same way you can quit a job. If you couldn't quit a job, the employer would have all the power. An NFT lets you quit a system. It lets you quit an application. It lets other applications pop up that accept that NFT that compete with the original application. Adam will be one of many that have to compete and earn.
00:31:35.446 - 00:31:47.242, Speaker C: The users earn their loyalty instead of demanding it the way that Twitter does. I'm stuck on Twitter. I'm stuck on Twitter. So it's about shifting power to the individual by giving them true digital ownership.
00:31:47.386 - 00:31:59.934, Speaker A: So some of the properties are, I've heard ownership, non fungibility, the know, you can kind of partially, fractionally do things as well. What about you alluded to this a data portability? What about interoperability and going across mediums?
00:31:59.982 - 00:32:00.530, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:32:00.680 - 00:32:03.442, Speaker A: Stories don't live in one medium, as you well know.
00:32:03.576 - 00:32:04.260, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:04.630 - 00:32:08.974, Speaker A: You have a show that's also, like, about gaming. I mean, living in a gaming world. Like ubisoft.
00:32:09.022 - 00:32:38.286, Speaker B: Yeah. Look, if I'm being dead honest, I've been working in TV now for almost 20 years, and I've made a few TV shows I'm really proud of. And I'm less interested in working in traditional storytelling just because I've had the privilege and pleasure of doing it for so long. I want to look to see what's next. So the idea of just going to make a movie or making another TV show is not that interesting to me. So I'm really looking to see how are people going to be interacting with Story moving forward. And nobody can say for sure.
00:32:38.286 - 00:32:47.522, Speaker B: But I could tell you once again, if you look at what young people are doing, and I mean even younger than the 25 year olds, I mean, my children, how old are they? Eleven and ten.
00:32:47.656 - 00:32:48.558, Speaker A: Great ages.
00:32:48.654 - 00:33:32.170, Speaker B: And the way that they interact with Story and with gaming and with social with their friends is all just intertwining. And this has been predicted for many years. However, it's just starting to happen that the metaverse itself is starting to unfold. Now, whether or not it actually does and what the time frame is, who's to say? There's a lot of conjecture out there. However, we do know that we're headed to a space where people are going to interact with narrative in a completely different way. And I think that's what I'm most excited about for Adam is not the next two years. It's the next five to six years when we get into some really weird shit.
00:33:32.250 - 00:33:47.090, Speaker A: Okay, I want to riff on this for a bit. So let's talk about the really weird shit for a while. So, I mean, we're about the future. We're talking about the future. Let's start with the metaverse. We can't predict the future. It's always in the hands of creators to sort of figure it out as we go along, and users too.
00:33:47.090 - 00:33:50.806, Speaker A: But what are some of the things that excite you and that you think are possible here?
00:33:50.908 - 00:34:45.058, Speaker B: Well, I just finished this book, hasn't come out yet, but he's by Matthew Ball, and he wrote a book about the Metaverse, very creatively titled The Metaverse. He's not taking a position either way. He's just going to the people leading the field in the technology and asking questions. He also goes on to say that there's not really a complete definition of what it is, but he supposes, and I think this is fair, that a version of the Metaverse would be a massively scaled up series of networks that render real time 3d worlds that can be experienced, synchronously and persistently by an infinite amount of users. That's incredible because really what you're talking about is Ready Player One. And I know that stories like Snow.
00:34:45.074 - 00:35:03.190, Speaker C: Crash yeah, well, yeah, I mean, Metaverse is one of these kind of overloaded terms. People mean different things. The original snow crash was very VR. Ready. Player one is very VR. I think Matthew Ball might define it more as I believe, sort of getting more the Internet becomes more immersive, more important part of our lives, potentially 3D.
00:35:03.360 - 00:35:16.240, Speaker B: Well, he specifically says that it doesn't need to be AR or VR related, but I don't quite follow that. And if he was here, I'd ask him. Call bullshit, Matt. I don't understand how it can be a more immersive experience.
00:35:16.770 - 00:35:49.562, Speaker C: I think the argument would be if you're deeply into a discord right now, you can have sort of this flow state and you can have immersion in other ways, I think is a counterargument. But most likely we know the trajectory like The Oculus is already pretty good. Apple's got their VR headset. We know how this movie is going to go. The hardware is going to get tiny and light and deeply immersive and probably extremely popular. And the games will get better and the experiences will get better. And it'll just be look, I mean, all the trends people, I think on average it's 5 billion people use the Internet 5 hours a day now, which has gone up dramatically in terms of hours.
00:35:49.562 - 00:36:03.018, Speaker C: We might be capping out in terms of people, but certainly the level of immersion, the number of hours, the kind of importance in your life, both right now, we think of VR as playing, only it'll probably be work as well. There'll be all sorts of opportunities.
00:36:03.114 - 00:36:03.614, Speaker A: Education.
00:36:03.732 - 00:36:12.002, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, all sorts of things will probably move virtual and there will be sort of some kind of blurring of the lines probably between work and play, right, in that world.
00:36:12.136 - 00:36:17.858, Speaker B: But how do you get in that version of it where AR or VR isn't necessary? Because I think it's really important.
00:36:18.024 - 00:36:43.498, Speaker C: Maybe it's multimodal, right? Like maybe it is a moment where you're on your phone reading text and then you go back. I mean, I don't know. I certainly think some kind of deep Three D experience will be an essential part of it. And I have always been more bullish personally on VR than AR for this use case. Because if you're going to go in the Metaverse, you want to go in the metaverse, you don't want to see your couch and your coffee pod. Like you probably want to go all the way in the virtual experience. And so no, I personally think it will be 3D virtual experiences in VR and new interfaces.
00:36:43.498 - 00:36:50.766, Speaker C: It could be brain interfaces, it could be whatever it might be. But the trend certainly seems to be to deeper and deeper immersion, right? Like why wouldn't it be?
00:36:50.868 - 00:38:02.870, Speaker B: I watch my children and the way that they interact in the Oculus, which I'm super open to, but even in an Oculus, I think old people, we have this prevailing wisdom that if kids are playing games inside that they're wasting their lives. I think, first of all, we have a whole generation of people already in their twenty s and thirty s who would suggest otherwise. However, what I'm watching are these kids locking in to a digital real that's not fully rendered Three D, and you are experiencing it synchronously and persistently, but it's not a fully rendered 3D world, so you don't have a sense of presence quite yet. However, Roblox Minecraft, those are social gaming experiences as much as they are, and storytelling experiences, and you are interacting with characters that have been created, but you're also socializing, but you're also gaming. Now imagine a time of course it's been imagined in Sci-fi for years where you can really tap into that. I find that riveting and I feel like specifically Adam is and was created to facilitate a narrative experience in that world.
00:38:02.940 - 00:38:21.870, Speaker A: That's fantastic. I just want to make one note on The Ready Player, one analogy. I'm a huge fan of the book and the movie. I didn't read the second book. But one thing that does strike me is that the Oasis, which is where the Ready Player, one universe plays out, is owned by a single corporation. And I would just put a point of differentiation here that with Web Three, it would not be that.
00:38:21.940 - 00:38:43.794, Speaker B: I mean, that's the entire premise of the book, which is that it was created by a benevolent creator, nevertheless still an authoritarian, and then he passes on and then the whole movie is about who's going to control the Oasis. And that's one of Matthew's very big concerns as it is in anybody in the space, which is if you get these massive, whoever it might be, tech.
00:38:43.832 - 00:38:48.630, Speaker A: Conglomerates I mean, let's just say it. Let's call it meta. Let's just say it out loud.
00:38:48.970 - 00:38:51.320, Speaker B: I'm not going to pick a fight.
00:38:52.490 - 00:38:53.634, Speaker A: We will with meta.
00:38:53.682 - 00:39:08.518, Speaker B: That's your job. I literally work for Apple and Disney right now. I see a world where we're all working together. Come on. No, but I truly do I do feel like there's no I don't.
00:39:08.614 - 00:39:10.346, Speaker A: I don't think it's either or. I agree with you.
00:39:10.368 - 00:39:27.374, Speaker B: There's room for everybody, I think, if people are open to it and I think Chris's point is that people are not, which I understand, but I think that people in the entertainment space are open at this point to a myriad of possibilities. Otherwise they're going to get swallowed. Whereas I think some of the big tech companies, they don't have as much fear of that.
00:39:27.492 - 00:40:04.586, Speaker C: So I do think I mean, I don't want to keep saying the same thing, but I do think the architecture of that world is important. And specifically, the question you brought out, should it be kind of Oasis style? Ready player one. I think at the end, didn't they end with they split the keys among the five protagonists, so they had like a multi SIG, and they shut it down on and they shut it down on, like, Thursdays or something, which is probably like to hang out in the real world. Not optimal. Like, you should just create an experience that doesn't need to be shut down. But I think, for example, it could be like the early web was, where anyone can put up a website and anyone can put up a house, whatever. A digital lot, a plot of land, a world, whatever it might.
00:40:04.586 - 00:40:45.378, Speaker C: Be and that there's some kind of standards and I think probably blockchains and NFTs and other kinds of things which let you kind of interoperate between them, let people have real economics, let them really build businesses, build lives, have some kind of governing know? I think an analogy we like to use is like we're in New York City right now. One of the beautiful things about New York City to me is it's a city that evolved organically. It evolved in many little plots of land. I mean, some of it was city planning, right? It was roads and sidewalks and parks, and those are very important. But then it was you divvy up everything into little NFTs, and people come along and they buy them and they decide to invest in them, and they build things. They interoperate and they interact. And you have this really interesting kind of interplay between the public and the private.
00:40:45.378 - 00:40:56.126, Speaker C: If you didn't have the sidewalk, you wouldn't have the stores, right? You wouldn't want someone to own the sidewalk. And you'd have all sorts of weird and that evolved in a way that I think you don't really see in planned cities. There have been attempts to do it.
00:40:56.148 - 00:40:58.622, Speaker A: And think about theme they've actually failed all the planned yeah.
00:40:58.676 - 00:41:29.814, Speaker C: So I think it's important for a lot of reasons, including the fact that I think it'll be a much more interesting and popular and successful metaverse if you let it kind of grow organically and be community owned and be built on standards. And I think right now, actually, we're at the point we're probably at the critical moment for making these decisions right now because when these things happen in tech, they happen very quickly, right? I mean, they happen gradually than suddenly, right? Like these smartphones coming along, okay, it's this niche thing and then boom, everyone's got a smartphone, right? When it happens, it's going to happen. And now is probably the time for figuring out what's the architecture of that system going to be.
00:41:29.932 - 00:41:53.840, Speaker A: So before we wrap up, I'm going to ask you guys a couple of quick lightning round, kind of a pseudocommercial break on the podcast, some quick lightning round style questions and have you guys give me quick answers on each of them. And then I'll sort of wrap us up. But kind of going to sound like it's not a segue. It's going to sound random for a second, but I have a plan, which is what's your favorite TV show or movie that you've watched recently? And you can't say your own shows.
00:41:56.050 - 00:41:57.454, Speaker B: Why would I say my own shows?
00:41:57.492 - 00:41:58.014, Speaker A: I'm just saying.
00:41:58.052 - 00:42:05.010, Speaker C: I'm just making actually, before I met Rob, I don't watch much TV. I'd actually watched all of Mythic Quest and I liked it a lot.
00:42:05.080 - 00:42:15.078, Speaker B: He had never seen Sonny. There's like three people on the planet Earth who have never seen Sonny but have watched Mythic Quest. Are you one of them? That's four. Wow.
00:42:15.164 - 00:42:30.958, Speaker C: I had like a ten year period where I was an entrepreneur, where I watched no TV and that happened to fall into that window. But I went back and watched a bunch of it and I watched the first five episodes, I honestly did. It was one of the few TV shows I've watched before I met Rob originally because I like video games and I was like, oh, it's a show about video games. That's cool. But then it was really funny and well done.
00:42:31.044 - 00:42:35.546, Speaker B: I don't know, does it hold up those early seasons? That was a different time. Chris.
00:42:35.578 - 00:42:36.894, Speaker A: So your answer is Mythic quest.
00:42:36.932 - 00:42:39.920, Speaker B: What was your we were just talking about Deadwood that you've been watching.
00:42:40.370 - 00:42:48.500, Speaker C: Everyone says you got to watch Deadwood and I hadn't ever seen it. And of course I immediately was thinking about how the plots of land were like NFTs and cities and everything else.
00:42:49.750 - 00:43:33.022, Speaker B: But I do the same thing. So I'm watching Stranger Things with my kids because they're just now at the age where it's not terrifying, but it's still fucking terrifying. These kids are so young, and I'm not sure I'm a good parent, but we're watching them all together right before bed. But the reason that that show works so well is that it's tapping into the nostalgia, the things that we loved when we were kids. And now we can pass those on because they transcend generations. And you're watching a show about a community of kids who were like the outcast that got together, but they're also using the way that we interacted with story at the time to pull us in. So now there's this massive community of people who love Stranger Things.
00:43:33.076 - 00:44:02.134, Speaker A: Oh my God, I'm so glad you mentioned nostalgia because that's one of the lightning rounds on my list because I'm obsessed with that topic. And I finished Chuck Klosterman's the 90s. Everyone and my team is obsessed and tired of hearing me talk about this book because I love it so much, but I love it for the nostalgia. And one question I have for you guys about that. It's a book called the 90s by Chuck Clausterman. I guess we're all Gen Xers on stage and it's really much about us, but it's also fascinating. And this goes to your point about Stranger Things and your kids coming to it at the right time.
00:44:02.134 - 00:44:28.066, Speaker A: I'm obsessed with this idea that people come back to things that they never experienced. And even on our team, there are people who are like 20 years younger who are suddenly rediscovering the culture and vapor wave and cipher punk and all these cool things. And I'm very struck by this phenomenon. And do you guys have any theories or just quick lightning round thoughts on nostalgia? And if you even have a thesis about how your kids can experience something that you loved as a kid but yet have no reference, well, I can.
00:44:28.088 - 00:45:04.682, Speaker B: Tell you just in going through the applications for Adam, what we're finding that's really fascinating is that I truly thought there was going to be a lot of people that were suggesting super just because of the massive success of superhero movies. And it feels like that's what we're asking for is like, to create superheroes heroes. Not at all what we're getting. We're getting human beings. We're getting some it's kind of an even mix between villains and heroes. I mean, as portrayed in the movies, protagonists and antagonists. And I would say that the vast majority of them are movies that people connected with when they were younger.
00:45:04.682 - 00:45:25.970, Speaker B: Interesting, because when you are forced to ask yourself that question, and that was done on purpose, which was, we're not looking for writers. We're looking for something that touched you. And if you can explain and do a little self actualization and try to understand why you connected with that character, then you have the ability to create a version of that.
00:45:26.040 - 00:45:30.054, Speaker A: Very interesting thesis. McElheny's rule number two. Just kidding. Keep going.
00:45:30.172 - 00:46:06.030, Speaker B: So what we're finding is that people are coming out and saying, I connected with this character at 8910 1112 13 at those formative times where you're taking a narrative, but it's also when you're trying to figure out who you are and the kind of person you want to be or the person you don't want to be. And who is it that's having those impacts in popular culture? And those are the kinds of characters that we're getting. So I think nostalgia plays directly into that. The reason we love this is that we're still trying to hold on to or recreate consciously or subconsciously the things we had in our youth.
00:46:06.110 - 00:46:31.490, Speaker A: But just to make sure I double underline what you just said there and the Mcelheni's rule number two here it's also what you're saying is that the ability to then be aware of and know what you're connecting with, is actually another indicator that you may be able to be one of those, one out of ten who can then take those ideas and actually create things from them. Which is also a very interesting extension because it does open up the world of creators.
00:46:31.570 - 00:47:11.142, Speaker B: Yes. Or you could even go a step further, which we're trying to do now, which is to go through some of the applications that were originally we said, well, this isn't up to the standard of some of the others. We dug a little deeper, which is they might not know the right questions to ask themselves beyond who's your favorite character? Because sometimes people are even intimidated by writing 500 words. So you could put up a video of you explaining it. But really what you're asking somebody as this is the most important part, is who are you? Because the truth is you have a story whether you know how to tell it or not. We know how to ask the right questions and people are just fascinated. Everybody's fascinated and everybody has something to add.
00:47:11.196 - 00:47:12.386, Speaker A: That's fascinating.
00:47:12.498 - 00:48:04.530, Speaker C: On nostalgia, one thing I think about a lot is when you look at really impactful technologies in history. So like the automobile, the real impact of the automobile was like 30 years later when suburbs and highway systems so I think social media is probably a technology that is at the scale of the automobile in importance. And I think we've seen some of the second order effects playing out. So for example, in politics, I think everyone has seen that this has clearly changed the way the politics works and I think we are only beginning to understand how it's changing culture. I haven't fully thought this through, but my feeling is kind of part of the nostalgia is kind of a yearning for a time when there was a centralized kind of narrative. There used to be the media and there was a thing and there were stars and maybe there were sub narratives, but there was sort of a narrative, right? And the Internet's kind of collapsed all that. You can experience any ear at the same time, everyone's sort of fragmented into sub communities.
00:48:04.530 - 00:48:13.082, Speaker C: I think some of it maybe it's just the age thing or something, but I feel like some of the nostalgia and something like strangers things also is for a time when it was just sort of simpler and there was like.
00:48:13.216 - 00:48:15.082, Speaker A: Yes, there were like ten TV shows.
00:48:15.136 - 00:48:24.170, Speaker C: And ten things and ten top 40 music. And it was like just sort of a unified culture. And now it's this kind of complicated thing that we don't fully understand.
00:48:24.240 - 00:49:09.180, Speaker A: That's fascinating that you say that, because when I was at Wired, I edited an op ed by Douglas Rushkoff on narrative collapse. And one of his theses was that Netflix and Binge culture was yet another form of narrative collapse, as was Game of Thrones, by turning a TV show into essentially a big game that didn't necessarily have an ending. Hence, like, the whole mess at the end when they had to accelerate the storyline and all that stuff. So I'm going to skip the last one and actually bring it back to Adam and Rob. You didn't actually finish your story when you were telling us your story of how you got to Web Three. You started with Dixon and the podcast that you liked, but I would love for you to close a thread for how you took that. And this is including building on everything we've been talking about here, your kids, and the experiences of watching.
00:49:09.180 - 00:49:14.382, Speaker A: Like, how does this all come together to you and how you actually started? Adam yeah.
00:49:14.436 - 00:50:01.974, Speaker B: So I was at a point in my career, in life, again, I've just been very fortunate. And I realized that I had spent a lot of my life just building television shows that I was both writing, producing, and acting in. And it was a blast. But I realized that I just did 15 seasons of a show. What am I going to spend the next 15 years of my life doing? And it just seemed really worthwhile to help other people to find their own path, to be able to do exactly what I was doing, which was, again, whatever their version of it might be. And so one of my kids actually both of my kids were taught by the same woman named Keanu Taylor. And she is a teacher at my kids'school.
00:50:01.974 - 00:50:25.538, Speaker B: And she was everybody's favorite teacher. She was the kid's favorite teacher. Everybody loved her. And I don't know, three, four years in, she did something up on a stage where it was a presentation for the kids, and she made a comment that she was a comedy writer. And I'd known her for four years by this point. So I go up to her afterwards and I say, keanu, do you know what I do for a living? And she said, yeah. I said, Why have you not told me that? And she said.
00:50:25.538 - 00:50:40.842, Speaker B: Well, I thought it was inappropriate because I'm teaching your kids. And I was like, well, now I instantly fall in love with her even more. But I say, hey, send me your stuff. She does it's undeniable. And we hired her for Mythic Quest. She then wrote for Sonny as well. She was a part of that 10%.
00:50:40.842 - 00:51:17.474, Speaker B: She created her own show, which she's now making at FX. So there was a clear path, at least in my mind, for her to go from teaching, which is a wonderful position, but her dream was to make her own TV show. So I look at that and I say, well, that's a clear path. Well, the four years that she already knew me, and it wasn't really clear at that point, there was also the decades before that. It was like a very clear path for me, and she didn't feel that level of access and opportunity. And so it's been just unbelievably satisfying for both of us. And she's taken the baton from there.
00:51:17.474 - 00:51:26.354, Speaker B: So you can only do that so many times because if you're just creating shows, it just takes time and there's just a level of scale that you can't achieve.
00:51:26.402 - 00:51:29.330, Speaker A: I mean, you were approximately close to her because she was yours.
00:51:29.410 - 00:51:32.962, Speaker B: Correct. Teacher there's no better access. Right.
00:51:33.036 - 00:51:34.970, Speaker A: Literally right there, yes.
00:51:35.120 - 00:51:56.914, Speaker B: And yet when I started to think, well, how can we maybe expand upon that? Yeah, you could start a production company and just look for writers. But then that's when I started, again questioning the criteria. So I'm setting my expectation of what the criteria would be for a creator. But doesn't that leave you with only your own myopic view of what something could be?
00:51:56.952 - 00:51:57.346, Speaker A: Right.
00:51:57.448 - 00:52:04.718, Speaker B: At the same time, I'm hanging out with my friend Rich Rosenblatt, who I've known for a bit, and he started this company with Tom Brady.
00:52:04.814 - 00:52:06.386, Speaker A: I believe that company is Autographed, right?
00:52:06.408 - 00:52:26.618, Speaker B: That company is Autograph. Yes. And I just didn't understand the company at all as we started. But hey, great. To each their own. But Rich said, why don't you speak to my son Chase, who's just native Web Three? And again, going back to my old adage of if you ask a young person what they're working on and you.
00:52:26.624 - 00:52:28.730, Speaker A: Listen to young mentors, I want to say it again.
00:52:28.800 - 00:52:54.914, Speaker B: Yeah. And he started pitching me something, and I'm like, I'm going to keep listening because this is what he and his community of young people are all talking about. This seems fascinating. And then he's the one that turned me on to podcasts. He turned me on to a whole different way of sort of approaching things. And then we were kind of pitching back and forth something that he was thinking and something that I had been trying to do, which was a scaled up version of the experience that we had with Keanu. And we just kind of had this light bulb moment.
00:52:54.914 - 00:53:21.366, Speaker B: I think he called Chris that day and Chris texted and said, I'll be in La tonight. I was like, These people don't fuck around. Usually in Hollywood. I'll call you next week and you don't hear from them for a month. And then within a couple of weeks, we were up and running. And I think it's just because we're just hitting that inflection point where all the things were kind of working together. And now Kiana is our chief creative officer.
00:53:21.366 - 00:53:27.450, Speaker B: She gets to not only run her own show, but build something, know, four years ago would be impossible.
00:53:27.530 - 00:53:36.298, Speaker C: And how many other Keanu's are out there? The idea that the current system is discovering all the best talent seems pretty far fetched.
00:53:36.394 - 00:53:48.146, Speaker B: And if you just think about the funnel that Keanu had to go through to get the access and even that, I mean, we were standing next to each other for five years before the gate essentially was open.
00:53:48.248 - 00:54:12.010, Speaker A: Well, I think that's a great note to end on. I just want to make sure, though, that people know what to do and where to go next if they're interested in learning or doing more on our end. At Asics and Z Crypto. Two people on our team. And there's more than that, actually. But Elena Berger, Jane Lippencott, Chris Lyons, they're all very actively involved in looking for these companies. Decentralized media, whatever we want to call it.
00:54:12.160 - 00:54:23.742, Speaker B: I like decentralized media, decentralized content creation. I think it's a misnomer insofar as the process, yes, but definitely the community itself and the ownership. 100%.
00:54:23.796 - 00:54:25.342, Speaker A: Would you have another name for it, by the way?
00:54:25.396 - 00:54:28.474, Speaker B: No, because you're going to make it a McElhenie rule or something that's going to get weirder.
00:54:28.522 - 00:54:34.682, Speaker A: I was I probably would have done a Macklehenny rule. I love that. And how do people get involved with the Atom verse?
00:54:34.746 - 00:54:36.710, Speaker B: You can go to Adamverse.com.

00:55:35.788 - 00:55:36.758, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just wondering if that.
00:55:36.764 - 00:55:44.040, Speaker B: Was like in the back of no, it's my man's. Collar. It's just getting also wait a second.
00:55:45.050 - 00:55:46.182, Speaker A: Fuck it. Hold on.

00:55:52.788 - 00:55:55.600, Speaker B: I mean, you don't tuck it down. There it goes.
00:55:58.050 - 00:55:59.514, Speaker C: It's a tech thing, you know, it's.
00:55:59.562 - 00:56:01.854, Speaker A: Composing his appearance on stage that is.
00:56:01.892 - 00:56:03.998, Speaker B: Composability and blabbering on about something.
00:56:04.084 - 00:56:04.718, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:56:04.804 - 00:56:05.760, Speaker B: You look great.
