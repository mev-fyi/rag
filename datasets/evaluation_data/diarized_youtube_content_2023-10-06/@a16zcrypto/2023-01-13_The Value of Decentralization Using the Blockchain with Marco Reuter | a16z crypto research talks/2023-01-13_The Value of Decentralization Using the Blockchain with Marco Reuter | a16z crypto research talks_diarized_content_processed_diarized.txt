00:00:12.050 - 00:00:50.626, Speaker A: We are thrilled today for our seminar to have Mako Reuter from Mannheim. He's a graduate student and I've interacted with him and his work for a while through various different market design channels. He's got quite a broad portfolio across different market design projects. But in particular when I first saw what is his job market paper footnote. He's on the job market this year, so can't say that often enough. When I first came across this job market paper, it was clearly something that we had to see. Really trying to understand a foundational question in why we use crypto and we're thrilled to have him tell us about it.
00:00:50.648 - 00:01:10.086, Speaker B: Welcome Mako. Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you so much for having me, Scott. I'll try to share my slides. Okay. Yeah, you can see the title of the paper is the Value of Decentralization Using the Blockchain. And as Scott had said, it's my job market paper, so any feedback is extra welcome.
00:01:10.086 - 00:02:15.306, Speaker B: So let me just start right away. So the question that I want to ask is suppose you're having a situation where you're thinking, oh, maybe I should make the new Facebook or the new Google. I think at a 16 z oftentimes encounter projects maybe that claim to do exactly that. So the question that I'm going to look at in this paper is, should you do so using a regular company, just make a startup and have a regular company? Or should you try to do it in a decentralized manner through the blockchain or through a blockchain? And what are the key points of the paper? The key friction is that I'm going to assume that users suffer from a locked in effect. So I join a platform, maybe a Facebook or Google, and when I want to leave again, maybe I encounter some switching costs. So that's a cost that I have. Or you can think that I search on Google every day and Google gets kind of to know what I like to search for and then I find that nice and then it's harder for me to leave.
00:02:15.306 - 00:02:50.822, Speaker B: So I become locked in over time. And the key economic problem that is going to arise is that the entrepreneur who makes the platform is going to be tempted to exploit this locked in effect. For example, by putting y advertisement. So I make a search engine and I start off and I have only the first result as advertisement. And then over time I put the second result and the third result. And I think, you know, intuitively kind of what's going on here? Or I try to sell the data and I lack commitment that I won't do it. So I can tell you today, no, I'll never do that.
00:02:50.822 - 00:03:43.674, Speaker B: But later down the line, if it becomes profitable, I will do it anyways. I can't really commit that I won't do it. And the main result of the paper is that I can use blockchain to generate such commitment and that as an entrepreneur who thinks about making such a platform, I should decentralize through a blockchain if and only if this locked in effect that the users have is sufficiently large. Are you assuming there are network effects to using this platform for users? Yes, there are going to be network effects in the model, yeah. If you have any questions at any time, super happy to just jump in. So let me go to the next slide, just listing a couple of applications. I think usually I have to explain a lot more about blockchain, but for this crowd, I think it's good to just jump into the application.
00:03:43.674 - 00:05:02.350, Speaker B: So in recent times, many decentralized alternatives to traditional companies have popped up. So on this list, on the right hand side, I've put in normal companies that I think you're all very familiar with, like AWS, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify and so on. And on the left hand side, kind of some decentralized alternatives that have been popping up like a filecoin or these kind of the paper goes into answering the question of, okay, why do we observe that? Why should I do it on the blockchain? And kind of the key feature is that for these decentralized alternatives, I'm always thinking about decentralized governance, which means that I'm trying to put the control over the network with the users. So usually I'm going to have some sort of governance mechanism that is some sort of voting. So if you have a project, you make a cryptocurrency and everybody who has tokens can vote on what's going to happen. I think lots of these projects have votes quite regularly and kind of what happens effectively is that the entrepreneur that founds the network gives away control over the network and that's going to be very important here. All right, so briefly talking a bit about the literature.
00:05:02.350 - 00:05:52.914, Speaker B: So there's kind of two strains that are important here. There's one, the economics of blockchains. It's kind of a very recent literature and kind of where I fit in is about kind of using blockchain for commitment. But what makes kind of my paper special is taking this dynamic approach of I grow my network over time and then I have these locked in effects. And then there's a bit more of a traditional literature in the I O sector about platforms because the networks or platforms that I talk about are platforms as such, but usually those are more concerned with pricing and platform competition. But let me not get into the literature too deep. So what I want to do now is kind of give you a high level overview over the model just to give you the intuitions of what's going on.
00:05:52.914 - 00:07:01.414, Speaker B: And then after that we'll go kind of dig into the details. But this for now is a bit vague on purpose just to give you the intuitions of what's going on. So what's going to happen? The entrepreneur is going to create a network and can decide, do I do it in a centralized way through like a normal company or do I decentralize? Then it's a dynamic model where over time, potential new users, they keep arriving and the old existing users, they're going to be locked in, so they find it harder to leave and it's going to be profitable to exploit this locked in effect, I-E-I put more monetization in my network. And what do I mean with centralized is the entrepreneur just decides I make a company like Facebook and the CEO wakes up in the morning and thinks putting more ads is going to be profitable, we'll make more money that way and then he just does it. That's the end of the question. And in the decentralized world here in this model, I'm going to say no, the entrepreneur doesn't have power over doing that. I'll let the users decide to do that.
00:07:01.414 - 00:07:49.110, Speaker B: So I'll have some sort of decentralized governance, maybe using a smart contract where it's like the users then decide how much monetization should the network have. So what happens in a centralized network? Here I draw a picture because I think it's going to be quite intuitive. So on the x axis you see the time, so it's going to have multiple periods, or infinitely many to be exact. And on the y axis you see how many users are in the network. And in equilibrium that we're looking at, it's going to divide into two phases. There's going to be a growth phase and then there's going to be an exploitation phase. So what happens in the growth phase is me as the entrepreneur, I can't commit that, I won't exploit your locked in effect.
00:07:49.110 - 00:08:23.422, Speaker B: But at the start there's lots of growth going on. So I implicitly gain commitment that I won't use your locked in effect. It's just much better for me to grow the network. But then as growth slows down, eventually the temptation of just monetizing my existing user base becomes very large. And in the end it's going to become so large that I'm just going to say, no, I don't really need to get more new users, I'll just monetize what I have and then I get into this exploitation just so I understand the plot.
00:08:23.486 - 00:08:35.174, Speaker C: So in principle, this blue curve keeps going and growing slowly. So this is actually a decision by the entrepreneur to switch from the blue to the red, is that right?
00:08:35.292 - 00:09:16.290, Speaker B: Exactly. Okay, all right. So the advantages for the entrepreneur in the centralized network is, well, I have full control over the monetization, but in some sense that's also the disadvantage, right? Because I lack commitment over my future monetization decisions. If I wake up tomorrow and I have 2 billion users in a network and I find it very profitable to monetize them, I'll just do it. There's no way that I'll be able to stop myself from doing it tomorrow. Then let's switch over to the decentralized network and I think connects to Tim's question. So now you see the same graph, but the blue curve just keeps growing.
00:09:16.290 - 00:10:00.562, Speaker B: So on the x axis, again, you have time, on the y axis you have the users and the decentralized network is going to have the following advantage. I can commit that I'm not going to abuse the locked in effect because I'll let the users decide on monetization. And with that I can keep growing over time. But the disadvantage is that I lose control over my monetization decision. And actually in the model I'm going to have to engage in revenue sharing. So I'll have to give away some of the revenue from the monetization, from the advertisers to my users. Why? Well, because they decide the monetization and if I give them nothing, they will just say, no monetization, please, we'll just choose zero.
00:10:00.562 - 00:10:16.950, Speaker B: So I have to give away some revenues to align preferences and lots of these projects. So for example, when you go on presearch and search, every time you search you actually get a bit of money. So there's kind of revenue sharing going on and also in many other of these projects.
00:10:18.090 - 00:10:33.306, Speaker D: I have a question here. Are you distinguishing users who are just using the network versus users who may hold some tokens in voting share, who have nominal interest or get some of the revenue, or there's the same party in the model.
00:10:33.488 - 00:10:40.960, Speaker B: In this model all users are going to be the same, so there's not going to be any difference. Okay. All right.
00:10:41.490 - 00:10:43.358, Speaker A: Although actually quick follow up on that.
00:10:43.444 - 00:10:43.838, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:43.924 - 00:11:16.982, Speaker A: Seems like your model could you could imagine we haven't seen the model yet. But abusing my slight amount of knowledge of what's in the paper already, it seems like you could imagine a universe in which only some of the users hold governance and therefore they have some incentive to exploit the other users but they're subject to the same fee structure as everybody else. And so you might actually imagine that you can even get a version of this result where there's like some exploitation, but not as much as there would be under fully centralized control with partial decentralization. Is that the right intuition?
00:11:17.126 - 00:11:39.530, Speaker B: Yeah, that is exactly correct. Right. Because the users, they are still going to suffer from the monetization even if they're holding some of the tokens. Right. So they will internalize some of the exploitation they would be tempted to exert on the others. You could break this up slightly and qualitatively, nothing much changes. Awesome, thanks.
00:11:39.530 - 00:12:05.978, Speaker B: All right, perfect. Thanks for the question. So let me give you the main result of the paper just because I really want everybody to take away this result and then afterwards we'll go into the details and actually see how you get there. So the main result of paper is going to be the following proposition. There exists a well defined size of the locked in effect, it's going to be U double star here. Such that decentralized governance is preferred by the entrepreneur. I e.
00:12:05.978 - 00:12:41.290, Speaker B: Makes more money if and only if the size of the locked in effect is larger than this threshold. So if the locked in effect is very large, decentralized. If the locked in effect is small, stay centralized. That's going to be the main result. All right. And now we can jump into the model and you'll kind of see how everything works. And if at any point in time there are questions, please just interrupt and ask, so what does a model have? There's one entrepreneur that's going to be the person who makes the network.
00:12:41.290 - 00:13:14.414, Speaker B: And there's going to be a continuum of users I and in every period, the amount of users in the network, of course, might change. So it's denoted by mu t. In period t, there's mu users. It's a sequential game with infinitely many periods. So I start in period zero, one, two and keep going on forever. And the periods are slightly different because period zero is special. That's the period where the network gets created and then periods one, two and so on until infinity, they are all the same.
00:13:14.414 - 00:13:50.086, Speaker B: What happens is that the users interact in the network and the interaction is subject to a couple of key things. First of all, the level of monetization. So you can think of how many ads should I show in the network that's going to be a real number. Maybe two ads, maybe three ads. And from this amount of advertisement that I display, I can make revenues. So what are the revenues? I have this monetization level pi and I multiply it with maybe you just think about an advertising rate that is going to be phi. Phi is going to be increasing.
00:13:50.086 - 00:14:14.690, Speaker B: So if I want to advertise to more users, I have to pay more. I think it's quite intuitive. And if I don't advertise to anybody, I don't pay anything. Revenue can be shared regardless of the mode of governance. And the entrepreneur keeps share alpha t, and the rest goes to the users. And the assumption here is going to be it goes to the users evenly, so they're going to share evenly.
00:14:16.630 - 00:14:21.670, Speaker C: Sorry, musa measure or musa number? I was a little confused.
00:14:23.450 - 00:14:35.718, Speaker B: So it's going to be a number, but it's infinitely many users. Right. And then I assign the measure to how many users there are. So it's not like a natural number of 180,000 users, but it's a measure.
00:14:35.814 - 00:14:37.706, Speaker C: Okay, so for fixed t, it's a number. Yeah.
00:14:37.728 - 00:14:46.486, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Let me talk a bit about the timing and the actions. So how is monetization?
00:14:46.598 - 00:14:55.694, Speaker C: Sorry, just to follow up. So when you say fee is increasing, you mean for each fixed t. So it's increasing in mu sub t, right? I should think.
00:14:55.732 - 00:15:15.142, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Okay, all right. More users means I have to pay more for displaying advertising. All right, thanks for the questions. Okay, so timing and actions, that's where I was. So I'm going to look at how is monetization and revenue sharing decided. So in period zero, that one was special.
00:15:15.142 - 00:16:05.000, Speaker B: Where the network gets founded, the entrepreneur picks the mode of governance. So I do it in a centralized fashion or I decentralize. And then if I pick centralized in the following periods, the entrepreneur just does whatever she wants, so she just picks monetization level pi. So how many ads to display and revenue sharing alpha, how much of my revenue do I want to share with the users? If I do it in a decentralized manner, I'm going to do the following. In period T equals to zero, I pick revenue share that I'm going to share with my users right here. That's kind of the tokenomics. So the idea behind that is in period zero, I make some sort of token and I keep alpha of the tokens for myself and I give one minus alpha of the tokens to the community.
00:16:05.000 - 00:17:03.900, Speaker B: And then kind of the idea is I ask advertisers, for example, to buy tokens on the open market to pay for their advertisement so that we kind of evenly share in the price appreciation of this token. It's a bit in the corporate finance world, you would maybe say it's like a stock repurchase, in a sense. In the following periods, then, the users collectively choose the amount of monetization that they want. So the pie and yeah, that's how we choose monetization and revenue sharing. Then let's talk a little bit about user actions and user growth. How does that work? So regardless of if it's centralized or decentralized, in Arrow, the periods where the people use the network, the existing users, they can stay or leave. So they have a binary decision and new users, they can say, well, I'll join or I'll not join.
00:17:03.900 - 00:17:42.272, Speaker B: Also, binary decision and network growth is modeled as follows. So I have a growth function. So what do I do? I take the growth function G and I look at how many users did I have last period. That's the amount of users that I start with at the beginning of this period. And then the amount of users that arrives, the new potential users is G of Mu T minus one, minus Mu T minus one. And that's some sort of positive number so that's people that haven't used the network yet and they kind of just arrive to the network and if they want to join, they will join. So that the math works out the following way.
00:17:42.272 - 00:18:01.030, Speaker B: If everybody who arrives joins now, the network size is G of Mu T minus one. And if nobody of those people join, the network size stays at Mu T minus one. Again, if there's any questions somewhere, please ask.
00:18:01.400 - 00:18:05.668, Speaker D: So can Mu of T decrease if people are leaving the network here?
00:18:05.834 - 00:18:37.868, Speaker B: Yes, mut can decrease if people leave. So the existing users, they can always leave the network, so it can decrease. What's going to be in this model is users are going to be homogeneous. So if one wants to leave, everybody will leave. So if they all kind of have the same preferences in this model, it's either they all stay or they all leave. So in that sense it's a bit extreme here. All right, let's talk a bit about preferences.
00:18:37.868 - 00:19:17.432, Speaker B: So what does the entrepreneur want? The entrepreneur is purely interested in revenue. I make a large network, there's lots of money potentially to be made and that's all I'm interested in. So what's the utility period? I look at how much revenue do I keep that's alpha t, and then I look at the revenues that I make. And the revenues that I make again was pi t, the monetization I e, how many ads do I show times the advertisement rate, this phi of mu t. For users it's a bit more complicated. So there's going to be three parts to their preferences. First is usage of the network.
00:19:17.432 - 00:19:53.300, Speaker B: So I use the network and that actually gives me some utility. So if the network has measure mu t of users, then the utility for each user is v of Mu t and v of mutu is increasing. So I have some sort of network effects and if I'm the only person in the network, so if there's zero measure of users, I don't find it appealing at all. If you're on Facebook alone, that's not really very appealing. Second part is monetization. So nobody likes to look at advertisement. I think that's quite intuitive.
00:19:53.300 - 00:20:34.864, Speaker B: So what happens is if I display pi t many ads, this utility that users get is minus k times pi t squared. So some sort of convex function here and k measures, however am I at monetization. So if K is very close to zero, then I don't really care if there's monetization or if there's advertisement. And if k is very large, then I really hate it and I really don't want to have a lot of that. Last part is revenues. So if there's some sort of revenue sharing going on, I like that. How much revenue do I get? Well, the users get one minus alpha of the revenues, right? But we divide that evenly over the users.
00:20:34.864 - 00:21:26.992, Speaker B: So we divide by mu t, and then I multiply by the amount of revenues that are generated in the network. So that the utility of a user in the network is the sum of the usage utility, minus the disutility from monetization plus utility from any revenues that I can get. And here comes kind of really crucial part is when I look at the outset option, that's going to change. Now before I join the network, my outset option is normalized to zero. After I join the network, I have an outset option that is worth minus U, smaller than zero. So there's again two ways to interpret this. Either I have switching costs and they are U large, or I use the network for a period.
00:21:26.992 - 00:22:01.890, Speaker B: The algorithm learns, what do I like? And now I get kind of this extra utility U from the algorithm having learned. So comparatively, the outset option has gotten worse by U. So that's the locked in effect that I'm talking about. And agents. So the entrepreneur and the users, they maximize in pretty standard way the sum of discounted utilities. And there's a discount factor delta by which I discount future utility. Maybe that's a good point for stopping for questions in case anybody has any.
00:22:01.890 - 00:22:58.084, Speaker B: Does this factor in potential competition from other platforms that are providing, like, for the sake argument, identical services but with less monetization and therefore less disutility? Yeah. So the other platforms, they're implicitly in here a bit for the outside option, but of course that's very implicit and very kind of reduced form. So I'm not really modeling explicitly what monetization do the other platforms pick and so on. That would probably be a very interesting next step, but it's not in this model yet, so I can't comment on that much. Okay, thanks. All right, thanks for the question. Let's move on.
00:22:58.084 - 00:23:33.520, Speaker B: So what's the solution concept that we're going to use? It's going to be subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. And then we need to talk about strategies, right? So what's the strategy for the entrepreneur? So I need to look at the possible histories of the game. So I need to look at what has happened for the entrepreneur. What's really going to be the driver of the strategy is I need to look at how many users do I have and these histories. I need to map into the following. If it's a history that terminates at period zero, I need to make a governance decision. I e.
00:23:33.520 - 00:24:14.200, Speaker B: Make it centralized or decentralized. And if it's a history that terminates in kind of a centralized game, I need to decide for a degree of monetization for the period and for a degree of revenue sharing. And if it terminates in a decentralized game, well, then I only at the start, make my decision of revenue sharing. And in the future, user is going to vote on monetization. So I don't need to do anything. And kind of the point here why subgame perfection is really nice, is that, well, strategies here need to be sequentially optimal. So I don't have any commitment of future monetization or revenue sharing.
00:24:14.200 - 00:25:06.072, Speaker B: I need to be sequentially optimal for every history. So again, if I wake up and for some reason I have 2 billion users and it's very profitable to exploit them, I will do it because it's sequentially optimal. All right, then let's go to the users. So what do I need to do for them? I need to map the possible histories of the game into a decision to stay or leave if I'm an existing user in the network, I need to make a decision to join or not join. If somehow at that history I'm just newly arriving and if the platform has decided to be decentralized, I need to vote for a degree of monetization. Pikey okay, so let me give you a quick roadmap of what we are going to do. First, I'll take you through the centralized governance subgame.
00:25:06.072 - 00:26:08.960, Speaker B: So what happens if the entrepreneur decides to do it in a centralized manner? Then I'll do the decentralized governance subgame. I e. Suppose the entrepreneur decentralizes, what happens? And then once we know what happens in both the subgames, we can look at, okay, in T equals to zero, what should I do as a governance decision? Should I stay centralized or should I decentralize? So let me give you the exact timing of a particular period in the centralized governance subgain. So, if the entrepreneur chooses centralized governance, every period has the following timing. First, the entrepreneur chooses the level of monetization and the fraction of revenue sharing for that period. Users can observe that for that one period and then they make a simultaneous choice. Everybody who has arrived in that period decides do I join or do I not join? And everybody is already in the network decides do I stay or do I leave? And then utilities realize for that period.
00:26:08.960 - 00:27:03.760, Speaker B: All right, before we can kind of say what the equilibrium is, we have to think about a couple of preliminaries. And one preliminary that's going to be quite important is the following. So look at the entrepreneur's problem to maximize revenue, just myopically for one single period where I want to make sure that every user has a utility level you had from using the network while the network size is muting. So that consideration is going to be quite important and you can calculate it, but the details aren't super relevant here. So I'll just say we'll denote that revenue that I can make with mut users that are supposed to get uhat, utility as PSI of mut. And uhat.
00:27:06.500 - 00:27:13.140, Speaker C: I think of uhat, as like the threshold where the existing users are indifferent between staying or leaving.
00:27:15.160 - 00:27:52.640, Speaker B: So for now it can be arbitrary. But of course the thresholds are going to be the relevant utility levels that I'll set as the entrepreneur. So can be anything in this kind of formulation here. But you're very right, it's going to be the thresholds that will be relevant. Okay, then I make one assumption in the model, which is the following. So I take phi t phi of mu t divided by mu t. So what was that? I take the advertisement rate and I divide by how many users I'm advertising to and that's non decreasing.
00:27:52.640 - 00:28:47.376, Speaker B: What does it do in the model? Well, it ensures that if I have more users actually want to grow because I can make more revenue from that. And of course it's important to look at, well, when does it hold? When doesn't that hold? So if you would put a very standard cost per view or cost per click advertisement model on there, you would actually get a constant fraction there. And that's kind of fine for the assumption. So kind of for very popular models of advertisement, this works. Okay. Second preliminary that we should talk about is well, how large should I grow my network? Right? I'm a centralized entrepreneur and I always have this temptation of abusing the locked in effect. But I don't want to do so right away with zero users because then I don't make any money because I can't sell advertisement.
00:28:47.376 - 00:29:52.440, Speaker B: So I definitely want to grow a little bit. But the question is how large exactly? For that we'll look at the following definition that I'll explain to you. So, what I'm going to define here is a threshold network size mu bar. And this threshold network size balances off the following two considerations. First consideration is, I have this expression, right? So PSI was the function that gives me profits per period and is coefficient of one divided by one minus delta that comes from geometric series, right? I do this for all eternity. So I get that much in today's value and what do I get? Well, I have mu bar users because I'm not growing anymore and I'm exploiting the locked in effect. And then it goes into the direction of the question that Tim had asked well, how much utility am I giving? Right? And the answer is, well, I'll just keep them indifferent between staying or leaving.
00:29:52.440 - 00:30:30.630, Speaker B: So if they leave, they have to pay U in switching costs. So if I give them utility minus one minus delta times U, that just makes them indifferent between staying and leaving. So the other consideration that I can have is, well, maybe I'll grow the network one last time before I exploit this locked in effect. Then I have two components here. Again, the PSI functions, the revenue functions are going to be the important part. You see, the first argument of the function is not mu bar anymore, but it's g of mu bar. So I grow the network one last time.
00:30:30.630 - 00:31:07.344, Speaker B: The second part of the addition here, you see, I do exactly the same. I give everybody a utility level of minus one minus delta U to keep them a difference between staying or leaving. But today, when I grow one last time, I need to compensate. I know that today when they are freshly arriving at the network, the outset option is worth zero. And if I want them to join, I need to give them at least zero utility. They know in the future they will be exploited, right? So they will get minus U. So today I need to compensate them for that.
00:31:07.344 - 00:31:38.488, Speaker B: So I give them delta times U in utility. And now for this talk, I will just say suppose mu bar. Is well defined in the paper. I go into much more detail with that. And kind of the intuition that you should have in mind for when mu bar is well defined is that when growth slows down over time, I will get to this point. So maybe at start I have very rapid growth. So kind of growing is always going to be very nice.
00:31:38.488 - 00:32:00.316, Speaker B: So not going to have this problem that I would rather exploit. But when growth slows down over time, eventually I will get to this point mu bar, where I would in the future rather exploit them and not grow anymore. So that's the intuition behind when is mu bar well defined, I forget.
00:32:00.348 - 00:32:02.370, Speaker C: Marco, do you have some assumptions on G?
00:32:03.940 - 00:32:39.788, Speaker B: Not at the start. So G is just kind of increasing. People come along. But for mu bar to be well defined, g needs to be decreasing over time. And that's maybe not very satisfying because it's not a very mathematical assumption, but the kind of math behind this is a bit more involved. So I would just want to push the intuition that it needs to decrease over time. All right, let me move on to what's the equilibrium? Right now we've gotten some preliminaries out of the way.
00:32:39.788 - 00:33:19.668, Speaker B: Now we can look at what is the equilibrium. So following proposition, suppose that some condition holds for now, ignore it. I will tell you afterwards why it's important and what happens when it fails. Then I get the following strategies for a subcamp perfect Nash equilibrium. The entrepreneur strategy is going to be in three parts. The first part is as follows and what decides the parts is you see here the amount of users that are in the network. So if I start with an amount of users that is so small that I know that tomorrow I will still want to grow even though I don't have commitment, I just know that tomorrow is still going to be optimal to grow.
00:33:19.668 - 00:34:21.340, Speaker B: I set monetization and revenue sharing to maximize revenue given by the SPI function and I do it with the following two parameters. I give a user utility level uhat, of zero and I do it for a network size where I anticipate that everybody's going to join. So that's part of the growth phase. Then the second part is now the network has grown so large in this part here that I know that I'm growing one last time, I know I can grow one more time and after that I will just find it much better to exploit. So what do I need to do? I need to set a monetization and revenue sharing such that everybody now gets a utility level delta U, right? I'm compensating because they will be exploited in the future. But still everybody is going to join because they're indifferent between joining and not. And the tiebreaker here is they will just join if they're indifferent.
00:34:21.340 - 00:35:00.128, Speaker B: And the last part is now my network is very large. It's larger than Mu bar, so I'm not going to grow anymore. So what do I do? We've seen that also before in the trade off. I set a user utility level of minus one, minus delta times U, and I do it for the network size where I know nobody's going to join anymore. It's not good for the users to join anymore. So the entrepreneur strategy, if you think back about the pictures that I've shown you at the start, has these two parts to it. There's one growth phase that are the first two bullet points here and then there's the exploitation phase.
00:35:00.128 - 00:35:30.980, Speaker B: That was the red part. That's the last bullet point here. So just keep the picture basically in mind and that's the math of the picture. Then for the users, the strategy goes as follows in the period when I arrive to the network, I will look at how many users there are. Right. Because that's important to know whether or not the entrepreneur is going to exploit or not. And if the amount of users is rather small, I anticipate that the entrepreneur is going to grow in the future.
00:35:30.980 - 00:36:23.910, Speaker B: So I'm fine with getting a user utility level of zero. But then the second part of the strategy is, oh, I see, the network is quite large already, so the entrepreneur is going to exploit in the future. So I'll only join if you compensate me for the exploitation of the future. So I want delta U in utility, and if I'm already locked into the network, well, then I'll stay basically if I'm indifferent between staying or leaving. And what does that mean? I need to get a utility level of at least this minus one, minus delta times U, so that if this always happens in the future, I have minus U and I'm indifferent between staying and leaving. So I think the equilibrium in math may be a bit difficult. So if there's any questions, please go ahead.
00:36:25.000 - 00:37:14.772, Speaker A: I guess one of the things that's wacky and kind of special about the framework here is that outside of an equilibrium framework, if U is sufficiently large, then you want to exploit the users as much as possible. Right. If you don't have to worry about users being rational about joining the platform, then you would just exploit them as much as possible. And the more locked in they are, the more you can exploit them. I guess if you have an effect where the network effect of the platform grows, essentially the outside option gets worse and worse the more people are on the platform. That compounds all the effects you're showing here, right. That somehow in equilibrium, people should be even more concerned about joining because they sort of it's not introspect exactly, but they understand an expectation that it's going to be even harder to leave than they might think, or something like that.
00:37:14.906 - 00:37:35.724, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great point. So right here the kind of outset option or the locked in effect is fixed, but I can make it dependent on the users. And if it gets worse with more users, then as you had rightly said, actually the commitment problem gets worse. So basically you can do it, but qualitatively the model stays the same or.
00:37:35.762 - 00:37:45.052, Speaker A: Actually the prediction gets stronger. Right. It's more than qualitatively the same. It's actually like you're tying your hands against the finding.
00:37:45.116 - 00:38:24.940, Speaker B: Cool, thanks. Yeah, well, perfect. Thanks. Okay, last point that I want to make is in the proposition you see at the very start I have suppose that kind of these parameters are larger than delta U. So delta U was the amount of utility that I basically give to compensate before exploit the users. And if this inequality doesn't hold, I actually don't make enough revenue in the network to pay this compensation. And then what happens as an effect is that if this U is sufficiently large that the inequality doesn't hold, actually nobody will join in equilibrium because they know I can't pay the compensation.
00:38:24.940 - 00:39:20.620, Speaker B: So for really large levels of you actually I don't get any users and that's really bad for centralized governance already that was centralized governance. Next up is decentralized governance. So how does that subgame work? And let me again give you the timing to catch you up with what happens. So if the entrepreneur chooses decentralized governance in T equals to zero, she's going to pick this unchangeable level of revenue sharing I-E-I keep half the currency or I keep 40% or whatever and I give the rest to the users. And actually that I do it at an unchangeable level is without loss of generality. It's not really obvious that it is, but in the paper I kind of show in an extension that it actually is. So for here, just think doing alpha constant is without loss of generality.
00:39:20.620 - 00:39:48.260, Speaker B: Then the following periods have the following timing. Users, again, they make a simultaneous choice. Those that are not present in the network, I e. Those that freshly arrive, they choose to join or not join. And those that are already present in the network, they can stay or leave. Then everybody's in the network that wants to join or that doesn't want to leave. And then users collectively choose the amount of monetization that they want to have for the network.
00:39:48.260 - 00:40:32.544, Speaker B: And then utilities realize, okay, here we can go to the equilibrium a bit faster. Why? Well, because we can focus on equilibria and undominated strategies. So what does that intuitively mean? Well, users in this model, they're actually homogeneous, so they should actually be able to agree on what do they want. So if I do voting here, I'm just going to tell them vote truthfully or vote as if you were pivotal. And there's a bit of a mathematical reason behind that as well. Namely, if I vote in a voting game with a continuum of users, I'm never going to be pivotal. So I don't know if you're not familiar with voting games, usually you have to condition on being pivotal and then make an optimal decision.
00:40:32.544 - 00:41:19.748, Speaker B: But in the continuum I'm never pivotal so I can basically do anything. And then for this game I should just do what I actually want to happen. And what is it that I want to happen is the following I find the subgame perfect equilibrium such that one newly arriving users, they will always join the network. So I don't have these growth and exploitation phases where they can just keep growing. And every period the users of the network will vote for a degree of monetization that is this pi t star here. And what does it depend on? Of course it depends on the amount of revenue sharing that the entrepreneur does. So if the entrepreneur keeps 100% of the revenue for herself, that means alpha is equal to one.
00:41:19.748 - 00:42:06.820, Speaker B: In this expression you plug in alpha is equal to one. Users actually say no monetization, please, I don't get anything from that and that's just annoying. Please, no ads. So the entrepreneur is actually going to have to share revenues to get a positive amount of monetization. And if you do the math and the model here turns out that I want to share half of the revenue with the users, or if you want to think in terms of token, I give away half the token that I have to the users and the network. And again, this revenue sharing is necessary to align the preferences, right? If I don't share money and the users get to decide monetization, they will not vote for any monetization. So I share some here it's half to align preferences.
00:42:06.820 - 00:42:53.420, Speaker B: All right? So now what we know is what happens in the centralized governance subgame. We know what happens in the decentralized governance subgame, right? So now we can go to the kind of big question that the paper had should I centralize or should I decentralize? Go back to period zero. Let's recap what we know so far in the centralized governance subgame. I had argued, or I had shown you that when U gets very large and this kind of condition and the equilibrium didn't hold, actually I don't get any users. So network with no users, that's going to be very bad. So there's no revenue. So kind of that's the first indication of when U is very large I should decentralize.
00:42:53.420 - 00:43:32.828, Speaker B: Why? Well, decentralized governance I'd shown you always has some revenue because it always has users and it has user growth. So the first conclusion that we can draw is when you is very large, I should decentralize. Well, how does that generalize, right? We would want to know much more not just what happens for a very large use. So it's actually good to look at the other end. Suppose there is just no locked in effect, there is no problem at all. And if there is no locked in effect to exploit decentralized entrepreneur actually doesn't have any problem. And you get kind of the following result.
00:43:32.828 - 00:44:15.532, Speaker B: It's not very surprising that as the size of the locked in effect goes to zero, I always want to stay centralized. Why? I don't have a commitment problem, right? The downside of centralization goes away, but I keep control over the monetization and I don't engage necessarily in revenue sharing. So that's better for me for sure. So there is no reason to decentralize if there is no commitment problem. So now what we know is kind of the two ends of the spectrum. U equals to zero, stay centralized, u equals to large enough, however large that may be decentralized, but we don't know the in between yet. And the in between is also kind of interesting part.
00:44:15.532 - 00:45:11.100, Speaker B: So now we want to cover the in between. This is kind of recapping what I said. Very large use, decentralized, very small use, stay centralized. What about intermediate levels? And this is where we get back to the proposition that I'd shown you at the kind of medium. Part of the talk after I'd shown you the pictures is that I can find a well defined size of the locked in effect U double star such that I should decentralize if and only if the size of the locked in effect is larger than that. And this is kind of the only part of the paper that I really also want to give you a proof sketch because that's the cool main result. So I think we should find out a bit how does it actually work? And for the proof it's going to be very useful that we know both extremes, right? We know at U equals to zero I centralize, at U very large, I decentralize.
00:45:11.100 - 00:46:00.108, Speaker B: And then what we do is we make the following observation actually the revenue in the decentralized network is independent of you. Why does that hold? Well, users don't abuse their own locked in effect, so for them it actually doesn't matter how large it is. So the revenue is actually independent of that. Then the second step in the proof goes as follows I look at revenue in the centralized network and I show that it's actually decreasing in you. And then I start above, right at zero, and then I decrease and I end below. And if it's kind of continuous, I get a point of indifference, I get this threshold. So now why is it decreasing? There's two effects that we should discuss.
00:46:00.108 - 00:47:00.428, Speaker B: There's a first order effect which goes as follows, right? In the last period of growth I had to give utility level delta times U to the users so that they will join. And what did I get from exploiting in the future? Well, I was able to extract minus one minus delta times U every period in the future. But kind of what it turns out is that actually the revenues that I make are going to be concave and how much I can extract from the users, so that it's actually going to be more costly to compensate upfront compared to what I get out in the end from exploiting. So that's an overall negative effect for revenue. And kind of the second effect that I have is that a smaller network size actually means that I have smaller revenues. So how does that work? Well, so I had this mu bar. This is kind of the size of how large I grow my network.
00:47:00.428 - 00:47:51.196, Speaker B: And what I show in the paper is that this mu bar is actually also decreasing in the locked in effect. So for a larger locked in effect, the temptation becomes increasingly large so that I will start exploiting earlier, I will grow less tall or less large my network. So mu bar goes smaller, I add a smaller network size and that's also bad for revenues. So eventually here from that intuition, I start above with centralization at U equals to zero, then it decreases. It's going to be continuous here in U and eventually I'm below and that's how I get this nice cut off. All right, that was the main result. So now I want to quickly talk about welfare.
00:47:51.196 - 00:48:52.000, Speaker B: That's always something we're interested in as well. So far I just talked about what does the entrepreneur want to do? But maybe we should also look at what should one do in terms of welfare here? First I want to look at the criterion of pareto efficiency. That's usually the minimum that economists care about. If something is not pareto efficient, we get a bit angry and say we should be pareto efficient. So I get the following corollary with the analysis that we've done so far is that decentralized governance of the network is a pareto improvement over centralized governance if and only if I have the same relation that the size of the locked in effect is larger than U double star. And the reasoning behind that is fairly simple. Well, the users, they always like decentralized governance more because in centralized governance they're actually always indifferent between joining and not joining.
00:48:52.000 - 00:49:24.736, Speaker B: So they get zero utility overall. While in decentralized governance, if you do the math a bit, it's not hard to show that every period they get positive utilities. So users always like that. And then for pareto efficiency I just need to look at, well, who else is in the model, the entrepreneur. And then I get the same threshold, right? Because only the entrepreneur matters here. For operator efficiency to decide which mode of governance is better, then the second welfare criterion that we're usually interested in is utilitarian welfare. I e.
00:49:24.736 - 00:49:58.728, Speaker B: We just sum up the utilities of the users and the entrepreneur first result. There is of course, if we have a pareto improvement, we also get a utilitarian welfare improvement. So if the size of the locked in effect is larger than U double star. We should also decentralize from a utilitarian point of view. But if the size of the locked in effect is smaller then actually the effect is ambiguous. Well, why is it ambiguous? Well, users get higher utility. I had argued for that.
00:49:58.728 - 00:51:02.892, Speaker B: But the entrepreneur gets lower utility because she makes less revenue. And then it really depends on you actually have to run the math and you have to make some functional assumptions and kind of calculate which effect is stronger here in general it's kind of hard to say. So the effect is ambiguous here. Can go both ways. All right, let me conclude what did I ask in this paper? So the question was when should an entrepreneur decentralize using the blockchain? The answer that I've given you this was the main result is decentralize if and only if the locked in effect of the users is sufficiently large. And I had argued well then the commitment that the blockchain provides is valuable if there is this locked in effect that can be exploited. And the very last bullet point that I want to give you is I want to name once again companies that have these decentralized counterparts and you can make your own opinion on whether or not the story makes sense.
00:51:02.892 - 00:51:17.810, Speaker B: So I had AWS, I had Google, I had Facebook, Twitter and Spotify. So thanks for listening and that's the talk from my side and I would be super happy about any comments and questions. Thanks.
00:51:25.460 - 00:52:27.016, Speaker C: Maybe one question. This is sort of something that Scott already brought up but I feel like there's some conceptual overlap between the roles of little U and capital, right? So Scott was basically saying like what if little U like capital V depended on the network? So on the flip side, one thing that's a little bit unnatural about your U is this kind of step function. As soon as you join it goes from something zero to something nontrivial whereas you'd sort of expect something more gradual. So I'm just wondering if I'm wondering if actually there's some version of this where the primitive, rather than having this sort of phase transition of U, you want to characterize something which is basically like capital V minus U as a function of the network size. And then somehow now it's not a one dimensional thing anymore, but you know what I mean? Kind of again, I sort of two sides. Any thoughts on that?
00:52:27.198 - 00:53:02.132, Speaker B: Yeah, so for the first part right, you so I kind of talked a bit about when Scott asked I can make you dependent on the user size as well. So if you is increasing in it, I can get a model that goes into very similar direction. And the reason is that at the very start when the network was small, I didn't even have a commitment problem at all. I was intrinsically motivated to grow. And if you is kind of small then as well. That doesn't change much. And when the network kind of was growing here, that's when I get the commitment problem.
00:53:02.132 - 00:53:57.108, Speaker B: And if now also the size of the locked in effect kind of gets very large there, then that's just worse for me so that I can somewhat easily do the second part about having this kind of step function approach. It's very nice for convenience to get the mathematical result but of course you may think this builds up over time a little bit. I think the story will still go kind of through but the math would be a bit more complicated. So I was thinking about maybe putting this into continuous time and having it build up over time and so on. Yeah, I haven't done it yet or I don't know if I will, but I think it's certainly interesting. But I think kind of the main story of the paper that I have this commitment problem over time. I think no matter how you model it, it's still going to shine through in the end.
00:53:57.108 - 00:54:01.320, Speaker B: So that's kind of why I went with a little bit of a simpler approach.
00:54:02.220 - 00:54:27.216, Speaker D: I had a question on the voting side. I guess in this model the entrepreneur doesn't vote at all in the monetization rate. I guess it's kind of natural to imagine in these Israelite systems that the entrepreneur might do some civil thing or somehow they end up also voting on the monetization rate even like the excuses are voting too. Do you consider if you add the entrepreneur to those votes how the equilibrium changes?
00:54:27.398 - 00:54:58.244, Speaker B: Yeah. So for this model I can actually let the entrepreneur vote as well. Why? Well, the entrepreneur gives away half the kind of revenue share or half the tokens and if I tie the voting to the tokens and I give away half and it's the majority vote, I'm actually not winning. Maybe I give away 50.1%. But in this equilibrium here, users, they're all going to vote for the same thing. The entrepreneur may vote for something different but the entrepreneur is actually not winning. So I can do that pretty easily.
00:54:58.244 - 00:55:17.650, Speaker B: In the model it gets more complicated of course, when users are now heterogeneous as well and the entrepreneur has a very large voting block and then maybe I need to give away a bit more or the users need to coordinate a little bit better. Then it gets more complicated. But in this model I can allow the entrepreneur to vote as well. It's not going to make a difference.
00:55:19.220 - 00:55:32.500, Speaker A: Quick follow up on that maybe. Suppose you did allow the entrepreneur to vote and they did have majority control or whatever. Presumably then they have exactly the same commitment problem they had before. And so you get back to the essentially the centralized equilibrium. Is that the right intuition?
00:55:33.080 - 00:55:33.830, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:55:35.080 - 00:55:41.284, Speaker A: So interestingly here in this model the entrepreneur would endogenously choose to not have a majority voting stake.
00:55:41.412 - 00:55:46.488, Speaker B: Exactly. I would give away more than 50%. Fascinating. Yes. Got it.
00:55:46.494 - 00:55:48.504, Speaker A: Sorry, you said that I hadn't parsed it properly. Great.
00:55:48.542 - 00:56:31.684, Speaker B: No, I should make that more specific. Probably also in the paper, right? Because it comes out very naturally here. But it's an interesting point. So I think it's good if I'm going to be a bit more specific there it yeah. Do you have any ideas of how you would measure locked, in effect, in reality in these platforms? So, personally, I don't have much ideas. I'm kind of a theorist, I haven't measured much, but there are papers, and I have them in my paper, kind of, who actually measure locked in effects. And I think some of those methods you could use also for these networks.
00:56:31.684 - 00:57:23.640, Speaker B: But for doing it, the practice, I would have to actually look into how to do it. But the people have tried and have done. Cool. Question if we have time, do the users all have the same discounted total utility, regardless of when they joined? Yes, because in the growth phase, at the very start, I get zero utility. So kind of the only parts that matter is later on, the kind of compensation and the abuse after that or the exploitation, but since after that, nobody else joins as well. Everybody's actually going to have the same utility, no matter at what point in time they join.
00:57:24.220 - 00:57:26.120, Speaker A: All right, let's thank the speaker again.
00:57:26.270 - 00:57:29.540, Speaker B: Thanks, Margaret. Thanks so much for having me. It was a pleasure.
