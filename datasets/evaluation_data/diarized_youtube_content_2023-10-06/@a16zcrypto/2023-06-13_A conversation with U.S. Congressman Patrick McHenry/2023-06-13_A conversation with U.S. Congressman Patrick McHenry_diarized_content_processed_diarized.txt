00:00:10.010 - 00:00:44.860, Speaker A: First off, thank you guys very much for sitting through an entire day of policy and regulatory stuff. I know we try to keep it as fun as we possibly can, but it can be somewhat dry. I am thrilled to introduce our next Speaker, Chairman Patrick McHenry. Chairman. McHenry is the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. He has been in Congress since 2005, I believe it's his 9th term, 10th term, almost almost 20 years in the Congress. When he was first elected, he was the youngest member of Congress at 29 years old.
00:00:44.860 - 00:01:05.070, Speaker A: And before he took over as Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, he was the Chief Deputy Whip for the House Republican Conference, which is one of the most senior leadership positions. But above all, his proudest moment of his entire career is being my former boss. So with that, one of the best people we have in Congress, chairman Patrick McHenry.
00:01:07.410 - 00:01:31.254, Speaker B: Thanks. Well, thank you Kyle. Thanks for the great introduction. Thank you all for giving me a moment to talk to you. I'm sorry you have to deal with Colin. I say that with all due respect. Colin was my Deputy Staff Director, trusted advisor, and sorry to lose him, but my loss is actually crypto's gain, frankly.
00:01:31.254 - 00:02:20.290, Speaker B: But thank you. I want to give you context for what's happening in Washington. That video tells really all that you need to know about regulatory clarity of the most important agency for crypto and his unwillingness to answer a very simple question that is a self evident question to everyone in the space and to him. He already knows the answer and he's not willing to say it. And I know that because I talked to him in private. And what he says in private versus what he's willing to testify and say in public is different, which makes me want to lose my all right, so but the context of Washington. Now, the work that is to come and the reason for just most of what you see out of Washington is just the tip of the iceberg.
00:02:20.290 - 00:03:10.730, Speaker B: It doesn't actually speak to what is happening. So you're going to see a lot of debate in the next month about the debt ceiling, whether or not the debt ceiling is going to be increased or not increased and what that means and everything else, that's just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the work of Congress happens in a very quiet way, not well covered by the press, not in the media, and it is not some largely clashing partisan moment. A lot of policy happens and a lot of policy work happens in Congress on a daily basis. And over time, you can build consensus, you can build out policy, you can build out legislation, you can pass legislation into law. So what you're getting by watching the media is just the tip of the iceberg. It doesn't speak to the sum and substance of what happens on a weekly basis in Congress or with the regulators.
00:03:10.730 - 00:04:06.234, Speaker B: So what is happening now in my committee? We're working on two major pieces of legislation that affect the world of digital assets. One is a federal framework for stablecoins. Right now, New York Department of Financial Services is the only financial regulator that has a regime for the things called stablecoins. A stablecoin is a payment regime, and it should be viewed in that light at the federal level. And we're going to have federal law. We're going to have a bill that we've worked down for the last 13 months, 14 months in Congress that we will produce out of committee in the next two months, and it'll give a federal regulatory regime for payment stablecoins. It's a lot like the New York model, because the New York model is a very good indicator of how you can actually have safety and soundness, a safe asset that is a means of payment and exchange of value.
00:04:06.234 - 00:04:27.070, Speaker B: That's one. Two, at the federal level, we have to provide two important things. One is clarity on the treatment of digital assets. You have the commodities regime with a CFTC. You have the securities regime with the SEC. There are two different sets of market structures. As you all know, they function differently.
00:04:27.070 - 00:05:25.826, Speaker B: The attributes of what is a commodity and a security are different, and there's a prove out of one regime and the other, but you firmly find yourself into one regime or the other, and it's like Hotel California. Once you check in, you can never leave. So we have to bring the clarity of what is a commodity and what is a security to the world of digital assets. And we have to have a prove out of a securities regime by which you raise capital, which is traditional to the securities regime. We have a very smart set of regulations, longstanding, that Congress updates from time to time and securities Exchange Commission updates from time to time on how you raise money. You all are very savvy and very familiar with that. We then have to have that moment by which you raise for a digital asset and that it can prove its way out to be a commodity or a security based off the attributes of that network.
00:05:25.826 - 00:06:28.034, Speaker B: It is distinct from a business startup that is an ongoing enterprise that is controlled by a narrow few that fits narrowly into the Howie test that proves you're a security. So we have to have a prove out of that regime based off the attributes of the underlying blockchain technology and the asset that is created. So we have to do that in law. Clarity of digital assets. How can you hold it? Who can hold it? You have an accounting regulation by the securities Exchange Commission today that says basically, you can't hold these assets on your books without taking a large provision of capital to hold the asset, and without a reasonable asset allocation of capital to protect that asset. It becomes an uneconomic business initiative for the banks or traditional holders of assets. So they've been pushed out of the marketplace by regulation.
00:06:28.034 - 00:07:22.570, Speaker B: So we have to fix that regulation. We have to have approve out from the securities regime to the commodities regime and a number of other factors that need to be remedied, like the debanking of crypto and crypto related companies. It's my intention to move legislation on those issues. We're going to move legislation before the 4 July, which is pretty fast for Congress, pretty slow for the work that you do, but pretty fast for Congress. And we're going to move a market structure bill that deals with securities and commodities. In Congress, though, the complicating factor is the CFTC is regulated by the AG Committee, agriculture Committee, and the SEC is regulated by my committee, the Financial Services Committee. So we have to have a joint set of policy, which means we have to cut a deal with each other, like with my committee and the chair of the AG Committee, we've cut a deal.
00:07:22.570 - 00:08:12.730, Speaker B: We have a set of principles by which we're operating and we're writing policy to those principles around how digital assets should be reasonably treated in our regime here in the United States. The pressure point for us is real, though. The pressure point on the industry is real. The competition internationally is real. United States has always been front and center and the leader in the deployment of new technology. We're the best place to raise capital, deploy capital. This is the reason why everyone in the world wants to be in the United States normally, but the rest of the world has an opportunity around crypto because we've got our heads stuck in the sand and our regulators in Washington have their heads stuck in the sand and we're behind now when it comes to digital assets.
00:08:12.730 - 00:09:11.450, Speaker B: And the regulators are taking an active decision to say digital assets are not here to stay. We can kill it in the cradle and not let it grow. Well, it's going to happen. And it's going to happen regardless of whether or not the United States is a leader or a follower. And if we're a leader, it can have a rule of law speech rights embedded in it like we had with web One, we can now have with web Three. So it's my duty and the help that I need from you to make sure we move policy in Washington so that we can have this technology happen here and you don't have to make tough choices for your companies on where you're going to be headquartered in employee headcount, where you seek to be regulated and where you seek to innovate. We want it here in the United States and we want you to be the key folks that draw in talent globally and use cases globally that we can then export.
00:09:11.450 - 00:09:56.060, Speaker B: So we've got a lot of pressure in the short term because the regulator is in the wrong space. The world is catching up and innovators want to innovate and put dollars and ideas at risk and in the marketplace. So that's the push for me as a policymaker. And the reason why I'm here is you need to understand the implications for you of the uncertainty of these regulators. And you need to know that you have a role in how you can advocate for this new technology and you have a voice in this process. Because we have an open society, we have elections, and we have elected officials that need to listen to their constituents. So you need to connect with them.
00:09:56.060 - 00:10:41.482, Speaker B: And that's my ask today, which is give me feedback. I'd love to hear your questions. We've got plenty of time for that, number one. Number two, know that you do have a say and a power in this debate, both in the short term and in the long term. And three, with the mechanisms that Colin has talked about in Washington, you have a way to do this effectively and at the same time still focus on your primary job of innovating and delivering. So thank you for your time. Why don't we stop there's? All right.
00:10:41.482 - 00:11:02.080, Speaker B: You have no slide deck from me. You're welcome. What's on your mind? Tell me. If you ask a question, I hope you will your name, what you're doing and then your question. Come on. You got to practice this stuff anyway, right?
00:11:03.490 - 00:11:23.190, Speaker C: Hey, my name is Ellie. I am building bello. We're an analytics platform for creators in Web three, you talked about Ethereum Bitcoin being securities or not being securities. Rather, could you provide more clarity into cryptocurrencies that exist today that would be considered a security or if you've seen them and sort of where does that line get drawn?
00:11:26.010 - 00:12:15.190, Speaker B: So it's not my interest. To answer your question, you heard what I'm arguing against and a guy who's unwilling to say what is a commodity because he's the head of the Sures Exchange Commission, I'm not giving you firepower to get in an argument with him. But what I will say is this. If you meet the four prongs of Howie and Reeves, you're firmly a security. And if you're pretending that you can fake your way into out of the securities regime, you can't do it. You can't. So when you go through the measurement of this and you think, well, this is firmly a small group of us that will control this network, sorry, you're not going to be proven out.
00:12:15.190 - 00:12:42.910, Speaker B: That is not a decentralized anything. And the idea that you can still have some significant control over this means that you're actually in control of mean that to me is the key. Prove out. If it's a narrow group of folks that still have broad impact on the whole network, you're not decentralized. You're a pretender to it. You're kind of like Sam Bankman fried using QuickBooks and pretending like he's an innovator.
00:12:44.370 - 00:13:05.046, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. And I guess I'm curious. With the legislation that's being passed, the goal is to provide more clarity. A lot of us working this like that's what we want. We're not against following rules. We just want to know what the rules are. And I think part of that will potentially be sussing out bad actors like the Sam Bankman, Frieds or whoever else, I guess.
00:13:05.046 - 00:13:11.914, Speaker C: Where do you see the effect on the industry, both positively and negatively as these bills come out?
00:13:12.112 - 00:13:50.200, Speaker B: Well, it'll be a shakeout because you'll either clearly be a decentralized something or you won't. And so you have a lot of folks that have his point. There are 10,000 coins, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, a majority of those are not a majority. There are a substantial number of those that are bad actors with malicious intent, and they're trying to defraud people. That's not the whole industry. This is the reason why this is so important, because it's a prove out that you're real, that you're of substance, and you're real.
00:13:50.200 - 00:14:12.186, Speaker B: But once we have regulatory clarity, you're going to have a shakeout, and you will have a shakeout based off of the final application of our law. And that will be long term good, short term painful, because it will provide stark clarity. You either are or you're not.
00:14:12.288 - 00:14:13.934, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you.
00:14:13.972 - 00:14:15.120, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you.
00:14:16.130 - 00:14:40.120, Speaker D: Hello. Thank you for being here today. My name is Will Mctai, and I am building a product and marketing analytics tool for DeFi. So my question is, why do you think the SEC is really so hostile towards crypto right now? Is it because of the SBF news and the reported relationship with the Dems or something like that?
00:14:41.050 - 00:14:48.438, Speaker B: There are a couple things. First of all, Senator Elizabeth Warren has a very fixed view on crypto.
00:14:48.534 - 00:14:49.660, Speaker D: Do you know why.
00:14:51.470 - 00:16:24.438, Speaker B: It'S so confusing to me? Her career was focused on pushing back on the big bank's control of the financial system of banking, and then she pivoted to hating crypto, which is this is the answer to your problem, right? Clearly. But she has a very fixed view on this and does not see the potential. The underlying current here is an anti tech bias, an anti innovation bias, and it goes right back to when folks came from the countryside to break the looms that were taking people's jobs. It's an anti technology view that it's at the heart of that. Now, that's not where all the progressive left members of the House and Senate are. There are, in fact, some that completely get the use case, completely see the potential and how it links up with their worldview, which the beautiful thing here is, whatever your worldview is, you can see it through being able to control your financial future and the way you interact with the Internet and unleashing value in the world of information. The bias here, though, is driven by some loud voices in the progressive left.
00:16:24.438 - 00:16:43.870, Speaker B: And Senator Warren has a very strong chokehold on nominations to financial regulators. And Gary Gensler listens to her more than any other senator and is much more doing her handiwork at the agency rather than having an independent agenda.
00:16:45.010 - 00:16:46.234, Speaker D: Thank you. That's very helpful.
00:16:46.282 - 00:17:09.350, Speaker B: Thanks. The second part is they should find themselves quite embarrassed by their relationship with Sam Bank, Mcfried and FTX and were doing they were set up to do some of his bidding, and that because of his deep connectivity with some democratic elected officials. And that has then embarrassed them into this position further.
00:17:09.930 - 00:17:15.714, Speaker D: And you mentioned at the end that we can advocate. How can we advocate?
00:17:15.762 - 00:17:16.870, Speaker B: So where are you from?
00:17:17.020 - 00:17:18.410, Speaker D: I'm from the UK.
00:17:18.830 - 00:17:20.490, Speaker B: Not helpful to this conversation.
00:17:21.710 - 00:17:23.610, Speaker D: But I live in California.
00:17:26.190 - 00:17:34.446, Speaker B: You have two members of the Senate, one member of the House. You need to have connectivity with them. The issue here is that I'll ask.
00:17:34.468 - 00:17:36.126, Speaker D: My girlfriend to vote yes.
00:17:36.228 - 00:17:37.278, Speaker B: Where is she from?
00:17:37.364 - 00:17:43.954, Speaker D: America. But more specifically, we live in San Francisco. But she is from New York.
00:17:44.072 - 00:17:52.450, Speaker B: Okay, give it's an Internet.
00:17:53.110 - 00:17:54.850, Speaker D: Do you need us to move somewhere?
00:17:56.250 - 00:18:08.230, Speaker B: No, my point is where you're from? That's where you're from. So who's from? Give me a state that's neither Great Britain. Anybody not from California?
00:18:08.310 - 00:18:09.030, Speaker E: Arizona.
00:18:09.110 - 00:18:10.134, Speaker B: Minnesota. Whereabout?
00:18:10.182 - 00:18:10.902, Speaker E: Arizona.
00:18:10.966 - 00:18:24.714, Speaker B: Arizona. That's different than Minnesota. You said Minnesota. Minneapolis. Who's that? Yes. Reach out to her. Connect with okay, so and where are you from?
00:18:24.832 - 00:18:25.718, Speaker E: Arizona.
00:18:25.814 - 00:18:26.742, Speaker B: Yes. Where?
00:18:26.896 - 00:18:27.690, Speaker E: Scottsdale.
00:18:27.770 - 00:18:43.966, Speaker B: Scottsdale. All right. I think Dave Schweiker is your congressman, I think connection there. Right. So go back to those connectivities and have a relationship with them. You have expertise. You can bring expertise to policymakers.
00:18:43.966 - 00:19:03.046, Speaker B: They're either interested or not interested in hearing from experts. And if they're not interested, you can replace them. And if they are, you can engage with them. Engage with them. So that outreach, that connectivity. Regardless of where you're from, but where you are, make sure you have those connectivities with your members of the House and Senate.
00:19:03.238 - 00:19:03.930, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:19:04.000 - 00:19:04.620, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:19:06.190 - 00:19:28.770, Speaker E: Thank you, Chairman. My name is Murat. I'm the founder of Primev. We're building very low level infra that makes blockchains operate more efficiently, essentially. I want to highlight two problems as an entrepreneur in the space that I continuously have. This is my second startup in the space, my third business overall. And I want to kind of see how you're addressing it, maybe in your legislation or how you're thinking about it.
00:19:28.770 - 00:20:15.306, Speaker E: One is with stablecoins in terms of the fiat on and off ramp. So basically getting on chain and off chain in terms of even US dollars. The fact that there's such a huge wall between that and when we think about isn't there aren't that many walls between banks. It's just dollars moving. When you send it from a bank's to PayPal's ledger or venmo, something like that, it's fairly seamless, but for some reason, the minute it goes on chain and yes, there's some reasons for it, it gets incredibly difficult. And there's a huge kind of wall in between and that creates these kind of isolated environments where prices and other things, there's lots of more derivatives on the other side because of this, and prices move. It essentially adds risk and uncertainty to the system on the one side, because that process is not efficient.
00:20:15.306 - 00:21:02.938, Speaker E: And yes, we can have KYC and other things in between, but making that process more efficient or at least more seamless would lead to a lot of stability on the other side that would help all of us over here and people creating businesses. So one is that concept and the other is just banking as just someone paying their vendors. We're not buying crypto or betting on anything, but just as a crypto company that has multiple bank accounts, multiple institutions at this point is just incredibly difficult. This morning I had to pay a vendor who accepts money in stablecoins and I had to really think, oh, should I really do this from our JP morgan account? Because they might flag us for some reason, and I'd rather not do that or deal with that. So having that level of anxiety is also a huge problem. So I just wanted to ask your opinion, how you're thinking about these two problems in the legislature.
00:21:02.954 - 00:21:54.130, Speaker B: Let's start with that. So Operation Choke .2.0 is real. You have banks that are unwilling to create new business lines even though they see that there's a need because of regulators. And the regulators are saying not no, they're saying, I'm going to have a lot of questions and you're going to have a lot of work to do on an ongoing basis about all your relationships, which means it's an added expense to start a new business line and an added expense you can't appropriately measure. So that's the reason why you see banks not opening up new relationships. One, two, you have existing banks that are dealing with those same regulatory pressures, but they have existing relationships they're willing to keep, and they're trying to keep, but they have pressures from their regulators on asking about every transaction.
00:21:54.130 - 00:22:47.220, Speaker B: So until Congress acts, you're going to see this type of action. And they're trying to choke off the industry. And they have this view that they can still choke off the digital assets industry and everybody innovating in this space, which I think is absurd, completely absurd. It is counter to history and it's counter to technology deployment. But that's where this administration is and these regulators, we're trying to remedy that by acting and acting in a bipartisan way in Congress and changing the law so they can't do that and bringing clarity to the space generally. That's one, two, our existing stablecoin regime is clunky. There's not real competition in the space.
00:22:47.220 - 00:23:45.246, Speaker B: And so we need to enhance this by having a federal option for a regulatory pathway. And we need to have this option firmly in a payments regime. And firmly in a payments regime takes it out of, in essence, a current financial product sitting alongside a current financial product. So this is effectively a paired trade, if you think, in a securities regime or commodities regime. And by doing it that way, it makes it clunkier, much more friction in that if we put it into the payments regime, they can smooth out some of these subjects and clarify the regulation to make it less clunky. But then we need a bunch of technologists in there to actually make it much more seamless and less clunky. And the only way to do that is to draw in more capital, more talent, more opportunity than we currently have, which means we need clarity.
00:23:45.246 - 00:23:48.434, Speaker B: We get clarity. Then the stuff will go, I think.
00:23:48.552 - 00:23:52.310, Speaker E: Yeah, we'll make those parts happen. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your input.
00:23:52.730 - 00:24:41.186, Speaker B: Thank you, Chairman, for being here. My name is Jay. We are building ETH ID. We're trying to make Web Three so easy, your mom can use it. So my question is for all my colleagues of innovators in this room, are there particular lines of messaging that your colleagues have found persuasive when talking about this topic? I'm from Miami, Florida, and reach out to my Congresspeople that are representatives. But I'm curious if there are different, what kind of messaging would be most effective? Well, first, it's here to stay, right? Digital assets are here to stay. You have tens of thousands of people working in this space globally, and most of those are now overseas because they have regulatory clarity.
00:24:41.186 - 00:25:11.470, Speaker B: Europe has regulatory clarity before the United States does. That's a major message here to stay. A lot of people, a lot of investment dollars, and now it's disproportionately overseas because the US. Doesn't have a regulatory regime. The Europeans are ahead of us. I think those are key message points to deliver to policymakers. And what you want is effective, clear law so you can innovate and consumers can be protected.
00:25:11.470 - 00:25:40.810, Speaker B: I think that's the full message. The final thing is policymakers, young and old. I think generally in society, we want to be thought of as knowing technology and not being cromagnets. Right. We want to think of ourselves as advanced and using our frontal lobe. Right. And when you hear people that are anti technology, you then question their worldview.
00:25:40.810 - 00:26:10.194, Speaker B: People don't want to be considered as out of this century, like, not up to date, especially those that are not up to date and not of this century. So don't forget that as the backdrop of a lot of people's thinking that are anti crypto, they just don't like technology or not willing to invest a little time to understand it. I see. So jobs, investment, and staying up to date. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you.
00:26:10.392 - 00:26:36.300, Speaker F: Thank you so much. We've been learning a lot and really appreciate what you're doing for the whole space. It's extremely important. Nikita. I'm with chain patrol. We stop phishing attacks and scams from stealing users'funds in the crypto space. My question for, you know, with something like Bitcoin, there's the possibility where if the adoption keeps increasing, it might become the dominant currency in the world in general.
00:26:36.300 - 00:27:10.520, Speaker F: Let's say that scenario happens. I don't know if with other policymakers and people on your team, have you modeled such a potential scenario and how does that affect right now, the government can roughly work with things like inflation and other things like they control the supply of money. Has there been any kind of experiments around what does the future look like if that isn't controlled by the central banks or something else like that?
00:27:12.330 - 00:27:41.870, Speaker B: We haven't fully modeled that out, no. And central banks are unwilling to model that out. Right. Because it's beyond their capacity to think about it, frankly. But stepping back, there's this global move to get away from dollars. China has an interest there. Russia certainly has an interest there since their invasion in Ukraine.
00:27:41.870 - 00:28:12.730, Speaker B: And so they're trying to push the world. We have a lot of different people around the globe. A lot of nation states are trying to de dollarize. That's been a movement that pops up from time to time. But our rapid rise in rates is one is a motivator. Our sanctions regime is another motivator. And both those things have been heightened in the last year because of real action.
00:28:12.730 - 00:28:44.862, Speaker B: They're trying to look for some viable other alternative. There is no other viable alternative. We have the largest debt in the world, and we have the most global exchange of goods and services of any other country in the world. It's very difficult to avoid the US. Dollar. If we get a regulatory regime up to par and is competitive, we can draw people here into the United States to deploy this asset class, which then becomes an alternative to alternatives around the world. That's the US.
00:28:44.862 - 00:29:12.110, Speaker B: Dollar in the short run over the next 2030 years. I don't see the world going primarily off the US. Dollar. We might be a lower percentage of the mix. There's a lot of debate about that. But if we engage in global commerce and we still have the largest debt in the world, which we're likely to have over the next 2030 years, it's going to be difficult to avoid the US. Dollar.
00:29:12.110 - 00:29:49.274, Speaker B: There's no other safe place to do it. The alternative, though, that people are seeking may find itself that alternative may be one of these l ones. And Bitcoin seems to be the most viable option currently. And early adoption gives them a huge advance, gives the asset this huge advanced reach. So maybe, perhaps Bitcoin is the alternative that people are looking for alternatives. The folks that are look, this is a terrible explanation. Sorry.
00:29:49.274 - 00:30:29.714, Speaker B: Those that are seeking alternatives may find that in Bitcoin over the next 2030 years, they're unlikely to de dollarize fully in any respect. So I think this might actually be helpful for the US. And for dollar diplomacy to have another viable rule of law centered, speech rights centered, fully distributed asset that we all can verify, like Bitcoin. So that's how I think it shakes out, not as this being the dominant reserve currency globally.
00:30:29.842 - 00:30:33.222, Speaker F: Yeah, thank you. That's not an easy question, but I really appreciate your answer.
00:30:33.276 - 00:30:36.600, Speaker B: Thanks for letting me walk through that in front of everybody.
00:30:38.350 - 00:31:17.670, Speaker G: Thanks so much. Chairman I'm Nitya building capsule infrastructure to make it easier and safer to sign transactions on chain. Wanted to ask about kind of the reverse side of, as you mentioned, kind of going back and forth, and there's been obviously changes even year to year. And in terms of prognosis, what can the space do in terms of use cases around crypto, like case studies kind of combating the headlines that we've kind of saw late last year. And are there any kind of examples of that you see that would make your job easier?
00:31:18.890 - 00:31:46.222, Speaker B: So this is not a new asset class. It's not. It unlocks enormous potential that's locked up in uneconomic ways. So for us to get out of this as a financial product, I mean, I've got to do my work in the Financial Services Committee, but when you're saying, well, it's a new asset class, they're like, well, just put it in one of the two regimes. It's commodities security. Come on, get out of the way. Right? Well, it's an investment of money.
00:31:46.222 - 00:32:44.820, Speaker B: Okay, well, we know how to do that. That's a securities regime. This is a new thing based off of a new technology frame that unlocks a variety of use cases. The lack of effective, viable use cases at this stage of the game is a huge inhibitor for us to get more policymakers to say, yeah, I got to get on board with this. But in fairness, when we passed the Telecom Act of 1996, if I said, well, you know, the results of this is, in about ten years you have a little box and you're going to and a car is going to show up and take you somewhere and they're going to say, what kind of drugs are you on to me? Right. So the use cases at the early generation of the Internet weren't fully baked. Nobody knew how to make money in that first iteration when Congress is writing policy.
00:32:44.820 - 00:33:20.090, Speaker B: But to explain use cases and actually your use case is a very reasonable one that people can understand. That really helps policymakers grapple with this. And I'm trying to explain our policy details in that context. It could lead to this, it could lead to that. It could lead to the other outside of financial transactions that moves policymakers, I think, more than just a financial transaction vehicle.
00:33:21.410 - 00:33:22.446, Speaker G: Thank you so much.
00:33:22.548 - 00:33:23.200, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:33:23.730 - 00:33:55.480, Speaker H: Hey, thank you for. Your talk david from Discover here I'm building in the social space, trying to give users more choice over what they see through open algorithms. I'm curious how you see the future and when you expect the industry might see more clarity from a regulation point of view, maybe like a percentage chance that you think the SEC will publicly state that ether is a commodity in the next two years.
00:33:57.710 - 00:35:05.934, Speaker B: Congress will do it because the SEC won't. Okay, my calendar for action is we'll have a bill passed out of House committees by the 4 July and by the fall, we'll have a bill passed out of the House of Representatives that is a market structure bill, a definition of a digital asset and a payment stablecoin passed out of the House of Representatives by the end of the year. I give it a 45% chance of success that we have law that I'm able to pass a market structure bill and a stablecoin bill into law. 45% chance in my view, is a really good chance because it's very difficult to legislate in Congress, it's very difficult to get anything done. So I am optimistic. The ODS have been far stacked, been far worse stacked against me for other policies I've carried through into law. This is the most important though, to me.
00:35:05.934 - 00:35:28.310, Speaker B: So I want to get things done and I've got Democrats and Republicans that are working with me to get things done. Thank you, thank you. And when we do that, that will provide the clarity for all digital assets in their regulatory regime, not the obvious one, that ETH is a commodity. Ether is a commodity.
00:35:29.450 - 00:35:52.246, Speaker C: Hi Chairman, thanks very much for being here today. So I'm nico, we are building fully on chain games. Just a follow up question for the ether, whether commodity or security, as you mentioned, that if it's a commodity, it will be under the Agriculture Committee. So is that a promising path that if it's categorized as commodity, how are they thinking of it?
00:35:52.368 - 00:36:39.770, Speaker B: So this is the quirky bit so this is the quirky bit of our regulators, our financial regulators are a complete mess in the United States, right? You go to every other regime around the world, you go to one financial regulator and they do everything. They do banking, they do securities, they do commodities, they maybe sell fruits and vegetables in the back. I mean it's like they do everything, right? And you come to the United States and you're wait, wait, we have three different bank regulators, nothing bad could happen with that. We have securities and commodities and they don't talk to each other. And then you have commodities that are regulated by the Agriculture Committee that's focused on farm products. And commodities are much different things now than 100 years ago. So that's complicated.
00:36:39.770 - 00:37:14.360, Speaker B: The commodities regime is purpose built for clear products that are not run by an ongoing concern and don't need ongoing disclosures on the decisions that a narrow few are making. So when you think of Bitcoin, it's clearly a commodity. The reason why the regulators have not gone after Bitcoin is go knock on whose door. Right. Go find Satoshi. Go ahead. Right.
00:37:14.360 - 00:38:23.818, Speaker B: A lot of theories about who's Satoshi, but there's no door to knock on. So they have to acknowledge that it is what it is, a commodity. And likewise, if there is no one maintaining that, no central person maintaining the network on an ongoing basis and is in control of that network, it is clearly not a security. So we need to prove that out and get them into the right kind of regime, which is appropriate and purpose built for the type of regulations that will enable innovation to occur. Okay, so I do think it's the right regime for the things that are most clearly commodities. But we have a lot of folks in the space that will fall into the securities regime because they're still controlled by a narrow few and predominantly owned by a narrow few and don't actually have a proven ongoing concern of a fully functional network. And absent those qualities, they're going to fall into the security regime.
00:38:23.818 - 00:38:43.678, Speaker B: So there's going to be clarity here. And until you free yourself and actually have a network that does not need to be maintained by a narrow few on a day to day basis and be controlled by that narrow, you've got you've got a heavier regulatory burden. Yep.
00:38:43.774 - 00:38:44.562, Speaker C: Thank you very much.
00:38:44.616 - 00:38:44.978, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:38:45.064 - 00:39:18.480, Speaker I: Hi, Chairman. Thanks so much for being here today. I'm Brandon, working on a protocol called Share. I think a lot of the for me at least, the distinction between commodities versus security seems to stem from the language in the original paper around coins and tokens. But from a technical perspective, these are really just pieces of data on the Internet that happen to be used as coins and tokens. Have there been thoughts around the case where maybe it's neither a commodity or a security, but instead a credibly neutral infrastructure layer that actually combats the biggest problems that are happening today with monopolies and big tech?
00:39:21.310 - 00:39:32.142, Speaker B: Well, if your key has a value, if your keys have value, that's a very difficult thing.
00:39:32.276 - 00:39:38.634, Speaker I: Perceived value, though, right? My laptop has value to someone that's in the market for it, but it's not a security or commodity.
00:39:38.682 - 00:39:51.566, Speaker B: So let me step back, Colin. Colin, we'll step back. My was that we should have a third regulator for this space that is different from that. Go ahead, Colin.
00:39:51.758 - 00:39:53.560, Speaker A: I wish you hadn't asked this question.
00:39:54.090 - 00:40:21.486, Speaker B: So you got to go poke the bear here, but I've got to acknowledge political reality, and I got to go put it with the agency that most fits. There is certainly space here for things that are neither securities nor commodities, and there is certainly space here by which I can own things and put them in my pocket. And it's none of your business what's in my pocket exactly. And we have to preserve that. We have to preserve that. Right. It's none of my business.
00:40:21.486 - 00:40:54.074, Speaker B: I don't know if you have no dollars in your pocket or whatever. Doesn't matter. It's none of my business. I had to have this discussion when we're negotiating last summer with government officials about wallets. I said, well, we need wallet regulation just like we have banking regulation. Right? You have a bank account for safety purposes. I'm like, well, what is a wallet exactly? No, what is a wallet? I don't understand what a wallet is because my wallet could be a notes app.
00:40:54.074 - 00:41:16.400, Speaker B: It could be a piece of paper in my pocket. Right. It could just be in my head. Right. But they don't conceive of that. And so you have to win fundamental fights for spaces for freedom in the middle of this regulatory frame. And you're raising a really valid question that we have to make sure is provisioned for in law.
00:41:16.400 - 00:41:48.134, Speaker B: Because there are things that are by which I may want to give you and you may want to give to me without an exchange of value. So much as I want to give it to you, you want to give it to me. We have to have provision for that. Right. You can take shoes, right? We can sell shoes right now, what's the reporting mechanism to the government? There is no provision for that. Right. So we have to have the same provision on the Internet.
00:41:48.134 - 00:42:09.314, Speaker B: We have to have the same provision in digital assets. We have to have the same provision whether it's me giving you $5 on PayPal to pay for a coffee. Right. There's stuff that should not be the government's concern here and it doesn't go to some larger societal problem and we have to make sure it's provisioning law.
00:42:09.512 - 00:42:10.418, Speaker I: Thank you so much.
00:42:10.504 - 00:42:17.140, Speaker B: That was a setup, colin and I'm glad we ended with that because you can give him a hard time.
00:42:17.750 - 00:42:19.402, Speaker A: We'll talk about this offline.
00:42:19.566 - 00:42:20.182, Speaker I: Sounds good.
00:42:20.236 - 00:42:20.406, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:20.428 - 00:42:23.254, Speaker I: It sounds like it might be an issue with the naming convention, but thank you.
00:42:23.292 - 00:42:40.700, Speaker B: Yeah. So we need a better name for Stablecoins, by the way. Nitbits. Thank you. Thank you for what you're doing. Thanks for what you're doing. Now that I get to use later.
00:42:40.700 - 00:42:58.990, Speaker B: It's great to be with you all and see the people that are making a huge difference. I'm going to go back and go to the salt mines and try to carve away whatever space I can. So you can go innovate. But thanks for what you all are doing and honored to have a moment with you. Thanks so much. God bless.
