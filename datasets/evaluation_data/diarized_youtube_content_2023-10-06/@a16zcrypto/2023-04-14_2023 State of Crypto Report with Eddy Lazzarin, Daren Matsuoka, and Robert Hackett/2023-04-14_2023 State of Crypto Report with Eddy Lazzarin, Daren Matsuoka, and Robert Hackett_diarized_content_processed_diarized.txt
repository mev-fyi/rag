00:00:00.650 - 00:00:24.254, Speaker A: All right. Hi, everybody. Thanks for joining and welcome to the A 16 Z Crypto Livestream. I'm Robert Hackett, an editorial partner here at A 16 Z Crypto. And today we're going to be doing a deep dive into our latest State of Crypto report, which published this morning. This is our second such report, and it's chock full of data, highlights and takeaways about everything that's been going on in Web Three. We're going to start that deep dive in just a moment.
00:00:24.254 - 00:00:51.866, Speaker A: After that presentation, we'll also be showing off a new interactive tool we just launched, the State of Crypto Index. Now, this index combines a bunch of public data sources from across the industry. It blends them together and it spits out a picture of the industry's health. It's really cool. Go play with it if you haven't already. Now, I know many of you are super curious about the findings in the report, about all the nitty gritty nuances in the methodology, how the index works, what it means. So let's get into it.

00:01:24.440 - 00:02:02.500, Speaker A: We'll be airing an episode separate and different from this live stream about the report and the index there. Soon you can catch us having a conversation. We'll be joined by Chris Dixon there, who's the founder and lead partner of A 16 Z Crypto, so you can hear his thoughts there. Okay, let's get on with it. Say hello to my hosts, give them a wave, a GM, whatever you like. I'm here with Darren Motswoka, our lead data scientist and spearheader of this report and index. And we've also got Eddie Lazarin, the chief technology officer at A 16 Z Crypto, both of whom spent many, many hours putting this package together for you.
00:02:02.500 - 00:02:04.062, Speaker A: All right, gentlemen.
00:02:04.126 - 00:02:04.654, Speaker B: Thanks, Robert.
00:02:04.702 - 00:02:07.240, Speaker A: Djens. Anans. Take it away, you guys.
00:02:08.250 - 00:02:49.154, Speaker B: Sure. So, yeah, I'm Eddie Lazarin and I'm going to take us away on the report for now. So first, just a general overview. Where's crypto today? A lot has happened over the last year. There's been some significant progress and some significant setbacks. And like it is every year, crypto is volatile and fascinating, and the technology continues to evolve in new and exciting ways. There's challenges ahead, like on the regulatory front, something that we've been investing a lot of time and attention into, but we're very hopeful about, particularly in the US.
00:02:49.154 - 00:03:26.830, Speaker B: And most importantly, of all, there's incredible opportunity and the last couple of years have made that even clearer than before. Our overall view of crypto and that's important to situate all the things that we present in the report. Our overall view on crypto is that it's more than a financial movement. Crypto creates a new kind of computer and it's an evolution of the Internet. We'll say a little bit more about that. Blockchains are more than ledgers. Their full programmability means that more sophisticated and complex things can be expressed in an environment where computation can be verified.
00:03:26.830 - 00:04:16.830, Speaker B: And this has some very interesting consequences. So why does web3 matter? There have been three kinds of networks that have unfolded over the history of the Internet in different phases. And these three phases are very distinct in terms of their technical and economic properties, particularly ownership control, privacy, verification of compute. These properties radically change how those networks can be used. So these properties have immediate economic consequences. This changes take rates, it changes the ability of users to exit and avoid rent collecting. It affects what kinds of businesses can be built on different types of networks.
00:04:16.830 - 00:04:26.690, Speaker B: It changes the ability to remix and recombine them and the composability of these systems. So the network design has economic consequences.
00:04:27.030 - 00:04:40.518, Speaker A: Eddie, I think this is an important point because a lot of people, they hear that Web Three has low take rates but they kind of think that maybe as soon as a platform gets big enough they'll just jack up the rents. Maybe you could just touch on.
00:04:40.684 - 00:05:31.634, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the great thing to assume. What's really interesting is that examine why it's possible for a system to start to take higher take rates as it accumulates a network effect like consider one of the social media networks or consider one of the application platforms. What are the fundamental reasons why they can increase their take rate or avoid including the users of the system in the economics at all? It's because they can constrain people's ability to exit the valuable things. It's because they can constrain access to the underlying code. There's all kinds of ways that they can create extreme defensibility of their market position. But the way that Web Three works is you can guarantee the ability of users to exit with a valuable thing. You can guarantee interoperability.
00:05:31.634 - 00:05:59.600, Speaker B: You can design a system that remains unified but also open and can be something that people can build on taking for granted that it can't be evil because of the power of decentralized. Consensus. So that network design has economic consequences for the people who are building on it, for the users who use it and so on and so forth. And we're seeing how the early experiments in these new network designs are playing out.
00:06:01.250 - 00:06:10.050, Speaker A: It's a really good point and as Christian likes to say, quoting the Google motto, they say don't be evil, but in Web Three it can't be evil.
00:06:11.030 - 00:06:55.630, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. And that's because of consensus, because of network design. Exactly. So one of the consequences of a network design, as we've seen and we just discussed, can be the extreme consolidation of network power like in Web Two, or the inability to fund development or other critical features like in Web One. Crypto offers a third way to design networks that can resolve these issues and we're in the earliest days of understanding how those networks can be used. But it is a genuinely new path along many important dimensions. And although crypto can provide solutions and we're seeing examples of that, it can also create a casino.
00:06:55.630 - 00:07:15.270, Speaker B: And that's because creating a casino only requires the free transmissibility of assets, which is one of the simplest things that a crypto network can provide, among many other possible things. So with that, I'll hand it to Darren for this next section.
00:07:16.010 - 00:08:09.702, Speaker C: Thank you, Eddie. As kind of Eddie was just talking about with the crypto casino versus the crypto computer, we really like to focus on the technological progress in crypto. But the reality is that the market has both what we call financial cycles as well as product cycles and in crypto we think these things actually reinforce each other and the end result is consistent long term growth in the space. This isn't a new concept, it's actually something that our firm has spent a lot of time thinking about and writing about in the past. We call it the price innovation cycle. And the bottom line of the analysis is really that we believe there's a feedback loop between prices and innovation in crypto. And in fact, we think that prices are often a leading indicator of that technological progress.
00:08:09.702 - 00:09:21.978, Speaker C: And the reason for that is that prices kind of naturally lead to more interest in the space. That interest leads to new ideas. Those new ideas become startups and projects and those startups and projects build great stuff that contributes to the development of the industry and then ultimately an increase in the prices that we see. And this might make sense in theory, but we can also really support this by looking at some of the data in more granular views of the industry metrics. On this slide you can see the global crypto market cap compared to social media activity as measured by Twitter, mentions developer activity as measured by GitHub stars and funding activity as measured by funding rounds from PitchBook. You'll note that the x axis here is all the same, showing the growth since 2011. And it's maybe a bit hard to see in this particular view, but if you look closely at the data, you'll actually see that the developer activity, the startup activity, the social media activity, that all happens and really becomes more active in the months shortly after the big price swings.
00:09:21.978 - 00:10:11.054, Speaker C: And I think that speaks to this price innovation cycle that we're talking about. It's happened consistently across the four major cycles that we've seen in crypto since Bitcoin's inception, and again, just really speaks to that feedback loop that we've mentioned. And then the result, of course, is that consistent long term growth as measured by the very kind of positive Kegrs. We also wanted to really double down on the distinction between financial cycles and product cycles. Throughout history, great products have been built in all financial market cycles. You can see a consistent founding of the most important companies in tech each and every year. Look at companies like Facebook and YouTube that were founded in the years shortly after the.com
00:10:11.054 - 00:10:43.882, Speaker C: crash, as well as companies like Uber, WhatsApp and Bitcoin that were born during the global financial crisis. Remember, financial cycles are highly volatile, very hard to predict, but product cycles are much more consistent in terms of what that means for where the crypto industry is today. Of course, the prices have fallen, but great products have launched as builders continue to build. And with that, maybe I'll pass it back to Eddie to talk about some of this development that we've seen and some trends to watch in the space.
00:10:44.016 - 00:10:44.554, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:44.672 - 00:12:27.466, Speaker B: So if there are product cycles and financial cycles, two different forces at play that relate to each other in some way, but ultimately unfold independently, then what are the key things that we can track to watch the development of products over time? Although prices are the most spectacular thing, there's actually much better indicators, specific things that we can look at underneath the hood that show us how technological progress is compounding. So this section, we're going to go over some interesting things. You can see almost all these are public data and things that you can find for yourself but we've put together for you. So first, there are maybe one of the most important grand themes to me, and I can say a little bit more as to why is that blockchains are really going down the path of scaling and exploring many different new avenues. We have new layer ones that have different fundamental architectures that try to scale radically through choosing different parts of the trade off space and adopting new technologies and new research. We have convergent evolution in terms of what some might call application specific chains, some would call execution shards. It's interesting to see the nomenclature in the space evolve, but I'll say in this top right corner category, zksync, Cosmos, Optimism, Polygon, Polkadot and others have all adopted a sort of very high level similar approach where applications or groups of applications group together and perform computations together and then settle that shared state somewhere else.
00:12:27.466 - 00:13:01.830, Speaker B: And of course, they have very different choices. But this model is playing out and looking very, very promising. Within that category, we have optimistic roll ups, zero knowledge roll ups, which are two different, very different approaches to scaling that we'll show in the next slide, actually have achieved significant adoption over the last year. And we have some fascinating developments in data availability, which is a core premise, core component of the way that blockchains guarantee different properties of that data and its availability.
00:13:02.330 - 00:13:07.080, Speaker A: Eddie, maybe you could zoom out for just a second and say why scaling is important at all.
00:13:08.170 - 00:14:11.966, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. This could be debated and I'm happy to be wrong in it's a really interesting topic to me, but my firm belief maybe you could do an analog with the early stages of the Internet, like dial up and broadband, right? If you told someone that what you were going to get out of broadband was loading a specific website faster, that probably be nice. But that wouldn't really be that exciting or profound because the kinds of things that you'd anticipate are kind of buried. They're a little opaque when you frame the question that way. But if instead you say, well, if everybody gets broadband and fast internet, we can have YouTubers and Twitch Streamers and MMOs and all these new types of applications, all the things that we've seen on the internet today, then it becomes a little bit more clear how scaling one key dimension or several key dimensions in compute many of those have scaled over the last two decades can allow for experimentation and innovation. New types of applications. Blockchains are no different.
00:14:11.966 - 00:15:07.578, Speaker B: Just sending a token or transferring an asset is a relatively simple computational task. But being able to do it in a huge way where you're reaching a massive number of people or more subtly if you're mutating and doing complex things underneath the hood that can require significant scalability. And my genuine belief is that if we radically scale the throughput of blockchains and improve the user experience and a variety of other things that all relate to the technologies maturing, then we'll create the opportunities for waste and experimentation that people need in order to be able to discover what the native new applications are. And we're starting to get the signs of that since blockchains are just starting to be able to scale. So thanks for that, Robert. I alluded to this slide. This is a really cool one, one of mine, Darren's favorites.
00:15:07.578 - 00:15:31.762, Speaker B: We talk about this one a lot. We've been tracking it for some time. This is the percentage of block space that is being consumed on L One by all the L two S. So of course L One on Ethereum. Ethereum has a specific gas budget. That's the amount of compute you can think of it or storage. It's kind of a mixture of a few things but it's the amount that can happen per block.
00:15:31.762 - 00:16:00.894, Speaker B: And this is the percentage on average of those blocks that are consumed by what's happening on L two S. This is going way up. There was a recent pop. You can see promise we didn't time. We've been working on the report for months so couldn't have anticipated this. But you can see Zksync era recently launched, which has radically increased this measure. This shows that more and more activity is happening on L2 S.
00:16:00.894 - 00:16:13.410, Speaker B: And L2 S are finding it worthwhile to continue to park more and more of that data on L One. This is about as concrete evidence as you can have that L2 S are starting to scale.
00:16:14.630 - 00:16:37.322, Speaker C: And by the way, we shared this same exact chart last year in the 2022 State of Crypto report, and the current percentage of Ethereum fees paid by L2 roll ups was 1.5%. So it's since more than quadrupled. And this is actually a number that we think can go even higher. And so it'll be interesting to see what this number looks like in next year's report.
00:16:37.456 - 00:17:01.330, Speaker A: It's a shock. Exactly right. And even in the past year, it's pretty amazing. We actually have a question from the audience, too, related to L2 S. Sure. Estefano Andres on Twitter, he said L2 blockchains have seen significant growth in terms of fees on Ethereum. How do you foresee L2 solutions evolving in the next few years? And what potential challenges could they face in terms of widespread adoption?
00:17:03.510 - 00:17:30.506, Speaker B: That's a great question. In terms of obvious developments. I mean, the first one, I think, is on the top of everybody's mind, on the tip of everyone's tongue is Protodank Sharding EIP 40 at 44, which could, as a result of creating a separate little pocket of data specifically used for roll ups and things like that, could radically decrease transaction fees even further. It's a really nice economical use of space.
00:17:30.688 - 00:17:32.794, Speaker A: And this is a proposed Ethereum software.
00:17:32.842 - 00:18:10.394, Speaker B: Upgrade just for yeah, exactly right. I think that could make a huge difference. But maybe more importantly is going to be the story of interoperability. If we have a bunch of L2 S and interconnecting L2 S, the story of how they interconnect and the types of things that they share, like their shared state, their shared bridges or sequencers, those are kind of the prerequisites of interoperating them. That story hasn't been told yet. They're just starting to work. It's just starting to become very easy to deploy an L2.
00:18:10.394 - 00:19:10.282, Speaker B: We recently saw Coinbase launch the base L2 on Ethereum, which is really exciting. But the story of how they interoperate has not been told. We're just getting over the first stages of scaling and I think that there will be a lot to learn in terms of the way they interoperate with Ethereum, the way they interoperate with each other and other blockchains. There's also the story of the user experience. Just how is it that a user should reason about where their assets are and where their objects are and where the games they're playing? Are all those different types of things? At first glance, it is a little bit challenging. Then again, we've seen in the rest of computing and the Internet, people have found ways to abstract the underlying infrastructure that people are using in a way that maintains its usability and allows people to retain choice but still not worry about what's going on underneath the hood. So we'll have to see there.
00:19:10.282 - 00:19:11.660, Speaker B: Thanks for that question.
00:19:18.290 - 00:19:57.354, Speaker C: So speaking of infrastructure, we've been talking a lot about that since we released the last State of Crypto report. We saw Ethereum successfully complete its transition to proof of stake, which is super exciting for all of us. I think it will go down as one of the most significant upgrades in the history of open source software development. And the result, as you can see from the slide here, was a 99.9% reduction in energy consumption. Eddie and I were just talking about this the other day. It does seem like most of the environmental objections to using Ethereum have rightfully gone away.
00:19:57.354 - 00:20:57.950, Speaker C: And I think that's fantastic for the industry. But in addition to the kind of massive reduction in energy consumption, proof of stake also brings us a couple of other benefits. One is more efficient security. So $1 of the Ethereum security budget now goes about 20 times as far. It's also more fair and decentralized in the sense that you no longer need specialized hardware or technical skills to set up a validator it's easy to stake. And then lastly, we also now get this property where finality is no longer probabilistic, which is actually a very important property for many of the scaling solutions that we're building today. And so in addition to the energy consumption, there's also a lot of really great benefits that proof of stake brings us and we're very excited to see that that transition happened successfully.
00:20:58.450 - 00:21:07.806, Speaker A: Darren, you described it as one of the most significant events in open source history. Just maybe you could elaborate on that. Why was it so significant? Why was it so momentous?
00:21:07.998 - 00:21:41.440, Speaker C: Well, part of the reason was that they were kind of improving the plane while it was in flight. Right. There was significant kind of real world activity that was happening on Ethereum and they had to not only kind of make this upgrade but do it without breaking all of the existing applications and tools and products that were built on top of very and in a kind of fully open source, transparent way. Right. And so I think a remarkable achievement for the Ethereum community that they should be incredibly proud of.
00:21:42.210 - 00:22:02.500, Speaker B: Totally agree. It was a momentous day. I'll never forget it. It was totally uneventful and it's almost outrageous to me how it has disappeared into memory just a few short months ago. Which is great, right? Because that means it was totally seamless. I bet some people don't even know what happened.
00:22:03.270 - 00:22:04.926, Speaker A: No news was good news, right?
00:22:05.048 - 00:22:06.150, Speaker B: Yeah. Totally.
00:22:08.490 - 00:22:54.910, Speaker C: Sweet. I guess if we go back one slide, if we want to further contextualize the energy consumption of proof of stake Ethereum just because I think this is something that a lot of people are interested in, we can compare it to other well known products and industries. For example, ethereum now consumes zero zero one percentage of the energy that is consumed by YouTube. And you can see just how small that is in comparison. Of course, I will kind of make the caveats here that there are nuances when it comes to making these comparisons. For example, the energy consumed from watching a video on YouTube might have otherwise been spent on getting in a car and driving to the movie theater. The world of course is very dynamic.
00:22:54.910 - 00:24:03.178, Speaker C: But I think critically here we have removed what was really by definition wasteful energy consumption from proof of work ethereum, which I think is a big win for the crypto industry. I also want to make this point that a lot of people think staking is just about earning money and there's some APY that you can get from staking your ETH. But of course it's so much more than that for ethereum. It's used to secure a 400 billion dollar economy of ETH tokens and NFTs. One metric that we like to track is the ratio of total value secured to total value staked, which today is about 13 x. It's not wrong to say that a lower ratio implies more security, but to really fully understand the implications of that, you need to analyze several different factors. This is something that we've talked about internally with our research team and I'm happy to share more thoughts on that if people are interested or have questions.
00:24:03.178 - 00:24:06.940, Speaker C: But in the interest of time, maybe we can move on.
00:24:08.270 - 00:24:54.860, Speaker B: Yeah, here's two of our favorites. I know we talk a lot about zero knowledge. Zero knowledge has been around for a long time. It has a deep academic history. I recommend you look at our zero knowledge canon on the A 16 C crypto site. It's fantastic, but blockchains have given it new life and that's because there's super interesting things you can do with it. In brief, ZK allows for scaling because it creates very succinct representations of facts and it can be used for privacy because you can very finely control what kinds of things you share and proving specific facts that we're vealing what's underneath them.
00:24:54.860 - 00:25:24.370, Speaker B: So what things that are unpacking. Recently we'll show more on the next slide. Hardware costs are radically decreasing for zero knowledge because the economic demand is materializing. Tons of cool courses. There's the ZK learning online. MOOC. It's amazing some of the members of our research team participate in that super incredible resource and high level programming languages that take advantage of them are starting to mature and so we're seeing the space unfold.
00:25:24.370 - 00:25:38.520, Speaker B: Many of you who are deep in crypto have heard a lot about Zkevms and there's some interesting and contentious discussion between them. Those are signs of growth, those are signs of advancement in the underlying tech. So it's very exciting to see.
00:25:39.610 - 00:26:02.634, Speaker A: By the way, one use case that we didn't even go into on this slide. One of our partners at the firm, Elena Berger, just wrote a great piece about how zero knowledge can be used to apply checks and balances on artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI is obviously a super hot topic right now. Maybe, Eddie, you could just provide a little bit more information on yeah, yeah.
00:26:02.692 - 00:27:07.894, Speaker B: Just maybe a very brief piece. Elena's piece goes into detail on this and it's totally worth reading. I'll say that in short, if you're running an AI model, besides trying to reason about whether you're dealing with a human, you probably want to be able to reason about what model you're using and are you using the right model? Are the inputs to the model something that you can control and keep private? There's so many fascinating questions, and we will probably require verifiable computation. So the ability to know whether an inference or output of a model is what you expected and what you requested, or whether or not a model was trained on data, or in a way that respects the underlying privacy of data creators or data providers or the people who have trained the model or put data somewhere on the Internet. Verifiable computation is going to be a big part of the story of AI. We could probably spend a whole podcast talking about it at some point. Robert so I'm kind of glossing over it, but it's a fascinating one.
00:27:07.894 - 00:28:00.200, Speaker B: But to do that, of course, we will need zero knowledge to scale. And there's a whole bunch of things that are part of the scaling story. One is academic publications advancing the actual science which have been accelerating in recent years, partly as a result of blockchain's revitalizing interest in the field GitHub stars are increasing at a rapid clip. More ZK proofs are being verified on ethereum. This kind of plays into the slide we were showing earlier about consumption of L, two block space. And critically, in the bottom right corner, we can show that the key sort of technical parameters, the performance of zero knowledge systems, are also rapidly scaling prover time, proof size, and verifier time. And I'll say a little bit very briefly what each of these are.
00:28:00.200 - 00:28:42.702, Speaker B: Prover time is the amount of time it takes to generate a zero knowledge proof. There is overhead in the process of generating this, and that is coming down. The size of the proof is also a key parameter because if you can prove very complicated large things in a very small amount of space, that ratio is how you decide. It's one of the key pieces in deciding how much it can scale and the last is verifier time, how much time it takes once you receive that proof to know that it reflects what it claims to reflect. So because these are being used in production, because these industries are maturing, they're scaling incredibly rapidly and I think it's incredibly exciting.
00:28:42.846 - 00:29:02.842, Speaker A: So this slide mentions Moore's Law, which is the idea that performance of semiconductor chips doubles every roughly two years. It's interesting to see such a rapid pace here in zero knowledge. Is that a trend that we can expect to continue into the future? What are the smartest brains kind of thinking about?
00:29:02.976 - 00:29:58.554, Speaker B: How that's a great question and I'm weary of prognosticating about it. Right? On the one hand, the past is preamble, right? And this is how stories unfold in technology is rapid compounding advancements. So that feels like a pretty solid empirical ground to take. On the other hand, you never know. Different very complex fields often advance in fits and starts, so it's hard to predict. But there is an interesting although the Moore's Law comparison is certainly a little bit of a metaphor, I think it's particularly interesting metaphor because part of the process of designing zero knowledge systems is in designing what are called zero knowledge circuits. And circuits are a way that we create a representation of a program in zero knowledge using what looks like a little computer.
00:29:58.554 - 00:30:17.070, Speaker B: But it's purely software. And human beings have been very good at advancing and scaling computer programs, despite how hard it is to do so with hardware. So I think that if the space that we're optimizing is just software space, I'm bullish.
00:30:18.550 - 00:30:33.560, Speaker A: By the way, we've mentioned a bunch of pieces related to zero knowledge. This is an area we track quite closely.

00:30:34.490 - 00:30:35.240, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:36.730 - 00:31:28.330, Speaker C: Awesome. Now we're going to shift a little bit here and talk about NFTs and more specifically, their role in the creator economy. In the last two years, NFT marketplaces have paid out nearly $2 billion worth of royalties in secondary sales to creators. Note that this doesn't include any revenue that's generated from primary sales, which is actually a much higher number. But even the $2 billion is not insignificant when you consider that Facebook earmarked only a billion dollars for creators over multiple years, despite having 3.6 billion users on their platforms, compared to the tens of millions in Web Three. Now, with all of that said, you can see the chart has gone down and creator royalties have been a topic of heated debate over the last few months.
00:31:28.330 - 00:32:27.914, Speaker C: And the core issue around that stems from the lack of a viable on chain enforcement mechanism. And because of that, the industry is actively exploring alternative solutions. This is also an area that we spent a lot of time thinking about internally as a team. So if there are more questions that people have around that, happy to dive into it later. We also think it's worth mentioning that many of the world's biggest brands are exploring Web Three, with NFTs being the most popular entry point. Some recent examples include brands like Starbucks. Which started an NFT based loyalty program, Reddit, which onboarded millions of users through their collectible avatar, NFTs, and most recently, Gucci, which launched a partnership with Ugolabs's Metaverse project called Other Side, which is a cool experience that I encourage people to check out.
00:32:27.914 - 00:32:40.480, Speaker C: And it's very obvious when you just look at this slide here that there is a huge opportunity to onboard new users into crypto. And so we're very excited to continue watching this and see what else is to come.
00:32:40.930 - 00:33:21.980, Speaker A: Hey, Darren, on the previous slide about NFT royalties, I think there's an important point to be made about take rates and about marketplaces that let you trade NFTs. One of the interesting points just on the slide immediately prior to this one is when you can genuinely own a digital asset, a digital item object, whatever, you can go to whatever platform you want and sell it there. And so it creates this intense competition among marketplaces. I think it kind of goes to show about the structurally low take rates in Web Three. It's a really good example of that.
00:33:22.430 - 00:33:55.106, Speaker C: That's exactly right. And it goes back to what Eddie was saying at the beginning of this presentation around how the network design has economic consequences. All the stuff about having the right to exit. I can take my NFT, like OpenSea doesn't charge a low take rate because they're nice. Right. They charge a low take rate because I can take the assets that are mine, that I rightfully own to another platform if I want to. Right? And so there is that increased competition, lower pricing power, which ultimately leads to lower take rates and better outcomes at the end of the day for end users.
00:33:55.106 - 00:33:59.160, Speaker C: So definitely an important point that I think we want to hit hard.
00:33:59.930 - 00:34:05.050, Speaker A: Is this a Solvable problem, by the way? I feel like people are probably interested to know that.
00:34:05.200 - 00:34:55.900, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is. And it may not have to do with royalties on transfer as we have today. Royalties on transfer are the first way that we've really experimented that has some product market fit and started to grow. This industry in the form we recognize today really only started to take shape late 2021, mid 2021. It's incredibly new. There has been relatively little opportunity for allowing each kind of business model and each opportunity to unfold. I think it will be Solvable, and I think we'll reach an interesting equilibrium where the underlying truth that the relationship between creators and their fans has been disintermediated in the good sense.
00:34:55.900 - 00:35:11.120, Speaker B: They have a direct relationship now, and the consequences of that are playing up. I think this will be solved, but we'll see what form it takes. It may not be transfer on royalty on transfer. It might be something altogether new, but the design space is very big.
00:35:12.050 - 00:35:15.186, Speaker A: A little rave sunshine for our creators out there.
00:35:15.288 - 00:35:18.580, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just a matter of time.
00:35:19.670 - 00:35:55.390, Speaker C: Awesome. So we were just talking about the onboarding new users into crypto. And I think games could end up playing a very important role in that regard to the Web Three vision. $68 billion was spent on in game purchases last year. So clearly there is a huge audience to build for. Our crypto fund, actually in partnership with our games fund has invested in a large number of very high quality games teams. And the thing about games, especially the kind of high quality games, is that the good ones take a really long time to build.
00:35:55.390 - 00:36:53.214, Speaker C: But we know from our kind of recent activity that the product pipeline here is extremely strong. So we're excited to continue to watch the space as these new games launch in the months and years to come. One thing I always like to say is that people who earn crypto playing games are going to naturally be drawn to things like DeFi when they look to generate, yield or exchange their tokens or borrow. It's just a natural kind of transition for them. So again, speaks to that ability for games to onboard new users into the space. And we haven't even talked yet about kind of open worlds which may initially look like games, but can ultimately lead to these metaverse type experiences which are even bigger opportunities. So a lot to be excited about when we think about Web Three gaming and the potential there a quote from.
00:36:53.252 - 00:37:01.700, Speaker A: Chris Dixon comes to mind here. He likes to say that the next big thing starts out looking like a toy and what looks more like a toy than a game.
00:37:02.550 - 00:37:03.154, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:37:03.272 - 00:37:05.700, Speaker A: Keep in mind exactly right.
00:37:08.570 - 00:38:07.766, Speaker C: Web Three has also been a great place to experiment with new forms of governance and we've actually seen a lot of really cool innovation. Some good examples are things like Nounsdao, which has created a model to generate recurring revenue with community driven funding of new projects. We're also seeing protocols like Lido experiment with new concepts like dual Token governance which adds more checks and balances to their governance system. And continued progress in how Dows interface with the real world through banking and legal entities, which I think is going to unlock even more opportunity to really build out the Dow space. I think for this area in particular, I think we're still super early, right? I think we're running the early experiments of governance, but I think there is so much more to come here and is again an area I'm really personally excited about.
00:38:07.868 - 00:38:21.260, Speaker B: Yeah, same programmable. Governance is a huge design space. We have yet to see all the experiments and we require a lot more UX and a lot more tech before we can explore the whole thing.
00:38:22.270 - 00:39:19.454, Speaker C: And just to look at some data here, we have seen really positive momentum when it comes to participating in Dow governance. 13 million votes casted across nearly 2 million unique voters and 78,000 unique proposals. And when you look at this data over time, by the way, this is looking at voting activity on Snapshot, which is a popular platform for Dows. It's been growing even in the bear market. I think there's something to be said about the user experience of not having to pay for gas on each transaction, which makes it easier for people to actively participate, but really cool to see that active participation is growing. And I think there's some cool numbers here to unpack. But I'm now going to pass it back to Eddie, who can talk about one of the most important pieces of our report, which is the trends that we're seeing in the US.
00:39:19.454 - 00:39:26.794, Speaker C: And how the regulatory and policy environment will play a critical role in shaping the future of these technologies.
00:39:26.922 - 00:39:48.550, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. I mean, one data point, not a happy one for me, is that the proportion of crypto developers in the US. Seems to be shrinking. And that's not because the number of crypto developers in the US. Overall has shrunk meaningfully. It's just a change in the pace of growth in the US versus non US. Sources.
00:39:48.550 - 00:40:47.398, Speaker B: I'd love to be able to get underneath the hood and to be able to prognosticate about exactly why developers may be preferring to move out of the US. Or maybe it's just more appealing to developers outside the US. But I think it's fair to say that there's a lot more that the US. Could do and that's in particular relating to policy and regulation of crypto, which is going to be critical in shaping the future of crypto in the US. Just a couple quick points, and these come from our policy team that spends a lot of time thinking about these things. Banning new business models and technologies is not the American way of handling technology, as far as I know, and probably something that we need to reconsider if that's really the path that we're headed down. Clear regulation and clear rules protect consumers.
00:40:47.398 - 00:41:53.422, Speaker B: There's a reason why those rules are in place and have been successful in fostering American economic growth in other industries over the last decades. We probably need that here, but it can't be regulation by enforcement and opaque to would be builders who have to select where they're going to do their work. Crypto businesses that aren't breaking the law need access to financial services, and businesses are reasonable entities to regulate. That's the way things work. But protocols and decentralized systems that don't actually have a single source or a single party controlling them probably aren't. Understanding that requires understanding the technology to some degree, and I'm hopeful that that'll unfold. There's all kinds of fascinating ways that regulation is being debated today, and we highlight here some key bills to watch and some key cases that are unfolding.
00:41:53.422 - 00:42:52.718, Speaker B: Super interesting stuff. Not my specialty, but nevertheless incredibly consequential for the US. Thankfully, there are some early signs that there is bipartisan momentum as our legislators learn more and get deeper into crypto and kind of understand the full consequences of this type of technology. So I'm very hopeful. And with that we're going to get into back into some key market metrics. So I hope you enjoyed the trends to watch, I'll say a little bit to link us back to where we started. If there are financial cycles and product cycles, or if there is innovation in the underlying technology and there is adoption of that technology, we should be able to identify key indicators that show us how far along we are in terms of their development.
00:42:52.718 - 00:43:19.770, Speaker B: And those, thanks to the open source and public nature of crypto, open source code, open data, all these fantastic places we can look, we can probably find those indicators and they can probably be more precise, more interesting and more insightful than just looking at prices or market capitalizations of tokens or things like that. So I'm going to hand it to Darren to walk us through some of these indicators.
00:43:21.250 - 00:44:01.530, Speaker C: Thank you. So starting with the supply side of the market, which we call innovation, there's a number of KPIs that we can look at and analyze over a period of time. And we've identified seven metrics here that we are choosing to track and show since the beginning of 2016. So I'm going to step through each of these, but I'm going to do so pretty quickly in the interest of time. All of this data is kind of in the report. It's also part of the State of Crypto index, which we'll talk about after this. But let's maybe just jump through quickly the different slides.
00:44:01.530 - 00:45:13.194, Speaker C: Active Developers so this is the number of unique GitHub users who have committed to or forked a public crypto repository during the month. I think a cool kind of long term upward trend that we're seeing here. Bull markets bring in the developers and there are signs that those developers are sticking around, which is really cool to see and speaks to that kind of price innovation cycle that we talked about in the beginning of the report. We also can look at a larger set of developers, including not only unique GitHub users who have committed to or forked a crypto public repository, but also those who have starred, which is a little bit less of an active engagement, but represents kind of more interest in the space. And we're seeing now more than 50,000 developers are interacting with these GitHub repositories monthly and that number has grown over the years, which is cool to see. Contract Deployers so this is the number of unique addresses deploying smart contracts on the different blockchains that we track. And you can see a really rapid growth in the number of unique deployers.
00:45:13.194 - 00:46:18.790, Speaker C: I think that can be attributed to some of the rise in NFT activity that we saw. Note that NFTs are each a unique contract and so the act of launching an NFT means deploying a contract. We've also seen much better tooling emerge that has made this process a lot easier. So cool to see continued growth there. We can also look at something called Verified Smart Contracts which is the kind of process of verifying the code that you deployed through a block Explorer which is in many ways a leading indicator of kind of the pipeline of product launches. So really cool to see that continue to grow even in the bear market, developers are definitely continuing to stay active. Another kind of lens that we can look at this through is developer Library downloads, specifically Web Three and Ethers which are tools to help crypto users interact with smart contracts that are being deployed through a front end.
00:46:18.790 - 00:46:55.426, Speaker C: And this chart is pretty much up and to the right showing kind of steady growth in the dev community. Academic publications is also an interesting one. We've built a kind of pipeline, a data pipeline internally to fetch data from Dblp and kind of tag metadata based on keywords. And it's very clear that crypto now has become a significant area of academic research. We have a research team internally that is helping kind of contribute on that front, but cool to see in the data and track going.
00:46:55.608 - 00:47:00.226, Speaker B: Yeah, very, very cool. One unique I think and also look.
00:47:00.248 - 00:47:24.250, Speaker C: At job search interests. So this is just looking at Google Trends. We have kind of a special process for how we analyze that data. But you can see that when crypto prices go up it definitely generates interest in crypto related jobs. And it's cool to see that there's now kind of a legitimate industry for full time employment in the crypto space and that continues to show very positive signs.
00:47:26.110 - 00:47:55.982, Speaker A: It's interesting transition back and just see the big picture on some of these slides and comparing it to the slide way back when we talked about the price innovation cycle. You just look at the shape of these charts and you can see which areas are a little bit more cyclical, a little bit more affected by market sentiment compared to a lot of the things related to building activity are kind of staying elevated or higher. It's really interesting to see that from a kind of macro perspective.
00:47:56.046 - 00:48:54.200, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like this slide is pretty representative. I mean there's a couple of interesting sort of archetypical patterns here but it's clear that when crypto is at its most hot, job searches are going to go to their hottest, right? People think people are searching for opportunity, makes a lot of sense and the more you're hearing about it, the more sort of social media waves that are made by crypto projects. Like the more interest people might have, the more possibility there is to find a really cool job in crypto. And even despite dropping, we can see that where we've kind of started to level out even on job searches. And this pattern is true in many other slides. We're way above where we were before, we're near where we were at the prior peak. If that zigzag pattern holds then I think that that's a sign that there's underlying maturity forming in the industry and that's kind of a key pattern that I hope that we can pull out.
00:48:55.610 - 00:50:09.360, Speaker C: That's a great totally moving to the demand side of the market now we can look at what we call the adoption indicators and similar to kind of the supply side I'll step through each of them individually. The first is active addresses so this is the number of unique sending addresses across all of the blockchains that we track and this is really cool to see that it has continued to grow despite kind of the volatility in the market and in the prices like we've talked about. We are finding new ways to engage with blockchains and with web3 products which is resulting in a growing number of active addresses on a kind of similar dimension. We can look at transactions, which is the number of successful transactions that have been kind of completed during the month. And this has really scaled largely as a result of just more block space becoming available through alternative layer. Ones and L2s that have reduced transaction fees for users, which kind of unlocks a new wave of potential for transacting on chain. And you can see kind of the rapid growth there.
00:50:09.360 - 00:50:54.462, Speaker C: We can also look at transaction fees paid which is really just the overall amount of money that people are paying for block space across the different blockchains. Now this one's a little bit nuanced because of course as demand rises people are going to naturally pay more for that block space. But there's also kind of the supply side of that market which is as scaling tech comes online as we now start to get L2s and other layer ones that reduce the transaction fees you're going to get more block space kind of resulting in less overall kind of net transaction fees paid. And so this one is kind of an interesting metric to unpack but one that I think is still important to track.
00:50:54.596 - 00:52:15.158, Speaker B: Yeah, I really hope we get some thoughts on this one because transaction fees are a key part of the story people talk about and when crypto was in its most chaotic phases, like a little bit over a year ago we saw sky high transaction fees. But what should the transaction fees be? In a healthy system zero could be easily conflated between incredible scaling, massive block space supply or on the other hand total lack of interest and just a total lack of demand and vice versa. Very high transaction fees can be a very negative indicator because the marginal cost of using the systems is too high. That's obviously bad, it's exclusive, it makes it difficult to use. But on the other hand, high transaction fees mean that users are willing to pay and that their estimation of what makes activity worthwhile is high. It's like a good analog might be like electricity, right? What's the ideal electrical cost? Extremely high. Seems bad if you're a consumer, but it also means that the system is healthy and the economy has an incredible demand for energy, which is probably a positive because it means that energy is being used.
00:52:15.158 - 00:52:35.230, Speaker B: On the other hand, if energy costs are extremely low, it could mean that we're in an economic slump. Everyone knows gas prices, like petroleum gas prices go down when the economy is in a recession. So it's a similar pattern. But overall I think that it's an important one to show and we're interested in seeing how people, if people agree with our interpretation.
00:52:35.570 - 00:53:06.280, Speaker A: Now, if we think back to the earlier slide on L two S, that sort of kicked off the Key trends section where you have this rocketing up of usage 7% of fees paid on Ethereum are paid through L. Two S. Given that uptick, that upsurge of people using L two S and scaling tech, does it make sense to keep putting this slide in the index like in the future? Is this something that you think we should maintain, given the weird nuances around it?
00:53:07.130 - 00:53:47.074, Speaker B: It's a great question. I think it would be a little short sighted to leave it out of the story altogether because I think it's really important in showing if you looked at a graph of total global energy production in Joules and also total costs of energy globally in dollars. Right. The closest analog in crypto would be like total block space in terms of bytes or some unit of compute proxy a little bit difficult to measure. And then total transaction fees paid. I think in the healthiest possible world you'd want to see the total amount of fees paid growing slowly, but the total amount of space growing faster. Right.
00:53:47.074 - 00:54:08.700, Speaker B: Because you want there to be a lot of space, but you want it to be economically worthwhile every time someone uses it and then to demonstrate that with a willingness to pay. It's a really nuanced one, but it's one that I think should be out there and it's probably more important to have top of mind than, for example, mere prices. So leave it at that.
00:54:09.630 - 00:54:49.122, Speaker C: Moving on. Mobile wallet users. So this is something that we also like to look at and the reality is, since the early 2022 that number has been declining. Of course, I think this tracks market sentiment. I think there's also some interesting stories to kind of further analyze or unpack here, especially when you contrast it to the number of active addresses growing. I think, one, we still need to kind of find better user experiences when it comes to kind of using mobile wallets in particular. I think there are a lot of great companies trying to solve these problems, but they are far from solved.
00:54:49.122 - 00:55:25.090, Speaker C: I also think there is kind of this aspect of products that are creating wallets for users that are native to the application. So kind of behind the scenes creation of a wallet that allows a user to kind of interact on chain but doesn't necessarily require them to bring their own wallet or more specifically, their mobile wallet, which could be kind of explaining some of the differences here. But this is a number that we would like to see kind of rebound and we'll be kind of tracking it going forward because of course we want more mobile experiences in crypto.
00:55:25.590 - 00:55:39.170, Speaker A: It is such a weird disparity between the active addresses slide that you showed a little bit earlier. You would think that they'd be more closely matched. I mean, it makes you wonder, are people mostly transacting on desktop computers?
00:55:39.330 - 00:55:58.270, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a really interesting question. Maybe Darren has some thoughts, but we'd have to go one click deeper in the analysis and probably source some deeper data. It's one I've thought about for a while. I admit personally, my crypto use does not use a mobile app like mine is on my laptop.
00:55:59.410 - 00:56:00.558, Speaker A: Mine too, actually.
00:56:00.644 - 00:56:14.738, Speaker B: Yeah, and that wasn't always true. Actually, that has been a change for me just because I have grown to appreciate the desktop experience. But obviously we're not necessarily representative, so I'd be really interested in learning.
00:56:14.904 - 00:56:45.886, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say. We've done some preliminary analysis here, but far from kind of the complete picture that we would want to do. And I think we can add this to our list of things to follow up on and if anybody wants to contribute to this type of work, we're more than happy to collaborate. So let us know, please. Dex volume. So this is the total on chain volume on decentralized exchanges. Some really positive signals to look at here.
00:56:45.886 - 00:57:35.930, Speaker C: For one, it's now trading over $100 billion monthly. We've grown for three consecutive months in a row following kind of the big drop. As a result of the bear market uniswap, the most popular decentralized exchange for the last two months have surpassed Coinbase in terms of trading volume. So I think really kind of seeing some signs of stabilization here. I think more organic use cases, less speculative, a lot to be positive about when we look at numbers like this. And honestly, a very similar story for NFT buyers. Clearly there was a lot of speculation that flooded the market during the last NFT wave.
00:57:35.930 - 00:57:58.050, Speaker C: I do think a lot of those speculators have exited and we're starting to see the more organic uses of NFTs emerge. And similar to kind of the data in the Dex volume, we're seeing the last two months really kind of uptick in the number of unique buyers that are engaging in NFTs.
00:57:58.130 - 00:58:55.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope we have the chance to go a little deeper on this one, but it's interesting because NFT volumes as a total are down in this period. But buyers are down much less. And in fact, I'd argue they've stabilized at a pretty high level. The total number of NFT buyers. Given the maturity of the industry and how new it is, I think we've begun to see signs. But these are more sort of anecdotal and in our view as investors is it seems like there's more non speculative use of NFTs, more like patronage style uses, lower value NFTs that are less for constant flipping and more for direct relationships and collaboration and support with artists and creators. I think that that's a little bit of a pattern we're seeing more of, but we don't quite yet have super clean data to share on it yet.
00:58:55.494 - 00:58:56.438, Speaker B: Super interesting one.
00:58:56.524 - 00:59:40.120, Speaker C: And then lastly, we have stablecoin volume. I think this one is an interesting one to look at. It's been growing even in the bear market. I think it's very clear that the demand for stablecoins has remained very high. There are lots of kind of considerations and things to think about when it comes to analyzing stablecoins and kind of the potential future for them and their role in Web Three. But it's very clear that the demand for stablecoins as a product is very high. And I think we'll see continued growth in usage on chain going into the future.
00:59:42.490 - 00:59:51.100, Speaker A: Just a reminder for people, submit your questions. If you've got any questions, comments, thoughts, feedback, et cetera, and we'll answer anything that you send our way.
00:59:52.270 - 01:00:39.430, Speaker B: Yeah, so just a last couple of things. So these slides, these indicators we've shown on the innovation side and the demand side, we are making them visible and we'll update them regularly on our website. This state of crypto index. You can go to our site now to see it. What we do is we collect all the metrics that you saw on the innovation side, all the metrics on the adoption side, and we aggregate them into a graph that I will show you here. You'll see a page just like this on the site and it shows the accumulation of the innovation indicators in the bottom left. That's the kind of reddish graph and the accumulation of the adoption indicators in the bottom right and the total of both at the top in blue.
01:00:39.430 - 01:01:30.806, Speaker B: And I think pretty clearly here, this is kind of what I hope you take away. These look like two different patterns. These are clearly two different cycles and the underlying order is different. And if you disagree with how we've added them up, you'll see more about our methodology on the site. You can go and you can change the weights yourself, because we're not trying to be totalizing and objective and claim this is like some scientific index that shows exactly a perfect tiny synoptic view of what's happening in crypto. We just set weights that we think make a lot of sense, but you can tweak them yourself, you can zero them out, you can set them to 100%, whatever you like. And that's because each of these numbers are based on public data and it's a little bit subjective, which matters.
01:01:30.806 - 01:02:37.360, Speaker B: But I think you'll agree with us as you go through that. There are clearly different indicators of different types of patterns unfolding as crypto develops. So go there to stateacrypto asuscrypto.com stateacrypto to check it out and we have just a couple more little things to show what's next, right? What's next in crypto? So a little bit of prognostication. It's still really early, but the total number of internet users and the total number of active addresses continues to track just behind internet users in the early development of the Internet. Who knows if this pattern will continue to hold? I think it's a little difficult to say. Of course, just merely being an internet user is in a way a lower hurdle than actually actively transacting and being sending a transaction on a blockchain today there's a lot of UX hurdles and other types of reasons, but so far the growth pattern has been similar in some ways.
01:02:37.360 - 01:02:50.446, Speaker B: And note that we're tracking this across a variety of blockchains, but we are deduplicating addresses that are shared across networks. So hopefully the minimum amount of double.
01:02:50.478 - 01:02:58.306, Speaker A: Counting eddie, there's a big range on here, it says 20 to 120,000,000. Why such a gigantic range?
01:02:58.418 - 01:03:42.622, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great point. I wish we could be more precise, but as a result of the pseudonymous nature of crypto, right, where you just have public addresses, public keys and not a name or a household like you could with internet use or with bank account use or something like that, we have to be approximate. It's certainly possible that people use many different addresses. I mean, I know I have many for my things and people do that in those cases. Of course, I don't transact on all of them every month or something like that, but it's a little bit hard to do that mapping. So this is our best estimate of that range and it's why? Because it reflects our imprecision. But what we're trying to highlight is the trend.
01:03:42.622 - 01:04:13.638, Speaker B: Even if there's little reason to believe that the proportion of addresses per user is radically changing. That's probably shifting. But the proportion of users per address is probably within a moderately bounded range on average. Which means we can probably reasonably infer the trend even if we can't exactly infer how many users there are. Hope that answers the question. Yes. So then just some quick thoughts.
01:04:13.638 - 01:04:38.870, Speaker B: I'm not going to enumerate all of these. You can take a look yourself if you see the report. There's a lot of cool things that we think are unfolding in crypto. Some of them we talk about on the podcast, some of them we tweet about. So please let us know your thoughts, let us know what things you expect to come next as a result of all the compounding technological progress in crypto and. I'll leave it at that. There's a disclosure slide.
01:04:38.870 - 01:04:43.910, Speaker B: How should we wrap? Robert?
01:04:44.890 - 01:04:59.690, Speaker A: Yeah. Is it possible for us to show off the index, like live? I know we had some slides in there of the index itself, but yeah, I think so. Pretty cool to throw that up for people to take a look at, maybe manipulate some parameters.
01:05:00.190 - 01:05:01.974, Speaker B: Yeah, let me pull it up.
01:05:02.112 - 01:05:29.442, Speaker A: Great. And by the way, this trend slide of what we're expecting, which was just up there, all those different areas, are things that we're paying very close attention to. We're discussing them constantly on our podcast, Web Three, with a 16 Z, which you can subscribe to wherever you get your podcasts. You can also follow along with us. Our newsletter comes out usually once a week. It's called Web three weekly and it's on substac.
01:05:29.586 - 01:06:00.334, Speaker B: Great. Could you bring my tab on stage? There you go. Boom. So here's the state of crypto live on our site. And you can see here what I was pointing out earlier, which is the overall aggregated index right here. And then the broken out adoption indicators and innovation indicators here. On the right side, you can see all of the indicators that sum together to make the total.
01:06:00.334 - 01:06:46.510, Speaker B: It's worth saying maybe very explicitly that what the index shows is the cumulative net growth for that set of indicators. So a 200 here would be a net cumulative three X growth from when these specific indicators at this point in time began being calculated. If you disagree with how we've calculated them, maybe you think contract deploys, that's worth nothing. Forget smart contract deploys. Instead, I think like Library Downloads, those show people who are working on the weekends. That's important. Active developers, that's really important.
01:06:46.510 - 01:07:10.486, Speaker B: I'm going to double that to 30. And there you go. That changes kind of the shape of the innovation indicators curve. Similarly for adoption indicators, maybe look decks weight, forget about that. What really matters to me, it's NFT buyers, right? That's everything that's like the world is made of NFTs. So there you go. That's some other way of doing it.
01:07:10.486 - 01:07:28.730, Speaker B: You could zero them out. So, again, not trying to be an objective scientific measure, but trying to show how specific metrics from open data sources can be brought together to show a view about how technology is progressing in crypto relating to adoption, relating to innovation.
01:07:30.190 - 01:07:56.360, Speaker C: And Eddie, maybe you can also just scroll down to show people that we can also see the underlying metrics. And you can click into each of these underlying metrics to actually get a kind of more detailed view which shows the description of exactly what is being calculated, the source. And again, this data will be updated monthly going forward, so something that we can continue to to track together.
01:07:57.850 - 01:08:21.790, Speaker A: So we've talked about the price innovation cycle moving through multiple waves. We've said that we're probably in wave four right now. And on this index, however, we start from the year 2016, which is well after Bitcoin launched in 2009. So why start the index at that date in 2016 rather than earlier?
01:08:23.330 - 01:09:24.450, Speaker B: That's a great question. Happy to have you, Wayne. Darren, the key point is that it really took until Ethereum before we started to see a variety of these specific key indicators, even materialize, obviously contract deployers, verified smart contracts and key developer libraries, all of those require there to be something, a fully programmable smart contract platform like Ethereum to launch. So in order for the index to be really robust and broad and to draw from a wide variety of sources so that it's kind of representative of the overall form of each size of the space, we decided to start the index at that period. And you'll see that's actually when, if you zoom out, that's when most activity starts. The amount of activity back from the 2016, 2015 and prior period is pretty small. There's just not a lot happening in crypto, really.
01:09:24.450 - 01:09:31.010, Speaker B: The vast, vast, vast majority of development of all types in crypto began after that period.
01:09:34.640 - 01:10:01.604, Speaker A: Makes you wonder what Wave Five is going to be like. Eddie, maybe you could refresh this view and just show the original indicators versus or sorry, the innovation indicators versus adoption indicators and maybe just provide a word for us on the difference between the way those charts operate in what they're displaying of what we're seeing.
01:10:01.642 - 01:10:35.920, Speaker B: Yeah. In totality, it's clear to me that adoption is more volatile, more cyclical, more linked to the financial cycle. It can come and go. If this adoption indicator chart went down over the next year, I wouldn't be surprised. Now, I'm not necessarily betting on that, I'm not hoping for it, but it just wouldn't shock me. Whereas you can see the innovation side that's progressing much more steadily. Yeah, there's periods where it kind of goes sideways or kind of bounces around or has peaks and troughs, but they're much more smooth and consistent.
01:10:35.920 - 01:10:59.960, Speaker B: It's no question to me that these two things are unfolding at different paces because of different underlying facts. And I think I'd love to hear from other people what kinds of open public data sets they'd like to include to make these more robust or different ways they think it should be calculated that would make it more representative, more accurate.
01:11:00.540 - 01:11:23.490, Speaker C: Yeah, I would double down on that if anybody has thoughts or ideas or wants to work on this with us. The cool thing about this, this is all public data, like we've said many times now, and so we can truly work on it together with the community and take feedback and kind of just collaborate in various ways. So I would encourage people to just reach out to us if they have ideas. There could be a great opportunity to work together.
01:11:23.940 - 01:11:57.480, Speaker A: That's a great point. You guys know where to find us, on Twitter, on Farcaster, LinkedIn, YouTube, wherever you're watching us, feel free to send us a note, give us your feedback, tell us why you disagree vehemently with the parameter choices we've made, and we can make this bigger and better next year. We've got a couple questions in the chat that have come through from people. Maybe we could just go over them quickly, please. First one is, how do you account for custody crypto addresses which are contained in an omnibus account like Coinbase?
01:11:57.640 - 01:12:43.880, Speaker B: Yeah, so exchanges like Coinbase use typically multiple omnibus addresses. They'll have like I'm just making this up is obviously not my business, but like ten key omnibus addresses and they'll receive different types of tokens, that would actually be something we'd be undercounting. Right? Because if 100 people or 1000 or 10,000 people had their balances virtually reflected in a single or in ten coinbase deposit omnibus addresses, we would really only count that as ten. Now, they would be active probably every day, because my presumption is that the exchanges will be using them, but they would radically undercount the number of users and their intentions and their activities that are being represented.
01:12:44.540 - 01:13:05.280, Speaker C: And in a way, it's a counterbalancing force to the fact that we have imprecision around kind of one user equals one address, as Eddie was mentioning earlier. And so it speaks to just like the imprecision in this whole analysis when you look at addresses, but there's different forces that ultimately, I think, make it a pretty decent proxy.
01:13:07.220 - 01:13:19.910, Speaker A: And you're sort of alluding to this next question that somebody asked about the inferred user ratio, the ratio between users and addresses. What is our sort of take on that?
01:13:20.920 - 01:13:38.830, Speaker C: It's a really good question that I think we would maybe need to dig into. There's a couple of things that come to mind as to how you may be able to approximate that, but nothing that I have top of mind right now, but something that is a really good question that we should put on our list.
01:13:43.680 - 01:14:03.540, Speaker A: Okay, one more question. In terms of companies and technologies in the space, what are some of the factors used to determine who's VHS and who's Beta, those being two famous cassette technologies of the past, of a bygone era?
01:14:04.040 - 01:14:12.500, Speaker B: Yeah, VHS versus Beta, it's a fascinating one. I wish I knew better the history of exactly why VHS beat Betamax.
01:14:14.220 - 01:14:14.536, Speaker C: To.
01:14:14.558 - 01:14:55.156, Speaker B: Stretch the analogy further. But I think it really depends. Space by space, it's something that we try to do, obviously, we try to understand the key technologies in the space that are transient or temporary, or the technologies that are really going to underpin a whole new wave of economic development. I'll tell you right now, like ZK, multiparty compute, fully homomorphic encryption, those are not Betamax, those are VHS big time. So get ready. But as far as different specific programming models or specific Zkbms, it's really hard to say. We could go specific.
01:14:55.156 - 01:15:45.910, Speaker B: By specific, I'd say the key factor is just when there's a new kind of technology? What specific challenge is it trying to address and how resilient and flexible is that solution to the next wave of development? Maybe in VHS versus Betamax, it all came down to who had the right business development. Maybe it was which company plugged the right deals and helped build more VHS players? Maybe that was some key business strategic thing. Maybe it had nothing to do with the underlying technology. On the other hand, maybe there was a key. Maybe one is much more expensive to produce than the other at the limit. Maybe they have different fidelity characteristics that were important, or maybe those weren't important. Maybe it has to do with the duration of the tapes, things like that.
01:15:47.080 - 01:16:12.860, Speaker A: Interesting question, if I'm remembering my consumer tech history. Well, I believe Betamax had a more closed platform and VHS was more interested in partnering. Like you said, some of these business development deals and kind of let their technology proliferate. And to me that kind of speaks to the difference between Web three and Web two. The difference between openness and being closed.
01:16:13.360 - 01:16:22.880, Speaker B: Yeah, well, a friend of mine just texted me that it's because on VHS you can put more on a tape even though the quality is worse. Maybe apocryphal knowledge. Thanks Josh.
01:16:27.060 - 01:17:03.800, Speaker A: Any other historians out there who know about the battle between VHS and Betamax, feel free to reach out with feedback for us on our take here, our attempt to reconstruct history. But Eddie and Darren, thank you so much for this conversation. Fascinating, illuminating, deep dive. If I were to summarize three takeaways here from this presentation, I would say the market is doing much better than prices appear to indicate. The financial cycle and product cycle are just different things. They operate on a different logic. I'd also note that Scaling Tech is going bonkers.
01:17:03.800 - 01:17:41.880, Speaker A: People are really interested in optimistic rollups in, zero knowledge roll ups. And then finally, there are so many new products and applications coming online on chain gaming, NFT related experiences, and so much more. So that's a wrap. Thank you everybody, for again, if you got more feedback to share, you know where to find us. Hit us up, let us know how we can improve next year's report.
