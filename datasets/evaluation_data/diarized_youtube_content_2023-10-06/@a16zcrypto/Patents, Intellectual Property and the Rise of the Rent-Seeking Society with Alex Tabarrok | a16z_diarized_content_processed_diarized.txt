00:00:10.350 - 00:00:44.058, Speaker A: Very pleased to welcome Alex Taberak, who's a professor at George Mason University. Normally when I introduce economists, like for a talk, I often feel obliged to kind of mention their specialization. Like I'll say, oh, they're a market designer, or maybe if they're really general, I'll say they're a microeconomist. But Alex, I have to say, just he's an economist, he's so rod. He's worked on sort of economics of crime, health economics, including a lot of work on vaccine distribution. More recently he's done work in crypto as well. And then today he's going to be telling us about intellectual property.
00:00:44.058 - 00:00:46.218, Speaker A: Should be really interesting. So Alex, all yours.
00:00:46.314 - 00:01:21.414, Speaker B: Great. Thanks very much, Tim. Yeah, no crypto, no blockchains today. That would violate comparative advantage. So I'm going to talk about patents, copyrights, intellectual property more generally and what I call the rise of the rent seeking society. So if you take a look at the number of patents issued in recent times, you can see it was actually pretty flat through most of the 20th century. And then you see this big increase beginning in the 1980s with this creation of the Federal Circuit Court, special Patent Court in 1982.
00:01:21.414 - 00:02:13.222, Speaker B: We'll come back to that and when you first look at this and you think, oh well, yeah, sure, I mean, listen, patents are going up and all of this innovation and computers and it makes sense we live in a high tech society to see this big increase in patents. And yet however, when you take a look at productivity, at total factor productivity, what you see is that there was a massive decline in total factor productivity. This is what my colleague Tyler Cowan calls the great stagnation. So you have this big increase until 1970, 319, 72, somewhere around there, and then you have this decline in total factor productivity. Briefly catching up a little bit in the 1990s. We'll talk about that and then it's just flat. And in the it's just flat.
00:02:13.222 - 00:02:56.982, Speaker B: Okay. Total factor productivity is like what we care about the most. It is basically how much output you're getting from the same inputs of labor and capital. So basically you're looking at output minus. You sort of take away what you can explain of output from your inputs of capital and labor and then as that changes over time, you're thinking, well, that's technological progress. Right? So a computer today has about the same amount of silicon as 30 years ago, but it's much faster, right? It's much more capable that's total factor productivity. Right? So that's the idea.
00:02:56.982 - 00:04:14.058, Speaker B: And this is really what we care about because this determines our state of living, standard of living. Okay. So it's the ability to get more from less, which is really determinant of our standard of living. There's an interesting way of putting this, by the way, and that is this is kind of an aside, but if total factor productivity had continued to increase on its post World War II to 73 trend, okay? If it had continued to increase on that same trend, we would be living in the world of 2092 rather than in the world of 2023. And I would much rather live in the world of 2092 with better medical care and better technology. All of this, maybe we would have flying cars, okay? So that's just kind of a way of thinking about this. Okay? So what I'm going to talk about, what I want to begin talking about with patents is I first want to convince you that patents are not necessary for at least some types of innovation, and then that patents can actually reduce innovation.
00:04:14.058 - 00:04:50.620, Speaker B: That's a possibility as well. And I want to be clear, I'm not blaming patents for the decline in total factor productivity. That would be a much bigger, much stronger claim. But I do want to make these two claims, okay? Patents are not necessary for at least some innovations, and in some cases, they can reduce innovation. So beginning with the first claim that patents are not necessary, it's actually the case that most innovations are not patented. So we think about economic growth every year. Maybe we're up two, two and a half percent in the United States if we're doing well.
00:04:50.620 - 00:05:37.894, Speaker B: And that's like just millions and millions of improvements in innovations and things getting better and so forth. Most of these innovations are not patented at all. And in fact, there are many fields which are very innovative, which patents are not even allowed or not even used, like fashion. So every year, we're in Fashion district. You walk down the streets and you see new designs and new cuts and new types of clothing, new materials, and so forth. None of this is patented cooking. If you watch Top Chef, you see new recipes, you see molecular gastronomy, new ingredients, sous vide, new techniques.
00:05:37.894 - 00:06:06.638, Speaker B: This is not patented. We didn't used to allow patents for business methods. Nobody really complained, oh, we don't have enough business methods. Okay, we need to patent it to get more business methods. No one was really saying that, but the court said, okay, now business methods can be patented. Even semiconductors. There was actually no IP for semiconductors until quite recently, like 1970s, okay? And we still had plenty of semiconductors.
00:06:06.638 - 00:07:14.330, Speaker B: There's also an interesting historical set of examples. In the 19th century, there was a sort of anti patent movement a little bit similar to what we're seeing today, but it was quite strong in that a number of countries actually got rid of their patent systems, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, pretty major countries. And so the question then became, did these countries become less innovative? And in a very nice paper by Petro Moser, the economic historian, she looks at these countries and finds, in fact, no, they were quite innovative. These countries continued to be among the most innovative countries in the world. The direction of innovation changed a little bit the sort of types of innovations which happened changed a little bit. But overall, these countries, even without patent systems, continued to be very innovative. And I want to spend some time to talk about the most innovative US.
00:07:14.330 - 00:08:22.990, Speaker B: Company, a company you're all familiar with, but you might want to think different, because the company which I'm actually thinking about is Walmart. Walmart. Now, why is Walmart the most innovative US. Company? Well, first of all, let's just point out how incredibly important Walmart is. It is the world's largest private employer, okay? It's over 11,000 stores, 27 countries, the world's largest firm by revenues, almost 611,000,000,000 in revenues last time I checked. It saves consumers, by one estimate, from some years ago, a quarter of a trillion dollars a year. It does actually have low prices, right? And if you remember that productivity boom of the 1990s, which I pointed out in the first slide, turns out that a huge fraction of that came from retailing and a huge fraction of that came from Walmart.
00:08:22.990 - 00:09:13.466, Speaker B: Walmart was simply much more productive than its rivals. By some estimates, 40% more productive in the retail sector than its rivals. And why? How did they do this? How did they pull off this miracle? How did they become the world's largest private employer, the company with the biggest revenues of any other firm? How did that happen? Was it some, like, secret sauce, some technological know, something they had like no, it's none of these things. It was Sam Walton relentlessly improving productivity on multiple margins. Very simple stuff like cross training of the staff in different departments, use of barcodes. So they use, like, some technology. They used RFID chips.
00:09:13.466 - 00:10:00.378, Speaker B: Okay. But this was public technology. This was not something which they had any special access to. In fact, to illustrate that IP and patents was not what made them super productive, you can go and look and ask, how many patents does Walmart have? Stock, how many patents does Walmart have? And when I checked this out, it was like 60. Now, including one for a shoebox. Now, to put this in context, IBM files for, like, 30 patents a day. Okay? So 60 the stock of Walmart.
00:10:00.378 - 00:10:41.078, Speaker B: It's nothing. It's nothing. So Walmart incredibly important, incredibly productive, not based upon IP. Okay? So let's now turn to the costs, some of the costs of intellectual property. And we'll begin kind of with a static example, and probably for even the non economists here have probably seen this diagram before. And what the diagram says, right, is that when you give a patent, that creates a monopoly, which allows the firm to get some profit. And the idea is that profit then allows firms to recoup their sunk costs.
00:10:41.078 - 00:11:22.600, Speaker B: They have some research and development costs. This profit allows the firm to charge higher than market prices for some time period and earn these profits and recoup those sunk costs of research and development. And the idea is that the cost of this is that since the price is above the marginal cost, we have some dead weight loss, we have some transactions which fail to occur, even though they would be socially beneficial because the price is higher than the marginal cost. It's a very standard story. In fact, I've told this story before. It's actually not correct. It actually underplays things.
00:11:22.600 - 00:12:30.460, Speaker B: And you can begin to see that, first of all, this story, you might say, is a little bit uncharitable because, well, you say, oh, well, there's this dead weight loss. But the counterargument to that would be, well, this product wouldn't exist if it weren't for the patent. So how can you say that there's this dead weight loss when the whole thing wouldn't even be there if it weren't for the patent? Okay. And that actually tells you something. It tells you that the cost of the patent system is not actually this dead weight loss, it's the dead weight loss on all the other products which are patented, but where the patent was not required in order to produce the product, in order to produce the innovation. So it's all of these other dead weight losses which is actually part of the cost of the patent system. That's the sort of static story which I think most of you maybe, with the exception of this edition, have probably heard before.
00:12:31.230 - 00:12:42.158, Speaker A: Sorry, Alex, the point there is you're saying the old story is roughly correct if indeed the product would not exist, but for the protection of the patent.
00:12:42.334 - 00:13:15.642, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fine if you're looking at so my point here is that when you're trying to evaluate the patent system, you have to look at not just the product which is created because of the patent, but the monopolies which are created in other products, which would not necessarily be monopolies if we didn't have the patent system.
00:13:15.776 - 00:13:20.560, Speaker A: So patents were only issued to things that would not otherwise be produced, then we'd be okay.
00:13:20.930 - 00:13:27.794, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah, exactly. If we could just pick and choose, right? That's right. Yeah.
00:13:27.912 - 00:13:46.358, Speaker C: So the counter story which may or may not be correct is that, well, we provide temporary monopoly, but this innovation might generate some technological spillovers that may undo this kind of deadway loss at some point.
00:13:46.524 - 00:13:57.900, Speaker B: Sure. That says, yeah, sure. There could also be technological spillovers to the unpatented products as well. Right.
00:13:59.470 - 00:14:09.690, Speaker C: But then the question is whether these innovations may take place or not. So that's kind of like an accounting exercise.
00:14:10.910 - 00:14:11.610, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:14:11.760 - 00:14:29.330, Speaker D: I guess I feel like what you're saying is that Dennis says, okay, all there are all these deadweight losses from giving monopoly rights to all these different side products, but if we're accounting for all the side products, we should also be accounting for all the spillovers from the patented products that would not be produced otherwise.
00:14:29.750 - 00:14:38.662, Speaker B: Sure. But then I would say we should account for the spillovers from the monopolized product. Right. I mean, you get fewer spillovers. Absolutely.
00:14:38.716 - 00:14:56.550, Speaker D: But those products we get under both circumstances. So that doesn't affect the we get those spillovers without patents. We get those spillovers with patents. The question is, how does the monopolization of those sort of side products compare to the spillovers from the products that are only produced if there are sure.
00:14:56.560 - 00:15:41.738, Speaker B: Sure, fair enough, fair enough. Okay, so that's kind of the static story. Yeah. You also get Spence distortions in this case, right. Because you have a patent on something, there's no need to fairly innovate it, so people's quality doesn't improve as fast as you might think it would even in the same products. Now I want to sort of turn to the sort of more dynamic issues which arise with patents. And here I want to contrast sort of a linear innovation model, which is the one which sort of first comes to mind with a more cumulative innovation model.
00:15:41.738 - 00:16:32.858, Speaker B: Okay? So if you have a cumulative innovation model where you're thinking about products which are building on top of other products or ideas which are building on top of other ideas, well, then it can be quickly become sort of obvious that if you have a patent here which is raising the cost, then you could raise the cost of building on top of other ideas. And that can reduce this virtuous circle. Can cut the virtuous circle. So let me give you an example. I'm going to call this the tail of the mouse. The tail of the mouse. And it begins with the uncle mouse, which is the first patented animal, okay? This was in 1998.
00:16:32.858 - 00:17:05.074, Speaker B: It was patented by Harvard and Dupont. It's a new mouse. And it was actually a set of techniques for changing the genes in mice lines. And that's extremely useful because you then study these mice and can learn all kinds of things about disease and treatments and so forth. An onco is cancer. So the first ones that were sort of inserted, these insertion of the genes, were cancer genes. So they created this new mouse.
00:17:05.074 - 00:18:03.638, Speaker B: And as you know, if you build a better mouse, the world will beat a path to your door. Lots of people wanted to use this mouse, but Dupont, they charged a lot of high fees, charged really high fees to just use any of these ideas. You want to use these ideas to insert genes, whether to create, know, an anko rat or a, a primate or okay. Or insertion of other genes. You had to pay Dupont. In addition, you had to report annually, what are you doing with these ideas, these techniques? You have to write an annual report to Dupont. Anyone using these ideas automatically, automatically gave up a share of any of the downstream licensed revenue, and you were not allowed to share your new mice lines.
00:18:03.638 - 00:19:47.580, Speaker B: So if you created, using these techniques, a new type of mouse, you were not allowed to share that. Okay? And that really violated all of these things, but that especially really violated the norms of biological science at the time, because they were much more used to an open access model, they were much more used to the Jackson laboratory model, which is quite of an amazing thing. Like when you create a new mouse, the way it works is you send some examples to the Jackson laboratory, and they keep them for you, they keep them. And then if anybody else wants to study these mice, you can go to the Jackson laboratory, and this is their web page, and you can go and find the mice that you want. So if you want to study, like, fat mice, obese mice, balding mice, cancerous mice, hairy mice, you go to the Jackson laboratory and you find your mouse, and then you can do your studies in a consistent so with all the other papers which have been written on this. So this was not very popular with the scientists and in fact, they began sort of sharing their mice under the table. However, all of this outrage led to an agreement with the NIH to free the onco mouse to lift a bunch of these restrictions, which is what happened in 1999.
00:19:47.580 - 00:22:06.790, Speaker B: They lifted a bunch of these restrictions. And then there's this very clever paper which I've been drawing upon by Fiona Murray and colleagues, which uses this natural experiment to ask, well, what happened when these restrictions were lifted, these IP like restrictions? What happened to the scientific discovery process when these restrictions were lifted? And they're going to do that by looking at scholarly citations, because each new mouse line is associated with a mouse article, the key article, which defined this type of mouse, right? So there are new mouse lines created with the restricted techniques, the dupont techniques, and there are mouselines created using the non restricted earlier techniques, which did not have all of this IP like restrictions. So what Fiona Murray and colleagues do is they do a difference in difference, which is to say, they look at citations to the restricted mouse articles relative to the unrestricted ones before the restrictions were lifted and after the restrictions were lifted. And what they find is that the citations to the mouse articles which were restricted go way up relative to the ones which are always unrestricted. Okay? So there's a flowering of research using these new, now unrestricted mouse lines. Moreover, you find new researchers entering the field, okay? You can see that from the citations. You find experimentation went up as measured by new keywords, and you find new ideas developed in a wide and diverse set of fields as measured by citations from new journals.
00:22:06.790 - 00:22:42.610, Speaker B: So what you really see is the idea that these restrictions really held back the willingness of scientists to use these techniques. And when the restrictions were lifted, you had a big increase in innovation. Moreover, no evidence for a reduction in the number of new mouse lines after the restrictions were lifted. So that's I think, an interesting illustration of how these IP like processes can restrict reduce innovation.
00:22:43.270 - 00:22:48.546, Speaker A: There's a very famous example of that point in crypto which maybe you go.
00:22:48.568 - 00:23:17.238, Speaker B: Ahead schnorr signatures, right, yeah. So I was told last night that Satoshi used the sort of less efficient, less clean Epska, I guess that is citation signature management system as opposed to the schnorr because the schnor was patented. And I think a lot of cryptographers have regretted that ever since.
00:23:17.344 - 00:23:27.210, Speaker C: The irony is that the patent expired the year Bitcoin launched, so it would have been fine. He missed the deadline, but it was just widely perceived as being patented.
00:23:27.290 - 00:24:50.794, Speaker B: Right, yeah. So kind of sort of summing this up. This know, Newton famously said that if I have seen further than others, it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants. And the question then becomes, would Newton have been able to see so far had he had to pay for the privilege of standing on these shoulders? We can also see here that when you have a lot of these patents and IP like restrictions, we can actually get the tragedy of the anti commons. So the tragedy of the commons is when you have a resource which doesn't have owners, it's unowned and you have too many people using the resource and so it becomes overused and under maintained. The tragedy of the anti commons is when you have too many people who can say no, too many people who can say no to use the resource and so the resource becomes underused underused. The idea here is if you're trying to build a product and it depends upon sort of four other products and each of them demands 25% of the profits, that's a problem.
00:24:50.794 - 00:25:57.158, Speaker B: If you're building a product and it depends upon ten other products and each of them demands 20% of the resources, that's a real problem. Real set of transaction scoffs there to get agreement. And in fact we saw this particularly in the early days of the cell phone industry. This is a picture of all of the lawsuits in the cell phone industry. Who was suing who, and obviously this was no way to create innovation. So what happened? Well, we had all of this lawsuits and eventually what happened is you may recall this, but Google, Microsoft, Samsung and so forth, Apple, they went on a patent buying spree and they bought up these billion dollar patent arsenals. And the reason they did that was not because they needed the knowledge in this patent arsenal.
00:25:57.158 - 00:27:04.310, Speaker B: They already had the knowledge. The reason they did this was because they wanted to have a plausible way of countersuing anyone who sued them. So they bought these patent arsenals, these billion dollar patent arsenals, so that someone sued them. They could troll through their arsenal and find plausibly or semi plausibly some patent which they could then use to countersue. Okay, so this led to what I call sort of the mutually assured destruction view of innovation and to give it its, you know, just like mutually assured destruction has managed to avoid nuclear wars. But it still doesn't seem to me to be the ideal way of doing it and doesn't seem to me to be the ideal way of creating room for innovation for one reason, because it's clear that only the big can do this thing. Only the really large companies can afford to buy these patent arsenals.
00:27:04.310 - 00:27:52.998, Speaker B: And in fact, you see this in the data that there has been an inequality, greater rising inequality in patents. Who owns them and who gets them? Okay, so this is the share of patents held by the top 1% of patenting firms. And that's increasing, right? So there's a greater inequality. They become more concentrated, more concentrated in the top, the top 1%, the number of patents created by firms for the very first time creating a new patent, okay, that's been going down, followed by more than 50%. A fall by more than 50%. Yeah.
00:27:53.084 - 00:28:10.266, Speaker C: Alex, isn't there a counterargument on the big versus small that patents basically enable innovation of the small ones that the big could easily imitate and therefore enables the smaller participants to innovate in the first place?
00:28:10.448 - 00:28:54.730, Speaker B: So, I mean, there is this argument that it allows yes, there is that argument that it gives the small firm something to sell, at least. Okay, but if we're thinking about sort of modern innovation, you're typically not building a product on a single patent. It requires creation. It requires using a whole bunch of patents. And that the small firms can't do. That's what the small firms can't do. And as we pointed out, there's fewer and fewer of these small firms with patents, and they're flowing to the big firms.
00:28:54.730 - 00:30:18.178, Speaker B: The big firms are buying the patents. Okay? They are buying up the patents. Again, a really large increase in the share of the top 1% buyers, and small buyers are in the decline. There's also a very interesting paper by Accent and my former student, actually, Nathan Goldschlag, and they have this fantastic database on patents. And all of the scientists, all of the innovators which created the patents, and they can actually track these scientists or these innovators over time. And what they find, first of all, is that the innovators at incumbent firms are increasing, and then they do this micro study where they look at what happens to innovator earnings when the innovators are hired by an incumbent firm relative to very similar innovators who stay at an entrant. Okay? And what they find is that when the innovator is hired at the incumbent firm, their earnings go way up.
00:30:18.178 - 00:31:40.030, Speaker B: Sort of makes sense, but actually their innovation goes down. Okay, so you might ask, well, why are these incumbents hiring these innovators, paying them a lot, and actually seeing their innovation go down? Doesn't quite make sense. But there is at least one story, which not necessarily the only story, but it's one story which makes sense of this data, and that is the arrow replacement effect. So the arrow replacement effect is argument by Ken Arrow, who points out that the cost of innovation to a monopolist is higher than to a competitive firm because the monopolist has an opportunity cost the monopolist that innovation may threaten the profits they already have. So the cost of innovation to a firm which already has these profits is quite high. So they are less likely to want to innovate. One way of doing that is to hire up a bunch of innovators and then put them on some other project which doesn't threaten your monopoly rents.
00:31:40.030 - 00:31:43.534, Speaker B: So that's one story which makes sense.
00:31:43.572 - 00:31:45.594, Speaker C: Of this is this sort of equivalent.
00:31:45.642 - 00:32:20.090, Speaker B: To companies buying patents and then shelving them. Yeah, exactly. That would be the very direct way of doing it. And what this paper shows is that you can do it surreptitiously by hiring the innovators. At least that's, as I say, one explanation for this. These patents then can slow the diffusion, can slow the diffusion of new ideas, reducing growth. And the way they do this is by protecting the leaders from the followers.
00:32:20.090 - 00:32:59.586, Speaker B: And I call this the Tiger Woods effect. The story here is, imagine that Tiger Woods and myself are in a golf game. Well, neither of us is going to put in much effort. Tyler woods because he doesn't have to because he's going to win for sure, and me, because I know I'm going to lose for sure. So I don't put in much effort either. Okay. And a pattern can create a Tiger Woods effect where the leader is insulated from the followers, making it more difficult to catch up, which was reducing the diffusion of ideas.
00:32:59.586 - 00:33:53.866, Speaker B: And this reduction in diffusion of ideas is something which shows up a it shows up a lot of data in the United States and in Europe as well. So this is labor productivity, sort of the value added per worker between the frontier firms and the other firms in the industry. This is for Europe. And what you can see is that there's a bigger gap, a widening gap between the productivity of the top firms and the productivity of the average firm. And one possible explanation again for this is that these technologies, these ideas are not diffusing as rapidly as they have in the past. Okay? That's patents. I want to say a little bit about copyright as well.
00:33:53.866 - 00:34:33.342, Speaker B: It's kind of some fun kind of fun as well. Copyright, a little bit of history. Copyright terms began in 1790 at 14 years, so your copyright would last 14 years. Now, who wrote the first US. Copyright act? Historians have looked at this and you all know the name of this person, this person's book. It's possible it might even be around here somewhere. Any guesses? Anybody know? First Copyright Act was written by Webster.
00:34:33.342 - 00:34:59.090, Speaker B: Okay. Author of Webster's Dictionary, still being sold today. Right? And this guy is Noah Webster. Who was Webster's cousin. Nobody probably again heard this name before. This is Daniel Webster. Okay.
00:34:59.090 - 00:35:38.558, Speaker B: Kind of well known famous senator. And Noah and Daniel Webster were the key players also in the 1831 extension of copyright from 14 to 28 years. All right, so a lot of rent seeking going on. And remarkably, Daniel Webster in the Senate was joined by this guy, oliver Ellsworth in the house. There's no reason you would know this guy's name, Oliver Ellsworth. But who was he? He was Daniel Webster's son in law. Okay? So he was the guy also standing to game by the extension of copyright law once his father in law passed away.
00:35:38.558 - 00:36:59.654, Speaker B: All right? So right from the very beginning, we see these sort of rent seekers try to extend copyright law. Now, it actually stayed after the 1831 expansion from 14 to 28 years. The length stayed, did not increase again. For some period of time, though, the law got much more broad, so it started to apply to many more things, including like news and photographs and technology change. So the law got more broad, but it didn't lengthen very much until in 1976, it was lengthened to Life of the Author plus 50 years. And then it was expanded in 1998 to Life of the Author plus 70 years. Okay? And this is one of my favorite stories, because this expansion to Life of the author plus 70 years, it applied to already existing works, okay? So there's no incentive argument, right? You could say, well, we want to extend copyright so that we will get more authors writing books, but this extension applied to stuff which already existed, right? So there's no possible incentive argument for this expansion, obviously.
00:36:59.654 - 00:38:07.194, Speaker B: However, it is the past authors, particularly the successful ones, who most have the ability to lobby for and who most want an extension. And this expansion in 1998 was opposed in a Friends of the Court brief by George Ackerloff, Kenneth Arrow, Ronald Coast, Milton Friedman, and James Buchanan, to name just the Nobel Prize winning economists who opposed this expansion. A bunch of others as well. Nevertheless, despite this intellectual firepower, never before seen, they lost. And they lost to a mouse. They lost to Disney, right? Disney was the main lobbyist pushing for this in order to keep copyright on Mickey Mouse. You can see some of the costs of expanding this copyright.
00:38:07.194 - 00:38:37.960, Speaker B: This is a neat little paper. As I mentioned, it applied to past existing works. But if a work had gone into the public domain, then it stayed in the public domain. Right? And the cut point was like 1924. So 1923, there was no extension. 1924 there is an extension. And this is the number of in print editions that you could go to Amazon today and find.
00:38:37.960 - 00:39:08.946, Speaker B: So what you see here is that there's a big. Decrease at this cut point with the extension of the copyright law, extension of the copyright term, you get this big decrease in the number of new editions of these works that you could find on Amazon. And prices, of course, are going to be lower here and higher here. Right. And that's just one kind of direct cost. Yeah. Curious why that is the case.
00:39:08.968 - 00:39:12.334, Speaker C: Because I'm assuming even the later books.
00:39:12.382 - 00:39:33.306, Speaker B: Are now free of copyright because it's been 70 years. No, well, no, 1925. Well, would be life of the author plus 70 years. So at the time of the study, these are all still copy. This is at the time of the.
00:39:33.328 - 00:39:35.740, Speaker C: Study, not at the time of the 1998 act.
00:39:37.150 - 00:40:30.934, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the dividing line for the 1998 act. Okay. And so these are still under copyright and these are not. Yeah. Now, that's kind of a direct cost, but there's actually, I think, a much more important sort of indirect cost, and that is to think about the commons, the public domain stuff, as the public domain, as actually being the opportunity of the commons. I call it the opportunity of the commons. And I think about the intellectual commons as a fountainhead, a fountainhead that doesn't run dry, but is a source of ideas to build upon, to remix, to combine, to develop, to change, to alter, and so forth.
00:40:30.934 - 00:40:50.242, Speaker B: So you think about Disney, and he is drawing from the brother's Grim, okay. And reworking these stories from the brother's Grim with Cinderella. Right. And then you get a different version, ella and the Prince, a new telling. Right. A remixing. Right.
00:40:50.242 - 00:41:50.280, Speaker B: And here we have the Hansel and Gretel, and then we have like a modern version of Hansel and These. But you think about Romeo and Juliet, and you can have Romeo and Juliet as a musical in South Beach, right, that kind of thing. Taking from the commons and redeveloping it, remixing it and so forth. Now, it's true that not necessarily all of the remixes are not necessarily good. You might have noticed, heard perhaps recently, that this year Winnie the Pooh went out of you. Thus we have Winnie the Pooh, Blood and Honey, do not take your children to this movie. Under no circumstances should you do that.
00:41:50.280 - 00:43:14.906, Speaker B: But if we think about this commons, it's kind of john Locke said that it's okay to draw from the commons if enough in his good is left for others. Right? Now, this intellectual commons is what I call superlachian, because when the IP law is well designed, everyone who draws from the commons eventually restocks it when their own revisions are come into the public domain. Okay? So IP law is super Lockian in that those who draw from it also restore it, also add to it. And yet the problem here is that not everyone does this. So people sometimes say that people who draw from the commons are free riders, but actually the free riders are the people who do not restock the Commons. So Disney drew from the Commons the brothers Grim and so forth, and the old folk tales disney drew from that, but has not restocked the Commons because they have kept their own works in the private domain by extension of copyright law. And you can see this kind of destruction of the Commons.
00:43:14.906 - 00:43:57.214, Speaker B: And this goes to your point. Had the pre 1976 rules been in place, all of the following works would be available in the Commons today for anybody to rework mix, combine, alter, or expand. Winston Churchill's history of the English Speaking Peoples a Minority Report. Philip K dick James Bond James Bond would today be in the public domain. We would have James Bond like we have Sherlock Holmes or Robin Hood. We don't have that. We don't have that.
00:43:57.214 - 00:44:51.870, Speaker B: In fact, under current copyright law, none of these works will enter the public domain until 2052. So what do we do about this? What kind of potential policy reforms are there? Well, patent law is interesting because to a large extent, patent law is actually judge created law. Not so much legislators matter, but it's also judge created law. So all this stuff I was talking about, the extension of patents to business methods and so forth, all created by judges. And what the judges can create, the judges can also take back. And in fact, that has started to happen. I mentioned there was this creation of this Federal Circuit Court in 1982, special Court for Patents, which became very, very pro patent, an expanding patent in all the ways.
00:44:51.870 - 00:45:34.086, Speaker B: But more recently, the Supreme Court has started to smack them down, has started to say no. And the Supreme Court has been, no, you can't patent jeans, you can't patent this, can't patent all. They've been pulling back in a wide variety of areas. You can interpret patents in a lot of different ways. You can interpret them narrowly or broadly. Okay? Judges can do that. Ramping up the novelty, non obvious requirements, ramping up the enablement requirement.
00:45:34.086 - 00:46:16.902, Speaker B: So there are a lot of things which the courts have begun to do, particularly the Supreme Court, to kind of pull patents back, which I think has generally been positive. There's also a question of, like, more fundamental reforms, which I've written about. It seems very peculiar, actually. Why does every innovation get a 20 year patent? Remember, the argument for patents is when your innovation costs are much higher than your imitation costs. So, like, pharmaceuticals are the classic example. Your first pill costs a billion dollars. Your second pill costs $0.50,
00:46:16.902 - 00:47:12.166, Speaker B: right? So that's a classic case where you want patents, but when your innovation costs are much closer to your imitation costs, like software, for example, then there's much less of an argument for patents. So why 20 years for everything? Okay, how about creating a patent system which is more responsive to your innovation versus your imitation costs? You could either literally require people to show some receipts for their R and D costs, or if that's too complicated, let's make some divisions by type of industry. And maybe we should have like a three year patent. Ten year patent. A 20 year patent. Okay. If you want a 20 year patent, you better show I got really high R and D costs, something of that nature.
00:47:12.166 - 00:47:18.990, Speaker B: Or as I say, you could do it by broad class. That's one big possible reform.
00:47:22.450 - 00:47:24.286, Speaker D: How do you calibrate those numbers?
00:47:24.468 - 00:48:02.940, Speaker B: Yeah. So first of all, we already require, for the investment tax credit, we already require people to show their receipts for investment. So I don't think it's impossible to have the same thing for R and D. Second, if we're going to have like a three, a ten and 20 year, you really only need sort of crude classifications. And you could make it yeah, you could make it partly created with a participation constraint. Right. So if you want a three year patent, you get it very quickly.
00:48:02.940 - 00:48:13.150, Speaker B: You want a ten, not so bad. You want a 20. Then we require kind of more from you. So I think on that kind of level, you could do it pretty reasonably.
00:48:14.290 - 00:48:15.182, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:48:15.236 - 00:48:15.840, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:48:17.430 - 00:48:21.374, Speaker C: We already have two kinds of patents, at least, right. With design and utility patents.
00:48:21.422 - 00:48:45.000, Speaker B: Correct? Exactly. That's right. So I'm talking about changing what we currently think about of the design patterns. Exactly. Yeah. A final type of intellectual property is actually intellect property. Right.
00:48:45.000 - 00:49:23.410, Speaker B: Which is, you may be familiar, some of you may have had to sign some of these, like, non competes. Okay. So a non compete agreement is when an employee agrees that if they terminate their employment, either they leave or they're fired either one, then they agree they're not going to go work for a competitor for maybe two or three years. That's a non compete agreement. And that's a type of intellectual property. It's like when ideas are in heads. So it's a way of controlling the heads.
00:49:23.410 - 00:49:56.494, Speaker B: Right. If you can't keep the ideas with a trade secret or patent, you try and keep the ideas by controlling the heads. And these non compete agreements, biden is arguing we should get rid of them. Okay. Which I think is a plausible argument, and they have gone up by a lot as well. So 18%, astounding really of the US workforce is governed by a non compete. Seems very, very high.
00:49:56.494 - 00:50:42.746, Speaker B: Like, the base case for them is like, if you have a trade secret or you have a customer list, you can sort of understand why you might want to non compete. But 18% of the US. Workforce seems very high, and that includes 15% of workers without a college degree. And it's quite plausible. And there is some evidence for this, that these non competes also reduce the diffusion of ideas. So one way in which ideas diffuse is by people moving from firm to firm. And that, in fact, is part of what made California's Silicon Valley so successful, is that California does not enforce non competes.
00:50:42.746 - 00:51:31.214, Speaker B: So when workers move from firm to firm, they take their ideas with them, and you get this diffusion of ideas. I think here there may also be a kind of prisoner's dilemma of IP, which applies to non competes but applies to IP more generally. And that is, any firm, of course, is going to want to say, yeah, we want non competes. Okay. But when a firm comes to hire workers, it then finds it can't hire them because other firms have got non competes. So what's good for the firm may not be good for the industry. You need to look on both sides like, every firm is going to want non competes, but that makes their hiring more difficult as well.
00:51:31.214 - 00:51:57.382, Speaker B: So perhaps getting rid of them might be a good idea. Okay. All right. Yes. So let me summarize or let me conclude, and that is that a lot of what IP is by no means all, but a lot of what you think about it, it's all about sort of dividing the pie. Right. Okay.
00:51:57.382 - 00:52:28.690, Speaker B: And the problem with dividing the pie is that when a lot of resources go into dividing the pie, you spend a lot of money on the lawyers and so forth. And all of these laws about who gets what share a lot of resources go into dividing the pie. Then the pie actually gets smaller. Now IP is actually in the US. Constitution, right? It was put into the US. Constitution. Why? To promote the progress of science and the useful arts.
00:52:28.690 - 00:53:08.800, Speaker B: And it makes sense that over time, sort of, IP has gotten a lot stronger because the only people who pay attention are the beneficiaries, the rent seekers, the firms, Disney's and so forth, who want stronger and stronger IP laws. Right. But I think it's incumbent upon the public to every now and then take a relook to revisit this question and ask whether IP is still continuing to promote the progress of science and the useful arts, or whether we need to take a second look. Thanks very much.
00:53:09.650 - 00:53:18.274, Speaker A: I wonder if you could comment on all the kind of debate around regulation of large language models and how that sort of fits into what you've said today.
00:53:18.392 - 00:53:58.270, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. So there's a whole bunch of different questions, one of which sort of goes well beyond IP right. Is the doomer scenarios. Right. The people who are worried about artificial intelligence taking over the world and becoming more intelligent than us and sort of doing away with us, which has actually gotten a lot of much more play in Silicon Valley than you might imagine. It's kind of surprising, actually.
00:53:58.270 - 00:54:58.266, Speaker B: And my view of that is that it's all so far, it's all theory, it's all rationalization. There's no empirical no empirical evidence for that as well. So I want to wait some time before we see whether the AIS are taken over in terms of now, IP, I guess the big issue is people are complaining, right, that Mid Journey has learnt about all of the art of the world and is then using that to create more art. And my view is, look, that's exactly what artists have been doing for centuries. That's what artists so, you know, Michelangelo doesn't arise in a vacuum. He looks at what the artists around him are doing and he modifies, he changes, he does something a little bit different. He builds upon those foundations.
00:54:58.266 - 00:56:17.814, Speaker B: And Mid journey is no different than Michelangelo. So I see absolutely no reason to grant IP to looking at artwork or to looking at these books or Internet materials which the large language models have been trained upon. That's no different than saying if you read a book, then the author gets a share of what you then use to produce using the knowledge you got from the book. That's crazy. The large language models, they're not databases, okay? They're not databases. So they are learning from past materials, whether it's photographs or artworks or text, and then they're producing new original texts which have never before been seen in the history of the world, right? So you can go and ask Chad GPT, create a rap about Fred Flintstone and create a Shakespearean sonnet about Fred Flintstone, and it will do it, okay? And that's totally original. It's creative.
00:56:17.814 - 00:56:27.710, Speaker B: It's using material from other sources, but in just the same way that every artist has always done. So I don't see any reason for regulating on those grounds.
00:56:28.930 - 00:57:03.500, Speaker C: Joe I guess to follow up on Tim's, there's this question because I believe you can't copyright the output of a machine. There has to be human creativity. So do you have an opinion on what level of involvement the human needs to have had in the creative process? When it becomes, like, if you just say, Fred Flintstone rap and push a button, have you sufficiently contributed to the creative process for it to be copyrightable? So forget about who influenced you, but if you want to copyright the output right?
00:57:04.510 - 00:57:39.560, Speaker B: That's a good question, and I don't have a well thought out answer on that. So the way it is now, like, Mid Journey has some copyright, but they give a very broad license. I think that's something which we're just going to have to figure out. It's a pretty new technology. So, yeah, I don't have a good answer on that. It's a good question.
00:57:41.210 - 00:57:45.686, Speaker C: I had a totally different question, too. You didn't mention trademark very much.
00:57:45.868 - 00:57:46.454, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:46.572 - 00:58:06.990, Speaker C: In your opinion, is trademark working the way it is? I've heard this fear that Disney and some of the others, when some of their early stuff is going out, that they're going to sort of shift to asserting trademark rights instead of copyright on characters like Mickey Mouse, where the copyright because trademark never expires, so they fall back to trademark.
00:58:07.970 - 00:59:17.602, Speaker B: So in general, I am much less worried about trademark because that still leaves open a huge amount of competition. Trademark is really about making sure that the consumer is getting what they think they're getting, right? Is this really Yves Saint Laurent bag? And so it's really I see trademark as much more consumer friendly in that it's not creating a monopoly so much as helping consumers to figure out what is real and what is fake. So I'm less worried about trademark. However, I think you raise a good point in that if Disney loses copyright, which eventually we don't know when, presumably eventually they will, maybe they would try and research it in other ways. Still, I think if the consumers are not being fooled, then there isn't a case for a trademark. So it's pretty obvious that A. W.
00:59:17.602 - 00:59:48.606, Speaker B: Milne, the author of Winnie the Pooh, was not the author of Blood and Honey. Okay. The movie I showed you earlier. Right. And so if it's obvious that this new version of Mickey Mouse or this new version of it's not, if it's distinguishable, then I don't see any reason for the trademark should intervene there. You should be able to use it with the trademark. Yeah.
00:59:48.708 - 01:00:13.730, Speaker C: So this graph about the decline of productivity, is there any empirical evidence that's tied to the rise of this rent seeking behavior? And if so, what prompts the rise of this rent seeking behavior? Because in my mind, laws typically follow some other general trend in economic behavior. So why is there a shift towards more rent seeking behavior?
01:00:13.890 - 01:01:14.714, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So it's a big debate about what caused the great stagnation. One theory is that, in fact, there are actually a fewer ideas and that it's a scientific reduction, which, if you think about the number of fundamental new technologies in the post World War II era, or incoming around that time, it's a lot of them. Right. And like the jet aircraft, for example, been no improvement in the real almost no improvement in jet aircraft since the 1955, something like that. And is that more about the technology itself or is it about regulation, like banning SuperSonics? A little bit hard to say. I think there is some evidence that part of it is due to these forces which I've been talking about.
01:01:14.714 - 01:02:15.098, Speaker B: It's very difficult to correlate this general decline with these individual forces. But if you look at that diffusion, for example, so in industries where there's this greater diffusion, you actually see slower aggregate productivity growth as well. So on an industry level, there is a connection between this slower diffusion of ideas and slower aggregate productivity growth. But again, it would be too much to ascribe all of this to describe all of that decrease in productivity to these forces as to what is creating this. I think rent seeking has always been around, but part of it is on a big level. It's maybe regulation part of it more risk aversion and so forth. And maybe part of it is that it's becoming harder to come up with new ideas.
01:02:15.098 - 01:02:51.540, Speaker B: There's actually some evidence for that in. We all know Moore's Law, right? Which is holding pretty well even today. But if you look at the number of engineers the number of electrical engineers sort of needed to keep Moore's Law going that has been going up and up and up exponentially. So in order to keep Moore's Law at the same pace we've had to put more and more resources into this. So it's a combination of these things and it's hard to say which is the most important. Okay, thank you very much.
