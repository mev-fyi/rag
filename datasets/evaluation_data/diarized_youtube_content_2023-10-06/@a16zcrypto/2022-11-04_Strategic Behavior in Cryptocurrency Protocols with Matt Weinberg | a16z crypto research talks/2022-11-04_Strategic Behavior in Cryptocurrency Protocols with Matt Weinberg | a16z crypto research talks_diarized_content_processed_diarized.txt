00:00:09.140 - 00:00:16.600, Speaker A: All right, so welcome, everyone. Today we have Matt Weingberg from Princeton telling us about selfish planet.
00:00:16.940 - 00:00:53.670, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks. So let me start by just taking one bit of COVID in this talk. So the first half, I don't know how many people here were at the talk I gave last week, but first they it is going to be disjoint. So what I want to talk about first are just incentive challenges that arise when mining incentives vary or mining rewards vary. So what I'll do first is we'll discuss kind of like why that might happen. And I'll actually pause in case people have questions or just want to contribute to that part of the talk.
00:00:53.670 - 00:01:41.860, Speaker B: Then I'll just go into some examples of what can go wrong. And I'm going to postpone the formal model till the second part. The second part is going to follow up on the talk I gave last week on selfish mining. I will give a very quick recap of the relevant stuff from last week, but it is definitely to build on that. And what I'm going to focus on are just like all these other models besides the core bitcoin model and all the different ways in which strategic mining facilitates. So let me dive into what happens when I mine a warrior. So like I said, I am going to pause on this live in case people want to either ask questions or contribute their own example of why this might arise.
00:01:41.860 - 00:02:11.884, Speaker B: Okay, so in classic bitcoin, right, so bitcoin is not a complete cryptocurrency. So that means that the way that miners get rewards, they get rewards only from the transaction fees or the block rewards. And the classic bitcoin, that when the work I did was happening, the transaction fees were also very normal. So kind of like the classic model is you have this block reward. Now it's 6.25 bitcoin. You get 6.25
00:02:11.884 - 00:03:19.620, Speaker B: bitcoin when you create a block. And what we want to look at is what happens if different blocks are worth different amounts for whatever reason. So, for example, maybe some block is worth one, some block is worth ten. And the main conclusion that I'm going to the main conclusion that I want to draw in this part of the talk is that strategic mining is way more of a problem when the block rewards vary. So right now I'm just going to give some examples of that. But first I will just kind of quickly discuss why do mining rewards vary? So I'm aware of two main driving reasons, which is just the ones I put up on the slide. One is just that the intent, even for protocols like bitcoin, the intent is eventually there is not going to be a block reward, right? And maybe the next time the block reward has, maybe the transaction fees will finally start dominating the block rewards.
00:03:19.620 - 00:04:23.220, Speaker B: And then just by nature of the mem pool looks different at different points in time. And so the set of available transactions is going to be different at different points in time when you create a block, depending on what the Mempool looks like, it's going to be worth different amounts. So that's one reason why the block rewards might vary. And this was the original motivation for this work. All right, so ink at this. Okay, so the another reason that might happen now so I learned the terminology of a motivation a little bit more precisely from Tim recently. But on Ethereum or any other turn, complete cryptocurrency, just by the nature of the transactions, there's all this interaction with various smart contracts and who knows what's going to happen with that? It could be that based on who includes those transactions in their block, that's going to trigger something in a smart contract.
00:04:23.220 - 00:05:17.396, Speaker B: And if you're the miner who notices that and you're the one who can access that money, then maybe you get some reward for that. So my understanding is the term that's used for this, it's minor extractable value. And it just refers to the concept that it could be because of the specific nature of the smart contracts and the transactions that you're including in your block, there is some value that you as the first person who noticed that or you as the person who controls the contents of the block can get for yourself. And this is outside the official transaction fee mechanism. So maybe before going on, I will quickly pause here in case there are either questions about this motivation or in case someone else wanted to add another reason. And I'll just pause for a second just in case and otherwise I will now move on. Okay, so hopefully that is convincing.
00:05:17.508 - 00:05:31.372, Speaker A: So I guess I'm just to clarify. So one thing that could be happening is that the block reward is changing. That would be like the Bitcoin story, the transaction fees, who knows what they're doing. Another one would be that the block reward is fixed. The transaction fees maybe grow a lot over time.
00:05:31.426 - 00:05:32.172, Speaker B: That's also true.
00:05:32.226 - 00:05:36.588, Speaker A: Both of those cases in a different regime than we've been in historically.
00:05:36.764 - 00:06:10.744, Speaker B: That's correct. Yeah. Sorry, let me just repeat what I understood to be saying is one thing that could change as it does in Bitcoin is the block reward is having getting lower over time. So by that happening, the block reward is getting smaller. Even if the transaction fees don't change, they're just going to become the main source of revenue for miners. And separately, it could just be that the transaction fees go up for some reason due to high demand. The transaction fees themselves just naturally change over time.
00:06:10.744 - 00:07:43.656, Speaker B: That once you start having reward coming from transaction fees, there's no reason to expect that every time a block is created, the mempool has exactly the same set of transaction fees in it all the time that you should expect it to change. Something in the chat okay, that's a really good question. So I guess, I sorry, the question is, is MEB only meant to mean incidental sources of additional revenue? Does it include intentional arbits? So I don't know, Tim, if you want to give an answer after me, but I guess I was imagining the interesting distinction being between something that every person can obviously recognize as like this is intended part of the protocol. This person clearly intended to pay any person who creates this block. I would count that in the transaction fees, whether it was like a bribe or at that point I would say why not just include it as a transaction fee for the mev? I was imagining anything that's not kind of like anything that fails to have that property where it's sort of like, it's part of the protocol. Everyone accepts that you're supposed to pay some fees to be included in the block. Any miner will easily recognize that or any onlooker will easily recognize that this is part of that.
00:07:43.656 - 00:08:21.700, Speaker B: So I guess that's maybe the distinction I had in mind. I don't know if that was the same. Okay. The question was mev could also target specific miners. I would also include that. I guess maybe the thing that I would want to happen is that whether or not you can collect that MOV should depend on sort of like the set of transactions somehow. It shouldn't be that there's this transaction out there that you can collect no matter when you find it.
00:08:21.700 - 00:08:47.790, Speaker B: It's just someone's paying like out of a pay is not really related to me. You don't need to be strategic about that. You'll just get that when you get it. I'm imagining something like it could be specific to a miner, but it should somehow depend on like they need to put the transactions together in a certain way. They need to mine this block now instead of later. They need to mine it, point to this instead of that, something like that. Good.
00:08:47.790 - 00:09:25.060, Speaker B: Thanks Joe, for the question. Okay, so now I will move on. Okay. So what I am going to do, just to show you kind of like what the context was like six years ago when I was working on this, I just decided to copy the slides I had at the time. So the motivation for this, right, is that at the time the current state of bitcoin was this is even before the most recent habit. So this was twelve and a half bitcoin. That was the block reward.
00:09:25.060 - 00:10:20.108, Speaker B: And maybe there's a little bit of variance in the transaction fees, but they were pretty nominal. And so you really get pretty close to twelve and a half every block you created. And then what is supposed to happen eventually is the block reward will get all the way down to zero. And what that means is that now the transaction fees, if it differs from block to block, instead of just being changing 1% or 2% of the revenue you get now it's changing a very significant fraction of the revenue that you're getting. So at the time there was this huge debate about what block size Bitcoin wanted to use. And part of that debate like one of the motivating factors for that debate was like, well, the block size needs to be somewhat small in order to make sure that people have to pay something in order to be in the block. And so that was like a very passionate discussion at the time.
00:10:20.108 - 00:11:16.424, Speaker B: And what was not at all discussed at the time was like, well, let's say that we get the transaction fees to rise and be stable. So maybe I really believe that there's going to be a steady stream of people who are willing to pay the right amount of fees over time. And I really believe that in expectation, every block is going to be worth twelve and a half. I really believe that the miners are comfortable maximizing their expected rewards. The general sense of the community was that this really was not a big deal and there is some possible justification for that, which is like it is true that if the miners are using the same strategy and then I tell you, in one model you're being paid twelve and a half deterministically every block. In another model, I tell you you're being paid twelve and a half in expectation that there's a variance. The miners are risk neutral.
00:11:16.424 - 00:12:06.172, Speaker B: They really don't care. Right? Similarly, the whole point is this is going to happen over a very long period and just like due to the law of large numbers, they'll basically get the same thing anyway, right? So if they use the same strategies, there's really no difference. And the okay, but kind of like the main point is that there's no reason you should expect these are two different games. There's no reason you should expect people to use exactly the same strategy. And the biggest takeaway is this bullet at the bottom, which is that now you can use strategies that are different depending on the fees that are included in a block. So I'll elaborate on the next couple of slides. All these different ways in which you can do this, but there's lots of different ways that you can do this.
00:12:06.172 - 00:12:43.560, Speaker B: There's lots of richer stuff you can do. Basically the point is that it's really different than when the reward is just fixed. So I see that there's something in the chat, I'm just going to try and quickly read that. Okay? I think what's in the discussion is a little sophisticated enough that I need a minute or two to process it. So let me get back to that. Maybe at the next discussion for us, but I will definitely get back to that. Okay, so let me give you now some of these examples.
00:12:43.560 - 00:13:24.820, Speaker B: Okay? So remember that the basic longest chain protocol says whenever you're trying to build a block, please point to the furthest. Please point to the longest chain. And there's this default tiebreaking rule which says please just break ties in favor of the first chain that you've heard about. You should always broadcast it, right? For example, if you were to find yourself in this situation, let me just quickly explain the picture. In the picture, this means that this block has seven transactions, seven whatevers, of transaction fees in it. This has 15, this has ten. And this means in the mempool, there's five fees worth of transactions left.
00:13:24.820 - 00:13:47.310, Speaker B: And here there's ten. Because there's five fewer included here than in here. And if you heard about the block on the top before the block on the bottom, this tiebreaking rule asks you to create this block. It says you can include all these fees, that's fine. But you're supposed to point to this block. The maximum fees you can include is five. That's all that's there.
00:13:47.310 - 00:14:22.760, Speaker B: Instead, I think a pretty, I don't know, somewhat reasonable thing to think that people might do is say, well, no one can really verify what's the first node you heard about. And maybe instead what you should do is you should just tiebreak in favor of the one that lets you build the big slot of your own. Right. This tiebreaking thing is not even really considered part of the core of bitcoin protocol. It's like a suggestion that people should do. So you're not even really violating the protocol. You're just tie breaking.
00:14:22.760 - 00:14:53.916, Speaker B: And that alone is not a huge problem. Right. They say fine, you're still going to have consensus pies happen on their own incidentally. Fine. I mean, pie broken in different ways, fine. The problem is you have to think the next level, right. Which is what if you know that the other miners are going to tiebreak in this way, right? So now if you happen to be in this situation where there's not yet been created, this block down here, so everything is good, there's a single longest chain.
00:14:53.916 - 00:15:38.016, Speaker B: What you're supposed to do is you're supposed to build on top of the unique longest chain and you're going to get it most five when you do that. Instead, what you can do is you can build a block worth ten on top of seven. So this is a real violation of the longest chain protocol. Right? You're not building on top of the longest chain. And why would you do that? Well, if the next miner is going to use this petty tiebreaking, which we just said we didn't consider on its own to be a huge deal, and they're also going to get more money by doing it, then now they're going to build on top of your block. And so you're going to get ten if that happens, of course.
00:15:38.198 - 00:15:40.188, Speaker A: Make sure I understand the picture.
00:15:40.284 - 00:15:40.930, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:41.300 - 00:15:48.508, Speaker A: I should think of there being basically like after the seven block. I should think of like the total mem pool had like 20 transactions.
00:15:48.524 - 00:15:49.090, Speaker B: Correct.
00:15:49.800 - 00:15:59.832, Speaker A: That 15 is some minor taking 15 of the 20 out of the block was five left. And then B is like this parallel universe where the 15 block hasn't happened.
00:15:59.886 - 00:16:00.200, Speaker B: Correct.
00:16:00.270 - 00:16:05.336, Speaker A: And now you're saying if you include less than 15 of that, you're going to send it.
00:16:05.518 - 00:16:40.550, Speaker B: Correct. Let me just repeat. I don't know if everything the audience is audible, but just to repeat, the idea is that at this point in time, the idea is that after the seven block, there are 20 bitcoin worth of transactions in the mempool. When this 15 block gets created, that consumes 15 of the 15 worth of fees of what's in the mempool. And if you continue on this chain, there's five left. If instead you tried to fork to a fork where this 15 didn't exist, there's still the full 20 left.
00:16:42.680 - 00:16:46.816, Speaker A: The simplest thing would be literally just copy the 15 block, but it made a single transaction.
00:16:46.848 - 00:17:14.604, Speaker B: Correct. Yeah. So something else you could do is rather than ten, you could do like 14.99 or whatever, you could just take out the least valuable transaction and then the petty tiebreaker, if they're really petty and they would change the tiebreaking for the 0.1, they would still point on top of you. Okay. So at this point, just to be clear, I'm personally not, like a doom and gloom predictor.
00:17:14.604 - 00:17:56.348, Speaker B: And I'm not saying I think this is absolutely what's going to happen in any system with transaction fees, but I definitely think it's a serious concern, right, that if you ask me to guess whether miners will tiebreak will do this petty tiebreaking, I really would say kind of like, why not? They're just going to get more money when they do that. And definitely if they're the only ones doing it, it's not a big deal. They're definitely going to do it. And then, of course, the problem is if everyone does it, then you allow for the possibility of really bad actors to try and get more money. By this way, Matt, I guess the.
00:17:56.354 - 00:18:21.060, Speaker C: Question for me is more I agree with you that in a scenario like this, it seems quite clear that people would do this petty tiebreaking. I guess the question is more how big the variance really is. It's like this 20 to five situation in mempool difference is that just oh, I guess that just came because of the 15 block.
00:18:22.200 - 00:18:22.950, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:24.920 - 00:18:36.452, Speaker C: Is this realistic or do we assume mem pools are those things and blocks are always full and we get to some equilibrium of transaction fees?
00:18:36.596 - 00:20:09.770, Speaker B: That's a great question. I would interpret the main point of the question is, is there actually variance in practice in the most valuable block you can create from the steady SAFEM pool? So that I don't know the answer to for bitcoin, that would be like a change. That would be like a change specific question. So the most important thing though, is that clearly for that to possibly be true, you definitely need to have the block size be constraining, right? Like if the block size is not constraining, and for the most part, most people who want to be included can be included, then the mem pool is going to kind of fill up and drain, fill up and drain, fill up and drain, right? And if that is happening, there is definitely going to be variance. And for this, you don't even need a lot of variance. You just need it to be like, let's say that the mempool is filling up and then it drains with every block. Then as long as it filled up by the previous block was ten and it filled up until nine before I found the next one, then I would want to do this attack, right? I think that the main question behind that is sort of like is the total fees in the mempool really completely static over time for the maximum value block you could create or is there any variance in that? If there's any variance in that, then you can do this attack.
00:20:09.770 - 00:20:50.964, Speaker B: Did that answer the question? Cool. There's another one in Chat. I'll just repeat what Joe was saying. As far as he knows, there's no large bitcoin miners that will replace that will take replaced by fee transaction, which is even smaller variation than the petty launch chain. So he's just saying that perhaps the profit is just too small today to go against convention and switch. I think that's totally possible. And then I just want to be clear again that I'm not an empiricist, that I'm not trying to claim that anything is happening or absolutely should happen.
00:20:50.964 - 00:21:51.220, Speaker B: I think I'm more like trying to present I would phrase it like causes for concern or things that could happen or trying to introduce concepts or possibilities. But I still think that it's good to stop and pause and talk about what is the actual implication for practice and what is going on. I'm not the source of that knowledge that I'm learning that I think everyone needs. Okay, so the next kind of simple thing you might imagine, right, is all this like deep sniping different than other for whatever reason. So maybe there's like this huge MEP opportunity or for some reason someone includes a huge transaction fee for one transaction. There's some transaction in the mem pool that's just worth like 1000 bitcoins or some small set of transactions or something like that, right? And that happens to be valuable for whatever. Miner includes that in their block.
00:21:51.220 - 00:22:36.580, Speaker B: And let's say the sum minor, not you, is the next minor and they include that transaction in their block. And let's say you have significantly less than 50% of the total hash rate, right? Say you have like 10%. Then if there was just a block reward, right? So this thousand T transaction doesn't exist. Everything's just based on the block reward, then you would maximize your reward by just continuing to mine on top of their block, right? Like your mining power is 10%. You're not going to be able to successfully mine something and override theirs. This is below the range where selfish mining is profitable. You should just be following the longest chain.
00:22:36.580 - 00:23:40.696, Speaker B: But now with only your 10% of the hash rate, you can still go through and say like, well, if I find the next block, it's possible that I'll get lucky and find the one immediately after that. That's really unlikely, which is why I don't want to do something like selfish mining. But like, man, if I succeed, I'm going to seal this 1000 bitcoin transaction. So even though you're very unlikely to succeed, you have a 10% chance you actually still want to do that. And the way the numbers worked out for this example, even if you're two blocks behind, you'd have a 1% chance of catching the gut. You would actually still want to do that in that case, right? The last goal is just working out the numbers that you significantly increase your expected reward by trying to undercut even though you're not likely to succeed because of this huge anomalous transaction. Okay, so I'm going to wrap up this first part of the talk.
00:23:40.696 - 00:24:28.276, Speaker B: So I have a talk for discussion slide coming immediately after this in case people wanted to revisit some of the applications of practice that came up earlier. We're discussing new ones. But just to summarize, right, so prior to this work, there really was not a whole lot of concern at all in the community about the distinction between getting deterministic block awards or block rewards and expectation. And the main point, so I didn't touch on the selfish mining stuff yet. I'm going to mention that when I get to the selfish mining half of the talk, but I did show you talking about this undercutting. And you can also imagine if miners think that other miners are going to try and undercut them, they may intentionally leave out transactions. So they don't want to be undercut.
00:24:28.276 - 00:25:15.880, Speaker B: So they want to make sure that they leave enough stuff that the next miner prefers to mine on top of them instead of trying undercut. Then I mentioned the speed piping. And the intuition is just that there's this way richer strategy space that previously it didn't make sense to have a strategy that depended on the contents of the block because you were getting 6.25 no matter what. Now you can have really rich strategies that depend on the contents of the block. So the slightly more refined intuition, right, that what we saw is that you may want to chase an unusually high value transaction or just like chase high fees that happen to be sitting in the mem pool. And then what we will see in the selfish mining is that it may make sense for you to just kind of waste an unusually low value block to just kind of throw it away to selfish mining and maybe you get lucky.
00:25:15.880 - 00:25:58.490, Speaker B: So that's kind of like the intuition, is it? High value blocks, you might want to chase them when otherwise you would have just been whatever. And low value blocks, you may want to intentionally strategize with them because if you happen to fail them, whatever. Okay, so I don't know if anyone wanted to discuss kind of like the practical relevance or anything like that or variance of this now, but if someone would like to initiate a discussion, we can do that. If no one would like to do that, I'll jump to the second part of the talk. I'll sit here for, I don't know, 30 seconds or so just in case someone has something.
00:26:02.460 - 00:26:10.890, Speaker C: Has there been any automated tooling to detect these scenarios in large chains? Because it seems like it's fairly easy to detect this in an automated way.
00:26:13.980 - 00:26:46.550, Speaker B: So that's a good question. So I don't know if Joe's the right person to ask if Joe if you're aware of anything. Like so my background is purely theoretical and I don't know myself a lot of the empirical details. I'm hoping that maybe Joe or someone else in the audience might know whether that's been done. Let me add, Daniel, I don't know if you want to elaborate on the comment on voice or more in chat. I think I follow what you're ahead.
00:26:47.320 - 00:27:10.860, Speaker D: Yeah, I was just thinking, like, at least with Classic, like, you have this huge incentive to go to one side of the chain that's kind of outside the protocol. And it seems like an extreme example of this mev where people kind of, like, split into two different forks. More of a social mev.
00:27:12.100 - 00:27:54.796, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. So just to repeat my own understanding is that because there was this huge, like, the whole east versus East Classic discussion was over essentially this one big transaction or small collection of transactions that had huge value for the person who launched the attack. So I agree that certainly everyone involved in that attack because the benefit clearly has high incentive for going to Classic sorry, I forget which name got the split, but I think the attacker still.
00:27:54.818 - 00:27:56.184, Speaker A: Has the money on ETH Classic.
00:27:56.232 - 00:28:38.564, Speaker B: Okay, got it. But I think a lot of the I don't know if other people have other thoughts, but I feel like a lot of the discussion around ETH versus ETH classic, what other miners were interested in was not so much. That they were personally going to get rewarded on e versus ETH. Classic, but more of like a philosophy as to which version of ethereum has more value. It is a version of Ethereum where code is law. And this transaction, even though most people recognize it as a bug, it happened. So it happened.
00:28:38.564 - 00:28:45.820, Speaker B: Or is it a version where there is a possibility for some human intervention in extreme circumstances.
00:28:46.160 - 00:29:03.900, Speaker D: Yeah, I was thinking of that kind of as like speculative mev. Like the bitcoin like bitcoin cash is not necessarily like there wasn't one transaction that people was very valuable, but maybe miners were speculating. Oh, I'm going on this chain because.
00:29:04.070 - 00:29:06.390, Speaker B: Interesting, yeah.
00:29:08.600 - 00:29:10.070, Speaker D: This one will win out.
00:29:10.920 - 00:29:40.060, Speaker B: That makes sense. I think that style of MEB is probably less related to these specific kinds of attacks. Right. Because I feel like, for example, it's not like I can undercut your block and cause a social and that's going to be what causes the social shift from code is law to intervention.
00:29:40.640 - 00:29:47.810, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. There are definitely more clear cut cases but it seems somewhat like a spectrum as well.
00:29:48.660 - 00:30:32.008, Speaker B: I think that's a good point. So maybe what I should refine about what I said earlier is sort of like I guess mev is a large enough term that it captures things that are kind of, like, not particularly related to what I was saying. And that there's this specific kind of mev that has this property where sort of like it's directly related to the specific miner who includes that in their blog. Yeah, I just have to maybe think if there's a way to formalize that or state that more clearly. But I agree with that, that there's different kinds of mev that are more or less related. All right, cool. Thanks for all the discussion.
00:30:32.008 - 00:30:59.210, Speaker B: So I think now I'm going to go on to the second half of the talk. So this is going to be a little bit of a contact switch to have like a mental reset. So it's going to be a contact switch. I'm now going to go so the technical stuff now is going to be related to selfish Miami. So there's going to be an actual formal model. If you were here last week, it's going to be similar to that from last week. I'm going to quickly recap that.
00:30:59.210 - 00:31:44.036, Speaker B: I'm going to dive into that now that I've mentally insighted. Okay, so quick reminder of the motivation for thinking of things like selfish mining is that you cannot successfully attack Bitcoin or Ethereum by forging transactions by retroactively changing contents of blocks. And that's because cryptography solves all of these problems. However, there are some problems that inherently have nothing to do with cryptography. Such as no amount of cryptography can force you to point to the longest chain. No amount of cryptography can force you to broadcast your blogs the moment you create them. These inherently are mechanism design questions.
00:31:44.036 - 00:32:24.236, Speaker B: You have to ask what are people incentivized? And I will quickly remind you that I'll quickly remind you of what the game looked like last week and then basically what's going to happen in the rest of this talk is going to be like tweaks to this game and I'm going to be more or less rigorous with the tweaks for different. So as a reminder, we said the. Setup is that every miner has some fraction of the total hash rate. Slowly, every minor has some fraction of the hash rate. At all points in time, every miner is aware of some current blockchain, right? So they're aware of some directed tree. There's a block. The pointer points to a different block.
00:32:24.236 - 00:33:02.220, Speaker B: They all share the same route. And what is the actual gain? So at every time step, a random miner is selected to mine a block proportional to their computational power. What does it mean to create a block? You create a node. You points to any other node that you've heard of and then you can broadcast anything you want. So again, there's no amount of cryptography that forces you to broadcast. And to simplify the model, we just said, what does broadcast mean? Broadcast means that everyone hears about it and everyone hears about it at the same time. So this is to let us really focus on the incentives and not to worry about network partitioning attacks and distributed systems.
00:33:02.220 - 00:33:55.600, Speaker B: Okay, and then what's the reward? The reward over time is just like, well, this game goes on for infinity. And then at any point in time, you can say, what's the longest chain? And you can ask, what's the fraction of blocks that you created on the longest chain. So your goal, what's written here is just a mathematically formal way of saying your goal is to maximize the fraction of blocks on the longest chain that were created by you. And last week, one of the things we talked about was, why was this the reward? And we said, this is because of the difficulty adjustment. It means that the rate of growth of the longest chain is proportional to time. So I don't want to rehash those parts, but I just wanted to quickly refresh that, see what we're building off of. And then what I stated last time was that in this game, there is a strategy that is better than following the longest chain protocol, even if you have less than 50% of the total hash rate.
00:33:55.600 - 00:34:25.668, Speaker B: It was a strategy that's now called selfish mining. I'm going to very quickly remind you with a picture of what that strategy looks like. So quick reminder of what that strategy looks like is if you find a block, you should hide that block. So red means that block has not been broadcast yet. You find the block, find another block, you keep it hidden. Find another block, you keep it hidden. When someone else finds a block that is the same height as yours, you should only then release your block.
00:34:25.668 - 00:34:57.796, Speaker B: And if someone finds another block that is the same height as yours and you only have one hidden block left, you should release it. And the reason you should do this is because now you are going to create a longest chain that everyone else is going to point to. You have successfully kicked out two other blocks from the longest chain. So that means that your three blocks, that if you were honest, three of seven. In this picture, your three blocks are now three of five. And so you reward those from whatever three seven is to 60%. So that's why the attack can be good.
00:34:57.796 - 00:36:10.824, Speaker B: Why the attack can be bad is maybe you hide your block and then someone else finds a block and then someone else finds a block again. So in this case, if you were honest, you would have gotten one in four. But because you were doing selfish mining, you now get zero of three because your block was kicked out. And so the whole point of this attack, there's some mathematical analysis you have to do, and it turns out that the reward outweighs the risk whenever you have at least a third of this little mining model. Okay, so all of this is just a quick recap to remind us of the model and what happened last week. One thing that I did not get to say last week is I just maybe I didn't say last week, but I'll quickly repeat is that one way in which this model can be generalized is you can say, like, well, initially we said that the attacker was super well connected and that they have this property. That whenever someone hears about an attacker block and someone else's block that everyone hybrates in favor of the attacker block because they heard about it first.
00:36:10.824 - 00:37:32.368, Speaker B: And then we said, well, what if the attacker is super poorly connected? That was a model that we considered the real one with the real results. And in that model where everyone tiebreaks against the attacker because they heard about this honest block before the attacker block, that was where all the analysis we did was. And all of that can be really easily extended to what if you win a gamma fraction of the ties, right? What if you're kind of well connected in the network? It happens to be that this parameter abstracts away exactly who you're well connected to and exactly how well connected you are to different people. It's just that the only thing that really matters for the analysis is what's the probability that if I take a random miner who's not you that they happen to have heard about your blog first instead of someone else's? And whatever this number is, I'm not going to maybe read through this, but it's very easy to adapt the analysis I showed you last time of one change for the calculations and that's it. Now, what I want to do, but this part I think we didn't get to last time is to, again, pause for a quick discussion on what's actually happened in practice. So again, I'm not the empiricist, but I have been to talks by empiricists and I've heard a little bit of what they say. So first question I think a lot of people ask is selfish mining ever been detected.
00:37:32.368 - 00:38:48.780, Speaker B: And the answer that I heard during all the talks was it has never been detected on bitcoin or a substantial cryptocurrency. My understanding from things I heard during talks was that they have detected it on small random altcoins, where I guess the implication was to detect all sorts of things on small random altcoins, but it has been detected somewhere. And there are statistical detection methods, right? So it's very hard to pick a specific account and say this account is definitely selfish mining because people can spread their money across multiple different accounts. But there are statistical detection methods where you can say someone in the network is probably selfish mining right now. So, for example, if you happen to see this situation where for some reason there was this chain of three overcoming a chain of two, that's not likely if no one is selfish minded because you would not expect there to be kind of like two ties in a row. And you would not expect someone to immediately find a block the moment that the second time happens. So you can statistically detect that someone is probably selfish mining.
00:38:48.780 - 00:39:49.072, Speaker B: And so questions I think that people should ask is, why is selfish mining not happening on bitcoin ethereum or stuff right now? And I think there are good answers. The reason I think it's good to know the answer is that everything is changing really fast and it's good to know kind of like, when might you expect selfish mining to become a problem, if at all? So one possible reason is just that in order for this to be profitable, you need 33% of the total hash power in the network. And that's a lot of hash power. There must be like some relatively large altcoins at points in time in bitcoin's history where there were people who had enough mining power to theoretically do selfish mining. And it would have worked, but it didn't happen. Another reason that I've heard is that in order to actually do this attack, you need to actually change elements of Bitcoin source code. Like, you need to go in and write your own rules for which block you're going to mine on top of.
00:39:49.072 - 00:41:04.520, Speaker B: And if you want to do that, there's always a chance when you do programming in whatever language it is you're supposed to do your programming, you might introduce a bug. And bugs are very costly when literally if you start producing invalid blocks for whatever reason, then no one's going to mine on top of your block, and as soon as that starts happening, you're just wasting whatever your mining power is. So I don't know, I'm not in touch enough with miners to know to what extent this is a serious concern, but that's something that had been posed in a previous talk I gave. The answer that I find most convincing is just that there are other impacts of selfish mining. So, for example, if you were to start selfish mining on bitcoin with 40% of the total hash rate, I think it would absolutely be statistically detected if it became public knowledge that it is very likely that somebody is selfish mining on bitcoin. I think it is likely that the exchange rate of bitcoin would tank a little bit and people would now want to pay less us. Dollars for bitcoin because there's concern that now someone has 40% of the hash rate and whoever that is, they are willing to selfish mine who knows what else they're willing to do.
00:41:04.520 - 00:42:12.124, Speaker B: And I personally find that argument very convincing. And so personally, if I happen to own 40% of the mining power for bitcoin, I would definitely think twice about doing that. But I would say one important thing about that kind of reasoning is that it at least forces I think you to acknowledge or accept that there is something going on outside of just the raw bitcoin source code that is very relevant to how Bitcoin operates, which is that you really are relying on something called an exchange rate, which has nothing to do with the Bitcoin source code. And that is the reason why your protocol achieves consensus or your protocol does not have something like selfish mining. Okay, so anyway, those are kind of like my thoughts. I don't know again if other people have thoughts that they wanted to share or questions any of these. To the extent that I'm offering my own opinion, I personally find the third one to be significantly more convincing than any of the others.
00:42:12.124 - 00:42:47.370, Speaker B: But I also think again, that it forces you to acknowledge that there is a lot going on besides just the raw code that determines what happens in the bitcoin game. And two, you can also imagine scenarios where this no longer holds, right? If for some reason it became possible to do to short bitcoin or something, you could imagine hedging against selfish mining by short selling or something like that, and the externalities could change for all sorts of reasons. So I think that if this is the main defense, which seems super reasonable to me, it just means that you have to keep thinking about how to maintain that, what would change that, stuff like that.
00:42:47.740 - 00:43:36.600, Speaker A: I would have maybe two things that don't actually need you to go outside of the protocol. So one is the difficulty adjustment. So this attack doesn't pay off until difficulty adjusts. So in bitcoin, for example, you'll have two weeks where, as you say, presumably people will detect it and the community has a two week window to decide how to respond before it adjusts. The other thing I'd say is you show that this is profitable assuming everybody else is doing honest mining, right? And so there's this two week period where sort of you knock things out of this pseudo equilibrium and now people are going to best respond to you, right? They're going to best respond to you by honest mining. So I don't think when you think about like fast forward to the equilibrium, it seems risky to assume you're going to get kind of higher profits than you were before even holding the price fixed.
00:43:38.880 - 00:44:18.580, Speaker B: Okay, that's a good point. I don't know if it's really pushback, but that still does not explain why honest mining is happening right now. Because basically theorem is that honest mining is not an equilibrium, but what we are currently seeing is honest mining. And so I think that does explain why we are not necessarily seeing specifically this selfish mining. Because it could be that once people respond in equilibrium, actually you would have been happier if you were honest and people were responding to honest.
00:44:18.650 - 00:44:35.900, Speaker A: It's conceivable, I'm not claiming this is true. It's conceivable that there was a theorem that would say honest mining is actually paradox superior to any national equilibrium or any symmetric natural equilibrium, let's say something like that. In which case it's actually this brilliant coordination where they're actually enforcing a non equilibrium.
00:44:36.640 - 00:44:37.516, Speaker B: I don't know if that's true.
00:44:37.538 - 00:44:43.532, Speaker A: The point is you can't possibly it's like the devil you know versus the devil you don't know.
00:44:43.586 - 00:44:59.008, Speaker B: That's possible. You're saying it could be that what's really going on is this is a repeated game. In a repeated game you can have non equilibria things that wouldn't be equilibria and steady state you can somehow have because everyone's worried that essentially but I.
00:44:59.014 - 00:45:08.570, Speaker A: Mean more I want to say, you can imagine saying be careful what you wish for. Do you really want to be in equilibrium? And if you don't, it doesn't work for everybody.
00:45:10.540 - 00:46:04.760, Speaker B: I think it might be hard to make that sorry, go ahead. I think Tim, it might be hard to make there are theorems of the form pareto optima dominates all equilibrium of a certain type. I think it might be hard to make precise in this situation. I think framing it as a repeated game may capture the effect you're describing a little bit more easily. Because what's the pareto optimum coming from? It's coming from the discounted future payoff flow somehow that sounds like a repeated game logic. So also I think just by the nature of if you don't have anything to do with the exchange rate in your reasoning, then the total pie is fixed independent of everyone's strategies. So if there is any equilibrium, besides if it's not honest splitting, if it's not proportional, someone has to be profiting.
00:46:05.980 - 00:46:12.076, Speaker A: That's a good point about the fixed size pie. But then doesn't that say that in any symmetric equilibrium you would have exactly the same payoff profile as you do.
00:46:12.098 - 00:46:31.772, Speaker B: Under honest mining if everyone had the same hash rate? I think that's right. But it doesn't explain why if there's a 40% minor and like 610 percent miners, it doesn't explain why the 40% minor is not getting more than 40% of the rewards.
00:46:31.836 - 00:46:36.336, Speaker A: But is it obvious that the 40% would do better than 40% at the eventually.
00:46:36.448 - 00:46:40.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. So I agree that that's not obvious.
00:46:41.320 - 00:47:05.736, Speaker C: Well, so there is the famous example. I mean, this is now a couple of years ago, but there was a mining pool, GHash IO that had over 50% of the mining power. And we know that then the dominant strategy, if you analyze it like this, is to double spend, even if I don't double spend, just to exclude all other blocks.
00:47:05.768 - 00:47:05.964, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:06.002 - 00:47:41.160, Speaker C: So to just make a monopoly out of this. And I think that really drives to the last point here, right, because then we can't well, either it has to be some repeated game analysis, but really, I think they were worried about the exchange rate. So what they did is they just shut down machines. They publicly said it was obviously very detectable or it was very detected. I mean, they could have split themselves, but they didn't do that. What they did is they basically told people to move away from their mining pool. So we know that this actually happened.
00:47:41.160 - 00:48:24.070, Speaker C: And I guess my question is, do you think that we have any chance of we're modeling the equilibrium now with rewards in Bitcoin? But I think what we're saying here is that that is not how the miners utility functions are defined. The miners utility functions are defined in dollars. So is there any chance, I mean, modeling the exchange rate is really difficult, but could we come up with models where we take the exchange rate into account and say, can we actually model this in dollars, not in bitcoin, and maybe then get some more? Not just see this as some sort of quirk, but actually model this in some way?
00:48:24.920 - 00:48:52.864, Speaker B: Yeah. So there are two things in Benedict's question. Let me respond to the actual question. First, I am not aware of prior work that tries to model the exchange rate, how it would react to something like selfish mining. I think that that is trackable. Right. For example, there is work where they.
00:48:52.902 - 00:48:59.920, Speaker A: Focus more on double spend attacks and they do explicitly model a possible drop in the exchange rate with a successful.
00:49:00.500 - 00:49:41.632, Speaker B: I haven't seen it in selfish mining. Yeah. And I can say for selfish mining, what I think would be different is for selfish mining, you only have statistical detection, right. So the only thing you have to go on is like, oh, every time you create a suspicious looking fork, I mean, that could happen on its own. Right. So you can't have a model that says when there's a suspicious looking fork, the exchange rate tanks all the way, right. So you need some model that says, like, well, based on the frequency of certain kinds of forks, this is how the exchange rate changes, or something like that.
00:49:41.632 - 00:51:13.908, Speaker B: I think that it should be tractable to formulate a model that says for some event that has some probability of occurring naturally but has now occurred and is indicative of selfish mining based on the unlikeliness that it would occur naturally. You have some smooth impact on the exchange rate and then you can try to solve the same. I don't know that it would be like mathematically easy, but at least a well formulated mathematical problem. I think that should be tractable for something like that to happen. The other thing I would say, though, is that I would still say in response to that, right? So let's say that I had 40% of the total hash rate, right? What if I decided, I don't know, 1 hour a week I'm going to selfish Mine, and the other however many hours that is, I'm not going to selfish Mine? Then I feel like there is a low enough selfish mining that the detection is really not going to be there because the forks that happen naturally will just happen anyway, and that would still get some profit. Right. I guess the flip side is that the reason that I might consider doing that is exactly because it would not be detected by anyone who's looking to see if selfish mining is detected.
00:51:13.908 - 00:52:29.660, Speaker B: So, like, in theory, I guess that could be happening and we don't know. But this kind of reasoning, I think, doesn't yet explain to me why nobody is just why someone with 40% of the hash rate would not just kind of like selfish mind for 1 hour a week or ten minutes a week or something like that. The second part of Benedict's question, which is related to, I think, what Joe is typing, or Joe's first question yeah. Is this. So I had always imagined selfish mining as being done by an individual who owns lots of hash rate, not by a pool that has more than 33, a public pool that has 33% or more. And I understand that once you ask for an individual to have 33% or more of the hash rate, that that is way less likely to happen. But I can definitely imagine that all the things that were brought up, that if you have a public pool that is going to selfish mine, that is going to be like blatantly blatantly obvious to everyone exactly who is selfish mining.
00:52:29.660 - 00:53:05.280, Speaker B: Right. Because the pool has to states to the public people who are participating that they would like them to selfish mine. Right. And so that's very different than if you just own lots of computational power and you just tell your own computational power to do it. You don't put it publicly on the Internet anywhere that you're doing this. That's what I kind of see as being like I don't know if more realistic is the right term, but that's what I always imagined would kind of happen. I kind of never seriously imagined that a public pool would publicly post something like this.
00:53:05.430 - 00:53:27.432, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I just looked it up. GHash IO was well, it was kind of a mix, I guess. They had their own hardware. They just sold shares of the hardware. So really you can think of them as one entity. So it wasn't actually possible for people. They redirected some of their own hardware to other pools, I think is what they did.
00:53:27.432 - 00:54:04.812, Speaker C: So they really had control of the hardware and could have done it, but they were basically like a public facing corporation, but it wasn't like some covert state actor or something like that. But yeah, I agree with that. It's much more likely for an individual person to do it versus a service provider. Like say it's a pool that is literally just a service provider, then it seems unlikely or users would switch away from it automatically.
00:54:04.876 - 00:54:38.590, Speaker B: Probably. Let me just catch up. Right. I think this is related to both of Joe's points too, which is just this. So anyway, that's maybe like an important point of discussion that I didn't mention. I think there is a difference between a public facing pool where everyone knows what strategy that pool is using versus just kind of like this nebulous. Someone out there seems to be selfish mining because of statistical detection, but it's not a public pool, so we don't know what they're doing.
00:54:38.590 - 00:54:51.890, Speaker B: Okay, maybe let me also add, I think by the time we get to three minutes okay.
00:54:55.060 - 00:54:57.184, Speaker A: This is great. All this discussion is great.
00:54:57.302 - 00:55:58.916, Speaker B: All right. This is the second week in a row I didn't get to exactly the same content. Maybe what I can do I don't know if there will be a third clock. I guess if there is, I will just only do this. But what I will do still is go to my conclusion slide. Okay, so basically after whatever I was going to do in the middle, there was going to be a second discussion, which is like, let's revisit why selfish mining doesn't happen in other settings. And the big difference is, in some of the results that I skipped, I want to say there are kind of like live protocols where I would say the distinction between, I think bitcoin with proof of work and for example, block reward plus proof of work.
00:55:58.916 - 00:56:32.128, Speaker B: Let's say that bullet one, so it's block reward plus proof of work. That's what we saw the analysis for. I stated the CRM that says if you have less than 32.9% of the total hash rate, then there's nothing you can do that's better than being on it. So it actually is an equilibrium in that case. However, some of the results I was going to show was that in different models there is actually, no matter how small you are, there is something strictly better than being honest that you can do right, no matter how small you are. So if you have like 0.1%
00:56:32.128 - 00:57:37.620, Speaker B: of the total stake in certain proof of stake cryptocurrencies, there's a way for you to get like zero 5% of the total fees or something, or the total revenue or something like that. If you have 10%, you can probably get close to 11% of the rewards. And there are attacks like that. They're like selfish mining. I didn't describe now what is less clear to me is I do understand why in Bitcoin there's probably not a 40% minor and I understand there's probably one or two people who have the possibility of being more than 33%. They're probably very invested in bitcoin and they don't want to have they're really sensitive to negative externalities. What I think is much harder for me to be super convinced by is that for all of these protocols, where someone who has less than 1% of the power could either the computational power or the stake or whatever, it is could strictly profit.
00:57:37.620 - 00:58:49.580, Speaker B: It's harder for me to imagine why zero people this is basically saying that everyone in the network it's hard for me to imagine that there is no one in the network who is less sensitive to the exchange rate or who is more invested in a different cryptocurrency or I don't know what. So I don't have a good answer for sort of like why stuff like this is not detected in protocols where everyone, no matter how small you are, could possibly profit. So I don't know if that kind of like, well, I guess time's up anyway. But anyway, that was kind of like the last discussion that I wanted to have. I was curious to hear if anyone had some idea of why it would be the case that on a cryptocurrency where I really think that literally everyone has some strategy they could do to get a little bit more revenue, and yet probably no one is doing that, I don't have a good understanding of why that is. Okay, so anyway, that was the takeaway, but I just skipped the content that would have supported that. So thanks again for listening and assist.
00:58:49.580 - 01:00:07.408, Speaker B: I actually have a question for proof of stake, why is the benchmark of share of longest chains the correct one when there's longer? The question was, why is fraction of locks in the longest chain for proof of stake the right measure if there is no longer a difficulty adjustment? So I have two possible answers to that. Looks like God logged off, but I was curious to hear what an economist thought of this. So one is that for even a proof of stake currency, there's still like this difference between the active stake who are actually participating in the mining protocol. It's not like you say, well, there's 10,000 units of the currency and all 10,000 of them are active. So if I want there to be a new block every minute, I just need to ask a new person to mine every minute. It could be that like 1% of the network is actually paying attention. If 1% of the network is paying attention, then and you do this protocol, then it's going to be like 100 minutes until the next block.
01:00:07.408 - 01:01:21.790, Speaker B: So one answer is, I don't know what is done in practice, but it would not surprise me if even proof of stake cryptocurrencies had some form of activity adjustment or something like that. That's one possibility. The second possibility, which I think is definitely a better question for someone with more economics background should weigh in, is I genuinely wonder whether even in the original model, you need the difficulty adjustment to claim that really you want to maximize the fraction of bitcoin that you own. Because in some sense, like, there's 21 million bitcoin, right? What if I just decided that there's 42 million bitcoin? I just double everyone's bitcoin. When I try and think of what do you actually own when you own bitcoin, the unit kind of meaningless. What you really own is you own some fraction of this digital asset that exists that's denominated in some arbitrary unit. So I don't know.
01:01:21.790 - 01:01:24.140, Speaker B: That's more of a question.
01:01:24.210 - 01:01:28.224, Speaker A: I don't know if things depend on the inflation rate.
01:01:28.342 - 01:01:28.576, Speaker B: Right.
01:01:28.598 - 01:01:58.088, Speaker A: So you're basically saying you still want to sort of maybe maximize the fraction. Your point is that suppose you're selfish mind and there wasn't a difficulty adjustment. What's that going to mean then? As long as change grow more slowly, which means the total emissions will drop, in absolute sense, your share of them will go up. And so I think that's an excellent point. But if the inflation is really small, if that's just 1% of the supply, it's not actually like it's going to be a pretty small effect.
01:01:58.174 - 01:02:27.316, Speaker B: That's a good point. Yeah, I agree with that. I guess it definitely depends on the relationship between the total existing supply and the new supply that's being created over the horizon that you're considering this attack. Is that logic even say that you really started from the beginning of time, there were no existing bitcoin? Does that sound like sound logic to you or it still sounds like something's off to me.
01:02:27.338 - 01:02:42.216, Speaker A: The way I'd say it is like, imagine the market cap of bitcoin evolved independently of kind of the distribution, which we'll get that argue about that assumption. But under that assumption, I agree with what you said then.
01:02:42.238 - 01:02:42.376, Speaker B: Cool.
01:02:42.398 - 01:02:47.480, Speaker A: You just want to maximize the fraction of the currency that's been minted.
01:02:50.860 - 01:03:38.490, Speaker B: Wouldn't it work even if the inflation was below? Right, because miners famously sell most of everything in mine that pay, like electricity and stuff like that. So if you can reduce the amount of bitcoin being limited by miners, you reduce the sell pressure of bitcoin. So you could argue that assuming that it's the most of the downer selling, that you actually you're saying that you expect that that would be another reason why the US dollar value of bitcoin would go up is because other miners are becoming more desperate to sell their stuff. Well, they can't they're not selling. It because they're selling less. And the assumption here is that all miners are reselling, but that's like a large portion of that downward pressure. That's interesting.
01:03:38.490 - 01:03:42.156, Speaker B: That sounds you're saying that you get.
01:03:42.178 - 01:03:44.748, Speaker A: A de facto lower inflation rate.
01:03:44.834 - 01:03:45.084, Speaker B: Right.
01:03:45.122 - 01:03:53.280, Speaker A: And so therefore you think of all of the inflation basically just leading immediately sell orders and it's just less Bitcoin selling.
01:03:54.900 - 01:04:40.430, Speaker B: Yeah. So if you think of the inflation rate as like the inflation is at least sold off rather than the inflation sometimes I guess the main thing you're saying is sort of like if it were the case that what's? Really driving the price of bitcoin is only the miners making it and selling it or something. Like if that's really what drives the price and it's not like some external thing, like people really want to own bitcoin, to have money overseas or whatever. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I buy that too. The other thing I would add is, for example, for a transaction, if you have a transaction fee system, you don't need the difficulty adjustment at all for any of that analysis. Right.
01:04:40.430 - 01:05:23.228, Speaker B: Because just sort of like those transactions are going to be somewhere, right. So they're going to be in if there's less blocks being created, then each block is going to have more transactions in it. And that's without even doing the expert gaming for the transaction fees. And I guess that same kind of reasoning applies to mev too, which is that if less other people are producing blocks, that stuff has to go somewhere. So that gives you more opportunities to include stuff. Yeah, I would say maybe the difficulty adjustment is like the cleanest way to just kind of say, like, here's a model. It does model an actual system.
01:05:23.228 - 01:05:57.430, Speaker B: Here's a very uncontroversial assumption that explains why this is the objective, but I bet that that is not a far off objective in some of the other systems without a difficulty adjustment. But it may not be like the story may not be quite as clean. I think the models for transaction fees are cleaner where it's really just like exogenous to the rate at which blocks are found or something.
01:05:59.560 - 01:06:24.256, Speaker E: Are you aware of empirical works that really do it feels like for something like Ethereum right, where the stell block rate is already kind of high. Like the detection here actually has to be pretty sophisticated. So I'm just like we're saying, oh yeah, we've never detected it, are we how good are we at detecting it.
01:06:24.278 - 01:06:30.690, Speaker B: And how much have we if I don't know, Joe, if you heard the question.
01:06:34.840 - 01:06:36.144, Speaker A: Joe sort of lost his voice.
01:06:36.192 - 01:06:45.880, Speaker B: Yeah, I heard, I guess. Yeah. I don't know if people have really looked on Ethereum. It also has uncle block rewards. So presumably.
01:06:49.740 - 01:06:59.180, Speaker E: I've just been looking, there's certainly no papers. Maybe back in 2014 this was done anecdotally.
01:06:59.840 - 01:07:00.636, Speaker B: Good question.
01:07:00.738 - 01:07:08.300, Speaker E: Yeah, because I mean, it is like a real effort to detect it right. You have to be online in the network.
01:07:08.380 - 01:07:17.250, Speaker B: You have to have some tool. Sorry to pump all these questions to you, Joe, but I guess you need some actually process blockchain data.
01:07:17.860 - 01:07:21.040, Speaker E: No, but I meant a tool. You need to be lying in the chain.
01:07:21.120 - 01:07:21.508, Speaker B: Right.
01:07:21.594 - 01:07:23.892, Speaker E: You just look at blockchain data after the fact.
01:07:23.946 - 01:07:25.460, Speaker B: Oh, you're saying all the orphans are.
01:07:25.530 - 01:07:31.556, Speaker E: Anyway, you have to be like, in the network, relatively well connected because all.
01:07:31.578 - 01:07:34.090, Speaker A: The stuff that got proof, you want to make sure you know about it.
01:07:34.540 - 01:07:43.630, Speaker E: Yeah. You want to see all the sales. If you don't see them, then you're not going to detect it's. Like, this is a real thing.
01:07:44.240 - 01:07:53.456, Speaker B: You'd want to see the pattern of like somebody announces several blocks in a row that build on each other. Which wouldn't happen by chance.
01:07:53.638 - 01:08:02.370, Speaker E: Yeah. It's not obvious to me that someone has reversed tried to detect it in the first place.
01:08:02.900 - 01:08:17.796, Speaker B: That sounds it's. Yeah. I don't even know who the right person. It used to be that I felt like, well, I can send Goon or Italian email, but I don't know if it's grown way beyond I mean, like.
01:08:17.818 - 01:08:24.080, Speaker E: Andrew Miller does a lot of live network analysis.
01:08:24.240 - 01:08:27.190, Speaker B: Like, just ask whether something's even been done. Yeah.
01:08:28.480 - 01:08:32.090, Speaker A: Let's continue discussion walking. We don't want to be late for office hours.
