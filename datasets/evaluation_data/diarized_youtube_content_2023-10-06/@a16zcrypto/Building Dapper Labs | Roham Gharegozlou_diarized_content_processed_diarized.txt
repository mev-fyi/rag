00:00:10.170 - 00:00:36.374, Speaker A: You know, to set the stage for a lot of the folks in the audience. We're going to cover off on a couple of themes today, things that most of us in the audience might be thinking about trying to glean from your experience. Continue with passion and ambition as we forge forward in the space. So we'll talk a little bit about your founder's journey and then finding product market fit in the crypto space. And along the way we'll hopefully have some fun. That sound good?
00:00:36.412 - 00:00:37.014, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:00:37.052 - 00:01:02.746, Speaker A: Cool. Well, we're going to dive into blockchain and web three. That's why we're all here. But first, with a room full of founders, I would totally be remiss not to ask you about your decision to leave what might seem like a stable biology, MD, PhD, path at Stanford and start your venture studio. Axiom Zen, what kind of went into that decision making process? How did you make that decision?
00:01:02.938 - 00:01:29.314, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think the best piece of advice I got at that age was from my academic advisor, who's a very interesting guy, Robert Sipolski. You should read his book, why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers. I'll make a plug there. But he said, hey, if you're not sure what you want to do, go try it. And I was on this path of hey, biology and biotech and all this stuff. And then the goal wasn't to become a doctor, but to go into. So I took a year off from Stanford and went to a biotech internship.
00:01:29.314 - 00:02:05.842, Speaker B: Just the first couple of weeks I realized, hey, this stuff's going to move too slowly. So I think it was more of a my personality just fits with technology where I can do something, hit a button and see the reaction. And it was kind of an instant decision. I didn't first start the venture studio. I went through a securitist path, joined the nonprofit, helped some founders find in Middle East, connect with VCs and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to provide mentorship. Got to meet a lot of VCs and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley through that process. Got an internship at a venture capital firm, helped them start a seed fund.
00:02:05.842 - 00:02:24.582, Speaker B: Got to understand the zero to one sort of process of ideation and what seems to be successful, what seems to not be successful. This took two and a half years or so and then sort of quit that to start my own thing. And that was in 2012. It's about three years after graduating.
00:02:24.646 - 00:02:59.750, Speaker A: Okay. And I think we all kind of have that person who pulled us down like the proverbial rabbit hole, crypto rabbit hole, I don't know, show of hands. Who can identify the person who got them into crypto? Okay, so a good majority of us can remember, like, pointing at each other. Yeah, right, exactly. So a good majority of us can remember that moment, remember that person. Do you have a moment? Do you have a person in your life where you kind of reflect now, kind of nearly a decade on, that was my AHA moment.
00:02:59.900 - 00:03:28.720, Speaker B: Yeah. So I started. Axiom zen december 2012 april 2013. I got an email from this ex Apple engineer, Deeter Shirley, just kind of a one page application, just a cover letter, no resume. Well, with a very simple sort of like, bullet point resume. And he ended up joining our team a couple of months later as chief architect at Axiom Zen. And he had been mining bitcoin on his laptop and sort of home computer from sort of earlier days, whenever that was possible.
00:03:28.720 - 00:04:16.118, Speaker B: And so he kept bringing it up as a technology shift that we should pay attention to, rather than, hey, go buy the currency. And then about a year after that, we started kind of playing around with bitcoin, did an internal hackathon, and a few months later went to Vegas for Money 2020, where we won the grand prize at the hackathon. Two of our three projects were bitcoin projects. Sort of like little one was a little game where you could challenge someone else in bitcoin, so I could wager bitcoin, play a little flappy birds thing, and if I beat you, you would win the bitcoin. And so we kind of had those ideas from early on because in 2012, if you think about it, you're at kind of the mobile shift is happening. We built an Apple App of the Year app, but it's a red ocean. Like, it's a lot of competition, a lot of pressure.
00:04:16.118 - 00:04:45.654, Speaker B: And so we were finding, hey, what's a new kind of channel, what's a new platform? And so crypto we looked at it in that aspect of how can we build things that it felt freeing. You can build something that anyone could come in and wager a million dollars, theoretically, in bitcoin. Now, obviously, the user experience was terrible. You have to sort of sit there for a long time. Most transactions failed. It wasn't a thing that was going to work, but it was an intellectually exciting kind of exercise. So that was from back then.
00:04:45.654 - 00:05:00.140, Speaker B: I mean, we didn't really go heavy in on it, but we were playing around with it for a while. So when the wave started happening in 2016 with Ethereum, we were kind of attuned to, hey, let's pay attention and see if there's something we can do here.
00:05:01.150 - 00:05:32.626, Speaker A: It's really great to hear you kind of informally talk about that sensation of building in the space, like this concept of it being open and free. 2016 Ethereum is obviously growing from a network perspective, and you are writing an open source standard for NFTs. So one, I would be like, remiss also not to ask, do you think you are the first person to use the phrase non fungible tokens?
00:05:32.818 - 00:05:35.462, Speaker B: We tried to find other examples. I can't find it. Okay?
00:05:35.516 - 00:05:36.680, Speaker A: Because I can't either.
00:05:38.010 - 00:06:37.446, Speaker B: The first draft of it was non fungible assets NFAs, which wouldn't have worked if you think about it, because NFA is not financial advice, so it wouldn't have been memeable in a so I'm glad dieter ended up changing. It wasn't me, it was dieter. Shirley to be clear, but this concept of a non fungible x has know that's what it is. It's a definitional term, but kind of applying it to blockchain digital assets and then identifying that there needed to be a standard, otherwise it wouldn't have the network effects that it could. Because crypto punks existed at the time where pepe's there were colored coins on bitcoin, there were examples of digital assets that were non fungible, but because there was no common standard, it was difficult to build. On top of that, it was difficult to have a marketplace that displays that have a wallets, that can display the art, have loaning platforms and DeFi platforms that you could collateralize with it. That's sort of where we felt the standard was necessary.
00:06:37.558 - 00:06:58.260, Speaker A: The decision to create an open standard and to write an open standard for non fungible tokens, kind of walk me through, or walk us through that decision making process. Is it the general ethos of the space that the reason behind it was this open standard and wanting to help proliferate the technology? What was the inspiration behind putting it out there?
00:06:58.950 - 00:07:52.210, Speaker B: It was sort of two things in parallel. One was the idea of CryptoKitties wasn't the only idea we were sort of brainstorming and wanted to explore. Building on ethereum at the time. There were ICOs brave had just done a $30 million sale that was sort of the biggest at the time. And we were looking at the promises people are making and saying, well, this isn't exactly possible, but there's a lot that's interesting here. The goal of the nonfudgible token like CryptoKitties was one of several ideas, multiple of which needed a common standard, and including real estate fractionalization, including how do you represent plots of land, and if you wanted to put land and title on the blockchain, how would you even represent that? Because do you create everything as an individual cryptocurrency? Do you create new coins for every type of digital asset, for every type of realty? It just didn't make sense. And so sort of other ideas led to it.
00:07:52.210 - 00:08:49.202, Speaker B: And then once we had the idea of CryptoKitties, once we sort of started testing it and realized, hey, this thing's really fun, we realized that having a go to market that included a shift to the technology as big as ERC 20 would kind of attract the right kind of attention, and it would be a good base to launch from. So we published the first draft of the standard September 20, and then launched the game October 20. Eigth as a beta at the first ethereum global event. So it took like a month for the product to come out on top of the standard, and no one cared about the standard until the product came out, which is the reality. The tech by itself is sort of intriguing to some people, but as soon as the product hits and the users start using it, that's when people's imagination gets ignited of, oh, wait, you could apply it to all these other things and then everybody got involved to kind of flesh it out and incorporate it as a formal part of ethereum.
00:08:49.346 - 00:09:26.980, Speaker A: I think that's a really nice way of thinking about the group here and building on open source technology and with open source technology. And the canonical use case for that open source standard is CryptoKitties. And I want to spend a little bit of time talking about that because I think it's a really nice way to unpack some themes for the group. So you fast forward a little bit CryptoKitties becomes one of the most widely used applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Like kind of infamously slows down block time brings Ethereum to a halt. And so you're in this moment, there's this one hand of really concrete product market fit. Because you brought Ethereum to a halt, there's so many people using it.
00:09:26.980 - 00:09:36.454, Speaker A: But unearthing, maybe a design flaw at the time with where CryptoKitties was deployed. So how did you rationalize those two things happening at the same time?
00:09:36.572 - 00:10:47.500, Speaker B: Yeah, CryptoKitties at one point represented 30% of all the gas spent on the Ethereum network. So it sort of was a real problem for ICOs and all the early fintech kind of applications. But I think that this happened again with TOPSHOT. Really successful products sometimes make you think you have product market fit even though you're making the revenue, but you might not have authentic product market fit because a lot of the energy underlying that revenue is actually speculative. So that level of energy, I think is good because from a certain perspective it brings people, it sacks people, it gets money in the door and helps you fund future development. But also you got to ask the question, hey, is that Fit with the right community? Right? And is that community there for the right reasons? And how can I kind of build on that and make sure that you're treating it in the right way? Now, on Ethereum though, we saw terrible new user conversion rates where if you had an Ethereum wallet and you had Ethereum, you could play the game and it was fun, but if you didn't, it was nearly impossible. And then secondly, of course, it was the performance question.
00:10:47.500 - 00:11:32.214, Speaker B: So that's partially why we started approlabs. We launched CryptoKitties as a bootstrap company that I was sole shareholder of and we had never raised outside money and we decided to make Dapper because we realized, holy crap, the gap is actually big. And to enable the next wave of developers, people have to simplify a lot of these bits and pieces because even building CryptoKitties was really difficult. But then realizing, oh wow, now I have to solve scalability and solve the user experience problem. And there's nothing there at the time. So there was no Openc, there was no Alchemy, there was none of the products, there was no Zeppelin, there was no crypto startup scale, there was no A 16 Z crypto.
00:11:32.262 - 00:11:32.860, Speaker A: Right?
00:11:33.310 - 00:11:50.414, Speaker B: And so it's sort of a lot of the stuff that we rely on today didn't exist, but it was a complicated sort of securitist route to get us to where we are today, which is NBA, NFL onflow, and just a different sort of stage for the next bear market, if you will.
00:11:50.452 - 00:12:25.686, Speaker A: Yeah, you cut your teeth for us, for sure. I think that's a really interesting concept and maybe one that we all here kind of grapple with from time to time is you hit these technological complexities or roadblocks. And I think there's a very reasonable argument to be made of. Like, you could have looked at the issues with Ethereum and thought, isn't this somebody else's problem? So you decide to build, like, how do you find the confidence to take that on? You're going from deploying an NFT based game to now building an entire ecosystem.
00:12:25.878 - 00:13:00.982, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look at the time we built CryptoKitties. We also had developer facing products, so we built ZenHub and some other things. So we always knew how to interface with developers. But for the first year and a half, we didn't have that confidence. And in our most of the advice we got was, hey, stay focused on what you're good at, which is building applications for consumers. But the more we interview, I spoke to Vitalik personally, I spoke to all of the current builders of all the top layer ones. And at the time, there was no NFTs, weren't a thing.
00:13:00.982 - 00:13:28.986, Speaker B: 2018, 2019, the idea of web three for consumers wasn't A or crypto for consumers. Crypto for consumer applications wasn't that interesting. It was about DFI. It was about the future of finance. It was about onboarding institutions. I mean, to an extent, for many people it still is. And so the platforms, the way they're built weren't as a product person, it was too much risk.
00:13:28.986 - 00:14:00.670, Speaker B: It was too difficult. It felt like trying to build Angry Birds on the BlackBerry, right? It's just not fun for the customer and it's not fun for the developer. And so something's got to give. And when I talk to all the builders of these layer ones, they don't have empathy for the pain we're feeling as consumer developers. And so we reinvented a lot on flow. But before we did, we built the first smart contract wallet on Ethereum for consumers. First wallet to do gas, pay gas on behalf of consumers, first wallet to do key recovery on behalf of consumers, first wallet to integrate credit card payments for NFCs on behalf of consumers.
00:14:00.670 - 00:14:24.990, Speaker B: We built two of the most complex Ethereum games that exist CryptoKitties and cheese wizards. Cheese wizards came within 42 bytes of the EVM bytecode limit. So we went deep on Ethereum. We had written more smart contracts than anybody. First Openc smart contract was for CryptoKitties, first Axe smart contract was for CryptoKitties. All the open Zeppelin drafts for CryptoKitties. So we were deep on Ethereum.
00:14:24.990 - 00:15:01.754, Speaker B: But all this stuff is just too hard. It's hard to build a house on stilts, right? As a developer, you're spending all your time just catching up. And so that's why we created Flow. And Flow, like, it's three years old, so it's still or two and a half in a sense. And it's still early, but today it's fully decentralized, fully permissionless. We had to build a whole new programming language from the ground up that works a lot like Move does today. But it's so much easier to read, write, reason with it's so much more capable because we've written more smart contracts than anybody, and we wrote it for consumer applications.
00:15:01.754 - 00:15:48.106, Speaker B: So everyone's excited about account abstraction on Flow, on Ethereum. That has existed on flow at the protocol level from the beginning. And more recently, we've implemented changes that actually make it really easier for think about a mobile app. Are you going to pop out of the mobile app every time to sign a transaction to go back in? That's insane for a customer. If you're a game, you're going to say, hey, to sign up for my game, go sign up for this other wallet, or pick from this list of twelve wallets. That's not how consumers are going to behave. So how do you let an app onboard a customer and then let the customer connect it to their wallet afterwards? And how do you cycle keys? And how do you have all of these things that sound simple but were just incredibly hard to do on Ethereum and very costly? Right.
00:15:48.106 - 00:16:42.406, Speaker B: Dapper wallet ended up costing us insane amounts just in gas fees to maintain that smart contract infrastructure, which, by the way, is what you have to do to do account abstraction, et cetera. And then the solutions people suggested sharding layer two state channels, and people were so sure that state channels were the future. Do you hear anything about them? No. I bet you guys plasma, right? You guys have heard of plasma or there's things that people were so sure was part of the future that that sounds really hard, man. And it sounds really sort of far from me being able to build a business on it. That was the problem. People were a lot of theory without a lot of how do you build a business on it? Look, but I don't know if it was the right or I know it was the right choice, but I don't know if it's the right choice to do that again now because the market is much more mature and in a sense, it was maybe the wrong choice to even enter the market at that early on.
00:16:42.406 - 00:17:03.342, Speaker B: Because think about it was six years ago and it was through sighted visionary investors know Chris Dixon and Fred Wilson and others who said well, hey, this is small today, but it'll be big tomorrow. And so let's sort of spend a lot of money trying to get it there, that we got it there. It was pretty heavy lift.
00:17:03.406 - 00:17:42.320, Speaker A: Well, I think it's good to take stock for a moment relative to where we are today in this cohort. The technology they're building on today looks very different than the technology six years ago, as you were mentioning. If you could impart on the group again, what gives you that confidence to kind of just set the goalpost and don't let it move and just keep going towards it? And granted, you will probably have to call an audible on your way down the field sometimes, but how do you find that conviction? What gets you excited every day? How do we all maintain the level of enthusiasm that you clearly have for what you're building?
00:17:42.770 - 00:18:07.894, Speaker B: I just try to keep it simple. And to be honest, it was a lot harder during the bull market times to keep people focused, because every little thing was like, hey, these other guys are so successful. That has to be the right way. These other guys are so successful. But the reality is, anything you tossed up in the air flew, right? Like it didn't correlate. So now it's a little bit easier because everyone's depressed. And so you offer a vision of the future, and everyone's like, okay, that makes sense.
00:18:07.894 - 00:18:54.918, Speaker B: But if you think about it, it's just super simple. Does ownership matter to humans? Yes or no, right? Will digital life matter as much as physical life? Yes or no? That's all that matters, right? So will ownership matter in the digital world? Should ownership be adjudicated by a single company? Right? Like, these are very simple answers. Ownership should not be adjudicated by a single company. It can't be. And so it hasn't existed on the modern internet. The concept of ownership only exists inside games or 99 cent stickers or whatever it is. How is that human? Right? It's a blip on the evolutionary timescale, right? For 10,000 years, people have been expressing their identity through ownership, whether it's what they wear or what they hang around their necks or seashells they collect and give to their love and whatever it is.
00:18:54.918 - 00:19:38.310, Speaker B: And so people haven't been able to do that digitally. Now, this is people doing that digitally. What manifested during 2021, 2022 of people getting so hyped up on a particular expression of digital ownership? That's kind of what happened during 99, 2000, when people get hyped up on one expression of transferring information across telephone lines, right? But yes, it's website.com and sort of banner ads and all that stuff. But what the Internet came to matter 20 years later is much more than that. And I think web three is the same, where we get so hung up on one aspect of it because there's so much money in it too, right? Like, we're all entrepreneurs. If you can toss something in the air and get $10 million for it, you're going to do it.
00:19:38.310 - 00:19:46.360, Speaker B: And so it distracts from how do you add real value to real people?
00:19:49.690 - 00:20:20.738, Speaker A: I highly recommend Roham gave a talk in 2017 called Life is Non Fungible. It's a Ted Talk. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend you watch it. The reference to Seashells makes an appearance and talking about some of these concepts. So definitely, please after this, definitely watch it. You'll definitely have some questions coming your way after folks get a hold of it, but so I wanted to just take a step back and think about again where we are. We're in a period of time where this cohort is building on technology that looks a little bit different.
00:20:20.738 - 00:20:50.860, Speaker A: So success in the space is hard to define, but I would largely argue that CryptoKitties NBA TOPSHOT, bringing the likes of major global web two brands into the space could be a measure of success. How did you think about that transition from, okay, we own the IP for CryptoKitties, we're going to go now, work with the NBA, license that IP and build this really aggressive at the time project for them? What was the thought process around that?
00:20:51.310 - 00:21:33.370, Speaker B: So we launched CryptoKitties end of 2017, and then a lot of brands came to us. And so we had been talking to the NBA for a long time, kind of just educating them on the platform and things like that. But in the middle of 2019, industry perception was very negative regarding NFTs in particular, but also crypto in general. And so we thought that it was very important to bring something that kind of shocked people out of their complacency in a way and said, hey, this is and just the analogy of sports trading cards is so perfect because it's just a physical thing now. You're just making it digital and it's better. At the time, there was like a year long wait for PSA ratings. It's still six months or longer at the time.
00:21:33.370 - 00:22:16.198, Speaker B: Still today, it's so complicated to sell stuff on ebay on a digital marketplace. You can sell a thing for a dollar, pay $0.05 in fees, and you're done, right? And so no poster stamps, no rating, no authenticity, guaranteed all the change. So the category made a ton of sense and big IPS and startups don't usually mix, and that's for good reason. I would heavily recommend against working with big IPS, just kind of in general as a startup because it takes a lot of effort unless is like, you'll know, it the rule is there. Now, obviously the rules are there to be broken so people can break the rules. But the only reason we broke the rules was we had a long history of working with bigger companies.
00:22:16.198 - 00:22:50.930, Speaker B: And it's a really tough balance to play because at a startup, what matters is iteration, speed. What matters is changing direction. What matters is learning something in the morning and acting on it before noon. And that's just not how bigger partners work. So I want to kind of make sure I give that message, because it adds a huge level of complexity to anything that you do. But at the time, we sort of had the playbook digital ownership, trading cards, but digital. And so we wanted a big brand that we could sort of shock people out of complacency de risk distribution to an know you're guaranteed.
00:22:50.930 - 00:23:31.406, Speaker B: And the NBA has just been fantastic partners the whole way. So I think that sports IPS and kind of digital ownership in sports is going to be one of the biggest categories of digital ownership, just like it is in physical ownership, right? Like collectibles of jerseys and trading cards. And also, why do people collect? To express. And they collect to express. And fandom. And fandom for most people, not as much for technologists, but for most of the world, is concentrated in sports, right? And technology is other things, maybe gaming or whatever it is. But outside of technology, sports is what still sort of runs the world.
00:23:31.406 - 00:24:03.718, Speaker B: So that was very important to us. And then going from NBA, NFL, and we have Premier League and others as big, we are going outside of sports as well. But sports is going to always be a core pillar for us. And the sports viewing experience has not evolved at all in the digital world. You have streaming. That's about it, right? And so there's no digital aspect to fandom. And Silicon Valley is very skeptical of sports, right? If you look at the top sports companies, they're terrible at product, and if you look at the top product companies, they're terrible at sports.
00:24:03.718 - 00:24:25.754, Speaker B: So Amazon's doing streaming, YouTube's doing streaming, facebook's had partnerships with Sports League the whole time. They're not good at figuring out what a sports fan wants. And sports companies like Fanatics and others are not good at building products. So it's just a good place to be. But it's very tough to work with big IPS and sort of educate them on how to work with startups.
00:24:25.882 - 00:25:09.680, Speaker A: Well, I love that piece of advice surfaces in a talk like this. I think it's really valuable for the cohort and for everyone who's thinking about that bold call to action statement of onboard the next 1 billion users to crypto. How do you do that? How do you solve that? And sometimes looking at the web two partnerships is a theory that could maybe hold true in helping make good on that statement. So on this topic of advice, I want to make sure we leave time for questions. But on the topic of advice, what is one piece of advice that you maybe unsolicited even, that you're really pumped that you got and listened to and then flip side one piece of advice you're really thankful you threw away and did not listen to.
00:25:10.210 - 00:25:47.094, Speaker B: That's a great question. So the one that's top of mind for the first one is polygrams do things that don't scale. Because it's one thing I'm sort of pushing my team a lot right now. So we're a big company, but still, sometimes people are like, oh, that's not a big enough idea. No, go grab your iPad, sign people up one by one, talk to the customer that's do things that don't scale. And I think that's really important. And in terms of advice to not follow, it's generally always good to follow the advice of focus and sort of being very focused on your mission and your theory.
00:25:47.094 - 00:26:37.500, Speaker B: But in a lot of ways, we gained a lot from having our ears to the ground on other things, and a lot of our experiments failed. And we had backup plans in parallel with doing a lot of the scalability research, well, in parallel with meeting with all of the vitaliks and all the people working on layer two, figuring out how to build on with Algorand work, with Solana work, whatever. We were doing our own research of what it would look like to build our own chain. And so that's big part of what gave us confidence. We were working on it parallel with the NBA. We're talking to them for a whole year as we were trying to build on Ethereum and build our own projects, CryptoKitties cheese wizards, we were telling them, hey, this possibility that there might be this new network flow that we're working on. So we're sort of always having an idea of, well, what if we're wrong? And what's our plan if we're wrong? And how do we know we're wrong as early as possible.
00:26:37.500 - 00:26:43.334, Speaker B: It's just a nuanced, I guess, approach.
00:26:43.462 - 00:27:13.014, Speaker A: Well, I definitely want to open it up for questions. I just first want to say I'm very grateful. We are very grateful, as a lot of the cohort works through their own founders journey to be able to sit up here and pick your brain and have this access to you. So thank you for joining us. We are going to open it up for questions. So there's a microphone, as everyone's familiar with the drill, you know, questions for Roham on his founder's journey, finding product, market, fit, whatever is burning, feel free to lob his way.
00:27:13.212 - 00:27:30.694, Speaker C: Hey, Roham, thanks for the talk. This is Jess. I'm building blockus. We're a Web three gaming infra company. Also Canadian. I'm from Toronto, so love Dapper Labs. Like, from CryptoKitties to NFL, all day to TOPSHOT.
00:27:30.742 - 00:27:30.986, Speaker B: You guys.
00:27:31.008 - 00:27:37.546, Speaker C: Just like I have to say, at the risk of offending others, you guys have got the sauce in terms of taste and vibe.
00:27:37.578 - 00:27:37.918, Speaker B: Check.
00:27:38.004 - 00:28:03.030, Speaker C: Really appreciate that. Question is around what's your vision for the flow blockchain, especially when it comes to engagement within the. Sports area. Like gaming is the vision to become the chain for sports gaming. Like running tournaments, like having games on top of there that's licensed by the same IP or maybe something completely different. Just want to hear your thoughts on vision for the Flow blockchain.
00:28:03.530 - 00:28:42.210, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. Thank you. So the Flow was always built as an application platform. That's sort of what it was ideated as. So applications could include games or other kinds of products. But this concept of product serving mainstream customers so you need really good user experience, you might need to do things on behalf of the customer, you might need to have paths from custody to non custody and so doing all of that in a way that's seamless but decentralized. That's sort of what the objective of Flow has been across its existence and also making it really easy to write complex smart contracts.
00:28:42.210 - 00:29:32.226, Speaker B: That's sort of what Cadence is built for. So mainstream customer user experience, complex smart contracts or composability with others, that's sort of the long term of what the technology was built to enable. Now in terms of gaming in particular, there are a number of games on Flow and incoming to Flow. And the number one thing that I think makes Flow easier for games is the hybrid custody piece where games can start a user off with an application custody wallet that the user can take and connect to their self custody wallet at any time. But the game retains authority to make changes within that application ecosystem. So if you're in the app, you don't have to leave the app to sign transactions. You sign the transactions right there in the app, but the app only has control over the assets of the app.
00:29:32.226 - 00:30:06.910, Speaker B: The same way your sort of phone works. Each application has access to its own sandbox, but the user sort of has the operating system has access to everything. So self custody would have access to everything. So Flow in a sense was to make it really easy for developers to build easy user experiences and complex software that is seamless to the customer, whether it's games or anything else. There's a full Unity SDK now, Unreal is coming soon and so all of those pieces are getting easier and easier over time.
00:30:07.060 - 00:30:43.530, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Brandon. Thanks so much for the talk. Our team gets constant feedback that we should make it feel more like NBA TOPSHOT in terms of how great it is for consumers. So just great job with the product design. I feel like it's a pretty legendary move to write one of the biggest smart contracts on Ethereum and then kind of fork and go write your own blockchain like that's pretty dope now that it's 2023. Would your advice for founders today in terms of achieving consumer UX and blockchain scalability, would it be build application specific blockchains build on Flow or trust the vision of L two scalability?
00:30:46.590 - 00:31:47.710, Speaker B: Obviously I have sort of a horse in the race. I think there's really interesting things happening with the Ethereum l two space, but it's a lot of unanswered questions, like, how is the complexity going to work over time? And sort of there's an assumption that, hey, developers will figure it out. But the more layers of developers there are, the more complex the end user's job is and the more stilts that they have to rely on. So what the hell is the point? And so, in a lot of ways, Flow is built to say, hey, you can build it right on a protocol, and we do all of that account abstraction and all the stuff that you need to enable the right user experience, or we, as in the Flow network does. But of course, third parties and other infrastructure layers can exist. And so I think if you're interested in building for crypto audiences, it's very obvious that the Ethereum space has extreme network effects. And it's sort of the place to be if you're building for a mainstream audience and you can enable a mainstream level user experience.
00:31:47.710 - 00:32:25.660, Speaker B: I think we've been the team that's been focused on that since 2017, and our entire ecosystem is focused on that. So we have all of those pieces in place, which is why projects like Doodles said, hey, the marketplaces on Flow are actually easier to use with the target customer for doodles too, whereas, like the doodles themselves, they can stay on Ethereum because they're thousands of dollars each, and they're not targeted at that sort of mainstream audience. So that's kind of, I guess, the advice I would give is, which audience are you optimizing for? Because in a sense, that's the audience that those platforms are optimizing for.
00:32:27.070 - 00:32:28.300, Speaker D: Cool. Thank you.
00:32:31.310 - 00:33:12.842, Speaker E: Hi. Thank you for your talk. I'm Nikita from Chain Patrol. Vito is my co founder, a team at you at East Denver. I wanted to ask you kind of started building a lot of web, kind of like web two, like traditional applications, and then you transitioned into the kind of the crypto space. How did you take the time to learn about the space, and how did you kind of, I guess, upskill or train your team? And then how do you think about hiring new developers? Do you hire experienced people who have experience in the crypto space? Or if you hire inexperienced people, how do you make sure that they have all the knowledge they need to work effectively on Flow, like building a blockchain from the ground up?
00:33:12.976 - 00:34:51.260, Speaker B: Yeah, that second one has been challenging because I think, well, at this point, there's so much information out there that if a developer walks in, not having even looked at sort of solidity code or understanding the dynamics of digital ownership and this kind of thing, then they don't have that intellectual curiosity in the space. So I would say it's really important to go after people who are just and things change so fast that you just want people, even if they're maybe not like Raw, the top computer scientists, et cetera, that are just passionate about staying in touch with what are people doing, what's risky? What are the most recent exploits, what are the user experience patterns and how are people accomplishing? It's just so much context, right? And so that would be what we've seen is, like, product minded engineers that are passionate about the mission of building products, that are Web Three based, that customers want to use. That's what you need right now because there's so much technical risks and complexity at every level of anything you want to do. And whether you're building on APIs or building if you're building Raw on the layer one, obviously there's a high degree of complexity. If you're building on APIs, you need to understand what all of the abstraction layers that you're building on, right, and what's the risk that you're taking and what does that mean for your customer and all that stuff. So I think that just intellectual curiosity about the space is by far the number one criteria. And then use that in sort of that should be demonstrated, right? If someone shows up to your interview and they're not prepared, it's not good enough for us.
00:34:51.260 - 00:36:11.620, Speaker B: In the years pre Axioms Then, we were not just building normal software. The mission was shape the impact of emerging technology. So we were always kind of on that blurred line between we're looking at crypto, looking at early natural language processing stuff, which kind of funny how things turn out, and then early sort of AR VR kind of applications. And even our mobile stuff was centered around, hey, how do we create sort of open things? And even at one point exploring AirDrop based games and stuff like that. So it was always like, what's the next thing? Because the last thing is just it seemed too crowded in a way and just not as intellectually exciting. So one thing Axioms Then did do is do so we bootstrapped the whole company, and part of what we did was provide services, consulting to bigger companies where we would help them with emerging. Hey, you know, Lululemon, what does machine learning mean for you? And how do you think about, you know, recommendation engines for your carts versus whatever it is and what is an innovation process? And how do you we helped CAA set up their first venture studio, or kind of incubator in a sense.
00:36:11.620 - 00:36:39.530, Speaker B: But how do we originally train people? You just take back end engineers that are really intellectually curious, but also you need a little bit of not the move fast, break things people, but let's take this shit seriously. Drop architecture diagrams. Think of the abstraction layers. Like, you need a little bit of that for the smart contract layer. But remember, apps are not just smart contracts here. I'll just say one little thing. Most of the crypto space is in this mindset.
00:36:39.530 - 00:37:23.578, Speaker B: The analogy I use is open source. So I think majority of software we use today uses open source, but majority of software we use today is not open source, right? We use software itself that has closed source components as well as open source components. The entire crypto space behaves as if the majority of software in the future will be open state. Like it'll just be serverless, it will be just smart contracts served directly to web interfaces. There's nothing in history to sort of imply that that's going to be the case. We believe the majority of software in the future will have open state components. It'll allow people to come with their own data, log in with their own sort of access keys, have control over their own assets and information.
00:37:23.578 - 00:38:09.850, Speaker B: But yeah, there's going to be mobile apps in the future and they're going to have locally hosted code, right? There's going to be back end software code in the future. And guess what? Most business logic should exist in the back end because it's easier to manipulate and as long as it doesn't break trust for the customer, you want to prioritize iteration speed, not just some intellectual idea of decentralization, right? You just put decentralization of where it matters to the customer. So that's my quick sort of bit on that. You're going to need all types of engineers, right? And you're going to need especially the kind of people who are going to be user driven enough to, say, insist. No, this piece needs to be decentralized. Because otherwise we're breaking the promise of the customer versus and look, we haven't as Dapper Labs. We made some mistakes on that, by the way, or some compromises that took too long to uncompromise.
00:38:09.850 - 00:38:14.410, Speaker B: But you guys don't have to make the same mistakes.
00:38:14.990 - 00:38:16.746, Speaker E: Thank you for the really detailed answer.
00:38:16.848 - 00:38:17.740, Speaker B: For sure.
00:38:19.870 - 00:38:46.950, Speaker F: How's it going? My name is Adam, I'm with Bello. Part of being in CSS is talking to users, right, for the category of the product that we're building in, I'd argue you fall in line with what we're building in. We build NFT Analytics. So I'm trying to understand better, like what does your data stack sort of look like? Your tooling stack to measure audience behavior, engagement to track the success of on chain activity, who your collectors are. I'd love to just kind of pick your brain on that for a minute.
00:38:47.770 - 00:39:45.730, Speaker B: So to be honest, our data stack is completely off chain right now, where it's all instrumented front end, back end, but it's a little frustrating because all that information includes all of the on chain data, but it also includes people who come to the website, don't make a purchase. So it includes more than just the people who are even logged in, et cetera. And there aren't really that many good tools for developers to use in terms of on chain analytics. Actually, our hackathon project at Ethwater lou in 2017 was kind of like a little on chain mix panel. So I think there's a lot of value there, but it's not yet well set up and also it's not yet well integrated. Like there's no on chain component of mixpanel or whatever it is. And so maybe it'll follow the same trend of mobile analytics where it's just like you'll have specialized tools and then they'll get kind of either soaked up or blown out into the generalist tools, but you sort of need end to end visibility.
00:39:45.730 - 00:40:49.242, Speaker B: Right before my customer touches the chain, they are still important to me right from the moment they hit the website. We need to be able to follow them and soon when they have the mobile app. But sort of where the on chain comes into play is we should be able to tell what else are our customers doing because it's all right there. What other applications are you participating in? Do they have other funds in their wallet? So on and so forth. I think there's a lot of untapped opportunity there, Frank. So I think it's a big space you're playing in and there currently aren't good solutions. And maybe one just suggestion I would have for you is how can you provide your capabilities but have them fit into like a segment or a sort of wider data stack? Or is there an easy way to pull it directly into BigQuery or tableau or whatever it is and sort of even have that as a parallel check on the back end data? Because that would be valuable because chain data is always true.
00:40:49.242 - 00:41:01.418, Speaker B: And so sometimes our community beats us where they have more accurate data than we do because they've built all their data, all their tools, all the data analytics on the chain directly, whereas all of ours are off chain.
00:41:01.594 - 00:41:09.220, Speaker F: And last question, you mentioned mixed panel and other off chain data sources. Anything that you use for on chain to just see activity as of now?
00:41:10.950 - 00:41:31.706, Speaker B: No, they just pull it directly. So flow access nodes have like a data layer and then we have community UIs. Literally the community team goes in and uses third party interfaces that sometimes have better data than we do. So, open to chat. Let's do it. Absolutely cool.
00:41:31.808 - 00:41:36.426, Speaker A: Adam, respect the prospecting in the Q A. Love it.
00:41:36.448 - 00:41:37.094, Speaker B: Always be selling.
00:41:37.142 - 00:41:38.860, Speaker A: Yeah, always be selling. Love it.
00:41:40.110 - 00:41:58.770, Speaker C: Thanks for the talk. Nithya from Capsule here, we're building better transaction signing infrastructure. Wanted to just ask, you mentioned a lot of the very salient points around user experience, the challenges, the ways it's all improved. What do you think are the remaining challenges around actual barriers to more mainstream users coming into this space, whether UX or otherwise?
00:42:03.040 - 00:43:06.704, Speaker B: Well, I think the biggest challenge or the biggest thing that I think is the biggest unlock will be new value propositions to new groups of users. So we have, I think, in cryptocurrency with a specific value proposition. And in NFTs we've been very hyper, including us, we've been very hyper focused on the value proposition of this is a better collectible for people that enjoy collecting, people who want to express their identity through ownership, join other communities based on ownership of similar assets, et cetera. That's like one angle of what digital ownership could mean, right? You can imagine infinite varieties of what else. So I think that that's one unlock is like going beyond the hey, this is about minting 10,000 things and then putting them on a marketplace and sort of them going up or down in value and that's it. That's the only usage of the product or the technology. But I think it's going to take discipline or guts to go out of that because you know, that's a multibillion dollar market that could grow into 100 billion dollar, even trillion dollar market.
00:43:06.704 - 00:43:38.952, Speaker B: So it's a very rich area for exploration future of digital ownership. But I think it's important to sort of start branching out from there then when you talk about user experience, user experience is still terrible. Even on flow. The user experience of which wallet do I choose? Not all wallets have parity blockto is actually cross chain flow and ethereum, which is nice. But to a customer it's kind of crazy. You have to use a different browser to use a different corner of the internet. That's really challenging.
00:43:38.952 - 00:45:14.520, Speaker B: And then you have things like, hey, you have an NBA TOPSHOT, which is the top NBA collectible, but then you have an NBA ticketmaster NFT that comes from a ticket stub of a game you went to both of them happy to be on the same chain. They don't do anything together yet, right? So what is that promise to the customer of hey, these are assets that interoperate and value that kind of compounds if that hasn't happened yet. And then you have the biggest NFT marketplace OpenSea or Blur or whatever, where you can't take your top shot NFT into. And so those little things to us is like, oh well, obviously that's a different blockchain, but to a customer is like the fuck are you talking about? What's the point of all of what you just said? You're talking about open internet and interoperability and all that stuff. So I think there's a gap of just the reality of that, I think. Will it be bridges? Will it be? My theory is that the wallet itself ends up being the multi chain thing, right? Like the interface of the customer into multiple but and then when you talk about kind of ethereum, what is the best in class user experience? You buy an asset and it goes into either a fully custodial wallet nifty gateway, et cetera, which is kind of like what breaks a little bit of the point, or it goes into a fully noncustodial wallet where you either have to go get a wallet for yourself, or it's kind of like maybe Magic Link, et cetera tied to your email, which is fantastic. But then where do you go from there? Right? The path is sort of a little bit stilted and broken and so I think that's what we're trying to fix with hybrid custody, but it's not even implemented that way in our own products.
00:45:14.520 - 00:46:18.252, Speaker B: Right. Where you onboard into NBA TOPSHOT and you're still in a custodial environment and there's still not that next step to, okay, I plug in my MetaMask and now I sort of have self at least I have the option of self custody over my accounts. And that gives me access into a universe of other applications which don't have to talk to Dapper and don't have to care who there's. Even that onboarding path is still kind of stilted on crypto, which is, again, lots of opportunity for developers. But there's that chicken and egg of like how much of the tech do you build yourself? How much do you focus on being a tech provider? But then how do you bring the users without enough application builders? And I think that that's both the chicken and egg and the reason that I think crypto will be an opportunity for the next few years because it's going to take people that sort of see through a little bit of the fog. And also I would just pick things that are pick value that you can deliver to customers easily. So I don't know if I cover all your questions, but that's sort of my long answer to short question.
00:46:18.306 - 00:46:19.948, Speaker C: No, definitely covered it. Thanks so much.
00:46:20.034 - 00:46:30.496, Speaker A: I love that concept of like, wait, what the fuck are we talking about? Like interoperability is just like a new synonym for what should just be called easy or useful. Right? I love the answer.
00:46:30.598 - 00:46:44.292, Speaker B: Just like friction to a customer. It feels like a breaking of the promise. And in a way we're not that far from fixing it all, but we're still going to take six months, a year minimum of pretty conservative build.
00:46:44.346 - 00:46:44.950, Speaker E: Sorry.
00:46:45.560 - 00:46:49.012, Speaker G: Hi Rohan. Fascinating company, developer Labs.
00:46:49.076 - 00:46:49.384, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:46:49.422 - 00:47:49.032, Speaker G: The journey is incredible. Maybe I would like to ask you perhaps it's a reflection of what you have seen in the past two cycles that we have of NFTs and how the past cycle. Most of the NFT projects, they were based on the Crypto Bank model of 10,000 and now they are kind of like as opposed of your model of the CryptoKitties now that you have, I guess around 2 million CryptoKitties right now. So there are two different models. And I would like to ask you for your opinion about how you see I mean, of course they perlas evolve it right the company. But how you see these new companies that they are kind of like stuck into this model of scarcity or the Ten K how do you see them evolving or keeping creating the nacqua effect without increasing supply? Yeah, just your opinion about that?
00:47:49.166 - 00:49:10.724, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think the master class there is I think you guys done a really great job of saying, well, hey, we're going to limit the supply of the actual NFTs, but we're going to build a big brand around the assets. And I think Doodles is exactly kind of on that same track where the supply of the original NFTs is constricted, but they're building tools that let millions more people potentially engage with the brand. And I think that whether it's through gaming experiences, whether it's through sort of different kinds of cheaper mechanics, whether it's through kind of more the path you guys taking with experiences, et cetera, I mean, Doodle is doing the same as well. I think that that's one approach to sort of keeping the original supply constricted, but being able to engage more and more and more people. I also think that valuation models evolve over time. Like right now, the valuation model for and it's evolving, but very much during this last cycle, the valuation model for most NFT traders or investors was, hey, floor price, mint count. That's usually the thing, right? What's the floor price? What's the mint count? And so for a CryptoKitties or an NBA TOPSHOT, it's a very tough sort of place to be because we're always been focused on, hey, the cheap trading card is worth nothing, the expensive trading card is worth something.
00:49:10.724 - 00:50:02.868, Speaker B: And in fact, you need that sort of variance in order to have in order to make the special things feel special, but also have the ability for people to just play with it for fun. It's okay for people to have five things that are worth nothing. That still brings joy to someone, you know what I mean? And that's a fundamental sort of part of our philosophy where it's not enough for us to say, hey, we're going to but I think that communicating that is more complex. We haven't done the best job. We haven't even put until recently, we haven't taken the right steps to put limits on sort of the high end of our economy and all that stuff. I think that what the team is going to roll out with sort of TOPSHOT 2.0, where basically all of the Dapper last projects, TOPSHOT, NFL and then the ones that we haven't announced yet are going to relaunch as sort of fully mobile, native mobile first kind of experiences throughout this year.
00:50:02.868 - 00:50:55.736, Speaker B: Top shot first and then all day before the next season. And the goal is to bring a new scarcity model in which says, hey, yeah, you can play around with this stuff. These are cheap cars, these are cheap packs. And then these are the very expensive sort of they're a class of asset that has clearly defined rules not just today, but also far into the future. And so you can sort of have both things exist in parallel and they're designed not to cannibalize each other that's how I think the space will evolve in the future because that reflects more how things are in the real world, right? In almost every collectible class you have the low end things people play with and you have the high end. And if digital ownership evolves to being beyond collectibles and it's really a tool for self expression, then most self expression actually happens for free, right? It's today's social media. Right.
00:50:55.736 - 00:51:38.150, Speaker B: So what does digital ownership mean in that context? I think it's still too early to think about that because the number of real wallets in existence that are here for non speculative reasons is very small. So until we grow that, it's almost like we shouldn't sort of get too aggressive with supply would be my advice for sort of NFT economists in a way. And every new project will attract speculative demand and just make sure that you're separating, hey, this demand is speculative and that's fine, that's natural. This demand is sort of fundamental and it's kind of the kind of thing I would imagine my user base being full of five years in the future. Ten years in the future.
00:51:38.840 - 00:52:16.640, Speaker G: Yeah. Thank you for your answer. Maybe this is a tough question, but what do you think about or you have an opinion about how Yuga Labs is actually because it seems to me like they pair maybe it's kind of like from the last cycle. It was the biggest company that came out of NFTs and now this second cycle like Ugalabs were born and is a very important company. What they are doing right now is they are increasing. They are coming out with the coders the other days. So the supply is already I don't know what is the number, but it's maybe like a 200,000 assets, but they are keeping the value.
00:52:16.640 - 00:52:26.710, Speaker G: It's kind of like high. They managed to do that. So what do you think about our prediction? Or what do you think how they are going to evolve or how do you see it?
00:52:29.320 - 00:53:49.150, Speaker B: I'm rooting for those guys. I think it's a really cool I'm rooting for everybody in the space because at the end of the day we are so friggin early that anyone that wins will bring more people, more sort of water into the whole space and rising tide lifts all and I think they're taking an approach that's the gucci stuff it's all very interesting now still. You sort of say to an average individual, hey, come participate. And these are all the things, test that out for yourself in terms of how much it makes sense to what group of user. But I think that it's just really important for us all to take that kind of collaborative mindset of like we're in such an early phase in the ecosystem that let's learn from each other, right? And have that experiment run and be awesome and have that company be huge and successful and there's so much space for others because we're still kind of barely scratching the surface of adoption. I mean, 200,000 these numbers in the scale of consumer Internet are minuscule, right? They're surrounding error on a daily usage of an obscure feature buried in the settings page on Instagram. Right.
00:53:49.150 - 00:54:03.830, Speaker B: You know what I'm saying? It's just too early to sort of say, oh, this is right, this is wrong. It's kind of like, yeah, let's do it all and let's see what excites people and what's real and let's double down on that.
00:54:04.200 - 00:54:05.110, Speaker G: Thank you.
00:54:07.160 - 00:54:07.524, Speaker C: Hi.
00:54:07.562 - 00:54:53.904, Speaker H: Thanks. I'm Jana. We're building Kiki, which is a beauty brand on chain. So we're one of the few people in the room building a consumer product. And you build both consumer as well as applications as well as services, and you also raised a lot of capital. So my question for you as a CEO is where do you think that there's a best return on capital? How do you think about capital allocation and where you think you can create most value from consumer brand on chain versus services versus building flow or other sort of infrastructure things? And how do you advise that entrepreneurs at this stage of crypto think about that from a consumer brand perspective? Do you think it's important we have our own tech, and how do you think about that?
00:54:54.022 - 00:55:20.520, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I mean, my number one thing would be you got to do what's right for you. And that's not like a Dr. Seuss thing. You need that founder product market fit, right? If it's not the right product for you, then you'll always be kind of just not in the right sort of headspace for us. I'm kind of add as hell. So it's always been natural to sort of have a leg in two fronts. But the teams are very focused.
00:55:20.520 - 00:56:20.690, Speaker B: The studio teams are focused on all the application stuff, and then the platform teams do the platform things. Flow is just its own separate beast and has been for a while, and Dieter runs it. Everyone in there can have a uni sort of focused mindset, and I think that's really important. Where is the biggest return on capital? I think, again, for us, what we are best at is saying, what can we do for the mainstream customer? And there's so few people focus on that mission, or at least like building the products for those people to use that. That's still the best place for us to play in. And compared to other teams in crypto, we have the capacity to go way lower in the stack, but in a sense, you don't want to. And the NBA TOPSHOT, like the NBA TOPSHOT team, they have access to levers that they can just pull.
00:56:20.690 - 00:56:49.892, Speaker B: If they need to work on a smart contract, they need to sort of escalate that. That's a whole separate abstraction layer. So even in our own company, we sort of try to keep people very focused and enable people. Higher up the stack to be able to move fast without having to sort of daily struggle with the abstraction layers. My advice would be you just need to understand every piece that you're building on. It's very challenging to build every piece yourself. It's not healthy.
00:56:49.892 - 00:57:20.064, Speaker B: And it is actually the number one kind of thing a CEO should resist from their CTO, right? And it's funny coming from someone who let my CTO build a new programming language, but you don't know what the tension was to get to that point. And we built so many smart contracts and solidity before we finally decided, okay, we need to sort of bite the bullet. But that's usually not a good decision. Like 99.99% of the time it's the wrong decision 99.99% of the time. And you think you're the investor, you can back me up.
00:57:20.064 - 00:57:53.660, Speaker B: You want to kind of iterate quickly. You want to be able to find product market fit without having to spend six months on the next big technological, like you publish a standard but no one uses your product. Your investor is not going to be very happy about that. You know what I mean? In terms of building a platform for customers, just make sure there's demand there, right? And so make sure the market's big enough, make sure the market's mature. Make sure that because it's very hard to then build a platform, no one's there to want it. And then now you have to pivot to building apps on top of the platform. And it's the different DNA is challenging.
00:57:53.660 - 00:58:29.384, Speaker B: We study Netflix a lot in the early days because that's like a studio. How do you create kind of original content but then also run it on a globally scalable platform that has a huge portion of the Internet's bandwidth and you just have to keep those cultures they're somewhat separate. Like the craziness of let's build game mechanics and all that stuff is just different from the and test everything every day, know, move fast, break things, it doesn't matter is just different than the stability of okay, well a simple economic shift here could mean hundreds of millions of dollars of value being lost or whatever it is.
00:58:29.582 - 00:58:30.568, Speaker H: Thank you.
00:58:30.734 - 00:58:32.472, Speaker E: Hi Rohan, thanks for being here.
00:58:32.526 - 00:58:33.000, Speaker B: All good.
00:58:33.070 - 00:59:05.190, Speaker E: I have a question around, let's say, what would be the ideal business model on top of, let's say, all of this concept of digital ownership? We had a talk this morning about royalties and NFT marketplaces. I wonder what you think about that, especially because you're focused on consumer and outside of crypto there's so many business models. Once you create enough demand, like in gaming, in esport, you can always empower creators, et cetera. So just wondering how you think about that.
00:59:06.120 - 01:00:06.648, Speaker B: Well, in a sense, I don't think people have figured out the ideal business model. I think the good thing in crypto has been the average revenue per user is so high that typically just focus on getting users and the revenue is there in terms of consumer facing products. One expression, one of our board members, Hamilton Helmer, he's like this big strategy guy but he always says the rudder doesn't work if the ship isn't moving. So just focus on getting the ship moving and then you can navigate in different places. So growth is maybe more important than and building stuff people want is more important than okay, which part of the value stack am I going to capture right now? We spend maybe too much time thinking about the part of the value stack and that's primarily why we like to stay close to the user. Because at the end of the day, if you're close to the user then everything else has to go through you. And so at the end of the day you could swap out any piece of it.
01:00:06.648 - 01:00:50.692, Speaker B: But if you own the user's trust then they have to go through. But at the same time you could say that about, hey, if you're stripe and you just get to scale and you provide the best in class little widget that everyone needs, then that's also fantastic too. So it kind of goes back to founder product market fit of just built something that I think you and your team are really well suited for. But I think this early on in crypto just builds stuff people want and the monetization is off the charts, right? You sort of have to slow it down rather than speed up. This is not true on B two B because most B, two B in crypto is like people getting paid to do stuff on top of platforms that's sometimes a little tougher, right. Or people raising venture capital to sort of fund growth. But that's also fine.
01:00:50.692 - 01:01:39.590, Speaker B: And it's been seen in different platform shifts before where again you're building stuff that makes the developers lives easy. You're probably offering it for free or cheap to start with and then as those developers become bigger and bigger and bigger then you offer enterprise plans and this sort of thing. But my thing has just been stay close to the customer and then the closest thing to the customer is figuring out making how to make the customer an owner. Right. At the end of the day, if you can tokenize and for real, not for bullshit, but have the actual product and service you're providing be a protocol rather than a company and your customer has a piece of it that's sort of nirvana. And it's very challenging because of a million reasons and regulatory being a big part of them. And not that many people have sort of cracked that nut either.
01:01:39.590 - 01:01:56.440, Speaker B: And who knows if that's the ideal business model either, right? Things evolve pretty of we're still keeping our bets open, all three layers of the stack.
01:01:56.780 - 01:01:57.690, Speaker E: Thank you.
01:01:58.380 - 01:02:06.750, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much again for your time. Everyone please join me in thanking Rom again. Close.
