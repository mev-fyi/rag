00:00:00.480 - 00:00:25.417, Speaker A: Mike, what are you building? I am the founding engineer of Helio, which is the biggest payments processor on Solana. So we're actually building something for the hacker house. You can create a pay link on Helio. You can sell whatever you want. You know, T shirts, jeans, and you can sell them directly on X. It uses the new technology Blinks, which basically inserts HTML into X. And it allows you to basically pay on X directly with Phantom.
00:00:25.417 - 00:00:28.545, Speaker A: Wow. This is super cool. I definitely got to try it out. Thank you so much. Thanks.
