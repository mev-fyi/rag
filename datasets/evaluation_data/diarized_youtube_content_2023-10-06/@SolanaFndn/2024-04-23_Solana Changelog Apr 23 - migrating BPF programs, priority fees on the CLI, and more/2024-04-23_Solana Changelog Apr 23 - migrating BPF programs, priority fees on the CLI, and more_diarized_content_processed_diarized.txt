00:00:03.760 - 00:00:10.105, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Gm gm. Welcome to the Changelog. I'm Nick from the Solana Foundation Devrel team and today with me is Jacob. How you doing, Jacob?
00:00:10.225 - 00:00:11.449, Speaker B: Doing well. How are you doing?
00:00:11.577 - 00:00:17.249, Speaker A: I'm doing amazing. Just got back from Paris Blockchain week. Had a great time and now I'm ready for this changelog. It's going to be so good.
00:00:17.377 - 00:00:18.125, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:00:18.425 - 00:00:47.873, Speaker A: Let's go ahead and dive in. First thing I want to shout out is radiancedao. Radiancedao is actually putting on the Bonkathon. So it's a hackathon going for a couple of weeks starting on April 29th and it's all focused around Bonk and expanding the Bonk ecosystem, which is really cool. But it's a community driven hackathon and one of the extra cool things is we love Colosseum here. We love all things hackathons. There's actually a continuation track sponsored by the Solana foundation for anyone who submitted a project for the Coliseum hackathon.
00:00:47.873 - 00:00:55.931, Speaker A: There's a continuation track with additional prizes that are part of the Bonkathon hackathon and it's just amazing. I love it.
00:00:56.113 - 00:01:36.365, Speaker B: Yeah. So definitely if you are you participate in the Coliseum hackathon, you can also contend your project and enter into the Bonkathon. Moving on to this proposal, this week we have SIMD140 which is migrating the config program to CoreBPF. So there's going to be a lot of these different SIMDs that are going to be migrating a native program into core bpf. It just makes it easier for future client maintainers to just use the BPF binary instead of having to write out the native program itself. But there's something that actually both of us, I think learned today about the config program. The config program is a native program that's used to basically store binary data on chain.
00:01:36.365 - 00:02:15.761, Speaker B: It can be any type of data. What this is mainly used for, from what I can tell from the Explorer, then transactions that are interacting with the config program is setting your validator info. I didn't know exactly what this did and if you deny it to. It's used for updating validator info, but the SIMD will be migrating it to core BPF. And then speaking of SIMDs, there was SIMD 96 that got approved and pulled in I think a couple months ago. So this PR right here is to work on actually creating the implementation of it, of collecting and reward the full priority fee to the validator. So it's added as a feature Gate.
00:02:15.761 - 00:02:22.357, Speaker B: It's been implemented and now we just need to wait for it to be activated on mainnet. What other commits have you seen this week?
00:02:22.541 - 00:02:50.385, Speaker A: There were a couple of commits related to CLI things Specifically, huge shout out to John Shinque as always. He went through and added a bunch of updates within the Solana CLI to have more flexibility and usability for all things priority fees and compute units. So some of the arguments you can actually like pass an argument to set custom. You can set arguments to actually customize what your priority fee is going to be when you're doing different things, including program deploys, which is really nice.
00:02:50.705 - 00:03:21.835, Speaker B: Yeah, it's always good to see more adoption of this within the cli. I wish it came earlier because it's definitely new now, but I'm happy to see it. On our Resources of the Week we have a couple of resources. The first one is the Solana Mobile Expo template. So if anybody's building like a mobile application and they want to use Expo, this can get you up and running very quickly. This is just like a template. If you're familiar with the Solana dapp, what is it Solana Create D app that we have, this is for Expo.
00:03:21.835 - 00:03:30.479, Speaker B: You can use this as basically a scaffold to get you started. And then there's also anchor 30 which is a big change.
00:03:30.607 - 00:03:33.239, Speaker A: Oh yeah, this is a good one. Long time in the making.
00:03:33.367 - 00:04:11.145, Speaker B: Yeah, this comes with a bunch of different changes that are a lot of them devex experience changes. Yeah, there's improvements to the IDL to make it more capable and able to basically expand or extend later. There is some changes in like dependency free program declaration. So if you've had issues with like, hey, you're importing another program, it has all these extra dependencies now. You don't have to worry about that. So this is a huge change in itself. You have token extension improvements, you have compatibility, you have the interface attribute, you have a bunch of different things.
00:04:11.145 - 00:04:20.203, Speaker B: So definitely check out the full release notes. It's pretty huge. But yeah, that's anchor 30 and then stack Exchange.
00:04:20.259 - 00:04:34.615, Speaker A: Let's talk about Stack Exchange. We love Stack Exchange. Shout out to some of the people on Stack Exchange from last week that have been crushing it. Ari is on the top of that list. We've got Acheron on there and some of the other common people that you see around Stack Exchange. Amazing work to everybody.
00:04:34.955 - 00:05:09.431, Speaker B: Yes, please do contribute back to Stack Exchange. There's a lot of new developers every week currently. I think There was like 600 new developers signing up for Stack Exchange just last week, which is like 5% of the total, total users on Stack Exchange, on our Stack Exchange. So please do help out with it. Yeah, so 500, just like 12,000 users, it's a decent percentage just signed up last week, or 600. So please do help out, sign up, help out, answer questions, upvote good answers and questions and move on. But that's all we got for y'all this week on the change log.
00:05:09.431 - 00:05:12.367, Speaker B: And I hope you all see us next week. Adios.
00:05:12.431 - 00:05:12.975, Speaker A: Catch you next time.
