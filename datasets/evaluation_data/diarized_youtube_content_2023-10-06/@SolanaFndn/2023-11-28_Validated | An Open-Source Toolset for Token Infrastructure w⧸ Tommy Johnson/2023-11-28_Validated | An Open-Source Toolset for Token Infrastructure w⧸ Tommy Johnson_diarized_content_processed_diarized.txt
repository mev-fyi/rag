00:00:00.200 - 00:01:05.224, Speaker A: Just a quick note before we begin today. This episode is recorded in mid October, which is before breakpoint, before the recent market rally, before the renewed interest, excitement and attention that the Solana ecosystem is getting. But this conversation and the tools that Armada and Sci-Fi have built out are really important to focus on. I think now more than ever, going into these more raucous market cycles, this is something where the fundamentals really matter and the tools that groups like Armada have built out that can help people do sustainable and well thought out. Token launches become even more important when more noise enters the ecosystem, more tourists enter the ecosystem. And so if the tone and tenor of this conversation feels a little depressed at times, I think that's because it does reflect how people were feeling in the beginning of October, that we needed tools like this for whenever the market decides to come back. And we may be in that cycle, we may not be in that cycle, and that's why this conversation is still relevant today.
00:01:05.224 - 00:01:15.744, Speaker A: Tommy, welcome to Validated.
00:01:16.084 - 00:01:17.424, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:17.764 - 00:01:39.314, Speaker A: Yeah, excited for this one today. There's a bunch we can talk about. I want to talk about bit about your journey into the space and sort of your journey into building stuff on Solana. Let's talk about site options. I want to talk about Armada as well. Let's start out with you. Give me a little bit of your background and sort of how you got into this crazy world.
00:01:40.414 - 00:02:12.148, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we have to go back to 2016. When I first started really getting into crypto, started doing some part time smart contract development on Ethereum. Never really went full time there, didnt have anything take off. Started paying attention to Solana after Multicoin, was tweeting about it in 2018, and shortly after Solana went to Mainnet in 2020, I started diving into just hacking around and getting some refs with some code. That was the beginning of how I really got sucked into Solana.
00:02:12.316 - 00:02:25.582, Speaker A: What was that unlock for you going from? Oh, im like playing around and stuff on Ethereum, but I don't feel like this is something I necessarily want to dive into full time. To looking at Solana and saying like, yeah, actually this is something I want to do full time.
00:02:25.758 - 00:02:58.884, Speaker B: There was never this. This is what I want to do full time. I was always super interested in blockchain. Um, I think timing was good with Solana. I had really grown as an engineer and was a team lead in my day job, and so I could really build anything start to finish and wanted to hack on something new. I had the pain points of developing with solidity on Ethereum and the speed of the blockchain and seeing what Solana promised. That's what brought me, really, to just focusing on Solana in my spare time, bootlegging some projects.
00:02:58.884 - 00:03:09.652, Speaker B: But what really took me full time was winning a hackathon. The first Solana Defi hackathon in February of, I believe that was 2021.
00:03:09.708 - 00:03:10.344, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:11.204 - 00:03:31.628, Speaker B: Yeah. I had no plans to go full time. We built just options, an options primitive and took first place. And all of a sudden, investors are reaching out, looking to invest. And so then we had to set up a business entity and raise funds and all that fun stuff, and that's what really kind of pushed us to jump full at time.
00:03:31.716 - 00:03:56.384, Speaker A: Yeah, it's such a wild moment to go back to, like, those early days of 2021 when basically no one knew about Solana still at that point. I joined in January of 21. It was still very unknown at that point. And so talk to me a little bit about that hackathon process. Back before these. If folks are familiar with Solana hackathons now, they're an experience. They're a whole production.
00:03:56.384 - 00:04:20.764, Speaker A: I think the highest number of attendees in any web3 hackathon is the, you know, the one the Slana foundation runs three times a year. But this was only the second hackathon that Slana had done. This was the first official one. The first one was that wormhole Defi v zero hackathon that was sort of cobbled together, but this was the first serious one. What was that process like of going through that?
00:04:21.264 - 00:04:51.540, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, I was also a part of the one in November, the very, very first one that wasn't even. That was just very hacked together, but didn't place. I mean, my brother and I, we submitted a. Our submission was we built a trusted third party oracle. So it's kind of like the very basic building blocks of what switchboard is today. And our presentation was just printing out on, like, a terminal, and so, like, no ui, nothing sexy. So, of course, we didn't place.
00:04:51.540 - 00:05:19.144, Speaker B: It was more developer tooling and just getting used to it. But that was a fun learning experience. But so then once the next one was. Was announced, it was definitely a lot more put together, a little bit less chaotic in terms of getting help and, you know, resources from the Solana discord and the community and actually Solana Labs members. And there was actually presentations. I remember there was. And it was a lot.
00:05:19.144 - 00:05:41.594, Speaker B: There was a lot less noise. Right. I remember, um, you know, some of the Solana Labs developers giving a few core presentations on how to write a simple, smart contract, or, I mean, just doing more office, like an office hour here and there. But it wasn't as scheduled and robust. It was more of like, hey, I'm. I'm down to host an office hour. So it was.
00:05:41.594 - 00:05:55.026, Speaker B: It was definitely an interesting, um, you know, time, but it was also very, like. I would say the community was much more intimate. Like, it. You have a lot more close connections, a lot less noise back then. Yeah.
00:05:55.050 - 00:06:39.750, Speaker A: It's also funny to think that was back in the time when there were so few projects that they could all be manually reviewed by just a few people. Yeah, I think there was like. Yeah, that initial. I mean, one of the crazy stats that I was talking with Maddie about, the first one was like, I think six weeks after Matty was hired, and this one that you were in was the first real one that he ran. But I think it was something along the lines of the projects that won that first one in November that you guys first entered, they wouldn't even place. Nowadays, for the most part, in the hackathon, the quality has increased so dramatically in what we've seen there. And so that's kind of cool to hear about the early days of what that one was like for you guys.
00:06:39.750 - 00:07:04.674, Speaker A: Yeah, we're basically just about two years past that at this point. Now, as we're sitting here today recording, I want to get into some of the stuff you guys have been doing recently and sort of this announcement around Armada. It feels like the last maybe three months, stuff has started really heating back up in Defi. But the previous almost year before that was a pretty sleepy time. What have you guys been working on?
00:07:05.494 - 00:08:18.998, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, sleepy time for the marketing and growth people, but for us engineers, it's like, there's less noise, it's easier to build. So, for us, I mean, armada came about because psy finance, formerly psyoptions and hero, were chatting. We were just talking about the pain points we'd seen with launching a token and getting liquidity on those tokens, and governance and everything under the sun of like, okay, you have this token outside of your business and the core protocol or programs you're building, there's all this other infrastructure to get from. We have a protocol to decentralized organization and tokenomics and governance driven tokenomics, which is very important. And then there was teams that were reaching out to a few groups that were saying, hey, we want to launch a token, but there's this infrastructure on Ethereum, but it doesn't exist on Solana. That's where we started, was like, hey, let's build this infrastructure for these teams who are going to want to launch tokens and build a liquidity bootstrapping curve. Basically an auction mechanism where price can start high and if no one's buying, it goes lower.
00:08:18.998 - 00:09:00.461, Speaker B: But when people buy, the price jumps up. So there's this auction mechanism that has price discovery in it. And then, well, once you have a token, what else do you do with debt? Well, you need to get liquidity on the token, otherwise you have no ecosystem. If there's no liquidity, why are people going to be holding this thing? If they want to be able to get out? In and out, there needs to be liquidity. So that's step two of a token, is getting liquidity and incentivizing that. Everything we just announced with Arbada is those core components helping teams launch tokens, helping teams get robust liquidity on tokens, and incentivizing those liquidity, that liquidity.
00:09:00.637 - 00:09:52.104, Speaker A: So it felt like we went from an era in like early 2021 where it was like, oh, you go to white paper, launch a token to sort of a late 2022 market where it was very much like, are you sure you want to launch a token? Should you actually be doing this? Like, have you thought this through? I mean, like, classic example is something like apecoin. Like, what is it? Therefore, what does it do? Why does it exist? And that was a very different market than sort of the area that you sort of came up in. Um, yeah. So walk me through a little bit about that conversation with Armada thinking, like, you know what, people actually need tools to launch tokens better. Like what, what is, what has changed? Um, in the view of this sort of coalition that came together to build this thing to be like, nah, like, we, we can do token launches again. In fact, we actually should be doing them.
00:09:53.124 - 00:10:52.060, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think there's, there's a lot of good organizations that have built, um, platforms that are still getting some sort of traction in the bear market or continue to build platforms that are going to get traction as interest rates change and the macro environment changes. And so there's always going to be a need to launch tokens. And so how do you building the infrastructure to do that in a fair way, in a decentralized way? I mean, the infrastructure we're building, this is not a launch pad. We have to make that clear. This is like software. We're just handing over uis that can be customized with the team's branding and they self host it. So we just kind of rethought, like, we don't want to do a launchpad because I think back in the heyday of 2021, like launchpads were scammy, but that was that environment, right? Everyone wanted to like ape into the next thing and so everyone would pay attention to the launchpads.
00:10:52.060 - 00:11:28.316, Speaker B: But this is definitely a more thoughtful approach. Just like the current environment where people are being more thoughtful of whether they should and should not launch tokens. I don't think there's a million tokens out there. There doesn't need to be a million more. So I think tokens can kind of create noise in determining whether you have product market fit and things like that. But they're also good mechanisms for incentivizing and creating a community. So you have to really weigh your goals and current market conditions and current community and what they want out of it and what the core development team wants out of it, et cetera.
00:11:28.460 - 00:11:58.124, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean one of the token challenges has always been that it puts a lot of pressure on the team to focus on something that maybe they're actually not focused on. Right. It's the same thing about like not to equate tokens to equity, but when a startup goes public, you actually generally see them getting worse. Right. Most publicly traded companies are worse run than privately held companies, and that's not an accident. That's because every quarter number go up or else like bored get fired. Right.
00:11:58.124 - 00:12:24.674, Speaker A: And there is a component of crypto where if you launch a token too early, it can. Well, not too early is a hard way to say it, but if you launch a token early, it is hard to figure out what that, what the reason for that token is and not necessarily that the founders haven't figured that out. It's that the external pressures come at you pretty strong and that can totally change the dynamic of what a project is actually designed to do.
00:12:24.794 - 00:13:29.222, Speaker B: Totally. I mean, case in point, psy options and that token. Right. I mean we spent, we went from focusing, I mean we have two contributing teams now and one still very heavily focused on like structured products and, and options and stuff. But the whole other contributing team that I'm a part of, we started focusing on like, well, how do we spin up governance and getting involved in SPL governance and realms and writing programs for like treasury management and contributing to the voter stake registry, because you need certain like you have this design that you want to meet with how the community gets involved and whatnot. So like, yeah, it is a huge distraction and I think that definitely, I mean, for us, clearly we had to split priorities and so the goal of Armada is to just take all the learnings and the time that we spent so that the next group of organizations launching tokens don't have to think about this stuff. It's all kind of out of the box for them.
00:13:29.358 - 00:14:02.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to spend some time on that in a minute, digging into what that split was like, quite frankly, how that was structured, how you guys came about making those decisions. But before we get into that, what is the framework that Armada operates under in terms of its sustainability over the long term? Because I think you look at the launch pads and the idea there was always, well, we'll take a certain percentage of token supply and if we have enough volume through, we'll have enough money. At the end of the day, this thing works out. And the problem with launchpads is they were always incentivized for volume over quality.
00:14:03.034 - 00:14:03.434, Speaker B: Yep.
00:14:03.474 - 00:14:07.014, Speaker A: So how is armada structured financially at that point?
00:14:08.034 - 00:15:16.372, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that just like the product, like the financial model, we will iterate on that. But what we're going to market with is we have the concentrated liquidity market making vaults, which is where users and projects and teams can kind of delegate liquidity after a token is launched to an institutional market maker that just has certain permissions to manage positions on an underlying concentrated liquidity pool. Currently, orcas whirlpools. And so there will be fees taken from trading volumes there. And so it really, to go back to your question of how do you go quality over quantity? You want quality trading volume over a sustainable amount of time, and you're not going to just push out a million projects that are going to, you know, trade for a day and then do nothing like you want. You want projects that are building real infrastructure that's going to be around for a while and are building quality tokenomics models or quality ecosystems with flywheels that is going to create more sustainable volumes over time. And so that's kind of where we're really diving in with these teams.
00:15:16.468 - 00:15:47.834, Speaker A: Yeah. So I know you are not a lawyer, but I do want to ask a little bit about the legal structure that this is all done under, because there's a fine line between making tools to make, making markets easier and stuff that begins to raise the hackles of, if not regulators and at least a team's internal legal folks being like, wait a minute, we have to figure out exactly where this money that we're contributing to this vault goes for. So how did you guys get comfortable with basically building those types of tools?
00:15:48.754 - 00:16:26.830, Speaker B: Lots of legal bills. That's the answer, right. If you're not a lawyer, that's the answer. But no, I mean, we also have, I mean, I'll dive into entity structure. I think it's interesting for teams that are launching and want to launch how they handle things, but there's an offshore foundation which then has service agreements with onshore, like tech or service providers, right? Yeah. And so that offshore foundation is set up by lawyers and core contributors, not team members of that. We had all that set up in 2021.
00:16:26.830 - 00:17:11.950, Speaker B: Granted, regulation is constantly changing and whether some paperwork and all these other things really shield you is clearly up in the air. So we're very thoughtful with the risks that we're taking, but we also know different teams have different risk profiles. And so that's where the way we've kind of built this platform from the ground up is. So that way teams can deploy their own sites on their own subdomains and they can put whatever restrictions that they want in front of their users. They can run whatever auction styles that they want. So it's something where we pay attention to this stuff all the time. I mean, the ripple stuff is very interesting for pool based token launches.
00:17:11.950 - 00:17:17.262, Speaker B: Right. But it's like constantly changing. So lots of legal pills.
00:17:17.358 - 00:17:18.194, Speaker A: That's fair.
00:17:18.734 - 00:17:20.182, Speaker B: So I want to go back to.
00:17:20.198 - 00:17:40.774, Speaker A: Something you were alluding to earlier, which is that the launch of a token for you guys actually necessitated such a work stream split that you ended up basically creating two separate core contributor organizations. Walk me through a little bit about what that conversation was like when you were saying, hey, we actually kind of need to break this up into a few different entities.
00:17:41.314 - 00:18:29.484, Speaker B: Yeah, well, so the decision was never about, like, we need a separate entity, but when we actually, we acquired tap finance to run structured products for like the Sci-Fi Dao back in January of 2022. And so they're a group out of Singapore and they kind of host all the site finance stuff and the engineering behind that. And so they were working on a lending product at the time and we had some contributors from the US team working on that as well. But the core focus was on that lending and structured products. But as we were launching a token in January 2022 and handling all the legal work for them. Great time to launch token. Oh, yeah, you look at the chart, it's very great time.
00:18:29.484 - 00:19:23.040, Speaker B: But okay, back to the decisions on splitting. So we were so focused on the token and then, well, once you launch a token, what do you do with that token? So you kind of need to go through like, all right, well, we need governance. Why do we need governance, we need tokenomics. And so you kind of have this whole, you kind of have to get going on, like building all that infrastructure so your community and token holders have things to do that actually impact and drive the ecosystem. Otherwise, like your governance token is a gimmick. And most, I mean, to date, most governance tokens are gimmicks to the apecoin. What are you doing with it? So it just came about, our group was focused a lot on the token launch and getting that ready, and Singapore group was just heads down, still working on the structured products and lending stuff.
00:19:23.040 - 00:19:38.902, Speaker B: So it just naturally came about that, hey, we're going to contribute to the governance infrastructure because we want our communities asking for x, y and z functionality in realms and all that kind of stuff. But those kind of came pretty fairly naturally.
00:19:38.998 - 00:20:16.564, Speaker A: Right. It's obviously spinning up a second team or staffing a second team focused on this type of work. It's not cheap and it's not necessarily directly related. I mean, it's one of those things where it's operationally related to running the core protocol, but it is not directly financially related to that core protocol. So quite frankly, there's a treasury allocation perspective. What was that like when you guys are like, oh man, we actually need to build a lot of these tools and it's going to be expensive and it's not necessarily going to make our core financial products any stronger.
00:20:17.224 - 00:20:42.930, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think a lot of it comes from community need. It's not going to make the financial product stronger, but it could make the community stronger. Granted, when you're fighting against a bear market and things are just going down and FTX bankruptcy and three arrows, never heard of it and Luna crashing. Yeah, exactly. Right. So you have a lot of headwinds against you and you're building this infrastructure.
00:20:42.930 - 00:21:37.054, Speaker B: You've been building this infrastructure for community, but community is just going out of the entire ecosystem. You know, it's a failed bet, but there's a lot of learnings along the way, I think. So, I mean, as far as it is expensive to like contribute there and you apply. We applied for some grants and got some grants from the Solana foundation, but those grants, they don't cover the cost of engineering, right? They don't cover like cost of audits, it's more of a subsidy. But, you know, this is infrastructure like that the entire ecosystem needs, and we're just viewing it some as more public goods and they become more top of the funnel for other projects downstream. We've had teams just with our governance infrastructure and knowledge from contributing there. Teams have reached out asking how we set up the voter stake registry and how we set up realms and asking for demos and all that kind of stuff.
00:21:37.054 - 00:22:12.356, Speaker B: So it definitely helps a little bit with the branding and recognition inside the ecosystem, but. But it is definitely not, I think, like if we didn't pivot or not pivot, but if we didn't also work on like, Armada, it would be a lot of like sunk costs. So that's why hopefully, you know, Armada can take that away from others. I mean, it's, it's at least, I think. I think if I actually did the accounting, I get probably in the approaching seven figures on the investment into like governance and tokenomics related stuff.
00:22:12.460 - 00:22:49.134, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's one of the great things about seeing Armada is like, there's not a bunch of folks who have made a bet to say we're going to build tooling for this stuff, and then also we're going to basically take that and if not, make it free and make it incredibly accessible for folks to be able to sort of access, like at a time when there's a lot of teams that are sort of clamping down and saying, like, we actually might want to take some stuff closed source because were worried about someone taking this. What kind of got you guys, as a collective comfortable saying, we actually want to just fully launch this in public as opposed to trying to keep it by some sort of tight access?
00:22:50.634 - 00:23:15.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we've been burned in the past. Before our code was, I don't even know if it was open source or not, I can't remember it. But some contributors, or wanted to be contributors got access to the code and forked it and then we open sourced it. You never know. Right. Like, just poor decisions, whether it's open source or not, can lead to. Lead to people like taking code.
00:23:15.410 - 00:23:51.866, Speaker B: And even then, at the level the ecosystem is now, there's so many quality solana developers that can build smart contracts. If they read a white paper, they can figure out the mechanics and build something else. Right. It's just going to take them time. So I think as the ecosystem grows, it's not so much like the ip that becomes the moat, it's more of your community and liquidity and other aspects of it. So that's where the institutional market making and the skills and partners there is what will kind of create the moat on some of those trading and market making vaults.
00:23:52.010 - 00:24:41.564, Speaker A: Yeah, let's see an interesting point there. So as you're looking at sort of these two skill sets. I'm really fascinated by this one organization that's got these two core teams that are trying to do two very, very different types of things. It's usually hard to balance different stakeholder cultures within an organization. This is the classic example of why a car company spins out their electric car division as its own company and then reacquires it later. Sometimes you just need a certain amount of distance from the culture and the politics of one organization to build something that's kind of radically different. What is that working relationship like with the financial products side of the house? And how do you guys navigate that sort of process of priorities and decision making?
00:24:41.984 - 00:25:21.164, Speaker B: That's a great question. I think it comes down to our governance infrastructure or governance setup too. This is something I think we're doing that's pretty unique, that we don't really talk about too much. In the very beginning, we tried to get a bunch of decentralized contributors and get community to get involved, but that was a waste of money. You get really bad developers, poor designs, things are all scattered. You cannot move at an efficient pace to compete with any sort of centralized or pseudo centralized entity or organization. If you're trying to do everything with individual contributors across the globe, it's really hard to vet them, all that stuff.
00:25:21.164 - 00:26:19.578, Speaker B: Then with the acquisition of tap finance, we create this more decentralized structure than a centralized entity, where there's two individual entities but neither one actually owns the other. But we have good working relationships. We get together once a week to brain share, discuss the ecosystem, discuss what we're currently working on, share resources, engineering resources of, hey, we're getting some traction on silent. We need this feature, we need this UI improvement, whatever. And so there's a little bit more resource sharing as far as contributions to these different repositories. But then there's still the autonomy of individual organizations. And then at a higher level, the kind of council meets at least once a month to kind of discuss any changes to the bigger picture and where we're going.
00:26:19.578 - 00:26:32.084, Speaker B: And that's where we talk about things like Armada and the interest there and how that can be beneficial to the broader Sci-Fi organization. I mean, Sci-Fi is going to be the first one dogfooding most of armada stuff.
00:26:33.144 - 00:26:55.664, Speaker A: So where do you see the right point to sort of bring community in? You touched on the fact that you tried early on to be like, help us build stuff, and that really didn't work. So what have you found as that right balancing act between, like bringing the community in enough, but not so much that now they're actually holding you back from developing new stuff.
00:26:56.604 - 00:27:25.656, Speaker B: That's a great question. I'm not going to pretend to have the answer, but I'll hypothesize here a little bit. I think it depends also on the roles that communities are coming into. I think creating subdals for things like growth in marketing are a little bit easier. Um, and you kind of give a little bit more freedom to a group, um, to make decisions on general community branding, that kind of stuff.
00:27:25.720 - 00:27:26.056, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:26.120 - 00:27:59.074, Speaker B: Um, but, like, I still. I don't know about, like, a bunch of individual contributors that are there for one week and gone the next. Right. Like, it takes a lot to, like, market something to get understand products in and out, to answer questions in discord, to write blog posts, quality blog posts that actually drive value to the reader and all that kind of stuff. You really need that internally. You need someone who's eating and sleeping this stuff, rather than some sort of outsourced group that's juggling 50 different things.
00:27:59.194 - 00:27:59.874, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:00.034 - 00:28:01.694, Speaker B: So it's tough.
00:28:02.074 - 00:28:38.254, Speaker A: I hear you on that. So talk to me a little bit about this sort of subdao and governance model you guys are working on. There's a few folks who I think are doing some interesting work on this. I'd like to get your opinions on, too, which is the work that helium's been doing building out governance infrastructure for their sub networks type product offerings, where mobile and IoT are different subnets. And then the proposal that Roon from maker has had about how you can use the SVM and the Solana code base to actually create daos that actually have the power to even rewind state.
00:28:39.454 - 00:29:58.154, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think subdals are super interesting. I think I was at Osmocon 2022, and they've done a great job with their subdals for marketing and whatnot. And so I think when you give power to a more decentralized group, but a smaller group and delegate, I think it can be very efficient. So I haven't dug into, honestly, helium's like, governance infrastructure stuff, and what we're building right now with Armada, like Fleet V one and Fleet V two, is not even going to touch on, like, setting up subdals and that kind of stuff. I think you could still hack it together with realms and SBL governance, but we're still in the phase of just focusing on some infrastructure and then building out, like, okay, now, now that we have, like, tokenomics, that's governance light, not governance, like, reliable, heavily on governance, voting every time and things like that. Then I think we'll focus on the subdows and actually setting those things up to start delegating different sort of operations out. But I think they're extremely effective because it gets a lot for, if you have.
00:29:58.154 - 00:30:11.854, Speaker B: If your core DaO requires a ton of community voting, it is very hard to get the entire community to come to a vote. And so you're doing that frequently, like, good luck, like, it's not going to happen.
00:30:13.554 - 00:30:28.814, Speaker A: Governance attacks, quite frankly, take advantage of this exact problem where potentially you can slip through a proposal to transfer a bunch of the treasury out and someone might not even notice. Even if you have a, even if you have like a seven day voting waiting period on that.
00:30:29.554 - 00:30:30.194, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:30:30.234 - 00:30:30.648, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:30.746 - 00:31:30.688, Speaker B: Um, yeah. And so you have to be thoughtful of, like, you have to understand the community who can, you know, so you have to be thoughtful of, like, what your vote threshold is set to and whether there's a vote tipping, whether votes can, like, be passed early or not. And so, like, when you're setting up, like, those dows, you'd be very thoughtful of that. So you want to make it restrictive enough that you don't have these adversaries coming in and hacking the DaO, but it needs to be, you know, I guess, low enough that you can actually get votes passed. And so if you move to a model where you're delegating different aspects of the organization to, like, subdaos, you know, you can have different thresholds and parameters for those different daos. So it gives you a little more flexibility and I guess, like, separations of concerns in isolation, which is good for your DAOS security. Like, you know, you can have really restrictive stuff on your treasury management, but, like, for marketing, token weighted marketing stuff, delegate that out to a group or a subdow.
00:31:30.856 - 00:31:38.480, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. So what are you guys actually subdowing at this point right now?
00:31:38.512 - 00:31:38.808, Speaker B: Nothing.
00:31:38.856 - 00:31:39.144, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:39.184 - 00:32:22.478, Speaker B: Honestly, like, we've been, we've been, we haven't put anything into practice. We've just been focused on our, like, the core Sci-Fi dow in infrastructure there. We had some, we made some bets that we invested in treasury management and other integrations into realms, but there's just not a lot of daos actually leveraging all that kind of stuff just yet. Hopefully that changes. So we've been still kind of, like, focusing on revamping tokenomics, which, like, okay, that sounds like an easy task, but once you put everything on chain and you've locked up tokens and grants that are unlocking over like two or three years and.
00:32:22.526 - 00:32:22.896, Speaker A: Sure.
00:32:22.990 - 00:32:47.348, Speaker B: And all that kind of stuff. Like, if you want to make a change, you gotta write code to, like, be able to unlock those without, you know, creating some sort of backdoor or any issues. And then you actually have to, like, get those votes passed and unlock all those grants, and then you can start, you know, creating new daos and subdals or, uh. Or, uh, you know, maybe a staking program. Yeah, which actually, that's. Yeah. So.
00:32:47.436 - 00:33:36.774, Speaker A: So how do you balance that stuff over the long term? Or let me ask, maybe a better version. How is Armada thinking about how folks should structure this over the long term? So, for example, it's very easy to say, oh, everything should be done immutable. But I think, as something like metaplex saw, if you make things immutable from day one, there's a whole bunch you don't know until you actually get into product market fit and product discovery. And the metaplex protocol has changed dramatically since when it first came out. We'd be on like, v 37 at this point if each version that came out were fully locked and couldn't be upgraded. So when you're looking at things like token economics and these other structures, how is Armada recommending? Folks think about when the right time is to do things in an immutable fashion versus a more immutable fashion.
00:33:37.554 - 00:34:29.878, Speaker B: So we've just announced our SPL staking program, which the unique aspect of this is it gives tokenized tokenization representation, tokenized representation of your stake weight. So it can be plugged into SPL governance without being like a direct, without taking over the community vote plug in nature of SPL governance. And so it kind of creates the change that users don't have to decide, do I stake or participate in governance? You're streamlining those two things. And then the other program was the demultiplexer. The demultiplexer can take in fees from any program, and then it has different distribution weights and send those to different actions. It doesn't make any assumptions about the actions on the other end. That one will be pretty easy to pretty.
00:34:29.878 - 00:35:26.200, Speaker B: It will be easily easy to make it immutable, because then you're just building different actions or plugins that plug into the demultiplexer. And those actions can be something like it just simply sends to the governance treasury, or buy a certain token and deposit it into some other program for protocol owned liquidity, or buy some other token or distribute in kind to stakers as like, staking rewards, or distribute to a liquidity mining program. Or liquidity mining incentives. And so the goal is to make all these actions that'll be fleet v three. We're building some actions for the launch of the demultiplexer, but we don't want to make assumptions and we'll let other teams contribute and provide input for what other actions should be built on top of it. Yeah.
00:35:26.272 - 00:35:51.724, Speaker A: At some point, this almost feels like this is going to be a massive undersell, but it's like a business logic construction platform in some regards. You could certainly use this for liquidity incentives and marketing and all these sorts of things. You could also, it sounds like, take a lot of these toolings and say this is actually how we're going to run the back office operations of a protocol that has built in revenue splits.
00:35:52.464 - 00:36:34.578, Speaker B: Yup, exactly. Partnerships on chain. If there's some collaboration, you could do a fee split from those protocols and send them to two different treasuries. Or you could stack these dmux instances and split them and they go to the two organizations dmux instances and just feed into their tokenomics model. And so we're building this UI that has all these puzzle pieces and can display to members what an ecosystems tokenomics layout looks like and where the fees are coming from and where they're going to via the demultiplexer.
00:36:34.626 - 00:36:48.334, Speaker A: Yeah. What's the long term scope of what Armada should encapsulate look like? Where do you draw the line and say, this is in scope and this is out of scope for what this protocol will build?
00:36:49.114 - 00:37:10.038, Speaker B: Great question. Um, a lot of the governance, like, we talked about subdals and things like that, like, we're not touching, uh, any, like, so much related to governance. We're just making a plug into SPL governance and. And realms and things like that. I mean, I think we'll see where realms code base goes. I think that there's a little bit more restrictions on, like third party code and. Yeah, and there's.
00:37:10.038 - 00:37:53.464, Speaker B: There's definitely some like, pain points that could be improved with realms. Uh, so we'll see where that goes. But, like, in the present day, where we are not really touching anything related to token weighted voting, NFT voting governance stuff, we're building the tooling around SPL governance. So that's at least one clear line in the sand TBD on where things go. I mean, we're just letting. Now that we've announced the token launching and the concentrate liquidity market making stuff, we've had a lot of inbound interest from teams and so we're just trying to get really good at assessing the ecosystem needs, those teams needs and building to solve those.
00:37:53.844 - 00:38:01.864, Speaker A: Yeah. Is there like a class of tooling that you think Solana still needs to ten x itself on?
00:38:02.764 - 00:38:15.568, Speaker B: Well, the token launching stuff. Right. That's why we built it. So we need good quality tokens. So token launching and tokenomics. So. But not going to just pump arbadas a little bit there.
00:38:15.568 - 00:38:41.788, Speaker B: But the other stuff, I think there's a lot of good infrastructure, but it's all very disjoint. That's the pain point that armada is trying to solve. You have so many different staking programs, you have governance, all that kind of stuff, but they were very disjoint. But I think there's a lot of infrastructure that just needs to be tweaked a little bit. Governance. The delegation process with SPL governance is rough, to say the least. So it doesn't.
00:38:41.788 - 00:39:23.484, Speaker B: So if you're, you know, there's a lot of VC's and institutions that will not participate in governance whatsoever. Solano ventures won't even participate in governance. Right? So. But like maybe they would be able to delegate, right? Some say they can delegate, some can say they cannot. There's various levels there, but so, like fixing delegation and improving that to make it. Make it easier for. For these groups and token holders that can't participate in governance to delegate to not just one wallet, but many different wallets, and making it easier for those people who are receiving the delegations to actually easily vote with just one go with all those wallets.
00:39:23.484 - 00:39:26.664, Speaker B: That would be a huge, huge improvement.
00:39:26.784 - 00:39:42.266, Speaker A: Yeah. It is interesting how it feels like stuff gets built and then it usually takes a year or two for it to actually get refined, to be usable, to go from the idea of like, it's technically possible to do this, to like, it's practical and actually easy for this thing to be done in real time on the network.
00:39:42.370 - 00:39:50.774, Speaker B: I mean, that's like startups and product and everything in general, right? Like there's just lots of iterations. You need to get feedback and you need to create those feedback loops.
00:39:51.354 - 00:40:21.154, Speaker A: So you guys are building this all sort of for your own needs and you're open sourcing it to community, which is awesome over the long term. What keeps this going besides just another crazy bull market cycle where everyone is suddenly a quadrillionaire again? Do you think there's a model where Armada actually becomes a nonprofit spin out and asks people using it for donations? Or do you think it's just Linux, where it's like, yeah, people just contribute to it as they need.
00:40:21.274 - 00:40:49.258, Speaker B: That's TBD. We floated a few ideas. Some places that take fees and some, some do not, right. The staking is not going to take fees because like who knows? Like there could be pennies going through there and it'd be rude to take fees there but there could be like small transaction fees on like the D multiplexer. So like but nothing that's like makes it restrictive to, for anyone to crank. But so like maybe just doubling the Solana transaction fee right?
00:40:49.306 - 00:40:49.586, Speaker A: Sure.
00:40:49.650 - 00:41:57.160, Speaker B: Of just so many land ports and then the market making vaults those will have performance fees taken out on them. Then the token launching. The LBC doesn't have any fees right now baked into it and so we're viewing it more as a top of the funnel for getting people into providing liquidity on the concentrated liquidity market, making vaults and things like that. So I think the different programs and different uis are going to have different like different models or different roles in this ecosystem and it's still TBD. I mean maybe at some point like the programs are open source but the uis, right like you have to pay for the, to like host the UI or whatnot right? Kind of like I mean what is that discourse right this form of the forum company, things like that. So we have a few ideas but we're just still in like such the early phases of just get people using it and collecting feedback so it becomes the best product and creates a mode in and of itself.
00:41:57.232 - 00:42:42.204, Speaker A: Yeah so Armada is a series of tools and tooling to make certain activities a lot easier on chain at some point that sort of begs the question of is this a services company or is this a GitHub repo? What do you think is the right sort of path there? Because at some level unless youre charging a subscription it would be pretty crazy if I could call someone up and be like hey im having trouble using this toolkit but at some level that is what is expected from the entire world of SaaS today, which are software tools to make things that you could do yourself but you probably shouldnt do yourself a lot easier. Do you see this as a long term SAS play or is this something else at this point?
00:42:43.384 - 00:43:30.728, Speaker B: I think like parts of it could be a SaaS play. I mean like some things like the auctions like you're hosting that for a week, a month at most right? Like so you don't need to host that for a while. The staking of tokenomics could be more of a SaaS play and it's kind of the red hat Linux, right, where you, you know, there's, there's more of, hey, we'll just, we'll set it up for you and give one not, and you just pay it, pay a regular fee. So. But I think, like, that's, that's the tough thing about, like, crypto and the open source stuff. Everyone still reaches out, whether you have a SaaS model or not, people reach out for help and, you know, trying to be good and stewards of the community, you, you ultimately help them. Instead of just saying no, like, sorry, yeah, I'm busy.
00:43:30.728 - 00:43:35.644, Speaker B: You tend to at least, like, engage a little bit. So no matter what, it's taking away some of your bandwidth.
00:43:36.224 - 00:43:39.324, Speaker A: Do you think we need a better culture of tipping in web3?
00:43:40.064 - 00:43:48.832, Speaker B: Yes. I mean, gosh, I'm getting tips at left and right, right. When I just go to get a coffee nowadays, it's like, yo, you want a 20% tiff? I'm like, what?
00:43:48.968 - 00:43:49.288, Speaker A: Right?
00:43:49.336 - 00:44:05.664, Speaker B: Just poured it out. So, yeah, honestly, like, I've thought about putting tips. It would be very interesting to kind of see, like, whether projects tip or, you know, users who get in on an auction or something like that would tip.
00:44:07.164 - 00:44:19.984, Speaker A: I've always thought one of the hardest problems to solve in web3 is that everyone is a brutal, self interested capitalist, except it's also all open source code. And isn't it great? These people do it for free.
00:44:21.044 - 00:44:23.284, Speaker B: There's that long term and it's not free.
00:44:23.364 - 00:44:32.344, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's not free to do it. It's never free to do it. Sometimes it's free to use it, though. And that long term dichotomy is always one I find fascinating about this space.
00:44:33.684 - 00:44:48.628, Speaker B: So do I. It is. It's fascinating. It is frustrating. It is also definitely very difficult. Right. As someone who's sunk two or three years of their time into it, it's like building a sustainable model is not easy.
00:44:48.628 - 00:45:15.646, Speaker B: When you have that nature open source code, the fees are going to go towards zero at some point. So it's like, what is your moat? Where, you know, what other value are you adding outside of just the program that is on chain, that is driving value that other people can't replace? And so that's kind of where we focus a lot of our time.
00:45:15.710 - 00:45:23.914, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, Tommy, before I let you go today, let me know where people can learn more about Armada and where they can tip you.
00:45:25.804 - 00:45:44.540, Speaker B: Yes, you can learn more about Armada on Twitter at armadafi. And the website is armodify, so I don't have a tipping address yet. I'm not going to read off an address, but maybe I need to set up tomjohn 1028 Sol and just tell people to tip me there.
00:45:44.572 - 00:45:47.264, Speaker A: Or folks can just dm you a tip. Link one of the two.
00:45:47.724 - 00:45:49.514, Speaker B: Yes. Yes, exactly.
00:45:49.684 - 00:46:04.894, Speaker A: Well, thanks for coming on. Validated today. Validated is produced by Ray Belli with help from Ross Cohen, Brandon Ector, Emira Valiani and Ainsley Medford engineering by Tyler Morissette.
