00:00:03.840 - 00:00:59.938, Speaker A: Good morning, breakpoint. How are we doing? Welcome to day two of our conference, and my name is Aleftina Jakovenko. I'm head of community relations at Solana foundation, and I'm going to be your host for today until lunch break. So this morning, the theme of the day of the content is security, whether that's the safety and the reliability of the protocol itself or your personal awareness while exploring the crypto landscape. We have a speaker prepared for you today. We're going to have breaks and we're going to have a lunch break later on, during which I highly encourage you to explore the activations we have on the first floor. There isn't an NFT gallery which is going to be there for the whole duration of the conference.
00:00:59.938 - 00:01:35.094, Speaker A: But today there is a special setup is Neodym launch that you might want to check out if you want to dive a little bit more deeper into the security world. The first keynote speaker for today is going to be the CEO of Neodym, who's going to start with overview of how the security market market has looked back in 2020. What was his personal experience going through the past couple of years, and what the future of the security situation might look like. Please welcome to the stage Thomas Lumbertz.
