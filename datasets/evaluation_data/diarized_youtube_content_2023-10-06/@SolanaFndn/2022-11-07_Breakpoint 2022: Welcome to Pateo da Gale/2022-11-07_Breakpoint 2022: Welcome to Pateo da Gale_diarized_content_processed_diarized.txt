00:00:00.320 - 00:00:16.838, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. Breakpoint 2022. Let's hear it. So excited to be here. This is actually my second break point. Hopefully it's. Lisbon's treating you well so far.
00:00:16.838 - 00:00:48.214, Speaker A: The weather has been spectacular since Thursday. Looks to be good for the rest of the weekend. We've got an amazing, amazing schedule of events. Welcome to Pateo DeGale. This is the laboratory. This is where you're going to see some deep dives, some technical talks, and it's a really unique stage. This was actually the location for our closing party last year, so to see it now filled with devs bright and early on a Saturday morning is quite the experience for me.
00:00:48.214 - 00:01:15.854, Speaker A: But thank you for coming. Thank you for being here. I know there are three, three other options for you guys to explore this weekend, but you're in the right place. A little bit of housekeeping. I'll be your host for the morning session. We have refreshments scattered around the venue, so help yourself to coffee, breakfast, lunch when the time comes. Restroom is over here to my right, stage left, I guess that would be.
00:01:15.854 - 00:02:00.034, Speaker A: This is also the only location where. Where you can borrow sort of silent disco, noise canceling headsets. So if your head's down and you want to focus towards the front where you came in, grab a set of those headphones, put them on, get in the zone, return them on your way out. The only place where you can grab those. So we have quite the program for you guys today. If you do want to explore the other venues, we have shuttles running on a loop every 15 minutes to the other three venues. So, of course, you can spend the day with us, but if you'd like to get to any of the other great programming, head outside, find that shuttle.
00:02:00.034 - 00:02:53.136, Speaker A: I think that's it for housekeeping. If there's any questions, you can find me in between sessions over here. We've got a great program. Our first session today is with my colleague Jacob Creech, who is going to be talking about the developer tooling ecosystem that's come into play over the last year. How far we've come, and we've come a long way. We have come so far that some of my non technical, non dev colleagues have explored the tooling ecosystem to teach themselves hello world type programs. And one of my colleagues, Andrea, completed the hello World program, posted on Twitter that he had just completed his first Solana program, and within a short amount of time, two job offers flowed his way.
00:02:53.136 - 00:03:17.884, Speaker A: So I don't know if that could be said. With the tooling that we had in place for developers, a year ago. But it's pretty impressive that we've come this far, that those of us who don't code can jump right in and become Solana devs quickly and efficiently, efficiently enough to generate job offers. So, with that, I'm going to turn the stage over to Jacob. Please give Jacob Creech a warm welcome.
