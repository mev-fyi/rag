00:00:06.640 - 00:00:07.388, Speaker A: So tired.
00:00:10.494 - 00:00:11.046, Speaker B: Up to you.
00:00:11.070 - 00:00:12.154, Speaker C: Up to you. All right.
00:00:12.614 - 00:00:43.150, Speaker B: All right. So very appropriate. As we wind down the conference, we're going to talk about winding up your game. I'll just start off with Albert here. Just games have evolved and how we've monetized from box sales to subscribers, subscriptions to free to play. And that's opened up a lot of, like, early sales through Kickstarter and other things. Now that we have these wide open possibilities with cryptocurrency, can you kind of describe what, you know, nfts and initial game monetization? How is that changing?
00:00:43.262 - 00:01:22.364, Speaker A: Yeah, so traditionally you have to launch a game first and then you can monetize your in game content. With nfts, it's changed a lot. So without having to build a game first, you can build a community first and have nfts out there that you can sell. That's why we're seeing all these NFT drops. And on top of getting sales off of the NFT drops, you can make money off the transaction fees. I think that's the biggest breakthrough of NFTs because it's changing the model from the game developer making all the money to creators and other players. So we were able to do that for genopets, even just with our initial airdrop.
00:01:22.364 - 00:01:33.148, Speaker A: We dropped these eggs to our early adopters for free, and they're trading openly on FTX us and on Solanart, and that's generating transaction fees for us. So it's been pretty cool to see.
00:01:33.236 - 00:01:49.084, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you raise a really interesting point where you're already getting like real traction and you're starting to see, before you even launch your game, kind of what is resonating with players. Can you describe maybe like how valuable that is while you're developing the game before you even have to develop a lot of the game mechanics?
00:01:49.124 - 00:02:16.778, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, it's flipped the model completely on its head. Right. So a lot of times, I think also in traditional industries, too, you spend a lot of time building something that you think people will like and then you ship it. Maybe it's not 100% what people like, and then what you end up having to do is refine it. But then the way we have it going on with NFT games is that you build a community first and then you ship a very minimal game and then have the community help you build. Build it alongside.
00:02:16.946 - 00:02:40.200, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I'm getting into that. The weeds of this community here. So, like gamers, we're just going to gamify everything, you know? And maybe the more realistic way of saying that is we're going to try to break everything to our own game, maybe. Sharaf, can you just talk a little bit about how you think about that and how do you launch effectively, but while, you know, keeping things really, like, positive and set your game up for success?
00:02:40.352 - 00:03:36.688, Speaker D: Well, maybe to set some context, what we're doing with monkey ball launching on Solana this Christmas, it's a new esport game, essentially sits somewhere in the intersection between FIFA street and Final Fantasy. Maybe like role play with the soccer theme. So the essential parts of the game are, of course, the in game currency. And there are recipes of how to do a proper ido in a way that suits everybody, right? And everybody will try to game this, but I mean, we're kind of ahead of the curve with that right now. And then there's the NFT draw, because you do want players to be able to access the game right away and start playing. So how do you avoid the obvious pitfalls in that? Like someone having too many nfts or just trying to pay to win all the way. So it's baked in the game mechanics.
00:03:36.688 - 00:04:03.034, Speaker D: What we're doing with monkey ball is essentially a fair launch in the sense of the NFT drop. So it's the same price for everybody. You can only buy a set amount of nfts. And there are ways to counter bots, like setting up a lot of candy machines. That was Joe McCann's idea. And whitelisting. So there are ways to control that.
00:04:03.034 - 00:04:10.818, Speaker D: And then because it's the same price, we do not try to capture all the value. The value will be determined on secondary.
00:04:10.866 - 00:04:12.250, Speaker B: Marketplaces by the community.
00:04:12.362 - 00:04:15.294, Speaker D: By the community as they see fit.
00:04:15.794 - 00:04:41.120, Speaker B: Yeah, let's get to community. I think it's fascinating to see how the communities can both form naturally, both in terms of determining the value of everything. So I'm just going to open this up to the floor here. Just like how we're seeing Dow creation and refined guilds versus very fly by the sea, their pants guilds. What are we seeing? How communities around games are really leveraging these drops and coming together really early on in the development?
00:04:41.272 - 00:05:19.664, Speaker A: Well, I think a huge part of any gaming, even traditional gaming, is this whole concept of status. That's the metagame above everything, even social networks and gaming. And I think NFT just brings that to the forefront of it. So people want to get their first. If the narrative of the game really resonates with them, then you form a community around that, and then people want to be experts in it and they'll start creating content with it, they'll start going for the NFT drops first and they want to own all the NFTs that's related to the game. And that's what we've been seeing about how the community is building up, at least for us.
00:05:20.444 - 00:05:42.154, Speaker C: Simply put, I think NFTs allow more fun to be brought into gaming. Yes. It's about bringing the community in earlier and deeper into the entire experience from start to finish. So, you know, those are now maybe exploring gaming for the first time through nfTs. You know, they're able to experience something unlike any other. So I think it's all about, you know, bringing some more fun.
00:05:42.774 - 00:05:57.918, Speaker D: It also brings flex. Right? Like I own a very powerful character, maybe for the game. Like, I have very good stats. It's not just beautiful, I have very good stats in the game. I own this. I can put this, you know, on my profile. I can show my friends.
00:05:57.918 - 00:06:11.634, Speaker D: I mean, my kids will not pay a lot for brands, like wearing brands, but if they can flex with this sort of character, then they will pay for it. I mean, I will pay for it, but they would like this.
00:06:12.214 - 00:06:12.526, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:12.550 - 00:06:38.314, Speaker B: I remember my experience being just like on the early side of gaming. Typically it was just forums and discords, communities kind of speaking with developers. But, you know, having actual content of the game this early on in game development, I feel like the flexibility of NFTs where I can add on my own stuff on chain and just like, hey, developer, this thing I made, maybe you should probably use it in the game. Are we seeing any of that yet? Are we seeing how you can have the creator economy?
00:06:38.434 - 00:07:07.334, Speaker A: Yeah. So a huge part of it is that NFTs are basically metadata that's stored somewhere and we're seeing some people taking that metadata and interpreting it their own way and creating new content and new characters on it. And that's like the beauty of NFTs and also just blockchain gaming. It's the composability of it. And we're also talking to other projects where our characters or our nfts can appear in their game in some form or the other. So it creates this really open standard of gaming that's really exciting.
00:07:08.034 - 00:07:36.986, Speaker D: I think we are a bit early on for that, to be honest. I mean, for high production value games like we are putting on, the experience should need to be at least a bit curated. Right? So I don't see this happening right now, at least for us. But maybe after a while. I mean, I don't think YouTube could have succeeded that much with user generated content if that was the first thing happening in the world. Right. We had high production films and studios and then it happened.
00:07:36.986 - 00:07:41.434, Speaker D: So I think this is probably better order. But we are very early on.
00:07:41.554 - 00:08:02.374, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really interesting point. So. So how do we think about the evolution of this? So we kind of set the stage here. We have initial drop, the evolution of the community. How do you keep them engaged? Maybe you have opportunities for other drops and evolution of your content. Can you maybe speak about how are you thinking about these communities evolving and keeping them engaged?
00:08:04.074 - 00:08:04.546, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:08:04.610 - 00:08:37.298, Speaker C: I'm really excited for games towards the end of its life cycle, perhaps, and how NFTs have evolved from. From start to near finish. I think we're now seeing nfts at play in terms of before the game launch, in game characters. But as NFTs add more utility, more value, as the game comes to end of its life cycle, I think there's going to be a lot more creativity there to not only engage them back into the game, but even post game. Well, what else can they do with the NFT outside of the game? Two different areas, I think, that I'm really excited about.
00:08:37.376 - 00:09:08.894, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I like what Fortnite is actually doing, you know, with the additions and the seasons and all of that. So we're definitely bringing that into play. So, like, we're gonna have limited content. Like, when you breed two of our monkeys in the game, over time, there may be like a set period of time in which certain genes can pop up and create, you know, unique characters that will only be available at that season and cannot be created afterwards. And that brings a lot of rarity to the things and collectible ideas.
00:09:09.194 - 00:09:34.588, Speaker B: That makes sense. I mean, you're producing soccer game, so there's obviously a lot of corollary, the real world where you do seasons in there. So it's like, yeah, what do you think about, you know, the player's interaction with that? Like their life cycle? Do you expect there to be these, I don't know, maybe governance periods even, and they self form, kind of like, okay, this is the preseason stage. We do this kind of team formation versus this stage, or have you seen any of that kind of ideas yet?
00:09:34.676 - 00:10:01.098, Speaker D: I think this will happen. And I think actually guilds can push a lot of that because these are like unions of sorts, and then that kind of automatically can bring this into place. Or we're thinking about creating certain content that will cater certain guilds. Or like, if you have this boots, gaming boots on, then you're part of this guild but only if you're part of this guild. You can have these boots on and have a special bonus when like, accuracy bonus.
00:10:01.226 - 00:10:03.290, Speaker B: So do you deserve the boots?
00:10:03.442 - 00:10:04.814, Speaker D: You deserve the boots.
00:10:05.114 - 00:10:30.720, Speaker B: I can imagine like this offseason training thing going on too. Like this is the training season. This is in season, this is like, yeah, playoffs. And I think that's really interesting how that can evolve with blockchain histories. Can we, can we think like. Because right now it's not just this monetization factor, it's everything is public and being built off of. We have the distinction season not just through an API, but it's just sitting there queryable anytime by anybody.
00:10:30.720 - 00:10:36.256, Speaker B: Can you think about how we can leverage that? Or how have you been leveraging that, when you think about it?
00:10:36.280 - 00:10:58.404, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, one of the ways we're leveraging that is just having our nfts be mutable. So there are other nfts that can come in and mutate the state of your metadata and allow you to create other nfts with it. That, and also the capability postability aspect that I was talking about with other games building on top of it, which may be a ways away, but that's another way if that could happen.
00:11:00.704 - 00:11:33.378, Speaker B: Yeah, the mutability, and I think there's like that cryptokitty hats was kind of like the first things where somebody built on top of it. There's also just kind of all the stats and different combinations you can do. Have you thought about how the players being able to even self form different sub tournaments or sub activities and really taking, modulating even the core competitive aspects of the different games? Have you thought about that as you've formed your ideas?
00:11:33.506 - 00:11:34.698, Speaker A: Right, yeah, go ahead.
00:11:34.746 - 00:12:02.976, Speaker D: We thought about these sort of modes and allowing players to create their own interactions. And again, I think we're pretty early on, you want to do one thing very good, like the, you know, the storytelling of how the game is happening and the seasons and everything. Once that's done, and people actually love the game now, I think they'll be more comfortable with creating their own, you know, metagames within the game.
00:12:03.080 - 00:12:23.448, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. And I think we're creating the groundwork and the framework for how that could happen. But just like dao governance as they were talking about before, I think in the beginning the game developer will take a huge responsibility in that. And as the game matures, then you start opening it up for community governance and meta games being built that way.
00:12:23.536 - 00:12:52.130, Speaker D: Yeah, you should probably think of it like an App Store, right? Remember the first App Store in Apple, you didn't even have that. You just had Apple's apps and you saw how this whole thing works. You understood it. And then it's open for developers to create things. So, like, a game is not an open source technology project that people can just create anything out of. Like, if you give them a curated experience, they'll get it and they know what's missing, maybe even better than you, and try to innovate on top of that.
00:12:52.322 - 00:13:07.804, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about a little more, like, maybe what's missing? What are the kind of the risks here when you're. So we kind of went through the whole life cycle of launch into, like, how do you keep that engagement? What are the risks? Maybe even at day one, how can you set that? How can we avoid failure? And, like, what are the risks of failure?
00:13:08.864 - 00:13:22.080, Speaker A: So for me, I think just don't be too opinionated into anything and be nimble about how your community responds to it. Then be, you know, be open to change. I think that's the way I would approach it.
00:13:22.152 - 00:13:57.512, Speaker D: I would say to begin with, everything that is player versus player, team versus team. The major problem to begin with is liquidity, actually, even if you look at big games, the matching server, I mean, it can take you like a full two minutes to. To find other players. And this is, you know, PlayStation five with the entire community. It can take a while, right? So with this, it's. It's a risk. So if you don't take care of the inflation of game assets and allowing multiple players to find concurrently find each other on time, then you're at the risk of a very bad experience.
00:13:57.512 - 00:14:29.274, Speaker D: So, probably makes sense to begin with player versus environment, allow some breeding and then do PvP. But we try to think of things, you know, ten years from now in terms of the economy. The simulations that we run are at a ten year interval, and we're trying to think backwards about, hey, maybe there'll be a certain time, you know, where there are too many characters out there and the value just decreases. So how do we deflate the economy? Like, how do we retire players? Like, what's the next phase? That makes sense.
00:14:29.384 - 00:14:47.582, Speaker B: I mean, you're bringing up some really interesting points. Programs on a blockchain are immutable. How do you think about, in that world, being able to pivot, being able to adjust some of the, is it configuration parameters? Is it updates to programs? How have you been thinking about that as you evolve your games?
00:14:47.678 - 00:15:12.846, Speaker A: Well, to start, most of the gaming logic is on centralized servers to start and will gradually move on to blockchain logic. I think that's a good way. I'm not a proponent of having all gaming logic on chain to start with. First, because of performance reasons, and obviously second, for most games and even most products, you don't know where you're going to end up. That's my thought.
00:15:12.990 - 00:15:47.154, Speaker D: I totally agree. And I think blockchain should add value and not just create limitations. If the whole concept is just setting us, locking us in a space where we cannot innovate anymore, then we've obviously done the wrong thing. And this is why we have the Daos, right? I think any game should have a Dao, and then the code should be flexible enough that you can change the contracts with the agreement of the dao of, hey, this is how we want to play the game. And if it suits everybody, because it makes sense, by all means.
00:15:47.734 - 00:16:15.132, Speaker B: So let's take a look into the future. That dao comment really got me thinking. You know, about five years from now, after, you know, games launch and things, there's going to be existing Daos out there, existing guilds that have, you know, some NFTs in their market. How does the NFT launch change? Like, what is it? If I'm in development right now, I know I'm going to release in three years, how should I be thinking about my launch? Given that world where there's going to be existing guilds out there with existing content? How do I merge my content with that content?
00:16:15.268 - 00:16:49.844, Speaker A: Well, a thing that we've been doing, first of all, it's still really early on, so it's hard to say how that's going to play out in three years. But today, what we're doing with guilds is that we are inviting them into our game and we're doing co branded in game assets with them that they can use with their scholars. And I'd imagine in three years, where the space is way more saturated, you would have to do way more curated experiences, and then the guilds will get to pick. And unless you make your offer very compelling, then you might not be able to compete in this market.
00:16:50.224 - 00:17:02.000, Speaker D: Well, first, I agree that it's impossible to predict what we'll do in five years because, you know, five years ago we didn't even have Defi, I think, let alone NFT games and the Metaverse. Right?
00:17:02.072 - 00:17:03.144, Speaker B: You barely had free to play.
00:17:03.224 - 00:17:26.604, Speaker D: Yeah. So. So it's, it's, it's quite impossible. So what you. So how do you prepare for the unknown? Right. Well, first of all, you need to avoid making big mistakes like locking some vectors or locking some things that cannot be changed forever, that will set you on the wrong course over five years. You should probably avoid all of that.
00:17:26.604 - 00:17:43.106, Speaker D: With that in mind, you should probably run all sorts of simulations of different scenarios and how things can change and merge and be composable enough to adjust survival of the fetus. That's what it is you need to adjust over time. Yeah.
00:17:43.130 - 00:17:57.474, Speaker B: Something I thought about here was the technology built on this. Can you talk a little bit about. Yeah. What technology gaps are out there right now and kind of what is going to enable developers to release with confidence more from a technology perspective, do you think?
00:17:57.594 - 00:18:10.904, Speaker C: I think given that all things web3 are still very early, there's a lot more that I think the community needs to do to help each other understand, educate each other so that we all, as one, can grow stronger and fill in gaps as needed.
00:18:10.944 - 00:18:11.096, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:11.120 - 00:18:30.724, Speaker C: I mean, I don't think one company or one blockchain can do it all. I think it requires really the power of everyone. But as that moves forward, I think it's also our duty to help the gaming community understand how web3 can be leveraged in a positive way, in an efficient way. But I'm hoping that that happens sooner than later.
00:18:31.744 - 00:18:57.604, Speaker B: One thing we've seen from web two, kind of like on a technology perspective, is all these drop mechanics, just with traditional drops on Twitch or through content creators. And we've started to see that in the Defi world. A lot of it's done in the Gamefi world, but it hasn't really reached mainstream content creation yet. How do you think that evolves? Because it seems to be some pretty obvious synergies there as it becomes more.
00:18:57.644 - 00:19:17.746, Speaker A: Normalized, I think it's starting to slowly happen already. I mean, the mainstream audience is always going to be a little slower to the innovations of crypto. From what I've seen, we're getting a lot of calls from traditional brands and events that want to do co branded launches and stuff. So I think moving forward, that's just going to get bigger and bigger.
00:19:17.930 - 00:19:47.470, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. And there's a lot of hype around the games, right. And all the gaming studios, the major gaming studios, are all fairly interested in what's going on and experimenting. And I think one issue that we see is that all the listed companies, the big ones, can't really handle crypto. I mean, if they're listed in the US, can't really handle this part easily. I mean, the legal team will be like, we do not touch crypto. Right? So they invest in things and they call and they ask.
00:19:47.470 - 00:20:14.764, Speaker D: So I definitely see this. This evolve, I think, you know, we used to think like, one of our investors is Morgan Beller. She was the co founder of, co creator of Libra in Facebook. And she said, we used to think that stable coins will be the thing that brings the next 100 million people to crypto. And we now think it's games, actually. And I do see this happen with all the usual burden of keys.
00:20:16.504 - 00:20:16.816, Speaker A: And.
00:20:16.840 - 00:20:30.714, Speaker D: The barriers of entry that are super high right now. But this will evolve. I mean, we already see NPC wallets and ways that are just easier. So I do see this as the way that 100 million new people come into crypto.
00:20:31.534 - 00:20:41.118, Speaker B: Games always been kind of tech forward. You know, GPU's don't exist because of AI machine learning models or, you know, crypto. It's games.
00:20:41.166 - 00:21:16.186, Speaker A: Yeah, I wanted to add to that, actually, to the user adoption thing. Since gaming has come along, a lot of my traditional finance friends who refused to touch crypto beforehand are now all into nfts and stuff. They're in discords using like, cool usernames that I'm like. Usually they're in a suit with their full names, you know, super, super formal. And I feel like, especially for as a millennial, this is who we are inside. You know, when we were in our teens, we're playing like, World of Warcraft or we're playing, you know, any games. We had an identity online that was separate from our real life identity.
00:21:16.186 - 00:21:36.854, Speaker A: And then when we got into the workforce, you know, we got the traditional world got us to where we are today. And all of a sudden gaming and NFTs told us, hey, you can be who you always were on the inside. And I'm seeing this with all my friends who are in traditional finance that's embracing this is who they always been this whole time. So 100% to add to that, games.
00:21:36.974 - 00:21:56.598, Speaker C: Thanks to NFTs, are truly bringing the masses, I think of it as a trojan horse, into crypto. They don't quite realize it, but, I mean, we all know they're coming into crypto that way, right? So I think it's. It's a very novel way for us as a community to bring fun, bring fun into the masses, but also bring them into our crypto world.
00:21:56.766 - 00:22:20.250, Speaker D: I've been in this sort of events for like five years now. So hundreds of events. And what you see over time is that with NFTs, the audience changed a bit. I think NFTs brought more sort of culture pop art into the space. You see kind of different people letting in right now. More girls. Yeah.
00:22:20.282 - 00:22:21.130, Speaker A: Not just nerds like us.
00:22:21.162 - 00:22:27.538, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it's a beautiful thing. I mean, it brought in other types of cultures into crypto.
00:22:27.626 - 00:22:40.134, Speaker B: Right. And that's got to be affecting the way that you're doing your initial drops, too, because you're, well, I had this segment of, you know, crypto speculators. Now I just want people who want bling, you know? Is that really affecting the way you're marketing and choosing your distribution?
00:22:40.534 - 00:22:57.794, Speaker A: I think for me, it just makes it so that you're talking in more of a mainstream marketing way, which is more comfortable for marketing. Anyway, prior to this, you have to talk to very specific audience with a very specific crypto knowledge. And it's actually more comforting for me to be able to market to mainstream audience.
00:23:01.134 - 00:23:36.714, Speaker D: I actually understand why we want to have a new people joining the space through these drops. But to be honest, as a marketeer, it makes less sense for me right now to do Facebook advertising instead of focusing on communities that I know that are my audience right now. And then let maybe Facebook meta bring in the masses because market education is a super expensive endeavor. Right. The sort of companies that sponsor the Olympics are in charge of doing that. We're in charge of providing.
00:23:37.414 - 00:24:09.144, Speaker B: That's a great point. That's actually something I've been talking to a lot of people about at the conference this week, is that when you bring in value that you own, you're basically buying a bunch of people buying in as influencers. They're incentivized, not just for more fun people to play the game with. They're more people to, you know, bring in an economy that you're facilitating through blockchain. Have you thought about like that when you're, these discord conversations probably have a little bit different than they were, you know, five years ago as you're starting your games.
00:24:10.004 - 00:24:58.614, Speaker D: I mean, I try to think of us, and, you know, without being presumptuous, as sort of a government of a new nation that tries to set an economy that everybody enjoys. So I don't think of what we do as revenue generation. I'm just trying to create an economy that everybody loves, enjoys, and that can flourish. And if it flourish, then I have my cut of it and that's my incentive. And I'm super happy about this, but not as an limited company with a sum zero game, right? Whatever you paid, I collected. It's not that, it's I'm setting an economy, I'm setting all the rules. Everything should be tipped up and then people love it and then I get my cuts because I'm part of this economy.
00:24:59.154 - 00:25:19.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree 100%. And we're seeing that on our discord as well. And people are taking charge. We have. We have a community there called DNA because we're genetic genome pets. So our vip community is called DNA in there. And everybody in there actually act like they own the game, which they do.
00:25:19.194 - 00:25:29.598, Speaker A: Our game will eventually be owned by the community and they're making suggestions, making rules and moderating the whole discord channel for us.
00:25:29.646 - 00:25:59.042, Speaker B: Actually, I'm going to move slightly a couple years in the future, maybe. I think that being the openness of blockchain, you can see who participated in previous drops. So people are. Next games are going to be doing drops on your people who have bought into your drops. Have you thought about that at all? And is that good? Is like, what part of that are positive and negative and, you know, is it building the ecosystem? And how do I do that appropriately? If I'm a game that's just trying to enhance the ecosystem, how do I do that gracefully?
00:25:59.218 - 00:26:06.818, Speaker A: So do you mean the open blockchain being like the same game doing drops over and over again or more like.
00:26:06.866 - 00:26:27.640, Speaker B: You know, everybody who pays the static amount for monkey ball, I'm producing another game. I think there's a lot of overlap in our player bases. I kind of want to market my stuff and I can drop to the same players that have dropped on monkey ball. Maybe I'm making a, I don't know, volleyball game or something. Yeah. Can we think about how that can be done?
00:26:27.712 - 00:26:32.296, Speaker D: You mean the sort of sushi attacks uniswap?
00:26:32.360 - 00:26:33.400, Speaker B: Exactly. Sort of.
00:26:33.472 - 00:27:03.314, Speaker D: Sort of, yes. To be honest, I am weary of that. But if it happens, it means we're doing well, right? I mean, I don't see people dropping on small games. That doesn't make sense. So kind of be happy and flattered if that happens to us. It does not mean that I love it, but we'll see. And if it can make sense somehow, I mean, if we're not eroding value from our community, then by all means.
00:27:03.314 - 00:27:22.966, Speaker D: Yeah. And, you know, people. And that's the whole idea. If you created this economy and I'm disincentivized to leave the game and go to another game, that just dropped me something, I'm disincentivized to do that because I'm happy with this community. Great. It's kind of like immigration, right? If I'm happy where I am, I'm.
00:27:22.990 - 00:27:40.506, Speaker A: Not moving yeah, I think these vampire attacks are a little more difficult in gaming than it is in Defi, just simply because. Because you can't fork the code and fork everything and just, you know, and then airdrop. But I mean, the danger does exist, but I feel like that's what makes it exciting and challenging.
00:27:40.610 - 00:27:46.482, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's nothing. I mean, we're going back to the community. I mean, you can't fork the community and everything that goes along with that and.
00:27:46.498 - 00:27:50.170, Speaker A: Yeah, and uniswap still exists. Fine with sushiswap. So.
00:27:50.362 - 00:28:20.188, Speaker B: Yeah, another thing I was thinking about that was if you use some of, you know, monkey balls or genome pets in the next game, you use some of your open standards or whatever is kind of created on top of that, that just has more use cases for your content and that can only increase the ecosystem and the robustness of the ecosystem. So I view that as a positive thing for the community. The ecosystem around gaming.
00:28:20.276 - 00:28:33.948, Speaker A: Yeah. And I feel like it's too early in this process to think of things as a zero sum game. I think any traction we can build together and the pie is still very small and it could grow super big from here. So I'm not too worried about that.
00:28:34.076 - 00:28:35.948, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm not too worried about that.
00:28:36.116 - 00:28:50.346, Speaker B: Yeah. So we're kind of getting close to the end of time, I guess, when I would leave with like, what are you most excited about? Like, you've done some drops. You've kind of like seeing how this is going. What are you looking for? Like, what is kind of like the utopia as you.
00:28:50.530 - 00:28:57.774, Speaker A: So our thesis is that we can build a game alongside our community. I'm excited to see how that works out.
00:28:59.474 - 00:29:31.984, Speaker D: I'm actually super excited about the upcoming milestones, like our ideo, our NFT drop. And then we're super excited about the sort of content that we created because I've just seen the NFTs yesterday and they are beautiful. They are beautiful. But they're not just beautiful with a collectible value. They are game players. They have stats and some are rare and are super fast. And I'm thinking about creating content with actual teams and it's endless opportunities and players can be super portable and just enjoy this.
00:29:31.984 - 00:29:41.224, Speaker D: As I said, we're playing the government in some aspects, we're playing God because we're interfering with genome and creating these sort of things. It's magnificent.
00:29:41.624 - 00:29:42.928, Speaker A: I'm excited for monkey ball.
00:29:43.016 - 00:29:43.376, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:29:43.400 - 00:29:44.004, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:44.344 - 00:30:16.554, Speaker C: I'm excited for what we are not even thinking at this moment. Meaning as a gamer, as a community member, I mean, having genopets and monkey ball as part of our partners at Metaflex Studios, why not some kind of collaboration where as a gamer, I could hop into both metaverses, possibly both. And even our vip partners like Neand Heroes ambiance Studios would love to see just a lot of fun collaborations to come. And of course, once the big gaming series come in, Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, I think it's gonna open up a lot more creativity.
00:30:16.594 - 00:30:18.594, Speaker B: You have a egg as a soccer ball.
00:30:18.754 - 00:30:19.186, Speaker D: Sorry?
00:30:19.250 - 00:30:20.258, Speaker B: An egg as a soccer ball.
00:30:20.346 - 00:30:26.374, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Actually thought about that. Let's talk.
00:30:28.274 - 00:30:31.538, Speaker B: Good, good thought to end on. Thank you so much for your time.
00:30:31.626 - 00:30:32.414, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:30:36.354 - 00:30:37.554, Speaker A: All right, thanks.
00:30:37.634 - 00:30:37.914, Speaker D: That's great.
