00:00:01.280 - 00:00:51.920, Speaker A: I'm Nousha from Aur. I'm a developer with a background in neuroscience, and I'm also founder of ore. And today I'm going to tell you more about what I think the future of social media should become. So if you look at social media today, it has a bunch of negative effects on our mental health. First of all, studies found that there is a positive correlation between anxiety, depression, and social media usage. Children are less and less creative, are not able to come up with unique ideas in schools or be humorous. And lastly, I guess all of us feel it.
00:00:51.920 - 00:02:14.756, Speaker A: Our attention spans are decreasing because of constant stimulation. So even if there are all these negative effects, social media is something that is part of our daily lives, and it's here to stay. So I'm wondering, how would our world look like if we could use social media to improve ourselves as humans? So how I would envision the new generation of social media is to have the technology work for us instead of against us. Meaning that it would inherently be built not to play on our weaknesses, but rather to empower us and enhance our human capabilities. And of course, by leveraging blockchain technology, there will also be digital ownership of our assets. So we're actually building some kind of social media platform that is, that we believe is part of this new generation of social media. It's called, or is a decentralized social media platform that is using sound as its primary medium.
00:02:14.756 - 00:02:57.684, Speaker A: So think a bit like Instagram, but then decentralized, and then not with videos or photos, but with sounds and audio visuals. And we're using sound because sound is actually super powerful. And so first of all, we believe that this platform can improve attention span, because to listen, you actually need to activate your focused attention. None of us can passively listen. When you listen, you need your focused attention. On the same time, sound has this ability to make us feel something. Without that, we can resist.
00:02:57.684 - 00:03:39.774, Speaker A: And living in a society where it's not so accepted or allowed to feel, it's just not healthy for us. I think it's really important that we allow ourselves to feel more. And this is amazing about sound, it just does that. And last but not least, it's also activating our imagination. So think about listening to a voice. Like your imagination immediately forms a Persona around this voice. And that's also a bit of the difference between books or movies where your imagination is being activated.
00:03:39.774 - 00:04:14.824, Speaker A: So by using sound, we will also automatically combat the overstimulation caused by visual input. The tech that we are using, we are using compressed nfts and we are adding location, timestamp, an abstract visual art piece, and a description, fully open source. And I would like to do a demo. If you want. You can also try it out. Like this is. We actually launched two days ago, so yeah, you're really welcome to try it out as well.
00:04:14.824 - 00:05:02.124, Speaker A: I have a bad history with demos, but I hope that the demo gods will be with us today. So maybe before we can check out the map. So this app got live two days ago, and some people already minted some of their ores. So here you can see a map. And those are basically all our Audi Nfts, or ores, how we call them. And I just want to just listen to some of them together to get an idea of what it means to actually listen instead of see. Let's see.
00:05:02.124 - 00:05:23.404, Speaker A: Okay, this was at dinner yesterday. Is it connected? Actually, you cannot hear this right now, right? Yeah. Okay. Amazing. Okay, let's see if we can. Another one. This was at the.
00:05:23.404 - 00:05:44.022, Speaker A: I mean, listen, I'm not sure. Okay, let's do it.
00:05:44.108 - 00:05:53.574, Speaker B: Bro, this party fucking sucks, man. It's like the same techno as everywhere else. Guys, wake up. Find Jesus. Find Jesus, guys.
00:05:55.954 - 00:06:23.054, Speaker A: Okay, so, yeah, we can try out the flow together. If you feel like making a nice sound, we can actually record an audio of. Yeah. Nft together. So I don't know if you have something to release from this whole week. Now it's the time. All right, thank you.
00:06:23.054 - 00:06:53.874, Speaker A: We can re listen to it. I mean, let's try. All right. How would you describe this moment? Happy. I will add my location. Okay, so this nFt. Oh, I still need to mint.
00:06:53.874 - 00:07:17.494, Speaker A: This is, by the way, like a very rare breakpoint edition. NFT after today, it's not going to be available anymore. And actually, this whole application is going to be down. Only the map will be available. So today is basically the last day that you can use it. Now I have to find it somewhere here. Epic.
00:07:17.494 - 00:08:02.482, Speaker A: Oh. Oh, yeah, that's it. And it's also in my wallet now. And, okay, I tested quite a lot, so it's over here. But having the metadata and you can also listen it through your wallet or send to a friend. I mean, this is only the beginning. We want to continue with a lot of cool features.
00:08:02.482 - 00:08:25.522, Speaker A: Also build the social media around it with profiles. Oh, yeah. So. So, yeah. My team, we have Mimi, the community manager. Like our Twitter in the middle. You can follow us on Twitter on the sides.
00:08:25.522 - 00:08:34.944, Speaker A: And if you have any questions, feedback, feel free to come to me and to talk to one of us. Yeah. Thank you so much for listening.
