00:00:00.280 - 00:00:25.988, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's Changelog, where we go through the changes in Solana week by week. My name is Jacob. I'm joined this week with Jonas. And let's get started. So this past week we have developer tickets for breakpoint. So if you are interested in going to breakpoint this year, which is in Amsterdam, and you're a developer, you can apply for a developer ticket and get them at a pretty good discount compared to other tickets. I believe.
00:00:25.988 - 00:00:32.328, Speaker A: Currently they are $200 per developer ticket. So go apply for it. If you're a developer and you want.
00:00:32.336 - 00:00:38.784, Speaker B: To go to breakpoint, oh, that's definitely a good value. How is decided who is a developer and who's not, right?
00:00:38.824 - 00:01:07.174, Speaker A: So if you have open source contributions, basically at all, if you are a developer with a GitHub, with open source contributions, you can get a developer ticket. If you have any Solana contributions, you will automatically also get a developer ticket. So basically, if you're a developer, whether or not you develop on Solana, on even web3, you can get a ticket to breakpoint at a pretty steep discount.
00:01:07.554 - 00:01:09.374, Speaker B: Hey, amazing. Can't wait.
00:01:09.674 - 00:01:36.078, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited. Moving on to other news. So this week, Metaplex announced that they will be making their program immutable over the course of 18 ish months. They have a plan that you can read through on Twitter, has a bunch of information on, like, what the implications are and some more information of, like, what changes that they are making on the program.
00:01:36.246 - 00:01:38.630, Speaker B: And they also introduced some fees, right?
00:01:38.782 - 00:01:58.152, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a few different fees. Definitely. Go check it out. You can join the discussion on Twitter as well as their mpl on, on GitHub on what your thoughts are on these changes. It's good that they're changing to be immutable in the long term. So we're definitely happy about that.
00:01:58.288 - 00:01:59.604, Speaker B: Yes, for sure.
00:01:59.984 - 00:03:05.372, Speaker A: In other news, for the proposal this week, we are here to talk about interfaces. So there's been a lot of different discussion about interfaces on Twitter. We did a Twitter space, I think, two weeks ago about interfaces and even more to talk about, like, what they are, what they empower other people to do on Solana and what kind of implementations that people are kind of trying to figure out. So there is a new SRC, it's SRC 15 by Toli on interfaces, and he kind of describes what the goals are for interfaces and some ideas of how to implement them. There are also, I believe it's SRc ten and twelve and also three. Those are all different ones by John Sink at labs as well as noaaabs for different implementations on interfaces, a lot of new different ways. Definitely join the discussion on the forum to learn more about interfaces and which implementation you think suits you best.
00:03:05.558 - 00:03:24.328, Speaker B: Yeah, I would also encourage everyone to join these discussions because I think last time when we talked about it, it was still based on cross program invocations. And the new proposal here looks way better, but it's probably also more complicated to implement, so I think we will need lots of help from everybody.
00:03:24.496 - 00:04:23.744, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think the one that I told he is describing interfaces being discoverable from the program binary or. Yes, and then you shouldn't be have to do any CPI, which is a lot different from the other implementations. It's also different that the transactions must be the same size. So these are all great for a developer experience at lens, but it's also very hard to implement interfaces with all these constraints if you wanted a short kind of like explanation of what interfaces are. So let's say that you have a token and the token has a transfer function, and that transfer function has an amount parameter in a destination. That's just an example. Today on Solana, if you had a token and say the token program with that transfer instruction, with those parameters, you could only transfer tokens or create tokens with that singular token program.
00:04:23.744 - 00:05:48.242, Speaker A: What you could do instead is, is interfaces, is that you define what that function is that everybody will implement, so that transfer that amount to who, and then every token programs that exist can implement that transfer function and adhere to whatever the interfaces. For token programs in general, this kind of allows a little bit more innovation and competitive landscape within the Solana community, and also will allow less. If there's ever an issue with any of these token programs, there's a lot less of a blast radius on like a vulnerability or issue. So you'll have multiple token programs, you could have a very defined set of functions and parameters that everybody can implement. And then given whatever the implementation is of the interfaces, all you would have to do is expect these different functions and these different parameters to be able to interact with any type of token. On Solana, Ethereum does this with ERC 20, and they also have different interfaces for the different ercs, like I think it was 713 1155, et cetera. This would be enabling these things on Solana.
00:05:48.418 - 00:06:02.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I can't wait for me as a developer to just put in a program id and then I call another program because you can use it at some point for all kinds of programs, not only tokens. So I think this would be a great change.
00:06:02.274 - 00:06:22.644, Speaker A: Yeah, you can do it more than just tokens. For example, I do this on Ethereum for nfts, so you'd be able to do more than one NFT program for interfaces for sign in tokens, all sorts of things. So it opens up a lot more innovation in the space on Solana.
00:06:22.804 - 00:06:50.388, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds great. Let's have a look what else happened in the Solana space this week. So I found this commit here. It's a new keygen, which generates zero knowledge keys now. So it's like the el gamal curve. So they are a little bit different than the normal wallet key pair that you would have, which is the at 25,519 curve. So this will probably.
00:06:50.388 - 00:07:07.264, Speaker B: So there's some more zero knowledge stuff coming to Solana for sure. I also heard that the unity SDK is also looking into zero knowledge stuff using the Lite protocol, which is now also on Solana. So, yeah, there's lots of zero knowledge stuff coming, I think. What's your feeling on that?
00:07:07.604 - 00:08:11.910, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really exciting to see this kind of stuff. It enables privacy on the base layer, and it's not a requirement on the l one or the protocol to implement it, but other people, because of the way that people can build on Solana, other people can implement them and add privacy to Solana. So you have a lot of these issues in like, other chains, like Ethereum, where you can't do this really. And so you have additional layers on top of Ethereum that enable this, versus on Solana, you can do this by building the application on top of on Solana instead of a different layer, enabling composability with these privacy enabled protocols in every single application on Solana, instead of having to basically bridge between the different layers. So it's cool to have on Solana. I'm looking forward to all the different innovation that happens.
00:08:12.102 - 00:08:54.086, Speaker B: Yeah, me too. It's not only for private transactions, but for example, you can now build something like a battleship game or something like this or poker or something. So I'm very excited about that. Of course, the next thing is a little change, that it's a little, very little breaking change, maybe for some people. So the get transaction RPC call is now not returning the address lookup tables anymore if it is set to null, which is the intended behavior. But in case someone was relying on this, which Steven Lucia says, no one used it anywhere but just wanted to mention it.
00:08:54.230 - 00:09:02.850, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So that's specifically address lookup tables within the JSON parsing on get transaction, correct?
00:09:02.962 - 00:09:04.266, Speaker B: Yes. Okay.
00:09:04.330 - 00:09:31.662, Speaker A: So just definitely check that out if you're doing that. And with web3 js. Another news, there is a new compiler version of Solang, so they have 0.30 Venice. So soling is a way that you can write solidity on Solana. It's a, basically it compiles solidity to my understanding is it compiles rust or. And it can also do this with anchor because I saw that it was also implemented in anchor the other day.
00:09:31.662 - 00:10:02.544, Speaker A: So what you can do is you can write Sony smart contracts for Solana. Solang over the past few months has been really starting to mature. So definitely check it out. Try building a solidity contract using Solang on Solana and let us know how it goes. We will be personally on the dev rel side at Solana foundation building out docs and examples coming soon so that you can chew less glass as you write solidity for the first time.
00:10:03.284 - 00:10:29.964, Speaker B: Yeah, they say they have extensive documentation and I looked at it a little bit. So they have a nice example here, something with zombies. So yeah, definitely check it out. I haven't checked it out yet because I don't really know how to write solidity, but I will probably learn it to be able to, to teach and make a video about it. But this is really cool for like Ethereum developers who use solidity to get an easy start on Solana.
00:10:30.544 - 00:10:34.564, Speaker A: Makes sense. And then what resources of the week have you seen?
00:10:35.144 - 00:11:08.184, Speaker B: There are a few. Like, for example, form functions is now finally going completely open source. So form functions for the people who don't know it's an NFT marketplace. And now they are going completely open source. And they even wrote like a bunch of documentation for anyone who wants to work with the code. You can now just take it, build your own marketplace. They have here some documentation on how participation NFTs work, how campaigns work, designing form functions, your eggs, and how to build your own NFT marketplace.
00:11:08.184 - 00:11:10.216, Speaker B: So it's a really nice resource. Yeah.
00:11:10.240 - 00:11:31.740, Speaker A: If anybody is interested in how they built form function, all these resources that they wrote up really helps you understand from both how do I manage infrastructure for my applications on Solana as well as the different barriers that they've ran into and how they solve them. So it's really great that they wrote all this up.
00:11:31.892 - 00:11:38.304, Speaker B: And then let's talk about AI. So there's a chat GPT plugin on Solana now, right?
00:11:38.804 - 00:12:13.332, Speaker A: Yes. So I've seen this. This is a chat JBT plugin that was built by Noah from Solana Labs. And what it kind of allows you to do is interact with chat GBT and look up things and understand what things on the Solana blockchain. So you can say, what is this NFT at this address? And it will give you the picture of the NFT. It'll give you some information about the NFT and more. There's also things that you can do and I think that are being built is that like you can possibly even interact and send transactions with this plugin.
00:12:13.332 - 00:12:27.504, Speaker A: So it's really cool that this exists. And if you build on top of it, you can enable other integrations with chat GPT or OpenAI to interact with the Solana blockchain. So super cool that NOAA's been doing this.
00:12:28.124 - 00:12:34.224, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so too. Okay, let's talk about a little bit about the successful release of 14.
00:12:34.684 - 00:12:58.546, Speaker A: Yes. So 1.14 it reached. They had a call on Monday for 100% on 114.17. And what's great and what makes a good release is it was a non event. No one noticed that the release is going on. It got pushed out and now the cluster is running on one dot one four dot one seven.
00:12:58.546 - 00:13:20.676, Speaker A: If you're interested on information of like what features went into one dot one four dot one seven, you can go look at that. There's a blog post on solana.com dot tells you all the different features. But this is really exciting because it kind of tells you that a lot of the testing that went into it, it made it a smooth release and that's what you want to see.
00:13:20.860 - 00:13:23.268, Speaker B: Yeah. Sometimes new news are the best news, right?
00:13:23.356 - 00:13:31.348, Speaker A: No news is the best news. And now we can celebrate for all the features that are coming out with this new version. So super excited that this has happened.
00:13:31.476 - 00:14:16.028, Speaker B: That is really nice. On a small note for the anchor developers out there, you might be running into a few problems because metadata v two was removed from the metadata program. So I recommend you check out the release nodes and maybe directly point to the master version because this already fixed in the master. And you can do this for example by here in your cargo terminal to directly point to the master version. There are some problems you may run into. Maybe you need to add like fix your winner version or maybe you need to hard code token metadata version. But all of this should be fixed soon.
00:14:16.028 - 00:14:24.424, Speaker B: Labs actually skipped the version 15 and we will directly go to 16 and it should be tagged, I think today, right?
00:14:25.044 - 00:14:46.012, Speaker A: Yes, hopefully today once 16 is tagged, all these issues that Jonas is talking about will go away. They'll tag 1.16 and then that will come up with some fixes that will create a new tagged version for you, likely 0.28 for anchor fixing all these issues and you don't have to worry about them anymore.
00:14:46.148 - 00:15:01.304, Speaker B: Yeah, super nice. Also, all the problems I mentioned right before, you can also find solutions on Solana Stack Exchange. I think all of them have been asked there. So just go there, search for your problem and then you should be helped probably.
00:15:01.464 - 00:15:30.778, Speaker A: Yep. If you're ever also, if you're ever interested in asking a question or run into any issue building on sauna, definitely ask on Sauna Stack Exchange. That helps anybody looking at these issues in the future find the solution as well as allows a group or a community to help solve it together. So thank you for joining us on this week's Changelog. We will be back next week to talk about more changes in Salana. Adios.
00:15:30.946 - 00:15:32.690, Speaker B: See you next week everybody. Bye.
