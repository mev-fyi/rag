00:00:03.360 - 00:00:31.450, Speaker A: Good morning. How's everyone doing? Woo. We are here again for the unfortunately last day of breakpoint 2022. It's been a pretty amazing three days. It's been really great to see everyone coming out and sort of participating in this crazy event that we have the privilege of doing every year. So walk you through a little bit of day three again. Thank you all for coming out.
00:00:31.450 - 00:01:05.594, Speaker A: I know it's early in the morning. A reminder of our venue map. Let's go through some of the cool stuff that's happening today that I'm particularly excited about. So, first off, there's going to be some conversations on the technical stage around the migration of helium from their existing l one to being a network built on top of Solana. So there's a technical dive by one of the engineers who've been working on that transition. I think that'll be a pretty interesting session. Oh boy, an anchor workshop, a bad pun I have been promoting for days that I hope you all go to and enjoy.
00:01:05.594 - 00:01:54.622, Speaker A: And some also workshops on how you can develop with SPL governance and the integration with realms. Here on our main stage, we have a few cool things going on today. You'll hear a bunch from Ledger, you'll hear from Stripe on some of their on ramping technologies, and some of the folks who are starting to integrate and use that. The migration of sort of the larger ecosystem from being primarily EVM based in the web3 space with a few other things like Solana to the SVM actually being extended on Cosmos on a few other areas, and the SVM becoming a runtime that's not necessarily just unique to Solana, the same way that EVM is not just unique to Ethereum. And you'll get an update from Render. Render had a pretty awesome demo and announcement last year. They've been doing a lot of stuff since then.
00:01:54.622 - 00:02:24.610, Speaker A: We're going to talk about some of those changes as well. Closing out the day the forum big ideas stage. There's a live recording of the podcast acquired one of my favorite shows. They're actually doing a two and a half hour recording from, I think it's noon to 230 today on the history of Qualcomm. So if you're not familiar with acquire, they are one of the best company and technology company history podcasts out there. So they're doing a live show. It's free for everyone who has a breakpoint pass.
00:02:24.610 - 00:02:49.524, Speaker A: If your friends don't have a breakpoint pass, I think it's like $10 to get in at the door. It's pretty cool. It's worth checking out. We'll be talking about how web3 can be used in protecting human rights and for other things than just financial institutions and governance. So I think that's going to be a pretty interesting talk as well. And we'll, of course, close out the conference there with some closing thoughts from Raj Nanitoli. And of course, our community stage continues.
00:02:49.524 - 00:03:25.580, Speaker A: You can go to solana.com voice and then show up for some of the open mics there that are sort of more of a community centric stage where you can pitch ideas and have conversations. There's some devastations there to get some work done. This is at the hacker House venue. If you're at the hacker house before, they'll be talking about go to market strategies and gaming as well for web3 and, and a conversation on MeV and some of the ideas around that and what that can be useful for areas MeV can be harmful. MeV is one of my favorite topics because it is not positive or negative. It's all about how it's used, and some people use it positively and some people don't.
00:03:25.580 - 00:03:50.296, Speaker A: So it's a really nice topic to dive into. We will also be closing out tonight with a closing celebration at a place I can't pronounce, but it's on the slide and it's also on the agenda. I have a pronouncer even on my notes. And man, I'm not even going to try check Twitter and telegram. We're going to be pinning the address and exactly how to get there in it. There'll be a few shuttles running as well. This will start at 09:00 p.m.
00:03:50.296 - 00:04:09.484, Speaker A: So our program will end at the forum at about 07:00 p.m. There's 2 hours to go get some dinner, to go hang out, to go change, do whatever you need to do. And then the closing celebration will start at nine and we'll roll straight through for that. So that's a little bit about what's coming on day three of breakpoint. I'm going to hand it off to Amira and we can get the show started. Thanks.
