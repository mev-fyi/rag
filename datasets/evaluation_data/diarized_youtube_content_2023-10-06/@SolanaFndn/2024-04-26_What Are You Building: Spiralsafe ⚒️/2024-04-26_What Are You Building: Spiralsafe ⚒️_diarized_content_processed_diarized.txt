00:00:04.200 - 00:00:09.582, Speaker A: Today I'm joined by Sabre and I'm very excited about what he's building. So please tell us, what are you building?
00:00:09.718 - 00:00:33.484, Speaker B: Thanks Johannes, for having me. I'm building a spiral safe, which is a seamless way of onboarding users into web3. It's adopting Paschi and Webauthn standard which is supported on all the browsers. Using spiral safe, you don't need to install any extension or apps to interact with chain, so all you need is your biometrics support on all devices and you can have your wallet on cross oss.
00:00:33.604 - 00:00:40.164, Speaker A: That sounds super convenient. I can't wait to get rid of seed phrases. Thank you so much for showing us and we will try it out for sure. Of course.
