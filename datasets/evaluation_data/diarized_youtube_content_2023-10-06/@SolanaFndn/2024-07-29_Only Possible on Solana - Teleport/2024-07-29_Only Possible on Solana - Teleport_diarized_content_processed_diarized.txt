00:00:00.360 - 00:00:55.786, Speaker A: The problem with centralized rideshare is a single company controls the prices and owes it to their shareholders to have to take as much of the fare as possible. That's not good for the drivers, that's not good for the riders. So our vision for transportation is not a single company runs the system, but thousands of small businesses that each make a lot of revenue are building this network together. And it's better for the drivers, it's better for the riders, because suddenly competition returns to the ride share market. Teleport is a new approach to creating an Internet system for delivering services. Riders and drivers work together to build the network, and thus the fees are much lower. Instead of a single company having to build the entire market, the riders and drivers are involved in building the network.
00:00:55.898 - 00:01:11.090, Speaker B: I would ride share for about seven and a half years between Uber and Lyft, about 36,000 passengers. My experience with them has been good in the beginning, but has been declining over time. Their fares have been reduced so much that's going to other places and not to the actual driver.
00:01:11.170 - 00:01:24.646, Speaker A: So whenever you bring a centralized party in, that party gets too much power. By building the rideshare network on an open platform like Solana, we can make sure there's competition between different operators and the prices are better for consumers.
00:01:24.778 - 00:01:35.230, Speaker C: Actually surprising that I'm saving about 15% versus legacy rideshare. And the driver actually makes more than driving on other platforms. So it's a win win for both.
00:01:35.350 - 00:01:43.262, Speaker D: I thought it was really great that on teleport you could use crypto, but you could also do Apple pay or use a credit card. It was really convenient and easy to use.
00:01:43.406 - 00:01:52.566, Speaker A: So the driver makes more, the rider pays less, and the people building the network get rewards on the network that reward them for building the network together.
00:01:52.678 - 00:02:07.428, Speaker B: The rewards are great. As the rewards get higher, you can also get different tiered NFTs where you accumulate as you go. I think teleport is helping the independent contractor who's driving Uber to invest more into their future by gaining these assets over time.
00:02:07.524 - 00:02:32.890, Speaker A: The next stage of crypto adoption is going to be stealth. Millions of people are going to use crypto on a daily basis to order services and to transfer funds without even being aware what the underlying protocols and platforms are. Solana is a pioneer in this space because they've designed a their system to be really fast and really robust for transactions for millions of people.
