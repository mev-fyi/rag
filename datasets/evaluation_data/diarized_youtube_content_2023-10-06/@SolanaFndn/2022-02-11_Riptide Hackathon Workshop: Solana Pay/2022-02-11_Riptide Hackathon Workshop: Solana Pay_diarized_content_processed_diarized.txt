00:00:00.760 - 00:00:23.314, Speaker A: All right, welcome, everybody, to the Riptide workshop on Solanapay. So excited to be here with you today. I'm Josh fried. I am on the payments team at Solana, and I've got a great group, a core group of Solana contributors here today to talk to you about what is going on with Solanapay. I'm going to start with Shiraz, head of payments.
00:00:24.094 - 00:00:24.694, Speaker B: Hey, everyone.
00:00:24.774 - 00:00:38.314, Speaker C: Great to be here. I'm Shiraz and I lead the payments vertical at Solana Labs. And excited to talk to you about rebuilding or building from the ground up the future of payments and commerce on the blockchain and web3.
00:00:38.974 - 00:00:41.914, Speaker A: Next up, we have Ben, who's PM for payments.
00:00:42.734 - 00:00:49.634, Speaker D: Hey, my name is Ben Mills, recently joined labs to work on payments. I'm excited to talk with you all today.
00:00:50.454 - 00:00:53.794, Speaker A: We've got Jordan, our head dev for payments.
00:00:54.554 - 00:01:02.694, Speaker B: Hey, I'm Jordan. I work at Solana Labs, on the engineering team, on wallet adapter and Solanapay, and a lot of the DAP integrations.
00:01:03.954 - 00:01:07.934, Speaker A: And Spencer, also on the core payments BD team.
00:01:08.714 - 00:01:14.514, Speaker D: Hey, everyone. We also recently joined, similar to Ben.
00:01:14.594 - 00:01:16.698, Speaker C: After spending 18 years at Google.
00:01:16.786 - 00:01:17.814, Speaker D: Happy to be here.
00:01:18.314 - 00:01:19.854, Speaker C: We had some red pills.
00:01:21.414 - 00:01:29.754, Speaker A: All right, we're going to kick it off with Shiraz, who's going to give us a high level description of Solanapay, what it is and why it matters.
00:01:30.334 - 00:02:40.254, Speaker C: Well, that's an easy one, because Solanapay is dead simple. And it's basically premise on the whole reason blockchains exist, right? Which is to make the movement of a digital asset from one account to another account easy and instant and frictionless. And even though blockchains have been around for a while, we haven't really seen that in consumer to merchant payments because the Solana blockchain is performant and it has scalability and very fast settlement and low costs. What drew me to Solana in general was those attributes could enable a new consumer to merchant payment system. So Solana Pay is just very basic, simple protocol that governs a handshake between a merchant wallet and consumer wallet. I'll have Jordan talk a little bit more about the architecture of Solanapay, but that's kind of the foundational piece of it and that's what we released. I think what's interesting is not so much about just the payments aspect of it, but what is possible to build on top of this protocol.
00:02:40.254 - 00:03:15.696, Speaker C: If you think about commerce, offers loyalty, the ability for a merchant to engage with the consumer directly in their wallet. You'll hear the term no intermediaries many times. Because I think one of the great things about the Solana pay protocol and framework is that it really is about removing an intermediary. So traditional intermediaries, whether it's a payment network or a bank or a company like Google or Apple, they want to be in between the merchant and the customer because they need to, because there's friction in payments. And then they're also like, hey, we'll build this cool stuff. And by the way, we'll collect the data. You don't really need the data.
00:03:15.696 - 00:03:35.484, Speaker C: We'll figure out what to do with the data. All of that stuff, I think, can change now that we have blockchains that can enable this. So that's at a high level. It's about Jordan. If you want to talk a little bit about at the protocol layer, like what we've released, and just kind of the. Or, Ben, both of you kind of jump in on the protocol side.
00:03:38.584 - 00:03:40.764, Speaker B: Ben, why don't you handle this?
00:03:42.394 - 00:04:20.686, Speaker D: So, I mean, the reality is solanapay at the protocol level is very simple. Like, we wanted to make something really easy to use. And that mostly solved the problem of how will merchants, or really, dapps in general, communicate with a consumer's wallet? Like, the more consistent we make that, the easier it is for the wallet ecosystem to grow different wallets to come out. And the app or the merchant doesn't have to know which wallet to support and which not. They just support our interface. And that enables easy communication between the merchant and the wallet, which is the consumer. Jordan's probably going to walk through kind of, like some basics of how the code works, like what the spec actually is.
00:04:20.686 - 00:04:47.704, Speaker D: You can find all this on GitHub or just go to solanapay.com to see all that. But, yeah, I mean, at the core, that is what we've built. I think what we're looking to do next is how do we want to expand the standard? Like, what different features do we need to add in terms of letting people do more complex payment flows? Like, we might tease some interesting alpha around that later on. But with that, Jordan, are you ready to kind of walk through some code examples?
00:04:48.804 - 00:05:39.864, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I guess I want to lay out, like, the case for Solanapay that I see that I think is really interesting. So in the flows that we have with Dapps today, you have browser extensions for crypto native users that connect to decentralized apps and you run transactions over them. And this is pretty separate from e commerce, and it's also separate from a lot of what people think of as like real world utility for crypto. And that's, I think, what we hope we can start to solve with Solanapay. So at a basic level, Solanapay is a variation of a bitcoin protocol. Bit 21 is what it's called.
00:05:39.864 - 00:06:08.994, Speaker B: And this is just like a payment link specification. And I'll jump through a little bit of sort of like what's in the spec, I guess, because I know that developers don't read specs and I usually don't read specs, so we tried to write a specific that was not much like a spec that developers would like to read. So I hope after this, you guys go ahead and read it because it's pretty short and sweet if some Easter.
00:06:09.034 - 00:06:10.414, Speaker A: Eggs in there or what?
00:06:11.554 - 00:06:24.334, Speaker B: We have Easter eggs in there, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess I'll jump into. Let's see. Hold on. Got to grant this some kind of system.
00:06:33.294 - 00:06:40.758, Speaker C: Do we lose them? Jordan, while we wait, why don't you give the verbal overview of the spec?
00:06:40.886 - 00:07:31.578, Speaker D: Yeah, well, actually there's a great question in the chat that I think we can glue go off of. So someone asked specs tn or, sorry, asked what's the pros and cons of a traditional pos and solana pay? It's a great question. I mean, I think that at its core, to me, what I get excited about, about blockchain based commerce is there's going to be much more composability. So, for instance, someone running a store today, they have to make a choice of what POS system they're going to go with, whether it's clover or square or something like that. And they're really like, that decision locks them in into an ecosystem like they are now. Like anything they want to do, they need to make sure it works with whatever POS system they choose. The vision that we have for how this looks, a blockchain centered world, is all these different things can fit together without permission.
00:07:31.578 - 00:08:05.444, Speaker D: So I want to build some interesting new feature for a coffee shop. Like, I want to build a reward system for a coffee shop that's going to increase their conversion, increase their retention, like all these great things. And I can walk into any coffee shop and be like, guess what? All you need to do is connect your wallet and you can just start using this. Like, there is no integration with whatever pos you're doing because the merchant, just like all users on blockchain, own their data. And like, because they own their data, they're free to do with it. Whatever they want is the like the kind of crux of how commerce on chain is going to be different.
00:08:06.944 - 00:08:10.644, Speaker C: Looks like we got the presentation or Jordan's screen up.
00:08:11.264 - 00:09:13.438, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I had to grant chrome permission to share the screen here. Cool. So this is the basic spec. I think that as the protocol matures, as maybe we get somebody who's actually good at writing specs in a formal way, we might formalize this, but I hope we stay true to the spirit of keeping it simple and easy to understand and easy to implement. So as I mentioned, this draws from BiP 21, which you can check out, but there's like a payment link that has a Solana scheme, a recipient, which is a public key address of user or a merchant, and then there's a bunch of optional parameters and we can just briefly walk through what those are and what the purpose of this is in a basic way. The problem that you have is that in a real world setting, you don't have a connection to a wallet.
00:09:13.438 - 00:09:53.148, Speaker B: And you need to find a way to have a wallet like your cryptocurrency wallet, be able to send tokens or soul or something, interact in some way with a merchant. So this URL allows for a standard to encode a payment request. That's the way to think about this. So the merchant has, they're receiving address which is just a native sole address, it's not like an associated token address or anything like that. And they provide this in the payment link. You could share this among friends. So you could have this link or a QR code based on this link.
00:09:53.148 - 00:10:36.120, Speaker B: Be something that you send to someone and they can send payment without copying public keys around, which is weird and error prone. You can encode this in like an NFC. So there's an open issue on the GitHub right now where somebody's already done this in just the last couple of days. They bought some NFC tags and they were able to launch wallets using this. So I think that could be really interesting for like contactless payments for how to do that. So you specify like a recipient, you specify an amount, this is optional. So in the case of like tipping or you know, you're asking your friend for money or something like that, the amount can be specified by the user that's sending it.
00:10:36.120 - 00:11:06.164, Speaker B: If it's not provided in the request, you specify an SPL token field. This is like the public key of the token mint. It's not the public key of a token account, it's the token mint. So for USCC or whatever, this would be the address that you associate with the USDC mint on Mainnet. And then we get into. I'll skip over reference real quick, it's important. We'll come back to it and we'll talk about some of the display fields.
00:11:06.164 - 00:11:48.054, Speaker B: So the label and message field, these aren't recorded on chain at all. These are just given to the wallet to show to the user to describe the transaction in some way. So like when the user scans a QR code or when they read this NFC, they have some context for the payment. And this is just like a UTF eight field, it needs to be URL encoded, but we keep this flexible in the spec. So you might be able to encode different data formats in this depending on what different wallets choose to support. So you could have structured data inside this field in some way. And then there's a memo field.
00:11:48.054 - 00:12:43.390, Speaker B: This is a text field that does get recorded on chain. It's not part of the state, but it is part of what validators record in transactions. And you can see this in the explorer or something like that, but it allows you to basically record some text message on chain along with the transaction that occurs. Then we'll talk about references. References are a way to specify public keys that are going to be added to the transaction. This talks a little bit about in the spec what the purpose of this is. In Solana you have to declare the account keys that you're going to reference in a transaction upfront, and they don't necessarily need to correspond with accounts that exist on chain, but validators will index by these keys.
00:12:43.390 - 00:13:31.538, Speaker B: So when you specify this, it allows you to look up the transaction by this reference id that you know in advance. So in a normal flow, like when a user scans a QR code or NFC, and then they pay as a merchant or operating a point of sale system, how do you find out about that transaction? Because you don't know who's sending it and you don't know the signature until after they sign it. These reference fields are a way to do that. So you basically create a unique pub key, you attach it to the request, the wallet includes it in the transaction, it doesn't do anything. Then it allows you to use this RPC method, getsignatures for address, to be able to look that transaction up, and we'll talk about how this actually works in the point of sale system. That's it. That's all there is in the spec.
00:13:31.538 - 00:13:59.894, Speaker B: There's some examples for how you might format this thing beyond that in documentation details for how you'd integrate this as a merchant or a wallet, support the protocol in different ways. And those are pretty full descriptions that are given in there, but we can look at how the code for what you would do different things.
00:14:02.514 - 00:14:59.694, Speaker C: I would be curious, Ben, maybe if we take a step back as putting your product head on, thinking about fundamentally how like what this changes in a point of sale environment, and then thinking about like, what is the infrastructure that needs to be built around it. And like, maybe let me just prompt you with like the whole point of this is that because we have a blockchain that can settle funds close to, you know, in seconds or less, we can have this protocol allow a user to send, let's say USDC to the merchant instantly and then the merchant now with future iteration of this, can have the consumer's public key and access to their wallet to engage in commerce. How do you think this kind of changes the game from a commerce perspective? Thinking about traditional payments versus what's happening now?
00:15:00.354 - 00:15:01.298, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:15:01.346 - 00:15:32.278, Speaker D: I mean, I think maybe just to start with the devs and what gets built. One of the hardest problems with doing really anything with payments in web two is there's a lot of red tape. Like you need to be PCI compliant, you need to handle security. There's a lot of things that could go wrong. One of the beautiful aspects, there's a lot of those hard problems that go away now. There's definitely some worse problems, like there's way web3 to lose money in a way that's totally irrecoverable. That's actually pretty hard to get with web two.
00:15:32.278 - 00:16:06.214, Speaker D: So there's definitely some rough edges. But on a whole, we really are concerns a lot more, in my opinion. Like we're now like the merchant apps or commerce experiences. We can build them in a way where we know we can't accidentally take the user's money without their consent because the wallet is on the app now. And that level of separation, I actually think, frees up developers to be like, try things, ship experiments, move a lot faster. One of the hardest problems with big consumer payments companies is you want to be experimental. That's the right way to build web software.
00:16:06.214 - 00:17:02.850, Speaker D: If you're going to be working with consumers and you really can't be because you're dealing with their money and you're doing it in ways that you really have control over all their money. I think that's one way I think things are going to change the other way, I'd say, is the interesting aspect coming from the web tool world of doing payments for years is a lot of the payments problems are really solved. We didn't need to build, let's call it a stripe or a brain tree for blockchains, because frankly, if you just go read the Solana API, that is a fairly robust way to make any kind of transaction you'd ever want. Those have been solved. But I think what that enables now is all of us, as an industry of builders, to say, let's start to think about the next level of distractions that we would talk a lot about at Venmo was merchants. Their payment processing needs have been solved. They don't need anything new there.
00:17:02.850 - 00:17:55.874, Speaker D: What they need is customer acquisition. So I think I challenge everyone here to think about what are the needs that businesses have that are beyond the just basics, beyond just getting paid. And I think that looks different for every business. Think about ticketing for a second, which is something that I'm sure all of us have thought a lot about with nfts. But by using NFTs as the method of exchange for tickets, you take this huge problem for the ticketing industry, which is the secondary market, and actually just turn it into an advantage where now this is something that you should just embrace because it doesn't hurt you at all and it's actually probably better for the user. So I think those are the things that we're going to, I think, start seeing smart teams explore over the next couple of years is like, how do you basically use these new primitives to do things that were just impossible in web two Shiraz, Josh Jordan, anything you'd add to that?
00:17:58.454 - 00:18:24.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think one thing that we're excited about is thinking about commerce. What does commerce and loyalty look like? So, for example, like the ability for a merchant to provide some discount or benefit to users based on token they have in their wallet. Right. That could be a simple way. Like that's kind of reinventing loyalty, which it's just so much more frictionless and easy. Right? I'm immersion. I could.
00:18:24.180 - 00:19:03.264, Speaker C: I could mint some NFT that represents like some affinity or loyalty to my brand. And now using this protocol, what are the kinds of experiences I can enable for customers that walk in that maybe, I don't know, but I know that they have that token in their wallet. And because of that, I can enable certain experiences. Like that's. That's what the cool stuff that can be built. Like, we can. You know, from a developer and entrepreneur perspective, it's like if you could rebuild loyalty programs from scratch, but you now have the infrastructure of the blockchain and one of the best things about building in this space is that I think you had said this, Ben.
00:19:03.264 - 00:19:32.406, Speaker C: The hardest part about building a payments or commerce startup is like just the core payments infrastructure, and that's all built. We have the blockchain. The most native transaction on the blockchain is moving, you know, transferring digital assets. That's all solved. So you can now be like, that infrastructure is there for me now. I can build this, the layers on top that I can monetize or build new infrastructure on top of our layers on top of that, compete. So you can build platforms on top of this.
00:19:32.406 - 00:20:09.204, Speaker C: You can build end consumer products, you can build end merchant products. I mean, even for merchants. Like we did this very simple POS app. But the reality for the commercial opportunity for Devs is to build like custodial services, dashboards and reporting reconciliation, all that sort of stuff. We have someone reach out that wants to do both acceptance of USDC and doing payroll in that. Right. All the stuff that can be built on top of the protocol, I think, for a developer is what's really cool and interesting.
00:20:09.504 - 00:20:10.564, Speaker B: Payroll.
00:20:10.864 - 00:20:11.656, Speaker D: Go ahead, Josh.
00:20:11.760 - 00:20:42.784, Speaker A: I was just going to add to that. Generally speaking, I feel like I'm excited about putting these amazing capabilities into the hands of small businesses. And these were out of reach for small businesses for a long time. These are the types of things we're talking about. These loyalty programs or these other types of consumer merchant relationships were really the provenance of targets and Walmarts and the big players of the world that now we can really enable for almost anyone through the blockchain and the infrastructure that we built. I'm super excited about that.
00:20:46.964 - 00:20:49.104, Speaker B: I think payroll is a really interesting area.
00:20:49.444 - 00:21:16.294, Speaker D: You want to talk about an industry that's pretty solidified and hasn't changed much. It's payroll. It's some of the oldest payment tech that's out there. But now we can do things, and there's already teams exploring this, like streaming payments. Like, think how great it is, especially if you're someone who's not making much money to get your money instantly, every day or even every second like that is at a legitimate value that you cannot do today. That I think is going to be better for workers and better for us as a culture.
00:21:18.354 - 00:21:44.382, Speaker C: One of the biggest problems which, if you look at it, every problem is really an opportunity, right area of friction as an opportunity for someone to build a new product. So to me, the biggest problem, and I feel like this is not controversial at all, is onboarding people, onboarding consumers, but also now onboarding merchants. So. Oh, great. Like, merchants have heard about this cool Solana pay thing. Oh, I can settle instantly and I don't have to pay 3%. Awesome.
00:21:44.382 - 00:22:47.334, Speaker C: How do I get started? And right now we don't. We need, we need developers, founders, entrepreneurs to think about how do I build tooling and onboarding features and infrastructure to make it really simple for both merchants and consumers? But we can even think about merchants, right? That's some, like, people are trying to solve the consumer problem, but now we're saying, like, there's an entire market, entire market of small businesses that would love to leverage a system like this, but we are at the protocol level, so we're just defining specifications and standards, and then suddenly we've got customers that want to use this. There's a huge gap there for people to come in, step in and build the tooling because the protocol is not the end answer. It's just the most foundational thing. So be interesting, Jordan and Ben, to get your thoughts on what are some of the hard problems on onboarding, either on the merchant or consumer side that you think would be exciting for developers to tackle.
00:22:47.714 - 00:23:39.786, Speaker D: And one thing on onboarding, just to call out, I mean, like, if I was in the audience or thinking about building something on Solana pay, like, one of the things I think about is like, hey, there's lots of, like, really, like, good companies that are in web two that are providing like, payment services. Like, some of the hottest startups are still in that, like, they're going to do this. So, like, why should I? I think the thing I would challenge everyone to think about is, like, you can, you can think about what businesses look like very differently in blockchains. Like, we can build much smaller, much more efficient businesses or potentially even daos that can exist and get composed together to build these things. So don't just assume that the brain trees and stripes of the world are going to come in and solve the problems for everyone. There is, I think, a lot of room for us to rethink a lot of these concepts in a crypto native way. So in terms of what actually is needed, to me it's really basic stuff.
00:23:39.786 - 00:24:13.624, Speaker D: It's like, hey, I'm a merchant. I know nothing about blockchains. Like, I just want to get started and I don't want to shoot myself in the foot. This is especially important if we're talking about who, frankly, are probably not going to be tech savvy. It's like, how can we do that? How can we get them to manage their keys and do all these things without being effectively another centralized entity. These are hard problems, but I think there's a lot of people that are exploring solutions like social recovery, whether it's using sharding private keys across multiple sources so no one entity controls it. Like I believe.
00:24:13.624 - 00:25:03.554, Speaker D: I'm a firm believer that self custody is a core tenet to this whole thing working. And I think if enough of us really put our minds. So that's the merchant side, the consumer side is also very similar concerns, like they need to be able to manage their keys in a way that is transparent to them and that they can't screw up. But there's also some more things. I mean, the reality is all this here we're degens, we're keeping all our money, hopefully, like our total net worth at crypto, never touch fiat ever again. But the reality is, like most they need on ramps, they need off ramps, and they need those on ramps and arm ramps to work really, really well. They need things like the ability to be able to instantly move fiat from a stable point in minutes or seconds.
00:25:03.554 - 00:25:59.014, Speaker D: I'd also, I think like compliance and regulation is something none of us like to think about, but the reality is it's here. And like, if we're moving money and we want to try to, like what to try to do it in a way that the general public is going to do, we're going to need to grapple with some of those things. But I also think there's some opportunities to push the envelope on how we're letting regulation impact ux. Like some of the best consumer payments products all have, like some of the most creative, like, legal and compliance teams out there because they're looking at the laws and trying to figure out how can we do the right thing here but not get in the user's way. And so some of the things I would love to see is it absolutely is ways to do fiat onboarding that has limits that require very, very little from the user. In terms of KYC, those solutions exist out there. I'd love to see us push the envelope there.
00:25:59.014 - 00:26:33.762, Speaker D: I also think that the decentralized identity solutions are getting a lot better. And again, I recognize how sensitive a topic that is about associating PII, or personal identifiable information with your key. In a lot of ways, it's very against the ethos of crypto. I see this as we need to give people options. I can say, hey, it doesn't matter how I'm managing my keys. If I have this token which represents that I have been Kyc, I'm good. That gives me the option where it's like, I can have other wallets that might not have that token.
00:26:33.762 - 00:27:00.174, Speaker D: I could still have wallets that are fully unknown. That's my right as a person. But if I need to work with a real business that has compliance obligations, I can always use my wallet with my decentralized identity token. So that's another area where I think we're going to need to spend time as an industry and ecosystem. I encourage everyone to check out civic. I think they're doing a lot in this space. I think there's some folks from civic here in Seattle today.
00:27:00.174 - 00:27:03.584, Speaker D: Go find them. Go find me, and then let's talk about it.
00:27:03.924 - 00:28:03.116, Speaker B: Yeah. I think one of the common things we see in line with that is how merchants think about consumer protection. So, like, I think that everybody's seen, like, escrow tutorials on Solana, but escrow, or like, some means of allowing things like disputes, chargebacks, these things can be decentralized. You could have a dao who's responsible for this. So it's not like two or three entities controlling the chargeback process. This could be something that consumers still have choice in and merchants have choice in based on the track record of those companies, not just based on fiat. So I think that, like, there's a lot of opportunity in how we think about how regular users, and as we grow this space to a large number of these users, how are they going to interface with this, and how do we, like, flatten the learning curve little bit for this? I think that's like the same with fiat on ramps.
00:28:03.116 - 00:29:00.164, Speaker B: If there's a way that, you know, is sufficiently compliant to allow users to on ramp with small amounts, I think that lets them, like, get their feet wet, lets them start to get familiar with crypto, at least in a way that I think a lot of us are familiar with. Like, probably the first time that you went on a depth or something like that and started making trades on there. It's very foreign. There's like, crazy shit happening all over the screen. And it's a very immersive experience. And I think we all understand crypto and the communication around crypto to be very immersive, but that immersiveness is also a wall for new users, and I think that we need to find ways to make those things easier to onboard with. And then they can really start to see, hey, this is actually really fun, and get, like, a sense of joy and exploration through it, and you can't have that when you're just like overwhelmed with complexity.
00:29:01.064 - 00:29:15.844, Speaker A: So there's. Yeah, I just want to. This is a great topic. I think there's been a little bit of chat in the chat box about this. So the biggest challenge to onboarding. What would you guys say is the biggest challenge to onboarding either on the merchant side or the consumer side?
00:29:17.164 - 00:29:20.864, Speaker C: Well, I think. Go ahead.
00:29:21.844 - 00:29:37.144, Speaker D: I was going to say for the consumer it's KyC. It's like, what is the right way to collect Kyc? I think for the merchant side it is probably custody. How are they going to manage their keys in a way that's secure? That would be my guess.
00:29:38.284 - 00:30:21.920, Speaker C: Well, I was going to take it up a little bit higher level than just ux. It's just like if you take a Normie and you like, try and get them to onboard a wallet and like seed phrases and this and that, it's just, it's, it's designed. Every experience has been designed for crypto natives, which is fine. That's by design, right. We're people in the ecosystem, but if we want to start reaching people outside of the ecosystem, I think ux usability and design needs to, to be kind of more front and center. And then from there, everything, you know, there are second order problems like Kyc. I think that's probably for me the biggest problem to solve in onboarding, which maybe is less of an engineering thing and more of a design thing.
00:30:21.920 - 00:30:28.048, Speaker C: But did you have Jordan? Were you going to chime in there?
00:30:28.136 - 00:30:56.064, Speaker B: No, I agree with those things. I think that it's, you know, it's normal for us as engineers to think about how to solve technical problems. And I think as the technical problems in blockchain have gotten to a higher level of abstraction, like, we have a lot of the primitives that we need to build higher level applications, we need to start thinking in a higher level way about how those applications can be used by people that aren't already sold on this vision.
00:30:56.964 - 00:31:56.784, Speaker C: I think one thing you had mentioned, Jordan, that prompted a thought was mentioned, for example, chargebacks. A lot of, one of the common questions we get are people asking about some of the features that have been present in traditional payment networks and sort of an expectation that these would port over into a blockchain payment system. And we argue that they don't necessarily all need to port over. So, for example, the notion of a, a dispute or a chargeback for going, you know, to a local convenience store and buying coffee or, you know, milk, you really probably don't need chargeback protections. Right. It's. So why should the, why should the system support or underwrite that? However, the example I like to give is the cruise liner one where if you buy, you know, a ticket to carnival cruise and it's eight months in the future and it's $4,000, and they go under, you know, in three months, then, you know, you want to be able to dispute that charge.
00:31:56.784 - 00:33:07.246, Speaker C: So that's an opportunity to be like, okay, for certain types of transactions, maybe a merchant would want to offer, you know, some sort of protection. So what does that look like on chain? Is it an escrow program? Sorry? Is it a smart contract that manages funds in escrow? And then can these disputes be resolved through, you know, programmatically or, you know, on chain, or is there off chain data? So is, is there a role for someone to build oracles for dispute management? So the cruise line example could be a simple one. It's either a binary event. Did that cruise line take off on this day or not? If it did, then submit that on chain, and then the program knows, okay, I can release these funds, because I know that some Oracle told me that this cruise liner took off, and I can now release the 2000 out of the $4,000 that were held in escrow. I mean, in traditional payments, it's the acquiring bank that holds back those funds and for some of these higher risk ones. So in some ways, I think it's very interesting to think about, like, can we build some of these features on chain? But they don't necessarily. It's not like a blunt object that every transaction needs chargeback protection.
00:33:07.246 - 00:33:20.734, Speaker C: That's the beauty of a composable system where it's like, for, you know, the coffee shop that in Redwood City, it doesn't, probably don't need chargeback. How often are you going to dispute your latte.
00:33:24.994 - 00:33:48.570, Speaker A: In the chat about what we're doing or what is happening on the BD sales and marketing side to onboard merchants to use Solana pay? I will say it's still very early. We've only been live for a week, and we have a tremendous amount of inbound interest. Hundreds and hundreds of small businesses have reached out to us thus far, and we're putting that strategy together right now.
00:33:48.602 - 00:34:05.728, Speaker C: On how to get them. Here's the simple answer. Somebody go build a company to service. It could be a services company. Right now, you're looking at the BD team for Solanapay. And, like, we're NGMI. If me and Josh are responsible for scaling up our merchant network.
00:34:05.728 - 00:34:25.840, Speaker C: So if someone wants to build a merchant acquisition services company. I mean, services companies maybe are not as sexy, but like, there's some, there's money to be made. Like, go help small businesses get set up or build it, build a platform to make it easy. Build self servicing tools. Like, that's all stuff we would welcome people to build. Right?
00:34:25.872 - 00:34:32.259, Speaker A: I meant unless Max variant says, give me a month and I'll have something. So, yeah, please.
00:34:32.391 - 00:35:11.410, Speaker C: Sounds good. Honestly, I think like this is, you know, where, you know, it's in a way we're like just presenting gifts to founders and developers to be like, I mean, there's like probably ten different ideas that have come off the launch of Solanapay. And like, one of the things that's interesting from where we sit is like, we're not in the position to build end products and services and platforms. We're, we're building at the pro layer. We're building. We're providing the building blocks for devs to build, like new kind of features or companies or, you know, platforms. So that's, that's what I would say.
00:35:11.602 - 00:35:24.322, Speaker A: Let's do a quick. What's the best way to reach us for these various questions or collaboration points? I mean, I know there's a lot of different channels. So for example, Jordan, if somebody wants to reach you, where's a great place to have a chat with you on.
00:35:24.338 - 00:35:25.338, Speaker D: This kind of stuff?
00:35:25.506 - 00:35:47.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say so. There's a Solana pay channel in the discord. If you have the developer role and discord which you can add for your account, I would say join there. If it's like developer focused, if it's more business development or like onboarding focused, I would say Josh Razor. Ben.
00:35:48.914 - 00:35:50.500, Speaker A: Hanging out, where are you spending time?
00:35:50.642 - 00:36:13.824, Speaker D: Where can you chat? I'm definitely in that channel with Jordan, so if you do have questions, feel free to bring them there. But more generally, I think I'm getting a lot of people talking to me on Twitter. So my DM's are open. I'm Ben E. Mills on Twitter. Just dm me. And I'd say especially for the folks across in Seattle, I'm hopefully going to be down there in a few, an hour or two.
00:36:13.824 - 00:36:24.834, Speaker D: I'd love to talk to people, especially people who are interested in talking about things like how do Daos fit into commerce, how do we make this ecosystem composable, all those things. I'd love to talk to anyone who's interested today.
00:36:25.774 - 00:36:45.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm oshfried. J o s h f r I e d on twitter also. Yeah, send me a message. There we have an intake form@solanapay.com where you can let us know what it is you're building for who, what you're thinking about. Or maybe you're just a merchant that's interested again. Like I said, we've had hundreds reach out already.
00:36:45.394 - 00:36:50.584, Speaker A: Fill that out and we'll get back to you soon. Shiraz, what's the best way to find you?
00:36:52.124 - 00:36:53.224, Speaker C: Call Josh.
00:36:55.164 - 00:36:58.664, Speaker A: I'm not leaving out my phone number on this twitch stream, so you're going to have to try again.
00:36:59.604 - 00:37:13.242, Speaker C: I'm old. You send me a fax or I have a telephone. Like the rotary telephone. Nice. Yeah, I forget my Twitter handle. I think it's Cheryl share.
00:37:13.378 - 00:37:14.730, Speaker A: Yeah, something like that.
00:37:14.842 - 00:37:21.002, Speaker C: Sorry, wait, I wanted to. Josh, did you have a question?
00:37:21.058 - 00:37:22.534, Speaker D: No, no, go ahead, take it.
00:37:23.514 - 00:38:02.274, Speaker C: Ben, I don't know if you wanted to kind of go like pie in the sky and talk about like, what could be exciting for everyone in this space as we think about like the next five years. And like you mentioned that, like, like, what is decentralized commerce look like? Like, how do we, how do we build, like, how do we build a, you know, how does Linux analogy become like the payment system, right? Like, you know, where it's not run by a few entrenched, you know, multibillion dollar companies, but it's a community building. The commerce rails.
00:38:03.994 - 00:38:39.602, Speaker D: I want to use as an example because I actually think process on here stems from the Unix philosophy of do one thing well. Unix system is so composable because they really had a focus on. I'm not going to make these big bloated programs. I'm going to make them do one thing really well and make it, unfortunately web. I'd encourage everyone here to read a lot of the writing by Chris Dixon. If you haven't, like web two, like, flips companies into this value extraction mode, which basically means they're just going to start expanding. Like, you can see that with all the major tech companies.
00:38:39.602 - 00:39:16.034, Speaker D: It's like everyone's doing everything. Like, I think if you were to talk to us, any one of us, in like 2008, and you're like, do you think PayPal or Facebook is going to be like a media company and a payments company? No, like, of course not. But like, that is what they are now is because that is the best path they have to succeeding in web two. What I want to see is a lot more fragmentation, which, similar to the example we talked about, transaction insurance or protection. It's like let the user and the merchant choose, decide what they need in that moment. Don't force things on them. There is no one size fits all.
00:39:16.034 - 00:39:50.004, Speaker D: Because the other thing to keep in mind, payments is notoriously hard to do. Cross border blockchains are global. Solana Pay is a global payments network. Solana is a global p two P network. These things don't exist easily right now in web two, and we have them basically out the gate in web3. And I think that really just changed a little bit more concrete, I think. I believe we should see things like fraud services, potentially even things like fulfillment and shipping services, maybe even customer support.
00:39:50.004 - 00:40:29.426, Speaker D: These are things that can start to exist as standalone entities. Maybe they're companies, maybe they're daos. I mean, I think that's for all of us to explore and figure out together and probably make a bunch of mistakes. But I think if we do this right, we will become much, much more like, I can tell you, like, one of the things that it really frustrates me about web two payments is so I was a very early engineer at Braintree, and, like, Braintree, just like stripe. Like, we make the claim that, like, work solving payments for merchants. Like, we, like, we handle this. Like, when I would go visit merchants, like, we visit Uber or Airbnb, and I realized I'm like, holy shit, Uber has more years than Braintree.
00:40:29.426 - 00:40:51.846, Speaker D: Overall, how does this make sense? Like, how, like, what is, like, wait a second. Like, our whole value prop is like, we're solving payments for you, but you still have to hire a hundred plus person payments team. Like, that doesn't add up. I think that is the reality right now. Payments is a really, really hard. There's a lot of domain specific things to figure out. There's fraud, there's reconciliation.
00:40:51.846 - 00:41:20.746, Speaker D: The list goes on. And I think if you have the opportunity, every company, and really ask, what have you built for payments? You actually see we're just duplicating the same stuff over and over again, and we're all doing it slightly differently. And the reality is just inefficient. And so my vision for what commerce looks like on Shane is we just stopped that. We start solving problems once the right way, and all benefit as we improve that and contribute to that. The reality is, let's talk about fraud for a second. Cash app.
00:41:20.746 - 00:41:57.190, Speaker D: Most consumer payment companies are losing an incredible amount of money to fraud today. Imagine if we all just could share a black credit card. That's bad. I spent time kind of like collaborators that were at square and some others while I was at Venmo. And, like, a lot of us wanted to do it, but there was just too much, you know, like, back and forth and like, the teams not being comfortable sharing data. And it's just like, this sucks because the reality is this would be better for all of us if we did it, but we couldn't. Those are the things that will be possible as commerce is on chain.
00:41:57.190 - 00:42:36.344, Speaker D: So, yeah, that's a little hint. I mean, I think there's a lot of other things that we probably don't have enough time to talk about. Like, how do companies change? Like, how does payroll change? Like, how does, like, how does global commerce change? Like, there's a team that I know right now is working on. How can we focus on, like, countries that are traditionally, like, don't have the infrastructure to run. Like, there are people there that actually can provide little services. Like they're like designers or engineers. They're people out there that live in these countries that don't really have an easy way to basically, like, be a contractor to a us based entity with Solana, they're going to be able to do that now, and teams are building software for them to get that done.
00:42:36.344 - 00:42:42.244, Speaker D: That's awesome. That is going to change the supply chain and how we think about labor overall.
00:42:42.904 - 00:43:09.832, Speaker A: All right, so we are close to wrap. Just got to throw a couple of plugs out there. So if you haven't registered at our Riptide hackathon yet, it's solana.com riptide, obviously. Please register, find a team or build solo if you'd like. But there's plenty of people still looking for collaborators. A lot of these ideas that we talked about or hinted at and some that we didn't are actually listed on the ideas tab at the Riptide website.
00:43:09.832 - 00:43:35.588, Speaker A: So it's solana.com riptide ideas. And for the first time, we really laid out some visuals, some front ends. We put together some loom videos explaining some of these ideas. So if you haven't really taken a chance to dive in there, please do. We spent a lot of time front loading that with these ideas because we want to see some of these things get built. And again, if you want to do something that's not listed there, that's great, too.
00:43:35.588 - 00:43:51.204, Speaker A: There was a bunch of ideas that came out of this chat today that I think we just didn't have time to put into visuals, but I think would make incredibly cool companies that would make the future of commerce and payments a reality. So just to wrap up, any last thoughts? Anybody want to jump in?
00:43:52.584 - 00:44:21.940, Speaker C: Maybe wanted to Jordan the comment. Let me ask you this question, like, if I'm a developer, let's say I'm a front end developer, or I write server side code, but I'm like, I don't really know rust, or I don't really want to learn blockchain. To me, it seems like there's still lots of opportunity for developers that aren't kind of the lowest level of the stack. I'm just curious to get your comment like what you would say to a developer that's like, for example, just knows, like React or Java.
00:44:22.012 - 00:45:07.596, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess I would first say to check out the really excellent Solana cookbook that provides a lot of examples for both how to do stuff with Solana programs and then also how to build clients for Solana programs. It's possible to do a ton of stuff on Solana without writing a program. We started working on Solanapay. I think whatever the code in GitHub goes back to October, it was public even then. One of the things that we considered prior to that was writing a program, and we decided that we didn't need to for what we needed to build. If you think about it in that way, Solana Pay is built without rust.
00:45:07.596 - 00:45:51.852, Speaker B: It's just JavaScript. It's JavaScript and react. You can build things on top of Solanapay that are just JavaScript or React or whatever web two stack you're familiar with, whether that's e commerce or something else. You don't need to jump in and write programs. You don't need a Solana program centric model, even for your business. If you understand how that stuff works, if you understand the runtime, if you can do those things, that's great, because it'll expand how you can think about the problem, but it's not a prerequisite to do. I think that if anybody can take something away from how the Solana pay system works, it'll just be that you can go to the POS app itself.
00:45:51.852 - 00:46:17.984, Speaker B: It's just like a react app that runs in the browser. All the demos that you've seen in coffee shops or whatever, you don't even need to know how to build a native app. It's just a small react app that's there. You can take it and you can modify it to do all kinds of things. That demo where somebody was dynamically minting nfts and sending them to somebody's wallet, that's like a modified version of the POS app, and you can think of a lot of different ways to do that that don't require that you write a program.
00:46:18.404 - 00:46:54.444, Speaker C: What's cool? Because again, using the POS app as an example, imagine tasking someone with building a point of sale system, and you would imagine like, oh, man, I have to build an entire payment stack. And it's like, no, you actually just need to build a very simple front end. And then from there, it's like all of the bells and whistles that you want to make it productized for your segment if it's a small business. So, like, how do I onboard them? How do I make play? And that all seems like much more accessible development for people that maybe have kind of more traditional development backgrounds.
00:46:55.984 - 00:46:56.600, Speaker D: Yep.
00:46:56.712 - 00:47:14.678, Speaker A: I think I'm getting told we're out of time. So once again, solana.com riptide. Sign up there, register now. It's going to through the middle of march, I believe. And if you need ideas, contact one of us or check out the ideas tab. Solana.com
00:47:14.678 - 00:47:30.190, Speaker A: riptide slash ideas. I want to thank shiraz, Ben, Jordan and everybody on the payments team here at Solana Labs for getting this out the door. We're really excited to see what you guys build. Let's do this. Let's do this together.
00:47:30.342 - 00:47:31.142, Speaker C: Lfg.
00:47:31.278 - 00:47:32.194, Speaker A: Lfg.
00:47:33.454 - 00:47:33.974, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
