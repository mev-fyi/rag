00:00:09.200 - 00:00:39.644, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Recovering from last night? I think, you know, at this point, hopefully everybody's woken up. I don't know if Bernd is awake under those glasses. We'll see. We'll see. Thanks, everybody, for coming. We have an incredible panel here, a mix of folks who have been building on Solana from the early days, which really isn't too long ago in real time, to folks who are recent entrants with incredible success.
00:00:39.644 - 00:01:39.340, Speaker A: And so today we're going to talk about this transformation to the creator economy that we're in the middle of right now. We're going to think about how each of our panelists here are empowering creators and helping us transform our real world and Internet economy to one that's better for creators. We're going to go around and kind of discuss some individual questions for each of the panelists on stage, and then we'll open it up to a bit more of a greenfield discussion afterwards. So first, Sam, back in June, when the NFT ecosystem on Solana was just getting off the ground, Solinart was one of the very first to jump into building a secondary marketplace. Why did you start at that point? And since then, the market has evolved a lot. How are you adapting and what's next?
00:01:39.452 - 00:02:12.538, Speaker B: Yeah, so like you said back in, it was June or July. Like, the NFTs on Solana were, like, very scarce. Like, there was basically, like, it was just starting to, like, grow. And basically, I guess we just, like, saw the potential of Solana. Like, we saw, like, the low transaction fees. We saw the very fast transactions. And we were like, well, NFTs are booming on Ethereum.
00:02:12.538 - 00:02:46.208, Speaker B: Why wouldn't they be booming on Solana in the near future? The thing is, we didn't expect it to go that fast. So it all happened so fast. And we were just building, we just found a new playground basically away from Ethereum and the very high transaction fees. And we were like, okay, let's try Solana. It looks cool. And basically, that's how it all started. And then little by little, it started growing and growing and booming.
00:02:46.208 - 00:03:29.612, Speaker B: And then we feel like, I mean, personally, I feel like there was a before and after degenerate ape Academy. That was when NFTs on salon really exploded. And that's when we realized that, okay, we might be onto something. And we kept on building, kept on trying to improve our marketplace. And I guess, like, right now, what's in the future for us is to keep building, keep innovating, try to improve the marketplace day by day. Listen to the criticism that's being made to us and try to listen to it and build on what's being told to us and obviously recruit. We're a small team, as you might know.
00:03:29.612 - 00:03:46.324, Speaker B: It's still four people, but we're getting there recruiting and we're going to keep building because we want to be like one of the leading innovative projects on Solana, basically, along with all these amazing projects that we have today.
00:03:46.784 - 00:04:28.864, Speaker A: Amazing. Awesome. This is a good segue into Zed magic Eden, part of the secondary marketplace ecosystem that has been maturing. You guys are relatively recent entrant, but have been growing incredibly quickly and are now one of the biggest secondary marketplaces on Solana. What was missing in the ecosystem that made you start? And with all the continuing competition entering, how do you think about differentiating yourselves from all the other secondary marketplaces moving forward? And how do you think about competition differentiation in this space, both for yourself and generally for folks thinking about building?
00:04:29.024 - 00:05:08.678, Speaker C: Dude, big questions. So I think a few things, right? Like maybe I can share a bit of the origin story of magic Eden as some context, because I think there's some interesting elements there. So our team comes from very strong consumer product backgrounds. So I used to be a PM at Coinbase. My co founders were at Uber and Facebook, and we were pretty interested to build like a super interesting consumer product in crypto. And we thought that NFT marketplaces was a really good place to do that because of the sheer proliferation and growth in NFTs over the last nine months. And we weren't even necessarily thinking about Solana necessarily.
00:05:08.678 - 00:06:02.674, Speaker C: We were actually just thinking about what should a web3 marketplace truly look like? And we approached it from that first principles layer and felt that a lot of the existing marketplaces that were out there had very much of an eBay style experience of like, it felt very transactional. Right. Whereas in actuality, where we think nfts are going is that it's very much a community and social element to this, as well as a transactional layer. Like in the same way that exchanges for some, like as they proliferated, were, you know, they built the exchange, then they built like a brokerage and they built like, custody and all these other things around it. And I think nfts will be in a very, very similar set of infrastructure build over time. So that's sort of how we got started and why we wanted to build something a little bit different. And we've been around for just under two months, and it's been a pretty insane couple of months.
00:06:02.674 - 00:06:30.144, Speaker C: So to your second question around how I think about differentiation and competition. I think there's going to be obviously very intense competition at that secondary marketplace layer. I think that's pretty clear. And that's true for Ethereum, that's true for Solana. That'll be true for any core secondary marketplace in any industry. For us, when we think about differentiation, there's a few things. One is you can go vertically and tackle things like primary issuance.
00:06:30.144 - 00:07:13.808, Speaker C: That's something we're really interested in. How do you build a set of creator tools that allows creators to come in, get into the ecosystem, mint nfts in a way that doesn't require any coding. So how do you lower the barriers to entry on that front? And then obviously primary issuance then leads directly into the secondary marketplace. So that's the first point, a vertical sort of approach. Then there's a horizontal approach where you can tackle specific categories like games, or specific categories like one of one artwork. And a lot of the marketplaces today have a very generalized marketplace experience. But my expectation going forward is that NFT is going to get really weird in all these different categories.
00:07:13.808 - 00:07:28.004, Speaker C: And whoever has very deep, deep set of standards, deep set of ux experiences, a deep sort of understanding of what the use cases are within these verticals is going to do really well. So I think that's probably the other piece that we're thinking a lot about.
00:07:28.664 - 00:08:12.514, Speaker A: That's great. Ervin is building a game open dive, and Openera is one of the leaders in thinking about gaming on Solana. Gaming on Solana is about to take off and Opendive will be using NFT backed assets in game. Openera is building an AR wallet to allow people to interact with NFTs in physical space. So to Zed's point, marketplaces are gonna have to evolve to support gaming use cases. How do you think NFT marketplaces need to evolve? And how does the NFT ecosystem in general need to evolve to support the sorts of assets that you are going to be building for gaming?
00:08:13.494 - 00:08:59.434, Speaker D: So I think there's three things that need to happen. The first one is that we really need to focus on standards. And so when we think about, for example, interoperability, what does it mean to share assets in the metaverse? Everyone talks about this concept, but currently what happens is interoperability at the business level. So we need to have standards not at the business level, but at the protocol level. So for example, current games, when they decide to share assets across each other, they enter into a business agreement to kind of include these assets into each game. And so this could affect also how marketplaces work. But it's not only just standards at the technology or the protocol level, but also standards in terms of the terminology.
00:08:59.434 - 00:09:40.090, Speaker D: I'm building a game, or we're building a game not just for the D gens, right? Not for the guys who are in their mid twenties or mid thirties, because these guys are not going to grind 1210 hours even more. In reality, it's the young audience. So if I go to my nephew who's six and his cousins and tell them, hey guys, you have to get a wallet, what does that mean? Hey guys, you're going to use gas, what does that mean? So we need to think not only about Web 3.0, but also about Web 2.0. And extending from that, I would say that really the concept of the marketplace is a centralized concept. I love these guys here. But in reality, when we think about bitcoin, back in the days, it was about peer to peer transactions.
00:09:40.090 - 00:10:30.182, Speaker D: So we need to figure out a way to perform peer to peer NFT transactions. So loot box swapping and things like that. And there's other stuff too, really to consider. For example, when you think about educating people, like I mentioned, and let's see. And also like, the last thing that I would say is, you know, current mobile wallets are boring, right? Currently, people focus particularly on how to create these assets or these nfts, but they don't focus on how to consume the actual experience. And so when we're building this wallet, we're really focusing around the experience for nfts, right? And what comes next. And so that really needs to happen, right? How do we consume the media? Not just how we showcase it as a JPeg on a plain wallet in.
00:10:30.198 - 00:11:37.634, Speaker A: Addition to gaming, you know, kind of enabling this kind of boom in nfts. Talk about needing more kind of innovation and the way that we exchange in the deFi space on Solana, we've had a lot of that innovation, but it's maybe a little bit more difficult for the average person to engage with than an NFT transaction. Berndt is creating a lot of innovative auction types for nfts, in addition to other kinds of tooling that will bridge DeFi and the NFT space. Currently, the Defi ecosystem feels a little bit independent of nfts. There's been a lot of talk of things like lending, fractionalization, staking of nfts, things like this. So Bern, if you're awake under those glasses, what are the most promising use cases for entities in Defi? Where are you guys going to play a role. And how is this going to actually take off with the mainstream? My check for burnt.
00:11:38.454 - 00:11:42.314, Speaker D: I can yell, here, go burnt.
00:11:42.734 - 00:11:44.154, Speaker E: Sorry, I gave you the bad one.
00:11:44.774 - 00:11:45.606, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:11:45.790 - 00:12:17.024, Speaker E: So, I mean, I think kind of to first start that off just urban. Thank you. And I think kind of gave me a pretty good t ball on what we're building over here. And I think kind of just starting even before I dive into the question, a lot of this is really kind of dependent on answering what's been happening over the past hundreds of years in the current idea of a marketplace. And of course, Ervin, I didn't pay him, I swear, but he gave me a pretty good t ball on that. You know, marketplaces are a very centralized idea. And really, the way that Barnes started was this aspect of being able to create this completely peer to peer marketplace and decentralized environment.
00:12:17.024 - 00:13:09.852, Speaker E: You know, this has been an industry that has really been. I hate using the word gatekeep, but, you know, gate kept for a very long time where a lot of people, including people like us, really couldn't. I remember we burned a banksy a while ago, sold it on OpenSea, and a lot of the places we couldn't even get onto because I was anonymous and I wasn't famous yet, and kind of after that fact, you realize there's a very big issue not only in crypto, but in the traditional environment, especially in the web two world. And sadly, a lot of what I am seeing is, I like to call it radio on the Internet, where it effectively is just web two with the name of blockchain in mind, with no real deviation onto anything. And so to be able to create a peer to peer, completely decentralized marketplace is something that we've been trying to do for the past five months. And I think when we do take this next step, we truly see NFTs as a trojan horse into the defi industry. I really don't think you had any more retail traction than something that top shot brought in.
00:13:09.852 - 00:13:31.804, Speaker E: I mean, really look at something like Axie Infinity or even all the play to earn games right now. I mean, at the end of the day, you're interacting with the DeFi protocol with a mask. That is a game, and it's enjoyable and it's fun and it brings in a lot of traction. And I think if there is a way that we get to this aspect of truly defi and a truly decentralized future, we see it as NFTs. It is a perfect trojan horse. Reed.
00:13:33.744 - 00:14:30.284, Speaker A: Thanks. Yeah, I mentioned that we have some kind of new entrants to the Solana ecosystem up on stage. And Zed talked about magic eating coming up online two months ago. Solanalysis is a recent winner of the ignition hackathon, so congrats. It's also been an invaluable resource for those of us who need to kind of keep track of of the NFT ecosystem growth. The metrics you're providing around total volume and market cap for nfts has been great to kind of actually measure the growth, which has gone from basically zero in June to over a billion dollars in market value across nfts in the Solana ecosystem as of just a few days ago. You're also now expanding into things like.
00:14:30.284 - 00:14:47.408, Speaker A: Like Launchpad tools, release schedules, things that go beyond metrics. So one question is about your roadmap. Are you going to be adding more analyses and metrics for the community to keep track of, or are you going in the direction of a different sort of product offering?
00:14:47.576 - 00:15:35.680, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, we're trying to build towards this kind of unknown future, and it's interesting listening to people's views here on stage in terms of centralization versus decentralized. Maybe there's going to be a million different marketplaces, maybe there's going to be a handful. It's kind of unclear, I think, at the moment because we're still applying a lot of web two frameworks to web3. For us, where we really wanted to serve a pivotal role in the ecosystem is really being able to give this bird's eye view of what's happening, no matter what. I do think we need to get a little bit further as far as standards and standardization. But look, the role that we've kind of filled early on is really serving as an aggregator. We want to go deeper in the aggregation tools for users.
00:15:35.680 - 00:16:55.966, Speaker F: We think that it's going to get really, really crazy, it's going to be wild, and we need to help users be able to navigate this landscape and this ecosystem. We are continuing to build tools on the user side, including one thing that we did for the hackathon, which is actually how my co founders and I got started with solanalysis, which is actually we wanted to understand what was the value of an NFT. We wanted to be able to predict the value. So we applied anything ranging from neural nets to a regression model to say, like, this is the predicted value of an NFT because you have a different host of user Personas that want to get into nfts, some of which want to be collectors, some of which want to be traders, some just want to be part of a community and you want to empower people to make the right decision, even if the right decision is I want to buy into this community so I can partake in this ecosystem that's forming. So we formed NFT Flex, we called it, in order to enable that. But I also think there's an entire host of applications that can be built on top of that, whether it's collateralization, borrowing and lending against nfts, et cetera, which is really interesting, hearing the burnt stage talk through DeFi. And like for us, like in terms of think, like, I think a lot of people actually on stage are probably really well suited to think, like, to go into Defi and go down the defi track.
00:16:55.966 - 00:17:35.118, Speaker F: And I think what's really appealing to us with nfts, and it's probably really appealing to a lot of people in the room, is this mass adoption of crypto as a whole. And we think it's going to come in the form of nfts, especially, especially in developed countries where, you know, gaming, entertainment, etcetera, is really, really large. To maybe summarize really quickly, we have all the tools that we're trying to build for users, but we also are trying to empower projects as well to help build towards at least what we think that the future might hold. So we did release our launchpad, and we're going to continue to go down the suite of features for projects, whether it's looking more into dao formation and tooling. Yeah, et cetera. I'll leave it at that.
00:17:35.206 - 00:18:15.104, Speaker A: That's great. All of you have shared some of the vision for where your projects are headed, and immediately I hear some commonality around wanting to build better creator tooling. We are kind of thinking about how we enable a more creator driven economy here on stage today. What are some of the missing pieces of tooling in the Solana NFT ecosystem that you all want to build or maybe issue a challenge to the folks in the audience here, what needs to get built to make the NFT ecosystem in Solana the best for creators out there?
00:18:16.084 - 00:18:16.944, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:18:18.324 - 00:19:03.766, Speaker E: Yeah, I think something that was oddly common in a five person panel, but three people brought up standards, and I think that is where we need to start. Before we can really build anything on top of something, we need a very strong foundation. And I know a while ago, I think everyone on this panel absolutely uses the metaplex standard, which is awesome. And then kind of something that we had an idea a while ago was creating the Solana NFT alliance. We have over 40 names on it and really just trying to push this, the idea of standardization, not only just so that we can all have it and have ease of access, but for new people coming onto a platform, new developers, people who want to learn. There's no open zeppelin here right now, especially if we wanted to have something like an open zeppelin on Solana. The idea for this kind of alliance was to do something like that.
00:19:03.766 - 00:19:43.582, Speaker E: And I think especially as we start to think of more standards on ourselves and really submit it to the community, for example, we're currently building a standard that we'll be pushing in the next two weeks of collections on chain, effectively so we can keep track of everything, but something like that, where we can then bring this out to the community, can all communally agree on a standard and kind of work towards this common goal. Well, effectively, all boats are going to be rising together. And I think before we can really solve this situation of what we build on top, we need to figure out the standard solution. And we are in the best place because you're looking at the authors right now, and really, the future is so bright. That's why I have the sunglasses, really.
00:19:43.758 - 00:20:10.846, Speaker D: Yeah, I think to, except for an Bernd's comment, really, that standards do matter. And as I mentioned, I think we need to have standards at the protocol level, not at the business level. And so the metaplex standard is one of them. And this sort of, you know, NFT standard is very different from what we see in EVM compatible chains, where essentially the NFT is deployed to the chain. So anybody can go ahead and extend it or modify it and deploy it to cpu compatible with the traditional NFT.
00:20:10.910 - 00:20:11.590, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:11.782 - 00:20:44.600, Speaker D: But this has an issue, because what happens to royalties, right? If you guys use OpenSea, if you use kind of like wearable, the royalties go away. And so the only way that royalties remain is if marketplaces agree upon that these royalties will stay. It's an EVM. Now, contrary to this, the matterplex standard is on chain, right? It's at the protocol level. So any marketplaces, you know, smart magic Eden, when nfts are traded or sold, the royalties remain there. And so that's huge. So that's one thing I think we got to look into.
00:20:44.600 - 00:20:52.408, Speaker D: And for everyone out there that is looking into nfts or building or deploying anything related to nfts, I think user experience is something that's really missing.
00:20:52.456 - 00:20:52.688, Speaker E: Right.
00:20:52.736 - 00:21:17.364, Speaker D: How to consume the media. But also, you know, I would say to a lot of marketplaces coming up that I think, you know, you don't have to always charge the user to trade nfts, right? I can't imagine, you know, like telling someone in the web 2.0 world, hey, you're going to have to pay a tiny fee every time you do something right. In the ETH world we have this concept of meta transactions where essentially the transactional cost or the gas cost is eaten up by the platform. And so I look forward to that coming to Solana pretty soon.
00:21:18.464 - 00:21:52.326, Speaker A: And I know that there are people here who are working on meta transactions like Taurus and others. Shout out, bring it up in conversations. I'd love to hear more thoughts. Right. What are some of the creator tools that need to exist in these? The ecosystem? We heard about protocol standardization. It's incredibly important, especially for all the builders in the crowd. What are we doing to make it easier for folks who don't code for folks who are artists, who are creators and all sorts of stripes? What do we need to build to make this a really user friendly environment?
00:21:52.470 - 00:22:45.444, Speaker C: Yeah, I can jump in a couple of comments. I think the first thing, there's two users. One is the creator and one is the end user who's looking to explore what nfts are interesting or what communities are interesting. I think on the first one it's like we've had so many projects come and approach us and say, hey, do you guys have any developers that we can leverage utilize or can someone help me get this project up and running? So I think the first thing that's very, very low hanging fruit is if I have a bunch of digital files and some metadata, how can I turn that into something that's like a collection or a drop or something that is a set of nfts. And I think that's sort of what we're generally converging towards around this launchpad idea. We have a launchpad on Magic Eden as well. And I think there's a few different ways to go about this.
00:22:45.444 - 00:23:47.320, Speaker C: On the end user side, I think one of the big ux problems that we've been thinking about is if you're a first time user, landing on like magic Eden or Solanart or one of these marketplaces, there are 500 collections there. Which one is interesting to me? Why would I buy into a thug bird? Why would I buy into a dj and ape? What is it about these communities that is interesting? And there's actually no way to do that within the experience of a traditional marketplace, which is why I think there's some social layer that's really interesting here. You imagine it's something like land on the site. Maybe it's some level of information around what the community is talking about, what they care about. Maybe they're voting on some proposals and it gives you a flavor of what is important and what matters to this community versus landing on this page and then just overwhelmed with what's going on. So I think there's something there. From a UX standpoint, the community interaction and community environment is very fragmented across marketplace.
00:23:47.320 - 00:24:00.088, Speaker C: Discord, Twitter, a bunch of other places. So I think on the end user side, there's a ton more we can do, whether that's in the web app or a mobile app that can help with a lot of that information. Yeah.
00:24:00.216 - 00:24:01.244, Speaker E: Oh, go ahead.
00:24:01.664 - 00:24:02.472, Speaker F: You got it.
00:24:02.568 - 00:24:44.948, Speaker B: All right. Okay. So, yeah, well, obviously there's different types of users. There's the traders, there's the holders, and then you have different backgrounds. You have users that come from different blockchain, you have users who are totally new to crypto. And crypto is different from the regular world because you have all these different blockchains that are developing. And the question is, how do you bore them on Solana, and how do you provide that value that will make them come and produce their art on Solana? I feel that goes through a different set of tools that are coming out as we speak.
00:24:44.948 - 00:25:04.444, Speaker B: So, for example, Soulflare just announced their mobile app. That's extremely important. A lot of our users use a phone. They all do their transaction on phone. So that's one of the things. Most people only use the marketplaces on the phone. So that's one thing.
00:25:04.444 - 00:26:19.712, Speaker B: Making it more accessible to regular users, whether they're already familiar with the blockchain or if they're just like discovering it, making, like Zed said, the user experience better, like providing tools such as being able to mint your nfts without having any large of code. That's one way to go at it with that is like a launchpad. Another is something that other marketplaces do, like minting your nfts directly on the marketplace. That brings other issues, like fakes and all that. So I feel like there's a lot to think about in that aspect. We already have our own ideas on how to approach that and feel like that's an area where creativity is really needed, basically. So how to help creators do that is basically by providing these tools that you can build on the marketplace and help them have a seamless experience, just like they have, for example, on Amazon.
00:26:19.712 - 00:26:26.364, Speaker B: And that's what we've been thinking about for the last month. And that's where we're going to be starting to build.
00:26:26.704 - 00:26:27.524, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:26:27.824 - 00:26:53.124, Speaker F: Yeah. I think that a lot of the utility has been really limited with NFT projects date. Right. I don't want to believe that the utility of all these NFT projects is going to be like buying and selling on the secondary market. I think that there will be, especially in the gaming world, et cetera. There's going to be these really, really fun applications of nfts and what I can do with them. And I think that's where we need people building.
00:26:53.124 - 00:27:17.764, Speaker F: I think that there are a bunch of people working on the launchpad. I'm not going to lie. We ourselves are also working on the launchpad effectively. It's called Moonshot. We'll be launching our first cohort later this month. So we have a couple of different projects. You can check it online, but then it's like, it's also like, hey, what comes after that? Is it really just like, okay, everybody who's joined this community can just trade it back and forth with each other or with new members.
00:27:17.764 - 00:27:50.166, Speaker F: What if everybody who bought into this collection really wants to be part of this collection because of what it can provide? And there's actually really limited secondary trading because there's like, I don't know, something else that people are doing with it. So I think we're going to have to figure out, we need to figure out what is the something else and we'll have to create. There's going to need to be tooling because you're transferring a lot of people that are probably not going to come from the web3 world into web3 because they have a lot of experience doing this in other domains. There's going to have to be tooling to bridge people over into this world.
00:27:50.350 - 00:28:27.840, Speaker A: Good example of that HTML five canvas entity is just, I just saw the first project released on the FTX marketplace recently. This allows for sort of interactivity in the browser with an NFT. It's going to unlock a lot of different use cases from just the sort of profile picture projects that we've seen be successful so far. So we've got about a minute, minute and a half left. Let's do a rapid fire after profile pictures. What are going to be the next interesting use cases for NFTs in the Solana ecosystem? Let's start with Sam and go this way.
00:28:27.992 - 00:29:14.520, Speaker B: So I think that right now there's a wave coming of basically gaming nfts and metaverse and all that. And that's going to be a new challenge for marketplaces to tackle. How do you provide value to these projects so that they'll be able to have their users enjoy their experience and trade their nfts with the particularity of it being a gaming NFT. So for example, we're working with Aurori on that, which is one of the biggest gaming nfts on Solana. And we feel like that's probably going to be it. We're going to shift probably towards utility nfts. So gaming metaverse, probably digital goods.
00:29:14.520 - 00:29:18.648, Speaker B: And that's like what's really exciting to us and that's like what we want.
00:29:18.656 - 00:29:26.392, Speaker F: To see rapid fire, like gaming defi and then a bunch of stuff. I don't know, I would say gaming.
00:29:26.448 - 00:29:35.088, Speaker D: Or nfts in gaming that are not lazy because I don't think that your nfts need to be put to work whenever you're physically there.
00:29:35.216 - 00:29:56.356, Speaker E: So yeah, I mean, personally I kind of think it's going to be a lot of immersion. Right. So to kind of give an example, the next thing that we're burning is sadly, or finally, whatever you stand on that bartages slippers and actually working, hopefully there's a 3d model that we can make or someone who can help us make it, but effectively you all get to feel the shammin pride of wearing bartages slippers afterwards. Yeah.
00:29:56.380 - 00:30:01.544, Speaker D: So come over to the hacker house and be able to try on the slippers in the metaverse after we burn them.
00:30:01.924 - 00:30:16.614, Speaker C: I'll say a couple of things. One is capital markets for nfts, which obviously is very related to games, and then layering of nfts on one another. Could be games, could be anything, but it's just going to get pretty weird. So we're pretty excited about it.
00:30:16.954 - 00:30:20.914, Speaker A: All right, thank you so much, everybody on stage. I think we finished right on time. Thank you for coming.
