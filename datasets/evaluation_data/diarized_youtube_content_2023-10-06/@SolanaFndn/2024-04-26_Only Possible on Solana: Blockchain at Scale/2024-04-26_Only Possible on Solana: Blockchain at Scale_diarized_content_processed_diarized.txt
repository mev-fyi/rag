00:00:00.280 - 00:00:20.910, Speaker A: As the helium network grows, we need the blockchain that's underlying to also grow with it, and Solana is the only real option for something like that. And when we're thinking about not just the coordination, the scalability, but what does that experience look like for the average user? It needs to be intuitive, it needs to be fast, needs to be simple, and Solana truly is the only blockchain that can power those types of interfaces.
00:00:21.102 - 00:00:41.494, Speaker B: Thanks to Solana speed and fees, people don't even realize it looks like a web two product, but it's actually cheaper and faster. We are overtaking traditional systems using blockchain, and we are providing more freedom and more accessibility. BCAF is only possible on Solana because of its great composability and performance.
