00:00:00.200 - 00:00:30.038, Speaker A: On a one giant shared computer where there is no friction between any of these different companies. It's all shared state, and it's all running at the speed of light. That can actually happen. And that's clearly a better system. It's cheaper, it's faster, it's a technology that's an improvement over what's existing today. Even though those existing things are running on centralized servers. Without any of these limitations of decentralization, they've actually built something worse.
00:00:30.038 - 00:00:47.934, Speaker A: And this is why I think crypto will eventually win. It's inevitable, because these systems, because of the constraints we put on ourselves, trying to make it open and transparent and decentralized, actually force us to build something that is dramatically better. That's clearly a win for everyone.
