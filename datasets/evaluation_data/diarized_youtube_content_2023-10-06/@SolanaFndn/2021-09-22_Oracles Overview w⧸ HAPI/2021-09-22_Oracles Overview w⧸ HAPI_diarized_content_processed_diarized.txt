00:00:05.600 - 00:00:33.334, Speaker A: Everybody, welcome to another ignition workshop. Today we're going to be focused on all things oracles. We have the infamous bartos joining from the Solana labs side, and we also have jumbo from happy. They're going to cover all sorts of stuff. As always, drop your questions in the twitch chat, they'll get around to him. But yeah, welcome the both of you, have a great time on the workshop.
00:00:34.714 - 00:00:58.556, Speaker B: Thank you for introduction. I think the, if I may start myself from the basic introduction of what oracles trying to achieve and in general what oracles mean, the current landscape of the cryptocurrency, I think we can start from there. What do you think?
00:00:58.740 - 00:01:09.036, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's good. Maybe before we go, actually, the topic, can you talk about happy and yourself at least? Happy?
00:01:09.100 - 00:01:09.772, Speaker B: What is happy?
00:01:09.828 - 00:01:12.664, Speaker C: Why should I care? How is it relating to Solana?
00:01:14.164 - 00:01:19.504, Speaker B: Okay, great. So basically, plug from the get go. I liked it.
00:01:20.824 - 00:01:21.764, Speaker C: Let's go.
00:01:22.384 - 00:03:13.294, Speaker B: So basically, what happy is, in very short summary of what happy is, is basically a cybersecurity layer. The idea is to provide an entity, regardless of whether it's a liquidity provider or dex, or sex, or centralized exchanges or decentralized exchanges. The idea of HUAP is to unite, basically make the network, cybersecurity network connected with these entities, and basically propagate the data or information on the kind of illicit activity. So let's say you have a centralized exchange that has been hacked, or let's say there has been a siphoning of funds, and you need to inform and notify basically all of the network of the centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges about the unfortunate predicament that has happened. So basically, happy allows for almost instantaneous kind of notification or alerting system that basically tells every sex in this network happy protocol network, or as we call it, ecosystem. And basically it provides the necessary data and information on the potential threat that a certain address can post to the centralized exchanges or even bridges in the case if perpetrator wants to launder his or her pumps. So that's the basic idea.
00:03:13.294 - 00:03:41.382, Speaker B: So if I were to encapsulate it into words, basically hap is to prevent money laundering and alleviate potential losses that can ensue from that. It's a bit of a broad, kind of generalized summary, so feel free to basically ask whatever questions you might have.
00:03:41.518 - 00:03:53.486, Speaker C: Yeah, so maybe, I don't know, I'm kind of simpleton. So let's say, I would imagine you basically flag, like at the simplest case, you flag the wallets that have suspicious funds.
00:03:53.550 - 00:03:54.414, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:03:54.454 - 00:03:56.554, Speaker C: For the exchanges what else?
00:03:57.654 - 00:04:37.378, Speaker B: The idea that this is where oracles come into play. Basically we need data providers, especially in the, basically our first steps, we need data providers. I don't know whether you know, some of the centralized solutions that tackle the illicit addresses and databases on the illicit addresses. Basically solutions like cipher trace. Cipher trace basically is this kind of entity that traces funds in the blockchain. We need their data. They will be our data providers.
00:04:37.378 - 00:05:25.364, Speaker B: We already partnered with the crystal blockchain. Basically they are tackling the same kind of stuff like cypher trades. They are tracing the activity on the blockchain. And since blockchain infrastructure in and of itself is open and kind of transparent, you can basically see where funds are going and where basically turnover of funds in general. So we need their database in basically this kind of first stage because we need time to accrue our own data on the addresses. So that's where oracles kind of happy oracles come from.
00:05:26.424 - 00:05:31.644, Speaker C: Okay, makes sense. On your website you have this big 26 days. What's the significance of that?
00:05:35.644 - 00:05:40.864, Speaker B: If you're mentioning that, basically it's the release of the first iteration.
00:05:41.404 - 00:05:44.104, Speaker C: I see. So in 26 days you will go live.
00:05:44.484 - 00:06:11.676, Speaker B: Yep. And actually anyone will be able to trial our solution since it's basically publicly distributable solution and anyone can use it. So it would be quite exciting times for, I think not to sound pretentious, but exciting times for crypto enthusiasts and us in general.
00:06:11.740 - 00:06:30.240, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. Makes sense. And so that's awesome. So maybe let's talk in general about oracles. What's your view on the, like, where do oracles are heading? I know you're using like Dao in your solution.
00:06:30.392 - 00:07:46.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I see oracles basically as a kind of transformative force that basically changed the idea and concept of how Defi works. So oracles have become the link, the necessary link that connects off chain data and brings it on chain, which before hasn't really been possible at all. And the idea that it also enables kind of the more complex structures like landing, like trace tracking the weather forecasts and in general, IoT things is kind of the main avenue. I see oracles getting there. In general, oracles are great at. So I see oracles as a comprehensive mechanism that enabled basically defy as we know it now. That's basically my view of oracles.
00:07:47.214 - 00:07:54.794, Speaker C: Okay. And with your governance tokens you elect the data providers or.
00:07:55.654 - 00:09:08.424, Speaker B: Yeah, the governance of happy and the oracles. Oracles are being paid in happy tokens, certainly. And the, the idea of governance is in general to implement new functionality and also governance. The idea of governance is crucial in the sense that it allows basically anyone with the small negligible amount of tokens to propose a certain address, let's say a malicious address, potentially malicious address to add to the database that is basically the DAO. And for oracles, we can choose, we, I mean, Dao in general, can choose which oracle provider or will it be our oracle provider, our own oracles, or will it be, let's say, API three, which is also kind of in our, under our purview currently. Yeah, we are looking into API three as our oracle provider.
00:09:08.804 - 00:09:20.264, Speaker C: Okay, that's awesome. Do you have an example how I would integrate your happy oracle on Solana for people that are building during the hackathon?
00:09:23.124 - 00:10:22.934, Speaker B: So how would you implement it? Since our oracle kind of is not a check of all traits, it's basically. Basically, the idea is to get the data from the data provider in the simplest of terms, and it's not really something that is as maybe complex and as versatile as the chainlink proposes. So I think the oracles of Huap is mostly proprietary and they are not the central cog of the machinery in general. But I suppose if anyone wanted to implement happy oracles, it wouldn't be much of an issue. I'm not really a tech guy, and I can't go into the details of how it would happen, but I don't think it would be a problem.
00:10:23.714 - 00:10:49.442, Speaker C: Yeah, it would be awesome to have, at least for the people during the hackathon, since this is a solana ignition specific hackathon to see like how I could flag specific addresses, maybe for people that are listening in it. Maybe an idea for one of the projects could be take a serum Dex and integrate happy to reject the traits that are coming from suspicious addresses.
00:10:49.578 - 00:12:06.874, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly what we are trying to achieve. With Dexs, it's a little bit more complicated, unlike with the centralized exchanges, that you don't need really to add any string of codes additionally. But with the decentralized exchanges, there is a need to integrate smart contracts, which is basically the fundamental idea of happy embedding of these smart contracts. So with Uniswap, it would be a little bit harder since the Ethereum gas fees would basically be a little bit of an issue. But about Solana, I think it's really easy to integrate in Solana blockchain and make it usable. So that's why we're building the basis of our protocol on Solana currently. So it will be Solana first deployed on Solana, then on Ethereum, and then we will basically see.
00:12:07.334 - 00:12:15.474, Speaker C: Nice. And are you using wormhole in any way to move the data between the chains, similar to what fifth is doing or. Not really.
00:12:19.454 - 00:12:51.764, Speaker B: We have built our database initially on the Solana, so we don't really need to move anything. But regarding the transfer of token we used, unfortunately we haven't used wormhole. We used Allbridge for that, because I don't think wormhole was there before. So yeah, we used all bridge. So that's basically it.
00:12:51.804 - 00:13:31.584, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. I don't know if there is a question from the audience about price deviations within the Oracles. There was like a similar event that happened, I think, this week with PIF this or last week. I don't know, I'm losing sense of time. Sorry about that. But basically they had the event where there was large confidence interval for people that don't know how PIV works, it published right now, the spot price, that's aggregated across multiple publishers, and it also provides confidence interval for the price.
00:13:31.584 - 00:14:04.324, Speaker C: And during this event, they misreported a price during a single slot that led to liquidations. The confidence interval was fairly wide. So since you're building an oracle, I know your oracle is primarily focused on security, but what's your take on dealing with price deviations like that and potentially preventing malicious publishers that could benefit from liquidations? Not that it happened in this case, but.
00:14:06.424 - 00:15:38.252, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there is a certain trade off to be made when it comes to basically having oracles that are decentralized and oracles that are more centralized but have more trust put on them. So as you basically enlarge the amount of validators that have to validate the certain data, you basically have this problem that not all validators are really that not all validators can be trusted, basically. So there is a trade off that has to be made whether you want to go basically the route of decentralization or route of consistent data. So when it comes to the. I think P uses confidence value. Yeah, basically it aggregates the median kind of value of from all, from multiple, multiple sources and gets the data point from a data provider. So if you could enlighten me how maybe you know how pith exactly works.
00:15:38.252 - 00:15:47.740, Speaker B: I'm not really that versed in the pith in general, so maybe you can elaborate on that.
00:15:47.932 - 00:16:34.624, Speaker C: Sure. So in general, I think they aggregate data across multiple slots and then see how much it deviated from the previous slot across all the aggregations, and then publish a confidence interval as along the like TWAP and spot price. I can, I guess for all the people that are on the call. Also publish a link to GitHub where PIF is located. Just give me a second. Just trying to make sure that I have. So the link that I just posted is for the examples from the PIF repository.
00:16:34.624 - 00:17:13.674, Speaker C: I need to find an equivalent between for switchboard as well. And there is also PiV client that you can take a look at if someone is interested how they are publishing prices. Let's find a similar one for switchboard. I want to make sure I kind of covered all the oracles and also there's like Chainlink coming to solana as well. I think they're just finishing an OCR implementation for solana as well. This is an example for switchboard.
00:17:15.174 - 00:17:17.302, Speaker B: Yeah, go on.
00:17:17.478 - 00:17:18.754, Speaker C: Yeah, go ahead.
00:17:19.474 - 00:17:45.894, Speaker B: As far as my knowledge goes, I think fifth is more on chain centered than, let's say chainlink is. I think there are not on chain related, but more crypto related market data than chainlink, which is basically everything you want. I might be wrong on that.
00:17:47.194 - 00:19:00.042, Speaker C: Yeah, that's correct. Right now the PIF is focusing primarily on financial data. So one of the points for people that are listening is you can access any sorts of financial data, like equities, FX, crypto, what else? And commodities. Yeah, what am I missing? And this is kind of cool because we can start building very interesting products across multiple asset classes where potentially you could have synthetic products that are allowing you to do like hedging, which is like super interesting. The other thing that I think is unique to PIF from other oracles like Chainlink and switchboard, for financial data at least, is they are getting the data primarily from market makers. So that means you will have access to the data during the same block that the trades is happening versus going.
00:19:00.098 - 00:19:05.054, Speaker B: Through some form of aggregate. So basically latency will be lower than usual.
00:19:05.494 - 00:19:44.664, Speaker C: Yeah, if you need that latency. So sometimes latency is good, sometimes it's bad. During the liquidation event where they misreported the price on a single oracle, that's probably bad. Like in this case, you should definitely use like confidence intervals to ensure you have this like additional dimension of information. It would be also potentially cool to use like TWAP to make sure the price didn't deviate as much. I think compound on Ethereum is doing something like that where they actually don't liquidate people immediately. I think you have an hour, but I might be mistaken.
00:19:48.844 - 00:20:01.304, Speaker B: Yeah, I see that fifth in general operates more supplementary to the other Oracle solutions, or am I wrong with that?
00:20:02.114 - 00:20:42.254, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think that's a good understanding. If I wanted to have a generic oracle that's pulling something like you mentioned, API three or some other data sources, I would probably go with Chainlink or maybe switchboard and focus on getting this custom data on the blockchain. If I'm looking for financial data, I would probably go with pipe. Just because the quality of the data and the trusted aspect of the network I think would be appealing to me versus relying on a bunch of aggregators and maybe exchanges.
00:20:44.754 - 00:21:15.594, Speaker B: What struck me unusual aspect of pith is that in the current ecosystem of cryptocurrency and infrastructure in general, pith doesn't have its token. And I was wondering whether there is basically how do you get revenue from people using your oracle network if you are not monetizing it? Basically, is it publicly available?
00:21:17.054 - 00:21:52.582, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a good question. I don't know if PIF will have a token or not. I think that would be a question to the team. Same. I don't know if switchboard will have a token or not. So in that case I would imagine they are still looking for a specific source of revenue. But another way to look about it from PIP perspective, I think of it more as a collective where all those independent market makers right now, they need to go to exchanges and pay for the data, especially in equities worldwide and like commodities worldwide.
00:21:52.582 - 00:22:05.314, Speaker C: If they all agree to publish it for free on the blockchain, then they kind of like escape the prisoners dilemma where they need to pay to the exchanges for the data that they really produce.
00:22:07.094 - 00:23:15.804, Speaker B: Yeah, because we kind of have the similar problem with happy since the monetization part. Despite the fact that we also have our token. The kind of getting the utility case of the token is contentious point in general in crypto since let's be honest, most projects get their token out before having any substantial fundamental technology behind it. So as for us, happy, basically we see the main use case of the token asset subscription based. So any entity that are using our protocol basically subscribing to and have to hold happy instead of, you know, fiat. So that's the idea. I think Pete kind of might go this route.
00:23:15.804 - 00:23:19.724, Speaker B: I have. I got feeling about that.
00:23:21.104 - 00:23:54.244, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll see, we'll see. Let's see if there's more questions from the audience. But that's interesting. So with happy, what's your monetization? I guess right now? And like if I'm a centralized data publisher of a like cybersecurity information, why would I allow that data to go be published on happy. So you pay happy token to those publishers and they have done, I guess, staking the network or how does it work?
00:23:54.404 - 00:25:11.524, Speaker B: Yeah, the idea that centralized solutions that trace the network, the blockchain infrastructure are kind of confined in this off chain space. So they can't really get into the need, into the, into the on chain. Basically they can get into the on chain side. So we are kind of the pathway for them to get there. And there is a kind of, I think, mutual benefit in there for both parties since they also get kind of a cut from the subscription based model that centralized exchanges will be paying us for using happy. So yes, they are getting their cut and basically I see it as a quid pro quo kind of deal here. So we are helping them to get on the on chainsight and as time goes on, we are also looking into getting rid of the data provider side in general.
00:25:11.524 - 00:25:29.394, Speaker B: Since the main idea of data providers in happy currently is because we don't have enough data, enough database on the addresses at this time, there's basically a temporary solution.
00:25:30.334 - 00:26:19.964, Speaker C: Nice. All right, that's fair enough. What's your view on the explosion, I guess, of nfts and how that relates to the oracles? I know the switchboard guys have been working on getting the floor price of nfts on Solana, but potentially there was a lot of data related to different nfts in the chat. I just posted an example from switchboard how they are tracking a floor price. I think this is probably a digionipes if I read that correctly. So how would you like, what do you think about that? And maybe that's potentially more important for happy. Like how would you track like counterfeit nfts? Like someone took the picture and then minted it as their own, but it's like wrong NFT.
00:26:21.484 - 00:27:11.754, Speaker B: Yeah. The boom of NFT kind of spurred us to also look in the way of how we can get under Ryan. And I see that since NFT is basically the identificator of some sorts, it wouldn't be that much of issue to get happy also to work with the not only addresses, wallet addresses, but also kind of NFT stuff in general. So I'm not that familiar with the oracle and NFT combination, so to speak. So if you could enlighten me in that way.
00:27:12.694 - 00:27:32.458, Speaker C: I don't know. I mean, it feels like it could be a potentially useful product where, you know, maybe you track, like, was this image somehow faked? Especially cross chain? Like, let's say I have an ape from material and someone is trying to mint similar ones.
00:27:32.506 - 00:27:33.730, Speaker B: Oh, I get it.
00:27:33.842 - 00:27:44.214, Speaker C: Yeah. And it's like, hey, this is something different. I don't know how this could be solved, but it would be interesting to maybe fight this cross chain copycats.
00:27:45.974 - 00:28:01.234, Speaker B: So basically preventing forgery in this kind of way. Yeah, that's actually quite exciting. But how do you go about it? I suppose. Andrew up in the air.
00:28:01.894 - 00:28:24.374, Speaker C: Okay, fair enough. What about the audience? Anyone having more questions about oracles that we should cover? Maybe happy, do you have like a demo of the product? Like how someone integrated already with happy?
00:28:24.714 - 00:29:02.678, Speaker B: Yeah, that would be good to see. We have. I'm not sure whether I can breach NDA right now, but basically we have a couple of centralized exchanges that will use happy right after the MVP release. Minimum viable product, which is set to happen in the October 18. Yeah, so it will be. I can't really name the exchange itself, but it will be top six exchange. Yeah, I can give a hint, but.
00:29:02.678 - 00:29:59.814, Speaker B: But I can't really name the exchange itself, so apologies for that. Also actively looking for decentralized exchange that will be using happy. And I can say with 90% of certainty that we have found it already and we are quite happy. Sorry for the pun. We are quite happy with the current advancement in this regard. Decentralized exchange, as I already mentioned, and integrating happy and embedding smart contracts in the decentralized exchange are fraught with the kind of issues in and of itself. Since you need to pay more gas fees if you are talking about Ethereum, but you can circumvent that if you are using Solana.
00:29:59.814 - 00:30:11.134, Speaker B: That's kind of a hint that I can give about decentralized exchange and integration right after the MVP.
00:30:11.514 - 00:30:16.254, Speaker C: So no demo. When should we expect a demo? A month.
00:30:18.354 - 00:30:57.534, Speaker B: Demo? We have already a private demo, but the public one and the essentially a product itself will be available. As you have mentioned on the website, there is a countdown and that's basically when it it will happen. We are currently also working with the near platform near blockchain. They are also quite interested and excited about happy. Yeah, I think the future looks bright for us. Sounds a bit pretentious, but still.
00:30:59.684 - 00:31:09.384, Speaker C: Nice. All right, I don't know what else do you think we should talk about in terms of oracles?
00:31:12.684 - 00:31:44.824, Speaker B: I wanted to ask about the p kind of decentralized aspect of P and how does PIF in general tackles decentralization, as far as I know, when I was reading about PiP, I haven't really noticed the kind of notes and validation in general about this sort of stuff. Maybe my research was not complete so I would.
00:31:48.684 - 00:32:08.164, Speaker C: You can think of it as a collective of multiple data providers where I think they vote who next can join the network? And it's like effectively a private publisher network of prices that you can trust. So it's not like fully decentralized.
00:32:09.704 - 00:32:36.474, Speaker B: Okay. I think the idea of oracle decentralization is in itself kind of an oxymoron to some extent since making oracles decentralized is a bit, I think, out of scope currently for tech blockchain tech overall. Correct me if I'm wrong here.
00:32:37.734 - 00:33:00.654, Speaker C: No, I think it's fair. I mean especially with, with prices like financial data. I think it would be harder to be more like if you, if you are able to get all the market makers to subscribe to this network or like major market makers to subscribe to like PIV network. I would call it decentralized.
00:33:02.434 - 00:33:09.794, Speaker B: So would you call a network decentralized if, let's say because they create the prices, right?
00:33:09.834 - 00:33:14.934, Speaker C: Like ultimately, yeah. Like if you trade for them, right, they create the prices.
00:33:15.674 - 00:33:26.694, Speaker B: Yeah. So the aggregation of price data from multiple sources can be called decentralization or not.
00:33:28.674 - 00:34:04.364, Speaker C: In case of PIF. I think so. It's better than just like going through some aggregators that get data you don't necessarily know how. Like in this case it's like directly from the source, from the market makers. And if you have enough of them and they own like or at least trade enough like big enough portion of the market, then they wouldn't have necessarily incentives to collectively cheat on you. That's weak view on the decentralization.
00:34:04.704 - 00:34:35.868, Speaker B: Yeah. I've seen kind of chain link tackling this issue with the reputation system that they have. They have a lot of notes and basically how they gauge that this or that note is trustworthy. They have a reputational system for that. Whether pith has something alike or is that not currently in the scope?
00:34:36.016 - 00:35:03.636, Speaker C: Not that I know of. So I don't think so, no. They don't have a reputation system for the publishers. What else would be interesting that people could build on top of PIV for the hackathon? I don't know if like anyone in the audience is actually building something right now on top of PIV for the current hackathon, but if you are, it would be interesting to hear.
00:35:03.740 - 00:36:09.424, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the idea of future trading and options trading kind of spark have been, have long been kind of the idea to make it more like a decentralized exchange, but still with the order book model, that kind of hard to pull off. And I think that Oracle's play a great deal in making the experience seamless and smooth, especially on the Solana. On Ethereum, options trading platforms and futures is kind of a big no since gas fees. And in general, it's kind of not really that usable when it comes to processing many transactions. So I think on Solana it would be great to have something like, I think we have psychic options or something like that built in Solana.
00:36:09.464 - 00:36:55.114, Speaker C: Yeah, there's few site options. Yeah, there's few options platform that are building. So zeta markets are building binary options, Psi options I think are building american style options. And then also hero network is building options and permutual markets. So for hero, let me put some other links for Psi options. And they are all fairly interesting in terms of derivatives product and they approach it differently. So the Psi options and then there is also for people I guess, that are watching the chat, I just want to make sure that I'm publishing all the right links and nobody is kind of left out.
00:36:55.114 - 00:37:08.874, Speaker C: So those are definitely interesting platforms. I think out of those, Zeta and hero are using PIV, as far as I know, and not sure about psyoption, what they are using.
00:37:11.574 - 00:38:08.194, Speaker B: Yes. So I see the idea of derivative platform in general is quite budding currently. And if you are too get to get a hold of the Solana and get it, and get the integrated derivative platform integrated on Solana and get to use and leverage the Solana kind of throughput and the speeds of Solana, I think it can work out quite great in the Solana environment, so to speak. Especially as I mentioned, the kind of hurdles around the making derivative platform in general, especially decentralized one. So I'm excited about these kind of prospects.
00:38:09.454 - 00:38:31.714, Speaker C: Yeah, some of those platforms you can already try. So I think both Zeta markets and PSi options, you can go and try them and your network is still working on it. Definitely. Interesting. Okay. There was this question about like mango Psi options potential exploits you can discuss. So like mango is using like PIF oracles, as far as I know, for like liquidations.
00:38:31.714 - 00:39:13.134, Speaker C: So you know, there's, there's tolerantly an attack, right, where all the publishers potentially could collude and publish something to like liquidate specific market. I think that would be the primary expo that exists right now. But I'm sure like mangu guys are thinking about it. I don't know if like pulling the data from multiple, like if you, if you take a look at the PIP, I don't know if pulling the data from multiple like oracles, like let's say chain link and switchboard would change that much since PIF technically is getting the data from the source around.
00:39:15.154 - 00:40:07.174, Speaker B: Actually, I'm quite fond of the approach that AP three has taken. Instead of getting their marketplace, Oracle marketplace almost, they kind of got straight to the providers of data and cut the intermediary themselves basically. And they have quite a lot of data providers already partnered with quite a lot of data providers. So I think their approach at getting straight to the data provider is quite also interesting to observe. I would like to see something alike on the Solana and I don't think, I'm not sure whether you guys.
00:40:09.114 - 00:40:09.546, Speaker C: Have.
00:40:09.610 - 00:40:16.454, Speaker B: Partnered or are looking to partner with AP three and their kind of take on the oracles.
00:40:18.994 - 00:41:20.154, Speaker C: Not that I know of right now, but it would be great, I guess. So if anyone from API three, I guess, is listening, it would be cool to work to actually have that on Solana. I think the product is actually covering a very interesting space for the oracles to think of it as more like bring the generic data in form of an API to the blockchain. In terms of the outage that was caused, I think there's a question, I guess, on the chat. I don't know if you're looking at the PIV outage. So that was misreported price during a single slot caused by, I think two publishers publishing incorrect data and I think they are looking to improve their confidence interval aggregation, as far as I know. But I would wait for the detailed publish from PIF itself, how they are going to fix it.
00:41:21.374 - 00:41:38.584, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in this aspect, the more kind of median value you, the more value and data you gather and accrue, the better, since you get the better idea of the average.
00:41:39.124 - 00:42:17.994, Speaker C: Yeah. During that specific event, for anyone like kind of interested, I think the price was like reported between five and eight, if I remember correctly, for bitcoin. But the confidence interval was like 21. So the confidence interval was like multiple of the price. And I think at that point you should kind of consider like the confidence interval is so wide that there is definitely something wrong going on and you shouldn't take necessarily actions that are very adverse. Like, the confidence interval is there for a reason and you should definitely use it. It was designed for situations like that.
00:42:19.574 - 00:42:26.714, Speaker B: Yeah. It would be quite interesting to see the full kind of report on what happened there.
00:42:30.734 - 00:42:41.674, Speaker C: We have been going almost for an hour. Looks like there's not a lot of questions in the chat. So I guess we are just boring or people don't care about oracles that much.
00:42:44.614 - 00:43:20.624, Speaker B: I mean, it's quite understandable why it's kind of not the topic people looking for, especially in the market where people kind of saturate the market with the token prices speculations more than actual tech. I mean, that's understandable, especially with the value of bitcoin kind of dropping in the last couple of days. I think people in general not that excited about crypto right now, to be honest.
00:43:21.014 - 00:43:35.310, Speaker C: I'm excited. Anyway, if you have more questions, don't hesitate to go on Twitter and ask. I'm fully active there. I think that happy is active too. So you can always yeah.
00:43:35.342 - 00:43:46.474, Speaker B: If any questions arise. So no issue will answer any question that you guys supply us with. No problem here.
00:43:47.624 - 00:43:51.496, Speaker C: Thanks for listening. Thanks for coming to Solana Hackathon.
00:43:51.560 - 00:43:57.164, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for invite. Yeah, thanks to Aleftina for inviting us.
00:43:57.824 - 00:44:13.052, Speaker C: Yeah, it's awesome. And I look forward to like, public demo where I can see how it's working and hopefully someone from the hackathon can integrate as well. Yeah, I think it's a great use case, especially for decentralized exchanges on Solana. Thanks a lot.
00:44:13.228 - 00:44:13.812, Speaker B: Thanks a lot.
00:44:13.828 - 00:44:14.124, Speaker C: Thanks everyone.
