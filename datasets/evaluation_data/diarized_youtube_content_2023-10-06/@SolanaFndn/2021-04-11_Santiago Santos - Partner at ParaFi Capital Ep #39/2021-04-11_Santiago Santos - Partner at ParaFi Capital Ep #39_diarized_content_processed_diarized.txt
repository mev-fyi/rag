00:00:00.280 - 00:00:02.294, Speaker A: Nothing in this episode is financial advice. Yes.
00:00:02.334 - 00:00:06.234, Speaker B: None of this views are paraphies. They're my own. So do your own research.
00:00:14.494 - 00:00:22.734, Speaker A: Hey, folks, this is Anatoly and you're listening to the Solana podcast. And today I have Santiago from verify with me as a guest. Awesome to have you.
00:00:22.774 - 00:00:24.542, Speaker B: Hey, Tolly. It's great to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:00:24.598 - 00:00:32.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd love to kind of hear your story, how you got into crypto and, like, what, what terrify as a fund is all about.
00:00:32.212 - 00:00:58.324, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So I got interested in crypto in 2012. I was at JPMorgan at the time, and I read the headline magical Internet money. And it was hard to overlook, really, for me. I studied game theory, and as I was reading the Nakamoto consensus, it became, I just said, like, holy shit, this is a new chapter in game theory. You just solved what could be the Byzantium Seattle problem. And that can just allow you to reach consensus without trusting a counterparty.
00:00:58.324 - 00:01:42.990, Speaker B: And it coincided with, like, me doing all these deals at JP Morgan and seeing how, like, the bane of my existence was, like, digging through not very transparent information and seeing, like, how a simple wire transfer after months of work could totally derail, like, a $10 billion acquisition. And it was just, like, somewhat frustrating, like, juxtaposing what I was seeing in bitcoin and what I was seeing at JPMorgan, which was a lot of friction. And I said, well, if this has a remote possibility of working, then there's something interesting. And so over the years, like, I've, after JPMorgan, I was at a Sage View capital, which is a growth equity fund. We were investing in open source software and fintech. And that's where Ethereum got off the ground. And I didn't candidly know if Ethereum is going to be like, powering defi.
00:01:42.990 - 00:02:12.400, Speaker B: I like fintech. I think it's one of the areas where the Internet finance hasn't caught up to the Internet. This is sort of the idea that I keep coming back to. But open source communities do really interesting things, and Ethereum and certainly Solana and some communities are really powerful, and the compounding effects of that become really interesting. But of course, like, traditional funds will never touch crypto. They still are in this state of the world where they're not touching it. And so at some point, much like you probably just realized, I need to do this full time because, a, the space moves so quickly.
00:02:12.400 - 00:02:24.560, Speaker B: And so the parafobit was started in 2018 with this singular focus of we think that, or I think that DeFi is a killer use case and it's going to be really transforming the rails of finance.
00:02:24.632 - 00:03:11.230, Speaker A: That's really cool. The parallel with me was that I kind of loved open source software. This was me as like a nineties kid learning computer science and seeing like Linux being built and then the whole thing with SEO like lawsuit against like the bad guys coming in to try to take it away. But there was no way to like make an investable business out of it. Like outside of like a couple really weird examples like Red Hat, which was just there super early. And then, you know, MongoDB maybe is like another one. But I always felt that like trying to give your code away for free and then trying to like twist the arm of somebody's arm backwards to pay your license deal for like support was like always such a bad, like bad environment.
00:03:11.230 - 00:03:29.364, Speaker A: Like it felt like kind of like scammy but like crypto, right? Despite all the scams happening, I think it's like a more honest way to build open source software. Here's a community, here's a token that means something for that community, right? And being part of it, owning that token is a part of that community and part of the development process.
00:03:29.704 - 00:03:30.648, Speaker B: You're totally right.
00:03:30.736 - 00:03:32.376, Speaker A: It just seems way more transparent.
00:03:32.440 - 00:03:56.564, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I remember because we were investing in open source software at Sage view and so many vc's like missed the boat because like how do you monetize something that is inherently free or forkable or copied by anyone? And then red hat came along, right? And then IBM, I think it was IBM that acquired it and everyone was like, oh wow. And then Mongo. And so we were investing in open source. And to your point, I always felt open source is very powerful. But you know, look at Linux. Very few people actually. You didn't monetize Linux.
00:03:56.564 - 00:04:08.204, Speaker B: Like not a lot of people like, but really this crypto is open source on steroids because it solves a lot of the issues of monetizing and sustaining open source communities. So yeah, I totally agree with what you said.
00:04:08.284 - 00:04:45.772, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an advantage to be open source. We have to give our software away. We have to grow our ecosystem, our knowledge base. Every engineering brain that understands Solana is value added to the network. That's the crazy part. You guys typically don't invest at the infra layer, which I thought was interesting. And recently I was talking to Andre at one of the clubhouses, I think that was hosted by you where he said that he doesn't consider, he considers himself like a layer three developer that he doesn't even worry about protocols.
00:04:45.772 - 00:05:08.156, Speaker A: He puts stuff together into something that's consumer facing. Do you guys see that? Like, like, in my mind, I kind of agree with both of your thesis is that value creation actually occurs at that, like last mile where you actually get to talk to people, right. That's like, figure out their problems. What, what is your, like, thesis behind this? And like, why did you guys make that choice?
00:05:08.220 - 00:05:46.506, Speaker B: Well, I mean, at a personal level, I'll tell you, I think that value will accrue at different parts of the stack. I think we're early that we just don't know. But essentially, I guess in the traditional webtoon world, you have all the layers of the Internet, HTTPs, none of that accrued value. And then you had this very tiny sliver of the user aggregation layer, that accrued value. This is Facebook, Snapchat, Google, Netflix, Salesforce. But I think with tokens, you expand that and you say, well, you actually can capture value across multiple layers of the stack. The question then becomes, on a relative basis, where does value accrue the most? But that's not to say the value can't accrue at layer ones.
00:05:46.506 - 00:06:25.574, Speaker B: I mean, I think you have some very strong proof points that that's the case, like with Ethereum, with Solana, with bitcoin. And look, I guess none of this is investment advice, right? Just full of disclosure, but because we're going to start talking about these things. But generally speaking, like, I do think that like, value can accrue. It really depends on the case by case of what is the monetary policy, what is the token structure of these networks. And I'm convinced that like, there could be really good products that have a terrible token structure and just don't accrue value. And that can be true for a layer one, it could be true for a layer three, it could be true for a L2. So it really kind of, I think, requires you to look deeply into the actual monetary policy token structure of these networks.
00:06:25.574 - 00:06:48.374, Speaker B: But, you know, as it relates to, like the second part of your question, it's just our background. Like, my background's in finance. Like, I gravitate towards defi. And so, you know, I don't pretend to do like everything. I guess there are certain folks in the space that just approaches as a generalized way of investing, and that could work well. We just like to be more narrow in the things that we understand. We think we understand better, or I think I understand it.
00:06:48.454 - 00:07:43.782, Speaker A: Got it. Like, so I, you know, to backtrack a little bit, I think the value does accrue at the infra layer, but it's more like, you know, when you're talking about Internet and protocols, Cisco is a $200 billion company, right? Like, and, you know, they're able to get value out of Internet protocol level. And Microsoft is like, you know, trillion dollar operating systems company. And to me, it always seemed like the lower layers are less risky and get commoditized, but also really hard to compete with because the technology quickly becomes less general, like less mathematical and more engineered. You know, to build, like, a 5g modem that gets competitive with Qualcomm, you don't just need to understand radio. You have to have, like, 10,000 people have, like, micro optimized every nuance of it. Right? Like, which is a ton of work.
00:07:43.782 - 00:07:44.390, Speaker A: Right?
00:07:44.542 - 00:08:05.756, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. Look, from, from my perspective, we just talked about this before, though, we started this, but, you know, I was part of the Solana hackathon. And to me, that was really interesting because it forced me to follow the developers and seeing the quality of developers hearing from them. Look, the tooling has been much improved. There's every incremental protocol that joins this network is enhancing. Right. You have.
00:08:05.756 - 00:08:41.972, Speaker B: And so as more of these hackathons continue, then I think it just becomes like, it really kickstarts this flywheel of this network in a very interesting way. Right? And look, you saw it in ethereum. Like, you know, people tend to forget this, but ethereum for a long time struggled with product market fit. You're trying to boil the ocean. Like, I understand that it's a general consensus, but what do you do with that? Bitcoin is very singularly focused on one particular thing, and it doesn't pretend to do other. I mean, you know what I mean? Like, bitcoin serves a very clear purpose. And ethereum in the absence of maker, for instance, like, you really needed to have that core backbone to say, okay, I have a stable coin, and then I can build all the different money legos.
00:08:41.972 - 00:09:07.268, Speaker B: And so for me, it's interesting because, look, I definitely agree with you that, like, the, you know, and by the way, TBD on the value accrual for ETH in the absence of EIP 1559, because you can have a network that, that has a ton of demand, but does that value accrue to the token unclear. Right? And so, you know, these are the things that we think about a lot. I mean, I think it's quite early still. There's a lot of experimentation at the layer ones, but we're looking at all of them, I guess, yeah.
00:09:07.396 - 00:09:32.938, Speaker A: Do you think like yeah, what is the universal computer for? Right. This is like a really kind of abstract question and like when people tell these for everything, it's really hard to reason with that. Do you think that the finance applications right now are almost like the search engines of the nineties where it's obvious that these are like the things with product market fit. Like these are going to be sticky no matter what happens in the future?
00:09:33.106 - 00:10:14.024, Speaker B: Oh yeah. I mean it's a great question because I don't know if this is SGS or Google or AOL or Facebook or like MySpace, but where I take stock is there's a lot of usage which is very different than 2017. Like there are a lot of folks and the use cases that you're serving these users is strong. Right. And you're seeing it on chain like you can verify the traction, you can verify the level of activity. And in many cases like it's been remarkable to see the growth of stable coin issuance, for instance, or a number of developers entering the space. And so to me that's most interesting of what's going on in these networks.
00:10:14.024 - 00:11:04.758, Speaker B: But yeah, it's unclear I guess from a where are we in? Is this like 1970s, 1980s, 1990s? Two thousands? I don't know if you have view. It feels like we're very early. It feels, it still feels very early because there's a lot of like excitement and experimentation, but there's not, there's not enough standards. I think there's a lot of design space and opportunities interesting how different l one s will connect and value will, you know, trans, be transported between these protocols. I've heard you say before which I think it's a very interesting kind of observation which is, you know, when you do like I guess there's two ways of innovating, right. One is like a step function improvement. And I think like if you're an existing protocol like you sort of like make improvements and you go but then it could take another protocol to do like a step function improvement which really rattles in many ways like what exists.
00:11:04.758 - 00:11:27.004, Speaker B: And I guess if you look back on the Internet there were instances where you had this sort of leapfrog improvement and it just transformed a lot of the things that were going on, like software as a service versus the license model. Like that was like a breakthrough that. And so, yeah, anyways, I've heard you say that. I think it's a really interesting observation and something that I always think about because I'm not prepared to tell you if we found like the killer, that the best model, the best design behind.
00:11:27.084 - 00:11:49.244, Speaker A: Every step function is like, you know, five years of people grinding at that. That was like so obvious to me during the feature phone to smartphones, which it literally happened in one year. But, you know, my team, like building Brew, we were grinding at that for like five years. And then Apple just kind of dropped this magical device.
00:11:49.864 - 00:12:28.574, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fascinating, right? Because when the iPad came out, I was like, I don't know if I need this. This feels like a bigger smartphone. And then, yeah, it just transformed my consumer behavior in a very meaningful way. You know, Nokia sort of missed the boat on smartphones. Google, sorry, Microsoft missed the boat as well on smartphones. And so this is a very both interesting and challenging problem of open source, which is the compounding rate of innovation is much, much faster because everything is open source. And so everyone's sort of improving and forking and looking with the Internet, like the dissemination of information, I think that the innovators dilemma is much, much can pronounce itself like, faster.
00:12:28.574 - 00:13:00.284, Speaker B: Whereas the turnover of the S and P 500 last 100 years has been radical. No one imagined 2030 years ago that most of the competition of the S and P would have been technology companies. No, very few people believe that. The question today is, hey, do you envision a world where most of the activity in the traditional web two world is going to move over to blockchains and if so, where we're still in that phase where most people don't believe it? I think the crazy ones in a very small space of this world believe it, but it's going to take time to do that, I think.
00:13:00.444 - 00:13:42.376, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you. I think what is we're lacking still is founders that are more product centric, less chain centric. And there's a couple of those, like reneal from audience is like my favorite example of this. He doesn't care about the layer one. Like, he will use whichever one he won't like will serve as his like, product vision better. And he's got the singular thing about music that he believes in that's bigger than like anything else to him. There's very few of those folks that are like that, that have that much conviction and care less about, like ETH one or Ethereum versus Solana.
00:13:42.376 - 00:13:44.568, Speaker A: Right. It's more about like getting that thing done.
00:13:44.736 - 00:14:18.754, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny because like, you know, I'm convinced, like, very few people understand how the Internet works. Very few people can draw a bicycle and tell you exactly how the components work, but they all use it, you know what I mean? And so, like, you're right. I mean, ultimately, I think good product wins. You look at the VHS versus Betamax conundrum, right? One was a better technology, the other ones is better marketed. I believe that, like, good technology with good product mindset always will win. But at the same time, like, consumers don't necessarily care. Will they really appreciate decentralization and censorship resistance and minimize counterparty risk? Probably not.
00:14:18.754 - 00:15:01.212, Speaker B: Like at scale, probably a very small subset will care. But I'll tell you what they will care about is like, hey, can I earn 8% of my savings when you're traditional bank like JPMorgan? And I was like, thank JPMorgan, because that's where I work. Gives you effectively negative real interest rates. And I think we're very close to that tipping point where you already see circle offering this rates blockfi's of the world like venture. And hey, you can actually earn an order of magnitude on your savings. Crypto has always been a retail phenomenon, I think, up until now, and that's fine. I think ultimately the reason why the large institutions like BlackRock and JPMorgan have come around to offering, even like bank of America, I think, or Morgan Stanley are now offering direct exposure to crypto investment products to their customers.
00:15:01.212 - 00:15:45.840, Speaker B: I don't think it was someone in their risk committee that woke up one day or their board meeting that said, hey, guys, we need to do bitcoin. I think if we don't do this, we will lose our customers. And that's super powerful, I think, because retail would really push that agenda and really make, I think institutions come around to the opportunity, at least in Defi, and offering financial products that, you know, provide more value. Right. And I think to your point, like, I think good technology gets adopted if it fulfills like three core properties of, like, it's faster, it's better and cheaper. It's sort of a ten x improvement, because most people are very, very resistant when it comes to money. Like the stickiness, like how many people actually change their bank account, the retention of these, like, once you open your bank account, when you're 14 or 15, your parents open your bank account, Wells Fargo, you're probably going to be a Wells Fargo customer for life.
00:15:45.840 - 00:15:55.326, Speaker B: Yeah, unless, unless there's a material shakeout. But I do think that in this macro backdrop of record low rates, DeFi becomes extremely interesting for people.
00:15:55.390 - 00:15:55.798, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:55.886 - 00:16:05.830, Speaker B: And where that actually goes, which protocol is it? Ethereum? Solana? Polkadot? Cosmos? Folks might not even care. And there's a version of this world where it gets routed to the most efficient place.
00:16:05.902 - 00:16:38.082, Speaker A: Yeah, I think if we're the infra level folks, we don't get to talk to the consumer. So I think that story will play out similar to, like, infraverywhere eventually it becomes commoditized. But the best, you still have a ton of competition there. TSMC versus intel is a pretty obvious competitive story there. Do you see the interest rate savings application as a breakout app that could actually go mainstream?
00:16:38.178 - 00:16:59.996, Speaker B: Yeah. Are rates sustainable? You know, like 10,000% APIs? Absolutely not. Right. Will they continue to persist to a level that is sufficiently interesting based on the level of risk that one is taking? Yes, I think so. You know, you don't necessarily need to have 20% AP wise, 50% AP wise. You need to have four or five. And I think the flow would be something like as follows.
00:16:59.996 - 00:17:40.624, Speaker B: Right? You're in your bank account, click of a button, you lock your savings for three or six months. That allows the bank on the back end to either ping someone like Genesis or some, like, crypto native, or have their own desk, go on chain deposit in a money market protocol, earn some interest, and then maybe as part of that entire flow, wrap it with insurance like Nexus. And then it's like, FDIC insured. We're mimicking, like, for the uninitiated in the US, like, FDIC just means, like, you're protected up to a certain amount in your principal. And so I think that flow resonates with me where it's possible. I think circle is already offering customers eight and a half to 10%, depending on, like, how much time they're willing to lock their cash for. Three or six months.
00:17:40.674 - 00:17:41.140, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:41.252 - 00:17:51.652, Speaker B: Along with stable coins. I think these two are like the Trojan horse of this industry, you know? Like, I guess the Internet really took off and you probably know this better than me. Like, with email, I think email made the Internet.
00:17:51.748 - 00:17:52.140, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:52.212 - 00:18:37.968, Speaker B: You know what I mean? Like, it was like the thing that justified, like, having a computer at home and then justified capex and cellular towers to have flip phones and then smartphones and, you know, but it required email because pre email, everyone's like, yeah, it's fun. You know, there's pictures of cats in the Internet. I guess we now have cryptocats. And so it's an interesting parallel or corgis or some of these pixelated art, but stablecoins and also at this interesting intersection of COVID where digitization becomes much more important. And you saw it in Asia for the last 15 years, Asia totally has leapfrogged the US and western countries. As it relates to the fintech experience. The relationship folks in Korea and Japan, particularly, like China, Vietnam, Indonesia, is much, much different than in the US.
00:18:37.968 - 00:19:11.978, Speaker B: You know what I mean? Like people don't have any semblance of what a retail branch is. They use everything, is like vertically integrated in one app. They do everything. And you look at that and you say you're left wondering, well, we're going in that direction. The problem is most people in the US, and this is not critical, but they don't appreciate how broken finance is. The minute you start doing it internationally, the minute you start crossing borders. This is why London is a fintech hub, because by default you needed to build products that can like address some of these challenges, that this financial system at a global level is a patchwork of stuff that doesn't communicate very well.
00:19:11.978 - 00:19:47.556, Speaker B: But defi, is that right? And so naturally, I think, yeah, more and more people are certainly younger generations are much, much more inclined and will be to think of once you get a stable coin, whether it be Libra's diem or a central bank, digital currency or the digital dollar, or just like something like dai, it opens your imagination on, what else can I do with this? Because people hate sitting on cash. And so once you do that, you're like, okay, I can invest. I want to invest, I want to lend, I want to earn interest, I want to do a million things. And so I think that's where I think it will stable coins are really, I think the email moment of this industry.
00:19:47.660 - 00:20:10.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the frightening thing is the global scale of it is that you can rapidly like get absurd amounts of, I mean, to me, 5 billion TVL and Aave is absurd, but I'm sure to JP Morgan they're like, should we be paying attention to this yet? But there's no reason why they can't go to 500.
00:20:10.762 - 00:20:34.994, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I would characterize DeFi last year as a very early beta experiment, trial run of what could happen. And I think we're still in that beta phase. There's still a lot of risks, there's still a lot of hacks, and there needs to be better rigidity, Lindy standards. But yeah, Defi is a speck in the dust that no one has seen. No one. Now, of course, you have like 50 billion of TVL in the aggregate, at least in Ethereum alone.
00:20:34.994 - 00:21:09.326, Speaker B: You start tech on Solana and it becomes interesting as soon as you hit 10 billion, 50 billion. Some banks are getting, it's like, okay, maybe there's something here for us to do. But my estimation is, like, banks probably are the most incentivized to adopt this because they're. They're hurting from. The only departments that keep growing in banks is back office compliance, administrative functions, which, if you think about it, are very much simplified through blockchain. Like, you know, like these things. Like, you can have a very clean record.
00:21:09.326 - 00:21:38.716, Speaker B: There's no real reason why you wouldn't be able to underwrite a mortgage on chain if you're them, right? In a KYC pool of liquidity, you know, your counterparty, you know who's borrowing, you know, the providence of funds. It's all very transparent. And I guess going back to why technology gets adopted, there will come a time you certainly have, I think, the pressure from customers to say, hey, guys, we want to buy bitcoin. We want to invest in crypto. Offer me this product, or I'll go elsewhere. So that's one competitive pressure. Not to get too much port or five forces here.
00:21:38.716 - 00:22:20.652, Speaker B: But the other one is whenever a technology focuses on eliminating fat, eliminating a cost driver, and optimizing that because their margin is declining. And when you have something like this, that can give them an order magnitude ability to underwrite more mortgages on chain, you know what I mean? That frees up so much more capacity, then it's just like a double whammy. And I totally agree with you. I'll say it again, I think Defi, to your point, around just core backbone, I think Defi will become the operating standard in finance for a lot of these functions. Whether the consumer understands how their mortgage is being underwritten, maybe not for them. It just might be like, I get an answer in minutes. I can compare my rate.
00:22:20.652 - 00:22:33.268, Speaker B: I don't need to necessarily provide all this information over and over again, and the rate's more competitive. And on the back end for JPMorgan or Wells Fargo, they might just be able to underwrite order magnitude more mortgages on chain.
00:22:33.356 - 00:22:55.724, Speaker A: Well, do you think there could be a world where we don't have those at all? Like, there is, like, me as a human, directly getting a mortgage from a million people, and Chicago market makers borrowing from that pool and trading directly, right? Like, all in one state machine and one universal computer.
00:22:58.104 - 00:24:06.234, Speaker B: I guess, like, thinking probabilistically maybe, you know, well, essentially, that's what a liquidity provider and something like sushi or uni is doing, right? You allow someone, anyone, to be a market maker and earn fees on their capital base. So I do certainly think that some like flash loans for instance, is allowing someone to do arbitrage opportunities without requiring a massive balance sheet. I mean that's just like as meritocratic as it gets, right? You don't need to have an ISta license. You don't need to have like these arbitrary like things that only large players would be able to do. Now the smartest guys in the room might be anonymous frogs on Twitter that just are really smart or really good developers and just understand how these things work. On another spectrum, I always think that user aggregators will have a place in this industry because they abstract the way the complexity for people, they provide value added services in the same way that open source monetize, mongo or red hat. Providing value added services is the way that you monetize open source is aave or compound or some of these protocols.
00:24:06.234 - 00:24:25.824, Speaker B: The next jpMorgan, maybe. Maybe. Will some banks really take a hit? Yes, I think so. I think people, banks will incrementally resist this new technology and new way of operating will be left behind. They always do.
00:24:25.944 - 00:24:49.372, Speaker A: Do you fear like backlash from regulators that this is going to move too fast for them? Like this world is like it's going to be hard to do KYC on 5 billion people, right? Or seven, you know, a billion people participating in something like this if there's no middleman, right. This is where like the government typically tries to stick its like checks in.
00:24:49.468 - 00:25:45.306, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I mean, at a very primitive level, when I first discovered bitcoin I said, hmm, well this could disintermediate money in state and that might not go down as smoothly as one might think. The optimist in me says and all to regulators is a smart contract cannot be manipulated in the same way that order books or centralized parties can. And so from that perspective, everyone is treated equally. When you're interacting with a smart contract, it can be hacked for sure. There's risk on the code, but the smart contract, the programmability of money is the most fascinating thing that I think benefits consumers. The amount of consumers surplus it will be created in this industry is massive because there's more transparency, there's more competition, there's more consumer choice. And what we need to focus on is I think consumer protection, not everyone should be able to use some of these instruments like derivatives or be super levered.
00:25:45.306 - 00:26:41.660, Speaker B: I think we need as an industry, and I think this is something that I am very focused on, is self policing and adopting good front ends and adopting good standards like whitelisting, having a reputation layer where similar to like the accreditation rule is very, very bare bones. It's so arbitrary that it's like, how is it that, like, why 200k? Or I forget the rule, like, why a million? And why does that make you a sophisticated investor? Well, I think we can do much, much better than that. Right? Because data blockchains are data rich. They have an entire, your wallet address, has an entire history and snapshots of your level of sophistication. And I would argue that you can create and construct a really interesting credit profile and get a really good feeling of what that person and the level of sophistication of said wallet or the person who's behind that wallet. And then you say, okay, that's your FiCO score, right? Essentially. And then that will determine which protocols you can actually unlock and which features you can actually get access to.
00:26:41.660 - 00:27:07.952, Speaker B: There's a really interesting protocol called Rabbit Hole, which is started by one of the guys who is a dapper, so really, really consumer centric. And that's the whole thing. Like, your wallet is your resume and that allows you to. You go through these quests similar to, like, earn.com, and you need to, like, get badges to then, like, be like, hey, like, this is actually a person that is very sophisticated. He can therefore, if x, then y. So, yeah, like, long winded.
00:27:07.952 - 00:27:30.582, Speaker B: I don't know. I think there will be backlash. Yes. There will always be regulatory concerns. I think where I'm most focused on is, I think for the most part, I think the smart regulators understand that this is probably as powerful as the Internet, and you want to be pro innovation. There's a lot of really smart people that continue to, like, enter the space. Knee jerk reaction regulations don't necessarily work as well.
00:27:30.582 - 00:27:35.526, Speaker B: Whereas I think just having an open mind and open dialogue with industry and regulators is the best thing we can do.
00:27:35.590 - 00:27:59.036, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you. I think ultimately, like, the software is a, like, creates transparency, right? It create. It, like, eliminates fraud. And that's a long term trend that I think a lot of the folks that are in government actually want. This is what they geek out upon, right. It's like, how do we. How do we actually eliminate the possibility of bad actors?
00:27:59.220 - 00:28:05.852, Speaker B: Let me pose a question for you. Do you think the financial crisis would have happened to the severity that it did if everything was on chain?
00:28:05.908 - 00:28:46.288, Speaker A: No, I don't. Like, I think, like, if bitcoin existed 30 years prior, the collapse of the Soviet Union wouldn't have been as terrible for the humans there. The horrors of, like, like a sovereign government falling apart and, like, the monetary rebasing that happens is terrifying. You know, for myself and like me at a younger stage with like bunch of my career still ahead, it doesn't seem as scary. But like for anyone that's retired, anyone that's older, like the risks of that kind of level of collapse are astronomical. And bitcoin actually is like a huge hedge against that. That's awesome.
00:28:46.288 - 00:29:01.654, Speaker A: Right. That was kind of seared into my mind as like in that I was eleven years old, like kind of growing up, so I wasn't quite facing it directly. But I do remember like my parents and my relatives having to go through that, so.
00:29:01.824 - 00:29:23.002, Speaker B: Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, similar to you. And I'm from Mexico. And I'll tell you, no one ever thinks of storing their, their hard earned savings in pesos because you've seen it, you've seen the devaluations in 94 and continuously where people like to think in dollars. But then what happens when you see m two and m one supply like skyrocket?
00:29:23.098 - 00:29:51.066, Speaker A: Yeah. And like, I think because of bitcoin, I think the, the damage is basically buffered. Like there's a way to buffer it. Like people can take hedges or they'll, they'll do it. Right? Like they'll, they'll figure it out. And that's a huge driver for that level of adoption, which I think is important and will probably like keep the sovereign money afloat longer than it should. Or like eliminate those huge kind of failure points.
00:29:51.210 - 00:30:47.548, Speaker B: Yeah. I think at best it introduces a greater level of accountability in sovereign monetary policy, where once you have something that's non sovereign and interesting, it just holds people to a higher degree of accountability and transparency and a way of doing things that once people expect more transparency, more accountability, then it just, it's sort of like Heisenberg principle of sorts, which is like once you understand that there's a watch keeper, someone's observing the system and everyone's observing it, then it just. The optimist to me says it influences behavior at the nation state level in a way that perhaps nation state ends up becoming more like a corporation. Because what this is all doing is shattering this notion of man made artificial boundaries where money flows at the speed of information across the world. And once you do that and labor. Right. You know, open source developers and these communities transcend borders and gender and any sort of biases.
00:30:47.548 - 00:31:29.554, Speaker B: Right. And you're really valued by your contribution and just by your contributions. And that level of meritocratic, like almost like free market where anyone can move around. Sure. You might be stuck in a particular geography. But I think there will be nations like Estonia and some of the caribbean islands and some folks in Singapore that are ahead of the curve and become much, much more competitive in the same way that, like, companies compete for talent. I think you're going to start seeing that shift, like a tectonic shift in how capital and labor moves at a global scale, and at best, that kind of collapses, like these man made, like, hegemonic forces that have existed for other reasons.
00:31:29.554 - 00:31:37.214, Speaker B: But I think now my thesis is countries become more like corporations and it becomes a much more competitive market with crypto.
00:31:37.554 - 00:31:42.888, Speaker A: I don't know if you heard Balaji talk about this, but I have, like, a counter opinion, and this is.
00:31:43.056 - 00:31:43.760, Speaker B: I want to hear it.
00:31:43.792 - 00:32:42.934, Speaker A: I don't know. I think a similar narrative is that Silicon Valley kind of lost its monopoly on intelligent folks looking for funding, and Wall street lost its monopoly on, like, ipos, right? You can now, like, do all of this on the Internet. You and I have never, like, actually shook hands. Right? Like, yeah. So you can build those relationships, like, over the Internet and at a global level and do it all globally. But I think I guess maybe because I have a family, I see that as almost freeing me to stay in Asaf and invest in that city and become actually more locally integrated. To me, that's something I don't know if you heard of the term mutual aid networks, where you have people that have your back in the Soviet Union, because the overall system sucked, like, the foundational, like governments, everything was so terrible that you just relied on, like, your local networks, like, the humans around you.
00:32:42.934 - 00:32:47.450, Speaker A: And where you have those, I think is, like, really critical. It's really hard to move those.
00:32:47.602 - 00:33:09.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think humans are social beings. I think that is a key distinction of humans and what makes us. We're social animals, you know? And I think I definitely agree with you, like, especially in Latin America. So true, too. Like, your family, your extended family is super strong, and those bonds or what keeps you at a particular city in a particular region. So I definitely agree with you. I think now you can move.
00:33:09.180 - 00:33:45.472, Speaker B: You can port over that entire, like, nucleus, right? And just move it somewhere else, presumably. It's hard, for sure, but, like, you sort of saw it in Venezuela, where a lot of people just have to move, and a lot of people were moving with their seed phrase in their head with a lot of the capital. Like, let me pose another question. Like, you know, how would World War Two would have shaken out if all the folks who got persecuted had the ability to store their wealth digitally and not fire sale their entire companies, their assets. What would have that done to fund resistance to be able to move quickly? I think that's powerful.
00:33:45.608 - 00:33:53.144, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think it just wouldn't have even happened. I think that, yeah, I mean, wars.
00:33:53.184 - 00:34:24.834, Speaker B: Are one purely on economical basis, and I think the ability to store meaningful sums of wealth that are outside the purview of perhaps states that try to do malicious stuff, I think it's really powerful. Again, this is like the sovereign individual at its best. I want to go back to something you said, which is interesting. Balaji mentioned it, and I think you alluded to it around this idea. What's going on in San Francisco? Silicon Valley is a very strong community. I don't think it's going away necessarily. There's.
00:34:24.834 - 00:34:51.625, Speaker B: Are you familiar with the, like, O ring theory? This is like Nobel Prize two years ago where. So the O ring is like, what caused the challenger accident, which you're probably familiar with, like. Like, Feynman was the one that said, like, a very. The theory is as follows. A very simple low level component in a very complex system can cause total chaos, can. Can literally implode. And the O ring was that plastic thing that held together part of the rocket and unfortunately caused a challenger accidentally.
00:34:51.625 - 00:35:24.882, Speaker B: And it really teaches, like, these are very complex social graphs and systems. To me, it's interesting because, like, could San Francisco lose its place as a hub of innovation, maybe in crypto? Yes, it's possible. Very possible. And I think all of this starts, like, these complex system, and Jeffrey west kind of talks about it in scale, which is the faster a system expands the rate of innovation, the rate of growth needs to also increase. Otherwise you're bound to collapse at some point. Like, it's sort of a parabola. Like, once you reach a certain point, you're too big, and then if you're not growing as fast, you collapse.
00:35:24.882 - 00:35:50.712, Speaker B: And it'll be interesting. I think open source communities, like, probably are better suited to, like, avoid that trap. You know, you reach a state of, like, stagnation. Unfortunately, some of these is San Francisco at a place of, like, state, like stagnation, and people became too complacent or too elitist, maybe. I think certain things are not helping it. But, yeah, it'd be interesting. I mean, for me, that's one of the more fascinating things of this space you've probably saw.
00:35:50.712 - 00:35:57.984, Speaker B: I mean, how many developers of Solana, where is the team distributed? Like, where are these teams coming from? Is it. Do they need to fly to Palo Alto and Sandhill Road to meet.
00:35:58.064 - 00:36:28.970, Speaker A: No, none of our engineers are actually in SF. One of the last guy that was, again, a former Qualcomm person that was there working remotely at Qualcomm before he joined Solana is now moving to Italy. Right. So he kind of, like, the world has really shifted in terms of where you want to live, which I think frees you up to pick the place where you want to live regardless of job opportunities, because you now have this global network to do your business, to.
00:36:29.002 - 00:37:11.898, Speaker B: Actually do that, especially at this intersection of AI. And I think there will be radical labor shifts in the composition of label force. A lot of these things, fortunately, unfortunately, depending on how you want to see it, are going to be automated. And then what happens then? And I think open source communities offer a window to a lot of these people, a lot of folks, to say, hey, there's an opportunity here to contribute in these communities. There's a way to actually monetize it as well and get paid for your contributions in a very meaningful way. And so I look at that, and I think that's the optimist in me that says, at this intersection of, like, I think with COVID people realize remote work is possible. You don't have to be bound by these industrial revolution constructs of nine to five bullshitness.
00:37:11.898 - 00:37:33.490, Speaker B: People think freely, maybe think better in other environments. I think collaboration and human face to face is super important. Conferences are important. Maybe virtual reality gets us there. But generally speaking, like, I totally agree with you. I've never met you in person. The last time I met my team was a year over a year ago, and we've gone through a lot, and I think maybe that's what's shifting.
00:37:33.490 - 00:38:07.210, Speaker B: People are critical of social media. It's like, that's not a real friendship. A digital friend, a friend of Facebook on the Internet is. Is not what a friend is supposed to look like. What are you, what are you talking about? I have a lot of friends on crypto Twitter that I share much, much more values, principles, beliefs, and I interact with them daily, perhaps more than my childhood friends, you know? So what is this construct of nationalism like? I don't know. I think esports, I mean, people might be more passionate about their crypto kiddies and esports than they are about, like, their Olympic team in Tokyo Olympics. You know what I mean? I don't know.
00:38:07.210 - 00:38:08.630, Speaker B: Maybe I'm too crazy.
00:38:08.782 - 00:38:10.874, Speaker A: Unless it's soccer, the World cup.
00:38:12.134 - 00:38:14.114, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
00:38:16.374 - 00:38:36.074, Speaker A: But, yeah, like, being a fan is like, becoming. I don't know, that's an interesting side note, are you a fan, are you like a fan of a sport or a music or like, like you got. You gotta be like rooting for the mexican national team during the World cup, right?
00:38:38.334 - 00:38:44.434, Speaker B: Yeah. Unfortunately, my ability to root goes down because they never get past quarterfinals.
00:38:45.254 - 00:38:57.774, Speaker A: Well, we're coming up on the hour. I'd love to hear your last thoughts on building this upper layer application for those early founders that are thinking of jumping into the space.
00:38:57.934 - 00:39:39.836, Speaker B: Yeah, it's super interesting. I think we're at a pivotal moment of this industry where it reminds me a lot of what Google and Amazon did for the Internet, where people start waking up, okay, there's a very productive ecosystem, there's killer use cases, there's real traction here. But I think for founders the message would be the design space is vast, super vast. Like we were barely scratching the surface of what is possible. Not everything is copying what exists into the traditional world, at least in DeFi, it's new primitives that are coming up like flash loans or, or like a disintersection of nfts and finance and like creating transparent price discovery for illiquid assets. So I think it's super interesting. The primary barometer of this space is human capital.
00:39:39.836 - 00:40:06.698, Speaker B: And I think we're seeing more and more. And you in this hackathon is super interesting. Like the caliber of engineers, the caliber product folks entering the space and thinkers is like order of magnitude of what it was in 2017. And I think that's always, for me, that's always been the leading indicator. It's like I always take stock at something good will come out of like these open source communities where the compounding rates of innovation are like this. Right. And sort of the cathedral closed source model is sort of like more static.
00:40:06.698 - 00:40:59.098, Speaker B: And so I think that is like super encouraging. I saw in the hackathon really interesting ideas, not only like porting over what existed in Ethereum and DeFi, but also like new primitives, which is, I guess the question maybe for, is someone else in the audience or some other founders is what are some of the use cases that haven't been built because you couldn't have like gotten them off the ground or just. It was, it was really challenging in an environment of, there's friction, we know them in Ethereum, like there's high gas and, and there's limitations to it, which is like a growing pains of a network getting adoption. But what are some of the other use cases that are possible in an environment where, you know, it is like much faster and it offers different, it's just a different design choice. So my view is I think we're going back to, like, rounding out the discussion. There's a lot of tribalism in the space, for sure. I think that's natural, that's human instinct, nature.
00:40:59.098 - 00:41:22.296, Speaker B: It appeals to how we want to affiliate ourselves with. But, uh, I would just caution people to be maximalist. Like, I never understood, like, bitcoin maximalist. Like, you realize that if you're rigid in your thinking, in a space that is innovating so quickly, you're going to be left behind. And so I think the best that one can do is just be open about different things that are happening in the space. We're always, I think, ascribe to that ethos. And so, yeah, I'm very, very excited.
00:41:22.296 - 00:42:17.360, Speaker B: I think it's not win lose. I think to say that, like, one success of one protocol, one is detrimental to the other. I understand that win lose like mentality, but I think a lot of this because we're so early, because we're building and unlocking so much friction that exists in finance, at least in finance in other areas, too, it's mostly win win. And I think, like, I hope that more people in the community thought this way because it's always like, you know, I understand that you have a vested interest in a particular project or protocol, but be a little open minded. It's what got you here in the first place, probably, of being open minded, being like, what is this crazy, magical Internet money? Let me learn about that. And, like, I think we should never lose that as a community, that ability to experiment with new things. Because the minute we lose that, then we just become exactly like the players that we're trying to disintermediate, not because we hate them, purely because there's just a lot of goddamn friction.
00:42:17.360 - 00:42:37.748, Speaker B: I'm just fucking tired of people paying exorbitant fees and not being transparency in the system. And I think we're moving to a place that is brighter and offers. It's like if you open the door and you saw a way of doing things that solve a lot of the issues that are facing today in this world, and once you open that door, it's like, all right, balls to the wall. Like, let's go.
00:42:37.836 - 00:42:48.864, Speaker A: That's awesome, man. I don't know if I could have closed this letter ever myself. This is going to be our, like, our call to action.
00:42:50.764 - 00:42:52.900, Speaker B: Yeah. Rally the troops. Let's go.
00:42:53.052 - 00:42:56.988, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. Thank you so much.
00:42:57.076 - 00:42:58.004, Speaker B: Yeah, guys, this is great.
00:42:58.044 - 00:42:59.636, Speaker A: This is great.
00:42:59.780 - 00:43:09.340, Speaker B: Yeah. Continue to. Continue to build, and I'm super excited to, to stay on top of what you guys are doing and more projects in Defi and Solana, and I think we'll definitely be looking out for that.
00:43:09.412 - 00:43:10.636, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much.
00:43:10.700 - 00:43:12.424, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you, guys. Cool.
