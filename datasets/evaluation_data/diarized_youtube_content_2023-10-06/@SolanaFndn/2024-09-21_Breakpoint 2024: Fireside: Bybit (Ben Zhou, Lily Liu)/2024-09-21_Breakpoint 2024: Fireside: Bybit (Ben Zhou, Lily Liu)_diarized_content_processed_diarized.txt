00:00:09.640 - 00:00:10.504, Speaker A: Yeah, that's you.
00:00:10.569 - 00:00:11.525, Speaker B: All right, good.
00:00:12.905 - 00:00:14.129, Speaker A: All right. What's up, Ben?
00:00:14.217 - 00:00:17.225, Speaker B: It's great to be here. Amazing event. Amazing event.
00:00:17.385 - 00:00:30.421, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. It's awesome to have you here. I think the first time we actually met in person was this time last year. Yeah, yeah. Actually, we gifted Ben one of the sakaphones, which ended up being actually pretty valuable. Memento.
00:00:30.493 - 00:00:32.225, Speaker B: Yes. Very, very good.
00:00:33.605 - 00:00:49.945, Speaker A: So I'm curious, Bybit has been breaking all sorts of barriers and doing an incredible job over the last couple of years. I even wanted to learn for myself. How did you get into crypto? What's your background? What's the founding story of Bybit?
00:00:51.485 - 00:01:22.633, Speaker B: We founded in 2018. Back then, what my background, I was running a retail forex exchange. So I was always facing retail, doing kind of an exchange, part of the business. By 2017, you know, I really got into crypto because all these ICOs lost a bunch of money. And I want to find out an area that I'm good at. I want to devote into the industry. At the time, there were only two exchanges being bitmax and okx, that offers derivatives.
00:01:22.633 - 00:01:50.537, Speaker B: For me, my forte is on the margin and derivatives trading. When I look at the exchange at the time, it was really very simple. Compared to now, it was really just a website. And typically whenever market moves, there's overload, you simply kind of open the exchange. So for me, I felt like traders deserve a much better trading experience. And that's how kind of Bybit was founded. Idea was trading everything by Bitcoin.
00:01:50.537 - 00:02:02.313, Speaker B: So by bit, or we say trading the world bit by bit. That's kind of our initial slogan, but now we're a whole ecosystem. We have spot, we have fiat, we have pretty much all the products.
00:02:02.409 - 00:02:18.035, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. And for folks here, it sometimes seems like exchanges are all kind of very similar to one another. And so what's different about Bybit versus other exchanges?
00:02:18.495 - 00:02:45.393, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's a good question. I think at least for the top players, we have different strategies. I think with the last kind of previous circle on how exchanges position themselves. Is that actually in this industry position? Well, exchange has been the meme kind of centered. The stage. Where I see. We see exchange should be the one setting up the stage and let the ecosystem, the projects go on the stage.
00:02:45.393 - 00:03:26.535, Speaker B: So we see ourselves as completely infrastructure players. And this is why Bybit, we don't have our own ecosystem or in a way that we don't have our own chain, our own type of, this type of web3play, but we take clients and field web tool Adoption to Solana, to other ecosystems, that's one thing. And we've been always very open on working with different partners. By Bit was the first one to work with Circle at usdc. We're the first one working with Athena usde. Now we are, I think we want to be the big supporter of Solana ecosystem. So we've always been working with players.
00:03:26.535 - 00:03:28.335, Speaker B: That's I think one of the main differences.
00:03:28.455 - 00:03:49.115, Speaker A: Got it. And how do you think about. Sometimes people think that centralized finance or CEFI and DEFI can even be competing with one another because after all one could say that liquidity, there's only so much in the ecosystem. And so what's your perspective on that? Where they are collaborative and where they may also be competitive with one another?
00:03:50.255 - 00:04:11.691, Speaker B: I think to our perspective they are not competing at all. It's complimenting our job. Again, we build a road, the bridge to take people to wherever they want. And this is why Bybit is launching. We were building the Web3 wallet. We also see that other exchanges are building their Web3 wallet. So that I think at the end of the day, you know, we don't build a city.
00:04:11.691 - 00:04:47.157, Speaker B: Solana, you are the city. We take clients to you. If it's for example, new clients who don't know much about crypto, they need something that's familiar with the email registration they can get access to, then we take them there. At the same time, if you want explore web3 and you need something similar, the exchange offers that as well. Because typically you see that with Web3 wallet you need a lot of investment, a lot of infrastructure. And this is where the central exchange have the resources, the manpower to build these big massive web3 wallet to support these type of functions.
00:04:47.301 - 00:05:05.545, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. So recently there's been a couple of new LSTs on the market. BB soldier, new baby. Yes, yes, yes. And so how does that play into the CEFI DeFi like the Web3 strategy of Bybit?
00:05:06.685 - 00:06:08.405, Speaker B: Again, we don't really distinguish. It's one of the biggest ask from our community, from our users is that, hey, you know, there's all these different Solana LSDs and Solana being one of the most adapted ecosystem and you have a lot of token holders on Bybit who want to use Solana to trade as collateral, but at the same time earning a yield. So for us it's quite normal and very easy just to say, hey, we discussed with the team, how do we participate in this LSD ecosystem so that allows our users, while holding Solana can earn the yield and trade at the same time. So it's really from that perspective. But I think the team is also talking to Solana team extremely close to figuring out what are some of the other ways we can take this forward. So I mean, what's your perspective on exchange? I think all the major ones are launching LSDs. What's your perspective and what do you think these LSD plays in your ecosystem?
00:06:08.565 - 00:07:06.281, Speaker A: I think it's great because I think that Solana has one of the most diverse staking ecosystems by a long shot. Right. And one of the most diverse and also one of the most innovative staking ecosystems. And as it is, I think, what is it? Over 200 million users in crypto are using centralized exchange exchanges. It still is the number one kind of channel of adoption and product market fit, user market fit in this entire industry as the additional use cases get built out. And so given that having sort of diversity of assets that provide users with what they want, I think it's pretty cool. In addition, I think that the more there's representation of those assets in the primary venues of liquidity, the more that you can create people in the ecosystem start to create interesting products like using LSTs for collateral and that helps also in my mind boost the entire ecosystem.
00:07:06.281 - 00:07:11.721, Speaker A: So it's all about once you have liquidity, certain asset. And there's a lot of economic loops that can be built around that.
00:07:11.873 - 00:07:53.693, Speaker B: Yeah. One trend we're seeing is the moment we're launching BB Sol, which is the Bybit lst. You will start to see other clients who are not holding Solana will be switching to Solana because they want to be earning a yield on top of whatever they're trading. Because now all the exchanges are supporting multi margin system. So you can use any token to trade anything, whether it's Bitcoin or Ethereum. So it's really kind of helping the token holders that if you believe in the system, you believe in this ecosystem, you can just hold and keep earning. And that kind of gives Solana a competitive advantage compared to other tokens that don't have the SRC so easily.
00:07:53.829 - 00:08:02.865, Speaker A: Yeah. So what's next on Bybit's radar? Not necessarily as regards the Solana ecosystem, but what are kind of like the next few things that you're focused on?
00:08:03.245 - 00:08:56.632, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one area we want to really focus on is the Web3 wallet. Currently I think you have other exchanges doing a really good job. We think that we really need to invest into this aspect more, giving our self custodian wallet more of a Capability, more infrastructure to connect into multiple ecosystem as well as offer users some airdrops and basically the extra layer of safety. One kind of innovation we're doing is that how can we help clients to prevent scams and fraud on a self custodian wallet. So what we're doing is using a centralized way. Basically if client is inputting an address that we labeled in our big data system as a scam, we will have a big pop out to tell users this is really a scam address. You gotta be careful.
00:08:56.632 - 00:09:26.015, Speaker B: So this is done by a centralized team, but at the same time the team is looking into potentially if a client is is already transferring a big sum amount, we could have another team hijacking the price, the fees to block that transaction for the users. So these are some of the centralized ways to handle, I guess from our perspective to help the clients a bit. But end goal is to protect users and make sure they have a better experience. Yeah, yeah.
00:09:26.355 - 00:09:40.185, Speaker A: So Bybit having started off as derivatives exchange and now expanded into other trading products, what do you think about this sometimes critique of crypto which is that the only use case of crypto is speculation. That's a debate we had yesterday.
00:09:42.765 - 00:10:30.925, Speaker B: Well, it's a good thing, I think whatever drives users into this industry, I wouldn't criticize it. I mean without, I want to be honest, perfectly honest, without the speculation, maybe a lot of us won't be in this room at least without that first part to get us into the industry. Right. So I think that part is probably the first for a lot of people who find out about this industry and learn and then they start to notice technology can really change the world, can really do many different things and this is why we start to really get involved and get into the whole thing. So I think it's one way to look at it. But anyway it's good to get users in. So our job is to get users in, fuel mass adoption, whatever way can be done.
00:10:30.925 - 00:10:31.909, Speaker B: We don't really care.
00:10:31.957 - 00:10:51.625, Speaker A: Yeah. And what do you think about the evolution of various financial use cases beyond more the trading and liquidity oriented stuff as people get into payments and into. A number of other folks in the industry have put together P2P payment networks and those types of extensions of the financial ecosystem. What do you think about that?
00:10:52.175 - 00:11:47.659, Speaker B: Yeah, I think crypto is becoming so big now that different parts of the world views crypto in a very different way. Give you example, we have a crypto card in Argentina and it's been adopted really fast. Reason being is the local currency is not Doing so well. We cannot imagine if there's no crypto what the local people do with hyperinflation. So you can see their behavior is very different than let's say Japanese users and by they would switch their salary immediately into stable coins or Solana or these tokens and they will use it as a bank, use Bybit as a bank app to daily access, use the cryptocurrency to buy, go shopping and buy coffee and doing really that aspect. So for these countries cryptos really become their day to day and replacing their financial systems. So I think that's one way.
00:11:47.659 - 00:11:57.575, Speaker B: And you have other countries that's really good at airdrops, other countries really good at trading. So it's more covering different aspects.
00:11:58.475 - 00:12:08.775, Speaker A: And here in Southeast Asia and really this part of the world, what are the primary use cases and how do people use crypto here in Southeast Asia?
00:12:09.595 - 00:13:00.297, Speaker B: Southeast Asia it's also quite different. I would say Chinese users, Korean and Japanese are mainly using for trading purpose. So I would say majority of these retail users view crypto as a way to quick get rich quick basically. So a lot of leverage, high level trading, a lot of new listed asset trading. So whenever there's new listings, new projects being listed on exchange, these countries typically get very hyped up on that. And then I think for Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand they actually focus more on spot, they're very into like new token meme coins, these type of things. Not so much on the derivative side of trading.
00:13:00.297 - 00:13:08.417, Speaker B: So you start to see different kind of patterns of different players. I don't know what is your perspective on Southeast Asia users from Solana perspective?
00:13:08.521 - 00:13:47.225, Speaker A: Well, it's something that I'm trying to learn more about. My perception of Southeast Asia is that you have a lot of like currency fragmentation replaced like Southeast Asia. So you have relatively mature economies, a lot of currency fragmentation that also sit between hegemons of I guess the South Asia and North Asia. Right. So I wonder, I wonder even though this is potentially interesting, you know you come from an FX background, but I wonder at some point, I wonder if when are we actually going to start to have FX markets come on chain? Right. Right now it's all. I don't know what the dominance of USD stablecoins are, but it's significant, it's extremely dominant.
00:13:47.225 - 00:13:57.923, Speaker A: Will there be actually markets on chain or you know, back to the other. Is it really just all about speculation which means it's going to be US dollar oriented economy?
00:13:58.059 - 00:14:25.559, Speaker B: No, we were seeing. So typically for the markets the clients are very good at trading. They have that desire. We actually listed, we have a new product called MT5 that's listed. We start see these countries I mentioned, like Japan, Korea, Europe too are very good at trading Forex. So in the product we have Forex. Especially as in last week with the US Fed dropping rates, there's a lot of volatility with EURUSD and Gold.
00:14:25.559 - 00:14:45.903, Speaker B: So these clients are trading. So for exchange, like us, we have traders that are hardcore and looking for volatilities. If you ask them what's new token this ecosystem, they're like, well I don't care, I don't know, I'm just here for the volatility. So. But then you have, I think your audience is more into the tech, the ecosystem play. So it's different, very different players.
00:14:46.039 - 00:14:56.273, Speaker A: Got it, got it. So lastly any, anything new on the near term horizon for Bybit? Any alpha we can share with the crowd here.
00:14:56.409 - 00:15:05.561, Speaker B: We need to support Solana Mall so we want to see more projects coming in. So let us know guys. You see, very good.
00:15:05.753 - 00:15:13.353, Speaker A: I got to say also thank you very much for Bybit for just being such a big supporter of Solana ecosystem. It's really been great.
00:15:13.449 - 00:15:14.485, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you.
00:15:15.385 - 00:15:15.905, Speaker A: Thanks guys.
