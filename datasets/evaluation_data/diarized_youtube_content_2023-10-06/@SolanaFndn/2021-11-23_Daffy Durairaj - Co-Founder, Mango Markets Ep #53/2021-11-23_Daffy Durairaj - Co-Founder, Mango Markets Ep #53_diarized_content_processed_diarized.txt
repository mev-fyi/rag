00:00:09.520 - 00:00:19.190, Speaker A: Hey, folks, this is anatoly, and you're listening to the Solana podcast. And today I have with me Daffy Diriraj, who's the co founder of Mango Markets. So awesome to have you.
00:00:19.302 - 00:00:21.878, Speaker B: Yeah, it's great to be here.
00:00:21.966 - 00:00:29.106, Speaker A: So, you know, origin story, how'd you get into crypto? What made you. What made you build mango markets?
00:00:29.210 - 00:01:01.534, Speaker B: How did I get into crypto? So I started off really not wanting to get into crypto. I was really interested in algorithmic trading, did that in college, and wanted to. Did some competitions that I did well in, and I wanted to trade equities. But it turns out if you have not enough money, if you have a few thousand dollars, it's not allowed. You're not allowed to algorithmically trade. There's a pattern day trader rule. And I was just infuriated, and I was looking around, and I found Poloniex, where you could do anything you want.
00:01:01.534 - 00:01:35.574, Speaker B: The thing that actually hooked me first to Poloniex was the lending market, because I immediately, as soon as I saw an open lending market, I was like, oh, wow, I have to buy some bitcoin, and I have to lend it out. And Poloniex was all bitcoin. And then I gradually got into just the meat of it, which was algorithmic trading. And everything about crypto seemed exciting, but I actually didn't want to hold bitcoin. Poloniex was all bitcoin. But again, I think the government sort of pushed me in the right direction. I was like, okay, I don't want to hold bitcoin.
00:01:35.574 - 00:02:02.446, Speaker B: I'll hedge off my risk on bitmax, but again, not open to us persons. And so I was kind of reluctantly holding bitcoin and thinking, all right, I have a few thousand dollars. If things go bad in this whole bitcoin thing, I'll come out, okay, I'll get a job or whatever. But, yeah, I just never got a job. You know, just kept holding bitcoin, and that's. And continuing to trade crypto. And I did that for about five years.
00:02:02.446 - 00:02:43.052, Speaker B: Then I. Well, I wanted to actually start trading on chain, because I thought this was probably for a lot of the reasons that you built Solana, you know, like, the censorship resistance, and, like, the global liquidity of it and, like, the openness of it. The fact that, you know, you're not excluding people that have, like, a few thousand dollars. I wanted to build on chain, and I was just not very bullish on a lot of things. So I kept going back to trading, and then I saw serum Dex and I was just hooked. Like, I was just, you know, I placed a trade, and it felt totally natural and normal. It wasn't like, you know, like $40 and takes 20 seconds and you don't know if it.
00:02:43.052 - 00:02:58.210, Speaker B: And then the metamask is jammed. You're like, oh, but how do I cancel this? So, yeah, long. Those are those long winded way of saying was a trader. And then I started, and then I saw serum Dex, and then I had to start building the tools that would make serum Dex even more fun.
00:02:58.282 - 00:03:20.972, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah, kind of. I got into it by trading, basically, I set up, like, a interactive broker's IrA account. And that let me kind of, like, bypass the rules, really, with, like, very small amount of money. I think they probably closed these loopholes already. I, like, wrote a bunch of stuff on top of their Java SDK and started trading there.
00:03:21.028 - 00:04:00.304, Speaker B: But, yeah, I remember I actually got started that way, too. I did a bunch of stuff with their Java SDK. So we can tell you, we're both programmers. We wanted to build, like, this money machine, right? It's so fascinating. And, oh, it's a machine that prints things and prints money. How much more? What more could you want? So, yeah, I got started with interactive brokers, but I guess, like, the whole IRA thing, because I was, like, a college student, and so, I don't know, even talking to an accountant would, like, take a huge dent out of my network.
00:04:00.424 - 00:04:46.574, Speaker A: Totally. It's all really not designed for the whole financial system in trading in the US is designed to funnel retail towards an app like e trader Robinhood, which takes a cut and then sells that trade to somebody else who take a cut and then ten other people until it gets to an exchange. And that's how, like, everybody's protecting their neck, right? Yeah, they're, like, all taking a little slice. And I think what's cool about crypto is that even centralized exchange like, FTX is a thousand times better and less extractive of the users than anything in traditional finance, simply because they can guarantee settlement. Such a very simple thing.
00:04:47.594 - 00:05:19.408, Speaker B: I mean, you feel it right from the beginning. You go to Poloniex in 2016, it's like, oh, here you have an email, you've deposited bitcoin, and now you're just lending to people. So just talk about not being extractive. To see the order book through interactive brokers or ameritrade or whatever, costs you a lot of money, and it costs them a lot of money to provide it. And I actually, I don't think I'd ever seen an order book. This was like my passion. This is what I love to do.
00:05:19.408 - 00:05:43.980, Speaker B: And I never actually seen it. You know, there's that story of the blind men who are touching this elephant. And so I had kind of figured out kind of maybe what the order book looks like. But then on Poloniex, you go there and. And you just see the order book and you see all the lights flashing and you're like, oh, this is it. This is where the trades are happening and that's free. And you can.
00:05:43.980 - 00:06:01.088, Speaker B: And of course, a big part of mango markets as well is like, you can see the order book. That's it. That is it. There's nothing more. Yeah. And it's all on chain and all this stuff. So, yeah, in terms of not being extractive, it's a really big piece of what motivates people to come in.
00:06:01.156 - 00:06:23.484, Speaker A: I don't know if you ever tried to get data, like real data. I wanted timing information. When a bid comes in or when an ask comes in versus when it's filled, how do I get access to it? Because when you get data from any of these places, it's a little better than Yahoo. Finance, which is every five minutes to give you a low and a high.
00:06:25.904 - 00:06:30.714, Speaker B: I don't know. Did you ever succeed at doing that? Interactive brokers?
00:06:30.834 - 00:07:09.680, Speaker A: No, like, I recorded some of it, but it wasn't like, it just never had that fidelity. And I always felt like, okay, I'll build some models. And sometimes stuff would work locally against my simulations, but then whenever I would actually try to run it, I'd see that, like, fails take a little longer than they should. Right. And like, all the stuff just like, really feels like they're. You're not interacting directly with the trading system that somebody, like, when they see your order, they're like, well, maybe I'll get. Put my order ahead of yours or do whatever, right? Or slow.
00:07:09.680 - 00:07:13.600, Speaker A: Slow you down a bit. And it just. Yeah, just sucks.
00:07:13.752 - 00:07:48.040, Speaker B: Yeah, it feels very opaque. It's like a black box. And of course this is all for people like me who are kind of looking from the outside, looking in. So if I had gotten a job at Citadel or somewhere, then I could probably see what's actually happening. But the fact that the vast majority of people are gonna look at it and not really know what's actually happening, not everyone wants to see an order book, that's an important fact. But there are a large number of people who need it to be a little bit transparent, to be involved.
00:07:48.112 - 00:07:58.614, Speaker A: What I hate about it is that there's a lot of people that make a lot of money from you not seeing that they're like in the business of information asymmetry and fuck them.
00:08:00.354 - 00:08:15.574, Speaker B: Okay, so it's not a family friendly podcast, so it's good. I was gonna ask that, but. So there's a funny story, like, you know, on Runescape, I don't know if you've ever played Runescape.
00:08:15.914 - 00:08:20.854, Speaker A: I played Ultima online, which is like, I think similar vibes in the early days.
00:08:20.974 - 00:09:00.216, Speaker B: Yeah. So on Runescape, just like on the point of no one being able to see anything on Runescape, they also, they had an order book because that's the most natural thing to do. And I actually had to figure it out from first principles. I would place a trade and I would see that sometimes it would get executed and sometimes it would not get executed. Then I realized, okay, if I place a trade for these water runes or something, or like oak logs or something, and I put the price really high, it gets executed at some price. That's not the price that I set. And so, okay, and then I was able to like form this concept of okay, that's the asking price.
00:09:00.216 - 00:09:17.150, Speaker B: I didn't even have a terminology for this, you know, and then I did the same for set the price to zero and put a trade. And now I found the bid and now I can now make a lot of money actually underbidding the best asker and overbidding the best bid.
00:09:17.262 - 00:09:18.622, Speaker A: So you're market making.
00:09:18.798 - 00:09:41.544, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So it was, it's funny, I mean, I was reminded because you said like there's a lot of people who make a lot of money in you not knowing. And I just, I was just minting money. You know, it took me years to accumulate like a million gold pieces in Runescape and then I was able to just 30 exit in like a month.
00:09:44.444 - 00:09:58.556, Speaker A: Tibet. Runescape is not a cryptocurrency. It's really whoever's running Runescape, they're like missing a huge opportunity right now to just like go full crypto. Yeah.
00:09:58.580 - 00:10:16.110, Speaker B: You know, there was some talk about some NFT or something on Twitter that somebody was trying to encourage Jagex, the company, to get involved in crypto. Of course I tried to signal boost it, but eventually everyone falls in line.
00:10:16.302 - 00:10:20.434, Speaker A: How did you end up with the idea for mega markets?
00:10:21.294 - 00:11:16.676, Speaker B: I have to give credit to DydX. It was 2019 and I hadn't really considered that this was possible. I was heads down writing trading algorithms and trading crypto, just kind of holding all of my wealth in bitcoin and I was borderline bitcoin maxi on that, and just seeing Dy DX do it in those early days, now, of course, they're way more successful now. Those early days, seeing that you could do leverage trading on chain, and they kind of showed it as a proof of concept, which I just started pacing back and forth, like, oh, my God, this is changing my worldview completely. Ethereum was slow and whatever. So years went by, or actually, maybe just like a year. And then I saw serum Dex, where I felt finally, okay, all the pieces are in play.
00:11:16.676 - 00:11:52.520, Speaker B: And also, I wanted to market make on serum Dex, but I really need leverage. Like, I don't really need leverage. It just makes market making dramatically more efficient and safer. So, like, leverage is just this tool that people who are involved in the financial plumbing really, really need. And I wasn't there. I was like, okay, this is the time I'm gonna have to learn how to code smart contracts, which sounds like a very scary and daunting task, but it was not that bad.
00:11:52.712 - 00:12:00.570, Speaker A: I mean, the scary part was that you guys were building on platform that was, like, really rough around the edges at the time.
00:12:00.762 - 00:12:39.692, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, no one told me that it was really rough around the edges at the time, so maybe that was actually maybe important. You come in, and there was nothing to do. This was, like, august of 2020. Things were not locked down necessarily here in the United States, but people kind of scattered. Like, no one was hanging out in the major cities. They had kind of, like, went to go live with their families, as did I. And I fled San Francisco and went to a rural part of North Carolina.
00:12:39.692 - 00:13:14.774, Speaker B: So there's nothing going on, and you just have all the time in the world, and bitcoin is doing well. So that's funding you, like, in a way. Like, bitcoin is this big or crypto in general. It's all the people who bought it or own some crypto. As long as it's going up, it's funding whatever zany side projects you have in mind. So this is just a side project, or, like, okay, wouldn't it be cool if I could access this part of the world or this technology? And so that's why chewing glass. I mean, you've probably coined that term.
00:13:14.774 - 00:13:26.654, Speaker B: I don't know. That's why chewing glass wasn't so hard, you know, because that pressure to. You have all the time in the world, basically.
00:13:29.274 - 00:13:39.418, Speaker A: Basically, COVID and lockdowns were so boring that chewing glass to learn how to code smart contracts at Solana was like a reprieve.
00:13:39.546 - 00:13:40.254, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:40.554 - 00:13:41.706, Speaker A: From the boredom.
00:13:41.850 - 00:14:03.430, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And, you know, and I've heard, like, you kind of say, okay, a bear market is when everyone's coding to give the opposite perspective. I feel like a bull market. I'm much more chill. Oh, yeah, nothing really matters. Crypto is going up. It doesn't matter what I do.
00:14:03.430 - 00:14:28.000, Speaker B: I'm just going to have rent is going to be paid for, everything's going to be fine. Might as well engage in high variance new ideas, new projects. In a bear market, I'm very gotta grind. You know, I gotta squeeze out a couple more bits out of this trading algorithm because I gotta pay rent. Yeah. So that's the bullish case on bull.
00:14:28.032 - 00:14:37.960, Speaker A: Markets that you can try something crazy. Yeah. You know what? That is? Like, the point where people enter the space is in a bull market.
00:14:38.072 - 00:14:38.456, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:38.520 - 00:14:54.604, Speaker A: Is that they kind of, like, start coming in droves because they're like, everything is crazy. And I can also be part of the party, but it's hard as a founder to stay focused because you are in that high variance, high risk taking mindset.
00:14:54.684 - 00:15:27.384, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe there's that trade off during a bull market. There's a lot of things looking for your attention. In a bear market. It's very calm, or it can be. I mean, if you built up a lot of liabilities during the bull market that now you have to stay afloat with during the bear market. Now, maybe it's calm in the external world, but internally it's not calm. You're like, I got to do x, Y and Z today, every day.
00:15:27.384 - 00:15:30.844, Speaker B: There's that natural pressure.
00:15:31.004 - 00:15:37.892, Speaker A: So you decided to learn coding on smart contracts on Solana. How did you end up going from there into mango?
00:15:38.028 - 00:16:09.766, Speaker B: Initially, it was called Leveram. Well, not it. There was just an idea. And there was a command line tool where you could access the YouTube video. Might still be out there. And Max was out there somewhere on the Internet, and he saw it and he thought it was a great idea until he reached out to me and we did some other things, like speculated about a prediction market, and then. Then we were like, okay, no one's going to build margin trading.
00:16:09.766 - 00:16:27.526, Speaker B: A lot of people are saying it, but it doesn't look like if we just wait, it's just going to happen, like, in the next couple of weeks or something. It's probably. We just have to build it. No, we just have to. But we totally should. This is clearly, like, a very important piece of the Solana ecosystem. So we started.
00:16:27.526 - 00:16:49.428, Speaker B: Yeah, we started building it. Mango was just. We were thinking, like, alliteration is good, and everybody loves mangoes. It's a fruit that's. I have never heard of anybody who doesn't like mangoes. It's probably the high sugar content and mango margin was the idea. But then we got the domain mango markets.
00:16:49.428 - 00:17:21.156, Speaker B: It's kind of evolved now. When you're starting off with something, you have narrow scope. You're like, yeah, just want to be able to borrow money. And now there's this mango dao, and people are talking about nfts and drones and. Okay, I'm talking about drones. I don't know if anybody else is, but it's just gone way higher. And now I'm like, yeah, I'm a humble servant of the mango dao.
00:17:21.156 - 00:17:24.412, Speaker B: And that seems totally a normal thing to say.
00:17:24.508 - 00:17:25.548, Speaker A: How big is the dao?
00:17:25.636 - 00:17:34.720, Speaker B: How big is the dao? That's a good question. In humans, that's like a philosophical question in human terms.
00:17:34.832 - 00:17:35.192, Speaker A: Wow.
00:17:35.248 - 00:18:21.910, Speaker B: Again, even still a philosophical question. So I think if you go to mango token, if you go to the solana explorer and just type in mango or mango or something, you could probably, I don't know if they have a list of unique token addresses. So in some sense, that's the doubt. But in terms of the number of people who actively post on the forums and make proposals, that's much smaller. I'm guessing there's thousands of people who have votes, but the number of people who make proposals and add meaningful commentary on the forums is maybe 20 people. And that's. I mean, it's expanding a pretty quickly.
00:18:21.910 - 00:19:11.650, Speaker B: I always see new people coming in, but, yeah, and big. There's also not just people. There's, like, the wealth of the dao and, like, the cultural reach of the Dao, the spiritual significance of the tao, all of those, like, seem. Seem like aspects of size. You know, if you were to ask, how big is the Tao? Yeah, you know, you. You interviewed Balaji Srinivasan, and there's this idea that he had on Twitter that was like, a dao should buy land in Wyoming and send a drone to circle it. And this is kind of like a moon landing sort of, kind of thing, or some kind of significant breakthrough where the dao is controlling physical objects in the real world.
00:19:11.650 - 00:19:22.052, Speaker B: So this is very exciting to me, but it has nothing to do with margin trading. It's just like something exciting that maybe in the bear market, I don't know. I'll push to get this done.
00:19:22.148 - 00:19:24.484, Speaker A: Do you want the control to happen on chain?
00:19:24.564 - 00:20:01.308, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's necessary. Maybe not the total control, but some kind of signal that this is, you can kind of think of Congress authorizes a certain thing, and then the executive branch, does it make that link be as automated as possible? I think there's some useful, something useful there. At the very least, something exciting and interesting, kind of like the moon landing, where maybe there wasn't anything useful, but it was inspiring, for sure.
00:20:01.396 - 00:20:23.322, Speaker A: So the DAO, you guys decided you wanted to do something with leverage and lending, and how you guys launched was, like, really unique. I don't even know if people did this in Ethereum. Right. To me, I think this is the first time anyone's kind of done this style of launch. Can you talk about the design and how you guys thought of it and what you made those choices?
00:20:23.418 - 00:21:13.532, Speaker B: So people early to Solana may be familiar with the mango market caps and how that went, which some would argue is the first NFT on Solana. And that was done pretty much sort of like how nfts are typically done, where you just. There's a mad rush to grab the caps as soon as possible, and the price is swinging wildly. And there's a lot of people now, I think we put that together as an April fools kind of thing very quickly. And so it was great for what it did, but the experience from that was, okay, there's gonna be a lot of angry people. Like, if you do it in this way, where you. Where, you know, the DAO is raising funds, and this is like, the inception of the Dao.
00:21:13.532 - 00:21:33.114, Speaker B: The dao is. Is raising funds for insurance fund. You probably don't want it to just be distributed to the people who were the fastest to click. And that was, that was the idea. Like, we probably don't want that. It doesn't seem useful. Seems like a lot of angry people and a lot of frustrated people.
00:21:33.114 - 00:22:26.588, Speaker B: So, okay, so you take out the time component, you take out the luck component, and then you're left with, okay, you can just have this sort of auction that lasts 24 hours, but then what if, like, somebody comes in at the last moment and dumps in a huge amount of money and raises the price for everyone? You know, everyone gets the same price. So, you know, our design was. Will have a withdrawal period or a grace period at the end, the remaining 24 hours where if you kind of don't like the price, you can bail out. It had some flaws, and I think we knew about those flaws from the beginning. We were like, okay, we just pushed this game of chicken to a later point where someone can put in a lot of money and then to scare other people away, and then they pull out at the last second. And that did happen, but it's not clear if that was net positive or net negative.
00:22:26.716 - 00:22:34.404, Speaker A: And in summary, there's this 24 hours period where people deposit funds in for a fixed supply of tokens.
00:22:34.524 - 00:22:35.184, Speaker B: Correct.
00:22:35.564 - 00:22:52.144, Speaker A: And then the period's over. And now everybody knows what the total amount in the pod is for the token. And there's kind of this price that's created. And then if you don't like the price, you can withdraw the entire bid or as much as you want some. You can only reduce your bid.
00:22:52.224 - 00:22:52.576, Speaker B: Correct.
00:22:52.640 - 00:22:55.872, Speaker A: But you don't need to withdraw the entire bid. Right. You can just reduce it.
00:22:55.928 - 00:22:56.528, Speaker B: Correct? Yep.
00:22:56.576 - 00:23:05.400, Speaker A: So then that pushes the average price down at the same time. So as for every dollar you take out, you kind of get a better price per token.
00:23:05.472 - 00:23:16.976, Speaker B: And you see, and you see the price ticking up during the first 24 hours as more and more people are putting money in, and then the price ticking down over the next 24 hours.
00:23:17.080 - 00:23:39.808, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm, like, a huge fan of the setup because it, like, creates a lot of, like, there was a news. You guys made the news because it was like, almost all, half of the. All of USDC that was minted on Solana ended up in that smart contract was like 45% of it.
00:23:39.976 - 00:23:48.296, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I remember, actually, because we saw the US DC on Solana was 700 million the days before.
00:23:48.440 - 00:23:48.968, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:49.056 - 00:24:00.680, Speaker B: And then it had climbed up to, like, 1.1 billion or I don't know what the number was at the end, and there was 500 million in the contract at the end of the first 24 hours. That was not the intention.
00:24:00.752 - 00:24:01.832, Speaker A: It gets minted.
00:24:01.968 - 00:24:29.940, Speaker B: Yeah. And honestly, like, from. I think you can appreciate it better from the outside than from. From my point of view, for sure. And of course, I also can appreciate it better from, from the time distance, but that was not expected. We kind of knew that there would be a lot of money placed in the beginning and then money would go down. That was in all the documentation that we wrote, and that was expected.
00:24:29.940 - 00:25:07.172, Speaker B: And we had all these dev calls where everyone was always talking about it, and I was like, okay, come on. Literally, there isn't that much USDC in Solana, so it can't be that bad. But of course, I underweighted the possibility that someone can just mint a whole bunch new USDC is bring it in from somewhere. It definitely, it made the news, and there were a couple of other projects that did the same thing. And I wonder if maybe it's a one time kind of thing like the game only works once. You can't expect to scare people every time or use the tactic every time.
00:25:07.308 - 00:25:51.522, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe. I think a lot to be said that there was no other way to get mango tokens at all. So there was no private round, they were never listed anywhere. This was really the only way to get them. And the anticipation of a project, that was awesome. And from every other perspective, I think it's like what I always tell founders is that you should always raise the least amount for the highest price. The VC's have more power than you usually because they have more information, they look at many deals, people come to them, they have the money, but it's sometimes the founders have this asymmetry where they're the only ones without equity, they're the only ones with that token.
00:25:51.522 - 00:26:14.914, Speaker A: And that moment is like, if you can get everybody at the same time to compete for that thing, then you've kind of created the symmetry there and you maximize the capital raised for the DAO, for the project, for the community, and therefore that actually is a good thing. Right. You have more resources to build the vision. Yeah.
00:26:14.954 - 00:26:59.790, Speaker B: Although I'll clarify, I think that the DAO is still handing out a lot of tokens, so there's still a lot of ways to acquire mango tokens. And that was kind of the inception for the insurance fund. The DAO has been paying people out of the insurance fund and so it's been useful, but there's still more tokens to be had. There's this private rounds and I totally understand why people do them. But like I said earlier, if you are in crypto for a while, and this is a cool thing about bull markets, I don't actually need money, I just need to pay rent. And bitcoin has gone up 50%, so I'm solid. And no one was paid anything.
00:26:59.790 - 00:27:27.958, Speaker B: There was just mango tokens that were given to people and they were told the DAO values your contributions. This is the inception of the DAO and everyone worked to build this thing. People worked without even the mango tokens and sort of the tokens were given after the fact. So I think it's a viable way to just build crypto projects.
00:27:28.006 - 00:27:51.264, Speaker A: Actually, I want more teams to try that. Totally from Genesis Dao, first approach. But it's really tough because you guys had such a principled view on how things should be done and there's a lot of people out there that are offering money for that one thing. How did you guys have the discipline to just go stick with this?
00:27:51.344 - 00:28:27.680, Speaker B: We had a lot of discussions about these things. Did we talk to VC's? And we still do. And we like all the VC's actually. So, you know, I think of like, Satoshi not trying to draw a comparison to us, to Satoshi or anything, but just there's like this beauty in that story. And I think there's, there's a lot, maybe even the majority of bitcoin's value, at least to me. You know, like, to me, I just love the narrative. I love the story of Satoshi, like, the pseudonymous founder who is like one of the richest people on the planet right now.
00:28:27.680 - 00:28:57.174, Speaker B: Obviously, there no VC's. This person wanted to not make a big fuss and not like he was kind of like this clockmaker, prophetic person. We just came and then left, built this thing and then left. And that's such an amazing story. There are these long, long payoffs. Like, they take, maybe they take a while, but they definitely do pay off that if you're not hurting for rent. Again, like, I was in a position.
00:28:57.174 - 00:29:14.314, Speaker B: All the other mango devs were in this position as well, where it was a bull market. We're not getting eviction notices or something. We could kind of float the boat for a while. Yeah. Just consider the long term payoffs. Consider the five year payoffs. Like, stories are amazing.
00:29:14.434 - 00:29:29.114, Speaker A: The weirdest thing is that, like, every good VC will tell you that you should maximize for the highest return. Like, don't worry about, like, the middle exit or don't. Don't compromise. Right. Like, actually, like, imagine you're taking over the world.
00:29:29.194 - 00:29:29.498, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:29.546 - 00:29:32.986, Speaker A: What are the steps to get there? And, like, the risks don't matter.
00:29:33.170 - 00:29:33.986, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:34.170 - 00:30:11.190, Speaker A: Like, actually maximize for the high. And, like, this is the irony here is that, like, I think this kind of fair launch, most distribution will probably result in, like, overall long term better and higher returns. But the risk that I always find is that, like, humans are hard to organize. And, like, at the same time, cryptography is this new tool for organization. Right. It is like, what allows us to, like, massively scale agreement and complex problems. Like, really, really complicated problems.
00:30:11.190 - 00:30:32.678, Speaker A: Like, we can just click a button and vote and agree on it and, you know. Right. Like, you know, that decision was made. But I'm curious, do you see, like, tension between the decentralization, kind of the disorganization of the DaO and, like, getting shit done? I gotta build stuff and like, yeah, no, 100% actually.
00:30:32.806 - 00:31:25.222, Speaker B: Like, on a daily basis, actually. And there was a podcast with the guy on Twitter who goes by austerity socks. And this was back in April, we talked about this, and he brought up a similar point. He was, yeah, this dow thing, it's all fine, dandy idea, but do you think this will work? I, to be honest with you, like, am skeptical. However, it has always felt to me sort of a high variance idea. Kind of like, if you were in the 16th century Netherlands or the 17th century Netherlands, and you were like, okay, we gotta get spices from India. How do we do it? And you come up with a joint stock corporation, and then the joint stock corporation is, like, everywhere.
00:31:25.222 - 00:32:03.580, Speaker B: And I don't think anyone's really figured out how to do daos well or, like, what's the right mix? How do we communicate? How do we coordinate all those things? I don't think anyone's quite figured it out yet. No one had figured it out, like, six months ago, and I still don't think we have figured it out, really. But if it works, like, the payoff is enormous, there is global coordination. There isn't a jurisdiction. Imagine the Dao's controlling drones. One day, it could be wild. Even taking into account all of my skepticism, I was still like, okay, yeah, we should do the Dao idea.
00:32:03.580 - 00:32:42.936, Speaker B: Not just me. Max is totally on board with this and Tyler and all the other people who build mango markets, but on a day to day basis, as of October 2021. Now, I'm thinking, okay, maybe what we need to do is have small teams that build things and then pitch it in front of the DAO and get compensation. So, like, the DAO is kind of like the government, and it subcontracts out to people. Maybe not, like, direct democracy rules everything. And we'll try that out, and if that doesn't work, we'll try something else out. But changing stuff up quickly, it's awesome.
00:32:43.000 - 00:33:05.434, Speaker A: It's actually, like, a really good strategy to incentivize product development. Build me an mvp. Which means you're the PM and the implementer, the dev, and you go deal with all the work. And, like, here. Here's, like, your management. It's all done. Just give me money.
00:33:05.434 - 00:33:06.286, Speaker A: Okay.
00:33:06.310 - 00:33:21.014, Speaker B: But, you know, and there's some, like, maintenance tasks, right? So it's not purely, like, new products. So I'm thinking of Mango V four. But also, in the meantime, there are all these nodes that need to be paid for.
00:33:21.314 - 00:33:27.426, Speaker A: I think you guys will need to split. And we called it ktol. Keeping the lights on work.
00:33:27.490 - 00:33:27.874, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:27.954 - 00:33:33.654, Speaker A: Yeah. So you have to, like, you're. For six months, you're on KTol duty.
00:33:34.114 - 00:33:34.894, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:35.354 - 00:33:45.940, Speaker A: And you get paid a salary, like, effectively, right. And you just gotta keep the lights on. But then some other folks are like, go, go build something that you can propose to the DAo and the DAO will fund it.
00:33:46.002 - 00:34:36.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's basically what we have coalesced on, is that, well, some people should be doing KTL and other people should be doing new things, building, like the new product and, well, and it takes kind of the risk out. The Dow doesn't have to pay for whatever stuff that I produce for mango v four, but we both have some kind of incentive to be honest about it. Like, if it's clearly a huge improvement or even a very substantial improvement, Dao should pay me something. Because if the DAO doesn't, then you can expect future builders to not go for it. And we have these discussions on the forums, and people make good arguments like this. I think the average iq in the mango markets forums is very high. I think probably higher than most legislative bodies.
00:34:36.714 - 00:34:49.924, Speaker B: I'm just going to go out on a limb and just say that not ours, of course. Ours is obviously very high iq smart people in our government. But, you know.
00:34:51.904 - 00:35:12.172, Speaker A: Do you believe like five years there's gonna be like a 30,000 person Dao? Like, imagine like a tech company, 30,000 engineers, or 30,000 people. Like, they got product managers, teams, layers of bullshit. Yeah. Is there gonna be a Dao that's competing with, like, a big tech company?
00:35:12.308 - 00:35:52.634, Speaker B: It's legitimately, really hard to figure out how this might look. The reason why I hesitate so much with the question of like, 30,000 personnel is I'm not sure we will have a good. I'm not sure it'll look exactly like a corporation that we can say, okay, these are these 30,000 people. You might never be able to figure out who is part of the DAO. Maybe that's like one of the benefits of the doubt. If I asked you how many people are part of Solana? Not like Solana labs, but Solana, the community. It's a little bit difficult to even answer.
00:35:52.634 - 00:36:16.308, Speaker B: Lots of people with various levels of involvement and financial. Some people have a lot of financial stake and some people don't, but some people have a lot of financial stake and no involvement at all. It's like, is wild all over the place. Like, does Solana actually, or bitcoin. Does bitcoin look like a country or a corporation? It's like I can't even put my finger on what it is.
00:36:16.396 - 00:37:36.930, Speaker A: So Eve online had like a battle that had like 8000 people all coordinating over something, right? And I think they have corporations within that game that are like, maybe probably span up to a thousand, but imagine. So that's like people organizing, using tech for a common goal without like a job, right? Without like a structure that you normally have at a company. I mean, Linux, right, was built by people organizing online. I think. I think as soon as you have something to lose, and in Linux and even line, you kind of start building up a virtual token, like your reputation as a contributor to this thing becomes a thing that we don't normally think of as valuable in monetary way, but it's valuable to that person. I definitely care about my ability to continue contributing to open source project. So where tokens I think can get there is, if there is something, a value being created by the community, some common goal that everyone's working on, then that token is in the middle of it and kind of uniting and organizing it.
00:37:36.930 - 00:37:40.986, Speaker A: I think that could scale like as large as a corporation.
00:37:41.090 - 00:38:19.014, Speaker B: No, no, I agree with you. I just think it'll always be a little bit hard to figure out how many or who's involved just by the nature of it. I just think it'll be always a little bit hard to figure out. But yeah. Will 30,000 people be building on mango or some dao? You probably know the numbers better, but we might even be approaching that with Solana. Right. So I'm like building, I'm not part of Solana Labs or affiliated with Solana anyway, but building on Solana and also have a financial incentive too.
00:38:19.014 - 00:38:33.724, Speaker B: But I also have a reputation incentive and yeah, it feels like I'm part of a. The Solana Corp or whatever it is. Right. But I don't know what it is. It doesn't even exist. It's not even a dao. There isn't even a dao there.
00:38:35.264 - 00:38:44.364, Speaker A: Oddly enough, I feel the same way about ETH and bitcoin, even. Yeah, is that like we're competing with them, right.
00:38:46.904 - 00:38:50.056, Speaker B: But it all feels like we're actually kind of part of the same team.
00:38:50.160 - 00:39:06.656, Speaker A: And this is the weird part that I think is like, gonna be really interesting how it plays out, because I don't think it's obvious to anybody. Like, what is crypto? Is it the token? Is it the coin? Is it the network? Is it the cryptography itself?
00:39:06.800 - 00:39:10.084, Speaker B: It's not the cryptography itself, so we can strike that one out.
00:39:11.384 - 00:39:28.510, Speaker A: I think it's honestly the power that a person has to be able to make these very like, concrete statements that are unbreakable. No matter how it's like, that's the math. Right. The math behind it is, like, what allows them to do that. Yeah.
00:39:28.542 - 00:40:35.564, Speaker B: So it's just, I mean, I was thinking about, like, because I don't totally know the cryptography itself. Like, I know, like, basic, you know, 101 number theory stuff, but, yeah, like the, I remember going through, like, my first programming class and coming out feeling just very powerful. I write stuff down, and then it happens. Kind of like a king, actually, more powerful than a king in a lot of ways, because I was writing these trading algorithms, and it was happening around the world in ways that probably a medieval king couldn't imagine. And then this brings, and crypto brings that to finance, where things of actual value can be moved. And you just write, mango markets exist, and you can go there and place a trade right now, but it was just somebody who wrote it. I was involved based on, you can see the GitHub contributions, but it was just people who wrote it.
00:40:35.564 - 00:40:39.884, Speaker B: That's probably. Yeah, we can maybe chalk that up to the cryptography.
00:40:39.964 - 00:40:41.584, Speaker A: So what's next for you guys?
00:40:42.044 - 00:42:02.910, Speaker B: There's drones on the horizon? Yeah, sometime in the future, but we have to do a lot of the nitty gritty, roll up your sleeves kind of work on Solana. So far, there isn't maybe, like, a lot of projects are struggling with this, like, indexing all the data and providing it for people in a usable way, because there's just so many transactions and so many, you know, turns out if transaction fees are really low, people just make a lot of transactions and they don't think about it. And so gathering it up and displaying it in a useful format to people, that's like, very immediate term, and then slightly medium term is sort of becoming the place where everyone does leverage trading and does borrow in lending all the crypto natives. And then, of course, in the long term, I always say this like, somebody like my mom should be able to store her money in mango markets and not think twice about it. It's not a good idea right now, I wouldn't say. But that's the goal, where, like, that involves a lot more social things than just technological things. That's like, get it to a level where she can do it safely and feel comfortable and manage her keys, or even if she's not managing her keys, have a solution for how the keys might be managed, that she's not falling for scams.
00:42:02.910 - 00:42:05.526, Speaker B: And that's, I would say, my long term goal.
00:42:05.590 - 00:42:27.884, Speaker A: It's awesome, man. Yeah. On that note, man, really awesome to have you on the podcast. Great conversation. I'm always always excited about what you guys are doing and how the community is building this, like, ecosystem of its own. So really amazing. Like, it's serendipity that you guys turned building on, Solana.
00:42:27.884 - 00:42:31.196, Speaker A: Just really lucky to have folks like you in the ecosystem.
00:42:31.300 - 00:42:34.444, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks a lot. That means a lot. Yeah, this was really fun.
