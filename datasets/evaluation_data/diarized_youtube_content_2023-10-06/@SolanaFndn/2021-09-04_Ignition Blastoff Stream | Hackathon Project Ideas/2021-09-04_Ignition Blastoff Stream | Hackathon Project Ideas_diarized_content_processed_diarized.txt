00:00:14.480 - 00:00:41.502, Speaker A: And here we go. Okay. Hi, everyone. Welcome. We are doing our first kickoff event of the Solana ignition Hackathon. We're going to be running these all throughout the event until October 8. We'll have presentations from VC's and CEO's of leading companies.
00:00:41.502 - 00:01:10.114, Speaker A: We'll have more technical workshops for developers that want to know how to build on Solana or any of the companies sponsoring the event. Today, though, we have Anatoly, the CEO of Solana Labs, and then Kyle Simani, one of the managing partners and co founders of Multicoan Capital. So, yeah, welcome to. Welcome to the stream.
00:01:11.974 - 00:01:14.394, Speaker B: Hey, guys. Hey, everyone.
00:01:15.894 - 00:01:16.874, Speaker C: Hey, guys.
00:01:17.894 - 00:01:18.582, Speaker A: Cool.
00:01:18.718 - 00:01:21.314, Speaker C: 07:00 a.m. So happy to be here.
00:01:21.854 - 00:01:57.104, Speaker A: Yep, yep. It's early for us, a little later for Kyle, who's in Germany, but yeah, today we're just going to have a discussion on, you know, potential hackathon project ideas. We just kind of want to pick your guys brain and see what you want to see built during the event. So I guess, I guess the first question is we can, we can kind of COVID maybe previous hackathons and you guys can give your experience on like, what you guys really liked coming out of those and why you liked it from a project perspective. So, um, yeah. Anatoly, do you want to start first?
00:01:57.884 - 00:01:58.372, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:58.428 - 00:02:39.126, Speaker C: So, um, you know, I definitely really like the, um, the really deep technical defi projects that took the time to innovate on top of serum. Really figure out if there's an opportunity to build another financial money Lego that leverages the central limit order book. Um, it's complicated and it's hard, right. And you got to kind of figure out where those innovations lie and where the advantages lie dealing with this complex system. But that's the future. Finance. These message heavy central limit order books are the best version of price discovery that we have and that we know.
00:02:39.126 - 00:03:14.534, Speaker C: And if you start thinking about building products on top of that now, I think it's the perfect time to see if there's an edge and figure out if there's a way to innovate. But that's the boring stuff. I love everything that's really consumer oriented, too. If you find any clever way to get people on board and go do anything with cryptography, I think that's a huge accomplishment. So two sides to this coin. Go deep technical or figure out, is there something that humans actually want?
00:03:18.614 - 00:04:02.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I'll add color. So I think the first couple of hackathons, I think there's been three now, and they've been pretty defi heavy, and that's been awesome. And you're kind of seeing like, all the major primitives kind of being built out, serum, kind of a foundation, and then you've got people doing an iridium saber, psyoptions, mango zeta, and all these different things. Right. And so I feel like there's a lot of momentum now on kind of the core defi primitives on Solana. So I think some of the things I'm really looking forward to are, at least in terms of defi, is people trying new ways to build some of these product primitives. I think the most obvious example here is look at the borrow lend protocols on Ethereum compound and aave are more or less the same product.
00:04:02.922 - 00:04:40.374, Speaker B: Like, there's very few differences in the core products. And like, Euler Finance just announced the fundraising a few days ago, and they're really the first team that's building a lot of new advanced types of features around the core borrow lend primitive. I think that's super cool. In Solana, I think you can take some of those same ideas and extend them further and say, okay, we have basic borrow lend pools with a utilization rate and based on utilization, but start to get more advanced and complicated in those different structures. So I'm very excited to see developers use Solana's power and flexibility to build things that aren't even possible today.
00:04:42.274 - 00:05:09.054, Speaker A: Yeah, nice. And what do you. I mean, I think a lot of the DeFi primitives, whether it's borrow lend or amms or order book exchanges or margin trading, all of that, those primitives have kind of already been built out in the DeFi space. What are some primitives maybe in like gaming or web3 or other verticals that you want to kind of see built out, that we'll kind of like spur that later in innovation and later on.
00:05:10.354 - 00:06:23.954, Speaker C: So, like, I think, examples of how to build, like, very simple primitives that are common across games. I think you see some of this with loot where it's really nothing, right? It's just a metadata. But having it standardized in a format that works across a genre of games that has a lot of different permutations and different styles and can be reused is something that I think is the key metaverse building block. And I'm starting to think of it in terms of deFi, where people start figuring out what is a token, what is the ERC 20 interface and so forth. How do you then do the same thing for transfers of assets and attributes like identity between games and those kind of primitives as well? Something between interfaces and document formats is the challenge there. So if you got that, you wrote a lot of character sheets for dungeons and dragons, this is the perfect time to start building smart contracts.
00:06:29.434 - 00:06:38.574, Speaker A: Nice. What do you think, Kyle? What kind of fundamental primitives do you want to see built out that haven't been yet on Solana?
00:06:43.714 - 00:07:18.878, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I don't know a ton about gaming. I don't fall too much anymore. But I think, for example, look at Stardust. They're making it really easy to build a marketplace to buy and sell in items in game. My intuition is there's quite a few things to do above and beyond that. Looking at NFT fractionalization, looking at repackaging things, looking at ways to take metadata and kind of combine it and recombine it, I really, there's a lot of opportunity in all of those things.
00:07:18.878 - 00:08:07.464, Speaker B: Just as an example. So if you look at the people 5000 days NFT, that obviously can be split into 5000 pieces, but it's not even just that. It could be split into 5000 pieces, each of which is not fungible. And I feel like there's a really interesting design space around kind of social coordination games around people combining pieces of data to form some sort of like higher collective beauty or something. I think loot is kind of dabbling with a lot of these ideas today and I think you can, there's a lot more cool stuff you can do about and beyond that. So we'd really love to see teams who are kind of playing in that design space.
00:08:09.164 - 00:08:44.070, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, no, I agree. I think, yeah, one, I think you mentioned just like one really basic one that I love to see built, which is just fractionalization of nfts just to, you know, enable a lot more liquid markets and. Yeah, I think it would also like spread out the ability and access for people to buy these things. They're getting pretty expensive and so, you know, forming daos and collectives and stuff and having them being lower priced due to fractionalization would be really cool. Cool. And so let's see.
00:08:44.070 - 00:09:06.074, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess there's been quite a boom in like generative nfts on Solana recently. Maybe what are some like tools or add ons or infrastructure that you'd like to see kind of around that or different takes on the generative NRT projects that you think would be a good hackathon project this time around.
00:09:08.734 - 00:10:15.584, Speaker C: On the finance side, the floor perpetual was pretty cool. I think it's not quite ready. I think the design has water, see bugs in it, but if you try it I think you might be able to figure out how to make it work and that would be super cool. I think on the tooling, there's a couple auction mechanics that I think might be super cool to apply to nfts, and this shouldn't be a lot of work. You can take the mango idea source code and apply it to an NFT drop with 1000 items and do the same setup where there's 24 hours to deposit, 24 hours to withdraw. And that creates, I think, a lot of the social impact around the intensity of the demand for those items, which I think really drives a lot of the narrative and is a really good story for artists to jump off if they've done a really big drop. But also is, it feels like a really fair mechanism for price discovery in those initial drops.
00:10:15.584 - 00:10:27.384, Speaker C: So that's something that I think can definitely be accomplished in a week or two. And you should be spending most of your time building a really nice UI for it.
00:10:30.164 - 00:10:54.104, Speaker B: Yeah, there you go. I find generative art to be super interesting. I kind of love the idea that math can produce beauty. I think that's like a. I love that. So you've always talked about like, the VDF and history is like, you have math and code time. And I also love that, like, math encode beauty, which I think is super cool, both audio and visual.
00:10:54.104 - 00:11:39.304, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I think the most interesting design space or design, I think vector for generative art that is still mostly untapped is the notion of time itself. So I've heard a couple tweets, norms about this in the last few weeks. But for example, you can have an NFT where the input into the NFT is like some piece of entropy, like the merkel root of the current block or whatever. And like, therefore, every time you look at the NFT, it's different. Or maybe that's too much entropy. You just need not time. And it like, is slowly evolving and moving, you know, like every 4 hours or every 12 hours or whatever, based on time.
00:11:39.304 - 00:12:22.944, Speaker B: But I think there's a really interesting opportunity to create generative art that incorporates time as an input into, into the algorithm itself. And then, of course, if you do that, then you can also that that piece of art produces more nfts over time, right? Because like any snapshot of the. That it produces at any point in time, you could turn that into an NFT. So it's an NFT that produces an infinite number of nfts, which I think is super cool. I also think there's a really interesting opportunity to kind of do that with creators as well. Today you're seeing creators issue nfts. And sometimes it's like random celebrities, sometimes it's a piece of art, sometimes it's tied to music or whatever.
00:12:22.944 - 00:13:07.730, Speaker B: But it feels to me like you should be able to chain nfts together that have some sort of like, related significance. So the simple example I would use here is, let's say you're like a tick tock influencer and you're like, passion is, I don't know, like saving me, like climate change stuff. Let's say you have like a million followers on TikTok. You know, if you post the video and tell everyone, hey, guys, if you create an NFT or, sorry, I'm going to do a series of five videos and I'm going to issue an NFT for each one. And if you own that NFT, you can be in the next video. So you sell the first NFT whenever someone is in the video, and then that video is the second NFT for the next person. And so now you have this chain of five NFTs that are all like related to each other.
00:13:07.730 - 00:13:38.454, Speaker B: Right. I just think there's a really interesting design space here to incorporate the notion of time into these things because I think that really memorialized, like a big part of NFTs is just memorializing an event. And so, like, you look at like, pleasure Dao. They bought the uniswap v three thing when that launched in like May or whatever, right? That was like memorializing the v three launch. And I think this is a really interesting way to kind of build on the notion of memorializing some important moment in time.
00:13:41.394 - 00:14:04.618, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool. Yeah, no, that sounds awesome. If the team wants to tackle, tackle any of those ideas, that would be great. Let's see. Yeah, maybe I'll just open it up. We have about 20 or so minutes left. I'll open it up to just like random ideas.
00:14:04.618 - 00:14:12.994, Speaker A: You guys want to see bad NfT land? Really? Anything you guys think.
00:14:16.934 - 00:14:19.474, Speaker C: You dropped for a second, Matt. So I missed that.
00:14:19.974 - 00:14:21.342, Speaker B: Oh, sorry.
00:14:21.478 - 00:14:31.114, Speaker A: I was just saying I was opening up the kind of floor for you guys to talk about and jam on. Any ideas that you want to see build on the hackathon. Yeah. Across any of the verticals.
00:14:34.054 - 00:15:24.124, Speaker C: Gaming, I think is the right one to start figuring out. You know, star Atlas, I think was, had like really tremendous success on its kind of launch. But it's AAAA game that's going to take a while to build. And I think there's opportunity for people that can focus on like small mini games and start experimenting with play to earn mechanics. But also. Right, like can you actually build some of these data structures that are shareable across the genre? Right. If you start shipping a bunch of minigames that are, you know, Castlevania, side scroller, item collector, whatever, you can start figuring out what those patterns are that are composable within a true blockchain, cryptocurrency, first gaming ecosystem.
00:15:24.124 - 00:15:39.684, Speaker C: So folks that are looking to experiment there, I think that would be awesome to see somebody that creates three the simplest mini games that are different but share the same smart contract data structure. That would blow my mind, basically.
00:15:43.384 - 00:16:29.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a ton of opportunity around that. And then also like making things more interoperable between games. And so like, I mean look, the blockchain is there and any game can use it. But like, one of the things that's really challenging is if you own an asset in Game A, just having a render in game B is like it kind of forces both games to have the same visual style, which is like not necessarily ideal. Like maybe you want to have different visual styles for different types of games, almost like an interface layer. Maybe this is almost like IPLd or that may be the wrong concept. Or you can kind of map a single asset to multiple visualizations and front ends for different types of artistic styles.
00:16:29.410 - 00:16:45.954, Speaker B: That way you can like take an item with you across multiple games and have that notion of shared ownership, but not be visually an eyesore as you move between environments. I think there's a ton of opportunity for game interoperability and. Yeah, just, just really cool design spaces there.
00:16:48.614 - 00:17:25.934, Speaker A: Cool. How about in defi? I know the ecosystem is growing really fast. There's a lot of different kind of experiments running right now. Um, is there anything you think, uh, that's, you know, fundamentally missing? Um, anything. Like one thing I'd love to see more of is as more kind of, you know, individual borrow protocols come out, individual amms and um, and uh, and Dex has come online. Like, I would love to see more aggregators. Um, I think those have been super successful in Ethereum.
00:17:25.934 - 00:17:34.063, Speaker A: I think thats going to be successful in Solana too. So what are some maybe areas in defi you guys want to see expanded on?
00:17:36.283 - 00:18:22.212, Speaker C: Yeah, aggregators for sure. I think amm style liquidity pools, where liquidity providers deposit funds. I think thats one of the key innovations of the Amm. And I think that is actually more of the innovation than the constant function market maker. And I think the right way to approach it on salon serum is to start basically automating the market maker portion using the serum order book. Just start using the book as your function, and you can run cranks and proxies that automatically move the LP's assets around the spread. That's being managed by all these amazing liquidity providers like Alameda and jump and stuff like that.
00:18:22.212 - 00:19:35.024, Speaker C: And you basically built v three without any other work. This is uniswap v six, and you're using the best minds in finance to manage the bugs for your LP's. So just stuff like that. I think it's pretty simple to roll out and should be fairly simple to build on Solana and serum. And then on top of this, if you're thinking about borrow lending and liquidations, Armani has done some work to and some of the folks, I think from the jump teams are starting to build out the hooks to serum to be able to pass around obligations between trades. So if you're a finance person and you're listening to this, it should tell you that it's then possible to use that same infra for arbitrary financial instruments, options, futures, perpetuals, whatever, and still use the same book. Obviously, it's going to be trading different pairs, right? But you can start using the same infra and start having those market makers plug into that in a really straightforward way.
00:19:40.644 - 00:20:22.764, Speaker B: I've been thinking a lot about defi derivatives. That's kind of the area I'm most excited about. And I think the kind of base idea is, like, to get to something that looks like decentralized FTX, and there's like, a couple of ways to get there. One way, make all of the different EV protocols composed with each other. So, for example, like, if you have an option, like psy option, being able to use a mango perp or bonfida perp, or drift perpendicular as collateral in that. And, like, each of those three perks are, like, different, right? Like, they're not the same. Like, those perks aren't perfectly fungible because they have different liquidation requirements and a few other small details.
00:20:22.764 - 00:21:03.484, Speaker B: So finding a way to make all of the various collaterals, like, from the different systems interoperate with each other is super cool. And there's like a big, big opportunity there. Then the other related thing is building a front end that handles all of this. Mango and Monfita are doing this now, but I think there's a real opportunity, but they're all doing it just for their own protocols. Building a front end that automatically gets execution and moves between all these things. And, for example, lets you trade out your spot assets, but still manage the same global collateral engine, even if you have different derivatives. Outstanding.
00:21:03.484 - 00:21:08.324, Speaker B: Um, making all that work across the back end of the front end, I think it's like a massive, massive opportunity.
00:21:11.904 - 00:21:17.984, Speaker A: Yep, yep. Um, I feel like a lot of these pieces are, are there, like, you can.
00:21:18.104 - 00:21:18.360, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:18.392 - 00:21:25.000, Speaker A: Can you, can you hear us, Kyle? Sorry.
00:21:25.112 - 00:21:25.808, Speaker B: Yep.
00:21:25.976 - 00:21:50.184, Speaker A: All right, cool. Um, yeah, I think a lot of those pieces are there. Like you mentioned, psyoptions you can plug into them. Mango you can plug in there. And so just like combining them all together, making them composable is going to be super key. Another thing that's happened recently is we've had the first set of oracle providers come online. So that's Pif.
00:21:50.184 - 00:22:01.084, Speaker A: Chainlink is now on Devnet. What are maybe some use cases that developers can, can utilize those tools for in their hackathon projects?
00:22:06.584 - 00:22:07.484, Speaker B: Totally.
00:22:11.104 - 00:23:15.204, Speaker C: Tools. Oracles are like one of those tools. I think there's like prediction market tools that could be built. I think some of those are data sources. Some of those are, there's a couple libraries that are half built in the Solana program library, repo, for using oracles to trigger prediction market results. The slickest implementation of this would be to take the governance framework and an oracle and then like use the governance framework for repudia, like, you know, reputation and of the, of the data and potentially like disputes, and then have those options service the prediction market. The pieces are there, just no one has combined them and said, hey, we're going to build this prediction market framework on Solana and this is how it's going to look.
00:23:15.204 - 00:23:52.774, Speaker C: Um, like, again, right? Like, these are like, some of the tools that are missing. The, the tools are there. It's just that the combining them into a product, I think is the missing part. Um, I don't know what, what we need that's totally missing right now. Like, that's a huge hole from Ethereum. Um, if you're like purely interested in just making the developer experience better, just start playing around with anchor. And there's a ton of like little devx improvements that would totally help.
00:23:52.774 - 00:24:11.394, Speaker C: And that's maybe like a, not the sexiest project. Right. It doesn't have like a product and you're not going to get funding for it. But I think, like, looking for awesome people to contribute and there's tons of grants for that stuff anyways.
00:24:12.494 - 00:24:13.274, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:15.614 - 00:25:09.572, Speaker B: One thing I've been thinking about is making it really easy to feed arbitrary data into smart contracts. If you look at chain link today, and I'm less familiar with pith. And there's another one on Solana squat leaderboards, switchboard. Switchboard and maybe some other ones as well. I forget off the top of my head, I would really like to see someone make it trivial that you can add your own data source to pith or switchboard or chain link, self serve basically, and then upload your own data feed on some cadence, whether it's hourly, whether it's one time. But if you can make that dumb simple for anyone in the world to do, I think you really open up the door for the long tail of prediction markets. And I think that's really interesting.
00:25:09.572 - 00:25:30.684, Speaker B: If you let anyone be able to send Oracle data to the chain for anything, then you allow anyone to create any market for anything. I think that's a really, really big opportunity. And again, building out the entire product space around that in terms of user interfaces and everything else to make that all work I think is super, super cool.
00:25:32.744 - 00:26:18.764, Speaker A: Yep. One area I'd love to see people tackle a little bit more that's obviously huge in the traditional financial industry. And maybe we have a little discussion of if this was even needed in the first place. But like insurance products, given the nature of blockchains, them being somewhat trustless and transactions being atomic, I'm curious, do you think insurance is something that's really needed right now in crypto? I know there's been some attempts on Ethereum with Nexus mutual and such. Just wanted to get your guys thoughts on this piece and if people should be, you know, focusing projects there.
00:26:22.184 - 00:27:35.604, Speaker C: It depends. If you have like some really deep technical insight, there's you know, latest and greatest and compiler research can get you to actually do like a lot of like algebraic analysis that's super computationally heavy on smart contracts and their inputs. If you can do that, I think that makes sense. Like you can actually simulate very large, like surface, that very large surface area, you know, with a bunch of GPU's and arbitrary programs these days, that makes sense to me. Like, I think purely like economic based insurance models, I feel like without like some insight into what the hell is going on in the contract are ripe for, I think mispricing the risk like that, that's really like, I think kind of the problem, like with insurance, you got to be really specific about what kind of risk factors you're insuring against and you need to have some alpha in identifying them. Otherwise it's like a crapshoot, you know, put your money in an NFT drop as a hedge instead. But that's my personal opinion.
00:27:35.604 - 00:27:39.924, Speaker C: If you got conviction about insurance. Go for it, man.
00:27:41.744 - 00:28:46.030, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think we've debated insurance a fair bit internally and at one point we have one of our analysts look into all the major insurance protocols on Ethereum. We didn't invest in any, but we had kind of a few takeaways from that that I'm happy to share here. So I think the first is that like if you're going to do insurance, don't just copy nexus mutual or there's like two or three other ones on Ethereum, maybe four other ones. I think that's very high probability that the wrong way to do it. I think the most interesting ideas around insurance are tying the insurance to the auditor themselves, where the auditors audit something and they have some tools, like for example, what Anatoly just described, and then they put over the money where their mouth is and they say we will insure these contracts. And then I think you put a token in there somehow. But fundamentally tying the security analysis part to the insurance makes sense now, legally.
00:28:46.030 - 00:29:40.514, Speaker B: I know there's some legal challenges here, but I just think that design space is super, super interesting and it kind of feels correct to me to tie those things together. I think the other interesting thing, important thing to note is just the fundamental challenge with insurance is that margins trend towards, towards zero because these systems are deterministic. Today if you look at Uniswap, for example, no one is ensuring their Uniswap TVL because just everyone has such high confidence. There's no bugs or look at compound and a year curve. The percentage of dollars in those systems that is being insured is actually decreasing over time because people just feel like they're safe. So it's just a tough market for that reason. Right? Like real insurance works because like people get sick and like they crash, they like text and drive and like they crash their cars and whatever.
00:29:40.514 - 00:29:51.314, Speaker B: But here it's just, it's like a strictly deterministic environment. There is some interesting design space for insurance, but we haven't yet found the thing we love.
00:29:53.694 - 00:29:54.474, Speaker A: Cool.
00:29:57.294 - 00:30:46.984, Speaker C: Yeah, like I could see somebody be successful if it's like new project is being launched on you know like smart contract, right. That, that has like this is their first audit. Nothing's proven either. You do like simulation analysis and you ensure for specific hacks, right. And that could be pretty interesting like for, for users. But I imagine like Kyle said, that after a while, if the contract proves out to be bug free, you end up with needing less and less of it. The counter to that though is that things like when you get to more complex systems, central and motor books like perps, everything else, it's just the surface area of a business.
00:30:46.984 - 00:31:12.964, Speaker C: Logic is so large that the devs are going to always ship v two, V three, V four. When is that going to end? Mango shipped v three. It's a team that's three months old. Basically release a new version every one to two months. If we're at a stage in crypto where iterative development is the norm, probably insurance might make sense.
00:31:16.064 - 00:31:40.894, Speaker A: Cool. And then just some general advice, maybe for people building projects in the hackathon and know this is not financial advice or anything like that, but when do you incorporate a token into your project? What are the parameters that you think are right for that and think it would be a good fit?
00:31:42.514 - 00:32:38.660, Speaker C: A lot of people shit on this token thing, but I think it's important to just start from the start, assuming that there's going to be a token, because that's what really crypto is all about. It's about this thing that unites a community around development effort, the open source projects and everything else. And the stuff that you see fail are the 19 out of 20 where that just doesn't make sense. And those products didn't make sense in crypto to begin with. So that could be a really good filter function. If you can't, if there is no way to define how this is all tied together on the token, it maybe is not like the right time for that in crypto today. And counter example to this, people have figured out how to do NFT drops with 1000 items, no tokens or whatever.
00:32:38.660 - 00:33:21.194, Speaker C: So there's other mechanics in crypto that I think are very core crypto. The core proposition there is this community building around a thing that's cryptographically shared state between users. There's ways to simulate those things without a token, but I feel like they need to be there. So start early in terms of legal fundraise, etcetera, or releasing the token. Those are complex questions based on every team's unique position with funding, where the jurisdiction, et cetera. Those are going to be very, very team specific.
00:33:23.494 - 00:33:49.178, Speaker A: Well, I think Kyle. Yeah, dropped off, dropped, dropped off. Not sure what happened. Let me take a look at the chat and see if there's anything people are wanting to get answered. No offense, but it feels like Kyle repeats a ton of what Anatoly says. Lol.
00:33:49.326 - 00:33:50.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:53.514 - 00:33:59.614, Speaker A: Any ideas in web3 that you're super keen on seeing builds?
00:34:00.674 - 00:35:20.144, Speaker C: You know, like we've been like wrecking my brain. How do we apply like social media. Like, how do we take, like, web two pieces and rebuild them in web3? And it always ended up feeling like I'm trying to, like, make bricks out of concrete where you're looking at some Web two experience and you're like, well, what if instead of a Google Oauth login, it was a wallet or something like that? It just doesn't quite capture that true crypto ness of what makes any of these projects unique and what makes it worthwhile for somebody to spend the time to get custody of a key and actually go use this product. The alternatives between Reddit with a seed phrase versus Reddit with a login is just Reddit with a login. And it's hella easier to use that. You got to build something that is really unique and interesting and forces people to actually take that step, that hurdle to self custody. So what does that look like? These are, I think, where people should start kind of thinking of innovating and maybe that start is something simple.
00:35:20.144 - 00:36:02.084, Speaker C: But, yeah, if you're thinking about web3, I wouldn't look to web two. I think what I've seen that's been really interesting in Crypto is that the Cope community is on Discord, but it's a social network. You know, like the DJNapes Academy is on discord and on Twitter, but it's a bunch of nfts that's a social network, right. That have clear representation that you're in the network when you own one of these things. So we're kind of building web3 on top of web two as a communication layer, and I don't think we need to bring web two into web3.
00:36:07.484 - 00:36:11.944, Speaker B: Sorry about that. I dropped my Internet kind of dropped for a second. What was the question, Matt? Sorry.
00:36:12.324 - 00:36:25.304, Speaker A: Yeah, we can go back to the original question, which was like, when to incorporate a token into your project. I think we get that question a lot. Yeah. Any thoughts on that would be appreciated.
00:36:25.884 - 00:36:57.424, Speaker B: Yeah. So generally don't do it too early. Like, probably shouldn't be releasing a token, like during hackathon. There could be an exception, but quite unlikely. There's two way. I think in most cases, you don't want to launch token until there's a product that works. I think that's the most general rule, having a token that's out there that people are just like, oh, yeah, someone will ship something one day.
00:36:57.424 - 00:37:32.106, Speaker B: It's just, it creates a lot of pressure on you, actually, as the people who created the thing, because then everyone's going to keep asking you, hey, when's the product launch, when's product launching, you know, and, like, you know, inevitably there's delays. Like, things happen. It's software development. So, you know, I think, don't put yourself in that, in that situation. Get some feedback and make sure people are using it. And then the second thing I would say is, know why you're issuing a token. Tokens are superpowers if they are used correctly, but they need to be used correctly.
00:37:32.106 - 00:38:16.454, Speaker B: So, like, my favorite example is compound, and they really pioneered. This is, you know, they said, look, like, this is an open protocol. Someone needs to govern the system. Like, what's the, what kinds of collateral go in here and what are the utilization ratios and all that stuff? And they said, look, we're not going to govern that, and the community needs to govern this. And they had to come up with a way to give people the token, and they said, oh, well, we should give it to some lenders and some borrowers. That was a very intuitive way to do it and turns out to have been extremely smart. I would just say once you're going to create a token, know why you're creating it, right? And make sure you're clear about that, your intention and your purpose.
00:38:18.434 - 00:38:35.370, Speaker A: Cool. It's good advice. All right, so we're almost at 45 minutes here. Kyle's got a run. He's got to go visit another castle in Germany so we can wrap it up here. But, yeah, if you. Thanks for watching us today.
00:38:35.370 - 00:38:54.012, Speaker A: If you haven't registered yet, please do so@solana.com. Ignition. Yeah, submissions are due on October 8, and we're going to be running more of these twitch stream sessions as time goes on. So thanks, everyone. Thanks Kyle and Anatoly for joining. And, yeah, good luck.
00:38:54.148 - 00:39:23.154, Speaker C: Yeah, just to quickly add, if you think that I'm wrong, Kyle's wrong, that's almost like the perfect signal to go build that thing, because you're probably right. It's like, outsiders with conviction that have a vision are like, the most, you know, they have the highest kind of returns in their investment when they get it right. So 100%, you know, like, just go for it. Whatever you really believe should be using crypto, that's the right thing to build.
00:39:24.174 - 00:39:43.534, Speaker B: Plus, one could not agree more. I love it when people tell me you're wrong for reasons x, y, and z. Those are the most fun conversations. So, yeah, guys, hey, you all have so much fun. Build some amazing stuff. If you have any questions, dm me on Twitter. I'm sure you can probably dm Anatolia as well, or the Solana team and can't wait to see what everyone builds.
00:39:44.394 - 00:39:46.234, Speaker A: All right, thanks, guys. Bye. Thanks.
