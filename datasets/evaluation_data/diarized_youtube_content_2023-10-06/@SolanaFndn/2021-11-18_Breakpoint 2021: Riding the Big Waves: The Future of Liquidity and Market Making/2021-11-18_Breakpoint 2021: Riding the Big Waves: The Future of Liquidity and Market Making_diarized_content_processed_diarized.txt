00:00:22.320 - 00:00:42.194, Speaker A: Hey, guys, thanks for being here. We know that's the final day. Everyone's probably quite exhausted. So great to have all you guys joining us for this panel on liquidity and market making. My name is David Liu. I'm a co founder at Drift Labs. We're building a decentralized drift is protocol on Solana right now primarily focused on perpetuals.
00:00:42.194 - 00:00:55.300, Speaker A: So you may have heard my colleague Cindy earlier on stage, and I guess without further ado, pass it on to Jacob to kick off the short 22nd introduction before we dive into the meat of today's discussion. Cheers.
00:00:55.372 - 00:01:05.824, Speaker B: So, I'm Jacob with GSR. We're a market maker and liquidity provider in digital assets, both on chain and off chain.
00:01:06.764 - 00:01:21.314, Speaker C: Hey, I'm Simon Nursey. I work for QCP. We are a digital asset service provider. I run the derivatives trading. We're market makers in options across a wide range of venues and to our customer base.
00:01:21.974 - 00:01:33.150, Speaker D: I'm Joe. I work at CMS holdings. We operate a little bit as a hybrid fund between actively traded strategies and then venture investments over there. I help head up our investment portfolio and.
00:01:33.182 - 00:01:45.114, Speaker E: Good afternoon, my name is Yuri. I work at Anchorage Digital. We're a platform for institutions that securely custody, trade, and do a lot of on chain activities for digital assets.
00:01:45.874 - 00:01:46.258, Speaker B: Great.
00:01:46.306 - 00:02:19.568, Speaker A: Thank you, gentlemen. So I think what we'll start off with is talking about the breakdown between centralized market making on centralized platforms, as well as decentralized platforms. Especially over the past year, year and a half, we've seen this massive inflow into DeFi. So I thought it might be worthwhile to start from a market commentary perspective, get the panelists thoughts on what that transition has been like for them. We've got some options market makers here as well. So perhaps, Simon, siding with you on just some of the things you've observed in the space, and then we can pass it around.
00:02:19.696 - 00:03:14.276, Speaker C: Simon? Sure. Yeah. So for us, we've been quite taken aback by the shift of the explosion in the DeFi options space. We always felt it was a difficult problem to solve, getting derivatives on chain, but now it's not experimental or a test or anything like that is a very significant part of our business. We're turning over about $250 million a week of Defi crypto options through the various vault projects out there. And this is up from zero just a matter of months ago. So we're very bullish the sector, and it's clear to us it's not about the, it's all about the customer experience.
00:03:14.276 - 00:03:36.744, Speaker C: It's just a nice, easy process. Connect to wallet and trade, and we're seeing a lot of customers moving over to that who don't want to go through all of the painful process of where are you located, what's your doing, all the KYC and things. This is a super exciting area for us and we're all in.
00:03:37.254 - 00:03:42.014, Speaker A: So Jacob, how about yourself? GSl, also in options quite heavily. I'd love to hear from you too.
00:03:42.174 - 00:04:35.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I think generally we try to be agnostic versus prices discovered on centralized exchanges or in decentralized exchanges or venues. The decentralized space is much more capital inefficient at this time. It requires a lot of more capital, but the yield is quite a lot higher. Some of the innovations that we are seeing now is basically weeks to weeks, months to months, on how in the decentralized space is becoming much and much more efficient. So I think we're going to see tons of more liquidity moving that way, and we're going to see an even faster rise in decentralized derivatives and options. So I agree with Simon.
00:04:35.252 - 00:04:52.464, Speaker A: Got it. And I guess, Joe, I'll pass it over to you. And we talked about capital inefficiencies, thinking we're seeing a lot of that and a lot of this is being mirrored in the amount of insane yields that we see on all these platforms, these derivative protocols such as DYDX as well. From both your perspective and CMS, how do you guys see this opportunity?
00:04:52.764 - 00:05:31.364, Speaker D: Yeah, so for us, I think right now we run quite a bit of automated strategies on things like DyDx and perpetual protocol. But what's been interesting to us is, I guess the capital efficiency kind of leads the funding rates on these platforms to get out of whack a little bit faster than you see on a centralized exchange. So from the trading perspective, we're looking to take funding rate arbitrage, trades most of the time between decentralized exchanges and the centralized exchanges. I think as we see liquidity kind of continue to get into this space that'll start to dry up. But right now that's kind of what we're focused on between kind of automated Dex trading and then our bread and butter on the centralized exchanges.
00:05:31.784 - 00:05:37.256, Speaker A: Got it for you, Yuri. How about what's your position in for Anchorage as well on this market?
00:05:37.360 - 00:06:16.980, Speaker E: So Anchorage is in a very unique place in the crypto industry, where we are a federally chartered bank in the United States. So what does this mean? So like, you know, if we look at options, for example, that we started talking about, options are reasonably new in the crypto space. Obviously, there's always been OTC options. But then a couple years ago, we saw the CME list options. Now there's all these option platforms in the DeFi space. And as an institutional facing platform, we get a lot of interest from all sorts of clients, especially ones that are coming in from the traditional finance space of their options. Interest.
00:06:16.980 - 00:06:41.424, Speaker E: Right. So there's a lot of work that Anchorage is doing in the regulatory front to allow clients to start trading here. Maybe it starts with something simple like the NFA CFTC registration so we can do CME options and then also do a lot of work on how to approach from a regulatory perspective, things like Simon and Jacob talked about as far as options and DeFi platforms and more of the OTC space.
00:06:42.484 - 00:07:11.354, Speaker A: All right, so I think, Joe, I want to hone in on one thing you talked about, you know, the funding rate basis, basis arbitrage, which is quite significant. And I think this is where this whole intersection of C five and DeFi seem to overlap. You know, it's very easy to go one position, say long run perpetual protocol, and take the hedge on FTX. So without obviously revealing too much alpha, is that what's brought you guys into the space as initially traditional play in this?
00:07:11.754 - 00:07:49.304, Speaker D: Yeah, well, I mean, I think we play kind of across the entirety of the platforms. Right. So, I mean, we'll provide liquidity as well as trade on things as well. I mean, I think for us, we're kind of just after wherever the opportunity lies. So, I mean, right now we're finding a lot of arbitrage opportunities there. I think we would like to trade a bit more standardized what we do on the centralized exchanges, but I think we're waiting for a little bit more institutional participation, just a little bit more liquidity, kind of backing the framework of what we have right now before things get there. So, I mean, I think it's opportunistic, but it'll definitely change in the future.
00:07:49.804 - 00:08:27.598, Speaker A: Got it. And then let's hope. I mean, this is a good segue to, I guess, capital efficiency, which inefficiency, rather, which is what Jacob talked about earlier. It seems like partially there's a chicken and egg problem, I suppose. Right. When is the liquidity going to arrive? Before we even step into that? What's the experience been like to even set up strategies, even to get involved in defi in the first place? Because we discussed this sort of earlier, but there's usually some barriers to entry, even, say, moving from l one has its own challenges, and then moving from l one to l two has its own set of limitations, which you don't really get on a centralized platform. So Jacob, perhaps you can start there.
00:08:27.726 - 00:09:35.614, Speaker B: Yeah, I think looking at the arbitrage opportunities just initially you have two different price discovery mechanisms. You have the constant product formula on decentralized exchanges, and you have a central limit order booked. So that's a pretty natural space for price differences to occur. And that becomes a natural attraction for an arbitrary to go in and r between dexs and zexs. Now, the initial entry to the decentralized space is that instead of having an account, you now have a wallet. Instead of doing trades, you're now doing transactions. And if you're a fairly, I guess, sort of established firm where you need to have all the control, backstop controls within your organization like we do, you need to be able to synthesize transactions as trades and recognize wallets as accounts, and then you need to integrate on quite a lot of decentralized sensors is still very fragmented, and we don't really have this interoperability yet.
00:09:35.614 - 00:09:52.254, Speaker B: So there's tons of work and prioritizations to go after these different pools, but the opportunity is certainly there and we're seeing less fragmentations, more interoperability coming. So I think generally it's the place to be at the moment. In DeFi.
00:09:55.414 - 00:10:53.006, Speaker C: As we see it, the problem of the sort of primary markets is solved right through vaults, and there's a lot of vault solutions out there at the moment. It makes it very easy, the process of putting money in, taking money out. And as a market maker, it's very straightforward getting involved in that and extending liquidity there. The challenges as a market maker is then being able to move into the secondary markets and provide two way consistent streaming markets all the time. And for that we need leverage. We need risk aggregation and leverage, risk aggregation and efficiency of trading, and we're not there yet. It's definitely more capital efficient to trade on the CFI exchanges, but all of the components are definitely there.
00:10:53.006 - 00:11:19.010, Speaker C: And we've met numerous projects in the last few months that are putting the bits and pieces together right here. We've got friction Psi options, all producing, looking at very good solutions for this. So I'm quite sure that it's just around the corner in terms of a full order book based DeFi. And then I think the shift of liquidity will happen very, very quickly, I guess.
00:11:19.042 - 00:11:47.474, Speaker A: Yuri, anything else on? I guess you talked about regulatory, a lot of structural challenge, and I think that a lot of funds and larger organizations these days struggle with that. I mean, I had a conversation with a large market maker, and that person requested KYC pools in order to market make on a platform like ours. And I guess that's obviously a structural limitation for you guys. Have you seen that to be a blocker to entry into the defi space?
00:11:47.974 - 00:12:22.424, Speaker E: Yeah. Obviously, the KYC is first and foremost. That is by far the most important thing for a lot of the customers that we talk with. Obviously, I think a lot of the crypto native funds are very comfortable right now with what KYC AML looks like in the crypto space. For example, our customers face anchorage. And if Anchorage decides to source liquidity and defi, most crypto natives are okay with that. But when you're looking at folks that are coming more from a traditional finance space, they obviously dig a lot deeper.
00:12:22.424 - 00:13:08.360, Speaker E: I don't think that the majority of them are quite comfortable with a lot of the Defi exposure, although a lot of strides have been made over the last, I would say, year. Right. But right now, I think, for example. Well, let me give an example here. A lot of the traditional finance folks, they want to use bitcoin that they hold, you know, for a long term timeline to like, for example, go open interest on futures. Right. But, you know, they deal with, you know, futures commission merchants, which are under the CFTC umbrella, and there's no regulation that says, all right, well, you can have bitcoin as underlying collateral, so you can use a platform like Anchorage to place your bitcoin in.
00:13:08.360 - 00:13:32.322, Speaker E: And then we cross margin us dollars, which an FCM can take, and then the client can actually through two steps away, you know, use their bitcoin to go short and long futures. So for now, we were seeing it just like in that regulatory framework. So not quite there on the DeFi space. But I think, you know, if we have the same conversation, I'm answering the same question, next year, I think the answer is going to be quite different.
00:13:32.458 - 00:13:54.426, Speaker A: No, absolutely. So I think this probably takes us to the next part of the conversation. I want to unpack in a bit more. A lot of this growth in DeFi has absolutely skyrocketed the past two years. I remember trading options, actually OTC back in 2019, and that was the only way to do that. This was even before Darabit was even really capital efficient. And that in itself had its own challenges.
00:13:54.426 - 00:14:29.602, Speaker A: Fast forward two years, so much has happened to the point where a decentralized exchange like DyDX can overtake coinbase in the amount of volume done in a day. So in terms of that migration of liquidity, not just for DyDX, but for other platforms, how has that informed a lot of perhaps your thinking around the evolution of these defi exchanges? And I think we can start on derivatives, just seems to be that derivatives capture a lot more volume spot. Simon Pap, starting with you, given you sort of alluded to the options piece very early on, Simon, you know I'm.
00:14:29.618 - 00:15:02.520, Speaker C: An options guy, right? Yeah, we're still. I mean, so DyDX has been a massive eye opener for us. The success of the platform and how quickly liquidity has moved on to it is incredible. And even this, we know, is not an ideal solution. Level two, blah, blah, blah. You know, there's. But it's clearly set the path for where liquidity is going to move and how it's going to set up.
00:15:02.520 - 00:16:16.806, Speaker C: I actually see a world in which we have liquidity going in two different pools. We've got the regulated Coinbase style us, sort of liquidity pools, FTX, etcetera, and then this less regulated direct access DeFi world of liquidity pools. And I think there'll be, we'll see increasing divergence between the two sides. You know, if you look at a lot of the exchanges that are sort of under attack right now from regulators, or rather being challenged by regulators right now, it's clear that a lot of the customers that are now struggling to reach those exchanges will divert themselves to Defi and consider crypto options are currently unavailable in a regulated format to half the world's population. This is the sort of solution that DeFi brings in. But it's a separate world of liquidity to this other exciting area, which is the whole regulated world and traditional finance entering and taking advantage of these assets.
00:16:16.990 - 00:16:23.634, Speaker A: Jake, for you, do you see something similar where there's going to be almost distinct pools to serve different customer groups?
00:16:25.974 - 00:17:42.914, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I still think there will be centralized and decentralized liquidity for a long period of time. What I'd say about the derivative space within decentralized finance, inherently yield farming is inherently unsustainable in the long term in its current form, and liquidity mining is also fairly unsustainable. Quite interesting innovations going on where you actually have sort of protocol owned controlled liquidity, rather than user owned liquidity where you put on and you get it back. But what derivatives and options do on decentralized finance is that it's provide a sustainable yield. So instead of having yield farming as well, traditionally we can look at the inherent volatility of the asset class itself, and we can create yield from that. And I think people will more and more migrate to that sort of long term sustainable yields? So that's quite exciting to be able to provide that in a decentralized ways because it's already quite big on the centralized exchanges.
00:17:48.194 - 00:18:32.764, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I guess from our side, we probably share a similar opinion where we see a world, at least in the near future, where there's these KYC regulated pools, and then there's also your typical decentralized what have you that we're using now. I think for us, we hope this isn't the future that we kind of trend to, just because you kind of end up in a similar scenario that you see right now, where you kind of have the big boys all in one place, and there's a lot deeper liquidity over here. And then retail is kind of playing on their own little playground. And I think for us, from an idealist perspective, all this stuff kind of unifies into, I don't know, a lot more of a wholesome kind of liquidity front than kind of just a different type of fractured liquidity than we're seeing right now.
00:18:35.144 - 00:18:35.920, Speaker A: Sorry, go on.
00:18:35.992 - 00:19:11.054, Speaker E: Yeah, just one more aspect to kind of look at, to answer this question is security. Right. So at Anchorage, you know, security of your assets is probably the most important thing that we do. Right. When you look at a DeFi platform, do I want to place a $50,000 trade there through some sort of a metamask wallet? Sure, no problem. But if you have a big institutional client and they want to do a $10 million trade, maybe accessing a DeFi platform, even though the execution may or may not be better, we look at it from a security perspective. Probably not going to put $10 million of clients money onto a metamask.
00:19:11.054 - 00:19:27.374, Speaker E: There's also these types of considerations as well, especially when you're dealing with an institutional client that has done a ton of DD on you, due diligence on you for security purposes. So there's also those considerations that I think are going to be fixed over time as well.
00:19:29.594 - 00:20:08.040, Speaker A: Got it. So it sounds like there is a question around even just access pointing right now. We're all using on chain wallets to interact. I think Jake talked about transactions. Let's quickly move on to, I guess, even the, I guess, the whole constant product curve piece that we talk about, the amms, it's very much like a defi native piece that you've seen, and it's widely popularized by Uniswap. Then x x times Y equals k. Naturally, that's quite different to just the pulse central limit order book type model starting perhaps quite high and then moving down.
00:20:08.040 - 00:20:16.124, Speaker A: Very curious to get your thoughts on the evolution of these very defi native type systems. So, Jacob, have starting with you.
00:20:18.264 - 00:21:14.356, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm not a huge fan of the constant product function because price only moves when you trade. And it's in traditional finance, in the central even order book, you can, you know, move your quotes around and price change that time is much more smooth price discovery process. But there's been some limitations across sort of speed and cost on l one s, which has led amms to look like they do what we're seeing with things like Dydx and a lot of the sort of l two innovations into bringing central limit order book type quoting into defi, I think is fantastic. I think that's a, you know, that's big for someone like, for someone like us. And we're leaning into that space quite.
00:21:14.380 - 00:21:18.564, Speaker A: A lot, I guess, like unpacking that just says, sorry, no, go on.
00:21:18.724 - 00:21:55.344, Speaker C: I take personal offense at Amms. I've been market making for 20 years. And to sort of reduce your job down to x times Y equals z is a bit of an upfront. Right. We know that market making is difficult. A good market maker is able to anticipate flow, measure liquidity, get a touch on who's doing what, and use that in order to make the tightest price possible, you know, to provide the best liquidity to the market. I don't think a formula can do that.
00:21:55.344 - 00:22:30.302, Speaker C: I know that market making is easy. Right. And I've seen that in my 20 odd years. Profitable market making is very difficult. And I think the, and I think the trick with amms is that the, is that you're getting other people to pay for the liquidity or the losses that you're providing through your liquidity. And then there's a little bit of smoke and mirrors to conceal them. So I do not see amms as a sustainable, long term means of providing liquidity to the market.
00:22:30.302 - 00:22:43.114, Speaker C: I think there's a, there is a, to really maximize liquidity in the market, you do need active risk taking participants that are, that are injecting. And we've got a very real role around this.
00:22:44.894 - 00:23:11.590, Speaker A: This is wonderful. We want this kind of like diploma dissonance, contrarian opinions, because I know that there's a lot of amm maxis out there that seem to think, oh, no, and to be frank, I'm shooting myself in the foot because we run a virtualized amm model on drift that has the exact same challenges. It's like for you to exit your position, there needs to be someone who takes your position, and only then can you sort of get the exit liquidity and that. Joe, sort of nodding. So your thoughts as well on this? I know we've had a chat separately about this, too.
00:23:11.702 - 00:24:00.778, Speaker D: Yeah, well, I think, I guess I would say we see it that amms might serve their purpose, maybe for smaller things. You want to do a quick swap for a new token you saw, or this or that. Maybe it's a little bit more of a retail centric thing when you start getting into trading derivatives and stuff like that. And I believe it's similar to what you're doing. You can have the virtual Amm with maybe an actual spot amm behind that kind of backs it, because what we've seen, being one of the larger traders on perpetual protocol, is that when the market moves, it's a lot of retail driven folks on the platform, and they're all trading the same way. So what you get is kind of this lack of liquidity for somebody to come in and take the other side of the position, because the entire market's going one way and it kind of just leads to this whole mess of liquidations when things come back the other side. So I think we've been happy with how things are so far, but I think there's room for improvements.
00:24:00.778 - 00:24:07.944, Speaker D: I don't think we'll see it go away completely, but it's definitely going to, I think, evolve a bit, bit more from what we've seen so far.
00:24:09.964 - 00:24:37.848, Speaker E: Yeah, I think I would just add that the crypto markets are just iterative in general. Right. So the Amm formula and that type of trading is still very new. Right. It's like the first iteration, and we were talking in the back room a little bit about, you know, virtual amms, which are kind of, you know, a concept built on top of the amm itself. Right. And there's also a big education gap, too, right, from the traditional markets.
00:24:37.848 - 00:25:12.502, Speaker E: Everyone is very familiar with central limit order books and the whole order book structure and the two triangles, the green and reds that you see on exchanges, that's what pretty much everybody knows from bonds, derivatives, equities, and in crypto, we have these new concepts. Do they work? Maybe in some cases. In some cases not. If you see Citadel Virtudo, that would never work in an amm because it just moves too quickly. There's just not enough infrastructure, I guess, built out around that. So, yeah, definitely very good points made by, I think, both sides here, and.
00:25:12.518 - 00:25:37.324, Speaker A: I guess, touching on central limit order books. We're starting to see l two s, even Solana, for instance, project CRM Dydx, which we discussed earlier, being able to really handle some serious volume now and sort of coming full circle. Is infrastructure perhaps a big contributing factor for you all getting involved into defi? Simon, perhaps starting with you.
00:25:37.624 - 00:25:57.054, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So many challenges are solved with the right infrastructure in place, and I think I've been super encouraged by what we've seen in the last three days. I think that. I think we see some pretty rapid progress now. It's looking quite forward to it.
00:25:59.954 - 00:26:46.740, Speaker D: I can talk from our side a little bit more maybe on the hardware infrastructure than on chain. So for a lot of our decentralized trading strategies, we have developers committed to either running nodes on whatever network it might be on, or just kind of monitoring the thing the whole day. I think perpetual protocol, again, might be a good example. Running our own XDai nodes and being able to track everything that's coming through, it gets a little bit tougher on Solana. That one's definitely been quite a haul right now. So, I mean, given the transaction speed that's going through, it's quite hard to kind of look back on everything that happened unless you're running your own nodes or have access to an archive node as well. So kind of getting all that stuff in place, and I guess for us, it's a lot of proprietary software and work on top is kind of just been like a little bit limiting to the scale right now.
00:26:46.740 - 00:27:06.464, Speaker D: So I think we're kind of seeing that across the board, too. I mean, a lot of firms kind of have their feet wet, at least, excuse me, at least the crypto native firms. But I think everybody's kind of getting ramped up and getting a little bit more familiar with how this stuff works. And once everyone's kind of got their feet in the ground there, I think we'll see things ramp up quite a bit more on the trading front.
00:27:06.924 - 00:27:26.304, Speaker A: Got it. And I guess in the time that we have left, I think something perhaps maybe more broad philosophical is in a firm like GSI. I know you guys have gotten very active into Defi, particularly over the last year, year and a half. I mean, in sort of the future for you guys. Is that, is Defi here to stay for you guys? And will you guys get more and more active in this space as we grow?
00:27:27.364 - 00:28:00.604, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're going to continue to be more and more active, I think, about 2020, 5% of our liquidity. So a bit over a billion per day is run through DeFi today. I think that's going to continue to grow for our partners that we work with. What's really exciting for them is, you know, composability is super, super important. There's great work being built, being done that that's very exciting for us. Bridge financing is a great opportunity. It takes a long time to move between l two s to l one s.
00:28:00.604 - 00:28:22.564, Speaker B: There's a lot of stuff being built out, which is very, very important, where we'd love to provide liquidity and help our partners having more capital efficiency in defi, super important, as well as the derivatives and options space. So that's really where we're, where we're focusing from a GSR perspective for QCP.
00:28:22.864 - 00:28:36.304, Speaker A: Biggest options market makers, arguably, you guys are doing a lot of work with, I think, some of the, I think, ethereum protocols like ribbon finance as well, and a few other projects. What's the future for you guys?
00:28:36.924 - 00:29:12.024, Speaker C: Oh, look, we go wherever our customers go and where they want us, right? We naturally seek points of highest liquidity, but also the points where the highest demand is, and make sure that we're participating in all those markets, taking advantage of whatever flows and themes there are. So we're just, our strategy is basically around keeping everything open and being able to chase the market wherever it goes next, which is challenging itself.
00:29:13.484 - 00:29:29.794, Speaker A: It's incredibly dynamic and I think it's evolving so quickly, even on just like a daily. I think we also see things in weekly epochs, almost like stuff just moves so, so fast. And I mean, as we wrap up, Joe, yourself and I guess how you see this evolving the space.
00:29:30.694 - 00:29:54.502, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, for CMS, like, we'll just continue to look to get involved in any way we can. I mean, we kind of participate across the board right now, whether it's on the trading side or some of the decentralized lenders. We're kind of just looking to be one of the firms that can help kind of bootstrap these things out the gate and be early users ourselves, since we're so familiar with it already. So I think we just kind of keep our eye on what's out next. And CMS will probably be involved in one way or another.
00:29:54.678 - 00:29:56.710, Speaker A: Absolutely. And Yuri, to wrap it up.
00:29:56.822 - 00:30:28.414, Speaker E: Yeah, I would say that right now, the traditional finance firms that are coming into Anchorage, they've basically been greenlit to hold bitcoin, Ethereum. Right. That's where the biggest asset managers that are regulated in the United States, that those are the assets that they're basically allowed to hold. So what Anchorage is trying to do right now is to figure out how they can leverage those assets in order to use them as collateral with all sorts of different derivative platforms that are available to them out there. So we're trying to just build out the infrastructure for traditional finance firms to do that.
00:30:28.754 - 00:30:29.138, Speaker B: Great.
00:30:29.186 - 00:30:36.618, Speaker A: I think that's time for us. Everyone, thank you again so much for tuning in on the afternoon of the final day. Please give it up for our panelists today. Thank you.
00:30:36.706 - 00:30:40.844, Speaker E: Thank you. This.
