00:00:02.480 - 00:00:02.920, Speaker A: Alrighty.
00:00:02.934 - 00:00:27.958, Speaker B: And we are live. Welcome. Welcome, everyone, to the third event of the Solana wormhole hackathon. We have an incredibly exciting fireside chat today between Stani Kolachov and Anatoly Yankovnko. Stani is the founder and CEO of Aave. Anatoly is the co founder and CEO of Solana. So this is gonna be a 30, 30 minutes conversation.
00:00:27.958 - 00:01:10.656, Speaker B: It may go over a little bit longer, but it'll be similarly formatted. How we did the first one, where we're just going to have a nice long conversation about origin of Aave avogaches, Aave version two, and a few other exciting things. And so, for everyone that's watching, I posted a link to the hackathon page in the chat. This evening at 11:59 p.m. PST is the final closure for registration. Hacking will commence tomorrow, and we're at just about a thousand applicants, so we're excited to have everyone join us for the warm call hackathon. And I think, I think with that, totally, I'm going to hand it over to you and let you take it away.
00:01:10.720 - 00:01:30.936, Speaker A: Have fun. Cool. Hey. Hey, man, it's awesome to have you here. I feel like lending has been one of those really hard to crack problems. You guys have done a remarkable job moving it forward. So kind of like, I don't know.
00:01:30.936 - 00:01:35.844, Speaker A: I'd love to hear, like, how you, how you even ended up in this problem and the origins of Aave.
00:01:37.144 - 00:02:58.360, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I actually didn't, didn't, like, understand in the first place, like, how. How to do landing on chain, I mean, with the, with the pseudo animus nature, with the blockchain. And it's kind of funny because pretty much, let's say if you lend to someone else and you don't have any idea who that person is, you probably will not see your money ever again. So I tried to figure out back in the days how we could make a loan transaction where the counterparty, the borrower, has an incentive to repay the loan. And pretty much we came up with the model of over collateralized lending that was back in the days where Eatland existed. And what was interesting then is that all of the assets, so many things. What I'm now looking at, for example, what is happening in Solana and the, what this hackathon is all about, practically getting new ideas out and building the ecosystem, basically, it's exactly what I saw way back ago.
00:02:58.360 - 00:03:44.782, Speaker C: In the earlier days of Ethereum and Defi. There was interesting things such as, for example, many of these assets that we used as a collateral, they actually had very, very low liquidity. So I mean, besides, let's say, ethereum. Ethereum you could use, I mean, it's more used as an asset. And kind of like, we started with this like a clunky peer to peer model. Let's say one person comes, puts a loan request, you know, and then someone else comes and funds that, and then that person takes the risk of that particular collateral so that there wasn't any idea of any kind of like, pool models that we have today. So, like, there was more risk involved.
00:03:44.782 - 00:04:57.398, Speaker C: So in that sense, like, lending was very difficult to start off in the very beginning, but as, like, liquidity started to pile up with things like with Kyber and uniswap and of course, like more liquid ERC 20s actually, it become more usable product and you could create money markets where people deposit and just earn and can withdraw at any time. So lending probably is like one of the difficult things to build on in defi. And that's just because of the risk. Like, there's so many different types of risks and they actualize when something, you know, bad happens. And it doesn't need to necessarily be in crypto. It could just be COVID, it could be the within, you know, a few days with, with the elections and everything, you know, if, you know, the result might not be what people expect or, you know, that might affect the stock market, it might affect the cryptocurrency market, and then the collateral positions cascade. And then kind of like, that is a real, like a battle testing of your protocol.
00:04:57.398 - 00:05:01.524, Speaker C: And that is why, like, lending is very complicated.
00:05:03.864 - 00:05:40.304, Speaker A: So I think, like, there's kind of an interesting evolution. I think you guys went from peer to peer lending to almost implementing a margin risk engine for Ethereum, which is like, to me, like, kind of blows my mind, right, that those are the same thing. Did you guys, did you have that realization like, that this is like margin, but this is like, actually like a trading, like more trading oriented than, like, me borrowing it money from you for like a car or something like that.
00:05:41.724 - 00:06:54.380, Speaker C: I think with the colorization, it's, it's a bit of something that is the nature of it. But like, of course it's not the same as, you know, like going, going and, you know, buying a car and, you know, then, like, without having any kind of like a collateral or let's say, like, like an asset as a collateral. Because, like, some ways I think that, you know, when you put your name on the table and you put your reputation that is in one way, collateral as well. But I mean, everything started just as a small project a few years ago, so I never expected to go this far, honestly. Like, even with the AAve protocol launched this beginning of this year, like, we expected like few million worth of value locked in the protocol and we were already thinking like how we will basically build the version two and, you know, that will be our, like, thing. Like, we will have so many cool features and, you know, like, and just like default started to take off and, you know, and, you know, flash launch and everything. So it surprised us quite, quite well and.
00:06:54.380 - 00:07:04.184, Speaker C: But I happy it happened. I mean, you know, being here for a while, I mean, it's really nice to see some good traction.
00:07:05.404 - 00:07:50.134, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. It's good to see like this time around in the cycle that, like really hard working teams that have been added for a while getting traction. I think, to me, this has basically been the biggest kind of proving point for the space is that it's no longer based on just a white paper and some hype. It's actually, here's a product and it works and it's actually useful and that's driving it. And this to me feels more like a start to bigger and better things. I saw this really cool thing on Twitter, which to me seemed awesome. Like, could you, could you like, describe that like a bit?
00:07:50.794 - 00:09:09.008, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, the gotcha is a project where practically you have this visual non fungible tokens and you have basically collectibles, visual collectibles in the form of ghost. And they're pretty cool. You can get those ghosts by kind of like having this ghost token, and you can buy portals and each portal has different kinds of ghosts, and you have this kind of like rarity farming going on. But to actually unlock those ghosts, you need to do certain actions, and one of those actions is pretty much based on earnings on Aave, which practically means that the better you are at saving funds, so not spending, but saving, the quicker you unlock your aavegotchi. And once you unlock your aavegotty, there is basically consumables and then there's wearables. And this is pretty cool because you can equip your aavegotchi and you can also basically feed your aavegotchi.
00:09:09.008 - 00:10:20.270, Speaker C: So there's different kinds of interesting stuff. And the idea here is kind of like combine a bit the NFTs with Defi and also kind of bring more compatibility into the, not just the Defi ecosystem by connecting this, but also kind of like with abagotchi kind of like kickstart a bit more of this like compatibility in the NFT world. So I could imagine the future, let's say someone else could create a new kind of a challenge or new kind of a game and use those other gotchas there. And by the way, this project is not actually made by the AaVE team, it's basically made by a project which is in the AavE ecosystem. And they just loved what we were doing. They were hacking in completely different thing during one of the hackathons in this year and then they basically decided to work on the NFTs and they're very passionate about it. And this is interesting because Abagogy was like a one project in the Abe ecosystem and they recently did a daiko.
00:10:20.270 - 00:10:52.550, Speaker C: So it's kind of like a Daos and ICos bundled together where you have actually instant governance for the token holders. And basically they actually raised, I think, ten or 12 million. And it's just surrealistic because it's one project in our ecosystem and we're super small as well, so it's just insane. And six months ago, just hacking in a hackathon, that's awesome.
00:10:52.702 - 00:11:45.518, Speaker A: That's really good to see that kind of like crazy progress. I love this idea of building on top of protocols. And I think to me this is revolutionary in the sense old school communication was based on copper wire. From you to me, around the world, literally voltage, pass, like connected voltage, and like people came up with packet switching where they digitally stored the information and then forward it and that transformed like the Internet. That's basically what the Internet is based on. And to me, like blockchain is a way for us to do that with money and programs. And it's not just like open source code, it's literally here's like a protocol that I no longer like, have to maintain and code on, right? And anybody can use.
00:11:45.518 - 00:11:58.864, Speaker A: And all that work that I've done is now like stored and like reusable by other people. It's kind of mind blowing, I think, the amount of human scale this can accomplish. You know, like, to me this seems like very transformational.
00:11:59.804 - 00:12:56.734, Speaker C: I think it's, it's fascinating because like imagine like how many smart contracts they're already deployed and whatever you're building. Like, you can interact with everything there, you know, and if you connect with different blockchains, you know, and pass the data from one place to another, like it's, it's just, it's impossible to compete. It's really, really impossible to compete. And Defi is funny. Because you look at, let's say traditional banks or, you know, traditional finance and how, how it's structured today with their software, their technology and settlement networks. When you have something like this, which is practically Internet of smart contracts, you cannot put reverse at all. Your only choice as a financial institution would have to be to join the network somehow.
00:12:56.734 - 00:13:55.332, Speaker C: Practically the banks become the front ends of the protocols. That's pretty interesting. Sure there's regulatory questions and still like lot of things to solve in terms of privacy and so forth, but I think we'll get there. But just the power of having this Internet of smart contract is pretty epic. And not just defi, but I could imagine you could build any kind of application like aavegotchi. It's practically not actually defi, it's more of gamification and, you know, basically collectibles, but they use deFi. I could imagine that they will be using something else, incentivizing some other kind of behavior, you know, students learning even on off chain and putting results on chain and that way getting basically unlocking their collectibles.
00:13:55.332 - 00:13:59.024, Speaker C: So it's mind blowing what's coming up, to be honest.
00:14:01.084 - 00:14:19.424, Speaker A: Do you think that like we will get to a point where we have reliable reputation on chain? Like a lot of people have been working hard and solving and cracking the snot and no one I think has yet. Do you think that there's, that's viable or are we always going to be stuck in this over collateralized world?
00:14:20.164 - 00:15:46.754, Speaker C: Yeah, it's, I think, like somehow, like somehow I feel it's all available, but somehow I feel no, no one like have done it properly. I don't know, maybe people get tired of like trying because like projects and, you know, they do it for a year or two and you know, like putting the credit score into the blockchain and, you know, like now we have honor collateral loans and then you don't hear from the projects for a while and, you know, but I think you can connect things, you know, I mean, you could create some sort of like even reputation based in the beginning, like, let's say if I don't repay a debt, you know, you know, that data could go publicly, maybe not that harsh, but you could definitely connect in different ways. And I think like the missing piece is some sort of like a enforceability because you still need to enforce stuff in off chain. I mean, even if you are optimistic and think that most of the transactions will not end up in disputes, which is practically what happens in the real world, right? So you have in every agreement dispute resolution clause, but it never usually activates. It's like, like small portion of disputes are, I mean contracts, financial transactions.
00:15:46.834 - 00:15:51.054, Speaker A: The optimistic roll up dispute will probably never trigger, right?
00:15:51.634 - 00:16:52.876, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean it might not, but it also might. I mean there's always the risk though. And yeah, I could imagine that. I think a project that could somehow connect this to worlds in the sense that not to be too ambitious, but just creating some simple way of enforcing agreements. And I think we have done it a bit with the credit delegation in the sense that you could delegate your credit as a depositor in aave to someone you trust and you wrap it up with this open law legal agreement. So it's basically you go there, you sign an agreement, put the Ethereum addresses, click a button with metamask and it deploys, deploys the smart contract infrastructure, that is with the legal agreement. And on the agreement you already know the counterparty, so you could actually sue him.
00:16:52.876 - 00:17:05.902, Speaker C: But if you don't know, that's a different story. So there's some stuff you could already do and it's actually happening. But scale, I don't know, it seems people are.
00:17:05.958 - 00:17:46.446, Speaker A: That's really cool. That's really cool. I didn't know about this, but that sounds like kind of an amazing first step at it. Yeah, because I think a large part of these systems is kind of like scaling, like scaling what is typically like a very long and painful process in the real world, which is like applying for credit or getting a mortgage or anything like that. It just takes like days and the wires take days and everything just sucks. Right. And it's expensive and there's a lot of middlemen involved.
00:17:46.446 - 00:18:17.754, Speaker A: And if you can eliminate that, but even still have like a signature. Right, that's fine. But that's like, I think a huge way to like take it from, you know, you and I having to spend like two days to do it, to like it taking two minutes. And then 100 million people could potentially lend to a dollar to a startup in San Francisco that needs that funding or something like that. To me the possibilities are kind of awesome and crazy.
00:18:18.454 - 00:19:41.504, Speaker C: Yeah. I think also we complicate things a lot. I mean in real life there is many things that, you know, are somehow simplified in the sense that, let's say if you have like disputes, there is agreements, you know, this so called like New York convention that if you, if you get a, you know, arbitration kind of like award, you could enforce it in like 180 countries with that one single kind of like reward or like award, like a judgment and you know, I think we just overcomplicate things. You know, we try to solve every person's problems like in one kind of like user flow and that's where things like break, you know, I think those projects that are now looking into like connecting the credit score in real life and making like the kind of like lending facility, you should pick one type of user flow. Let's say something very simple that serves one particular purpose. And this is what happens in DeFi as well. If you see things that will be built on this hackathon or in general they solve one particular economical function, you don't need to build everything in the same protocol.
00:19:43.044 - 00:20:46.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I, that's kind of like speaks well to me, like just kind of as a software engineer, I kind of grew up in the Linux Unix world where you wanted to build very small programs that did one thing and you piped them together, right. That kind of composability was like beautiful to learn as like an early engineer to kind of finally understand that you don't have to do everything in one giant program, but like things can be simple and those simple things like are easier to test. And I see this in Defi now and it's kind of really cool to watch. Do you think the lending side of it is going to be. To me lending seems like a very useful tool that is just part of finance in everyday life. And that to me seems like almost bigger opportunity than just like any, like, like layer ones and on their own. Right.
00:20:46.810 - 00:21:07.254, Speaker A: Like it's connecting people with capital to other people that need that need it. Do you guys see like it being tied to any single chain? Like, I mean, I understand Ethereum has this tremendous kind of like ecosystem and mo right now that's really hard to break. But I don't, I think the use case itself is bigger than ethereum in my mind.
00:21:07.934 - 00:22:23.626, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think like many of the use cases will be bigger than ethereum because I mean, or any other change because it's like these changes are bringing security. But many of the use cases are actually kind of like a, bigger than that. Of course, depends how you, how you calculate. But if you calculate in terms of like, let's say capital allocation, if the networks are secured by capital as well, and I believe finance in general is bigger than one particular network, securing it. And that might be even problematic. I mean if you have a, you know, like a, you're securing something that might even have more value and this kind of situations might, might even happen and kind of like, I think also it's a problem. Like if you, if you have application in one particular network compared, if you could actually spread that and diversify the networks that you have the liquidity.
00:22:23.626 - 00:23:59.488, Speaker C: And also I think that different kinds of networks, they will provide different kinds of value for different finance, different lending especially. And I just think if it goes that more and more lending instruments will be in DeFi, or I even see that many use cases where liquidity is pulled from DeFi with, for example, with credit delegation. It's a way for traditional financial institutions draw basically stable coins with a legal agreement from, let's say there could be a dao that accepts who could be a borrower from credit delegations and who could actually draw those credit lines. And if you can get, let's say, stable coins at one, one and a half percent from DeFi compared, raising bonds or taking private placements at higher rate, that is a good source of liquidity. And you could take that liquidity, convert it to fiat, and actually use it in traditional finance. And someone might actually use partly defi source liquidity in buying property or house or whatnot. So I think, like, and if you have this demand taking out of Defi, you know, there will be supply because it pressures the rates, which means that more liquidity will go into Defi and the lending facilities.
00:23:59.488 - 00:24:38.494, Speaker C: And what happens is actually that you have this like a positive cycle where you have this global liquidity pools on different kinds of networks which are sucking liquidity, and then traditional finance is sucking it out there, you know, and that that will be like a magnitude where we will see that maybe actually lending will be a very big thing if the liquidity will sort, will be sourced from Defi. So the answer is yes. So I think. I think so I'm.
00:24:40.214 - 00:25:44.364, Speaker A: The other part that's kind of been fascinating for me to watch is this like weird kind of fight between capital efficiency, right? Like, because with over collateralized loans, actually, if you deposit a bunch of assets into Aave, but also the fact that a lot of these operations are tokenized themselves, that instead of just kind of like putting my money in a bank, I put money into something that gives me that, a wrapper token that represents my deposit there, which is in itself fungible and is in itself capital, right? Like, yeah, how do you like, it's hard to understand, like, the implications of this, but to me, it seems like we're building something that is actually is capital efficient because all these tokens are tradable in value. We just need bigger marketplaces. We haven't scaled the marketplaces to support this massive amount of long tail of assets to cross.
00:25:45.424 - 00:26:48.658, Speaker C: Yeah, I think this tokenization of various positions, it brings more efficiency, especially when we think about over collateralized lending. For sure there isn't, there's a challenge that practically, in the sense that, you know, you have to put more capital. I mean, you're putting your loan position at stake, but also, I mean, if you deposit, you know, you get this, let's say now, but you get this, a tokens and it's practically claimable for the underlying in that sense. And you know, you could deposit the a token to someone else. I mean there was like one hackathon project that did this kind of like a yield curve. So you deposit eight tokens into another contract and then you mean another token, and then you sell that token to someone else at a discount. And then practically you earn still from your a tokens until the maturity.
00:26:48.658 - 00:27:48.474, Speaker C: But then the sole token, you got basic liquidity, and then you can take that liquidity and put it someone else. You know, it's like an ongoing circle of efficiency that you can optimize and the challenge is like how much you can optimize. Because there's two things that I'm worried about. One is the systemic smart contract risk, in the sense that when we have so many layers of smart contracts, they do operate. But if something is found in those smart contracts, bugs or economical exploitable scenarios, that's very risky. And also the fact that when we have this tokenization and unwinding from those positions might be tricky as well. Because when you deposit into Aave, for example, that's kind of like the base layer for liquidity.
00:27:48.474 - 00:28:29.634, Speaker C: And that basically means that if you have a borrow position and you don't have enough value, it might be liquidated. And all this cascading positions, this is something I worry on a daily basis because I personally, when I look at, let's say, defi pulse, and I see that there's 1112 billion worth of value, and I'm thinking like, what will happen if there will be something big? And you know how much of it is recursive? Yeah. So it's also like, it's a value loop. We call it a value loop.
00:28:30.374 - 00:29:13.884, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's scary. But also this happens in the real world and it is impenetrable to us to like the smartest people in the world. Engineers cannot understand how this stuff works in finance because it is wrapped in so much like legalists and like tribal knowledge and like hidden. Right? Like, it seems like those banks don't want us to know this. But now this is open and we can actually Monte Carlo simulation and then see where, like, what are the, what are the painful, like, where is this stuff like actually fall over? Like, I think that that's kind of like the huge advantage of building in the, of open finance.
00:29:14.184 - 00:30:47.934, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I think that what I like about defi that kind of like keeps me like, you know, enthusiastic is that, that you can't see everything, you know, like in the sense that there is so much transparency. And this transparency means that all the contracts, all the transactions are auditable by anyone. In one way, we kind of lose a lot of privacy in the sense that even though these transactions are pseudo anonymous, they're still attributable to people. And you could kind of like connect the dots that it's an issue. But as a default, having this kind of like a transparency in public blockchains, it really brings value and it makes an environment where you have to think before you do a transaction in Ethereum because it will be actual history book. People can go back years from now and look in the back that, oh, this, this kind of stuff happen, you know, and analyze stuff, which is good, but in the sense that when you look at traditional finance and you can't see anything, you know, you, and if we, if you, if you are a regulator and you look at different kinds of books and settlement networks, there's a way of like, there's different accounting rules and they bring a lot of flexibility.
00:30:47.934 - 00:31:27.134, Speaker C: But in Defi, everything has to settle in a, in a specific way. And there is like quite narrow rules. I mean, you know, with, with everything, you know, block size and so forth. So I think public blockchains are very good as default. And privacy is something that should be added, though, of course. But this is what, what difference from the traditional finance. And I think this is also why maybe Defi will not be ever like a, kind of like a, it won't, it might not get a bad stigma.
00:31:27.134 - 00:31:48.264, Speaker C: And I think the same thing with, let's say, even bitcoin. I mean, there used to be the narrative that criminals use bitcoin. It's very difficult to make that argument these days. And, you know, public transactions compared to, let's say, completely private points and, you know, they can't get rid of that stigma.
00:31:49.764 - 00:32:30.320, Speaker A: Yep. I think for Defi specifically, I think the openness of it is a huge advantage. Part of the reason, like why I was so focused on trading with Solano is just like my experience, trying to trade on like, you know, I wasn't like, trading a lot, just like a little bit, you know, but I never had enough data, and all this data was, like, opaque and hidden, you know, like, you can never really get, like, the data that, like, CME has or New York stock Exchange because they want to charge you a lot for it. And even to pay them, you have to, like, pass a lot of hoops. Right. Which is unfair. Right.
00:32:30.320 - 00:32:43.038, Speaker A: It's just unfair. Right? Like, I don't know how else to call it. It seems like very insidery. And, like, having, having these open markets, I think, is a way to equalize the world in a lot of ways.
00:32:43.206 - 00:34:00.504, Speaker C: And I think it brings new ideas because let's say if there's traders trading on Solana and there is high frequency trading going on, they have all the data, they can analyze it and basically make more efficient strategies. Or if it's not even trading, it might be just another kind of transactions. You could look some patterns and see, okay, this could be, like, I see this happening all the time, and maybe this could be improved by creating a smart contract that does some particular function. So definitely I'm also eager to see what in this hackathon will actually, what kind of applications there will be, because it's kind of, we're in unique position in the sense that you could actually hack something. You know, you can create pretty interesting applications and you can have speed. And I'm really curious to see what kind of things people come up with because this hasn't happened quite often, or maybe I've been, like, completely, like, not aware of, but basically, like, it's a different scale.
00:34:02.724 - 00:34:41.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm pretty excited, too. I don't know if you saw that, like, serum folks published the swap, the projectseerium.com, which is a pretty fast implementation of a token swap. And it looks and feels like a centralized application, like a AWS hosted app, which is. It's, like, boring. It's almost boring, right? Like, okay, I don't have to, like, wait, you know, minutes for something to happen. So in a lot of ways, like, I'm excited about the boring stuff because it, like, normalizes the space.
00:34:41.220 - 00:35:11.413, Speaker A: Right. It kind of makes it less cryptic and less and less weird. Do you, like, are you guys thinking about branching out from lending? Or is this, like. Or, or lending is, like, a big enough problem for Aave, like, as a single focus point? It is $2 trillion of the $2 trillion of global lending. Is that a big enough challenge?
00:35:12.353 - 00:36:33.450, Speaker C: It feels big. I mean, we do have a lot of ideas and kind of, like, we have a lot of brainstorming sessions and come up with all kinds of things that you could build, you know, but we usually give them away in hackathons. You know, like we, we try to give away as much as possible, especially if it's stuff that could be built on Aave. You know, it strengthens our ecosystem and we have a lot of fun, but kind of like, it's, it's really difficult to expand because in terms of product offerings and because there's so much things to do in the current protocol, there's new, new money markets that will be opened, you know, and also kind of like, besides that, like different kinds of asset listings and a lot of risk involved. And I think, like, the risk side is the most burdensome. It's actually not the development, of course, you need to develop very securely. But for us, what we have seen, like, the economical risk modeling and risk assessment, that's the kind of, like a challenging part because, like, you kind of have to, you know, add assets or create markets in a way that you prepare for the divorced.
00:36:33.450 - 00:37:28.386, Speaker C: And that is the challenge because, let's say when there is a lot of upside, like the, there is a market which is going up and there's sort of things happening, there's sort of hype going on and you still have to think, like, you know, that the market might go down and model it that way. It's very burdensome and challenging, you know, and for us there is quite a lot of things. But I think what happens with Aave, with the protocol is that it will open up in the sense that anyone can contribute to it, like, in the very core. So that will help, like, other people to. To contribute and build things and build additional stuff in the ecosystem and get crown. We already have grants that we give. I think we have given, like, over 60 or 70 grants, but basically they can request themselves from the Dao and build things.
00:37:28.386 - 00:38:03.398, Speaker C: And that is pretty cool. You could actually request in the future, for example, from the DAO to build something related to aave on, for example, Solana. So that's the kind of, like a thing, you know, and that we even don't know where it will go. And I like it that way. I mean, because, like, for me, it's already, like, a lot of work in the sense, and I will be happy if there's a bunch of developers, like, continuing all directions and trying things out and building things. Like, honestly, I would.
00:38:03.446 - 00:39:09.646, Speaker A: If anyone is, if anyone is listening, we will match that grant from Abby to build anything on Solana, for sure. Like, I think that's another bit like, like I like grew up in like the nineties as an engineer, like you know, teenager in the nineties coding and like trying to hack Linux together. And I remember this huge fight between open source like Linux folks and Microsoft and SEO and IBM and all this craziness. And like it's awesome to see that all of that is forgotten that like open source is the only way to build software. And like there's so much encouragement to go like reuse and build stuff in the open like through grant. So this is like, it's just like kind of been like I think one of the biggest beneficiaries of, of like innovation has been like from crypto has been just open source development has like a really good model now. Like you can go build a protocol if you can come up with like a brand new financial structure.
00:39:09.646 - 00:39:19.874, Speaker A: You can actually like build open source code and have a like reasonable standard of living. Like it's not like no longer like a hobbyist job like in the dark.
00:39:20.494 - 00:40:08.170, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean like when we are thinking how we want to see the future of development we try to look actually the bitcoin core development but maybe even more how Linux has evolved and the contributors to Linux. The fascinating part that the early contributors are still contributing. There's interesting distributions of Linux, different models. Like I think that is quite optimal thing. And interestingly, I mean Linux, it's the most used operating system. I mean probably if they would have crypto economics, maybe it will be the most popular desktop.
00:40:08.170 - 00:40:12.374, Speaker C: I mean people will put more effort to build better user experiences.
00:40:18.564 - 00:40:29.384, Speaker A: By 2030 a Linux distribution will ICO, right. Linux and desktop will have an ICO. That's my favorite prediction.
00:40:30.564 - 00:41:21.512, Speaker C: You'll have some sort of like a cpu mining there or whatnot. No, but it's a beautiful comparison and kind of like I also agree that you don't see this kind of like proprietary technology versus open source. I think for example hashgraph is proprietary technology and I haven't seen it going anywhere. That's the thing because I mean, and also I don't even know if there's any other way to build on public blockchains in a way because smart contracts talk with each other. So if they interact with each other, I mean they, there has to be like waived rights to some extent. I, I don't know, like, and I.
00:41:21.528 - 00:41:51.214, Speaker A: Think more specifically like the first point that you mentioned when you have these recursive value loops you need to actually know the contract that you're using because if you, if you can't analyze it. How can you make any trust assumptions about the value that it's locking? Like, it, it becomes like, I think, like, if those systems are not open, I don't think you, I think you lose all of this, like, composability that we have across defi like that. That to me is like a really frightening part.
00:41:52.074 - 00:42:19.234, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, if you look at contracts where, you know, you basically don't see any, like, verification and, you know, it's just putting money there. It's just like, it's completely kind of like you. You will never know what's, what's going to happen. I don't think it can work like that. Even like, you know, let's say if there is a. If Aave would have closed contracts, I don't think we, anyone will build on Aave.
00:42:19.234 - 00:42:23.614, Speaker C: It's just, it's too risky. You don't know what's, what's going on.
00:42:25.034 - 00:42:38.344, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, like part of the, like, I think part of the kind of a hack with open source is you need to kind of like, convince people to use your code. It's not just like you build it and people will use it, you know.
00:42:38.384 - 00:43:21.894, Speaker C: Like, yeah, but, yeah, and the cool part is that people can just, you know, fix small problems, you know, because once you fix small problem, you can scale it. Like, you can scale it as many users there is in defi. The irony, of course, here is that Defi doesn't have many users. But the thing is that if this thing scale, the situation will be completely different. If everyone who needs finance will actually consume defi. You just need to solve one single thing. You will be like the guy who invented the like button, and you have the biggest product out there.
00:43:28.214 - 00:43:43.634, Speaker A: Part of the joy of COVID development or being a COVID startup founder is to get your kids right next to you. Did you come into the space as an engineer or as like a finance guy?
00:43:44.374 - 00:44:39.204, Speaker C: Actually, I built on web two, basically financial, more at working capital. But this was like when I was in my teen years and early twenties, and then I decided to actually study law. And when I was studying law in my last years, I practically was researching about contracts, automatization, and actually more about, you know, execution and how, you know, you could create new innovative ways of kind of self enforcement, you know, and I stumbled upon on smart contracts, and that's, that's something that got me into, into the space. And then I kind of, I wanted to build something related, you know, like legal tech.
00:44:39.544 - 00:44:39.856, Speaker A: But.
00:44:39.880 - 00:45:01.174, Speaker C: But then somehow, like, I went back to like doing financial applications, you know, it's just something, you know, when you see like yields and interest rates and you know, it's just like, for me that's like super addictive in the sense that, you know, I get yields. I don't know why, but it's just some very addictive to me.
00:45:02.794 - 00:46:23.760, Speaker A: That's funny. I like, I spend most of my day looking at like grafana dashboards and like looking for milliseconds to optimize. So it gets to each his own, right? Like, that's pretty funny. I mean, that's, that's fascinating that you like, started like looking into law first because I think that like, the way that you framed it, that you're looking for enforceable structures is like a really good way to describe smart contracts that like these are actually like automatically enforceable. Like they're enforced by the code, right? And that's so different from like law and like how we build, like how we have these lending agreements that have to have like a lawsuit and like, you know, like at the end of it, right? Like that's the only threat that that's that, like, actually I wonder if like if we have, you know, like 2300 million people on one chain. Like, it seems like it's possible for those structures in the broader sense to form just within that community. Like if that community gets big enough, we essentially, I think, do discover reputation, right.
00:46:23.760 - 00:46:37.784, Speaker A: And credit scores just from within. Like, to me it seems like, like, yeah, this is, this is almost like those folks that are like, like you said, like trying this stuff for a year and giving up. They're just too early, you know?
00:46:38.404 - 00:47:28.002, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. I think once. One example even is that, I mean, you know, people use different kind of name services and, you know, and also let's say you have various, you know, nfts and, and you collect stuff. You know, you kind of have like, I will not even say portfolio because they might have value because you and other people value and then they might be traded and that is why, you know, you know, they have value. But imagine like, let's say if I have like 80, 90 different nfts, you know, some are important to me, some are less, might be even valuable there. That doesn't matter. Then I have different kinds of like DAO memberships.
00:47:28.002 - 00:48:32.424, Speaker C: And those DAO membership might be like, let's say they're not like, you know, put 50 meters here and you get a DAO membership and now you can vote stuff. But it could be just like you're part of the DAO because you are part of, let's say a community somewhere in Ohio. Let's say, you know, and then you have a bunch of other things in your so called, like, profile portfolio and maybe if you lock them that you can't move from your address, maybe that's a way you could actually, you know, it becomes a, some sort of like a credit, not a social credit, but something in between. That and what I like about this thing is that there's so much subjective value. It's not about like, let's say you have 10,000 worth of tokens there and, you know, you get a 5000 loan, but it might be like most of the stuff is worthless for everyone else, but they're worth for you and you don't want to get rid of them in that sense. So these communities are important in that way.
00:48:34.164 - 00:49:09.084, Speaker A: My thoughts were that like, like there's like the civil problem right now with Web two where I can kind of join like every Reddit community and every Facebook group, but I can't do the same thing with tokens, right? Like I actually have to go buy them. So there's like almost like a proof of work, kind of like, like I had to go work and get money, right? There's a proof of work civil resistance for tokens for that membership. So, like, me picking a particular set of groups is like me actually betting on those communities.
00:49:09.594 - 00:50:13.574, Speaker C: Yeah. And some of them like the work can be like, I mean, something like easy, like introduce yourself or like, you know, I don't know, there could be many, many things. So I think the community aspect is something that will grow even more than finance because like people need finance in various things, but the actual community interaction is more interesting. I could imagine that of this hackathon we will see some of like implementation of some sort of like messaging or various things where you need like high frequency because it's not just about, you know, trading. There's a bunch of other examples and it's good. Like, you know, I think, like what's important for, let's say, Solana, is that like the projects or the hacks, they will kind of like represent the culture and the community. And that is like what will be important and drives traction and interest and curiosity.
00:50:13.574 - 00:50:41.274, Speaker C: And that is why when I said that this is probably the first time when something like this is happening, where people are hacking basically blockchain related and blockchain related hacks with high frequency on this scale is something that's is going to be very, very different than other hackathons that I have seen or judged or participated in.
00:50:42.254 - 00:51:07.444, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, I'm super excited to see what happens. Well, we're basically getting to the end of the hour. I want to give you a chance to talk about like, v two and what, what that looks like. You mentioned that there's, you guys were betting that that's going to be like the, the biggest thing for Aave. And I'm excited to actually know, like, what are these also, what are the features that you guys are shipped?
00:51:08.024 - 00:51:57.464, Speaker C: Absolutely. So what's interesting about b two is it becomes transactional in the sense that, you know, very, like, fluid. Like now the, now the thing is that when you deposit into Aave, let's say, dai churn interest, if you want to earn, let's say you make a decision. I want to actually earn on USDT because of higher yield or different risk profile. I mean, and you never know when that has emergency shutdown. Just kidding. Basically you would have to withdraw, sell the die, buy USDT, and, you know, and put it in back to Aave.
00:51:57.464 - 00:52:25.444, Speaker C: And now you could basically do one click, and that happens on the background. So it's basically, there will be a flash loan, takes the position, sells it and buys the new position. And, well, actually it's a token swap. But for example, the same with the loan position. You could swap your borrow rate the same way. And also you can swap your collateral. Essentially, let's say you borrowed USDC, you have Eid collateral there.
00:52:25.444 - 00:53:05.356, Speaker C: You could actually, next block, you could change it to, let's say, USDC collateral, you can change it to other collateral, link collateral, whatnot. And actually you have a collateral trading there. And you can also close your loan position with a collateral. And also the amount of gas optimization we have done, we reduced like half of the gas already. So, and that will probably not save us. But, but still, like, interesting here is that, like, you can shuffle your positions very easily as an end user. And if you build on top of all, you can also use this functionality.
00:53:05.356 - 00:53:33.784, Speaker C: So in essence, like, that becomes pretty, pretty. There's a bunch of other cool stuff, you know, like private markets. So you could actually create a completely different market, have permissioned market, and, you know, do your own thing. But I'm most fascinated about this, like, fluidness. And their positions will be tokenized. Like, the list is very long, but those are like the main things that's.
00:53:34.844 - 00:54:08.568, Speaker A: I think I kind of get what you're saying, which is tokenizing every aspect of the lending part. Yeah, and that to me is like, so Unix, because I think the token is like the pipe operator in Unix. And it's awesome to kind of think of it that way. Can we actually make everything fungible and make all these parts like pipes? Right. Like, to me these are pipes, right. Stuff goes in on one end, stuff comes out on the other end. And if you can like start plugging them together, I think that's, that's where magic happens.
00:54:08.568 - 00:54:13.384, Speaker A: That's kind of like the true form of composability. So that's awesome. But that's really cool.
00:54:13.544 - 00:54:29.124, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I mean, we're happy when, when this gets out. You know, we're working basically morning to evening. Be doing that too long now, but it will be pretty cool. Pretty cool release. Cool.
00:54:29.984 - 00:54:45.424, Speaker A: That's cool. Well, thank you so much for being out here. I hope, I hope this conversation inspired the folks that are listening and they can kind of start thinking about like build small, simple things that you can ship that. That's my advice. I don't know. Do you have any advice for folks?
00:54:46.644 - 00:55:15.404, Speaker C: Yeah. And like build anything. You know, like it doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to be defi. I mean, I'm doing Defi because I've been like interested in finance, but build anything, you know, you can use Defi as a way to empower your thing. And that's exactly what I would say as well. I mean, practically building one thing very well, securely is the way to go.
00:55:22.144 - 00:55:31.532, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool.
00:55:31.628 - 00:55:42.676, Speaker B: I think, I think we're just about at time. We said we were going to do 30 minutes and we still, still pulled in the hour. So thank you. Thank you staying for the time.
00:55:42.860 - 00:55:43.380, Speaker A: Of course.
00:55:43.412 - 00:56:23.210, Speaker B: Thank you, tolly. We have two more events going on tomorrow. We have a 10:00 a.m. Fireside chat with Robert Lesher, who is the CEO and founder of Compound. And then we actually have the future of Defi where we have a handful of individuals, including, you say, I believe it's your final event with us three, three in a row, where we're going to just take a look at the next wave of decentralized finance. And so I will post registration links for both those events in the chat and it looked like there were a few questions. I don't know if you had a chance, Danny.
00:56:23.210 - 00:56:30.134, Speaker B: It looks like someone was curious about when avifiat will be available. I don't know if you want to tackle that r1 quick before we jumped off.
00:56:32.114 - 00:57:11.314, Speaker C: Well, you can actually deposit. There is a couple of stuff. Basically you could use ramp network. And then we have something else as well where you can you can, you can basically go from fiat to deposits. But I guess it's also question about payments accounts, which we, we have a electronic money license that we received that is something we're working beginning of this next year, so it takes a bit of time. So the version two is now on, and I think it's. Version two is weeks away, not, not far.
00:57:12.294 - 00:57:13.126, Speaker B: There you go.
00:57:13.230 - 00:57:13.598, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:57:13.646 - 00:57:20.954, Speaker B: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, as always, for your time. This was, this was an incredible talk. And thank you to, to everyone who attended.
00:57:21.374 - 00:57:21.998, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone.
00:57:22.046 - 00:57:23.034, Speaker B: Have a great day, everyone.
00:57:23.614 - 00:57:24.394, Speaker C: Cheers.
00:57:26.654 - 00:57:28.286, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Take care.
00:57:28.430 - 00:57:28.814, Speaker C: Take care.
