If you can move money as easy as moving the Internet, then you have so many possibilities. We are unlocking global currencies so people are able to access USDC to on ramp, but also to off ramp to send money everywhere. So it is pretty much worthless money. They are able to protect themselves from this horrible inflation and then have money to actually live their lives. We are overtaking traditional systems using blockchain and we are providing more freedom and more accessibility. That is what I think that is the game changing thing for decaf on Solana.
