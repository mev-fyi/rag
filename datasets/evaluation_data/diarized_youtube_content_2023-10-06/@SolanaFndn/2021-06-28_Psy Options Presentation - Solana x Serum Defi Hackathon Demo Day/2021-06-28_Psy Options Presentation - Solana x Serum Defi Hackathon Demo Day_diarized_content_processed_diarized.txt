00:00:00.360 - 00:00:10.034, Speaker A: All right, looks like we're live today. We have with us the founders of psyoptions, Tommy Johnson and Taylor Johnson, the killer twin brothers. Welcome, guys.
00:00:10.734 - 00:00:11.994, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:00:12.294 - 00:00:14.830, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I'll leave it off to you guys.
00:00:14.942 - 00:00:15.262, Speaker C: Take.
00:00:15.318 - 00:00:16.554, Speaker A: Take the show away.
00:00:17.494 - 00:00:54.714, Speaker B: Yeah, so just want to give some high level updates. So, since the hackathon, we started the hackathon with a simple idea of how we could build options on chain. And, like, the main focus was to bring a traditional finance feel to defi. And the only way we realized we could do that is by bringing options to an order book and building it on top of serum and Solana. So it worked out well for the hackathon. However, when we originally came up with the protocol and put some architecture, or started designing the original architecture, we had.
00:00:55.414 - 00:00:56.926, Speaker C: A little bit of an understanding of.
00:00:56.950 - 00:01:44.284, Speaker B: How Solana's runtime worked from the first hackathon, but really, like, not the best understanding of how we could architect something like this. So in order to get something off the ground, we just picked the first architecture and ran with it, which ended up being a pretty bad idea. So the first architecture that we built was not scalable, limited the number of options someone could create, and ultimately just would be more expensive and slow. So since the hackathon, we actually refactored the entire protocol, pretty much wrote the whole thing from scratch, same instruction set, but now it's able to scale and uses spls to denote writers and things like that. Tom, I don't know if you have anything to add on how that refactor went.
00:01:44.904 - 00:02:18.106, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it was definitely necessary. And now you can have option markets with unlimited. We're kind of using like a two token based system. So you'll see in our documentation that we have, when you go to mint an option, you get an option token, and then you also get a writer token. We'll go over that in the live demo. But so the option token is what you actually sell, and that denotes the contract for someone to have the option to swap their, quote, asset for your underlying asset that you put into the pool. I'm wishing anchor.
00:02:18.106 - 00:02:45.734, Speaker C: I'm wishing we went with Anchor because we're going to have another refactor coming up here soon because anchor is the way to go from what we're seeing now. But we're just sticking with this for v one for now. I guess we'll jump into the other updates, too. We finally pulled someone on to manage the Twitter account, run media and community who's doing a killer job. Stockmart. Unfortunately, he's sick with COVID right now, but he's been really helping us out. Taylor and I were running with Twitter during the hackathon.
00:02:45.734 - 00:03:30.136, Speaker C: We're just engineers. Like, we're not good at that stuff. We had no idea what we were doing. And then we also pulled on a couple more community contributors working on tracking PSI options in serum data so we can give trade history, p and l, all that kind of longer term data that you can't really just pull on chain or store on chain and pull from the chain. And once we get that up and running, we know that's a feature request. A lot of the people who've been in the early alpha have been asking for is they really want to see a nice, comprehensive dashboard for their current risk, their p and l, and their trade history among the Greeks and other things. And then I'll give one more tailor.
00:03:30.136 - 00:03:40.964, Speaker C: You can go through the rest of the bullets. But we also had myself and our other engineers have put in our notice and quit our jobs, so we are going to be taking side options on full time.
00:03:41.694 - 00:03:42.990, Speaker A: Let's go, baby.
00:03:43.142 - 00:03:53.334, Speaker C: I know it's been a long time coming, but, I mean, I think we talked Tristan back in October and said, oh, I really want to get into it. Here we are, diving full into it.
00:03:53.454 - 00:04:00.434, Speaker A: That's worth mentioning. I think the reason these guys are building is because we all went surfing together, and I just shilled Solana like, there's no tomorrow.
00:04:00.734 - 00:04:12.994, Speaker C: Luckily, it cracked. I was like, oh, Tristan, we're just sitting in the water. Waves weren't that great. I'm like, tristan, how do I get involved? I need to get involved. You know, we tried. That was, what, back in October, September, and then we.
00:04:13.854 - 00:04:15.194, Speaker B: I think it was August.
00:04:16.134 - 00:04:39.036, Speaker C: I don't know, sometime, like in the. Towards the end of the fall. And it's just, like, wild to think, like, you know, we had that one conversation we had been playing with Solano before that, and then we entered the first hackathon just doing like an oracle. Didn't really have anything come out of that. Had another project that we tried. Didn't really go anywhere. And then, you know, so it's message to everyone else who's watching this and getting involved.
00:04:39.036 - 00:05:28.476, Speaker C: Just keep coming up with ideas, keep throwing shit at the wall until you see something that sticks. We were just getting up and running on Solana to give a background for those who don't know why we started psyoption is we wanted to automate a triple income strategy in traditional finance, which is really a yield generation strategy. Using your you know, uS dollars or your actual stock to sell covered calls or cash secured puts to generate yield. And we asked the brokerage for API access. They shot us down and talked to us like we were idiots. And we're like, all right, well, if we built options into the blockchain, everyone would have API access inherently built in, and anyone can run any automated strategy they want. And that was kind of like, why don't we just build options on Solana? Serum is already an order book.
00:05:28.476 - 00:05:42.064, Speaker C: You know, Solana's handling the throughput and the low block times. You can give a true traditional options feel on the blockchain. And so that was really the genesis, too, of how we pivoted and said, let's just start writing options.
00:05:42.524 - 00:05:45.276, Speaker A: Give us a demo. We want a demo.
00:05:45.460 - 00:05:49.508, Speaker C: Taylor will go through the rest of the updates, then we'll go through a.
00:05:49.516 - 00:06:26.900, Speaker B: Few, a few more, few more high level updates. So a couple of other things we did that are like C minor, but, you know, pretty, pretty important for onboarding community, things like that. Like we set up documentation. So it's at docs, psyoptions IO. So like, if you're in our private alpha, you can, you know, read more on how to set up wallets and stuff there, and then also see, you know, our instruction set and kind of how to get started if you're, if you're trying to develop on top of psyoptions. More, more on that later. So on that note, open source, a JavaScript package that has our instruction bindings and things like that.
00:06:26.900 - 00:07:05.394, Speaker B: So any front ends that want to make calls to psyoptions protocol, they can more easily do it in terms of where the protocol is at. We're currently in product, we're currently in private alpha. So onboarding more people every day into that. So if you're in our discord, feel free to Ormjohn, and we're happy to, to have more people joining that and providing feedback. We want this thing to be as community driven as possible. We had a peer review, definitely looking to get a formal audit and want more people looking at our code. Just, it's up to par.
00:07:05.394 - 00:07:36.164, Speaker B: And then we've also actually started onboarding some market makers and helping them get onboarded for psyoptions and serum trading. That's been one of our biggest focus. I think that's something that's pretty lacking in the Solana serum ecosystem right now. I think the more institutions and the more market makers that we can bring on, the better liquidity for serum, the better liquidity for SCI options, and we can hopefully get the Solana DeFi ecosystem to just become more robust.
00:07:36.824 - 00:08:10.886, Speaker C: I think that's been a big portion of our time. Aside from development is really talking to market makers, learning what their needs are, learning what their wants are, and then just kind of talking through them about their current infrastructure and how they can get up and running and what they need from us. Because without liquidity, the products not very useful. So that's a big thing we're trying to time together here is the product, as well as making sure that there is liquidity. But yeah.
00:08:11.070 - 00:08:11.550, Speaker A: Yep.
00:08:11.622 - 00:08:15.022, Speaker C: Jeff, if you have anything else. Should we jump into a demo? Unless Tristan has other questions.
00:08:15.078 - 00:08:21.742, Speaker A: Yeah, I have, I have. I don't have a question. I just have a compliment. People are loving the victorian style strongman mustache, Tommy.
00:08:21.878 - 00:08:24.686, Speaker B: I just gotta say that. Gotta keep rocking it, dude.
00:08:24.710 - 00:08:25.954, Speaker A: That's the highlight here.
00:08:28.294 - 00:08:29.446, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm trying to get him to.
00:08:29.470 - 00:08:32.070, Speaker B: Keep it for BTC Miami next week.
00:08:32.182 - 00:08:34.932, Speaker C: I think I have to keep it. You have to keep it.
00:08:35.078 - 00:08:36.004, Speaker A: You have to.
00:08:36.704 - 00:08:48.416, Speaker C: Maybe I'll. Maybe I'll throw a poll out on Twitter and see what people think. Close this live stream out. Yeah. Taylor. Taylor was like, I have this cowboy hat back at, like, my parents house. And I was like, man, I wish I had the cowboy hat.
00:08:48.416 - 00:08:52.524, Speaker C: I'd rock the cowboy hat, the mustache, and walk around BTC Miami.
00:08:53.504 - 00:09:01.964, Speaker A: Do it. Stand up. You'll get all the investors in on site options. They'll be like, damn, this guy's got some balls. We're investing here. All right, show us the demo, guys. Sorry for stealing time.
00:09:02.824 - 00:09:09.884, Speaker C: Oh, good. Let me just share my screen here. All righty. Are we up?
00:09:10.944 - 00:09:11.884, Speaker B: We're up.
00:09:13.064 - 00:09:38.344, Speaker C: Awesome. All right, so the landing page hasn't really changed much. We're working with, actually, another update. We're working with a few designers to actually start hashing out an actual landing page. Fix our open position page. We'll go more into that later. There were a lot of issues getting up and running with RPC nodes and all that kind of stuff because there was rate limiting, and you have no idea what those rate limits look like and all that.
00:09:38.344 - 00:10:27.390, Speaker C: One actually unique thing, just a tidbit for all those other developers out there is we used and shout out to Bitsushi, our homie, for suggesting the solution. We use a service worker that actually queues requests. So that way we're not pounding a bunch of asynchronous requests and we don't have to change our application code at all. And it just really cleaned up all those issues where you see like a corsairror and it's really just coming from too many requests. Response from the RPC node. So that's your developer tip, but similar. We changed some of the fonts, some of the UI, we put the implied volatility calculation in there for the bids and asks, this looks a little bare right now because we literally just reset the alpha after one of our faucets were drained.
00:10:27.390 - 00:11:15.914, Speaker C: So if you're looking at, you know, setting up an alpha or beta for the community, like there's definitely some points we can share there. Maybe a blog post coming. We added Phantom support. So long math because we were really just running with solit originally and once we're connected we can actually see the buy and sell to open up the dialogue. We have various, we allow for various contract sizes for different assets. This is still a work in progress. This is one of those things that we're working with market makers and other people who are very big options traders of what kind of sizes do you want to see? How should this function? But, so for example for BTC we just have one.
00:11:15.914 - 00:11:17.718, Speaker C: So it takes the underlying is.
00:11:17.766 - 00:11:19.798, Speaker A: Tommy, can you make this full screen please?
00:11:19.926 - 00:11:24.234, Speaker C: Yeah, how's that?
00:11:26.014 - 00:11:26.994, Speaker A: That's good.
00:11:30.614 - 00:12:02.618, Speaker C: I don't know if I zoom in. Okay, so not much of this has changed. We added some color though, which really looks beautiful, and then really did a lot of work here for the buy sell dialogue. I don't even know if this was actually fully functional when we actually did finish the hackathon, but it was done shortly thereafter. But so we can set a limit order and sell this sell. You know, we're going to basically wrap one BTC. That's the collateral required to sell.
00:12:02.618 - 00:12:42.084, Speaker C: So it's the underlying of the actual contract and we're going to offer it up for 15,000 USDC. All this is just like test stuff you can see here trying to approve the transaction. And this just basically wrote one contract and then sold one contract. So that transaction that I approved really did two things. It first interacted with the PSI options protocol to lock up one BTC. The protocol gave back a writer token and option token. And then we took that option token and we sold it on the serum order book that was created for this market.
00:12:42.084 - 00:13:14.172, Speaker C: And then we also have market the ability to like market, buy and sell. We'll just buy one here. As long as I don't self trade. Boom. I guess I don't have, I kind of, I should have done localhost, right Taylor, so I could show how initializing markets would be. Yeah.
00:13:14.228 - 00:13:15.796, Speaker B: Do you want to just pop that up real quick?
00:13:15.940 - 00:13:20.332, Speaker C: Yeah, as long as no one cares. Yeah.
00:13:20.348 - 00:13:56.216, Speaker B: If anyone in chat has questions while Tommy pops open his local development, happy to. Happy to field some questions. One question we got that I already answered in chat, but just, I'll voice it for everyone. Was, are we planning on launching with just BTC? So, no, it's unclear exactly what we'll launch with. We'll likely launch with assets that have the most liquid option markets currently. So probably BTC ETH and then maybe throw a couple of fun ones in there, such as like Solana and things like that.
00:13:56.240 - 00:13:56.448, Speaker C: But.
00:13:56.496 - 00:14:30.274, Speaker B: But we'll probably field, field thoughts from the community before we make any, you know, decisions like that. What are your backgrounds? So Tommy and I both studied electrical engineering, and then Tommy did some, some hardware internships and I did, I focused mainly on software, and then we both ended up converging onto software. Just, we both like building products and getting things off the ground. And with software, it's pretty easy to do those things as a solo or duo development group.
00:14:31.094 - 00:14:38.710, Speaker C: I have many comments on the hardware versus software. I won't get into that for another time.
00:14:38.902 - 00:14:42.790, Speaker A: All right, Tommy, show us, because then we're going to have to get you off here after this.
00:14:42.942 - 00:15:03.454, Speaker C: Yeah. All right. So the protocol is very flexible. It really just takes in a bunch of parameters. So like, let's just really quickly check what markets we have already made for June 25. Okay. So it really just takes in this contract size, the underlying asset, the quote, asset.
00:15:03.454 - 00:15:45.464, Speaker C: Some of this is restricted by the UI, but it makes it so anyone could really, if you wanted to, if you created a new token and you wanted to create options for it, you could go in and initialize a psy options market for that asset. So I really just created a couple accounts and actually initialized the market. And now you see here that the June 25 contract size of one BTC over USDC is already there. And then the UI allows you to initialize the CRM market. And then once that's all set up, you have your order book, you have your options, and people can start using them.
00:15:47.364 - 00:15:57.504, Speaker A: Amazing, guys. Thank you so much. Can you please put your Twitter and your discord in the, on the chat of the twitch, please, so people can have a place to follow up on what you guys are doing.
00:15:57.884 - 00:16:03.664, Speaker C: Definitely. Let me grab a discord link.
00:16:04.964 - 00:16:06.944, Speaker A: Sorry, I lost Internet. I'm back.
00:16:07.404 - 00:16:08.222, Speaker C: Oh, good.
00:16:08.348 - 00:16:14.354, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Thank you so much. I'm going to have Norbert. Jordan, thanks for having us.
