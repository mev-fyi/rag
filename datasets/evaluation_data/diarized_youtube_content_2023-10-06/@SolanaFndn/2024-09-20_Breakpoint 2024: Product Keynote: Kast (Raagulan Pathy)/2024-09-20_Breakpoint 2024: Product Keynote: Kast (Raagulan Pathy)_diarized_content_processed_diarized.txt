00:00:14.680 - 00:01:13.855, Speaker A: Hi everyone, my name is Raghulin Pathi, I'm the co founder of Cast. Previously before starting Cast, I set up the Circle business in Asia, best known for USDC and I'm very passionate about stablecoins. The reason is that for about 150 countries in the world today, banking is basically not working anymore. But stablecoins are a real alternative which is real, which people can use. But the actual usability of stablecoins, the experience today is not great because you've got to go to an exchange or a wallet. So we thought what about if you could build the world's future bank on chain because you have all the components such as like a checking account, a savings account with yield bank, stable coins and a card. And what if we could deliver that to the world? And we believe Solana is one of the only ecosystems on which you could build this fast, cheap and built on Solana.
00:01:13.855 - 00:02:09.755, Speaker A: The CAST magic is really that we spend an incredible amount of time on our experience. So you can sign up in KYC in three minutes and it supports people from nearly any country in the world and we're continuously expanding that. And so we're trying to strip away the complex user experience that you see in most of crypto and really make it very, very simple. So you can go and sign up today on Cast Off Finance. Now we have also launched Solana Validator which is with our partner Kiln, which most people would know. And you can go and look for the Cast validator today and stake on there. It's a 0% commission, 100% MEV kickback and it's about a 7.6
00:02:09.755 - 00:03:03.465, Speaker A: APY. Now the main reason we're launching this will be apparent in just a few seconds because you might be wondering what's a future bank that people are trying to build on chain got to do with a Solana validator. And for that we introduce PayFi. We're going to allow you to hold up to spend up to 60% of your soul that you hold with us interest free forever. And this is the first time that it's actually going to happen. And so this means that on certain plans we'll obviously hold it in our validator and use that to subsidize your spending. But it'll be a very, very seamless experience that you'll be able to tap and pay anywhere.
00:03:03.465 - 00:03:54.385, Speaker A: Now if you think that was good, we're releasing the first ever Solana card. This is going to be available in pre order now. You can get your free virtual card very soon and you can use the app today to get it, but I know you're coming here to just not see ordinary things. You want to see something a little bit crazy. So we also have a black metal card which we've designed which illuminates on tap pay. This goes for a 10 SOL, but includes a whole bunch of other benefits. And so this is a bit of a show off factor that you can take take around and you can tap and pay with your cool Solana card.
00:03:54.385 - 00:04:43.489, Speaker A: But that's not the real show. The real show is what I'm about to show you. The real show is the Solana Solid Gold card. This is for those who really feel that way, that they really want to go and show off the heaviest solid Gold card ever made in the world. We actually have a normal gold card as well in between, which I didn't have time to put into the presentation, which you can get. But with the solid Gold card, and it cost us more than $10,000 to make one of these, you actually get three of the supplementary normal gold cards as well. And you can hold 60% interest free on your card and you can spend against your soul and you also get the highest points forever.
00:04:43.489 - 00:05:11.977, Speaker A: Now we only have 100 of these for sale. It's really if you really are crazy and that's the way that you want to go. But it's available for pre order now. But in either case, if you want to be part of the Solana ecosystem, we'll be releasing the virtual card for free. And so just to show you, I do actually have a version of the Solid Gold card right here that you can actually see. And we're super excited to partner with Solana and introduce this to the ecosystem. Thank you.
00:05:11.977 - 00:05:14.425, Speaker A: Go to cas.finance Solana to find out more.
