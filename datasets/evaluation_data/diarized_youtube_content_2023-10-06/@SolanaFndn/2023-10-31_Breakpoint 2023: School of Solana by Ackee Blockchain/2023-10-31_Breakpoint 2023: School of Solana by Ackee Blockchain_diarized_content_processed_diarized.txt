00:00:01.320 - 00:00:12.714, Speaker A: Hi, we are from akiblokchain and we would like to present you our latest bootcamp. So I'm Joseph.
00:00:13.614 - 00:00:16.114, Speaker B: And I'm Alexandra.
00:00:18.534 - 00:00:53.362, Speaker A: And I'm CEO of Aki Blockchain. And I'm also an assistant professor at the Czech Technical University in Prague. And maybe you have not heard about Aki blockchain. So we are auditors. We are auditing Solana and Ethereum. But besides the auditing, we always like to return something back to the community. So that's why we are doing this education and we are running the school of Solana and we are also teaching at the Czech Technical University in Prague.
00:00:53.362 - 00:01:27.154, Speaker A: And we also believe in open source. So we are working on some quite cool tooling. But speaking about audits, these are some of our clients. So probably or you have heard about neon EVM or marinate finance. These are the clients we've audited on Solana. We are also quite active on the Ethereum ecosystem where we audited accelerate one inch or Trader Joe. And we also are very happy that we have quite close connections and relationships with both foundations.
00:01:27.154 - 00:02:16.276, Speaker A: And speaking about the developer tooling, I can tell you big news that right now we are working on the first open source fuzzer for Solana. We just got a grant from Solana foundation to build this tool, so now it's in progress. And also we have tools from the Ethereum world which basically inspired us to create this fuzzer also for Solana. So on etune, we are running wake testing framework and we have also extension for visual studio. And this kind of package helps developers and auditors to do better their job. But here we are to speak about the school of Solana, and I'm handing over to Sasha.
00:02:16.420 - 00:02:52.948, Speaker B: Yes, so some of you already heard about the school of Solana. We run it twice a year and it's 100% online and free and it's backed by Solana foundation. So thank you, Solana foundation, for making this happen. What this call is about, it's about introduction to Solana. It's about introduction to rust and anchor framework. And as a final output, you'll need to create your first working dapp. It is not about introduction to blockchain, so you need to have some knowledge before applying.
00:02:52.948 - 00:03:52.770, Speaker B: And neither it is an advanced trust or Solana programming course and it won't make you reach in nine weeks either. Yeah, so as I mentioned, you need to have some previous programming experience. It's not like zero to Solana, it's more like Python or JavaScript or whatever to Solana. And you need to understand some basic concepts like what is blockchain? If it sounds like you, then you'll need to fill an application form, complete an entry task so that we're sure that you indeed have some knowledge. If we see this, you'll get an NFT of acceptance and you'll verify with this NFT biometrica and you'll get access to discord where you'll be able to learn. We prerecord our lessons, we upload them to YouTube, you can watch them anytime. And we have some dedicated channels on discord to discuss every lecture and some other stuff.
00:03:52.770 - 00:04:41.524, Speaker B: And for your home tasks you'll use GitHub classrooms if you manage to make it. If you submit five and more tasks, if you create a working dev of your own, you'll get an NFT of completion and you'll be able to add a LinkedIn as a course to your LinkedIn. We had three runs so far. The third one is still ongoing. And throughout those three runs we had more than 1000 applicants and we accepted 700 of them. So we don't accept anyone. And we assume that we have more than 150 good developers who learned something thanks to us.
00:04:41.524 - 00:05:25.934, Speaker B: But not all of them were certified because they did, because we have some standards, we have some formal requirements, and not all of them met them. So they were only 73 people. And here you can see some of our favorite students from the previous runs who landed the job after completing the school of Solana. Our favorite one obviously is Andre who joined Aki blockchain as Solana auditor. Say hi to Andre, he's here. Also, we have two anonymous guys who landed their jobs as developers or engineers at other Solana projects. And here are our favorite dapps from the previous run.
00:05:25.934 - 00:05:57.544, Speaker B: D one election method certifications on blockchain very much like what we're doing by dropping nfts of compression multisig vault on Solana blockchain memories like it's a tool where you can create memories on blockchain and they're going to stay there forever. And a pad dev where you can meet a path and make sure his alive and happy and now passing to Joseph.
00:05:58.004 - 00:06:36.842, Speaker A: So maybe the obvious question is when will be the next run of our school? Because as we said, we usually do it two times a year. So the answer is we don't know yet. But if you keep on following us on Twitter, you will definitely know about it. And also Solana foundation usually retweets when there's announcement of a new cohort. So stay tuned and I would like to thank once again the Sola foundation for supporting this cohort. Also thank everyone who attended our school. And last but not least, thank to our tutors, Andre and Adam, and to Sasha for guiding us to the school.
00:06:36.842 - 00:06:41.974, Speaker A: So thank you very much. And if you have any questions, you can meet us here later after the talk.
00:06:43.674 - 00:06:46.434, Speaker B: Thank you. Bye.
