00:00:00.760 - 00:00:36.036, Speaker A: Welcome to the Solana Changelog. This is where we talk about the changes that happen on Solana Week by week. My name is Jacob Creech. I am leading developer relations at Solana foundation. I'm joined with Joe and Colin, who are both on my team. So the first thing that we're going to go over is there is a new proposal for signing messages with the ledger. So what this means is you can sign messages that are non transaction to verify, like, hey, I own the wallet that I say I am.
00:00:36.036 - 00:00:43.544, Speaker A: This has been a greatly requested feature for Ledger and I'm very happy that it's starting to come out.
00:00:45.564 - 00:00:54.304, Speaker B: Interesting. So why would you want to sign just a message instead of a transaction? What's the purpose there?
00:00:55.264 - 00:01:16.804, Speaker A: So yeah, if you. What it is is like you can sign like a text, just a text string or something that proves that you own the wallet. So that helps with a lot of like logins with, I think like audius uses that for login. Same with some other NFT marketplaces. It just proves that you own the wallet without having to send a transaction.
00:01:18.064 - 00:01:40.528, Speaker B: Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense, I guess. Next up we have, we're getting closer and closer to quic. Actually, 1.11 is going to have quic active. That's active in testnet right now while we're filming this, and soon that will be making its way out to Mainnet. We've got a few minor updates to quic in the past week.
00:01:40.528 - 00:02:05.694, Speaker B: Just a quick TLDR on Quic. If you don't know, it's built on top of UDP. It's a networking protocol and UDP is really, really lightweight and fast. And quic kind of adds like an extra layer of security there. And it also has a bunch of features that are going to help with things like transaction throughput. So some cool performance upgrades coming to Solana cluster and everybody's really, really been talking about it. There's a lot of anticipation about quic.
00:02:05.694 - 00:02:07.914, Speaker B: So we're happy it's getting closer and closer.
00:02:10.094 - 00:02:13.998, Speaker C: Sounds good. Quick TLD on Quick. I love that. No pun intended.
00:02:14.166 - 00:02:15.674, Speaker B: No Pam, no pump.
00:02:16.614 - 00:02:57.206, Speaker C: Couple more updates. So the Solana explorer has been updated to use APR dev for any of the anchor verified builds. Previously was using an old serum link, so if your Dapp was anchor verified but wasn't showing up, that should be visible now. Secondly, retrying transactions has been added to the core documentation. Previously it only lived on Solano Cookbook, which you should definitely check out. But it's now also been copied over to the official core documentation as well, because some people only read the official core docs. And finally shout out to John for catching a small bug on accounts.
00:02:57.206 - 00:03:37.904, Speaker C: So there was like a. I don't know if we all remember that some time ago an update was pushed that all accounts should be rent exempt by default. But yeah, there was like some code just lingering around that used to look and try to collect fees on newly created accounts. Uncorked that, and that's been removed. And I've got two resources for this week because why not? So this is not financial advice, but I personally like to see non react front end code on Solana. So shout out to Sylvest. I know, react, yeah, it's great, but just not for me.
00:03:37.904 - 00:04:00.726, Speaker C: Shout out to Sylvest for carrying the svelte mantle, who released the. That scaffold for svelte. That's really cool. Check that out. It's on the Solana developers GitHub. And my second resource of the week is Cardinal Labs. If you're doing anything to do with nfts, it's a really cool library that has some nice features around nfts.
00:04:00.726 - 00:04:03.554, Speaker C: I don't want to spoil that too much. Go check that out.
00:04:04.654 - 00:04:28.260, Speaker A: Cool. So that was the Solana changelog. Everything that's happened, really, this past week on Solana, if you're. If you ever want to reach out to any of us, you can find us on Twitter. I'm a. You can find Joe and Colin as well if you want to just try to message any of us. There's also devs, it's the Solana developer Twitter that will reach us.
00:04:28.260 - 00:04:30.104, Speaker A: So thank you for joining us.
00:04:30.804 - 00:04:32.164, Speaker C: Awesome. Until next time.
