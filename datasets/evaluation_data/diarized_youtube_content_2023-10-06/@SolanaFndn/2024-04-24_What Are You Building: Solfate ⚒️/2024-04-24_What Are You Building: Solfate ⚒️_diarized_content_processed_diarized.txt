00:00:04.360 - 00:00:28.600, Speaker A: Today, I'm joined by James from Solfate. So, please tell us, what are you building? Yeah. Solfate is a podcast. We interview builders and founders in the Solana ecosystem. Most of our listeners are probably Solana developers. So recently, we launched what's called the Solana Dev list, which is basically a list of verified Solana developers so that any airdrops in the ecosystem can airdrop to the devs. We want to reward who's actually building out the stuff that we all interact with day to day.
00:00:28.600 - 00:00:38.324, Speaker A: It sounds amazing. So everyone can just access this list? Yeah, yeah. It's a public list. If you've got an airdrop, go check it out and make sure that you reward the devs. Awesome. Thank you so much. Of course.
