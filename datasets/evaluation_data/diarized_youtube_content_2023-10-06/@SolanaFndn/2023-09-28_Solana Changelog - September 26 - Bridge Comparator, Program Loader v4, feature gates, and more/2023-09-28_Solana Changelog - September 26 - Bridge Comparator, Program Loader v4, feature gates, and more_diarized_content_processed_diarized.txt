00:00:04.320 - 00:00:09.766, Speaker A: Hello everyone, GMGM. I'm Nick from the Solana foundation and welcome to the changelog. How you doing, Jonas?
00:00:09.910 - 00:00:12.634, Speaker B: I'm doing great. Excited for your changelog?
00:00:13.054 - 00:00:40.474, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited for the changelog, excited for hyperdrive. All the events and everything in the ecosystem, I guess. Friendly reminder, while I'm at it is check out solana.com events. It's the community events page. You can find all sorts of events that are going on in the ecosystem from in person workshops, virtual workshops, in person events, things like that. And you can also find the link for hyperdrive office hours that the Devrel team at foundation is hosting twice a week.
00:00:40.474 - 00:00:47.010, Speaker A: So if you're building something for hyperdrive, then stop on in, ask questions if you got them. And don't forget to use stack exchange too.
00:00:47.202 - 00:01:30.912, Speaker B: Yeah, the office hours are in the hyperdrive discord, so make sure to join in there in the voice chat. We are there for an hour every Tuesday, every Thursday. Yeah, it's free time. You can ask whatever you want. And another nice thing that we found is Phantom released a new feature which is now like for every NFT collection, some of them which they picked or which applied, I guess they have a bunch of links now where you can stake and do missions. And so if you have an NFT collection now, you can contact Phantom and have all kinds of links to your connections to your NFT collections. Another really cool thing which we found is Jupyter exchange has now a list of bridges.
00:01:30.912 - 00:01:54.022, Speaker B: So this is super exciting. So if you go to Jupyter AG, you have now this new tab here, which is still an alpha, so be a bit careful with it. But you can now bridge from all kind of different currencies to other currencies. So now here I can, for example, swap 100 USDC on ethereum to 100 USDC on Solana. What do you think about that, Nick? Isn't that amazing?
00:01:54.198 - 00:02:07.446, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super cool. I big fan of Jupiter. This basically takes their swap idea and applies it to bridges. You can just compare all the bridges that they have support for on Jupiter and I think it's going to be really cool.
00:02:07.630 - 00:02:11.462, Speaker B: Yeah. And then there's this thing from Helios, right? What is this about?
00:02:11.638 - 00:02:28.202, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, this is a nice guide that Helios published on how quick works and what quic is. So it talks about just high level, like how QuIC is used to actually prevent some of the spam network traffic on the Solana blockchain. So if you're interested in trying to learn more about QWik check it out.
00:02:28.338 - 00:02:39.894, Speaker B: Yeah, Qwik is really interesting because it also provides you a certain quality of service depending on your stake weight. So it's a very interesting article to read. And what's your favorite commit this week?
00:02:40.914 - 00:03:47.874, Speaker A: There were two commits that I saw that are both related, actually. They're for Loader V four, and specifically one of them is for Loader V four, and the other one is a feature gate that enables Loader V four. And basically, Loader V four is the next iteration of the Loader program, which allows for program upgrades on the Solana runtime. It's really setting the stage for program runtime V two, and that's what this actual feature gate is for. Basically, if you don't already know, the feature gates are an epoch based system where certain features in the Solana blockchain will be activated on the various networks, whether it's Testnet, Devnet, or Mainnet. And as the community goes to adopt these and gets the ability to test out these different features and they get more and more stable, then they can be then iteratively activated on each of the respective networks. So yeah, it's the first public push for Runtimev two to make it so people can start interacting and figuring out all the good stuff on Runtimev two.
00:03:48.174 - 00:04:25.086, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm super excited for Runtimev two. And these feature gates are actually really cool because we use them in game development also, a lot like you release a feature to build a feature and at some point you say okay, now the feature is enabled and when there's a bug we could easily disable it. I'm not sure how easy that is on Solana, but if you want to follow the feature gates activation schedule, you can find it in the Solana Labs GitHub repository, and then you see here the epochs on which version they will activate and when they activate and what will activate. So that's a very interesting thing to follow. And yeah, I think we're already at the end, right?
00:04:25.230 - 00:04:38.110, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty much it for this week. It's been a good week and hope to see everyone at hyperdrive office hours if you're again, if you're looking for ideas, check out build Superteam. Fun. We'd love to see some interesting projects on Solana.
00:04:38.302 - 00:04:50.382, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely want to see what you're building. I saw a few really cool projects already, so also post about it on Twitter. Be loud about your project. The more people know about it, the more successful it will be for sure.
00:04:50.438 - 00:04:53.270, Speaker A: Tagalanadevs exactly.
00:04:53.462 - 00:04:54.406, Speaker B: See you guys next week.
00:04:54.430 - 00:04:54.566, Speaker A: Bye.
00:04:54.590 - 00:04:54.774, Speaker B: Bye.
00:04:54.814 - 00:04:55.374, Speaker A: Catch you next week.
