00:00:09.360 - 00:00:36.581, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. I think it's pretty rare for like any crypto event that we have like three ladies here. We always have this completely unbalanced like gender ratio and too many crypto bros. And then so now we finally have like two beautiful ladies founders sitting here, standing here and then four like steel man argument. Okay, so let's get started. And so the debate today is about the east and West.
00:00:36.581 - 00:00:56.829, Speaker A: So Joanna and Cindy, and what about you guys that both give us like introduction and also your definition on what is east and west. Right. Is it Russia east or west? Right. And then so is it at the east and west divided by geography, by land market preferences or by ideology? Okay, please, Joanna first.
00:00:56.917 - 00:01:33.299, Speaker B: Sure. Hey guys. My name is Joe Andersen. I'm the co founder and CEO of Soon. Soon is a SVM rollup stack, the most efficient SM rollup stack that brings the top performance of Solana virtual machine to other ecosystem starting with Ethereum. So the reason I think why I was chosen to argue for the west is because I spent most of my life in even though I was born in China, but you know, immigrated to the US very early on and have only worked with western companies in the past. Actually this includes even pre crypto.
00:01:33.299 - 00:02:10.061, Speaker B: So, you know, only worked in the west for the last two decades, including op optimism at Coinbase and later on at the ZK project called Alio. So to answer your question though, so you asked about how do we defined, right. West versus east to me is really just a geography definition. But specifically for the Russia, you know, how does that lie? Right? I would say by the Russian money being parked in Dubai, that would be the East. If it's parked in London, that would be the West.
00:02:10.253 - 00:02:12.141, Speaker A: Cool. Cindy.
00:02:12.293 - 00:02:33.535, Speaker C: Hi everyone. I am Cindy. I'm the co founder of Drift. This has me as the founder of Drip. I am not the founder of Drip, it's Drift. We're the leading defi platform on Solana with the largest perpetuals exchange and borrow land as well as Spot. Most recently we just launched prediction markets on top of our integrated pool of collateral.
00:02:33.535 - 00:03:21.945, Speaker C: So we've been deep and building in the solana space since 2021. I am debating on the eastern crypto does crypto. Eastern crypto does crypto better than the western crypto? Because I'm Malaysian Chinese, grew up in Malaysia and spent most of my career in the east as well. Used to work in Korea and Shanghai and my career in crypto has been since 2017. I was a trader in the past, so largely trading on centralized Asian exchanges such as OkX Finance, etc. So I'll be debating on this side today. And in terms of the definition, agree with you there, I think we should define it as Eastern versus Western hemisphere.
00:03:21.945 - 00:03:27.609, Speaker C: We don't need to go into two deep philosophy today. That's out of scope. But we're excited to get started.
00:03:27.777 - 00:03:55.705, Speaker A: Yeah. And the reason why I'm just standing in between. So I spent my first 18 years in mainland China and moved to US for the past decade. And then my crypto story is also a very interesting east versus west as well. Because when I was having my first job at ebay and I was a product manager, so my manager asked me to do research around the auto Marketplace. That was 2012. That's when I figure out Sucro.
00:03:55.705 - 00:04:37.213, Speaker A: And then so I asked my Asian parents because they all want me to buy houses in San Francisco how I can move the money out of China. It's impossible. It's like capital control. Everyone can only move 50k. And so I asked my mom, what about we use this bitcoin thing. So my mom now is not very happy because I wish you have held onto those bitcoin instead of my housing Noe Valley in San Francisco. So I think probably the next question gonna be for Cindy, because Cindy as a Eastern founder and then so you are flying in between New York and KL now.
00:04:37.213 - 00:04:58.715, Speaker A: So being an investor in drift, I know that drift is also very like Western or like, or probably like global focus. Like when it comes to like traders and like users acquisition and like can you share a little bit more that? Because like so if the assumption is like east has like more users and then so why you guys are focused on like New York?
00:04:59.575 - 00:05:49.057, Speaker C: Yeah, I think two things, and that's the core of our argument today is that a lot of the capital markets that are more mature happens to be in the, in the west. And the capital mature markets creates opportunities for zero to one type of innovation. Which is why the founders of Solana, founders of Ethereum, are largely Western based. But distribution focuses largely on the East. And there are two things that the east does better, which is from the outflow of the initial innovations from the west, the east does distribution, I would say 100 times better due to two things. Like one is necessity. We talked about capital controls in Asia and a lot of these are the reason that I got into crypto in the first place.
00:05:49.057 - 00:06:50.255, Speaker C: Growing up in Malaysia, there's a lot of rampant capital controls. Can't even take 10 to 100k out without being flagged. So crypto provides a very Natural use case specifically stablecoins like USDT and USCC are very rampant in Asia versus the West. Second is very flourishing developer ecosystem in Asia. So our team, we're about 30 now, we recently just announced a funding round to expand our team to 50 people. We're quite split between east and west and we kind of followed the similar structure of a lot of the early innovations of crypto companies where we started off building our technology with Western developers and Western researchers. But when it came to distribution and growing the technology, all of our most recent hires in the last year were from the East.
00:06:50.255 - 00:07:00.405, Speaker C: So Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore. And this sort of shows the evolution over time. Distribution happens in the east, but innovation largely happens in the West.
00:07:00.785 - 00:07:07.081, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think the question for Joanna then going to be. And yeah, can I challenge that a little bit? Yeah, sure.
00:07:07.233 - 00:07:36.755, Speaker B: So I think going back to the point like wide West. Right. So superior education and immigration policies. Right. Allows these western educated Eastern founders to stay in the U.S. right. So maybe just to go back to the question, why Cindy, are you moving? And I know David, your co founder, moving to New York as opposed to staying in kl, right? Maybe because you thought about, you know, you get better coffee and wi fi.
00:07:37.775 - 00:08:17.685, Speaker C: Maybe that's it. Well, I think that going back to the dichotomy of this question, like I think we all agree here that crypto is inherently global and to focus on east versus west is a new question. Well, we're here today so we can talk about it, but I do think that a combination of the best of both is the best way to operate here. For founders that need to fundraise, raise capital, I think being in the US is definitely the right decision. And having stricter regulations in the US also makes it more difficult for a founder to scale their company. So starting out, raising capital in the US is great. Capital markets are awesome, a lot of money.
00:08:17.685 - 00:08:28.145, Speaker C: There's. But as you're going into expansion mode, I think that the real users are in Asia. The real scale of developer ecosystem is in Asia.
00:08:29.245 - 00:08:52.789, Speaker A: Yeah. So for like Joanna and Enzo, now you guys are building. So now you are building a generic developer platform and also going to bring on more application. And then you were at optimism as well. So the story for optimism. So I still remember clearly being an early investor in the optimism. And they're looking for non financial application like they cannot like back in the day.
00:08:52.789 - 00:09:22.495, Speaker A: So like back in the day there were not many non financial application in so in like us. And so they have to come to Asia, Vietnam and then just look for like gaming company and like Game five founders, right. And then so then the question is like if west have enough users and so why we have seen from like past cycles and most of these applications like Stepan, like Access Infinity and so none of the founders or like markets are ever started in the West.
00:09:23.635 - 00:09:48.777, Speaker B: Well there are more than 60% of the world population in Asia. So if we don't onboard more users it's kind of freaking embarrassing. Right. Jokes aside, basically I think it comes down to two things. One is viral marketing which is something that Asian founders marketers just do really well. Something to. Yeah, as you mentioned, right.
00:09:48.777 - 00:10:57.273, Speaker B: Stepan and Axie Infinity all have done this before and actually with Vichai Web 2 company in China, you know they basically pioneered this mini games on phone and now Tang is kind of stealing the idea and make it a thing. Right. That I think western companies just very much better at building narratives. So yeah. So basically going back to why you see more gamefi companies being founded in Asia, I think it kind of goes back to your point actually Cindy, you said the fact that it's not as advanced economies here, so people are touched by crypto in a meaningful way. So what I mean by that is you guys were all here at the brief point yesterday at the awards winning the roast I would call it. One quote I remember is we all love referee gaming, also known as the Indonesian or Filipino basic income.
00:10:57.273 - 00:11:02.325, Speaker B: So people really care going into crypto is life changing for them.
00:11:02.915 - 00:11:34.315, Speaker A: Yeah. And so like I think that the clear like division when it comes to east and west and then so that's I center around stablecoin and so here like if you ask anyone here like most of the users like on the ground. So like Singapore is not very Southeast Asian. So like we have to admit that like Singapore is more closer to the developed by the west world. Right. And if you go to Philippines, if you go to Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Taiwan and is that everything is tethered like usdt. Right.
00:11:34.315 - 00:11:56.481, Speaker A: And so like there's a very interesting number that. So if we look at the on chain. So if we. So if we look at the wallet overlap between USDC and USDT, like guess what the number is, it's 2.8% right. So like everyone in US like use Circle, Coinbase and like USDC. But like the distribution is not just happening here.
00:11:56.481 - 00:12:33.753, Speaker A: And so and I think we have this a very interesting offshore and onshore like economy. And so then like the question probably for both sides and like it seems like the stablecoin becoming this like shadow Dollar play and like neo banking play but like this. But like the stable coin distribution is a highly, highly separated. Right. And then so probably for like stingdy because you guys have to onboard USDC like USDT and like all the stablecoin as I cleverized. Yeah. So like how, so how do you see that distribution like being like so sparse out.
00:12:33.753 - 00:12:35.705, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:12:35.865 - 00:13:13.739, Speaker C: I think the stablecoin it's important to talk about what people are using the stablecoins for as well. One is trading people don't want to denominate re nominate in fiat once they've entered the crypto excuse. So it's very important to build on chain economies around supporting different stablecoins. So drift. For example, we have a cross collateral system and we enable, I think we're the only dexs that do this. We enable multiple sources of stablecoin collateral to be used as collateral. So USCC is actually by and large or larger larger pool as is on Solana.
00:13:13.739 - 00:14:08.175, Speaker C: USDT is about maybe like 10% of USCC right now. But that tells you the bifurcation of the users within Solana ecosystem. I think the users are currently still very much more on the western side. When you compare it to something like Tron which is a very clearly eastern focused chain, I think The USDT emissions versus USDT are like 100 to 1. So for us as a defi protocol it's very important to build port and rails around both sides so that western users and eastern users can allow for both. But you know, when we look at trading volume, even though the USCT volume is 10% of USCC, the trading volumes generated on the eastern side are much higher than in the West. So these people are clearly using USCT to do a lot of trades as well, not just as a form of payments.
00:14:09.205 - 00:14:12.533, Speaker A: So for Joanna, given your experience, can.
00:14:12.549 - 00:15:01.715, Speaker B: I go back to that question and answer that? Yeah, I think it's a really good point. Right. Like why do we see very small overlap between USDT usdc? A lot of this has to do with not just perception but the reality of the west being more compliant. Right. So you know, the kind of general consensus is that you know, the let's just use Coinbase and Binance example, right. You know the Coinbase, it's a lot more compliant and you know, you have to pay 30% tax by trading and reporting tax on top of it. And my dev rel guy would tell me in India people actually still prefer to use Coinbase even though Binance is much larger market cap and much larger trading volume there.
00:15:01.715 - 00:15:30.585, Speaker B: And the reason is because the local banks will close your accounts if it's linked to Binance crypto because they think it's again could be perception but also high likelihood of, you know, nefarious crypto activities happening. So people would rather just pay that extra money to be on Coinbase just to make sure that their assets not going to be taken away. And that's a big deal because we Asians are very cheap.
00:15:31.685 - 00:16:10.725, Speaker A: Yeah. So join. Just given your experience at Coinbase before and so thinking about the distribution, right, so now you're building a platform and then so are you going to repurpose some of the prior distribution techniques from Coinbase? Because Coinbase, as you said, it's highly compliant. But the thing is that when it comes to emerging markets and so Coinbase so far does not have a relatively good distribution so far. And then so when it comes to soon and then. So have you guys think about the actual user distribution plan?
00:16:10.805 - 00:16:45.459, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So just by maybe starting with my team. Right. So I am one of the two only people that's actually sitting in the west. So even though I guess we are by definition a western company, but we're actually very much deeply rooted in the east. And all my developers are actually Chinese because they're just as good as the Bay Area developers and I pay them one third of the salary and everyone's still happy. That's a joke.
00:16:45.459 - 00:17:16.746, Speaker B: But it's true. But yeah, just to come back on the user side because we have these people that's on the ground very much deeply rooted in the local communities and we know where the developers are. The good developers are especially we are absolutely focusing on the emerging market side, especially the apac. So we're on a mission to elevate these emerging market developers because we believe the next wave of high quality developers going to come from.
00:17:16.890 - 00:17:33.042, Speaker A: Yep. I think like this also leads to like the next argument like if like west has attacked. Right. And why all the developers are Chinese and like Ethan developer and I think for Cindy as well, most of most of your developer are in kl, right?
00:17:33.138 - 00:17:34.538, Speaker C: Half. Half mostly.
00:17:34.666 - 00:18:12.895, Speaker A: So like if we look at the actual developer onboarding and I think the thing is, okay, at a very, very high level, most of this frontier crypto publication like indeed like coming from the west because of the brains and the professors are still in like us college whatnot. Right. But like the actual developer like who are making things happen, it seems like to be all like Ethan developers. So like Joanna, do you want to start with that? So like have you seen the developer like quality or like their different lifestyle or like working style. So, like, why you guys eventually land on having most of like eastern developers?
00:18:13.235 - 00:18:46.523, Speaker B: Because the eastern developers, they work hard and they deliver fast. Right. So take ourselves example, right? We basically launched the test, the DevNet, within three months. And TestNet, we're actually, I guess, alpha for everybody. We're going to announce that next week. And you know, the whole process took about five months compared to maybe some of the other SBM projects that been doing research for years and barely delivers. So, you know, it have a lot more Runway, right.
00:18:46.523 - 00:19:28.725, Speaker B: With also less kind of a burn rate when it comes to cost. So I think in general, just, you know, being able to tap into the talent pool here is really important. And we, you know, going back to my point, right, we were all about getting the developers onboarded in this, in this part of the region. And the other thing, I want to actually give Cindy a shout out, I think, you know, drift, right? These are the great examples, like what inspired us about why we wanted to, you know, inspire. We wanted to onboard these next wave of high quality dapps that can actually track users from both west and east.
00:19:29.305 - 00:20:06.835, Speaker C: Yeah. I think to wrap up, a lot of the users are in the east, a lot of the innovation happens in the west. But you know, when you look at Binance with 200 million wallets, when you look at Korea, one in five Koreans have a centralized exchange account versus just how many mil in coinbase. Right. Like a lot of the speculation, payments and necessity for crypto happens in the east alongside the ease and accessibility of developers here. But combining that with the innovation and the capital markets to the west is where we want to be. And I think both our companies are positioned in that way.
00:20:07.215 - 00:20:10.799, Speaker A: Joanna, I want to give. You want to give us closing remarks?
00:20:10.887 - 00:20:23.307, Speaker B: Yeah. The closing thought is it doesn't matter if it's east versus West. That division is all very arbitrary. Right. We're in crypto for a reason. We're here for decentralization. And, you know, that transcends borders.
00:20:23.307 - 00:20:40.655, Speaker B: And at the end of the day, we're here as unifiers now. Dividers, right? We're all here, you know, coming from the west and east into Breakpoint. Maybe we don't win a Lambo or, you know, even spot one of the three Lambos that Cindy fought over. But we're all here for fun.
00:20:41.115 - 00:20:58.189, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone. Like, thank you to beautiful ladies. And so I hope that, like, we crypto people can be completely meta, solvent, apolitical and because I think like, after Covid, like there's only one consensus that can be easily generated. It's like we all deserve better government. Okay, thank you, everyone.
00:20:58.357 - 00:20:58.765, Speaker B: Thank you.
