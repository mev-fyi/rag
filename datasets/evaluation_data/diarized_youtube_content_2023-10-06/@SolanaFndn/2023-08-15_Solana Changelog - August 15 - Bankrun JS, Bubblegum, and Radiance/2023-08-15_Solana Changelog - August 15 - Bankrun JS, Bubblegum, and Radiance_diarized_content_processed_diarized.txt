00:00:00.680 - 00:00:10.434, Speaker A: GM welcome. Welcome to this new episode of the Solana Changelog, where we talk about all of the latest developer updates over the past weeks. So, Jonas, kick us off.
00:00:10.894 - 00:00:35.460, Speaker B: Yeah. So what happened this week is the game jam ended and there were Uber over 230 registrations and 22 submitted games. Many of them were completely on chain games and all of them had some Solana integration. So that was super exciting. Magicblock did a great job there together with Lampert Dao and I hope there will be another one.
00:00:35.612 - 00:00:50.064, Speaker A: Yeah, it was really cool to see like just even like the quality of games that were developed. I believe it was like over five days and I'm just thinking if people had like longer time, I can just only imagine like what kind of stuff that they'll be able to do. So it's really cool.
00:00:50.404 - 00:01:23.152, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Compared to other game jams, it's actually quite long, five days. Many of them are only like over a weekend or something. But since it's just still super hard to build stuff like a complete game on Solana, it was a bit more time, but I think the tooling improved a lot. By the way, during the game jam, like there's now flutter SDK, there is a godot engine, there is a rust and native compiled in the browser. Unity SDK improved a lot. The Unreal SDK was updated, so even if it was only for the new tooling, it was already a success.
00:01:23.152 - 00:01:26.024, Speaker B: But also so many great games. It's amazing.
00:01:26.184 - 00:01:34.544, Speaker A: That's so cool. So I guess we'll kind of like see more games, I guess, in like the upcoming hackathons as well. Thanks to all of that new developer tooling. Cool.
00:01:34.704 - 00:01:37.616, Speaker B: Another thing that helps developers onboarding, right?
00:01:37.720 - 00:01:40.504, Speaker A: Oh, the developer educator program.
00:01:40.664 - 00:01:41.120, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:41.192 - 00:02:07.320, Speaker A: This is so cool. And I'm really excited to see this kick off. So essentially, if you want to run a solution workshop in your local city or in your uni, you can actually get trained by the developer relations team on how to conduct a workshop. So this is really cool. And I believe it kicks off the week beginning of August 14. So click on the link below to sign up for that. And it's amazing.
00:02:07.320 - 00:02:19.034, Speaker A: And I believe there's also you can get paid up to 250 USD for conducting a workshop in your city or university. So definitely check that out.
00:02:19.334 - 00:02:33.246, Speaker B: Oh, that's nice. Maybe I should do a workshop. And it's also led by Jacob Creech, who is extremely clever. So yeah, make sure to sign up. It's gonna be great. Yeah. Then next, here's a commit that we found, right? Yeah.
00:02:33.270 - 00:03:13.774, Speaker A: So this one is SIMD 0059, which is to add receipt route to gossip. And this is actually just building up of the work of having lite clients. So they came up with the concept of having something called a transaction receipt. And again, this is just to follow on from that so that the receipt routes can be stored so that you'll be, so the like clients will be able to verify that transaction has happened without necessarily having to trust the RPC providers. So this is really cool. Tons of work being done to kind of support liteclan on Solana. So check out this particular SIMD.
00:03:14.214 - 00:03:18.354, Speaker B: Yeah, that's really interesting. Where these receipts saved.
00:03:21.694 - 00:03:33.434, Speaker A: I can't remember the exact details of where exactly they're saved, but I believe if you go to sIMD 58, that's where it gives more details on the particular receipts.
00:03:34.214 - 00:03:56.654, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, there's also lots of text here maybe I should read. I really want to understand that. But I found another really cool thing. The bubblegum program. Like you might have heard of compressed nfts on Solana, right? And the bubblegum program now, which is mostly used for that, has a new update and some extremely beautiful documentation. I must say, it really looks great.
00:03:56.654 - 00:04:24.064, Speaker B: So definitely check this out. And I also saw a branch which had updatable compressed nfts. So this will of course like open a whole bunch of new possibilities, like especially for games when you want to update your metadata, for example. Yep. Before you had like to use some kind of hex, like maybe point to an API or just mint a new one since it was really cheap. Still possible, but updated with c nfts of course. Even better.
00:04:24.064 - 00:04:32.904, Speaker B: Yeah, here it says it even like coming soon. So yeah, keep your eyes open for that and just look at this beautiful documentation.
00:04:33.364 - 00:05:18.850, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I guess compressed nfts have like literally taken the developer ecosystem by storm and having good better documentation for it can only be more helpful. So definitely check those out. Then over to resources of the week. The first one we have is radiance by the fire dancer team, and I have to admit this one actually goes over my head, but it was just really cool to see. So this is a Solana protocol modules written in Google. And I guess this is to kind of like aid the development of the new validator client. So it's kind of like really cool to see how it works and how things are coming along.
00:05:18.850 - 00:05:25.322, Speaker A: So definitely check that out, especially if you are a go developer and see what's going on in that particular repo.
00:05:25.458 - 00:06:04.310, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds very interesting. Another thing I found for, especially when you do a lot locally, there's a super local validator. Now, basically, that's how I call it. It's called bank run, and it gives you a bunch of new possibilities. For example, what I find super exciting is that you now will be able to also interact with the time in the validator, because before I was working with games a lot and I had buildings and they have an upgrade time. And of course, it's very difficult to test these things if you can't change the time. And on your local validator, it would be like roughly always the same system time as you currently have.
00:06:04.310 - 00:06:12.734, Speaker B: But with this thing, you can now also write tests which change the time and lots of other things. So check it out.
00:06:12.774 - 00:06:50.342, Speaker A: Interesting. And I guess I kind of really like to see innovations happen on the local development side because it kind of reduces the issues of having Sol to deploy your programs on Devnet. We know that's a problem. Hopefully will continue to get addressed. Yeah, but also just like having good software development practices of testing locally before you ship to Mainnet, because I know Solana developers like to test on Mainnet. So the better that the local development becomes, the kind of like. Yeah, the more possibilities that you have to test extensively on your local environment.
00:06:50.342 - 00:06:51.742, Speaker A: So really good to see that.
00:06:51.838 - 00:07:09.558, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm also a victim of that sometimes because there are just a bunch of programs which you don't have locally, and then the easiest is just use Defnet. And if it's not there, then you use mainnet. So I mean, there are ways around it. Yeah, hopefully this helps with it as well a little bit, for sure.
00:07:09.726 - 00:07:34.144, Speaker A: And that brings us to the end of this episode of the Solana Changelog. Join us next week to hear again more about the upcoming developments. Just final couple plugs. We did release our bootcamp videos for the Solana Pirate series, so definitely check that out on the YouTube channel. And also, don't forget to be active on the Solana Stack exchange.
00:07:34.444 - 00:07:42.084, Speaker B: Yes, stack exchange. Very cool, very important. So they get some points for free for sure.
00:07:42.204 - 00:07:42.924, Speaker A: Yep. So join.
