00:00:03.640 - 00:00:26.554, Speaker A: All right, cozy, small room. Hi to everyone. My favorite people are in the room. And those of you watching on YouTube, hello to YouTube. So the utility for nfts, is it in the room with us right now? Right. So as the market starts to come back 50% up just on NFT trading volume last month, I think this is a good question. This is very topical.
00:00:26.554 - 00:01:02.714, Speaker A: To start things off, what makes nfts nfts? Four things, right? So, transparency, indivisibility, transferability, interoperability. This is what makes them unique. And their uses can be broadly in two buckets. Secular or broad? When I say secular, these are limited to ecosystem or NFT projects. When I say broad, these are applications for humanity at large. So secular could be staking exclusivity, redeemable benefits, stuff like that. Broad are large human applications.
00:01:02.714 - 00:01:30.988, Speaker A: So these could be ticketing, voting, real estate, ip authentication. That's phase two. We're right now in phase one, which is the secular, ecosystem specific use cases. So how do we move to. Phase two is sort of function of tech, and with that will come the adoption. So where are we in terms of tech? This is. I'm trying to move the slide.
00:01:30.988 - 00:02:01.394, Speaker A: Yes. So this is where web two tech curve has evolved. By that, I mean there is a constant handshake of app and infrastructure. So this app infrastructure cycle constantly moves on as the apps develop. It breeds the need for infrastructure, which inspire few apps. And there is a time for everything. Because YouTube could not happen in 1995, it had to happen in 2005, because broadband had to develop in two thousands for that.
00:02:01.394 - 00:02:52.614, Speaker A: This is essentially what Danny Grant and Ross Griezmann came up with us, we, about five years ago with the paper called myth of infrastructure cycle. This is universal. So where are we in terms of web? Three, lots of l one s, l two s, roll ups, cks, wallets, browsers, extension. But really, where are the apps? Where are the users? And when we develop a lot of infrastructure, divorced from apps and divorced from use cases, we have sort of barren lands. And this is what we want to avoid. This is something that has happened across beyond tech cycles as well. So we've had a lot of aeroplanes, which then inspired the need for airports, which is infrastructure.
00:02:52.614 - 00:04:10.106, Speaker A: We have had a lot of electric bulbs developed first, which then inspired the need for large scale electric grids in crypto, in web3, where we are at that very juncture, where we have lots and lots of infrastructure, but we need the apps. And this is my lovely friends, where NFTs come in. So NFTs enable apps and adoption because this is a new game and it's got new rules. With simple tools done right daily, such as content, virality, engagement, NFTs can enable adoption like no other. Some of the best crypto founders web3 people you see on Twitter are not Kols, but actually the founders running the projects themselves. So a little bit more in terms of my mental model, the way I look at it is that the first wave of web3 was largely designed around the fungible tokens. So all of the games were the core asset value accrual came back to their fungible tokens.
00:04:10.106 - 00:05:11.710, Speaker A: Then came the next wave, perhaps, which was sort of a blend of NFts and fungible tokens together. And we're gradually shifting to a place where the top designer, where if you remember in the nineties, early nineties, the top game designers would give away, would put a banner on top of their websites and would actually raffle ipods to the players. You know what, NFT giveaways and NFT raffles are not very far from that. So we are coming to that phase, that third phase where we come to a sort of NFT factory model. So a little bit more on that. But first, this is how my mental model has evolved, very simply from web one, web two, to web3. So which is where we have tools of NFTs powered with what is happening with AI across the space.
00:05:11.710 - 00:06:06.098, Speaker A: This is something we've used in our own products and platforms as well as I'll double click on in a minute, especially with our NFT platform more and our AIGC tool. So now how all of this theory translates into action from ourselves, ourselves being find Satoshi lab into our products is as follows. So the first point of contact is bells and whistles, of course. Gas hero. We believe gaming is going to be one of the major adoption reasons for people to come on web3 rails. And for gaming in web3, NFTs are going to be not just a feature, but the future. This is where our new game called Gas Hero will play.
00:06:06.098 - 00:06:47.932, Speaker A: It's at the intersection of social, web3 and strategy. We've learned a few things from our power apps, Stepan on how to make the economy sustainable by fixing asset surplus, on how to include social gameplay, which is very important. And third and most importantly perhaps how to improve the game experience itself. And a little bit of alpha. We've just rolled out or started the community testing. There are about 3000 spots, so please do check out our Twitter asshero official on more details on how to find a spot to test the new game. The second one is more.
00:06:47.932 - 00:07:17.768, Speaker A: It's an NFT platform. So the way we think of FSL is a combination of front end and back end applications. The front end applications are the ones that face the users, the consumers, which is where we have steps. Step in, in lifestyle space, which is where we have gas hero in gaming space. And there is something coming up on social space. Next year, on the backend space, we build infrastructure to support these front end apps. So we've got our own Dex, which is called door, and we've got our own marketplace, which is called more.
00:07:17.768 - 00:08:00.604, Speaker A: This is where we want to power and support artists, art, all kinds of creators, retail as well, not just Wales. And we believe, therefore, NFT culture is entertainment, and entertainment is a killer feature. Speculation is not just a bug, but a feature here, last but not the least is of course, Stepn. I often say that our digital sneakers got people moving way more than even physical sneakers. And I've spoken to people at Nike and Adidas. So, yeah, cheers to Stepn. And while we are talking of innovation and how stepn got real utility to NFTs, there is stuff happening.
00:08:00.604 - 00:08:50.022, Speaker A: Yes, albeit in small numbers. So whether it's in music with Rihanna, whether it's in ticketing with Coachella, whether it's virtual fashion with artifact and Nike, whether it's physical art, and who's not heard of banksy or fundraising or education, where universities are putting the degrees on nfts? Or in fact, I heard in India, in a state where even the police complaints were being put on nfts to avoid corruption. So, yeah, there are stuff happening from LVMH to these small scale initiatives, which soon will find broad applications. I mean, that's how Internet started with TCP, I being a small defense lab. And today, the penetration is close to 90%. Talking of penetration and adoption, yeah, everybody's feeling a little bit glum till a few weeks ago, of course. Not Solana community anymore.
00:08:50.022 - 00:09:38.284, Speaker A: Yeah, we love the price action, of course, but, yeah. So if you zoom out a little bit, the market, the famous four year cycle is not just true for price action, but it's true for key indicators and activities and metrics. So the four special ones are the market cap, media activity, developer activity, and startup activity. And if you look at these numbers, especially the dev activity across four years, not just double digit growth, but 84%, I think this is the picture that matters. So please, please, please. Innovator stage innovation. Solana for devs and builders, builders of all, of all the people, builders are the ones who should not be discouraged by markets, by highs and lows.
00:09:38.284 - 00:10:09.264, Speaker A: I was just actually debating with one of the senior people here. And market cycles are true to humanity, to human nature. What goes up must come down. What is down must go up. Whether it's automotive industry, whether it's financial industry, whether it's any industry, whether it's geopolitics, whether it's countries, whether it's wars, whether it's life itself. Life and death. Cyclo is a fact of life and history, time and again has taught us crypto is just a blip on the horizon, just a drop in the ocean.
00:10:09.264 - 00:10:26.820, Speaker A: So cycle is, if it's cyclical, it's true, it's good. That means it's not pumped up, that means it's not fake, that means it's organic. So let's embrace the cycle. What is truly heartening is that despite all these cycles, there are just double digit growth. Looking forward to us. So let's build. Let's get prepped up.
00:10:26.820 - 00:11:03.672, Speaker A: Let's build utility, let's build sustainability for things that are going to last. So, what to build? As you can see, we believe we're betting on the fact that crypto's consumer moment is coming. Yes, it may take time, but we need to build. So whether it's gaming, virtual worlds, messaging, fitness, education, collectibles, fintech shopping, most of the apps either are going from web two to web 2.5 model or dipping their toes in web3. So Sugartown, for example, with their free months already, I think the last they minted 3200 ETH. So about $5 million.
00:11:03.672 - 00:11:35.738, Speaker A: Not bad for a freeman. That's a game from Zyngai, right? So if AAA games are entering and doing so well, that's good. That's not competition, that's expansion. That's what we need. And that means that people are paying attention and not to mention, of course, Blackrock and the liquidity these guys are going to bring. So with that being said, if crypto's consumer moment is coming, are you guys ready? Because we at FSL are. This is our suite of portfolio with Stepn, with our Dex door, with our NFT marketplace.
00:11:35.738 - 00:11:59.294, Speaker A: Fairmint is our retail platform. On more for creators, Smack is our AI powered anti cheat tool. Yes, here is, of course, a star game, wait for it, in December. It's already breaking records in Polygon. It's more than the volumes are more than top five collections put together. And last but not the least, GNT, our AIGC tool. So yes, we are ready.
00:11:59.294 - 00:12:02.046, Speaker A: Thank you for listening here. Cheers. Bye.
