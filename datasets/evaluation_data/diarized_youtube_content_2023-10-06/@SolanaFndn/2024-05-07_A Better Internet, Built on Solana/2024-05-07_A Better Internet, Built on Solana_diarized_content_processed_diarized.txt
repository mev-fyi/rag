00:00:00.280 - 00:00:13.194, Speaker C: My belief is the user experience of the Internet is broken. Solana is really the foundation of a new Internet, one that is owned by the people. I think that we are going to be a part of the solution to that. The Internet will never be the same again.
00:00:14.254 - 00:00:32.450, Speaker B: Decaf is only possible on Solana. We were trying to onboard the next billion people into Solana. We allow them to have access to a stable currency such as USDC. They are able to protect themselves from this horrible inflation and then have money to actually live their lives.
00:00:32.642 - 00:00:40.562, Speaker A: Helium's building wireless networks. As the helium network grows we need the blockchain that's underlying to also grow with it and Solana is the only real option.
00:00:40.618 - 00:00:41.906, Speaker UNK: And when we're thinking about not just.
00:00:41.930 - 00:00:46.130, Speaker A: The coordination, the scalability but what does that experience look like for the average user?
00:00:46.202 - 00:00:49.066, Speaker UNK: It needs to be intuitive, it needs to be fast, needs to be simple.
00:00:49.130 - 00:00:49.962, Speaker A: And Solana.
00:00:50.018 - 00:00:52.394, Speaker UNK: Truly is the only blockchain that can power those types of interfaces.
