00:00:03.760 - 00:00:04.168, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:00:04.198 - 00:00:04.838, Speaker B: It's massive.
00:00:04.886 - 00:00:23.534, Speaker A: Good afternoon, everybody. Excited to talk about the future of fintech. I am Ben Mills, I'm the co founder of Mezzo. Mezzo is infrastructure to make it really easy to move money between blockchains and bank accounts. And today I'm joined by an awesome panel that I will let introduce themselves. Guerra, do you want to start?
00:00:23.614 - 00:00:40.834, Speaker B: Yeah. Hi, so I'm Guerra Kiwana, the head of crypto. Also another title, the founder and residence of crypto at a traditional payments company called Onafric. We recently rebranded so those who may know the african payments ecosystem. Our name was previously MfS Africa. So yeah, that's a bit about me. Go ahead.
00:00:40.914 - 00:01:18.194, Speaker C: Hey, I'm George Stella, I'm the founder of Big Token. I come from the advertising side of the world. So I've been in advertising for over 30 years. I'm probably the senior member of the crew up here. Was in tv advertising way back in the day and then cable advertising and then in 1998 moved over to the Internet advertising side and was with the first for twelve years, first company that developed ad serving technology for web publishers. We created behavioral targeting and cookie targeting in the first demand side platform. So you're welcome on the cookie targeting stuff.
00:01:18.194 - 00:01:25.394, Speaker C: And now launched big token and embracing web3 for ad tech.
00:01:26.994 - 00:01:52.174, Speaker D: My name is Ian, I'm the co founder CEO of Tiplink. My background comes from kind of traditional finance. Worked at Goldman Sachs for a couple of years as a program trader, was at Citadel as a quant trader, quant portfolio manager, was there for six years, quit about a year and a half ago to start Tiplink. And hopefully some of you have gotten some of the activations of Tiplink here. But the idea is pretty simple. You can send crypto or nfts to anyone with a link. If they have a wallet, they can withdraw it there.
00:01:52.174 - 00:01:58.558, Speaker D: If they don't have a wallet, they can just log in with Google and that becomes their crypto wallet. And super excited to be talking to some fintech today.
00:01:58.686 - 00:01:59.206, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:01:59.310 - 00:02:34.334, Speaker B: But I'll just quickly, briefly introduce our, introduce what we do. So MfS Africa, also now known as Ona Freak, is Africa's largest payments hub. So we are present in 40 countries and do everything from moving money in out of Africa as well as around Africa, specializing in mobile money. So interoperability of mobile money networks. So traditionally we've done a great job of building the foundation of payments in Africa, but now we're looking at integrating and using stablecoin, specifically in crypto to go to the next level. My background has been in building banks and fintech and general payments.
00:02:34.834 - 00:02:54.018, Speaker A: Great. Well, to start, we thought it might make sense to really understand where we're at today in fintech. So I'd love to hear from each of you about, as you see it, what are the big unsolved problems in fintech today? And then we'll kind of dig into how crypto might be a solution. Guerra do you want to start?
00:02:54.106 - 00:03:33.884, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's a big question. What are the big problems in fintech? What's causing us headaches? So I'm going to speak from the african perspective. So, Africa, fastest growing continent, youngest population, highest adoption of technology in general, but highly fragmented ecosystem. Like I said, 54 countries, minimum of 54 different regulators to deal with. And companies like us have done a great job of getting licenses and actually putting a patchwork of a network together to work in these spaces. So I think the biggest problem in Africa, at least right now, is the hyper fragmentation.
00:03:33.884 - 00:04:16.504, Speaker B: You go from border to border, Kenya to Uganda, is wildly, vastly different. But there's a lot of excitement and intent. Interest in trade between these two corridors, between these corridors and digital payments has done a great job to get us to a point where there's financial inclusion. And Africa in general, we're seeing a lot of financial inclusion, but we really need to get to that next level of solving for hyper fragmentation and really accessibility to modern payment systems to get to financial freedom. So we're included. Now, all the papers that are being written by the UN, whoever, they talk about Africans being not included, we're included. There's a lot of penetration of financial services across the continent.
00:04:16.504 - 00:04:20.052, Speaker B: Now, what do we do with it is the biggest challenge that we're seeing.
00:04:20.188 - 00:04:22.036, Speaker A: Awesome. Great. George.
00:04:22.180 - 00:05:10.598, Speaker C: From speaking from the data monetization side, the advertising side, I think one of the big challenges is the opportunities that can be embraced around all of this really deep data that fintech companies have on their users and their customers, and how big of an opportunity that is for these companies to actually be able to monetize that data. But because the data is so sensitive, you know, it really poses a lot of risk. There's minefields of liability issues out there that need to be figured out. I think web, three wallets and smart contracts and things like that can be a huge, a huge way to solve those problems.
00:05:10.686 - 00:05:12.114, Speaker A: Absolutely awesome.
00:05:12.494 - 00:05:43.092, Speaker D: So, for me, the best way to illustrate the pain points in fintech is kind of the origin story of why we started tiplink, and it had nothing to do with crypto at all. So my co founder Sheikh and I, we had built a bunch of stuff outside of work for fun. We built this thing that would predict what content on the Internet would go viral. And we popped it into an Instagram account and later, a TikTok account. And we were growing this account, and we did a simple giveaway. The goal was like, hey, let's just give $10 to someone who wins. I messaged this lady, like, hey, you want $10 to use PayPal? And it took her literally two days to respond.
00:05:43.092 - 00:06:01.888, Speaker D: She says, no, I use venmo. I was like, cool, what's your venmo? It took her another two days to respond. She was like, I'm not telling you my venmo. And I was like, I want to give you $10. Why is this so hard? And that was the first time we were like, man, it'd be nice to just send money with a link. In the same way, when I hand you cash, I don't ask you what platform you use. I don't ask you what your username is.
00:06:01.888 - 00:06:31.364, Speaker D: I just hand you this thing. So a little bit later, we built another project. It was like Reddit, but if you make it to the front page, you get paid real money. And accepting money on the Internet with Stripe and PayPal is super easy. But paying out money to users across the globe when everyone uses different platforms, when everyone has user names across these platforms, really, really difficult. So again, we're like, man, it'd be really nice to just send money with a link over, maybe email to all of these people. And we couldn't figure out a way to build this in traditional finance.
00:06:31.364 - 00:06:38.012, Speaker D: And really, Crypto was the only way that we could figure out how to even make this product. But that was a major pain point. That's just a fintech problem itself.
00:06:38.188 - 00:07:15.836, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think what strikes me is, like, this similar theme I'm hearing across all you is it's like the complexity of all these disjointed systems. And in many ways, I feel like it's only getting worse. I think that as more and more regulation happens, which is whether that's good or bad, it doesn't really matter. It's just complexity that you have to deal with. And, yeah, I think that's very interesting. Well, let's jump into crypto. I mean, I find almost everyone I talk to at conferences like this has a pretty interesting story of, like, how did they even get here and what brought them into crypto? So I'd love to hear from each of you, maybe.
00:07:15.836 - 00:07:19.684, Speaker A: George, do you want to start? What got you into crypto? What was your story, George?
00:07:19.724 - 00:08:16.446, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So going along the path of ad tech and consumer data, you know, a big token, we started to really understand that consumers had an appetite to start controlling and having more transparency and actually getting some value back for their data. So we launched big token originally as a way of what we call, like, the world's first data union. So a place where consumers can come and contribute data and earn value back for it. It had, like, a supply side and a demand side, and the consumers were earning points and the points were redeemed for cash, and it acted very much like a currency. And so this was in 2018, as crypto was kind of starting to explode. And so it just kind of made sense that we were attracted to that area.
00:08:16.446 - 00:08:34.124, Speaker C: Also, big stands for blockchain identification graph. So the original vision was always to, to move the very much web two mobile app that we developed into a web3 space, which we've just done. So that's really how I got into it.
00:08:34.204 - 00:08:34.772, Speaker A: Cool.
00:08:34.908 - 00:09:00.274, Speaker B: Where I was gifted bitcoin in 20, and I'm not going to say the year, did you buy pizza with it? You know what? I did a stupider thing. Well, not stupider. I essentially got gifted bitcoin for an unpaid internship I had. And this guy was like, do you want this thing? I feel bad that I'm not paying you. And I was like, sure, yeah. And he's like, and I think I could only buy drugs and guns at that time. And I kind of forgot about it.
00:09:00.274 - 00:09:25.050, Speaker B: Line went up and I cashed out, and I used that to actually found my first business, which was a cross border payments company between Canada and Kenya, Uganda. If I'd held onto it, that's another story. But you know what? The lessons I learned along the way were? Priceless. That's right. And, yeah. And kind of like, degenering in a very, like, under the surface fashion. Defi Summer was a lot of fun.
00:09:25.050 - 00:10:28.934, Speaker B: We were all at home, you know, during the pandemic and. But you know what? I don't have the heart for the line going up and down and chasing that, and now I don't have the time either. So after, you know, the crash, and actually, before that, I was also working at a fintech consultancy, and we, this is where we were building banks and doing a lot of stuff with payment services, regulators. And there was a time when a lot of our clients, who are traditional payments companies, you might even hear know of large payments companies coming to us and saying, hey, can you support us with our crypto strategy? And you know, my boss at the time gathered all the degens and he was like, I know you guys know this stuff. Let's figure out how to support our clients and on the other side as well. So crypto natives coming to us as well. So that was where I got a taste for, like, institutional crypto, and especially the crypto mullet thesis, which is fintech in the front, crypto powering the back and getting to work with crypto natives, crypto non natives regulators to help them understand this new technology.
00:10:28.934 - 00:11:03.346, Speaker B: And that's been my work trajectory, but also life wise, I split my time between Kenya and the UK. East Africa has whole horrible financial services. Sending money home is really difficult, very expensive, and also our currencies are devaluing at a ridiculous rate right now. So I've turned to stable coins for my family and my friends. I've encouraged them. I feel like I'm trying not to be like the ruja whatever her name was, the crypto queen, to get people into stable coins. But I found a lot of utility in that.
00:11:03.346 - 00:11:16.444, Speaker B: In my personal life. That's been my journey. It's kind of been like, it was really fun and exciting and so lucrative, and then scary and terrifying, and now it's like, okay, we're in a sustainable place. Yeah, awesome.
00:11:17.144 - 00:11:59.740, Speaker D: So for me, the first time I actually heard about bitcoin was in 2010, and I was a freshman in college, and this guy who was like, this libertarian came up to me and said, the whole world is about to implode. Every currency is going to be worth nothing, and we're going to all be using this thing called bitcoin. And at the time, I was just like, okay, it's a cool story sort of thing. And it's funny because a little bit later, this is in 2014 as well, I met this really bizarre dude who was working on something called Ethereum, and he asked me what I was doing and eventually told him I was going to be working in finance at a place like Goldman. And he started listing off dictators that were similar to Goldman. And I was like, what is going on? So I wanted nothing to do with that. And there was something very interesting in, like, the inside of these very fringe people that kind of brought this up.
00:11:59.740 - 00:12:30.646, Speaker D: And it's like, don't take investing advice from the person who tells you the moon's made of cheese or something, but there's something interesting about those fringe groups that are there. I ended up just really liking trading. So in college, for a very brief period of time, I was one of the biggest market makers on a betting site called in trade, where you can bet on the election. And that site ended up getting shut down. So this is in 2013. I was looking for something else that was fun to trade that wasn't like the stuff, stock market and bitcoin was there. And so back then, I ran with a buddy, like 24/7 bitcoin trading strategies.
00:12:30.646 - 00:12:49.442, Speaker D: I'd stay up all night. I'd have web scrapers call my phone when certain chinese news events were happening. They'd web scrape every Weibo account. And I got really into bitcoin then. And through that process, I actually started enjoying, actually crypto. And then, yeah, at Goldman and Citadel, I ended up being like the resident crypto nerd. I unsuccessfully convinced them to get into the businesses.
00:12:49.442 - 00:13:00.634, Speaker D: But, yeah, about a year and a half ago, when I told my boss, hey, I'm going to quit, I could see the anger that was building up. And then I was like, wait, wait, I'm about to do a crypto startup. And he's just like, all right, that makes sense.
00:13:00.674 - 00:13:01.294, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:01.634 - 00:13:07.178, Speaker D: So, yeah, just been in the space for forever, and, yeah, it's been a fun ride actually being in this full time.
00:13:07.226 - 00:13:26.006, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. Well, let's talk now about how can crypto help fintech and how ultimately can that help users. So I'd love to hear from each of you about how do you see crypto as a solution for a lot of these big problems that we talked about earlier. Guerra, do you want to start?
00:13:26.190 - 00:13:49.294, Speaker B: Yeah. Crypto is interesting in that it's the first time the global south and the global north received a technology, except for maybe Fhir at the same time. Right. It's the first time we've received an innovation at the same time. We're all innovating and building with it and on it at the same time. And we're seeing a divergence. Right.
00:13:49.294 - 00:14:49.464, Speaker B: In the global north, there's a lot of retail use is just mostly line go up, and institutional use is similar, but mostly treasury, boring stuff, settlement. But in the global south, we're seeing use cases for a need for stable coins and to solve for currency devaluation, also for cross border payments or remittances. So crypto is. It's great. I believe in crypto in general, cryptocurrencies, digital assets in general, because they're connecting a region that was previously left behind due to various reasons. Colonialism is a big reason, but we've received it at the same time as the rest of the world, and we're not seeing the same kinds of it's more collaborative, so there's more collaboration between the global north and global south, rather than exploitation. So previously it was quite exploitative, the relationship.
00:14:49.464 - 00:15:28.348, Speaker B: And with payments in general, we're seeing a lot of collaboration north and south, right? So remittances is a big, big, big one. Stablecoins entering the continent to solve for just digital money, right? Just giving people access to digital money in places where there's a huge need for us dollars, dollar liquidity is incredibly low, incredibly hard to find, but stablecoins, not so much. So what does it solve for? I mean, it solves for kind of equalizing the playing field globally, in my opinion. And I think we're still like 0.1% of the way there. Like, there's still so much left to do and see, but, yeah, awesome.
00:15:28.396 - 00:15:49.570, Speaker A: And do you, when you think about, you know, this is the technology that came, everyone got access to roto. At the same time, I think it's a really interesting take. Why do you think that pre crypto, or kind of like traditional fintech, hasn't had as easy of a time addressing these problems?
00:15:49.722 - 00:16:22.130, Speaker B: So I'd say the one word, hyper fragmentation. I guess it's two words, Africa. I'm speaking for the african context, right? Like I said, 54 countries. It's a massive region, and we try to separate it out with francophone West Africa, South, south and East Africa, MEna, Middle east and North Africa. But even in those blobs, there's still so much fragmentation and no one really is solving for it in an equitable way. It's mostly the banks who figured it out. And who are the banks there to serve? Not retail users.
00:16:22.130 - 00:17:06.214, Speaker B: They're there to serve businesses, they're there to serve retail users, to get deposits, but nothing beyond that. So, for example, I'm a big believer in fair debt. Debt is what is needed to grow businesses, grow our economies. And african debt markets are priced incredibly high because of the risk that it poses, or the perceived risk. Someone sitting in Canary Wharf, London, is setting the rates for lending to a borrower in Africa. But we're seeing a lot of fintechs cropping up who are able to price that risk themselves. But when they try to find debt from institutions, they're getting these crappy, horrible, like 20% annual rates, like ridiculous rates.
00:17:06.214 - 00:17:56.068, Speaker B: Banks in Africa are getting those rates, but we're seeing real world asset protocols doing a lot more, a better job of offering debt to these lenders in Africa. So that's one example I think is really interesting, and especially when it comes to lending. So the fintechs have figured out how to lend, they've figured out how to price the risk. Now they need to figure out where to source that debt to give it to their borrowers at a decent rate, better than the banks on the other side. The protocols are offering african debt markets which are so lucrative and so like, attractive to certain kinds of investors to everyone now. Right? So, like there's some, you know, huma finance, there's a few of these out there. Goldfinch is famous for their work in Africa, but that's, it's kind of again, leveling the playing field a little bit more.
00:17:56.116 - 00:17:58.252, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Awesome, George.
00:17:58.388 - 00:18:45.034, Speaker C: Yeah. From my perspective, it's less about crypto and more about the underlying infrastructure, blockchain technology and wallets. It's really about two things, privacy controls and decentralization. Because in the space that I come from, for decades, advertisers, brands, we're on one side, still are consumers, customers on the other side. And in the middle is this massive mess of centralization. You know, Walmart and Amazon, the big retailers hold all the consumer data. You know, Ticketmaster has, you know, controls all the data for teams and leagues and artists and concerts.
00:18:45.034 - 00:19:52.432, Speaker C: Hotels.com, Travelocity sit as an intermediary between, you know, travel companies and their customers. And for decades they just sat and controlled and still do control all of the consumer data and all of the relationships between a brand, you know, a company, a marketer and their customers. And so when I started to uncover the sort of the capabilities and the powers behind blockchain decentralization and its privacy controls, I was blown away. And I knew I just had to get in there and figure something out for the ad tech space because now big token and other companies are empowering these brands and these marketers and advertisers to go directly to their customers, create direct relationships outside of that whole centralized ecosystem and do so without having to. And this is the privacy piece. Without having to collect and store personally identifiable information or PIi.
00:19:52.432 - 00:20:24.498, Speaker C: Right now, the brand or the advertiser can eliminate massive like, liability costs and complexities around, you know, data privacy regulations and only need know what a wallet does, what a wallet likes, doesn't need to know anything about the actual person itself, create targeting and tracking abilities against somebody's wallet. And it's a huge breakthrough from my perspective. In my industry.
00:20:24.626 - 00:20:49.652, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I've spent a little bit of time toying around with some ad tech ideas myself. And it's a fascinating space. I do think the perception of a lot of people is negative ad tech. I don't want to turn into big web two again. What would you say to that? What's your pitch on there? Like, hey, there's some really interesting stuff to do in ad tech that's actually good for users.
00:20:49.748 - 00:21:22.614, Speaker C: Yeah. First of all, I like to say I'm a recovering ad tech executive, born again privacy tech consumers. People do make sort of an unwritten contractor agreement with companies that provide digital products. Right. I mean, you are getting a lot of goods and services and content for free as a human, as a person. Right. And the sort of unwritten understanding is that you're going to look at ads.
00:21:22.614 - 00:22:07.676, Speaker C: So I think people could tend to get a little carried away with how data, how hardcore people are about their data privacy. But that being said, I think ad tech has gone way too far. Like, there's a lot of stuff, a lot of data collection happening in the background. These platforms are like, listening to us. They're in our bedrooms now, identifying words that we're saying and then targeting ads. I think they've gone too far. And so there is this opportunity now to kind of course correct on that blockchain, and crypto is definitely going to help do that.
00:22:07.740 - 00:22:16.384, Speaker B: I have a follow up for you. What's the learning curve you have to go on with these traditional organizations when it comes to big token working with you?
00:22:18.324 - 00:22:52.992, Speaker C: There's been a learning curve. It's not necessarily so today. The curve is much less than it was when we first launched big token in 2018. When we first launched big token in 2018 and then 2019, I was evangelizing this thing to brands. And some people understood what I was talking about when I was saying things like, you know, California Consumer Privacy act is coming. You gotta prepare and make sure you have your ducks in a row for when you have to start complying to these data privacy regulations. GDPR is in effect now in Europe.
00:22:52.992 - 00:23:47.774, Speaker C: This is how it's affecting them. And like everything else, it takes a long time to get people to change their behavior. And so there was, like, a lot of evangelizing and some would listen, but it took us, I'd say, over a year to get people really to come to the table. Like, a good example is like, we would go into these meetings and get all the heads, like, nodding, yeah, yeah, we really need to be, you know, preparing for this. And then the follow ups would take weeks and months, and nobody would really move until CCPA hit the books. And then, oh, my God, what do we do? And so big token was there with this data union of all this privacy compliant data, we started seeing. And luckily that was like our first year out launching, so we kind of hit it pretty good, and we saw a lot of traction because of that.
00:23:47.774 - 00:24:15.350, Speaker C: Cut to today, almost everybody knows what I'm talking about when I come into these rooms and have this discussion. So the learning curve is a lot shorter, although there are still a lot of big, traditional, sort of Fortune 500 companies that are slow to move, and they're just tied to their tactics that quite honestly work.
00:24:15.462 - 00:24:16.190, Speaker A: Sure.
00:24:16.382 - 00:24:21.270, Speaker C: But I think we'll get less and less effective over time.
00:24:21.382 - 00:24:23.310, Speaker A: Absolutely. Absolutely. Right.
00:24:23.462 - 00:24:38.486, Speaker D: Yes. So, for me, thinking about fintech and crypto, it's interesting. You hear from people like, hey, in fintech and venmo, it's very easy. I use my credit card. It's easy. In crypto, it's all complicated. I kind of reject the notion that crypto is actually more complicated.
00:24:38.486 - 00:25:09.788, Speaker D: It's just that we haven't done the legwork to make it less complicated. If you look at a credit card transaction, you'd have a heart attack. If you looked at the flow diagram of what actually happens behind the scenes, you'd see all sorts of companies with acronyms you've never heard of that are involved in the transaction. When you do something on chain and you basically send something on Solana, it goes from one place, one wallet, to another place. So it's really just a matter of time before we simplify it by reject the notion that it's actually more complicated. So I think that will be an advantage at some point. The other thing is the flip side.
00:25:09.788 - 00:25:52.408, Speaker D: What do I think is going to impact the fintech space? From crypto, we hear a lot this concept of permissionless and composability. It's these hand wavy words. But to give some practical examples, I can send you a tip link with, let's say, Solana on it. You may want to convert that into USCC. You may want to swap it in traditional fintech. If I had to go build a platform to swap these two assets in my platform, that would be the next year's project. In the crypto space, there's companies like Jupyter and Orca where literally in 30 minutes, I can integrate into tiplink, and we have a mechanism now to swap, and that's done in 30 minutes, and you can move on to the next problem.
00:25:52.408 - 00:26:35.922, Speaker D: Conversely, there's kind of like this passive composability as well, where I remember when helium moved over to the Solana network. As soon as it happened, I sent over a tip link with helium token over to the founder of the Helium foundation, and he tweeted out something like, oh, all these people super hard work behind the scenes making all this stuff happen. And I was like, I did nothing. It just worked as soon as it went over to the Solana network. And so conversely, you also have the euro e people when they make a euro e stablecoin. It just works in tip link. And I remember in our first conversation with the euro e folks, I was talking to them about like, hey, tip link is a good way of kind of distributing out your euro e.
00:26:35.922 - 00:27:00.916, Speaker D: And he was like, oh, like, I want to show you this, like figma, like we already have, we're already using tip link, like, to do this thing. And so he never reached out to us, no one on our team, and just started being able to send his asset via our product. And so that composability, I think, at some point will kind of hit a velocity where in the fintech space, that iteration speed where we can all kind of build on top of each other is going to be really hard to compete with.
00:27:01.020 - 00:27:36.394, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I mean, I think anyone who spent time building in fintech, or especially if you've done it at a few companies, I think you realize I'm just rebuilding the same stuff over and over again. And there's so much infrastructure in fintech now, for sure, but it's not stacking. We're not actually gaining leverage as an industry on it. And I think a lot of it comes down to permissionlessness. You're always asking the question, it's like, okay, I can use this platform, but are they going to compete with me at some point? Am I going to compete with them? But compare that to crypto, where it's like, that's not a conversation. It's really magical.
00:27:36.394 - 00:27:52.456, Speaker A: Awesome. Let's talk specifically about Solana. I think crypto is a huge spectrum of different takes and technologies. What specifically about Solana do you all feel helps advanced fintech? Ian, why don't we start with you?
00:27:52.560 - 00:28:13.914, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So going back to the origin story of Tiplink, so we had this problem like, hey, we want to send people money with a link. That's the goal. The thing is, you can't put bank accounts on links. That concept doesn't make sense. But the thing is, wallets are just letters and numbers, so they're actually an easier thing to build on top of than the banking system. And so at the time, the only place we could build this product was really on Ethereum.
00:28:13.914 - 00:28:52.122, Speaker D: And so we were basically banging our head against the wall, because we were like, okay, I'm going to send you $10 with a link, and it's going to cost like two or $3. You're going to click a button to generate a link, and you're going to sit there and it's going to spin for like 20 something seconds. And so we were like, okay, maybe we can do like this batching thing that's kind of like an l two, but that's going to probably take us like six months to a year to build. And it's not even our product. And it was just like, you know, we kind of came to the conclusion, like, I guess we can't just build this product. And so when Solana came out and we started playing around with it, and we're like, oh, my God, this is like a 10th of a penny or close to 100th of a penny, and it goes through in 1 second. We're like, finally, we can actually build this product.
00:28:52.122 - 00:28:58.138, Speaker D: And so Solana was just like a game changer for us in enabling even the existence of our product.
00:28:58.266 - 00:28:59.986, Speaker A: Awesome, George.
00:29:00.090 - 00:29:50.224, Speaker C: Yeah, a couple of things. Number one is the way big token works is sometimes we require the ability to mint lots and lots of tokens in a really short period of time. It's like for teams, leagues, artists at a concert. We want to allow consumers to be able to scan a QR code and mint a wallet, like 10, 15, 20,000 consumers at a time in like a five minute period. Solana lets us do that. But the other really important thing in ad tech is for us, we still have to deliver on consumers opt out requests and data deletion requests. That doesn't really jive naturally with pure blockchain as it stands, the immutable ledger where things live out there forever.
00:29:50.224 - 00:30:27.304, Speaker C: So with Solana, there's actually a functionality where we can store all the really sensitive data on the either on the device side or in a central encrypted area in the wallet itself, and then just represent and govern that data on chain using Solana nfts, smart contracts. And that's a huge, that actually allowed us to fully deliver on the own and monetize your data philosophy that we have.
00:30:27.964 - 00:31:02.452, Speaker D: Actually, just to chime in on that point, we at one point wanted to have a simple button on our site where you click it and you get an NFT and you're like, okay, how hard can that be? And then you realize, well, lots of people can do this thing, and maybe like 100,000 people do this thing. And it's like incredibly expensive. Like, your company basically goes broke if you put this button on your site. And so when technologies also come out, like, Solana's pushing compressed nfts and these sort of technologies, all of a sudden it's like, okay, they mint a million of them and it costs us $50 versus we go broke. Like, all of a sudden, these new use cases kind of, like, pop up. And so your example, you know, you need to do 15, 20,000. It just.
00:31:02.452 - 00:31:03.972, Speaker D: There really is no other place to do this.
00:31:04.028 - 00:31:05.584, Speaker A: That's true. Agreed.
00:31:06.084 - 00:31:41.204, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, Solana is built for fintech, I think, and in that, retail payments. So in Africa, we're seeing a lot more retail use than institutional use. And the throughput capability, the cost as well is a big. So Africa being a super high price sensitive region, you know, the average wallet size for someone in Europe or America is a lot higher. You know, the average. The average disposable income of an African is probably like a dollar or two a week.
00:31:41.204 - 00:32:12.404, Speaker B: You know, like, it's. So when it comes to receiving remittances or whatever, like, you want to find the one that the thing that's the most cost efficient. And, yeah, the fees are huge, throughput capabilities are massive, and, yeah, the ecosystem as well. Like, there's a lot of. And working in a regulated environment, I really, it hurts me to say no to a lot of Degen builders and people who are building really cool stuff as well. And I'm just like, we can't touch you because you just, you know, you're not. We're regulated.
00:32:12.404 - 00:32:23.460, Speaker B: We're at risk of losing our licenses. So there's a lot of builders on Solana, I find, who are thinking about that from regulation and thinking about future proofing payments as well.
00:32:23.652 - 00:32:39.224, Speaker A: That's awesome. Well, there's always a trade off. So what's the hard parts about building on crypto? Where do you all see the challenges in, hopefully rebuilding fintech with crypto? George, you want to start?
00:32:42.704 - 00:33:33.704, Speaker C: I think that the crypto space and the blockchain space has historically, respectfully, had a hard time kind of getting out of their own way. There's a lot of companies and cases that are just using the tech for the tech's sake and not really figuring out, like, am I delivering something that is solving somebody's everyday problem, and am I making it really easy for that person? I think crypto, to me and blockchain is an underlying technology. Just like when consumers were adopting email, nobody really cared. You know, to your point, when you look behind the scenes at all in the credit card transaction. Nobody cares how their credit card works. They just want it. They just want to swipe it and have it work.
00:33:33.704 - 00:34:26.610, Speaker C: Nobody cares how email works. When email was adopted, they just use it. So I think web3, and I would argue that in a few years we won't even use the phrase web3. It'll just be the background architecture and underlying infrastructure of everything. But I think the challenge is to really, we gotta figure out how to make this, how to meet regular consumers, right? People, normal people, no coiners or non crypto natives, whatever we call them these days, where they are, because we're not going to change consumer behavior anytime soon. It takes a long, long time to change the way people do things. So we gotta come and meet them where they are and solve their problems today.
00:34:26.722 - 00:34:40.205, Speaker A: And I mean, I think changing consumer behavior is generally a hard problem. And especially when you involve money, gets very, very hard. I was so surprised even in like the, would talk to people who would be like, ooh, I don't want to put my credit card on my phone.
00:34:40.309 - 00:35:21.658, Speaker C: Oh, I know. You know, I actually have a, I have a little teaser of a case study to kind of bring this example home. But, you know, big token is all about doing just that, like delivering for regular people. And we're dropping a case study next week on for a staffing agency that is a global staffing agency and one of their franchises in North Dakota. In the United States, they staff beet farms. And there are a group of beet farmers in North Dakota right now that have the world's first beet harvest nfts. And they don't know that it's an NFT.
00:35:21.658 - 00:36:08.166, Speaker C: And they don't know that they have an NFT wallet on their device. Now they just know that this staffing agency sent them a $5 Walmart gift card token that they claimed. And now the staffing agency can communicate with these beet farmers. They've never been able to communicate with them on a regular basis before. They can understand them and get feedback from them, and they're now taking the beet farmers and placing them in other jobs, which for the staffing agency typically cost them anywhere from $700 to $1,000 per employee to place them somewhere. And that to them, that's their whole business model. They make like $1,500 per placement.
00:36:08.166 - 00:36:32.314, Speaker C: We're doing it now for like $7. So it's like a 500 return on investment for this staffing agency. And nobody really understands that these are nfts and wallets and blockchain pushing this around. Bead harvesters, they've cracked the power of the mullet, the utility code for web3.
00:36:32.734 - 00:36:34.710, Speaker A: Nice. Awesome, Ian.
00:36:34.902 - 00:37:17.740, Speaker D: Yeah, so I mean, it's funny, I've been starting to get more involved in DC as well. And one of the things that comes up is, admittedly as an industry, you have to be a little honest that we haven't really seen a payments product in this space that does not mention crypto. That is just a better alternative. And you have to ask the question, why is that the case and why is now different? If you think about what you need to be able to build a successful payments company, one, not that long ago, the only thing you can send around was bitcoin and it's incredibly volatile. Then USDC came around, solved that problem. Not that long ago, the blockchain costs were incredibly expensive. And now this last couple of years, they're finally cheap and fast enough to pull off these products.
00:37:17.740 - 00:38:09.350, Speaker D: Not that long ago, you need to go through a very complicated seed phrase and understanding of what a public key is and all this stuff, but these days you simply log in with Google and you can do it. And so we're getting really close to a number of these different things. The one last piece that I'm seeing to really make this more effective than traditional payments is really actually some of the stuff you're working on, which is the on ramp, off ramp piece into these different countries. Right now. If you look at some of the big companies in this space, they charge sometimes three or 4% to on ramp into crypto. And so that's fine if you're going to buy some really speculative coin, but if you're going to take $100 and then immediately turn into 100 USDC and it turns into 97 USDC, that is a non starter for basically payments use cases. So we're seeing the cost effectiveness happen on the off ramp side.
00:38:09.350 - 00:38:31.592, Speaker D: And it's a bit easier, ironically, because you don't have to worry about fraud risk because crypto settles instantaneously. But we really need those fees to collapse. And then there's going to be this moment in which the fees are cheap enough and all of a sudden we don't have to use the word crypto and we can just say we can send money around the world faster, cheaper than the nutritional space.
00:38:31.758 - 00:39:27.494, Speaker A: Yeah. There was a principle that we had at Venmo that I still love, which was like, you shouldn't have to pay money to move your own money. That is one of our guiding principles at Meso and I think we will get there, but I think there's a lot more work on the on and off Ram side that I think we're hopefully going to make some progress on. But I also think some of that is the chicken and egg problem of real businesses with real revenue, because ultimately, fiat and, like, traditional payments is actually very expensive, but consumers never see it. It's getting subsidized. So that means most, if not all, businesses online are comfortable subsidizing a cost that's way higher than what a Solana transaction is. So to me, if we can get these fees down, I think we are going to hit that inflection point where it's so cheap, it's like, why wouldn't you subsidize it? And then really, magic's going to happen.
00:39:27.584 - 00:40:11.556, Speaker B: But, yeah, yeah, the challenges you guys have really touched on. The overarching theme is like, no one gives a shit about crypto, let's be honest. Like, no, we want to move to a world where we're not talking about crypto. Right? At least I would like to. Ten years ago, 15 years ago, someone was called a digital marketer, but now they're just called a marketer, you know? So I'm trying to make my job obsolete at the company I work at. And we're getting there because my colleagues are now less emotional about the word crypto. They're more able to work with crypto companies who, compliantly, without removing the word crypto, has really helped us kind of move in that direction.
00:40:11.556 - 00:41:08.384, Speaker B: So the difficulty has been bringing a legacy payments company up to speed. That's been most difficult for me up to the point that we're comfortable with stable coins. You know, right now, one of our largest money transfer organizations that we work with globally, one of the largest ones, we're starting to substitute our pre funding, which has to happen from us dollars to USDC. And a year ago, my team would have been like, well, it's just swapping out a currency. What's the difference with that? We're now able to settle faster daily, rather than settling t plus five days, which is what it was before, and we're able to bring down the costs for their end users as well, due to the more efficient system. So the difficulty as a company that is on the on off ramp side is figuring out how to work with traditional banks and traditional businesses like ourselves as well. Right.
00:41:08.384 - 00:42:00.384, Speaker B: I get a lot of crypto companies coming to us and being like, well, why can't you do this? And I'm like, well, where to begin? Like, you know, you're not kycing your customers, we're not going to talk to you. And that's been a real struggle. The other struggle that no one really talks about in african crypto is liquidity. So there's one stable coin that's very liquid, but a lot of it is tied up in illicit finance. And there's other stable coins that are not as liquid quite yet, but they're still better than the US dollar. And as on off ramp providers, we need access to dollars as well because we're not in the utopian world of everyone being on chain yet. But yeah, those are kind of the main barriers I see right now to crypto at scale, using crypto at scale.
00:42:00.384 - 00:42:19.928, Speaker B: And when I say crypto at scale, I mean under the hood, no one cares about it. It's just happening. You know, I'm sending money to my mom. I don't need to know that. The company that I'm sending it via is using onfreek, who's using stablecoins. I just know that I'm spending 10% less than what I was spending before. My fees are lower.
00:42:19.928 - 00:42:21.088, Speaker B: That's all I need to know. Yeah.
00:42:21.216 - 00:42:55.048, Speaker A: So I think we're almost out of time. But one thing that we're now just talking about, and I've heard over and over again across crypto, is this kind of divide between, like, what does the future look like? Crypto folding the background. No one knows what's happening. Is it crypto natives? Everyone becomes a degen. Personally, I feel like most major technological shifts usually come with some new common knowledge. The classic example is the URL. The URL is kind of a technical concept, but now everyone gets it.
00:42:55.048 - 00:43:20.264, Speaker A: I tend to think there are going to be things like that in crypto, going to be like no one knows it has happened and is completely transparent. But I also don't think that people are going to be looking at etherscan and reading keys and all that stuff. So I'm curious to hear from each of you. Would your best guess be of like, what is the more technical aspects of crypto that might kind of elevate to become more common knowledge? George, do you want to start?
00:43:20.564 - 00:44:01.688, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's wallets. I think wallets will create adoption. I remember a time when every company in the world had to develop an app for your device and all of a sudden you had a million apps on your device. I think wallets will act the same way and I don't think anybody's going to know the difference between an app and a wallet. I think a wallet is going to become the new app. It may not have as many wallets as you do apps right now, hopefully. I think that is one of the things that's going to create a sort of an on flow into the space.
00:44:01.856 - 00:44:03.364, Speaker A: We're going to have to do rapid fire.
00:44:04.504 - 00:44:38.830, Speaker D: So I think the thing that people have to be careful in the crypto space is, like a lot of people say, just abstract away all the crypto and just build for normal people, and that's great. But the question is, what's the timing of when that happens? And as a crypto company, if you're a founder, if you're building this space, you don't have the luxury of eventually being right. You have to be right in a timeframe that makes sense. And so you may have to think about, what can I do in the short run that actually services some of the crypto native needs so that ultimately I can build towards the goal and the path dependence on how you get there may be the difference between you solving the end goal and getting there and dying as a company.
00:44:38.982 - 00:44:40.110, Speaker A: Great point. Great point.
00:44:40.182 - 00:45:04.638, Speaker B: I'm in an opposite position to you. I'm in a company that's been there ten years. We're hoping to be around for 100 more years and beyond. We have the time to actually try these things out and be a little bit more deliberate. And I would say that I'll end with thinking about 100% of the people who were using SMTP when it first came out knew what SMTP was. 100% of people using SMTP right now don't know what SMTP is, but we're all using it. So that's email.
00:45:04.638 - 00:45:33.386, Speaker B: That's the protocol for email. So crypto is going to go the same way. We're going to not use the word wallet. Maybe someday we'll just use it as a thing in your phone or maybe a thing that people use, a widget or whatever. So 100% of people who are using, well, almost 100% of people who are using and building in crypto right now understand crypto and blockchains. But in a couple years, we're hoping that 100% of people using it in their day to day lives don't understand it, and that's okay.
00:45:33.530 - 00:45:37.514, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you all. We're running out of time. Have a good rest of your day.
