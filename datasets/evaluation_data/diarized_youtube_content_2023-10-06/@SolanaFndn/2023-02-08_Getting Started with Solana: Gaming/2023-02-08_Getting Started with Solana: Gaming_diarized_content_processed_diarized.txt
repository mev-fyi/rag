00:00:00.400 - 00:00:23.914, Speaker A: Okay, welcome to another quick take. Video on tooling and different things that you can do on Solana. Today we'll be going over gaming and I am joined by Jonas, who has done lots of different work on games on Solana. But yeah, let's start, get started. First question that I have is like, what kind of game can you build on a blockchain or even on Solana?
00:00:24.694 - 00:01:11.104, Speaker B: Yeah, if you think about Solana like as some kind of database that everyone can use, you could basically think that you can almost build any game on it that comes out with a delay of like one or 2 seconds for your requests. So I saw already tons of games on chain, actually, like some adventures, city builder, casual games, a board game, tons of conflict games. And so basically all of these things can be built on Solana, also on chain. What is a bit tricky, maybe, is if you have some asymmetrical game like poker, where you don't want the other side of the game to know your cards, but I already saw some ways how to fix it and they're going to share a little bit of that later.
00:01:11.484 - 00:01:22.140, Speaker A: Cool. And then like, would you mention a bunch of different types of games? Would you build like a first person shooter or is that a good or a bad idea for a first person shooter?
00:01:22.172 - 00:01:40.034, Speaker B: I get ping is a little bit too high. But if you think maybe something like worms or tanks that you could build, like where you point your cannon to something and then shoot, and then you have enough time for the client to simulate the rocket, that would certainly be possible, I think.
00:01:40.334 - 00:01:48.154, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that makes perfect sense. And then like, hey, what does a developer need to start building a game on Solana?
00:01:48.614 - 00:02:19.844, Speaker B: I would say mostly to start off, you need some kind of passion. I don't know. And then you would probably start with anchor playground, for example, where you have just where you can deploy your first game within two minutes. It's an online platform where you can deploy and build your programs. And I did some examples for that. So you can just open the page, click the button, and then after two minutes, you have your first little adventure game ready, basically.
00:02:20.164 - 00:02:25.624, Speaker A: Awesome. And then like, what SDKs or other go to gaming resources are there out there today?
00:02:26.604 - 00:03:03.204, Speaker B: There is, for example, the unity SDK, which is amazing. So it lets you directly connect to the blockchain from within your unity game. You can sign transactions, you can get all your nfts, you can pass the traits of the nfts. So, yeah, that is really helpful. And then there's also like, I have a YouTube channel where I teach a few of these, of these things in videos, like how you build the game, how you port it to Unity, and then there's also a lot of open source games, which I think is a great resource. You can just look at the source code and try to figure things out yourself.
00:03:03.744 - 00:03:09.144, Speaker A: Cool. Let's see some of these open source games and see how they use Solana. Cool.
00:03:09.224 - 00:03:43.184, Speaker B: So this is the anchor playground thing I was talking about earlier. You can just open the page and then you can here start one of the tutorials. And then basically in a few seconds, you have your first on chain game deployed. Then this is a unity channel where I do some videos where you can easily get into it. Then I would like to show you this example game I was working on. So how it works is you pick an NFT and then you spawn this NFT on this map. And it's a multiplayer game, so there are currently two other players on this map.
00:03:43.184 - 00:04:09.264, Speaker B: And I have this auto approve wallet, which I can fill up with some sort to pay for transaction costs. And then I can just do auto approve transactions in the client. So here you can see how quick it is. So I can just move around like crazy. Like it's. It's almost like a shooter speed, but not quite enough for a shooter. So if I kill these enemies here, then I can collect this all.
00:04:09.564 - 00:04:13.844, Speaker A: So is each movement on here like an actual transaction on chain?
00:04:14.004 - 00:04:56.092, Speaker B: Yes, you can see here in the middle, next to the grid, you can see the status of the transaction. So now if I move to the left, you can see the first when, as long as there's the question mark, it's getting the block hash. Then as long as the little rooster rotates, it's sending it out. And as soon as the question mark is there, it means it's. The nice thing about this as well is that it's using a Websocket connection directly to the account of the board. So whenever the account changes, like when one of the players changes the account, like if you would now play as well, then I would immediately see the update as soon as the RPC gets a new state and pushes it to my client.
00:04:56.268 - 00:05:02.884, Speaker A: Okay, so you're just tracking everything via account. So that allows multiplayer gaming on this, right?
00:05:03.004 - 00:05:10.028, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's like just multiple players changing the same account and subscribing to it via websocket.
00:05:10.196 - 00:05:11.060, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:05:11.172 - 00:05:52.388, Speaker B: And there's so much things that could be built with this, though. I can't wait until other people build more games like this. Can I share a few other games? That I saw recently in the hackathon. Like there were one that I was quite excited about. There's, for example, this rock paper scissor game, which doesn't sound like much, but the nice thing, what they did is they kind of solved the hidden data problem of data on chain, like by saving a hash to the client. And then as soon as both people say it's ok now, then they share their secrets and then you know who won. And then you can also get some tokens for that year like you bet, and then afterwards you get the token whoever wins.
00:05:52.516 - 00:06:03.504, Speaker A: Cool. So that kind of thing could be used for things like. Like coin flips or loot boxes or things like, is that, is that correct? That kind of.
00:06:03.964 - 00:06:30.326, Speaker B: For a coin flip, you don't really need it because you would send a transaction and then you have some random value and you send it back. But this is more like for poker, for example, like if everyone gets the hand steel, then you of course don't want the other player to know what the hand of the other players is. They could theoretically look on chain, since everything is on chain, and then they could cheat for a coin flip. It doesn't really matter that much.
00:06:30.510 - 00:06:32.594, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Let's continue then.
00:06:33.014 - 00:07:03.490, Speaker B: All right. Then I found this other nice game. It's like where you can send your player on missions and you get XP for it and you can fight snakes and hyenas. So it's also on chain and it's completely open source, so it's a very good resource just to look at. Then there is Dominari. It's an eight x eight grid where you have multiple units that run around, and it's built with rust to wasm compiled somehow. So it's quite interesting.
00:07:03.682 - 00:07:08.614, Speaker A: So are each of these, is the whole grid stored on chain for this one?
00:07:08.914 - 00:07:19.524, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. And I think the units are NFTs. So I had a callback recently and I wanted to try it out, but it wasn't quite ready yet. But I'm going to try it soon.
00:07:20.024 - 00:07:21.084, Speaker A: All right, cool.
00:07:21.664 - 00:07:50.090, Speaker B: Then the Garvets labs, who is also working on the unity SDK, they made a location based NFT tree planting example. So that's really cool. I can plant a tree here and then it will be here and it will bounce a while and other people can also see it. And it's quite interesting how they did it. Should check it out in the Lamport dao on the twitter thread how they did it.
00:07:50.242 - 00:07:51.054, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:51.594 - 00:08:44.684, Speaker B: Then the next example I found very exciting. It's like a community driven multiplayer game where people vote on which moves to take next in a game Boy game. And what's also very interesting about it is that they have a kind of command pattern where the people vote for a while and then the data of this vote is saved in an account and the moves are saved and this enables them to later replay the whole game. So later you can scroll through the whole game and pick the place that you like the most and then mint this place as an NFT. So that was a very nice and a nice idea how you can solve this. This would also, for this real time game, probably be a good idea to have like a command pattern where you have like the different steps saved. And then also animations will be much easier to solve here because currently it's just updating the state.
00:08:45.664 - 00:09:06.998, Speaker A: So something you can do with that is like, hey, if you were playing a game of chess or something online, you could actually save specific moves even as NFTs using that same kind of pattern. So if there's a specific moveset that becomes famous, it becomes like an NFT and you can actually use it. And it's really. That would be really cool, I think. Exactly.
00:09:07.086 - 00:09:11.798, Speaker B: Queen gambit against Jakob would be an epic NFT to have.
00:09:11.966 - 00:09:12.714, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:14.534 - 00:09:42.374, Speaker B: Another nice thing I found was Kyle Sol. He's building an open source SDK for saving high scores on chain. So every game could theoretically create an account, create a season, and then save their high scores there. So that's very composable. So I really like the idea of doing that. And then the last one was just a Solana cookbook because it helped me a lot in learning how to build games on Solana.
00:09:42.754 - 00:09:50.354, Speaker A: All right, that's awesome. Yeah. So, like, and all of these are open source and you can, like, use them as examples to make other games, correct?
00:09:50.474 - 00:10:03.364, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. This one is in unity. This one is also on chain. I think they also all have, have their idls downloadable, so it will be very good.
00:10:03.524 - 00:10:14.868, Speaker A: Awesome. So, yeah, thank you for coming today and teaching us about how you can do gaming on Solana and how you can build and use Solana to interact with your games. It's been great.
00:10:15.036 - 00:10:19.588, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you so much for having me and I'm excited to share more in the future.
00:10:19.716 - 00:10:24.524, Speaker A: All right, so thank you for listening into this deep dive today on gaming. We will see you next time.
