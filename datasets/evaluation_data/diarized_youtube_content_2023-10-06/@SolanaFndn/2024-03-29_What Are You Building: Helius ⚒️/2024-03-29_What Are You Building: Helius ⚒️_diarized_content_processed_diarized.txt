00:00:04.200 - 00:00:04.958, Speaker UNK: Today I'm joined by Nick.
00:00:05.006 - 00:00:34.790, Speaker A: From Helios. So, please tell us, what are you building? Well, Helios is a developer platform on Solana, and one of our more recent projects that we're working on is a new solution for compression. We're tackling, essentially compressing tokens, as well as a solution for general accounts. Awesome. So what's your favorite use case that this unlocks? I think one of my favorite use cases is that you can now essentially distribute tokens to a very large number of people all at once without having to pay initial rent. So basically allows people to mass distribute things for cheap. Awesome.
00:00:34.790 - 00:00:48.894, Speaker A: How much does it cost to distribute 1 million these tokens? I don't do the math, but maybe around something like five to ten sol, but it really depends on the stats per person. So a million people. Wow, that sounds revolutionary. Thank you so much. You're welcome.
