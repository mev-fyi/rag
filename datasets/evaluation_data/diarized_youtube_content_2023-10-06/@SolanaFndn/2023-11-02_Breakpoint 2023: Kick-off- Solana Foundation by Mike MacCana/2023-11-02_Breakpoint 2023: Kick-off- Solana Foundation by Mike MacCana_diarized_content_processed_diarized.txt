00:00:01.760 - 00:00:38.684, Speaker A: So welcome to the developer stage. If you make things on Solana, you are here in the right place. Particularly this morning is actually somewhere I'd like to be, just as an attendee of the conference. Our first two talks are 20 minutes each. There'll be no break in between, and they're both super punchy. Our first is will from Orca, who will be talking about on chain program security. I had a sneaky look at his slides just before, and I'm super excited for that.
00:00:38.684 - 00:01:25.794, Speaker A: If you build on chain apps, there is a lot of really common pitfalls, and he goes through all of them. It's going to be 20 minutes of jam packed content for anyone who's building anything on chain. And straight after that, no breaks. At 1020, we have Steven from Solana Labs announcing the new web3 js. I use web3 js pretty much every day. There's a lot of things that I would have liked to have changed about it. I didn't even speak to Stephen when I found out about the new web3 js, and it turns out he's basically a JavaScript engineer who knows how to program JavaScript and typeScript.
00:01:25.794 - 00:02:09.078, Speaker A: It's a completely new interface. I don't want to spoil anything. Actually, I'm pumped for, super pumped for web3 js. Not just for the talk, but just for the users and for everyone who's ever felt annoyed about the old Solana web3 js. Stephen's got some amazing work. After that, we're going to have a bunch of roundtables on things like decentralized governance community, and kind of the intersection between cryptography, daos, and people after that. So after evolution of the Sol community, we're going to have decentralized decision making evolution of the Solana community as well.
00:02:09.078 - 00:02:31.274, Speaker A: We keep using Sol and Solana interchangeably. Sol is the coin, Solana is the network. A few little housekeeping announcements as well. Download the breakpoint app if you haven't. We're kind of asking people specifically about that. Just because of the strong weather conditions. Also because of the strong weather conditions, the glass garden is closed.
00:02:31.274 - 00:03:16.964, Speaker A: Yeah, just for the danger reasons. There are other places you can go if you wanted to hang out on X. The hashtag is Breakpoint 2023. You know, I am well known for causing trouble on Twitter, so feel free to like, mock me or make fun of me or whatever else while I'm on stage because I'm vulnerable and don't have access to the reply button. There is also an interactive video installation on the upper level of the innovator stage, showing off some of the best creators on Solana. There's also NFT galleries around each stage. On the main stage there's a space special gallery which is a tribute to pink skull Kitty, who was a creator that passed away earlier on this year.
00:03:16.964 - 00:04:08.616, Speaker A: What else? Anyone else here have a hangover? Is feeling maybe a little bit tired right now? No? Cool. Excellent. I'm actually basically on for the whole five days and I feel like I sleep for about two of them. I've met so many amazing people at breakpoint. I did last year when I was a member of the Solana community, and the amount of random SMBs in particular that actually turn out to be real people are remarkable. I made the terrible mistake of getting one of those AI pfps and now people on twitter just constantly pick on me for being an AipFp guy. My friend invested in the company and he made us all get AI PSPs, but now I feel I look lame and I want to buy a Kleino or an SMB and rock that.
00:04:08.616 - 00:05:00.454, Speaker A: But everybody knows that stupid fucking acqua like AI PFP face and if I change it, no one will know who I am anymore. Okay, cool. What else? Oh yeah. I have been accosted multiple times throughout breakpoint for not responding to prs on GitHub. So about 50% of the time whenever I meet somebody, I have, you know, either been, it's been a pleasant introduction, or they tell me that there's somebody who sent me a pull request two months ago and I haven't responded and just immediately started costing me about that. I've also spoken to 84 men with beards and asked them if they're mert. So far, none of them have said that they're mert, but I feel that not saying that you're mert would be something that Mert would do.
00:05:00.454 - 00:05:23.156, Speaker A: So I'm relatively sure I've met myrrt at one point, but I'm still not entirely sure on that. There's fruit, nice healthy things around. There's coffee. It doesn't suck. I know you've been to probably a lot of tech conferences. The stuff immediately to your left is actually quite decent. You just need USDC in your wallet.
00:05:23.156 - 00:06:00.190, Speaker A: As long as the Wi Fi is up, and it has been for most of the conference, the transaction should go in about 2 seconds. If you're doing any retail as well, and it goes for like, your transaction's going for more than 2 seconds, you need to like, play around with your finality options as well. If you're doing retail stuff. Honestly, Solana should never really feel like it takes longer than a bank tap. Hopefully now fight answer is on Testnet. We'll soon be in Devnet and then soon we'll be on Mainnet. Um, we won't be talking about like, you know, finalities of, uh, like, you know, two to 3 seconds.
00:06:00.190 - 00:07:19.098, Speaker A: We'll start, we'll start talking about, uh, we got smaller block times and smaller transaction confirmations as a result. Because I honestly, even if you think that, like, visa payments are too slow, you tap a card and there's this weird, awkward wait for a couple of seconds while you wait for it to be approved. Um, I think that Solana can do better than credit card payments, and I really want to see that soon. Everyone is so pumped about fydans that a year ago it was something that we was kind of not quite hypothetical, but this concept of rewriting the core Solana validator using a lot of words I remember from high frequency trading years ago, now it's deployed on Testnet, and I like that that's becoming real. Like, one of the cool things about returning to breakpoint each year is watching the evolution of the space and things people are proposing to do one year, becoming real the next year. What else? I've seen a bunch of amazing stuff elsewhere. There is gameshift, which is if you know, people who are game devs and want to do things on chain, they want to build like a really quick on chain marketplace, and they don't really want to become blockchain developers.
00:07:19.098 - 00:07:43.076, Speaker A: They just want to be game devs. Gameshift was announced a couple of days ago and allows people to do that. There's also a lot of cool third party kind of, well, not third party like community tech as well, that's been announced in the game space as well. There's one whose logo I can see, but whose name I can't remember. If you know it, shout it out. I think that's pretty much it. We will be.
00:07:43.076 - 00:07:51.164, Speaker A: I think we've got will from Orca about to come on stage. Yeah. Rock and roll. You give it up. A will from Orca.
