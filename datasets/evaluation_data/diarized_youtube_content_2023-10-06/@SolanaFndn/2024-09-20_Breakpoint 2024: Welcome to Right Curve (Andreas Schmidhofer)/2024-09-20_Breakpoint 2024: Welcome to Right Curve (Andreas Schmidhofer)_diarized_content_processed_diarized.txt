00:00:03.960 - 00:00:12.585, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to Breakpoint 2024. Good to see you.
00:00:12.625 - 00:00:41.825, Speaker B: Yes, come on in, fill the room. I see quite a few familiar faces, quite a few new faces. Who of you has been at the Breakpoint event before? Yeah, welcome back. And for whom Is this the very first Breakpoint? Yes, new faces, hello and welcome. Anybody of you who attended all three previous ones?
00:00:42.725 - 00:00:54.405, Speaker A: Yes. Few winners. Wonderful. I only missed one because I was working my corporate job back then, but I remember sitting in the office and watching all the livestream.
00:00:54.895 - 00:01:12.647, Speaker B: On that note, welcome to everybody joining us live or watching the recordings later. You might miss out on the networking and the good food that we have here in Singapore, but you will not miss out on the great speakers and presentations that we have. And boy, I tell you, we have.
00:01:12.711 - 00:01:45.445, Speaker A: Some great speakers and presentations coming up for you. Everything from the engineers of Answer over Fire Dancer all the way to Project Zero and everything in between. So you can look forward to that. We have an action packed agenda full of speakers. You find yourself here on the right curve, which is more of the developer focused stage. Out there we have an area where you can network with other devs. Back there is a Colosseum hackerspace.
00:01:45.445 - 00:02:13.495, Speaker A: In the middle we have some food. And on the very end of the hall there's the left curve stage. It's everything under one roof this time, so you can quickly change without getting wet from the rain. So that's pretty cool. Yeah, right. Okay, what else do I need to say? How are you guys doing? Do you feel ready for this? Yeah. That's the energy I want to hear.
00:02:13.495 - 00:02:46.209, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Oh, actually, you know, one of my favorite things at Breakpoint is when people come up to me and they're like, are you so landy? And I can be like, yes, yes, that's me. I'm that guy. I make those YouTube videos. So for me, this is one of my favorite things. And I'm assuming most of the speakers will really enjoy if you come up to them and ask follow up questions or chat with them. Just, you know, be very approachable.
00:02:46.209 - 00:03:17.021, Speaker A: Come take the opportunity. If we're out, come talk to us. All right, well then I guess it's time to introduce you to our first speakers. Do you still remember what this is? Yes. You might not see, but it has those nice green buttons. This is a Saga, the Solana mobile phone. Yes.
00:03:17.021 - 00:03:52.287, Speaker A: We've got a few people in the audience who also have this device. Now this is chapter one, if you will. But they did announce chapter two. I pre ordered that without really knowing what it is about. And to this day, I still don't really know what this is about, but we might find out. Let me just check if we're ready. Are you ready? Yes.
00:03:52.287 - 00:04:05.801, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. That's what we're going to do. Put your hands in front of you so you can see them. And now try this. Slap them together. Yes. Do it one more time.
00:04:05.801 - 00:04:17.489, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. And a little less. And a little less. And a little more. And a little more. And yes.
00:04:17.489 - 00:04:33.427, Speaker A: I feel like. God, this is amazing. All right, are you ready for the first speaker? The first speaker ready for us. Wonderful. Okay, let's do this one more time. Bring it up. Up, up, up, up, up, up.
00:04:33.427 - 00:04:36.515, Speaker A: And please welcome to the stage Ahmed from Sol.
