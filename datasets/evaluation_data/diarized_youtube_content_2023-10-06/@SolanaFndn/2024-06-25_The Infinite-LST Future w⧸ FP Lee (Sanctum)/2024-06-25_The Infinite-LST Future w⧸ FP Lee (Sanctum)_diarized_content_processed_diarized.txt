00:00:04.760 - 00:00:07.014, Speaker A: Fplee welcome to validated.
00:00:07.182 - 00:00:08.238, Speaker B: Happy to be on.
00:00:08.374 - 00:00:58.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm happy to have you here. Sanctum is a project we've been wanting to do an episode on for a while. I think the larger conversation of liquid staking of what are the different uses and applications of liquid staking out of just sort of your boring application, of skipping the unbonding period or being able to use it in Defi. So, yeah, you and your co founders, it's a very cool project that's ended up getting built out here. So I know there's a long story behind this, but I wanted to also sort of start off today with a little bit of scene set on the liquid staking environment on Solana, how it differs from some of the other liquid staking solutions people are familiar with, especially Lido and alluvial and all those in the Ethereum ecosystem as well.
00:01:00.030 - 00:01:34.306, Speaker B: So let me just sort of give a little bit of a history lesson, if you don't mind. Back in 2021, and this was, I think, February 2021, and I think dawn was the one who was in charge of this project of liquid staking at the time. The initial liquid staking contract was being built out by John Sinke from, from the foundation, from labs now at Anza. Yes. And I think probably he was working in conjunction with the Lido folks as well, the correspondent guys, I think, yeah.
00:01:34.338 - 00:01:44.670, Speaker A: This was one of the first things I worked on back here as well. We went through, I think, three or four different iterations of how we should build liquid staking on Solana.
00:01:44.970 - 00:02:18.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that was good. So I didn't know at the time, I didn't know anything about Solana, but I saw this sort of request for quotation, I think, asking for people to build a dashboard for the new stake pools that would soon come out. Yes. And I think most people sent in a proposal. I also sent in a proposal, and I got sort of a telegram message or email from Don one day, and he said, like, oh, wow, your proposal is like 40 pages long. And most people send me a four page proposal. So I really like to talk to you.
00:02:18.610 - 00:02:47.994, Speaker B: And one thing led to another. So we talked to him. He was very impressed, and he was like, let's build this dashboard. We thought, famously, I told my co founder at the time, I said, this is only going to take two weeks, and we're going to make $20,000. This is going to be great. Just three years later, more than three years later, we're still here. We were building this staking dashboard, and then we realized that a dashboard is quite useless because the, the contract wasn't deployed yet.
00:02:47.994 - 00:03:11.602, Speaker B: And we found like a couple of economic exploits in the contract. So we sort of raised it up with John Sinke. And one thing led to another is eventually we thought, well, if we're already doing so much work and contributing the stake pool contract, we may as well just deploy a stake pool of our own. And that became Sossian. Right. And that was like the first SPL deployed stake pool. So the chronology, I believe, was Lido came first and then marinate.
00:03:11.602 - 00:03:13.130, Speaker B: Or marinate first and then Lido.
00:03:13.210 - 00:03:16.634, Speaker A: Yeah. Lido famously did not actually use the contract.
00:03:16.722 - 00:03:18.838, Speaker B: They created their own strange. Right.
00:03:18.894 - 00:03:19.246, Speaker A: Yes.
00:03:19.318 - 00:03:35.726, Speaker B: And now they're paying the price, but, you know. Yeah. So marinate Lido. And then we were the first deploy of the sort of the official SPL staking contract, which John Cinque wrote and we helped to build. And it didn't take long, and it launched with much fanfare. Right?
00:03:35.798 - 00:03:36.094, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:36.142 - 00:04:18.682, Speaker B: But it didn't take long for me to realize that something is not quite right. Yeah, right. And so at the time, this was October 2021, and this sort of curve walls or saber walls or defi walls were in full swing. And these two competitors had launched, well, Lido obviously had already their token, but man launched token very quickly and they were fighting to fight for TVL, fight for liquidity. And it was like millions of dollars of their tokens given out, MND and LDO given as liquidity incentives to put on sabre and radium and orca pools and the like. You know, we. I am quite a perfectionist when it comes to launching the token, which is why we're still here, you know, after so long.
00:04:18.682 - 00:04:37.258, Speaker B: And I was like, this is. But I mean, in any case, I didn't really want to play this game. Right. I think, like, this is like a zero sum game. And we had very mercenary liquidity farmers whose literal full time job was to move like millions of sold, you know, from one protocol to another and farm the liquidity mining rewards. And I thought this was a very silly game to play. Yeah, right.
00:04:37.258 - 00:05:05.498, Speaker B: And I, I kept thinking, like, there must be a better way. This is not the way to go. And it turns out that there is. Right. Because the way that the stake pool contract is written on Solana is that when you do a withdrawal from a staple, there is no withdrawal queue like there is a lido, for example. There is an unbonding period. But the key is that you get the stake account right away like this.
00:05:05.498 - 00:05:05.814, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:05.862 - 00:05:06.086, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:06.118 - 00:05:19.878, Speaker B: And then, of course, it's up to you to then sort of deactivate the stake account. But the fact that you can pull out a stake account directly from any stake pool. Right. Any SPL. Stake pool as well as the lido implementation.
00:05:19.974 - 00:05:25.118, Speaker A: So I want to just like, wind back a bit because we've gotten delightfully deep very quickly.
00:05:25.214 - 00:05:25.838, Speaker B: But sorry.
00:05:25.934 - 00:06:11.270, Speaker A: No, no, just to give, like, folks who are listening, kind of an overview of, of some of the architectural differences in liquid staking on, on Solana. So Solana has native protocol delegation for staking, which is something that Ethereum does not have. On Ethereum, you need exactly 32 eth, and then you can bundle it and stake it. But there is no way on a protocol level to combine a bunch of different people's stake to have enough to actually run a validator. This is why the liquid staking ecosystem on Ethereum, at least for a very long time, has been deeply correlated around one company. Because it was a company level implementation, it was not protocol level. The way that this works on Solana is if you have tokens, you create something called a stake account.
00:06:11.270 - 00:06:38.970, Speaker A: You put those tokens into the stake account, and then you attach that stake account to a validator. The way liquid staking works is you're aggregating either multiple stake accounts or multiple token deposits into one or many validators. What you were describing is when you actually go to say, I don't want the LST anymore, I'd like to get a stake account, or I'd like to get Sol back. At least in the original implementation, you were actually getting a stake account back.
00:06:39.010 - 00:06:58.806, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly, yes. You know, I realized that sort of having been so deep in it, you've been doing for three years, I skipped so many steps. But this is very helpful. But yes, I mean, in Lido, when you withdraw, I believe you get some sort of like a ticket, and then you're in the withdrawal queue and you can wait up to 14 days and so on. Right. This is very different on Solana. And Solana, you get the stake account right away.
00:06:58.898 - 00:06:59.214, Speaker A: Yes.
00:06:59.262 - 00:07:14.814, Speaker B: Right. And that one key technical difference just makes, like, all the difference. And it's what soft sanctum is built upon. So that is like the key insight, I think. What is the significance? Right. The significance is that stake pools pretty much become fungible with one another.
00:07:14.942 - 00:07:15.230, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:15.270 - 00:07:26.696, Speaker B: So if you think about like, I mean, let's leave aside those sort of slight technical contract differences, but between, let's say if you have like, the sole blade stake pool and the Jito stake pool, they both run the same SPL program.
00:07:26.798 - 00:07:27.252, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:27.356 - 00:07:34.444, Speaker B: And, you know, they have this thing called the validator list. Right. And they have stake accounts corresponding to the validators in the validator list.
00:07:34.492 - 00:07:34.748, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:34.804 - 00:08:04.084, Speaker B: Right. And so when you want to go from B Sol to jiro sole or vice versa. Right. As long as there exists in this. In the intersection of the sets between the biso validator list and the jiro sole validator list, as long as there exists one validator, then you can perform a swap. Right. And what that means is that you perform a withdrawal from Bisol to get the B sold stake, the stake account, and you deposit that stake account into jiro Sol to get the jiro sold.
00:08:04.084 - 00:08:14.620, Speaker B: And this means that provide, you know, like, this means that, I mean, this is fungibility. That's kind of what it means. And you can do that in size with no slippage. Right. That's the key.
00:08:14.780 - 00:08:34.854, Speaker A: It sounds so simple and so obvious, but I mean, like, as you're saying, this is not like a small feature. This is like, a major technical difference between the way that liquid staking works on Solana and other places. Well, the way staking works on Solana versus other places. And it has all these upstream effects on the liquid staking environment.
00:08:34.942 - 00:08:48.886, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. It's strange how this, like, tiny little, almost like implementation detail could have sort of made such a big difference, because actually, in the marinade contract before, they didn't use to give you the stake count, they used to give you a ticket for the stake account.
00:08:48.958 - 00:08:49.238, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:49.294 - 00:08:55.398, Speaker B: And had we, you know, had the contracts all used this ticket idea, these tickets would of course, not be fungible with one another.
00:08:55.454 - 00:08:55.694, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:55.742 - 00:09:34.280, Speaker B: And then we maybe, you know, this couldn't have all been built out, but it is what it is. And therefore, we took this insight, and really what I tried to do is just carry it completely to its logical conclusion, like an absurd kind of thing. So one of the things we started immediately to build was this thing called unstake it, which is like, okay, well, so at that point, we were thinking like, okay, so let's think about liquidity. A liquid staking token requires liquidity. Right? So the whole point is that if you have. If you have a liquid token, so can be sold. The idea is that you've got to get sold right away.
00:09:34.280 - 00:09:37.272, Speaker B: That's the whole point. Otherwise, you might as well just be native staking.
00:09:37.376 - 00:09:37.736, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:37.808 - 00:09:46.696, Speaker B: And so a lot of. And this is why all of them tried aggressively to court liquidity. Right. In radium orca pools. Right. This is like a. And what this looks like.
00:09:46.696 - 00:09:54.420, Speaker B: I mean, everyone should be familiar with an amm. But if you're not, it's like a b sold sole pool, let's say, right? And half of it is be sold. Half of it is sold.
00:09:54.500 - 00:10:19.716, Speaker A: And just to sort of say the obvious part, that is deeply capital inefficient. Right. By any definition, you now have to say, okay, for, let's say I have $5 million of staked sold. That is all earning native APY from staking rewards. But all the liquidity is just passively sitting there earning nothing until it's used. But when it's used, you're still in a hole relative to just having natively staked.
00:10:19.788 - 00:10:42.460, Speaker B: I mean. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's two couple of things. One is that, of course, now there's that hurdle of that soul that's just sitting there and not doing anything. But also that if you think about an amm, usually there's demand that needs to be like, let's think about USDC, USDT, stable swap. There's demand to buy USDC, and there's demand to sell USDC. Right? But in the case of a B sold, sold, or msoul sol a jiro sold sold pool.
00:10:42.460 - 00:11:04.396, Speaker B: Right. It doesn't quite make sense for you to have the B sold site, because if you ever want to go from sold to be sold, there is a, you know, free and, you know, infinite. Like, there's no slippage, infinite size. You can go from sold to be sold. It's just staking it or depositing it into the LSD contract. So that part does not make sense. And worse yet, you have this fragmentation.
00:11:04.396 - 00:11:27.188, Speaker B: Right. Because now you've got this pool, this pool, this one, and all of them are fragmented. Right? And so I thought to myself, right, what is this, like, platonic ideal of, like, an unstaking pool? And to me, I thought about it, and to me, it looks like a pool of just a pool of naked soul just sitting there. And it services stake accounts, which means that it services all lsts, because lsts are.
00:11:27.324 - 00:11:31.084, Speaker A: Right. And I guess, hypothetically, it also services all stake accounts.
00:11:31.132 - 00:11:45.458, Speaker B: Yes. And so a lot of. Yeah, exactly. And so we built this thing called unstake it, which was unstake it. Now we've sort of retired the domain. But I. But it was a cool name, and all it does is unstake your soul instantly, right away when you connect it.
00:11:45.458 - 00:12:04.362, Speaker B: You could choose either an LST or you could choose any stake account, and we would just give you, like, quote you a fee in order to do that. And I think that sort of almost entirely obviates all the stable orca radiant pools. Because that, again, the main reason those pools are there is precisely to service this installed stake.
00:12:04.466 - 00:12:27.932, Speaker A: So you can look at this from a few different ways. One is that you are aggregating all of the existing liquidity pools that were all for individual LST pairs and pooling them into one spot. Another way to look at this is that you've donated a bunch of soul to making a non existent market. That is an ephemeral market that only comes up when a user calls for it.
00:12:28.076 - 00:12:31.020, Speaker B: An ephemeral market. What does that mean?
00:12:31.180 - 00:13:02.110, Speaker A: Each time I say, I have this, I have this stake account, not even a liquid stake token, I want to unstake it instantly. You are creating a market for something that only exists for the duration of the transaction, and then the market goes away. But they're sort of like, you can sort of call it on demand liquidity. I can just sort of throw my hand up into the ether or the soul and say, I would like a quote for how much it would cost to get this much soul instantly.
00:13:02.710 - 00:13:04.222, Speaker B: Exactly. That's exactly what we do.
00:13:04.286 - 00:13:34.070, Speaker A: Yeah. So talk to me a little bit about how you did the fee modeling there, because obviously, I think most people don't think of it this way, but staking is not really earning more money. It is actually downside protection. So the best way to think about it is if you are not staking your soul, you are basically getting deflated by whatever the inflation rate is. And if you're staking your soul, what you're actually doing is maintaining your proportional, pro rata ownership of the network.
00:13:34.230 - 00:13:51.102, Speaker B: Well, I kind of push back on that, actually. So I used to believe this was the case, but now with priority fees and with block rewards. I mean, sorry. Block rewards are inflation, so. But what about priority fees? What about MeV fees? Like, those are. You're providing a service that isn't really, like, just this inflationary part. Right.
00:13:51.166 - 00:14:00.394, Speaker A: So I guess I'd say there's been. Well, there's then two components, right? So there's sort of the protocol. Native inflation rate, the issuance rate, whatever language you want to use for that.
00:14:00.442 - 00:14:01.546, Speaker B: And that's inflationary?
00:14:01.658 - 00:14:33.914, Speaker A: Yeah. That is just like, for example, the US. Let's say there's about 5% inflation. Now, if I don't have my money in treasuries, I'm effectively losing 5% every year. Right. My checking account gives me 0%. There's a similar analogy to be made there with staking, but the same way that for example, if I were to make you a 7% USD loan and the inflation rate is 5%, I'm actually only getting 2% of real value on top of it.
00:14:33.914 - 00:14:36.910, Speaker A: That 5% is just me catching up to inflation.
00:14:37.290 - 00:14:37.770, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:37.850 - 00:14:44.674, Speaker A: So I guess that's the way I would look at priority fees and block rewards, is that. That is sort of the amount you're quote unquote getting paid.
00:14:44.762 - 00:14:46.322, Speaker B: Yes. That's the real yield.
00:14:46.426 - 00:14:56.500, Speaker A: Yeah. But that. That floor yield is actually not actually inflation. That is not actually anything you're quote unquote making. That's just your protection against deflation.
00:14:56.620 - 00:15:02.796, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, yes, I suppose that's. Yes, I think I would agree with that. Yeah.
00:15:02.988 - 00:15:17.124, Speaker A: But. Sorry, getting back to. Yeah, unstake it. Where did you guys. Yeah. How did you assess what the appropriate fee would be? When I came to you and said, hey, I have a stake account or I have an LST, I want to get out of this position today?
00:15:17.252 - 00:15:42.462, Speaker B: I think this is. Okay, so let me tell you how I do it right now. And let me tell you how I think we should do it in the future. So right now we do it based on the amount of soul that is left in the pool in the reserve. So unstake it is now called the sanctum reserve. And it is a reserve pool of soul that is just doing what we just described. And as.
00:15:42.462 - 00:15:46.848, Speaker B: So we look at one variable only, and it's called utilization rate.
00:15:46.934 - 00:15:47.172, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:47.196 - 00:15:55.860, Speaker B: And so when the pool is full, it's pretty cheap. It's like five bits or something like this. And then when it goes all the way to the top end, it becomes 500 bits. So at 5%.
00:15:55.940 - 00:15:56.300, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:56.380 - 00:16:10.340, Speaker B: And so in a situation where you get fully utilized. Right. Then that almost pays for kind of it, you know, like almost a year of soft stake. Well, not quite, but, you know, like, it's a significant chunk, but most of the time it hovers, you know, less than 10% utilization rate.
00:16:10.380 - 00:16:10.676, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:10.748 - 00:16:25.022, Speaker B: Right. So that is the stuff. So I guess, you know, whether or not this is, you know, so, I mean, this is definitely not. Not optimal, I think. Right. I think one should probably think about some sort of dynamic fee model. And I think in.
00:16:25.022 - 00:16:30.686, Speaker B: In the. I think in the ideal case, we were thinking about almost building, like, the stake account marketplace.
00:16:30.798 - 00:16:31.134, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:31.182 - 00:16:34.254, Speaker B: Right. Which is to allow people to kind of like, buy and sell these things, like.
00:16:34.302 - 00:16:34.870, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:35.030 - 00:16:37.014, Speaker B: But we are not quite there yet.
00:16:37.182 - 00:17:05.104, Speaker A: I kind of love that idea of it, too. I mean, so this is a. This is sort of apropos because we're talking sort of near the tail end of the FTX auctions and the FTX estate auctions. And so there are large positions of locked soul that have been sold. The foundation has no real role in that. Labs, no real role in that. It's between the FTX estate lawyers and the various purchasers.
00:17:05.104 - 00:17:38.510, Speaker A: But one of the interesting components of that is that you are seeing basically time locked discount pricing. So you're saying a stake account that is locked for four years of Sol is trading at some form of a discount relative to the market price. It's interesting to think about because the unbonding period is so short with stake accounts, a lot of cosmos chains, it's 21 days or longer. It's an interesting model to think about. How do you price that sort of three day willingness?
00:17:38.810 - 00:17:46.098, Speaker B: Right. Well, that again really depends on demand. Right. So when after the. So I'm not talking about the creditors, I'm talking about FTX crash.
00:17:46.154 - 00:17:46.506, Speaker A: Yes.
00:17:46.578 - 00:17:56.026, Speaker B: Right. Like that discount rate. It could be like 1020, you know, 30% haircut on your soul and you could have printed if you sort of taking an appropriately long term perspective.
00:17:56.138 - 00:18:06.032, Speaker A: So I want to get into this because I have a lot of questions about how lsts behave under adverse economic conditions. But I want to let you get to the sanctum of today from unstake it first.
00:18:06.096 - 00:18:23.264, Speaker B: Okay. We'll circle back. Yeah. So utilization rate is a proxy for it, right? Because it's kind of like demand. How much demand? And then sort of we jack up the prices. I think there is almost a case to jack up utilization rate way above 5%. Because if sold drops 30%, then you'd pay by definition, less than.
00:18:23.264 - 00:18:40.346, Speaker B: I mean, you know, depends. But, you know, you'd pay all the way up to 30% to unstake your soul. So I think we can definitely do like, a lot better there with the sort of utilization rate stuff. And of course, I think utilization rate is just. It's not perfect. It's a proxy. It's a proxy.
00:18:40.418 - 00:18:45.890, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, there's all these interesting questions. I wonder if you consider like derivative pricing.
00:18:46.050 - 00:18:52.458, Speaker B: Yeah, it's almost exactly like this. Right? Like when. Because volatility is high and then sort of. Yeah. Price. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
00:18:52.554 - 00:18:53.202, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:18:53.306 - 00:18:54.674, Speaker B: Yeah, it's cool.
00:18:54.802 - 00:19:06.468, Speaker A: So, uh, walk us through sanctum of today. You guys have expanded extensively beyond running one stake pool and having the unstake it product. What's the product suite look like today?
00:19:06.564 - 00:19:22.244, Speaker B: Yeah. So all of this is really trying to solve this. This problem of. Of, you know, liquid staking. Right. And I think empirically we've seen like, before we started, like, liquid staking percentage was like like 4%. Like the proportion of stake sold that liquid stake was less than 4%.
00:19:22.244 - 00:19:45.236, Speaker B: And then post FTX, I think it dropped like way lower, like maybe 2%. And now after sanctum, we've gone up to 6%. And that was primarily driven by us and Jiro and so on. So my goal really is that I think that most, if not all souls should be staked. And I think that most of not all souls should be liquid staked as well.
00:19:45.388 - 00:20:01.790, Speaker A: So walk me through a little bit of why you think that is. You know, if someone is long soul, they're, they're not planning to sell for the next, let's call it year or something along those lines. Why should they be in a liquid staking position relative to a native staking position?
00:20:02.490 - 00:20:26.376, Speaker B: Right. So I think it's, it really depends. Right. So number one, um, it really depends. Are you an institution or are you a sort of retail user? And I think for, we've actually built this liquid staking tokens, uh, called single validator, liquid staking tokenization. And we can come back to this. But the idea is that these charge no fees, no withdrawal, no deposit, nothing.
00:20:26.376 - 00:21:01.490, Speaker B: And so putting that into a liquid staking position is no worse than just native staking it. But there are a couple of advantages. One is, of course, now you have the ability to use indefinite. Now that's not going to be for everybody, but you always have this possibility. The other thing is that you have the choice to wait or not to wait. So you can delay, unstake for free if and when you decide to exit your position, delay on stake is always free. Or you can choose in a time of crisis to, if you want to just get your liquidity quickly, you can just pay.
00:21:01.490 - 00:21:04.438, Speaker B: It's free optionality.
00:21:04.534 - 00:21:05.310, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:21:05.430 - 00:21:27.018, Speaker B: And then the third thing is that, and this is more for retail users, that if you're a retail user, the UX for a stake account is really quite shit, despite the, like, first of all, like, wallets care most about tokens, right? Yeah, a lot of tokens and maybe some, to some extent, nfts. But 90% of their UX design is focused on tokens and how to make that flow easy.
00:21:27.074 - 00:21:27.498, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:27.594 - 00:21:33.898, Speaker B: Stake accounts are kind of, you know, relegated to the back. Like if try being a new user and, you know. Yeah, gone.
00:21:33.954 - 00:21:39.234, Speaker A: Yeah. As far as I know, backpack is the only wallet that lets you actually merge stake accounts going through the ClI.
00:21:39.282 - 00:22:10.090, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, with a stake account now, you've got to activate it, wait two days, you can pick a validator and so on. And now it's activated. You want to buy more or now you have like lots of different stake accounts that you can't merge. You want to sell half of it, you have to split it off. And then it's just gross, right? And then when you deactivate it, so many people have come up to us, it's like, oh, I've unstaked my soul, but I can't see where is it? Well, because there's this whole deactivating flow and people are used to this token idea where you buy a token and sell a token in any sort of, and then you're in and out like this. Right? Any sort of arbitrary proportion of, of your position.
00:22:10.090 - 00:22:38.556, Speaker B: And so liquid staking offers these retail guys like a huge, like, you know, increase. Like if you want to onboard people to Solana, and if you want to onboard people to staking, then it has to be like the UX has to be a lot better than what we have right now with stake accounts. And I think liquid staking tokens are almost like risk. Not completely risk free, but almost risk free and cost free abstraction layer overdose, something that is quite painful. Yeah.
00:22:38.628 - 00:22:43.884, Speaker A: Yeah. It's funny, I hadn't thought of the UX component, but that's a super valid point.
00:22:43.972 - 00:22:44.600, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:45.260 - 00:23:07.282, Speaker A: So you guys have teamed up with a few sort of well known protocols on Solana to actually help them launch liquid staking tokens. I know there's been a few sort of ideas of individuals launching liquid staking tokens as well. Walk me through sort of like, why, if I'm a protocol, I might want to launch my own LST.
00:23:07.466 - 00:23:51.216, Speaker B: Right, I'll get to that. But previously you had this question about the product suite of sanctum. So let's go back to that, and then maybe this will make more sense. Okay, back to history lesson. We launched this unstake pool, and then again, all it does is service, instant unstakes of stake accounts, which means lsts. And then we decided, well, what else does this enable? Or like, how can we improve it at this time? At the point, Jupyter did not have routing capability for the kind of LST to LST swap that we envisioned. So at the start of this podcast, I mentioned you can change Biso to Jitoso by just pulling out the stake account and putting back in.
00:23:51.288 - 00:23:51.940, Speaker A: Yes.
00:23:52.280 - 00:24:33.720, Speaker B: And so this was not a thing that was able to be done. And so we built this thing called a router, sanctum router, which does exactly what this is. So if you're going from B Sol to jira Sol, I mean, it will pull out the stake account and it will put it in, and that gives you a swap, even if there is zero native liquidity between these two lsds. So normally you need like a BSol, jiro Sol amm, or at least a BSO and a Jira solution. So there's at least like a hop in between. But here, between any two lsts, as long as they have something in common, we can sort of do the transfer. So that was the second thing that we built and integrated into Jupyter, which was very well received.
00:24:33.720 - 00:24:39.780, Speaker B: We also allow you to now stake and unstake from stake pools via Jupyter directly.
00:24:39.820 - 00:25:18.090, Speaker A: Sorry, just going back to the Jupyter example there. So behind the scenes, correct me if I'm wrong here, this is how it works. So if I have Geodosol and I want to move into be Sol, yes. I would basically go to Jupiter and I'd say, hey, I have 100 jitto soul and I want to swap it for 100 b sol. And the router would actually call to the Jito Soul stake account stake pool contract and say, I want to split off a stake account that has however much soul it should have based on the exchange rate between Jito Soul and or be sol.
00:25:18.590 - 00:25:22.650, Speaker B: Well, the exchange doesn't matter. Right. What happens if you're trying to.
00:25:23.550 - 00:25:28.142, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Yeah, but that. So it's basically on demand creating a stake account.
00:25:28.206 - 00:25:28.854, Speaker B: Yes, yes.
00:25:28.902 - 00:25:32.494, Speaker A: And then it's moving that stake account over to.
00:25:32.622 - 00:25:33.150, Speaker B: Yes.
00:25:33.270 - 00:25:34.710, Speaker A: It's reassigning it to the other.
00:25:34.750 - 00:25:43.168, Speaker B: So it's doing a delayed withdrawal from the Jiro Sol stake pool to get a stake account. It's doing then a stake account deposit into the biso. Yeah.
00:25:43.344 - 00:25:48.820, Speaker A: So it is the, the contract there is still missing out on one app, back of rewards.
00:25:49.840 - 00:25:51.352, Speaker B: Uh, the contract.
00:25:51.496 - 00:25:53.400, Speaker A: Does the stake account have to reactivate?
00:25:53.480 - 00:25:57.144, Speaker B: No, because the stake account is already activated when you pull it out.
00:25:57.192 - 00:25:58.104, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:25:58.192 - 00:26:00.312, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's activated into. Activated.
00:26:00.416 - 00:26:00.888, Speaker A: Got it.
00:26:00.944 - 00:26:08.500, Speaker B: Yeah. So you don't, you don't miss out on anything. And you can do it instantly and atomically, in fact. Right. That's what you need for a swap. So it's. Yeah, that's like pretty cool tank.
00:26:08.500 - 00:26:40.570, Speaker B: And then we have, as I said, we have instant stake and instant unstake powered by Jupyter as well. So basically we are building all this routing stuff. And finally we have this infinity, which is currently our flagship product. And what this is, is that it's the first ever LST of lsds or basket of lsts. You can think of it like this or like an index fund. I mean people have different words for it, but you can think of it as a basket of lsts. It holds bezel Jidozo Laneso.
00:26:40.570 - 00:27:16.540, Speaker B: We have like 30 lsts at this point and it allows for swaps in between them. So it's kind of like a curve pool, but turned up to eleven basically. And so this is. Yeah, again, all of these products are trying to solve the issue of liquidity, right? And so when you hold this inf token, you are getting the staking of, you're getting the basket average of the staking yields from all of these different lsts. Plus you're getting all kinds of the trading rewards of the trading fees that accrue when swaps happen between these lsts.
00:27:16.660 - 00:27:17.172, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:27:17.196 - 00:27:17.828, Speaker B: Does that make sense?
00:27:17.924 - 00:27:43.688, Speaker A: Yeah. So it is not only. So there might be an example where, for example, one LST has a slightly lower yield than another, one's super geo optimized, other is not using Jito at all, for whatever reason. So there might be a little, your average might not be the true maximum that you could potentially get, but you have all these trading fees that sort of can make up or exceed what you'd get just using the liquid that.
00:27:43.744 - 00:28:26.658, Speaker B: Exactly. So being a basket, it's obviously not going to be the best performing one by definition, but you make these sort of trading fees in between all of the swaps. And the bet is that when we increase the number of lsts, and there are compelling reasons why we would want to, we can talk about it. When we increase this number of lsts, when the number of lsts explode and trading volume gets big, then the staking yields will get a smaller percentage and then trading fees will make a larger and larger share of the pool returns, which may potentially make it the highest yielding. I don't know, no promises. But like that's the, that's the idea. Yeah.
00:28:26.754 - 00:28:39.362, Speaker A: Yeah. So, so walk me through a little bit of the use case for why people are trading between different lsts. I would sort of assume that you pick one and you're like, I like this. Yeah, I'm going to stick with this.
00:28:39.506 - 00:29:13.790, Speaker B: Right. So this is actually my favorite part to talk about because most people, and I think very much in the ethereum space, people think of lsts as just like stake pools or like different flavors of, and certainly, you know, different flavors of the same thing. Right. And no offense to staples, I used to run one myself. And I think they do a great job in decentralization, but they're all kind of different flavors of decentralization, right? Sure. Yeah. We have a little bit of a different delegation strategy, and don't get me wrong, that is needed, but to the vast majority of people this was like a ho hum kind of choice.
00:29:13.790 - 00:29:25.882, Speaker B: What we are now launch. We are launching. We are basically blowing apart the space of what an LST can be. And I'll start with like a most boring one. And then we'll get to like the more sort of like crazy out there ones.
00:29:25.946 - 00:29:26.338, Speaker A: Great.
00:29:26.434 - 00:30:17.172, Speaker B: So let's talk about single validated LSD's, right? For a long time, stake pools were sort of not that interesting to most folks because people had a personal relationship with their validator, they trust them and so on, right? And so you know that like, you know, they didn't get much uptick, right. With single validated lsts, you kind of get the best of both worlds. You get the ability to delegate your stake exactly to the validator that you want and no extra commission from the stake pool. But of course you get all the benefits of being in a liquid staking token validators like this a lot for a couple of reasons. One is that right now validated economics are just getting more and more cutthroat. You have to run 0% commission to get any delegation from a stakeholder. And validators are feeling the pinch.
00:30:17.172 - 00:30:19.132, Speaker B: I mean, now they're doing quite well because of the priority, right?
00:30:19.156 - 00:30:20.444, Speaker A: They have priority fees and those sorts.
00:30:20.452 - 00:30:42.950, Speaker B: Of things, but yes, and it's fundamentally quite commoditized, right? It's just bare metal. Bare metal, bare metal. With an LST, this allows validators to build a brand and they are able to build a sticky stake, right? Because do not underestimate the surface, the token distribution area. When you have a token of your own, that helps a lot, right?
00:30:43.290 - 00:31:20.090, Speaker A: So I totally agree. I totally get that if we're talking about a token whose price fluctuates, but like, why would an LST, like, so for example, in the example of like, oh, like, you know, I got a Jito airdrop, maybe that makes me more loyal to the Jito protocol. And maybe I'll go use the Jito liquid staking token because I have the Jitto JTO token, right? But for someone who's not like in the business of launching tokens, they're just a validator operator, like BC Soul or something like that. What is the sort of mechanic of stickiness? What do you think it comes from.
00:31:20.670 - 00:31:50.450, Speaker B: On the base of it, just having this ux improvement of being easy to like, oh, just swap into Jupyter, into lanes. So as opposed to go to the staking tab and click my validator and wait two days, that already is like a big uplift. Right. And I don't want to solve the other thing is that I think, yeah, it's like, it's an opportunity for them to build a brand because right now there aren't that many lsts. And when you launch your LST, all eyes on you now. As opposed to if you go to stakewiz.com and then there's like 2000 of them or you go to Phantom, it's this long list, it's tough.
00:31:50.450 - 00:32:35.910, Speaker B: And then with that thing you start being able to build a discord community and stuff like this. The other thing I would say is that validators are also trying very hard to innovate in this space. So a lot of them are airdropping, for example, staking block rewards, which are traditional priority shares, priority fees, mev and so on. And so we've seen validates that adopt like almost like an LST facing strategy or like an LST first strategy are able to successfully differentiate themselves from the rest of valid. And to be honest, there may be a thousand validators that are honestly kind of whole. Hum. They are not Solana native and they may be delegating 20 different chains and potatoes.
00:32:35.910 - 00:32:36.778, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:32:36.834 - 00:32:37.930, Speaker A: Potato validators.
00:32:38.090 - 00:33:00.312, Speaker B: Potato validators. And a lot of them are not running like good infra. Yeah, so that's validated lsts. Let me move on to like project lsts. And then. Yeah, so project lsts are projects like Jupiter, Helios, Drift, etcetera, choosing. They may or may not run their own validator.
00:33:00.312 - 00:33:41.210, Speaker B: Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. Right. And then the U goes to the validator or it goes directly to the, the project. So for defi projects or RPC nodes like Jupyter Helios, they care a lot about getting their transactions included into a more and more congested chain. And getting stake to their validator is like a big way to get these transactions either via stake weighted qos or via being the leader in a particular block. Because once your validator is in the leader schedule, then that is your game. The other thing is that we are seeing lsts do other things apart from being tied to validators.
00:33:41.210 - 00:34:29.424, Speaker B: These are things like Isolde, which is a cubic grant. So cubic is this public goods or public grants platform. And the idea is that you give up your staking returns to the cubic team and you give up your staking returns. But in return, that goes to fund public goods or public grants on Solana that we have never seen before anywhere else. You have Pathfinder Sol, which is parcel that goes to fund and eventually mint an NFT that cannot be rocked. You have this idea of locking the LST into the NFT and burning the NFT to get your LST back. And so the idea is that this NFT is always going to maintain its floor price of whatever the LST was put in.
00:34:29.472 - 00:34:29.792, Speaker A: Yep.
00:34:29.856 - 00:34:51.192, Speaker B: That's cool. And then finally, finally we have this idea of individual sds. You can point your staking rewards to an individual, right. And, you know, and this individual gets the rewards. Right. And I think this could be a big unlock in terms of, you know, artists, creators, influencers and so on.
00:34:51.336 - 00:35:02.782, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I like that idea. Yeah. You could even go as far as to say stuff that maybe is grant supported now, could eventually become staking supported.
00:35:02.926 - 00:35:15.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we have a couple of. I mean, you can vc fund your project, you can do a public sale, or maybe you can do this kind of like staking as a way to bootstrap something that could be interesting.
00:35:15.142 - 00:35:35.788, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of an interesting idea because if you think about the size of most seed rounds, they're not actually raising that much capital unless they're like, you know, super famous and over raising. And, you know, like, the era of the $20 million seed funds always makes me laugh a little bit. But many teams are raising 750k.
00:35:35.884 - 00:35:36.140, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:36.180 - 00:35:51.528, Speaker A: Like, that is an amount of money that you could conceivably get from staking rewards with enough people who believe in your idea. And then, you know, it's kind of an interesting way of like investing in a company at no cost to yourself.
00:35:51.704 - 00:36:16.158, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. You give up the opportunity cost, but your principle is not. And so I can imagine this whole launch pad meta whereby the company wants to almost like a Kickstarter, the company raises like 100,000 sold stake to their thing. That gives them funds to build out an MVP, eventually drop token, or maybe not do some sort of whatever with it, and then return the stakers something that they promised.
00:36:16.334 - 00:36:26.478, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting because I never would have called it this, but it's sort of like an Eigen layer funding model.
00:36:26.574 - 00:36:28.022, Speaker B: Eigen layer funding model. Right.
00:36:28.046 - 00:36:43.300, Speaker A: Where instead of Eigen layer or any restaking protocol, you're staking tokens with a validator in order to be able to run some sort of additional validated service. But instead of a validated service, you're just funding a company.
00:36:43.380 - 00:36:44.012, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
00:36:44.036 - 00:36:45.324, Speaker A: It's a very interesting idea.
00:36:45.492 - 00:36:49.756, Speaker B: I think this is very cool. I mean, because have you seen any.
00:36:49.788 - 00:36:51.532, Speaker A: Teams go this funding route yet?
00:36:51.596 - 00:37:07.270, Speaker B: Yeah. So I take two minutes to talk about path soul. Right. So the path soul is an NFT project that wants to do this unraggable NFT. And so right now there's about, I think, 20,000 sold stake to Pathfinders, which is, I think, you know, that's, that's quite a lot.
00:37:07.350 - 00:37:08.942, Speaker A: Sure. $24 million.
00:37:09.006 - 00:37:29.430, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And that is going to use to fund the art and the development and eventually the mint. Right. And, you know, that idea of like, you know, in the, you know, the NFT meta has suffered a lot because of, you know, all the rugs. Right. You. Yeah, you give your soul to this, you know, this protocol or this project after you mint the thing and then you have to pray that they don't sort of abscond with it.
00:37:29.510 - 00:37:29.918, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:30.014 - 00:37:33.474, Speaker B: I don't know if I can say it on this podcast, but, yeah, but yeah, I mean, that's fair.
00:37:33.642 - 00:37:37.898, Speaker A: Sometimes by no fault of the project alone, the price goes from 40 sold.
00:37:37.954 - 00:38:03.778, Speaker B: Two, they lose their artistic direction. They may not be actively malicious, but maybe people leave, they're not interested anymore. And how do you distribute this back to holders? And so the idea here is that even if this project crashes and burns, everybody can just sort of pull their principal back out by burning the NFT. That was minted. Super interesting to me, that is a much more attractive, like, value proposition to, you know, if you're trying to, you know.
00:38:03.834 - 00:38:04.050, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:04.090 - 00:38:04.410, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:04.490 - 00:38:10.986, Speaker A: Like you can still get, you can't get rugged beneath what the LST guarantee of the NFT is.
00:38:11.018 - 00:38:18.330, Speaker B: Exactly. Now, of course, if you buy on secondary. Sure. That's an arbitrary, but. But at least I think that is the primary thing is that the primary.
00:38:18.370 - 00:38:20.322, Speaker A: Sale is like a built in hedge.
00:38:20.506 - 00:38:44.816, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I think like that is cool. And I would like this to be like the new meta for all. And I, you know, NFT projects going forward. The other thing I will say is that I am really interested in this idea and we're really going into the clouds now. So of a sole economy. So it's like, what do I mean by this sole economy? Right now people are holding soul pretty much for speculation.
00:38:44.816 - 00:38:51.304, Speaker B: Pretty much because like they think it's going to go up. Right. And of course this doesn't mean that you're short term. You might be like super long term.
00:38:51.392 - 00:38:51.880, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:52.000 - 00:39:18.210, Speaker B: But I want people to start thinking about using their soul, not just holding it as an asset to speculate on, but as something that I can use to buy coffee, to buy art, to support this person. It's this circular soul economy where value is created and transferred and kept within the bounds of Solana.
00:39:18.330 - 00:39:29.106, Speaker A: Right. Yeah, very interesting. So I want to pivot a little bit to some of the criticisms of lsts. I want to get your take on this.
00:39:29.138 - 00:39:29.594, Speaker B: Sure.
00:39:29.722 - 00:40:17.214, Speaker A: So systems that operate well in good or normal market conditions are fairly, I wouldn't say easy to build, but they're fairly commonplace. Systems that can handle the adverse market effects are much rarer, right? I think so. One of the few things you can predict, like, not exactly clockwork, but I think we can be pretty sure in the next five years there will be some form of at least 60% market contraction from whatever the high ends up being down again. Right. Bear markets are cyclical, both in the traditional financial space and in the crypto space. So when FTX collapsed, uh, that was a centralized entity that ran functionally zero blockchain infrastructure. Um, they happened to own a bunch of sol tokens.
00:40:17.214 - 00:41:02.012, Speaker A: But we even saw on Ethereum, with the collapse of FTX. Okay, so on the collapse of FTX, um, which had nothing really to do with the Ethereum network, and there's ether on there, but we saw the price of ether start to crash the same way it did in all assets at the time. The same dynamic you're talking about the sort of idea of like, oh, Sol's dropping by 30%, ether is dropping by 30%. I want to get out of my position very quickly. But because there was not sufficient liquidity for Lido staked ether, we saw a, I believe it was seven to 10% price divergence between the price of ether and the price of the Lido stake ether.
00:41:02.076 - 00:41:02.348, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:02.404 - 00:42:01.850, Speaker A: We saw this on Solana, too, but there was just so little percentage in stake pools that the impact was much minimized. But one of the things that happened with that effect was effectively the creation of a death spiral. So the expectation that my tokens are going to be worth less by the time I'm able to restake them means I'm willing to accept a higher discount on my stake tokens, which then effectively pushes the price off of the unstaked asset lower, which then pushes the price of the staked asset lower. And you can get into these, like, really, really detrimental market cycles where the stake one drops and then the unstake one drops, which pulls this one down, which pulls this down. You can get into these race to the bottoms. This is why traditional stock markets have circuit breakers. If the Nasdaq drops by a certain percent in a certain amount of time, they just pause trading for, like, ten minutes, let everyone cool down and reassess their market positions.
00:42:01.850 - 00:42:28.710, Speaker A: Crypto does not have circumflex. So I guess the question, the big lead up to the question, how do you think people should be thinking about liquidity requirements and unstaking and sort of death spiral prevention as the percentage of liquid staking on Solana goes from two to four to six to maybe 1520, 40% someday.
00:42:28.860 - 00:42:58.538, Speaker B: Right. I mean, the first thing I'll say is that people worry a lot about sort of liquid staking token de pegs. And I think de pag is perhaps not the most accurate word, because what that really, I mean, a liquid staking derivative is basically, it sticks. All right? And so it is almost natural that in times of great sort of liquidity preference, that the stakehold should trade at the discount to the unstake asset, the.
00:42:58.554 - 00:43:01.338, Speaker A: Same way locked soul would trade at a discount to an unlocked soul.
00:43:01.394 - 00:43:42.384, Speaker B: Absolutely right. And when volatility becomes high or, like the, you know, then it almost is natural for it to. That to me, like, is a rational market preference, and it's not something that we should try to avoid at all costs. That to me, like, that seems correct. Now, that dev spiral thing is a separate kind of question, right? It's like, yes, given that the price, as in there is a divergence, but that divergence causes you to then readjust your discount rate and sort of sell into the market and so on and so forth. I think, like, that is. That is super interesting.
00:43:42.384 - 00:43:48.692, Speaker B: But do you think, does this have anything to do with state sold in particular, or is it just a sole thing?
00:43:48.796 - 00:45:03.002, Speaker A: I think it's staked assets in particular that anytime you have exit disparity between something that is. So this is the classic thing of if you have an oversupply in an economy of anything, right? You saw this all the time in Covid, right, where our fundamental ability to predict supply chains and Covid went from pretty decent to pretty terrible. And not only just shortages, but you would see things like, I think it was the summer of 2022, there was about twice as much outdoor furniture made as was bought in 2021, because no one could buy outdoor furniture, like deck chairs, stuff you'd put out in your lawn. So they massively overproduced in 2022, and not that many people bought it. And so you saw these, like, 70% fire sales on really high end outdoor furniture in, like, July. Not like in October, when you might have expected it to. And so you can see these sort of, whenever supply and demand get out of step, there are either premiums or discounts placed upon products.
00:45:03.002 - 00:45:34.554, Speaker A: And time is an interesting unit on supply and demand. That's the thing, I think is inherent to any of these types of cycles. I think you could see the exact same problem, in fact, you did see the exact same problem happen in 2008 in the financial crisis, where you would see markets that were the after hours or pre market trading would be wildly different than the previous day's close, and the market would open and just things would drop.
00:45:34.642 - 00:45:35.034, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:35.122 - 00:46:14.292, Speaker A: The difference is there you have the federal government printing money and stepping in and buying toxic debt. So there's sort of two things my mind goes to. One is that blockchains actually do need some form of central bank that maybe the Solana foundation should have a much more aggressive treasury management. Not just the Solana foundation, the Sui foundation, the Apdos foundation, whatever, should have a much more aggressive treasury deployment mechanism that much more closely limits what the Federal Reserve and central banks do in periods of crisis, which is be that buyer of last resort.
00:46:14.396 - 00:46:28.412, Speaker B: I think that is fascinating, because if you talk about this debt spiral, the Solana foundation is very happy to make this arbitrage of a couple of days, because you guys are appropriately long term holders.
00:46:28.596 - 00:46:32.680, Speaker A: I'll say I'm not a lawyer, but conceptually, we're very comfortable with that sort of thing.
00:46:33.440 - 00:46:36.216, Speaker B: Or not you can do it is a separate statement, but we would have.
00:46:36.248 - 00:46:44.232, Speaker A: No problem saying, oh, we will take on the three day risk of unstaking Sol because we weren't going to sell it anyway. We're going to give it out as a grant in two years.
00:46:44.296 - 00:47:02.554, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. And so for almost, for Solana foundation or anyone who's appropriately long term, buying this thing at a discount, like at the 30, 50% discount, it's like a no brainer. It's literally sort of free money. If you are not concerned about how the price moves in three days. Sure.
00:47:02.602 - 00:47:04.786, Speaker A: Which the foundation wouldn't be anyway.
00:47:04.858 - 00:47:05.274, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:47:05.322 - 00:47:23.514, Speaker A: Yeah. But it's funny because no one conceives of the role of a foundation as that. Like, I think if you polled everyone who works at foundations everywhere. Right. No one would say that is the sort of like, market intervention activity that it would be appropriate for a foundation to engage in.
00:47:23.562 - 00:47:23.866, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:23.938 - 00:47:30.178, Speaker A: In fact, you actually saw the ripple lawsuit, Washington sort of about exactly that to some extent on the other side, but yes.
00:47:30.354 - 00:47:35.442, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, perhaps it's a legal illegal, I think honestly, I think we.
00:47:35.466 - 00:47:40.818, Speaker A: Need something like that in the space if we are going to see lsts make up a huge percentage.
00:47:40.874 - 00:48:04.540, Speaker B: I mean, personally, I have been. Personally, I have been sort of lobbying for this. Right. I think. I mean, especially when you know that this is not like a systemic. I think there's a case to be made for maybe there's a systemic fault in the blockchain or something. And then coming in and buying might be conceived as market manipulation.
00:48:04.540 - 00:48:25.994, Speaker B: But if you have a place where, if you're in a situation where the market is kind of spiraling on its own, then I feel like it could make sense, both ethically and also pragmatically, for the foundation to come in and essentially pick a, you know, money off the floor in some sense. Right, right. But. But again, you know.
00:48:26.162 - 00:48:27.162, Speaker A: Yeah, it's.
00:48:27.186 - 00:48:30.482, Speaker B: I mean, are you able to stomach this sort of legal. I'm not sure.
00:48:30.586 - 00:48:57.104, Speaker A: I don't know. I mean, I think people forget that the us government made bank on the bailout, right. Like, they deployed $700 billion or whatever it was, and that returned, like, way more than that. Even with all the write offs from stuff that truly went to zero. Right. The government made money for the taxpayer and helped to actually shore up the budget a little bit in those sort of extreme market operations it did back in 2008.
00:48:57.112 - 00:49:05.680, Speaker B: And zero nine, if you think about the unstaked pool, it basically, or the sanctum reserve pool, it basically is the buyer of last resort in some sense.
00:49:05.760 - 00:49:09.888, Speaker A: Right. It's just not big enough to handle the market of that size yet.
00:49:09.984 - 00:49:12.584, Speaker B: Well, yeah, it has to grow in lockstep with.
00:49:12.632 - 00:49:13.224, Speaker A: Of course.
00:49:13.352 - 00:49:24.088, Speaker B: And then the other thing is that, of course, there is no free lunch. The foundation has a unique position because it may not need to stake itself.
00:49:24.224 - 00:49:27.656, Speaker A: It's also a nonprofit. We are anti profit motivated.
00:49:27.728 - 00:50:02.980, Speaker B: Okay, perfect. But, of course, if I am opening right now, the reserve pool is not open to public depositors. But I think if there was a nonprofit organization like the foundation, then there would be a very strong case for the foundation to be able to use the reserve as a buyer of last resort to do exactly this thing. But if you open it up to the open market now, you have to be thinking like, okay, is this pool going to actually perform better than just staking your soul? Especially because its job is to catch the falling knife.
00:50:03.280 - 00:50:15.724, Speaker A: Right. It's kind of interesting, though, because, like, in a hypothetical world where there's an extreme market event, again, and let's say I'm very long on soul, and I happen to have a bunch of unstaked soul at the time.
00:50:15.772 - 00:50:18.924, Speaker B: But that's the thing. Why would you ever have unstaked soul at the time? Yeah, right. Like that.
00:50:18.972 - 00:50:19.636, Speaker A: This is the challenge.
00:50:19.668 - 00:50:37.884, Speaker B: If we believe that most like, as in it's kind of like, right. You can't have it both ways. If you're a long term investor, you're almost definitely going to stake your soul, because why wouldn't you? And so you need somehow this pool, like, unstaked soul that is ready to come, and you have to be appropriately long term. So you don't mind to take this, but then your soul will be staked. So it's like, it is kind of.
00:50:37.892 - 00:51:02.460, Speaker A: Like you see the catch 22, right? Because even on the same. By the same logic, it's sort of like if the foundation had a pool of soul sitting around to do those type of extreme market work, the question would be, well, why aren't you delegating it out to help support new validators and all these other types of things? It's interesting.
00:51:02.620 - 00:51:30.512, Speaker B: I think the answer has to be, we care about the systemic, we care that the system runs, we care that lsts grow, and we care about the health of this whole defi economy, because the lsts are the backbone, are the bedrock of defi. The foundation has to think, okay, this probably makes there is a case for having a pool of unstake soul, not doing anything, not being delegated, so that it can make sure that this entire ecosystem is healthy.
00:51:30.656 - 00:51:39.330, Speaker A: Fascinating. Well, before we wrap up today, what's next for sanctum? What's coming soon? Where can people learn more about the project?
00:51:40.270 - 00:52:02.966, Speaker B: Yeah, so we are currently running a points program. I don't like to call it points. It's a user experience program. It's Wonderland. It's wonderful. So we try to do something very different, and users love it. There was a lot of fatigue in existing programs, and we really want to do something fun and interesting and get the community together.
00:52:02.966 - 00:52:21.246, Speaker B: Yeah, that's something. I really hope everyone checks out. The other thing is that we are launching a token. I don't know if I can say it. We are launching a token. So I have on my twitter x.com soleconomist written a draft proposal of what sanctum's tokenomics will look like.
00:52:21.246 - 00:53:06.090, Speaker B: And I want to use this opportunity to get everyone here who is interested and long term deligned to give me comments on what our token looked like. And I want to set this whole new meta of, instead of tokenomics being something that's dictated from top down to be something that we really try and build with the community together, because I think that sanctum, uniquely, compared to a lot of protocols, it really needs the community support in order to grow. We want to. This whole LST revolution is not possible without all our partners and without everybody who, you know, believes in lsts. And so that's what I really want, you know, people to come and reach out and give us your comments and tell us how we can improve. Awesome. Love it.
00:53:06.170 - 00:53:08.738, Speaker A: Well, FP, thank you for joining us on validated.
00:53:08.834 - 00:53:09.490, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
