00:00:00.440 - 00:00:33.528, Speaker A: Implementing transfer fees for tokens on Solana was really difficult, but not anymore. So now we have the transfer fee token extension, which makes it extremely easy. So all you need to do is when you create the mint of your token, you add the parameter transfer free, followed by the percentage point that you want per token transfer, and then followed by the maximum fee that can be collected. And then whenever you transfer the token, you need to add the expected fee. This is mostly to not have any surprises when something is transferred, and then in the end they can withdraw the withheld tokens. And this looks like this on chain. So here I just collect the fees again.
00:00:33.528 - 00:00:38.424, Speaker A: So yeah, try it out and build yourself some tokens with transfer fees. It has never been easier than now.
