00:00:00.480 - 00:00:37.282, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, welcome to part two of our big ideas day here. I hope you're ready for a lot of incredible panels. If you're here for Andrea, part of the Andrea fan club, don't worry, he'll be back tomorrow with another pair of stylish pants. You'll get more, Andrea, but you've got me now for the rest of the day. Without further ado, I want to bring up Nalin Mithel from Google. He's the head of product for Google Cloud's web3 efforts. So we'll hear from Nalin and then we'll hear from Nolan and Anatoly shortly after.
00:00:37.282 - 00:00:38.734, Speaker A: Nolan, come on up.
00:00:52.154 - 00:01:28.400, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. I'm so excited to be here. My name is Nolan and I'm the web3 lead for Google Cloud. And so you're probably already thinking Google Web three. What's that all about? So I wanted to do a quick review of what we've been up to and then get into what we're doing specifically for Solana. So in 2018, we started indexing bitcoin blockchain data and making it available in bigquery so you can query it through SQL. In 2019, we added support for six more protocols and now we have support for about twelve protocols.
00:01:28.400 - 00:02:06.334, Speaker B: So these are all datasets available to you. Now you can query it with SQL. And these are among our most popular data sets in Bigquery. In 2020, we started operating our first validator for Hedera hashgraph, and now we operate validators for a lot of the top l one protocols. In 2021, YouTube started issuing nfts to its creators as part of its yearly awards program for the most and best popular youtubers. And then in 2022 is when we've really deepened our investment in this space. So we formed a formal web3 team in Google Cloud.
00:02:06.334 - 00:02:46.934, Speaker B: This is like a natural evolution for us because we saw a lot of our financial services, crypto native gaming customers do more and more blockchain related workloads on GCP, and it was clear that a dedicated product suite for web3 would serve them better. Then we launched a Google for Startups cloud program. And this is different than our traditional web two program, so the criteria is different. We recognize that web3 startups don't look like web two startups, and now we're able to give you credits in a different way. At next, we had a really exciting announcement. We partnered with Coinbase and now you can pay for Google Cloud with crypto. So we're really excited about that.
00:02:46.934 - 00:03:22.692, Speaker B: Don't have to worry about converting to fiat, or all the headaches involved in that. And then just last week, we announced our first product in web3, called blockchain Node engine. So this is a fully managed, dedicated RPC node service. So you can quickly launch a node, we manage it, we monitor it, we restart it safely, we upgrade it. You don't have to worry about managing it at all. And you can deploy it in variety of regions, and you get all the security and performance that you expect from a Google product. So I wanted to switch gears a little bit and talk a little bit about what we're doing to support the Solana ecosystem.
00:03:22.692 - 00:04:10.070, Speaker B: We recognize how active and passionate this community is, and we want to make it a top priority for Google cloud. So there's a few things we're doing that I wanted to share. So the first thing is we've been running a Solana validator, and that helps us understand the nuances and challenges of running a validator in the cloud. And we spent a lot of time, both with the foundation and our partners, like block Daemon, to figure out how do we do this in an optimal way that can be cost effective in the cloud. So the second thing is, I talked about how we launched blockchain node engine last week. So we're taking the learnings from running a validator, and we're working with the foundation to figure out how we can bring Solana support to blockchain node engine. So again, this is fully managed service.
00:04:10.070 - 00:04:50.522, Speaker B: We want to make it one click, run a Solana node in a cost effective way. The third thing is Solana data and bigquery. So we've heard loud and clear how important it is to get data, historical data for Solana and make it accessible to Solana developers. We've already been working with Solana, with bigtable, so all the historical data lives in bigtable, but now we're indexing it in bigquery so you can have easier access to it and query it through SQL. You don't have to worry about making a copy of the bigtable instance and all of that. So that'll be available in Q one of next year. And then I talked about this a little bit, but I wanted to reiterate, you can pay us with crypto.
00:04:50.522 - 00:05:18.278, Speaker B: So if you're already holding a lot of crypto and you don't want to convert it to fiat, now you can actually just pay us with that crypto. And then finally we have a credits program. You can go here. So we want to bring our credits program to select startups in the Solana ecosystem. And support that innovation. So if you're a smaller team and you're looking for help, you can apply for up to $100,000 in cloud credits. So go to that URL or you can come talk to me.
00:05:18.278 - 00:05:29.484, Speaker B: We can help you out with that. And that's pretty much it. Thanks for having me. I hope you're as excited as we are about how we're supporting the ecosystem. And I look forward to talking doing with a lot of you. Thanks a lot.
00:05:35.344 - 00:05:52.252, Speaker A: Thanks so much. Thanks so much, Nolan. We're so excited to have Google building on Solana and building with the whole community here to talk about this a little bit more. Anatoly, please come on up and we'll hear about Google's vision for web3 building in the salon ecosystem.
00:05:52.348 - 00:05:53.464, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you.
00:06:03.884 - 00:06:04.484, Speaker A: I'll go get.
00:06:04.524 - 00:06:05.224, Speaker C: Totally.
00:06:07.204 - 00:06:08.304, Speaker B: Good to see you.
00:06:10.324 - 00:06:14.864, Speaker C: Whoa. Wow. Packed house.
00:06:16.284 - 00:06:17.178, Speaker B: Pretty amazing.
00:06:17.276 - 00:06:23.166, Speaker C: Yep. Awesome to be here.
00:06:23.310 - 00:06:34.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm really excited. This is my first break point. Super exciting to be here and inspired by all the energy. Yeah, we're really looking forward to supporting Solana as we move forward.
00:06:35.214 - 00:06:53.324, Speaker C: Yeah, excited as well. There's a lot of stuff that Google and Solana can collaborate on. I think if any of you are validators, you know how much data Solana, Solana generates. And one of the best places to process and query that data is obviously Google and their massive and amazing intro.
00:06:54.144 - 00:07:12.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we've seen since we launched bigquery data sets, those have become so popular. People love being able to access blockchain data through SQL instead of RPC APIs. So that's been a big win. And I think we can bring Solana data to bigquery. It's going to be great.
00:07:13.214 - 00:07:16.634, Speaker C: Is the SQL service called Sqlana?
00:07:18.454 - 00:07:32.790, Speaker B: I guess it's an option, yeah, we can call the Solana dataset Sqlana. Yeah. So that'll be great. And then I think on the node infrastructure side, I think it's gonna be really important that we work together to optimize those as well.
00:07:32.982 - 00:07:53.216, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a lot of, I think, real challenges there with cloud and for providers because of how much compute the Solana servers use. And it's very specific. We need faster clock cores, more so than even more cores on a system. And that's pretty atypical for most cloud providers.
00:07:53.360 - 00:08:26.144, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. So those are the two categories we're looking at are how can we provide hardware configurations that are higher clock speed, higher ram, lower core to save costs. So really like reducing the core to memory ratio. So that's one. And then the second thing is obviously egress. If you've run, you know, that that's like the biggest cost or one of the biggest costs. So how can we provide more standard pricing so it's predictable and cost effective and you don't have to pay for every piece of data coming in and out.
00:08:26.264 - 00:08:41.813, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. And I think within, especially within any single zone or probably within all of Google infrastructure, there's a bunch of optimizations we can do between nodes that are all running there to reduce a lot of the egress and only really focus on the stuff that's going out.
00:08:42.113 - 00:08:56.773, Speaker B: Yeah. If we can optimize nodes and maybe the client software for GCP and the specific infrastructure that we provide, I think we can probably provide a better service for the ecosystem.
00:08:57.153 - 00:08:59.493, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, really looking forward to that.
00:09:01.404 - 00:09:25.996, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, I mean, some of the other things that I think it's really important is like we work together on just providing more easier ways to build. On Solana, we talk a lot about how do we bring a billion users to web3 and blockchain, and I think it's really about how do we make it easier to build the apps which are eventually going to bring those users.
00:09:26.100 - 00:10:08.224, Speaker C: Absolutely. I think a layer one itself is not something that my mom is ever going to use. She knows what I'm building, but it's not a product that is ever serving her needs directly. But it's the applications built on top and those folks that are figuring out the real value that's created for users, for creators. That is so good that it's worth figuring out what cryptography is, figuring out how to secure those seed phrases and actually start using these applications. And it's still super early days, like right now. I would say in aggregate, between all the blockchains combined, there's maybe 3 million monthly active users that are actively signing transactions.
00:10:08.224 - 00:10:13.904, Speaker C: And that's like 1996 Internet days, right? About when Google started.
00:10:14.924 - 00:10:52.084, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's true. It's interesting because I think while both of us are trying to solve the developer experience problem, which is core, because we're going to help iterate and build better applications on top of these things, I think what you're doing with the saga phone is also really interesting because it's the end user angle and how do we make the wallet transaction experience seamless. I think both of those things innovating both on the user experience side of things and the developer experience side of things gets us to a place where this can actually be a mainstream application.
00:10:52.624 - 00:11:25.544, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah. Android has been open source from day one, basically. And it's awesome to be able to actually take that source code and modify it to suit our needs and to build this first class experience where signing a transaction is as awesome as using Google Pay or Apple Pay or whatever. And that's been, I think, a dream for me since I started Solana. Having worked at Qualcomm for over a decade, it just felt natural that your phone should be your hardware wallet as well.
00:11:26.364 - 00:12:11.444, Speaker B: Yeah, makes a lot of sense. I love the vision there, and we're excited that you're building on Android for sure. So I can't wait to see how that developer ecosystem takes off. The investments you're making on the mobile SDK side and the real, like, the developer experience, I think that's everything, really. Like, if you think about iPhone, when it first came out, it was great, amazing device game changing, but it was for more or less a computer with a touchscreen. It wasn't until the SDKs and the app ecosystem came out that it was something we couldn't live without. And I can see if you make the right investments in the developer experience now that inflection point can happen for web3.
00:12:12.124 - 00:12:31.548, Speaker C: Absolutely. And I don't know if folks remember the early days of iPhone apps. There was a couple cycles before we went from that to the really life changing applications that were like Uber, where you felt like you had a magical device in your hand that solved a real life problem. And I think the similar cycle will happen in web3 as well.
00:12:31.716 - 00:13:00.892, Speaker B: Yeah, it's exciting to think about what those experiences might be, and it's completely unpredictable. Right. When Apple put out that entire developer ecosystem, I don't think they could have predicted the kinds of experiences that would be created. And I think that's the really exciting part about where we are. We have no idea what's going to be built. I'm sure some of you in this room do as you're actively building those things, but the world as a whole has no idea what's coming and just can't wait to see what comes out.
00:13:01.028 - 00:13:24.606, Speaker C: Absolutely. So I hope folks check out the SQL database, the SQL query language for Solana. That is actually a really, really cool thing. I don't know if you've ever tried building indexing services on top of the Solana database. It's a massive undertaking to query those things and to build rich data. So this is pretty big lift from Google, and I'm super, super lucky to be working with you guys.
00:13:24.790 - 00:13:43.514, Speaker B: Thanks. Yeah, likewise. We're excited to work with you. Guys, I think for us, democratizing access to blockchain data is super important. That's how we're going to foster a lot of innovation in this space. So giving access to. We're starting with historical analysis through SQL.
00:13:43.514 - 00:14:22.394, Speaker B: We also want to help with real time event processing in the future. But for now, I think that's where the opportunity is. And it's not just being able to process Solana data and historical data, but because it's SQL. And if you store your own data in Bigquery, you can join now like your own internal data sets with the data on the blockchain and really figure out the right blend there. Because I think that finding that balance of what you should store on chain versus what you should store off chain is really important. And then bringing those things together is not trivial. And I think if we build the right tools, we can help developers find that balance a lot easier.
00:14:22.974 - 00:14:50.304, Speaker C: Definitely there's still a big engineering challenge left of tracking the account state as it's being updated. So I don't know if folks have seen Richard's post on Twitter and stuff. That would be an amazing next step. How do you track the state transitions and the checkpoints between accounts for every block and being able to go back in time and recall the state of the chain. So if I had any free time, I would be working on that.
00:14:51.724 - 00:15:18.024, Speaker B: Hopefully some of you guys can help us with that as well. Yeah, so I think when we think about how we can support Solana, we talked about nodes and data. I'd love to hear from you. Where else do you think the opportunity is for Google to help in web3? Where can we apply the scale, the hard engineering problems we're solving to really move the ecosystem forward.
00:15:18.964 - 00:16:10.132, Speaker C: So I think on building better SDKs for quickly developing applications is definitely one of those, because a lot of developers have to build a lot of infra just to launch a single app. You still need back end services, you still need the connectors to the chain itself and that state. And making that like a one click experience I think would be awesome. The other side of it, I think, is more on the user side. I think storing seed phrases is still a very complicated thing. And this is, I think, an unsolved problem. But there's a bunch of research that's been done on effectively storing secrets in a way that Google doesn't even know the CT Res and you have partial recovery of the keys between the user and a service provider like Google that can verify your identity and making that an amazing experience.
00:16:10.132 - 00:16:13.824, Speaker C: That's scalable across all of Google. Auth would be awesome.
00:16:14.524 - 00:16:52.628, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're definitely looking into that. We announced multi party computers, confidential compute, and I think those products and that innovation can really help here. I agree. One of the biggest challenges right now is exactly that. So you're forced to either have, you know, self custody wallet where the user has to manage that, or a custodial wallet where the user doesn't have any of it. And now you have to trust a third party. But really the answer is something in the middle where the user has control, the developer has control, and maybe like a third party, like Google has also a piece to play there.
00:16:52.628 - 00:17:00.348, Speaker B: So there's multiple parties involved and that de risks and makes the adoption easier here.
00:17:00.436 - 00:17:01.384, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:17:05.284 - 00:17:33.542, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I think it'd be interesting also to learn, like how you see, we've talked about Saga and super excited about the announcements there. I'd love to hear how you think the innovations that you're doing there can influence the larger Android ecosystem and the Google Play roadmap. Where do you see Google Play going, if you could wave a wand?
00:17:33.678 - 00:18:47.384, Speaker C: I think the shift that we're seeing now is from this idea that content is rented. Like when you buy a movie in Amazon prime, even though you buy to own, you don't actually own it, you're renting it from Amazon forever as long as Amazon allows you to rent it. But with digital items, you actually own them. They're stored on a database that nobody owns and that ownership is tracked by Solana or whatever and nobody can actually modify it. Not Google, not the creator. And that shift is going to, I think, transform the content industry, like YouTube and Google Play and all these other services that Google runs, because when the content creator no longer owns that content, the kind of monetization schemes that work on, like charging 20% on every value of digital items will have to change. So I think if I could wave a magic wand, obviously I would, you know, have a way for creators and like marketplaces and all the folks that are actually trading and like in the digital content business, being able to share profits with a play store as opposed to a huge fee on the transactional volume.
00:18:47.384 - 00:18:52.984, Speaker C: I think that's going to happen eventually. It's just going to be a very, like, it'll take time.
00:18:53.804 - 00:19:06.366, Speaker B: Yeah. And hopefully, like, you know, as you guys go to market and work with all the developers in this room and some of those models get proved out, then it'll be easier for other companies to adopt them.
00:19:06.470 - 00:19:07.434, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:19:08.934 - 00:19:31.464, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I think it's also I'd love to understand how you think about, you talked about the user experience side of things where we can help. Are there other things outside of key management on the user experience side that maybe Google can help with, or do you have any thoughts there?
00:19:32.044 - 00:20:20.184, Speaker C: Well, a lot of the libraries that Google has built already for the web, I think are very much applicable to web3 development. A lot of folks have to build mobile optimized applications. I think everybody here probably builds and develops on Chrome. That's the number one problem. So a lot of like adding SDKs to make it easy for people that are building these apps to just connect to wallets and have standardization around wallet adapters and just all that stuff. If Google took the lead on that, I think that would really make like, just optimize the amount of time developers have to spend on any of this stuff. Having those libraries, I think, is one of the critical pieces right now and makes the whole ecosystem around crypto very fragmented.
00:20:20.724 - 00:20:37.180, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I think we do have a long history in open source software and helping evolve and contributing to things like whether it's web3 js or ethers, JS would probably. There's probably a lot of room for improvement there.
00:20:37.292 - 00:20:41.744, Speaker C: Absolutely. Yeah, web3 js definitely needs some improvement.
00:20:43.024 - 00:21:19.340, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we've all built with those libraries and I think it's off to a great start in terms of like just a year or two ago, you couldn't do a lot of these things. And so I think it's definitely hard problems because a lot of it is about connecting to that wallet that sits in a chrome extension or something like that. And that never works. Folks like Wallet Connect are making that really easy, which is great. You guys are making it easier with your new SDKs on saga. And those correct me or help me understand those work not only natively but also on mobile web.
00:21:19.492 - 00:21:43.094, Speaker C: Yep. Yeah. So the really cool demo is using chrome as a native application and seeing the wallet connect button. It automatically connects you through a websocket to your phantom app. And that works on normal Android without even the saga SMS SDK, just simply through the native APIs. And that's a much, just slicker experience.
00:21:43.434 - 00:22:29.978, Speaker B: Yeah, that was one of the things that stood out to me was that it's really interesting because when you saw the demo of saga and you saw that wallet connect experience to the average user, if you're not building or if you don't have a lot of experience, it doesn't seem very significant. It's like, okay, connected to a wallet. But if you know the alternative and how complex and frustrating and hard to learn that whole experience is, that's when you really appreciate it. And so I think that's the thing, is that a lot of people aren't even willing to try right now or learn because it's so hard. And if we can get it to the point where it's like, okay, I don't understand what the big deal is. This is just like the regular web, then that's when we actually take off.
00:22:30.066 - 00:23:07.450, Speaker C: Exactly. And that's a huge win when people stop noticing. But I think, you know, I think we're still like, this is the best analogy. I always bring up to folks that ask me, why don't we just like hide the wallet? You know, in the nineties, people build all sorts of views to the web that were the AOL keywords. They tried to hide the URL bars because people didn't understand them. And it took a mental shift for people to actually get the web that links mean something, that you're going from one server to the next, and it was one giant composable document. And the same thing is going to happen with wallets.
00:23:07.450 - 00:23:43.114, Speaker C: People need to understand that there is a seed phrase, even if it has amazing, slick recovery through a Google service, that signing that transaction actually means transferring ownership. And once that mental shift happens, you'll see, I think, the same kind of adoption curve that you saw with the web. And I'm really excited to see what kind of applications people build when there are 100 million people that understand how to use crypto, because we just can't even predict what that's going to be. That's like trying to predict Facebook when you're looking at a bulletin board in 1996.
00:23:43.854 - 00:24:38.444, Speaker B: Yeah, makes sense when we look back ten years from now and think about what did blockchain do for us, how did it change the way we live and work. I think those experiences are still kind of foreign, like we haven't seen them yet. I think nfts, I think decentralized finance, I think the gaming experiences we're starting to see will just be a small subset of it. I'm really excited about where decentralized identity might be able to take us and the way you'll be able to interact with products and services in that way. And maybe the things that you're building with the streamlined user interface can actually accelerate some of that. I think California and New York recently said things like marriage certificates, birth certificates can be on the blockchain, and maybe those will be forcing functions for some of this. I don't know for sure.
00:24:40.984 - 00:24:43.924, Speaker C: Who'S going to have the first Solana baby on the blockchain.
00:24:45.904 - 00:24:59.804, Speaker B: We were joking the other day. One of our teammates just had a newborn and we were asking him if they chose the name based on name availability. Like ENS availability, but it could be sole availability.
00:25:02.504 - 00:25:04.720, Speaker C: Better reserve your SNS names.
00:25:04.872 - 00:25:13.732, Speaker B: Yeah. Gmail and Twitter anymore, I guess. Awesome. Well, this was really great. I enjoyed talking with you.
00:25:13.828 - 00:25:14.580, Speaker C: Likewise.
00:25:14.732 - 00:25:33.836, Speaker B: Super excited to talk with everyone here. Let me know how we can help. I know you might be thinking like, oh, what's Google doing in this space? But we really want to help here. I think in the short term we can help with. We talk about all of this infrastructure being decentralized. In reality, it's not that decentralized. So I think we can help in the short term there.
00:25:33.836 - 00:25:47.584, Speaker B: And I think in the longer term, I'd love to figure out how we can help with multicloud infrastructure. Right? Like, you come to Google and you can deploy multinode clusters all across different providers. So we definitely want to help here.
00:25:47.744 - 00:25:49.264, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you so much. Yeah.
