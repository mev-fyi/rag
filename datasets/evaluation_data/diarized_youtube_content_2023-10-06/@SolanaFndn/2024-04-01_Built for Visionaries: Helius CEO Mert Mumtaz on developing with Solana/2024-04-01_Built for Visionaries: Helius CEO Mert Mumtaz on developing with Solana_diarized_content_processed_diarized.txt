00:00:00.240 - 00:00:28.574, Speaker A: I'm the co founder and CEO of Helios, a developer platform for Solana developers. It helps you build better, faster and cheaper applications on the Solana blockchain. The entirety of the success of Helios is due to the Solana community itself. Solana is the fastest, most performant, most scalable, and the most cost efficient chain out there, and will be for a very, very long time. This chain has amazing tech, but more importantly, it has an amazing community that supports you. There's just no other alternative that I could even imagine building on top of other than Solana.
