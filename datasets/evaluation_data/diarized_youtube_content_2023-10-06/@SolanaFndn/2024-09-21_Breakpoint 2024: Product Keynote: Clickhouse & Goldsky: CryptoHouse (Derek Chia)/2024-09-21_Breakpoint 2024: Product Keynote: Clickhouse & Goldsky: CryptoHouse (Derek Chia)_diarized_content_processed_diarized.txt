00:00:04.840 - 00:00:35.515, Speaker A: Hi everyone, how are you doing? Good, right? Thank you. So I'm from Clickhouse and today I'm going to introduce to you Crypto House. So Crypto House is a free blockchain analytics service powered by Clickhouse and Goldsky. So before I talk about Crypto House, let me show, let me tell you more about Clickhouse. Clickhouse is an open source analytical database developed since 2009. We have over 36,000 GitHub stores with over 500 releases. It is column oriented and we do very best, very well in aggregations.
00:00:35.515 - 00:01:20.365, Speaker A: People said you can use this in a single binary or you can set up in a distributed fashion. We support applications with shards and you can do this across regions. If you have any analytical use case, then Clickhouse is the best database for you. If you need something managed, then please visit Clickhouse Cloud for a service. So why is Clickhouse ideal for blockchain analytics? First it speaks SQL which means that most SQL compatible URL applications dashboards would work out of the box including services like Dune. We support a lot of writes and this means that you can have several millions writes per second coming into one single server per server. And for reference the transaction row rates for solana, it's around 4,000 per second.
00:01:20.365 - 00:01:54.135, Speaker A: It is distributed. Many people set up Clickhouse in production in a distributed fashion with applications for high availability and with shots. The largest known cluster is over 4,000 servers and I'm sure there are larger cluster that is unknown to us. It is also highly efficient. What this means is that we offer encodings and compression options. For example an uncompressed CSV you get to enjoy over 20 times the compression rate. This means that you save money in terms of storage.
00:01:54.135 - 00:02:49.793, Speaker A: The next one is most important because Clickhouse runs blazing fast queries, we scan and process billions of rows per second and you will need this in order to get real time analytics coming out from blockchain data. Last but not least, most of the transactions and blocks data are structured and is suited for OLED modeling. What this means is that you can have joins, you can use joins for in depth analysis and we do support that as well. So Clickhouse is very honored to be trusted by multiple companies in the blockchain analytics space today I quote Aaron Chu, co founder of Coinhaul and I paraphrased Clickhouse is significantly outperformed other databases. We tested and delivered 40 times the cost savings and Clickhouse is a clear winner. Thank you Aaron. And congratulations on the acquisition yesterday.
00:02:49.793 - 00:03:16.395, Speaker A: They are being acquired by Jupyter Exchange and I just learned about it yesterday. So Crypto House is not just about Clickhouse. We partner with goalsky that provides us the data through their real time data pipeline. The core product is called Mirror. It is reorg aware, supports multiple sync and also it's easy to configure. So you can visit cryptohouse@crypto.clickhouse.com over there you can write SQL queries against blocks, transactions, tokens, tables.
00:03:16.395 - 00:03:49.925, Speaker A: Basically all the tables that you see there, the results that you see are returned real time, computed real time. There's no batching, there's no waiting for answers. We also have simple visualization for you to consume the data. We put in quotas at a database level to ensure fair usage. We welcome you to contribute queries over at our GitHub repository. And now let's cut over to the demo. All right, so this is Crypto House.
00:03:49.925 - 00:04:18.423, Speaker A: On the left you see a list of tables available for you to query on the next tab. These are some of the pre made queries that you get to run. So let's have a look at the number of transactions. All right, we have over 300 billion rows all stored in Clickhouse. Let's have a look at some of the sample blocks over here. This is the editor you are free to put in your query, like what I'm doing here. And let's have a look at some of the latest blocks.
00:04:18.423 - 00:04:52.741, Speaker A: So yes, we get to see the latest blocks being ingested into Clickhouse. There's also charts for you to view the data. And let's take a look at one of the more expensive queries. Let me just give it a try. So this is a query that runs and looks for the most active account within a day. As you can see we are reading over 72 million rows, but actually we are processing over 1.2 billion rows at the back end because we are doing an array join within wow, 7 seconds we already got the top account that have the most number of absolute balance changes.
00:04:52.741 - 00:05:16.385, Speaker A: Pretty good. If you like to, you can also share your query or save your query at the browser. Let's cut back to the last slide. Okay, so for more information, if you mean if you have any issues with quotas or if you like to lay your hands off the data, feel free to contact Goalsky. Otherwise I welcome you to experience ClickHouse@Crypto.ClickHouse.com thank you.
