00:00:00.280 - 00:00:17.214, Speaker A: We're live. Oh, we got Max as well. Look, one more team. All right, let me just make sure the twitch folks can see us. I still see the background live stream starting soon, but I see Austin as well on the top. You guys see us? Okay, cool. All right.
00:00:17.214 - 00:00:24.630, Speaker A: Hey, mango team, welcome. Good to have you on today. We have here from the mango team, Max Schneider and Nick Feeney. Welcome, guys.
00:00:24.822 - 00:00:25.594, Speaker B: Hey.
00:00:26.584 - 00:00:27.304, Speaker A: Hey, Nick.
00:00:27.344 - 00:00:28.904, Speaker C: Glad to be here. Thanks for having us.
00:00:28.984 - 00:00:29.416, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:29.480 - 00:00:35.484, Speaker A: Great to have you on. For those listeners that may not know, you want to tell the quick backstory of how those hats came to be.
00:00:37.064 - 00:01:07.280, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I think it was Maximilian's idea. We were thinking of just something fun to do and a lot of people were asking for mango nfts and we were like, okay, well, that's cool. But something physical could actually be even cooler. And then the play on words, people were also asking, win token. Win token. So we thought, April Fools, we can do an initial cap offering and also give the cap as the, as the cap offering.
00:01:07.280 - 00:01:17.164, Speaker C: And so we did that as a fun April fool's joke and it went well. And people are really liking the mango caps. Post them on their Twitter avatars and it's been a lot of fun.
00:01:17.504 - 00:01:21.154, Speaker A: Yeah, great. Thanks for the one you gifted me, by the way. Much appreciated.
00:01:22.174 - 00:01:23.166, Speaker C: No worries.
00:01:23.350 - 00:01:37.662, Speaker A: Right on, guys. Nick, if you're going to do the demo, feel free to share your screen and we can kick it off and show all these viewers on Twitch what you guys are about. And Max, if you want to tweet from the mango Twitter and let people know you're going live, feel free to do that as well.
00:01:37.838 - 00:01:40.274, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll cover your back. Go ahead.
00:01:41.494 - 00:01:51.578, Speaker C: Okay, so I'm actually going to have to share my screen. It's going to make me restart, so I'm going to have to do that real quick and just hop back up on Zoom.
00:01:51.666 - 00:01:53.014, Speaker B: Let's see if it works.
00:01:53.434 - 00:01:54.534, Speaker C: Oh, okay.
00:01:54.874 - 00:01:56.334, Speaker A: We see it. We see it.
00:01:56.874 - 00:02:31.080, Speaker C: Sweet. To really highlight how far we've come since the hackathon, this is our old version. This is what we submitted to the hackathon with, and it is pretty cool, but there's definitely some room for improvement. And here's the v two. And we were really excited to launch this. Before we get into some of the different mechanics of trading on the platform, I'd like to highlight some of the different customization options available. So first off, there's three different color themes.
00:02:31.080 - 00:02:39.534, Speaker C: We have the mango, the dark, and the light. So, Tristan, which one's your favorite that we should continue the demo.
00:02:39.614 - 00:02:41.194, Speaker A: I like mango, honestly.
00:02:42.414 - 00:03:13.754, Speaker C: Good call. I like the mango as well. And something else that's really cool is all these panels are totally customizable. So right here you can unlock the panels and you could drag them around, switch them around however you like, and it can always reset it, which is cool. And the other thing is our order book. You can switch whether it's side by side or top and bottom right here. I personally like the top and bottom one, makes a little bit more sense to me, so I like to leave it there.
00:03:13.754 - 00:04:00.304, Speaker C: And also our trading view, you can change all the, you have ten different timeframes, 4 hours, 1 hour, and all the different tools. And our trading view implementation is open source. And this is something that the community has really enjoyed. I think there's a few different sites using it and has been something that has been enjoyed. So we're happy to share that with the community and provide some value to some other founders that are looking to build on Solana. And so for those who don't know, Mango is leveraged trading as well as borrow lending infrastructure. And so to get started, we'll start with the borrow lend the trading.
00:04:00.304 - 00:04:46.648, Speaker C: And first you have a margin account which is used to deposit your collateral to be traded on the site. So if you just connect your wallet to the site, your funds aren't all available for collateral, independent liquidation or something like that. You have to specify which funds you're going to use. So we have three different walls to connect today. We'll go with phantom deposit some collateral, $100 to make it easy USDT. And something cool about mango is all deposits in your margin account earn interest. So you're down here.
00:04:46.648 - 00:05:28.416, Speaker C: These are the interest rates. The utilization is a little low for the BTC and ETH, so it's not quite there. But the borrows are really cheap, so that's attractive. And the we expect the utilization to sort of mellow out and find a good spot, but cool. So we deposited into our margin account and now we are going to make a trade. So we have limit and market orders. I place a little bit more market orders than I'd like to admit.
00:05:28.416 - 00:05:58.844, Speaker C: But today we'll do a limit order to show we'll do both. So let's see here. And we do have all the different charting goal trading view tools, so we can do a little hacky ta to see where we want to place our order. Okay, so it's looking like we could actually place along here. Probably going to do something like this. If you want some more. Great ta.
00:05:58.844 - 00:06:25.364, Speaker C: You're going to have to join the paid group, but. Cool. So let's open along. Let's go. And to make a leveraged trade, all you have to do is just place an order for more than your deposits. So right now I have $100 deposited. Go ahead and place a $200 do a market order just to make everything work fast.
00:06:25.364 - 00:07:03.874, Speaker C: And the $100 is going to be automatically borrowed to place the trade. So right here you can see in my margin account, everything already updated snappy. I have $109 borrowed and 0.0053 bitcoin deposited. And as time goes on, we'll be able to see this total p and l calculation go hopefully up. But that's going to track your account as far as based off your deposits, if you're making or maybe losing money. And then also in this panel is your leverage calculation.
00:07:03.874 - 00:07:35.266, Speaker C: And so I'm only at 1.1 x right now. Let's, let's up that. Let's see if we can make some money today. And also your collateral ratio, which is based off your positions and deposits over your borrows. Cool. So while that is going through and.
00:07:35.330 - 00:07:41.494, Speaker A: Also just to confirm, Nick, I could deposit bitcoin, ethereum and also use that as margin to place trades. Is that right?
00:07:41.914 - 00:08:14.044, Speaker C: Exactly. So you can deposit your bitcoin or your ethereum and soon to be sol and serum slight alpha leak. And right here is where you can switch between those. But yeah, you can just deposit your ETH. And if you want to buy some bitcoin, you just buy bitcoin. And with $0 of USDT deposited, they'll be automatically borrowed. And we can get into that also a little bit more talking about the borrow function.
00:08:14.044 - 00:08:35.214, Speaker C: And so we're here in the trade history. We see my first trade and the open orders. There's no open orders. We'll show what that is. We also have post and immediate or close and something else. So yeah, that went through now. And this trade history is cool.
00:08:35.214 - 00:08:44.594, Speaker C: So if you disconnect from the site and reconnect your wallet, all the trade history is still going to show up, which is something that people definitely like.
00:08:46.174 - 00:08:52.934, Speaker A: And rare on, I must say, because it's hard trade history. So for people listening, this is a really cool feature.
00:08:53.714 - 00:09:22.154, Speaker C: Right? So it's, and that's, that's key to our p and l. This was something that our alpha testers really highlighted how important it was for us. We, we were just testing and everyone was like, we need p and l. We need p and l. It's like, all right, so we definitely it wasn't easy, but it was worthwhile and exciting that we did, and. Cool. So now I'm up to two x leverage down a little bit, but no big deal.
00:09:22.154 - 00:10:15.286, Speaker C: And so now the other really cool thing about Mango is the borrow with borrow withdrawal borrowed funds. So it's really just like a lending borrow protocol as well. And when we first released this feature, some people were asking, why would we want to do this? So just a quick refresh there. Let's say you have bitcoin and you still want exposure to bitcoin or any other crypto, but if you want, you know, maybe if you just want to buy something in USDT, you could actually use your other cryptos as collateral and withdraw USDT. And sometimes it could be a really low leverage, so it's very unlikely that you get liquidated. And then as long as bitcoin or your other cryptos go up more than the interest on the USDT, which is super low right now in Mango, 3.71 annual, you're doing well.
00:10:15.286 - 00:10:49.314, Speaker C: And then also there's a bunch of other cool farming infrastructures all across the ecosystem. So you can withdraw your us, whichever alpha you scoundrel the crypto earth for, whether it's USDT, bitcoin, or ETH, you can withdraw that and farm with it and pay back your loans. And then you still didn't even. You didn't have to sell any of your cryptos to do it. Let's show that. So I'm already decently levered up here. Two x, and our max is five.
00:10:49.314 - 00:11:39.290, Speaker C: So if I did want to withdraw the max amount, you just go to. If you want to do this, you go to withdraw, enable borrowed funds and hit max. And so the max I could withdraw to bring my leverage to five x is $50. So I'll do that. It's a appropriate health check because my collateral ratio is going to be approaching 120%, and 110 is the maintenance. And let's say I didn't have any other borrows and open positions. If I just deposited my collateral, bitcoin or ETH, and I wanted to withdraw borrowed funds, it's about 4.8
00:11:39.290 - 00:12:08.794, Speaker C: x what you can borrow. That would be full leverage. And so now in my wallet is going to show my withdrawal funds. So they're already all there. So right there is the $50 I withdrew and paying. If I want to settle this borrow, I could either trade, sell my bitcoin for the borrow and settle it. Let's do that.
00:12:10.614 - 00:12:15.854, Speaker A: Nick, one question I'm seeing on twitch is, are these rates. Annualized or daily for the borrowers?
00:12:15.894 - 00:12:17.070, Speaker C: Yes, they're annual.
00:12:17.262 - 00:12:32.630, Speaker A: They are annual, listeners. And, Austin, I don't know if you're listening, but one thing for you, too, and I don't know if this is possible, but there's someone asking if it's possible to stream in higher definition. So I don't know if that is something we can do or not. I thought I'd put it out there. All right, sorry, Nick. Keep going.
00:12:32.742 - 00:12:39.234, Speaker C: Yeah, no problem. So now we're just showing how you can pay back your borrow.
00:12:40.254 - 00:13:01.390, Speaker B: I'm not sure it will work at this point because you're already at maximum leverage. So I think all trades are blocked at this point. Okay. I think you will only be able to deposit first. I think you need to, because, you see, you're already above five x. You're 5.02. Got it? Yeah.
00:13:01.390 - 00:13:24.266, Speaker B: Your account is already under, basically maintenance. Approaching maintenance. Right. It's below initial margin, so now only depositing is possible for a while. Maybe also a bit more background on the liquidations. By now, there are two liquidation bots that are open source. We just finished the second one recently.
00:13:24.266 - 00:14:05.148, Speaker B: This is a little bit more optimized and a little bit easier to understand. It's written in Python. It's a really good example of how to trade on mangle with Python, also on CRM Dex specifically. And we've seen a lot of people interested in running those liquidation bots we're super interested in have more people do it, because it means that the network gets safer. The more liquidators they're around, the better the funds of the lenders are protected. And so we encourage everyone to come on discord, check out the GitHub repos, and run a liquidator. I think that wasn't possible either.
00:14:05.148 - 00:14:11.384, Speaker B: When we launched, I think the liquidator was still closed source, so that's something developed only in the last two weeks.
00:14:15.684 - 00:15:14.530, Speaker C: So my deposits brought my leverage back below five x, so now I could do trade my bitcoin, sell my bitcoin, and settle the borrows and. Yep, so the borrows are cleared, and I'm back to my original deposits. These rates are really low, so if anyone's looking to do some farming, highly recommend checking out mango markets. And something else that's really cool is we have these custom margin alerts, so we'll create a new one, and you could set whichever ratio you want, whether it's some of the standard ones, or let's go with a more specific 113% collateral ratio. You could send to SMS, email, or telegram Maximilian is floating the SMS alerts right now, so take advantage of that.
00:15:14.642 - 00:15:21.454, Speaker A: But this is awesome, guys. I think people really, really, really appreciate this kind of stuff.
00:15:24.154 - 00:16:05.074, Speaker B: Yeah, we really want people to not get liquidated. Right. So part of it is technical solution, but part of it is also just making people aware of. Certainly for us, it was a bit like, how do you even know you're about to get liquidated? We don't have this classical margin call scenario. If you trade on Robinhood or something, they will literally send you an email and ask you to close a position. It's just not the level of support we have, but maybe telegram bot is as far as we can go and we hope everyone can trade a little bit more responsibly. It's always good to close the position before getting liquidated.
00:16:06.014 - 00:16:06.350, Speaker C: So.
00:16:06.382 - 00:16:06.954, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:10.094 - 00:16:58.564, Speaker C: And you can set as many alerts as you'd like. So that one is right here and then no triggered yet on this account. Smooth sailing. And, yeah, and another, if you're interested in learning more about mango, we have a lot of resources in our documentation, so we have an overview, and we also have really detailed trading tutorials frame by frame. So we really want to make sure that no one has any problems using the site. And if anyone does want to use it, they can documentation on our APIs and it's all there. Even our lightpaper is in there as well.
00:16:58.564 - 00:17:47.728, Speaker C: I'm going to have to. And we have our stats page also, which we're soon to have more statistics available. But right now we are able to track deposits and borrows, bitcoin, ETH and USDT. This blip here was immediately after we removed the borrow limits, someone opened up a massive five x long, and then luckily, our liquidator was able to manage that there. So that was a fun moment. And, yeah, there's quite a lot.
00:17:47.776 - 00:17:55.324, Speaker A: There's quite a bit of collateral there to borrow. Right, like, I'm seeing millions of. Is that right? Is there like several millions? A few millions of dollars?
00:17:55.744 - 00:18:11.924, Speaker C: Yes. Yep. Millions. There's millions available to borrow. Someone was generous enough to ape in and lower the interest rates to near zero. So definitely some opportunity there if anyone wants to take advantage of those interest rates. Yes.
00:18:12.874 - 00:18:22.454, Speaker A: That's huge. I love the fact that you can just go and borrow with, you know, cents or, sorry, less than cents, fractions of a cent transaction costs just to get these funds out.
00:18:22.914 - 00:18:23.814, Speaker B: Mm hmm.
00:18:25.554 - 00:18:39.794, Speaker C: Yeah, it's awesome. And utilize the Solana for that. And the serum Dex. The serum dex powers all the margin trading, so all trades on here are are on CRM DAX as well.
00:18:41.374 - 00:18:46.390, Speaker A: I see a request in the twitch chat. They're asking for an API to get historical stats.
00:18:46.502 - 00:18:47.750, Speaker C: I don't know how possible or hard.
00:18:47.782 - 00:18:49.834, Speaker A: That is, but just maybe something to note down.
00:18:51.934 - 00:19:10.854, Speaker B: Yeah, come on our discord and tell us more. We're about to revamp some of the statistics. The next thing we're implementing is account stats. So I want to give you a bit more info about what's happening in your account. And there's some historic stats on planned, but maybe we overlooked something and you really going need something, so reach out.
00:19:18.074 - 00:19:23.738, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Any, any other things you guys want to share? There's like 300 people listening, so please. And you guys got a little bit.
00:19:23.746 - 00:19:25.562, Speaker C: Of extra time because there was a.
00:19:25.578 - 00:19:30.494, Speaker A: Window between you and the next participants. So, you know, you guys have another ten minutes if you want to keep going.
00:19:32.444 - 00:20:11.106, Speaker C: Cool. So I guess we can maybe talk about what's coming for mango a little bit. We have Solana and serum on the way. Very soon we're testing on our Devnet and that'll be exciting. You'll be able to. It'll all be in the same group also, so you could just deposit your stolen serum and that will be available to cross margin trade on all these other assets. And right now we have a fee discounts tab where people are able to deposit their, contribute their serum and sort of lower the fees for other traders in the future.
00:20:11.106 - 00:20:52.214, Speaker C: Once the serum group is added, then just the deposits are. That'll move. The deposits and serum deposits will automatically earn interest and also say, help other traders save on some fees. And we're also, our perpetual futures are on the way. So that's something that we're all really excited about. And a lot of development focus has been there and super excited to start testing more publicly with people and share. That will be really cool and a lot of exciting stuff on the way.
00:20:52.924 - 00:21:09.464, Speaker A: Oh, there's one really cool comment here on twitch, guys. Would be dope to have Bonfito working with us to run bot trading on mango. That's actually really good idea. It would be really cool to have these bonfita bots be able to use margin so they can use leverage as well. Maybe a collaboration worth looking into.
00:21:10.404 - 00:21:30.978, Speaker B: Oh, that sounds interesting. Yeah, yeah, we're. I think for the, for the short term, the main thing we want to push out is these groups. Right, right. Like the increased group or like larger group with Solen serum. We always call it a group because really every. Every token in the basket counts as collateral.
00:21:30.978 - 00:22:06.622, Speaker B: Right. So you can do like, all these complex scenarios of, I don't know, maybe you want to be ultra long soul and really short eve. There's like tons of strategies people can express. And I think also FTX was like one of the first exchanges to get this really right. And, like, really every weird token you have in your account still counts as collateral to open another margin position. So you're kind of like, no matter on which side of any trade you are, you're always ready to open another trade. I think that's something that's really important for us.
00:22:06.622 - 00:23:03.052, Speaker B: And so we're planning to increase the number of tokens at the same time. It is an intense technical challenge. We're really pushing what Solana can do, and we're in very active conversation always Anatoly and Bartosz and Armani, just to get a little extra inch of performance out of the chain so our staff can have more tokens. So the struggle is going to continue for a while, but we hope to have vastly redesigned version of the contract on Devnet by mid June, end of June, kind of. And then start to collaborate more with market makers, liquidity providers for the perpetuals. They'll need people to provide liquidity. We already have some people interested, but we're still open to onboard more people.
00:23:03.052 - 00:23:47.464, Speaker B: So that's kind of, I'd say the big community activation in June will be bringing, like, a few more quantitative traders on the platform. And then, yeah, from there on, I hope we can launch perpetual swaps. I think perpetual future is such a big deal in crypto, really allows people to get the trading done really efficiently. Right. So we hope we can provide that too, and hopefully also seamlessly integrate with everything else. That's like one of our biggest hopes, that we can pull that off. That really feels like on a centralized exchange where it doesn't really matter if you're trading contracts or actual assets, it's all behind one seamless interface.
00:23:49.444 - 00:24:17.074, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super exciting, guys. And it's really nice to see how, excuse me, how all of this is developing. And I think another thing that maybe the viewers aren't super aware of that you guys do, quite uniquely, is how much you have your community contribute directly. So if anyone is interested in contributing to a cool serum based, solana based project, please go join the mango markets discord and talk with these guys, because they're always, always having people come help, and they're very receptive to it.
00:24:19.054 - 00:24:59.174, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. Nearly every week, someone shows up with a cool idea, and then the question is usually how can we empower them to to implement it? Recently someone came up with a really cool concept for stop losses, for instance, which was like a heavily requested feature. And yeah, it was generally like really good concept. So I'm super excited to help him get up to speed and start working on mangle. Everything is open source so people can just come in and hack it. Yeah. When there are any questions about the source code or something, reach out to me.
00:24:59.174 - 00:25:06.298, Speaker B: Gladly. Jump on a zoom and explain more. Bright. Wow.
00:25:06.346 - 00:25:25.914, Speaker A: Thank you so much, guys. We see a couple of comments here. Some were saying love the mango hat. We have some people asking for more merch, so obviously the wen token is probably the most asked question, but I won't even ask you about that because I think you'll have to do that whenever you're ready. Maybe more merch, though. People would appreciate that. If you guys want to do some other drops or something along those lines in the meanwhile.
00:25:25.914 - 00:25:33.514, Speaker A: And look, we have 310 listeners. That's really great. Anything else you guys want to share? If not, we're going to hand it off to the foresight guys.
00:25:34.214 - 00:25:35.594, Speaker B: Nick, you have anything?
00:25:36.654 - 00:25:52.168, Speaker C: Just a bunch of exciting stuff on the way and join our discord. And we love to hear from everyone and appreciate the support we've gotten so far. Excited to keep working and really build something awesome.
00:25:52.256 - 00:25:58.404, Speaker B: Yeah, same here. I here. Thank you, Kristen, for having us. Really great working with you.
00:26:00.664 - 00:26:12.344, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a pleasure. We'll do a catch up here maybe after all of these sessions, Max, if you're around. Okay, cool. I'll have the I'm going to tell the foresight guys to hop on. Feel free to hop off. And thank you so much for joining.
