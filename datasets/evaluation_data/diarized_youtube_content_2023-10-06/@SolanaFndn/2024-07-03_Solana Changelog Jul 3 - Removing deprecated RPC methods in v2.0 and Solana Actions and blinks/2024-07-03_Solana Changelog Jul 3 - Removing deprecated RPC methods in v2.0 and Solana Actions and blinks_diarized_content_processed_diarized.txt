00:00:03.960 - 00:00:11.486, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. GMGM. Welcome to the changelog. I'm Nick Frostbutter from the Solana foundation and today I've got Jonas with me. How are you doing, Jonas?
00:00:11.678 - 00:00:17.886, Speaker B: I'm doing great, thank you very much. Just came back from Ukraine and now we have like a nice, exciting changelog here.
00:00:18.038 - 00:00:20.198, Speaker A: Oh yeah, Ukraine blockchain week, wasn't it?
00:00:20.294 - 00:00:28.640, Speaker B: Yeah, it was really cool. The Kumika team was there, the encrypted conference. Yeah, very nice city. Very nice. Talented devs.
00:00:29.020 - 00:00:36.612, Speaker A: Awesome, love to see it. Let's go ahead and dive into the changelog. I see you got SiMD 148 already loaded up for us. Do you want to talk about it?
00:00:36.796 - 00:01:22.656, Speaker B: Yes. So this is some changes on how you can move stake and move leopards between different staking accounts. This is especially interesting for stake pool providers. So you can easily get a bunch of stake delegated and they can take parts of it to different validators. And yeah, this is a few changes here. So for example, it helps a little bit that no access leopards get stuck in delegated stake accounts because now it's changing it so that it's easier and more fluent. The only thing that was thought in the past about this, I think, was that there might be some problems if we get slashing in the future, but in the meantime, this will make it way easier to move stake around and you don't need to like unstake it and stake it again.
00:01:22.656 - 00:01:25.088, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's a really nice change.
00:01:25.264 - 00:01:26.384, Speaker A: Yeah, that'll be nice.
00:01:26.472 - 00:01:30.940, Speaker B: There'll probably be some discussions there later. And then. Did you see some nice commits?
00:01:31.480 - 00:01:56.670, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw quite a few in there. There was this one here, which is super important to point out to people now that version 2.0 of the agave runtime, the agave validator has been. The version has been cut. There's this pr that is actually going to start removing some of those deprecated RPC endpoints. Many of these RPC endpoints have been deprecated in favor of newer, more better RPC endpoints. And that code.
00:01:56.670 - 00:02:17.624, Speaker A: Now that we're doing semver version 2.0, start removing a lot of that deprecated code. Take a look at all of these RPC endpoints that are going to be removed, including also from web3 js. They're also going to be removed out of there soon. The deprecation warning has been in there for quite a while. On both of these, make sure you're not using these.
00:02:17.792 - 00:02:39.100, Speaker B: Yeah. Since many people of course ignore deprecation warnings. I know that like sometimes I do. Visual studio code is like cutting them through, but have a deep look at these. Like probably you still might use confirm transaction or get recent blockage or so on. So you might need to update these actually in the future. So yeah, just if you run into any errors there, this is the reason.
00:02:39.100 - 00:02:51.550, Speaker B: Then the next one we have here, update all crates to v two only version. So you might have seen there was a version upgrade to 2.0, but I think it broke a few things, right Nick?
00:02:51.970 - 00:02:54.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
00:02:54.930 - 00:03:27.010, Speaker B: So this is related to this pr here, which broke some dependencies because many of the packages actually have like the smaller or equal 2.0. And yeah, this broke in the last days, a bunch of dependencies, but this is now already fixed. So yeah, John Shinker went in and fixed it as quickly as possible. So it's very nice to see some versions have been yanked. So should be all fine again now, I think, hopefully. And then this one is interesting. What is it about?
00:03:27.790 - 00:04:18.596, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's, for those of you who don't know, there's within the compute budget section of the runtime, you can set your priority fee. People are pretty familiar with the priority fee. There's also functionality to adjust the specific data, the size of the data that you're loading within the accounts. When a validator goes to process transactions, it needs all the accounts in order to process them, but there's a maximum limit there. No one really uses this up until now because there's not really a huge benefit or detriment to use it and adjust the loaded account size. But now there is, uh, there's a feature gate that is open and it's gonna basically make it so the amount of data that you're requesting, account data size that you're requesting will actually affect your total compute usage within your transaction. So be sure to be watching out for that.
00:04:18.596 - 00:04:27.560, Speaker A: And if you are requesting lots and lots of account sizes or a very large account size, then you might start to notice things in the future once this feature gate gets activated.
00:04:27.980 - 00:04:43.126, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Before you could like just load like a bunch of 64 megabyte accounts. And I think you didn't really get paid for it. And I think they split it actually into two feature guides. So this is, I think what this is about. So in the future there might be some additional costs here to keep in mind.
00:04:43.278 - 00:04:44.550, Speaker A: Yep, absolutely.
00:04:44.670 - 00:04:47.918, Speaker B: And then who? Have you heard of actions? I think it's like all over the place.
00:04:47.974 - 00:04:49.570, Speaker A: I haven't heard of them at all. Yeah.
00:04:51.670 - 00:05:18.056, Speaker B: Definitely. And we collected like a few resources here that you can check out in the comments later. So here's, for example, a guide and a documentation on Solana.com. then we also have a video walkthrough where you just learn about it in 17 minutes. And then we also have a bunch of examples here. We're going to put all these links here. Basically what it is, is you can put a link anywhere on the Internet and it can trigger a Solana transaction.
00:05:18.056 - 00:05:22.800, Speaker B: At the moment, I think it's only on x. Right. Nick, do you want to give us a quick walkthrough?
00:05:22.880 - 00:05:41.110, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the gist of it. Basically, the idea of blanks and actions is bringing transactions to the users where they're already at. So in theory, it can be anywhere on the Internet. Right now, it is just limited to x.com. dot your Twitter feeds, your DM's on Twitter. Fun fact, it does work in DM's, which is really cool. Cool.
00:05:41.150 - 00:05:42.102, Speaker B: I didn't know it.
00:05:42.246 - 00:06:28.392, Speaker A: Yeah. So the idea is people can share a link that follows the action specification and that will basically render some special user interface directly in the Twitter feed and eventually on other platforms as well, where you can immediately interact with that link. You can create a slot on a transaction, you can send it to the blockchain. So you could think of sharing a link for a token swap, digital collectibles, donations for charity, voting on dao votes, all sorts of different powerful things directly to where people are. Yeah, blinks are incredibly powerful. We're really excited to help push this forward within the ecosystem and see what all the amazing things that people build and shout out for this last link here for the awesome repo. Awesome blinks.
00:06:28.392 - 00:07:00.460, Speaker A: If anyone is building anything that is blinks or action related, open a pr to this awesome blinks repo. We're going to start doing some of these within the salon ecosystem, the awesome repos, just to help collect a lot of the amazing things that our community is building. There's already some really great stuff on here from dialect. The heavy duty builders, they built this rust cli helper tool for creating links and creating blinks. You got D reader, truffle, tensor realms is on there. Helium, hip votes, a lot of great stuff. So if you're building anything with actions and blinks, open up pr.
00:07:01.160 - 00:07:23.092, Speaker B: I love this idea of these awesome repositories, actually. There's so many developers out there which are way better than us, and they can now absolutely collect it all here and we are just supporting it a little bit. This is really, really cool. Another thing that you can build with blinks, by the way, is games. Of course. Yes, you can. And when you hear this, the game gem will actually be in full force already.
00:07:23.092 - 00:07:48.702, Speaker B: And there will be a track for Blinks as well, probably, so you can try to make a game with blinks. Shout out to Spacemandev, by the way, who did like a live stream yesterday building the first game. Hopefully by now it will be open source already. Yeah. Building in public is always amazing. And we have like, in real life game gems in Istanbul, in Turkey, in Munich, in Germany, in Berlin, in Germany, in New York and. Yeah.
00:07:48.702 - 00:08:11.454, Speaker B: And in UK, of course, that's the biggest one directly. It will end on the last day, on the first day of the hackathon, actually, and then going into this very game themed hackathon hacker house in London. So if you haven't yet book your flights, it's going to start in three days, I think, when the video comes out, so there's not too much time left. Yeah, it's going to be a great game jam, I think.
00:08:11.622 - 00:08:15.388, Speaker A: Yeah, the game jams always have really great things that get put out for them.
00:08:15.494 - 00:08:16.160, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:08:16.280 - 00:08:29.780, Speaker A: Last but not least here is stack exchange, obviously. Shout out to stack exchange and everyone who is doing amazing work over there. We got Jimmy leading the. Leading the charge again. Ari, Joey, Chalda. Got that Jonas guys on there again. He's all right.
00:08:29.780 - 00:08:34.500, Speaker A: Yeah. Good work on everyone on stack exchange, answering all these questions.
00:08:35.640 - 00:08:41.129, Speaker B: Everyone is here. Yeah. Thank you so much, everybody, for helping the developers here. It's really great.
00:08:41.319 - 00:08:44.965, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's going to wrap it up for this week on the changelog and we'll catch you next time.
00:08:45.157 - 00:08:46.125, Speaker B: See you next week. Bye.
