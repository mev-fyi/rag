00:00:01.880 - 00:00:03.294, Speaker A: Hi everyone. I'm Eugene.
00:00:03.414 - 00:00:05.094, Speaker B: I work at Ellipsis Labs.
00:00:05.174 - 00:00:12.510, Speaker A: We are core contributors to Phoenix, the leading order book decks on Solana. Today, I'm going to talk about the.
00:00:12.542 - 00:00:15.422, Speaker B: Problems in decentralized finance and how to.
00:00:15.438 - 00:00:20.014, Speaker A: Fix them at Ellipsis Labs.
00:00:20.054 - 00:00:25.918, Speaker B: We're still suckers for this vision for DeFi that was articulated in 2020 and 2021.
00:00:26.086 - 00:00:28.926, Speaker A: DeFi promised us a financial system that.
00:00:28.950 - 00:00:32.954, Speaker B: Is open, transparent, credibly fair, and auditable.
00:00:33.494 - 00:00:49.246, Speaker A: These are all properties that come from building on top of decentralized infrastructure. But DeFi has thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We sacrifice way too much in all other dimensions. Yes, today DeFi is decentralized, but the.
00:00:49.270 - 00:00:55.624, Speaker B: User experience is drastically worse than it is in tradfi, and all the protocols are unsustainable.
00:00:57.604 - 00:01:00.732, Speaker A: DeFi has delivered a decentralized financial playground.
00:01:00.788 - 00:01:02.212, Speaker B: Not a financial system.
00:01:02.388 - 00:01:09.812, Speaker A: It allows for permissionless access and innovation. But DeFi needs to grow up. It can't be a sandbox forever.
00:01:09.948 - 00:01:12.524, Speaker B: We need to deliver a better financial system.
00:01:12.684 - 00:01:14.588, Speaker A: DeFi needs to outperform tradfi.
00:01:14.676 - 00:01:15.652, Speaker B: This is our core mission.
00:01:15.708 - 00:01:17.144, Speaker A: At Ellipsis Labs.
00:01:19.384 - 00:01:20.416, Speaker C: We believe that Defi.
00:01:20.440 - 00:01:22.288, Speaker B: Is cryptos killer application.
00:01:22.416 - 00:01:26.112, Speaker A: Traditional finance is broken because it's built on top of this 10 zero year.
00:01:26.128 - 00:01:29.184, Speaker B: Old pile of technical and institutional debt.
00:01:29.344 - 00:01:37.616, Speaker A: It's filled with entrenched rent seekers who have veto power over any changes. The way DeFi outcompetes tradfi is by.
00:01:37.640 - 00:01:40.016, Speaker B: Enabling rapid, permissionless innovation so we can.
00:01:40.040 - 00:01:42.168, Speaker A: Move faster than tradfi, leading to better.
00:01:42.216 - 00:01:45.524, Speaker B: Primitives, better products, and better user outcomes.
00:01:47.904 - 00:01:52.432, Speaker A: At the protocol layer, Defi needs to compete with tradfi on quality of liquidity.
00:01:52.568 - 00:01:53.924, Speaker B: As well as sustainability.
00:01:54.344 - 00:02:00.176, Speaker A: In the steady state, the system needs to work without incentives. User experiences in DeFi need to be.
00:02:00.200 - 00:02:09.164, Speaker B: On par with or better than they are in tradfi. In particular, decentralization alone is not enough to win.
00:02:09.624 - 00:02:35.168, Speaker A: So in this talk, I'm going to focus on Defi. How DeFi can compete with tradfi, specifically in trading. In any trading system, there's liquidity supply and liquidity demand. Liquidity providers make money by capturing spread while losing money to toxic flow. In tradfi today, most trading occurs on order books. Liquidity providers place limit orders, rapidly placing.
00:02:35.256 - 00:02:37.536, Speaker B: And canceling orders in a competition to.
00:02:37.560 - 00:02:50.154, Speaker A: Provide better prices to users while also avoiding toxic flow. But in Defi, most trading occurs on automated market makers, or amms.
00:02:50.734 - 00:02:53.326, Speaker B: Amms are really designed under the constraints.
00:02:53.350 - 00:02:55.726, Speaker A: That were imposed by Ethereum mainnet.
00:02:55.870 - 00:02:58.886, Speaker B: Because Ethereum only supports 20 transactions per.
00:02:58.910 - 00:03:03.454, Speaker A: Second, passive liquidity is required on AMms.
00:03:03.534 - 00:03:05.846, Speaker D: Liquidity is specified with liquidity curves like.
00:03:05.870 - 00:03:09.026, Speaker A: Uniswap's original XY equals kick.
00:03:09.026 - 00:03:11.456, Speaker E: This way, liquidity providers never need to.
00:03:11.480 - 00:03:16.564, Speaker B: Update their quotes, they never need to update their orders. Prices are determined purely by trading activity.
00:03:19.224 - 00:03:30.088, Speaker A: On Amms, liquidity providers have a fixed spread, and because liquidity providers can't constantly update their quotes without paying large gas costs, AMM spreads are a lot higher.
00:03:30.136 - 00:03:35.164, Speaker B: Than spreads on centralized exchanges, and in particular there's no mechanism for price improvement.
00:03:35.644 - 00:03:36.956, Speaker A: So on the left here we see.
00:03:36.980 - 00:03:40.228, Speaker D: Uniswap'S liquidity on the ETH USDC pair.
00:03:40.396 - 00:03:42.612, Speaker B: On the right we see binance's far.
00:03:42.668 - 00:03:46.064, Speaker D: Superior liquidity on the ETH USDT pair.
00:03:46.404 - 00:03:52.704, Speaker B: And there's no reason for a reasonable user to trade on Uniswap when the prices are so much worse than they are on binance.
00:03:55.044 - 00:04:05.268, Speaker A: So Amms have higher spreads than centralized exchanges, but their liquidity is also unsustainable. With passive liquidity, LP's depend on other.
00:04:05.316 - 00:04:08.824, Speaker B: Traders to move their prices towards the current market price.
00:04:09.284 - 00:04:11.932, Speaker A: The chain itself has no direct visibility.
00:04:12.028 - 00:04:13.908, Speaker B: Into the state of the external world.
00:04:14.036 - 00:04:20.300, Speaker A: So active traders are the way this off chain information like the current price on binance makes it on chain.
00:04:20.492 - 00:04:22.052, Speaker B: This creates a bunch of trades that.
00:04:22.068 - 00:04:28.092, Speaker A: Are super unprofitable for AMM LP's. So in this picture, we see losses.
00:04:28.148 - 00:04:31.794, Speaker D: For Uniswap liquidity providers on the ETH USDC pair.
00:04:32.134 - 00:04:33.518, Speaker E: This in theory should be one of.
00:04:33.526 - 00:04:35.934, Speaker D: The most profitable pairs for Uniswap LP's.
00:04:35.974 - 00:04:38.354, Speaker A: Because there's a lot of non toxic flow.
00:04:38.774 - 00:04:45.294, Speaker B: But in this time period they lost tens of millions of dollars by markout p and l. This means that providing.
00:04:45.334 - 00:04:48.886, Speaker A: Liquidity on amms is generally unprofitable, and.
00:04:48.910 - 00:04:52.034, Speaker B: So the current system is unsustainable without incentives.
00:04:54.294 - 00:04:56.822, Speaker A: So DeFi amms are worse for both.
00:04:56.878 - 00:05:00.714, Speaker B: Makers and takers compared to tradfi compared to centralized exchanges.
00:05:01.234 - 00:05:03.250, Speaker A: This defi system is really bad for.
00:05:03.282 - 00:05:07.834, Speaker B: Users in the current state. There's no way it's going to compete with traditional finance.
00:05:07.994 - 00:05:21.818, Speaker A: Amms leak way too much value out of the system. So how do we fix this? There's multiple ways to make defi more competitive with tradfi. The Ethereum approach that we're seeing today.
00:05:21.946 - 00:05:27.274, Speaker B: Is to move critical components off chain to get around Ethereum's infrastructure constraints.
00:05:27.434 - 00:05:29.986, Speaker A: Some examples include fully off chain RFQ.
00:05:30.050 - 00:05:32.714, Speaker B: Systems like Uniswap X, off chain order.
00:05:32.754 - 00:05:35.570, Speaker A: Books like Dydx, as well as consolidation.
00:05:35.642 - 00:05:37.614, Speaker B: Of proprietary order flow.
00:05:39.154 - 00:05:48.494, Speaker A: These systems sacrifice permissionless access and composability, which is the whole value prop for defi anyway. They aggressively trade off decentralization for performance.
00:05:48.954 - 00:05:51.094, Speaker C: This is defi dystopia.
00:05:53.374 - 00:05:55.566, Speaker A: The Solana approach is to relax the.
00:05:55.590 - 00:05:58.318, Speaker B: Infrastructure constraint on high throughput blockchains.
00:05:58.366 - 00:06:01.486, Speaker A: Like Solana, developers can build liquidity primitives.
00:06:01.510 - 00:06:04.634, Speaker B: That deliver superior liquidity compared to Amms.
00:06:04.974 - 00:06:09.954, Speaker A: High throughput and low fees at the base layer really expand the protocol design space.
00:06:10.734 - 00:06:13.830, Speaker E: This way we can design efficient fully.
00:06:13.862 - 00:06:16.214, Speaker B: On chain protocols to maintain the permissionless.
00:06:16.294 - 00:06:22.344, Speaker A: Access and composability of DeFi, and we can make DeFi competitive with centralized exchanges.
00:06:23.244 - 00:06:25.264, Speaker C: This is Defi utopia.
00:06:27.604 - 00:06:32.036, Speaker A: Specifically on chain order books allow us to preserve the properties of DeFi that.
00:06:32.060 - 00:06:35.824, Speaker B: We really care about, like permissionless access and innovation.
00:06:36.324 - 00:06:39.220, Speaker A: Liquidity providers can place limit orders exactly.
00:06:39.252 - 00:06:41.148, Speaker B: Where they want to instead of having.
00:06:41.196 - 00:06:50.222, Speaker A: High fixed spreads like Amms, market makers now compete for flow by providing better prices to takers because market makers need.
00:06:50.238 - 00:06:55.710, Speaker B: To send a transaction to the blockchain every time they want to update their orders on chain order books are only.
00:06:55.782 - 00:07:09.318, Speaker A: Feasible on a chain that has high throughput and low fees. Order books in DeFi today are only possible on Solana. Here we see the Phoenix Sol USDC order book.
00:07:09.446 - 00:07:18.574, Speaker B: This order book is fully on chain as traders make actions on markets all around the world, Phoenix market makers react and adjust their on chain prices.
00:07:18.914 - 00:07:20.626, Speaker E: These adjustments can be made quickly and.
00:07:20.650 - 00:07:24.054, Speaker A: Cheaply, so market makers can provide very tight spreads.
00:07:24.914 - 00:07:30.414, Speaker B: Solana's low block times and fast confirmations uniquely enable a better user experience.
00:07:32.714 - 00:07:52.182, Speaker A: So let's take a look at the quality of liquidity with on chain order books. DeFi liquidity can be competitive with centralized exchange liquidity. Here we see Phoenix's liquidity on the sole USDC pair compared to binance liquidity on the sole USDT pair. Binance definitely still has more liquidity than.
00:07:52.198 - 00:07:54.190, Speaker B: Phoenix, but the spreads are actually tighter.
00:07:54.262 - 00:08:01.198, Speaker A: On Phoenix, which means takers are getting better prices. Once again, we still want to evaluate.
00:08:01.246 - 00:08:04.854, Speaker B: Protocol sustainability, so we're going to look at markouts.
00:08:05.194 - 00:08:14.934, Speaker A: On the left we see Phoenix market makers are profitable on the sole USDC pair. On the right, we see that Orca LP's lose money on the same pair.
00:08:15.914 - 00:08:17.914, Speaker B: And fundamentally, the reason that active market.
00:08:17.954 - 00:08:20.754, Speaker A: Makers are more profitable than AMM LP's.
00:08:20.874 - 00:08:22.122, Speaker C: Is because they're able to move their.
00:08:22.138 - 00:08:28.290, Speaker A: Own quotes rather than paying the market to do it for them. Again, this active liquidity is uniquely enabled.
00:08:28.322 - 00:08:30.014, Speaker B: By Solana's high performance.
00:08:33.334 - 00:08:44.270, Speaker A: Defi today is at a crossroads. We can embrace ethereum maximalism, which means accepting off chain systems, uncompetitive liquidity and unsustainable liquidity.
00:08:44.422 - 00:08:46.314, Speaker C: This is Defi dystopia.
00:08:47.054 - 00:08:56.372, Speaker A: Or we can pragmatically pick high throughput blockchains, expanding the protocol design space, enabling on chain systems that can be competitive with Tradfi.
00:08:56.518 - 00:08:58.324, Speaker C: This is Defi utopia.
00:09:01.224 - 00:09:18.224, Speaker A: First, we need to acknowledge that DeFi today is not good enough. What that means for us on Solana is that we need to stop copying Ethereum Defi protocols that were first and foremost designed for a blockchain that does 20 tps. Instead, for DeFi to out compete tradvi.
00:09:18.304 - 00:09:30.378, Speaker B: We need to embrace high throughput blockchains and the superior protocols that they enable. By leaning into permissionless innovation, we can create better financial primitives, better products, and better user outcomes.
00:09:30.546 - 00:09:41.690, Speaker A: This is the only way we can reach product parity and eventually far superior products to tradfi. We can actually build this better financial system with open access, transparency, and permissionless.
00:09:41.722 - 00:09:45.214, Speaker B: Innovation, and it's only possible on Solana.
00:09:46.674 - 00:09:47.074, Speaker A: Thank you.
