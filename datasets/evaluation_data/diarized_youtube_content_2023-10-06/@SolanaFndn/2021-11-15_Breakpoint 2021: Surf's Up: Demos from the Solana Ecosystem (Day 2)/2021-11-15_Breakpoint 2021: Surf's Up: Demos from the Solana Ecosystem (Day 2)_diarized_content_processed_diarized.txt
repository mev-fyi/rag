00:00:06.160 - 00:00:43.752, Speaker A: As Olivetina mentioned, we have a series of pretty awesome demos coming up for you right now. Before that, I wanted to take a quick second and actually shout out Alevtina herself. She's been a pretty huge part of making all of this happen. So if you see her afterwards, grab her a free coffee or one of the free drinks or something and just say thank you. Let's get started with the demos right away. First off, we have harsh he is a serial entrepreneur, over eleven years experience and he'll be walking us through the Ethereum push notification service and it's future on Solana Arch.
00:00:43.808 - 00:00:44.088, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:00:44.136 - 00:00:44.924, Speaker A: Take it away.
00:00:45.304 - 00:01:35.364, Speaker B: Thanks Andrea. Hey everyone. So yeah, we are ethereum push notification service, but you are considering we are on Solana, let's call it everything push notification service. What we are and what we do, we'll get to it in a while. Before that we'd like to begin everything with some goodbye video. So we have something for you guys. Awesome.
00:01:35.364 - 00:02:03.144, Speaker B: Hopefully you guys liked it. So yeah, moving to the problem we are solving. Well, we are solving the problem of communication or the lack of it. Just think about it. When you are on Web 2.0, everything happens from notification. You get up in the morning, you see your gmail, you get up, you order something, you see notifications on Amazon, your loan expires, you get a notification from your bank.
00:02:03.144 - 00:02:31.534, Speaker B: Something which we all do is WhatsApp chat and facetime calls. But surprise, surprise, that also happens through notification. But that's Web 2.0. When you come to Web 3.0, this is absent, there's no communication layer and because of that critical info drops away. Well, if you are into defi, your loan liquidates and you don't get to know about it. If you are into governance again, proposals will come and go.
00:02:31.534 - 00:03:20.838, Speaker B: You don't get to know about it. Something as basic as you sending crypto and receiving crypto, you don't get to know about that. And something as critical as your crypto exploits or smart contract bugs you as a user or a wallet address, don't get to know about that. So what's the solution for that? Well, for web3, creating a new primitive which is a decentralized communication protocol that can first enable notifications to user wallets and they've onwards chat, decentralized video and so much more. We did that for you guys. What we built is an open communication layer which can be tapped by any crypto front end. And this protocol can allow you as a wallet address to receive notifications.
00:03:20.838 - 00:03:58.448, Speaker B: Whether you are on Solana, whether you are on Ethereum, whatever blockchain you choose to be, then yeah, if we have to compete with Web 2.0, we have to become like them. That means that we need to have these notifications as dynamic. It doesn't have to be just text. Imagine when you wake up in the morning, a proposal comes in and in that notification you have a yes and no. That's possible now because of us. And of course we had to make it multi chain and platform agnostic just because crypto wallets and blockchain, they are two different beasts.
00:03:58.448 - 00:04:33.074, Speaker B: And any crypto wallet should show all the notifications that's coming, coming to you. So yeah, how do we do that? Not simple, but let me explain. So there's this EPN score. This is our smart contract residing on Ethereum. This enables governance for all the channels that want to send notification. Then we have something called epNs.com. It's a relatively simple contract that is deployed on every chain along with EPN, Scom SDK that enables off chain notifications.
00:04:33.074 - 00:05:09.194, Speaker B: And at the center of it are push nodes. These are open p, two p communication nodes that are validating, that are listening to epNs.com. And whatever things are coming in, they are validating and finally admitting it into the network. And after that, very simple. Any crypto wallet can just tap into it and can just listen and show these notifications to you guys. Little bit more about us. So we are backed by a lot of awesome web3 leaders, including Balaji, Sandeep, finance provinces and so on.
00:05:09.194 - 00:05:49.514, Speaker B: We started from Ethereum and we are so grateful to have such a cool partnership list. We are working with Uniswap, Gitcoin, Polygon, Aave, Makerdao, everyone to enable decentralized notifications to wallet address. No matter if you are adapt, smart, contract, backend or anything else. If you want to build chat, if you want to build decentralized video, ePNSP protocol is a new communication stack that needs to be in web3. Okay, so, time to show you what you as a user should expect. So this is a video about dapp. Let me just play it out.
00:05:49.514 - 00:06:19.214, Speaker B: So very simple. You can go on any crypto dapp and any crypto front end. Right now we are in our front end. And let's say you want to opt in for a notification. What you have to do is just opt in, sign the message with your wallet and that's it, you're done. You're all ready to receive notification on the crypto wallet of your choice. For example, this is our mobile app listening to EPNS protocol and Aave notification just went by.
00:06:19.214 - 00:06:56.104, Speaker B: All right, but what happens if you are a developer? Well, it's a little more complex in that sense, but let's see how the journey looks like. So let's say you are a breakpoint wallet. Solana believes in multi chain. So let's say breakpoint wanted to create a notification layer on Ethereum connected with Solana. So right now breakpoint is just creating their channel. Essentially it's a front end. Everything is getting communicated on the protocol level as well as a push node level.
00:06:56.104 - 00:07:33.826, Speaker B: What you have to do is you have to stake some amount of Dai, which is stablecoin. There's a cool theory about that. Whenever any services are staking Dai, we basically lend it out to Aave. We generate the interest and the interest is getting split proportionally among token holders. Once you do that, of course, we are just trying to speed up the entire Ethereum process. But yeah, once you have created a channel, because you are on Solana, you have to do one more verification checkpoint. I'm not going to go into that.
00:07:33.826 - 00:07:59.778, Speaker B: Instead I'm going to just show you how Solana notification works. So yeah, you have created the channel. Now what you need to do is run a couple of scripts. Again, we are coming on Solana. So because of that, this is just a PoC in process. Once we are there, you just need to use our SDK or just use our Dapp or create your own. Again, it's an open communication protocol.
00:07:59.778 - 00:08:34.108, Speaker B: So right now what we did was we verified the channel. Once the verification of the channel was done, the user, which is a wallet address we just called our push node, indicated that we have subscribed to the channel. And that's about it. After that I can send any notification from anywhere. So yeah, right now we are just sending the notification. The payload is content and storage independent. So over here it's getting uploaded to ipfs, but it can be smart contract bytes.
00:08:34.108 - 00:09:15.566, Speaker B: It can be anything which you want. And yes, once that's done, this is our browser extension. In theory, even metamask or trust or phantom or any other wallet can just tap into it and can just show how notifications look like. So yeah, as you can see, we just sent out some notifications and you can see the notifications in action. So, yeah, all right, so one more demo. This is again just a demonstration of how powerful and flexible the network is. You can even send a manual payload just like I defined, like the EPN is.com.
00:09:15.566 - 00:09:48.700, Speaker B: You can use the SDK or you can just generate a payload and send it out to the network. And the network will essentially validate everything and show the notifications out. So, yeah, that's the demo, guys. We love to do Alpha drop. So, yeah, we launched phase Zero, which was our governance of our push token. Then our mainnet is audited. We are coming very soon on Ethereum, followed by, of course, Polygon and Solana.
00:09:48.700 - 00:10:09.324, Speaker B: And, yeah, future plans. We have these push nodes that form the open communication layer. We want to enable stacking, staking and slashing on it because, of course, we want this to be decentralized. Thank you so much. You can follow us on EPNS project, telegram and Twitter. That's it. Thanks, guys.
00:10:12.064 - 00:10:27.066, Speaker A: Harsh. Thanks so much. Harsh. That was really good. Let's head over here to let Vidor get set up. Can you talk to us a little bit about why you're building this on Solana now? And maybe a little more detail around the timeline for when we can expect it on Solana?
00:10:27.210 - 00:10:51.948, Speaker B: Sure. So the future is multi chain, and I'm also seeing a lot of innovative developers coming on Solana. And what our vision is that this needs to be a de facto web3 communication stack. So of course, Solana makes that much more sense in terms of when we are launching on Solana. I mean, the POC is done. So hopefully very, very soon.
00:10:52.036 - 00:10:53.828, Speaker A: Cool. Awesome. Thank you so much.
00:10:53.916 - 00:10:54.356, Speaker B: Thanks, Andrew.
00:10:54.380 - 00:11:23.344, Speaker A: Appreciate it. All right, for our next demo, we have a somewhat legendary Solana builder already. He's been building full time on blockchain since 2016. He's the founder of Solarize Finance, which of course has built not only Solarize finance, but Soleflare and Solana beach as well. Vidor will be presenting solarize finance today, and I'll let you take it from here.
00:11:24.484 - 00:12:19.366, Speaker C: Thanks, Andrea. Thanks everyone for coming. And for everyone tuning in online, I will be demoing our app, which is solarise finance. In essence, it is a decentralized asset management protocol, so that can mean many things, but ultimately, our goal and vision is to provide good investment opportunities to the wider masses. In our platform, two types of users exist, fund managers and investors. I'm going to quickly go through the platform and I'm going to first show how one can create a fund and then how one can invest in some of those investment funds. The thing is, and our goal is to make investing really easy, like one click of a button and the other side, we on the fund manager side, we aim to provide all the tools to fund managers that they would use in their day to day trading activities.
00:12:19.366 - 00:12:50.614, Speaker C: So let's get started. Initially, when you load the app, what you can see is a list of funds that people have created and deposited money into. You can sort it by fees, aum, total profit or performance. As you see, there more than 500 funds currently on our main deployment. So let's then just go right in and create a fund. You might see that I already have two funds created. I'll create a new one.
00:12:50.614 - 00:13:23.034, Speaker C: Click there. Let's call it hello breakpoint. And I want to set a specific performance fee. So, performance fees, as you probably all know, are basically what percentage of the total profits the fund manager takes from managing user funds. We're a good guy, so let's go with 5%. It asks for a confirmation, and I just go create a fund. Obviously, it's connected to my soleflare wallet, and it asks me to approve the transaction.
00:13:23.034 - 00:13:44.632, Speaker C: Everything's blazing fast since we're leveraging the throughput, speed and very low transaction fees of Solana. So this is my investment fund. As you see, I currently, as a seed deposit, have only $1 in it. Let's try to do some other things. So, for example, let me see. I want to trade assets. Currently, these are the assets that are available on the platform.
00:13:44.632 - 00:14:26.678, Speaker C: We are working on adding more. Let's see, what are the tokens we like? Obviously, Solana serum. Let's go with radium as well. I want to add these tokens to the funds portfolio, meaning that now I can trade the initial capital within the fund, within these assets. So while these are being created, let me quickly show you how an investor would look at the fund. So they would look at the fund and they would see, let me quickly open my previous fund that's called Beth Jesus, and they would see this fund is performing positively. This is the strategy that they're using.
00:14:26.678 - 00:14:57.394, Speaker C: This is their asset composition. I would want to invest in this. So it's just a one click invest. You choose the amount of dollars you want to invest, let's say $200 into Beth Jesus, and I click deposit. I approve the transaction. And I mean, what now happens that I'm getting a specific share of the fund while all my deposited dollars follow the composition of the fund. So that fund currently has Sol serum, Ray Cope and mango in the respective distributions.
00:14:57.394 - 00:15:49.492, Speaker C: Okay, let's now quickly go back and see, as a fund manager, what I'm here able to do. So currently, solarise is built in a generic fashion where, as I previously said, we want to allow fund managers to have all the tools that they would use in their day to day trading activities. We initially started with just integrating with the serum Dex and radium, so we are able to use serum swap and radium swap to manage your assets. So currently this fund has 300 unallocated dollars. Let's maybe buy some soul and arrange the portfolio. In that sense, let's say $200. So you might see this balance of $300 will reduce by 200 and my balance of SOL will increase in the respective value.
00:15:49.492 - 00:16:20.434, Speaker C: This all in the backend happens through using radium swap. You might now think that, okay, but this is only swap. As a fund manager did many other things, and this is exactly what's in our roadmap. We're planning to add a more direct integration with serum Dex. In terms of long standing buy and sell orders. This is actually one of the biggest requirements on similar protocols in other chains. You just cannot have a longstanding buy or sell order on ethereum because, you know, stuff.
00:16:20.434 - 00:17:11.866, Speaker C: The other things we want to add is different protocols. We want to add borrow lending, we'll be adding perks, futures, options and all the fun stuff. So you see that my, as a manager of the Beth JSOs fund, my USDC balance decreased and I've bought in some solana. Currently we have trading, competition running, and basically people that want to manage their funds or basically create a track record before we unleash our platform to the wider masses can enroll and they can create their own fund and manage their assets. All the competition is incentivized by our own native token called solarize. For managers, on the other hand. Oh, okay, so let's then go quickly to the exit flow.
00:17:11.866 - 00:17:51.898, Speaker C: Okay, so now your manager has made a profit. You want to exit an investment. The exiting of the investment flow is pretty easy as well. You just go to the fund and then you click exit. You choose which of the accounts that you previously created or which investment account you want to exit. And you might notice an interesting thing here, and that is that we do not measure the performance of the whole pool of assets, because that's what we determine that big investment funds have a problem with. Because if you enter or exit at specific time periods when fund managers are claiming their performance, that you might miss out on some of the profits.
00:17:51.898 - 00:18:26.794, Speaker C: So we individually track investments and only charge fees on the realized profit of a single investment, which I think is a game changer. So let me choose this hundred dollar investment that I made and then exit it. I'm going to click through some steps because these are pretty complex transactions. I get a very big screen saying that my initial investment, my current value, ok, I'm at a loss. We didn't plan for this. We could have maybe had Solana pump a bit so we could demo this better. But it calculates the exit fees, the performance fees, and the total amount that I'm going to receive.
00:18:26.794 - 00:19:05.454, Speaker C: I click next. There are a few transactions that need confirmation. And actually, when I exit, there are two types of fees, exit fees and performance fees. Exit fees depend on how long you stayed in the fund, and performance fees are only on the realized profits. I won't go much into depth on how the three steps at the exit fees works, but I'm happy to catch up later if anyone wants to know more. So the final step is actually withdrawing all of these assets in the proportion that I had them to my treasury. I click withdraw to treasury and then, okay, sometimes RPC fails.
00:19:05.454 - 00:19:41.930, Speaker C: Maybe not, but ultimately when I fully exit that fund, I'm able to go in my treasury and see all my assets that I've withdrawn from the platform. We created this treasury mechanism as a separate vault on our platform so people can easier, in an easier fashion, track their overall profits. What I can do. Let me try one more time. Here we join to treasury. Okay, yeah, sorry. RPC happens.
00:19:41.930 - 00:20:18.480, Speaker C: So one more thing that I didn't mention. We also have a staking mechanism. And staking mechanism is something that we wanted to create that and incentivize people to have and lock our token. So when you stake the token, you are able to realize discounts across the whole platform. So we have a tiered structure of staking accounts. And the more you stake, the more discounts you can get while you're exiting the fund, for example. Or the more discounts you can get as a manager, that less of the performance fee cut gets given to gets taken from you.
00:20:18.512 - 00:20:19.164, Speaker A: Basically.
00:20:21.424 - 00:20:25.764, Speaker C: I would wrap it up there. I got more stuff to show, but the timer is ticking.
00:20:27.744 - 00:20:45.574, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks, Peter. That was awesome. Live demos are never easy, so great work. Can you walk us through a little bit how solarize plans on sort of integrating with other Solana protocols?
00:20:45.694 - 00:21:17.496, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely. I mentioned this partially, but we built our platform in a very generic way, meaning that it can facilitate the transactions through other protocols. So currently, if you go to the serum Dex, you are trading on your behalf. But in our case, you would be trading on the behalf of an investment fund, so it stays fully non custodial. And we also have checks that it sees that your funds won't go into, like a pro improperly balanced liquidity pool, for example. Also, this allows very easy integrations with other protocols like perps futures and whatever else I mentioned.
00:21:17.680 - 00:21:25.016, Speaker A: Awesome. As he said, go find him afterwards if you have any more questions. Also a great person to buy free coffee for. Thanks, Vidor.
00:21:25.080 - 00:21:25.884, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
00:21:29.544 - 00:21:39.694, Speaker A: All right, and next up, we have not one, but two builders and presenters, Cindy and Zee from drift protocol. Do you want to kick it away? Cool.
00:21:40.234 - 00:22:22.996, Speaker D: Yeah, sorry, just checking the thing is on. We're Cindy and Z. We're both co founders of Drift Protocol. We're building on chain perpetual swaps on Solana, and we use a pretty novel, dynamic Amm model that couples and built on virtual Amm on pos ETH iterations like perpetual protocol, bringing it fully decentralized on Solana and giving traders the best execution prize possible. So today we'll be going through just a quick introduction on who we are and where we're at. We recently just launched on Alpha Mainnet, so it's still closed. You need an NFT ticket to trade.
00:22:22.996 - 00:23:11.954, Speaker D: So if you need one and want to trade perps with five x, leverage on Solana, let us know after this and we'll send you an NFT. And yeah, where we're fully cross margin as well. So all of your positions within a collateral pool are tradable against each other. Your p and l from one position covers p and l everywhere, making the experience more capital efficient. So, yeah, we're really focused on bringing a fully transparent, highly liquid experience with low slippage and best execution prize for traders. And we're backed by multicoin job Capital, Alameda robot, and a bunch of the greatest trading desks in the space. So super excited to present our product here today.
00:23:11.954 - 00:23:22.914, Speaker D: So we'll be quickly walking through what we want to do. I'll let Z take over and I'll be controlling the screen.
00:23:23.824 - 00:23:24.256, Speaker C: Hi.
00:23:24.320 - 00:23:56.624, Speaker E: So Cindy is going to be showing you guys a live demo, and I can just kind of talk through kind of the set of features that you can do on a virtual amm for perp trading. So you can see right now in our closed mainnet, there's a cap on deposits. I guess we're going to deposit the max amount. You just approve the transaction. Super low fees. Thank you, Solana. So now we have ten k in our margin account.
00:23:56.624 - 00:24:51.494, Speaker E: This is just the collateral used for deciding how much of a position that you can take in this market. Yeah, so why don't we. We can see in the market, right? This is the sole market, and since this is a virtual amm, we have both a mark price and we use a reference index price coming from pith just to help with the price discovery process, you can see there's a predicted funding rate, and as you hover over it describes kind of what all these things mean when you're doing the perp trading. So, yeah, we see the funding rate is on the hour. It's ticking down 34 minutes until the top of the hour. We show that number as an APR as well, just for comparable reference. Right now, this means that longs are receiving near like over 100% annualized rate for holding a long.
00:24:51.494 - 00:25:10.166, Speaker E: Sounds great. You see other market statistics, right. The open interest in the market counted in the base asset amount, which is Sol, and the 24 hours volume in the quote amount, which is USDC. Yeah. So why don't you talk about for the trade that you're going to book?
00:25:10.270 - 00:26:00.698, Speaker D: Yeah, so just going to be a regular trader logging onto this exchange, taking a trade. So right now it looks like our mark price is below index price and we're getting paid to long Sol. And when is it not good to long solve? Do some quick ta. We have a trading view integration where you can, I'm not a TA expert, but you can draw some lines out there to inform your trading strategy whenever you guys like doing this. Looks like Sol just dumped a little bit, so I'm going to take a long. I think it's going to go back up, not financial advice. So I'm going to talk through the trading tab a little bit here.
00:26:00.698 - 00:26:44.024, Speaker D: So in the future, when we have more markets, you'll be able to select different markets to trade perps on. So right now we have Sol. In the future, we're going to have BDC, ETH, and a bunch of different DeFi assets in Solana as well as outside of Solana. With this, you can see the estimated entry price that you'll get in. So this also goes to show with a VMM, you know, the exact price that you're going to get in with without any worry about liquidity being pulled. And from there, you can also adjust what size of the position you want to take so you can easily type it in. It reflects in the position slider.
00:26:44.024 - 00:27:46.984, Speaker D: And then one thing you can do here as well, which is really interesting, is that you can select the max leverage that you want to put on your trade. So let's say you're really, you know, you want to take big risk on this trait and you want to go Max long five x, which is what we allow right now, and select that and feel free to do whatever you want. But today we're going to be a little bit more risk averse and take a two x long. So here it shows what slippage tolerance you're willing to take on your trade. Need to execute at a tight range. You can effectively simulate immediate or cancel limit orders that make sure that you don't get filled if price moves too fast while you're trying to execute a trade. So yeah, we're just going to quickly take a small position and I'm going to show you guys and maybe Z can talk through all these things here just to make sure you're familiar with.
00:27:46.984 - 00:27:47.066, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:47.090 - 00:28:17.734, Speaker E: So right before you confirm the trade, it'll tell you both the size that you're going to receive, the entry price that you're expected at, given that it's fully transparent, virtual amm, the slippage tolerance that you selected, we just selected infinite. And then the estimated slippage, which is purely, you can calculate beforehand. And then also because we're over collateralized on this trade, there is no liquidation price. So I guess we can just go along.
00:28:22.714 - 00:28:23.050, Speaker C: Sure.
00:28:23.082 - 00:28:50.424, Speaker D: Everyone's excited to see what the p and l is going to be in a couple minutes, but yeah, we're going to wait for the market to move a little bit before, oh, we meet $0.06 in profit, which is great. So, yeah, just going to wait for the market to sort of pick up. And we can also demo closing a position or taking an additional. Yeah, taking any additional positions which adds on or decreases your position.
00:28:56.924 - 00:28:59.028, Speaker E: You can also show, like, the trade history.
00:28:59.156 - 00:28:59.904, Speaker D: Yep.
00:29:00.884 - 00:29:01.236, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:01.260 - 00:29:17.564, Speaker E: So you can see at the bottom you have your position. You can see your trade history. Right. So if you have a bunch of trades, you can see all the trades that you booked, which. Or like the individual lots. There's also liquidations if you have been liquidated. We do have partial liquidations, which is very favorable.
00:29:17.564 - 00:29:30.444, Speaker E: It's kind of like an automatic stop loss on trading. And then the funding history. If you're holding a position for a long time, you'll be realizing the funding payment that we talked about earlier.
00:29:32.944 - 00:30:07.338, Speaker D: Yep. So all this information helps inform your trading history and lets you know what happened in the backend. We're also building a portfolio page where you can see all the traits that you've done all your p and l over time, and that should be released pretty soon. So excited to show it to you when it's live. So now I'm going to show how we close out a position. We initially built it so that you can close it out on the left side as well. So you can either take an opposing short position and close out the dollar 500 that you had long.
00:30:07.338 - 00:30:40.482, Speaker D: But in this case, we wanted to make it more convenient for users to be able to just close their position on the trading tab. So here you can see if you want to close out like half of your position or the whole thing. Let's see what it looks like when you want to close out half. Yeah. So your size just decreased from $500 notional to 250, and your p and l of $0.40 was realized and the rest is in an open position now. Yeah.
00:30:40.482 - 00:30:49.330, Speaker D: So that's pretty much the trading experience on drift. Yeah. Anything you want to add about idiosyncrasies of Emm?
00:30:49.522 - 00:31:04.984, Speaker E: Yeah, so we recently released docs and lots of other things so that people can build integrations on top of drift. So we're super excited to see what the community builds and just inspects.
00:31:07.964 - 00:31:44.494, Speaker D: Yeah. So the really cool thing about going open source and having a life SDK is that you guys can build trading bots that either ArP funding rates or take directional trades or also build liquidator bots. Liquidators get a reward of collateral for users that get liquidated. Obviously, we're really at risk averse today, but if a user was to be liquidated, we have a keeper network of liquidators who secure the network and receive rewards for securing the network. So this is all open source and anyone can participate in it. So if you're a trader builder, liquidator, you're welcome on drift.
00:31:46.754 - 00:32:07.474, Speaker A: Cool. Awesome. That was really good. Bring your laptop up here a second. I find this fascinating and have a million questions, but in the interest of fairness, I'm only allowed to ask one. So let's move up just a little bit. You're using a VMM.
00:32:07.474 - 00:32:12.406, Speaker A: Can you walk me through how it differs from an order book? Maybe?
00:32:12.550 - 00:33:02.834, Speaker D: Yeah. So VMm, you have zero spreads on your trades, you only have slippage. So it's pure trader against trader, whereas in order book you have market makers that take a bid ask, that give you a bid ask, and you fill it at the prices that they offer. With a VMM, each trade pushes the price up of the curve on a curve that we've set out, and the trading happens much more organically. So it's like, we call it the most elegant P two P trading solution out there. And we also think it's a lot more capital efficient because every single trade accounts for volume on the platform rather than being locked in an order book. And yeah, that enables all the fees to go back into our platform rather than being given to external market makers.
00:33:03.454 - 00:33:07.542, Speaker A: Cool. I will come find you guys later because I have a million more questions.
00:33:07.638 - 00:33:08.182, Speaker D: Sounds good.
00:33:08.238 - 00:33:09.190, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
00:33:09.342 - 00:33:11.914, Speaker D: Yeah. Anyone wants an NFT, let us know.
00:33:14.244 - 00:33:25.124, Speaker A: Cool. I just wanted to take a second and thank all the presenters today. It's not easy to come up here and present in front of a crowd and a live stream around the world. So thank you. And, yeah, let me know if you have any questions.
