00:00:01.240 - 00:00:24.314, Speaker A: All right, validator community call is starting. Welcome everyone. Thanks for joining today. We've got a couple things to talk about. So first, some network updates. Second, we'll talk about docs and delegation website feedback. So if anyone has thoughts or opinions on the delegation website, I'll mention it again in just a minute.
00:00:24.314 - 00:00:57.262, Speaker A: And finally, the Marinade team is here. Marinade is going to give a talk on a couple items. So first of all, some changes to their validator delegation strategy. Next, the new decentralizer tool that they've been working on. They're going to give a walkthrough and talk about that. And finally, some. I don't actually know what this feature is, but the validator gauge feature that was voted on by their Dao is going to be implemented and we'll be talking about that a little bit as well.
00:00:57.262 - 00:01:02.154, Speaker A: So thank you, Lucio, for joining and talking about everything.
00:01:03.414 - 00:01:04.550, Speaker B: All right, cool.
00:01:04.742 - 00:01:41.324, Speaker A: So network updates, let's start there. First thing to know is that QuIC is still under development, still being tested in testnet. As you all know, it's a pretty complicated change, so patience there for the testing and making sure we get all the bugs out. I know everyone's been patiently awaiting that, so hold tight. And I've been told by the engineering team, no dates, but they're working out the bugs as we speak. The other update is that one 9.12 is recommended now for Mainnet.
00:01:41.324 - 00:02:03.724, Speaker A: Encourage everyone to update to one 9.12 and Mainnet. There's some stability improvements that should help with all your validators there if you. Oh, sorry, wrote that down backwards. 21 little dyslexia there. One 9.21 is now recommended, so please update to that in order to get the stability improvements there.
00:02:04.824 - 00:02:05.672, Speaker B: All right, next.
00:02:05.808 - 00:02:25.794, Speaker C: Yeah, a quick question. I mean, we're dealing, we're looking at a pretty high skip rate at the moment, so I've been waiting for some of the congestion to settle down. What are the nature of the stability improvements and is it considered urgent that we should do it in the face of a high skip rate?
00:02:26.374 - 00:02:49.814, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. The release notes don't give a lot of information, so I'd have to give you. I have to get back to you on that. Yeah, some of the engineering team is away right now on sort of like a group call, so the response may not be immediate, but I think for now you could stay on whatever version you're on until you get the response.
00:02:56.474 - 00:02:57.938, Speaker B: Okay, great.
00:02:58.066 - 00:03:05.894, Speaker A: Yeah, so I owe everyone a response on that. Any other questions about general updates to the validator.
00:03:12.614 - 00:03:13.474, Speaker B: Okay.
00:03:15.934 - 00:04:12.544, Speaker A: All right, next thing. One of the things I've been working on here are some docs, and I'm going to put that in the chat. The idea for these docs is to be a community resource, so if anyone is interested in contributing, adding more. I've been meeting with some of you one on one and getting feedback. But the more feedback the better on things you want to see, things you feel like you missed out on when you read through the main docs and didn't quite cover it well enough, or just something that you do in your day to day operations as a validator that you think other community members could benefit from. I'm happy to either facilitate you doing a pull request to add those features, or if you tell me, kind of like your ideas of what you want to add, I can add it myself as well. So happy to get contributions in form of suggestions or contributions in the form of pull requests to the repo.
00:04:12.544 - 00:05:15.316, Speaker A: It's written in Docusaurus, similar to the validator docs on Docs dot slan.com, so should be pretty straightforward to contribute to, but I can always help out as well. All right, any questions there? All right, again, the links in the chat, please take a look and I'll be reaching out to people as well to get feedback directly if yeah, as needed. Next thing here is the delegation program. So the delegation program is looking for feedback on the website and in general feedback about the delegation program. There is a link posted in the community validator discussion post in validator announcements. So if you have feedback there, please feel free to use that calendly and find some time with us to give us feedback.
00:05:15.316 - 00:05:20.824, Speaker A: I'll put the whole blurb from Ella in the chat as well.
00:05:36.764 - 00:05:39.504, Speaker B: Sorry. Thank you.
00:05:40.684 - 00:05:50.064, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a calendar link there where you can get feedback or schedule an interview for feedback. Any questions on that?
00:05:51.084 - 00:05:52.716, Speaker B: No? All right, cool.
00:05:52.860 - 00:06:00.344, Speaker A: That's all the announcements. I'll turn it over to Lucia with the marinade team for new marinade features and tools.
00:06:01.884 - 00:06:47.066, Speaker D: Thank you very much, Tim. I will make it short. I will love to answer questions better than to extend me extend too much in the explanation. We will be presenting three new things right now. One is a small change in how do we rebalance the stake marinade. From the start up to now, we were, let's say, waiting for waves of stake and unstake in the marinade application in order to adjust the stakeholder of the more than 400 validators we are staking into. So it was a slow process.
00:06:47.066 - 00:07:57.984, Speaker D: The idea was to not move too much stake from one validator to other to provide some stability. But right now the changes in validator performance are moving faster than the waves of stake and unstake in the marinade application. So we are introducing a new instruction in the backend, and it's a new tool for the delegation strategy that is called partial and stake. What we can do now is if there are a lot of validators that are performing really well, but there are no match people staking, we will be able to partial and stake validators that are overstaked. So in the next epoch we will be able to stake on the validators that are performing well. So it means that our speed to reach target, our speed to, let's say stake where the good performance is, will be way more faster. That will be important.
00:07:57.984 - 00:09:00.246, Speaker D: Maybe you see that and it's in uni. If you have any questions, you can ask it in the, in the discord tool to see how it works. Second thing, that's a public school project that we did with a grant from Solana foundation. The situation is the following. We are seeing that there is a lot of soul that either belongs to large whales, belongs to people that are so self validating, or belong to people that for legal and tax reasons cannot stake in marinade and get a liquid token. So what we build is we use all the technology of scoring validators and monitoring validators and balancing stake. But we remove the on chain program, so we create something that is called the decentralizer and the users do not get a liquid token in return.
00:09:00.246 - 00:10:12.094, Speaker D: But the rest of marinade is working in that program, in that tool. So, for example, if you have a big stake account, let's say 1 million, so, and you don't want to have the problem of diversifying it manually. With the decentralizer you delegate, only the rebalance authority would be the stake authority, not the withdrawal authority. So you never lose control of your funds. And with the delegate authority, the marinade boat will do the distribution quite similar of the distribution marinade does between more than 400 validators. I think this is good for people that has those accounts and cannot for legal reasons or tax reasons, use marinade. But is understand the need for decentralization and understand that if we decentralize, we make solar stronger, we make.
00:10:12.094 - 00:11:33.450, Speaker D: So let's say price to rise faster. So we are trying to promote that tool, even if it, even if it's, let's say, compete with marinade itself. So, for example, we don't think that retail will need to use such tools because you need to have a stake account. You don't get the liquid stake and you don't get defiled and anything, but we will try to promote it with people that has a large stake accounts, is long in soul and understands the need for decentralization. This is the decentralizer. And the third item, this is quite important too. Right now Marinette is using this discoverer, this open source program that just automatically measures and tracks validator performance and distributing basis on, on the result of that, there was, there were several comments that sometimes it's not as easy to discover automatically which are the good validators, because some validators maybe are doing a lot of for the community.
00:11:33.450 - 00:13:23.770, Speaker D: Some other validators maybe are just clones or managed by the same entity. So there was a proposal that has now been passed that creates the following 10% of the Mariner stake will no longer be automatically distributed 10% of the Mariner stake will be distributed according to boats, and the boats will be made with and with the NFTs that we are minting that in reality are locked MND inside, have locked MND inside of them. So the idea is that people in the validator community and the Marinade community will be able to at least, let's say, provide more support by voting by decision to certain validators. This will be in place, I guess, within the next month, but we will be, let's say, communicating with everybody before this start. So I think you should know it before anybody else because let's say holding MD will provide you with some way to make, to ensure certain amount of stake. So we hope that that will be helpful in order to keep validators into the system and provide more, let's say, some certainty about expenses and rewards. Okay, please, any question, it was too much, maybe.
00:13:23.770 - 00:13:24.494, Speaker D: But.
00:13:32.474 - 00:13:49.394, Speaker A: There'S a question about a proposal to change, change the cool down period for staking. So when you de stake and move somewhere else, are you aware of that? Zan linked it right now it is.
00:13:49.474 - 00:14:19.932, Speaker D: One, one epoch only. I don't know if I understand the question correctly. Let me check without an epoch. Oh, yes, yes, sorry. A proposal in the Solana discord. Yes, yes. That will make the movements way more faster.
00:14:19.932 - 00:14:57.634, Speaker D: Yes, but we asked Sean about that and that wasn't, let's say, near completion or something that will be deployed soon. Yes. The idea for everyone else is that you have some mistake delegated to one validator and you can move it to a secondary validator without delegating and waiting for the cooldown. That will make all stake pools way more efficient. But also will make, let's say, stake movements more unpredictable.
00:15:04.614 - 00:15:16.558, Speaker A: I'm actually curious myself about the mechanics of voting validators into the new pool. So if, if you, you manually vote, who proposes the validator to be voted on or how does that work?
00:15:16.726 - 00:15:50.572, Speaker D: Yes. Right now we are tracking 1300 validators. We are staking in, I think near 500, 470 something. The last time I checked. What you can do with the voting is, let's say, pick either one of the validators we are staking right now or one of the 1300 we are tracking. For now, the concentrated ones are not allowed to be voted. But any one of these 1300 and vote for them.
00:15:50.572 - 00:16:23.450, Speaker D: Vote for the vote key. You associate your voting power to the vote key. And every epoch we take a snapshot of the vote. And for example, if one validator gets 20% of the vote, it will get 20. It will get 20% of the 10% of marinade stake. Let's say that will be, if marinated stake is 7 billion, that will be seven hundred k. One hundred forty k will go to that validator as long as they get 20% of the vote.
00:16:23.450 - 00:16:47.374, Speaker D: Another nice thing is that you don't need to revote. Every epoch, the vote stays. So if somebody managed to get x amount of vote and there's not more people getting into the system, you will make sure that you will get, let's say, 2% of the total marinated steak, let's say 20 of the ten for several epochs.
00:16:54.674 - 00:16:56.534, Speaker A: Any other questions for Mernad?
00:16:58.074 - 00:17:46.474, Speaker D: One more thing. We are trying to make a calculator. I don't remember. I think coke and cryptos has something, some calculator that we are trying to maybe add to that in order to be able to compute the cost of getting a stake by vote versus the cost of self staking or getting a stake by other means. The idea is to make, let's say, running a validator more predictable and, and to become profitable, easier, let's say, before time, and make it more easy to become profitable and keep adding validators. Cool.
00:17:48.894 - 00:18:24.514, Speaker A: Any other questions? We've still got a little bit of time left. All right, I want to thank Lucio and the marinade team. One other thing I want to say before we go. You know, this space is for all of you. So if anybody has a topic they want to bring up a best practice, something they want to do a presentation on, we've got a pretty clear schedule going forward. So if anybody's passionate about something and wants to talk about it, this is space for you all to do that. Get in touch with me ti Garcia on discord.
00:18:24.514 - 00:18:38.654, Speaker A: Happy to help out and facilitate a call. Or if you just have something that you want to see in this call, get more info on, let me know as well, but, yeah, thank you, everyone, and I'll see you next time.
