00:00:00.480 - 00:00:42.105, Speaker A: Nick, what are you building? So we're building a sister which is a network of community owned small language models where we have data provenance protocols that help us to incentivize people to feed and share their data to domain specific models and in that way monetize their experience knowledge data sets that they have in different domains. Awesome. So who does it help? Developers. So right now we are focused on devrel use case. We have more than 5050 small language models live, so we support different protocols or different web3 teams if they want to optimate developer support between their protocols or teams and developer community. Awesome. How can people try it out? So assister AI, you can try it.
