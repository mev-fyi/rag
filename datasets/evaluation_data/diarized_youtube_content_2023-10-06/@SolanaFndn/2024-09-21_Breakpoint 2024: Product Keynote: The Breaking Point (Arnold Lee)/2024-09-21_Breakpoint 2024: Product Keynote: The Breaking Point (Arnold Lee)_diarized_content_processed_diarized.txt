00:00:05.640 - 00:00:23.297, Speaker A: Gmgm. So I'm Arnold, co founder of Sphere. We got our start on Solana way back doing crypto payments. And what I'd like to talk to you about today are some of the lessons that we've learned building a payments company.
00:00:23.441 - 00:00:25.449, Speaker B: You usually ask people what they're bullish.
00:00:25.497 - 00:00:37.365, Speaker A: On for real world use cases within crypto and they'll tell you payments. And that was me too until I decided to build a crypto payments company. Then you start to run into some.
00:00:37.405 - 00:00:40.309, Speaker B: Obstacles which I like to call great.
00:00:40.357 - 00:00:56.355, Speaker A: Filters that show you why getting money in and out of chains today is extremely hard. Today we work with a lot of amazing Solana companies, Helios, Helium Squads, Latitude List goes on.
00:00:57.575 - 00:00:59.903, Speaker B: But over the last year a lot.
00:00:59.919 - 00:01:19.075, Speaker A: Of our focus has been in cross border payments, especially in emerging markets where through happenstance the DNA of the team really concentrated. When crypto is down bad, we do orchestration. We're essentially a money transmission aggregator and really get into the low level of bank messaging.
00:01:20.465 - 00:01:21.873, Speaker B: Over the last few years a lot.
00:01:21.889 - 00:02:04.515, Speaker A: Of my conversations have been with bankers, regulators, compliance officers, risk officers, and trying to convince them to more natively support the amazing things that can be built on top of open loop permissionless chains. So you know, what are some common, I suppose, obstacles that we see when interfacing with these types of counterparties? I like to call this a suffering from success because as these ecosystems have grown so much in size and you know, now all of you are here, I remember a couple of break points ago, it was a much smaller crowd, reputational risk becomes quite important because the.
00:02:04.555 - 00:02:06.635, Speaker B: Quiet part out loud is that it's.
00:02:06.675 - 00:02:36.283, Speaker A: Very hard to move a lot of money recurringly in and out of crypto because of the open risk vectors that exist within open loop permissionless chains. And why is that? Well, you know, it turns out if anyone in the world who has a computer and an Internet connection can kind of do what they want on chain. There's good stuff and there's also bad stuff. And you know, it's a separate question of philosophy, of what you define as good or bad.
00:02:36.419 - 00:02:38.261, Speaker B: What I will say is that there.
00:02:38.293 - 00:03:17.947, Speaker A: Is a category of activity that is considered higher risk because you don't know who you're interacting with, who is building your block, who is confirming your transactions, who are you paying fees to, who is interacting with your account and sending you coins. When it comes to the Bank Secrecy act, this law that has driven money laundering and counter terrorist financing principles across many different countries, this notion of risk starts to really matter. So you know, people make up trilemmas without formal proof. So I'll give you another one which is between regulators, blockchains and banks.
00:03:18.051 - 00:03:19.611, Speaker B: It's really hard to get all three.
00:03:19.643 - 00:03:35.209, Speaker A: Of these counterparties to give full approval on allowing you to move a ton of money in and out of crypto. You've probably wondered why isn't there a way for me to just use Apple Pay and get a lot of money into crypto? Why do I have to kyc so much?
00:03:35.377 - 00:03:37.321, Speaker B: Why are the authorities so low?
00:03:37.473 - 00:04:07.655, Speaker A: And it's convincing. And finding the overlap between these three, the blockchains that want to with banks and the regulators that oversee bank activity. Here are a couple of examples that you probably know of. You could have a CDBC appease regulators and banks. There are centralized exchanges like previously FTX that found the middle ground between regulators and blockchains and older chains like Ripple that find the middle ground between blockchains and banks.
00:04:10.115 - 00:04:12.043, Speaker B: Despite that, it's still really hard to.
00:04:12.059 - 00:04:52.295, Speaker A: Move money in and out of crypto. Satoshi's original vision was a peer to peer payment system. And yet 8 billion people, how many use crypto today? I'm going to introduce a couple of key things that we think are part of the solution. Naturally you want a very high performance virtual machine. There's a ton of TPS in the world. You want fixed and nominal gas fees. Something that people don't really talk about is that regulated institutions that have to report their financial activity each year are hesitant to hold coins that could go up and down in value and where source of funding is unclear and the last is built in privacy and compliance.
00:04:52.295 - 00:04:57.315, Speaker A: This is the way that you make this technology truly interoperable with the fiat.
00:04:57.435 - 00:04:58.615, Speaker B: With the real world.
00:05:00.205 - 00:05:21.585, Speaker A: One analogy that we like to use in order to describe the system is a decentralized wise where you have local experts coming in from all different jurisdictions, regulated by different agencies in the world and you give them a credibly neutral platform in order to find each other. That's one of the biggest headaches as a fintech trying to service things that are happening on blockchains.
00:05:22.445 - 00:05:24.385, Speaker B: So this is a QR code for.
00:05:24.765 - 00:05:42.767, Speaker A: What we'd like to publicly introduce today more formally, which is Sphere Net. If you're a fintech in the crowd, you might have heard me talk about it. It's a way for us to bring us all together leveraging the most performant distributed system that humanity has ever created, Solana virtual machine in order to make.
00:05:42.791 - 00:05:44.559, Speaker B: It so that the users, the app.
00:05:44.607 - 00:06:13.507, Speaker A: Builders who are trying to innovate in open finance, consumer apps, gaming and so forth now have a clear channel with the banks and the infrastructure that is required to really make this technology mainstream. If you're interested in contributing as a regulated institution, as a fintech, we'd love to talk. Some of the greatest challenges that we've seen can come down to language, culture and in convincing foreign entities to really.
00:06:13.531 - 00:06:15.675, Speaker B: Give you the best service possible without.
00:06:15.715 - 00:06:22.579, Speaker A: It taking a lot of time and money. So thanks for listening and I hope that some of this was mildly interesting to.
