00:00:04.880 - 00:00:06.758, Speaker A: Albert, welcome to Validated.
00:00:06.926 - 00:00:08.622, Speaker B: Hey, Austin, good to be here.
00:00:08.798 - 00:00:45.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to talk about a lot of things today, but I want to start out with Gamefi and blockchain gaming as a category. This has been something people have been talking about for a very long time. I think this is one of the sort of, it's not quite the OG use case that payments is, but it's up there as sort of, we need to decentralize games blockchain can really play a huge part in. This thesis has been true for a very long time, but it's felt like blockchain gaming is going to come next year for probably the last four years. So where actually are we right now in the journey of Gamefi and blockchain gaming?
00:00:45.854 - 00:00:49.270, Speaker C: I think we're getting really close for.
00:00:49.302 - 00:00:53.942, Speaker B: Us over here at Genopets. We've been building since 2021, and there.
00:00:53.998 - 00:01:08.174, Speaker C: Is a lot of other projects that built alongside us and with, um, different philosophies on what web3 means for gaming. There are people who believe that web3 should be completely on chain.
00:01:08.214 - 00:01:10.406, Speaker B: So these are, I think, games that.
00:01:10.430 - 00:01:21.302, Speaker C: Are called fully on chain worlds. Those have their own place and those skew towards the audience that are web3 native.
00:01:21.478 - 00:01:23.926, Speaker B: For us at Genopets, we believe that.
00:01:23.950 - 00:01:25.454, Speaker C: The main use case of web3.
00:01:25.494 - 00:01:28.038, Speaker B: Game and gaming and consumer applications in.
00:01:28.046 - 00:01:33.280, Speaker C: General general, is the flywheel effect when the users become both the demand side.
00:01:33.312 - 00:01:34.944, Speaker B: And the supply side of the business.
00:01:35.104 - 00:01:54.844, Speaker C: So in the case of games, we think that it means instead of buying these game items in game assets from game publishers, players are buying them from other players and players are creating it themselves. And that's how you create a flywheel effect. Because prior to web3, most games.
00:01:55.374 - 00:02:00.914, Speaker B: I mean, all games in general, have the model where the publishers create items.
00:02:01.574 - 00:02:05.630, Speaker C: Create endgame assets and content, and then.
00:02:05.662 - 00:02:08.430, Speaker B: Consumers do one thing and they just.
00:02:08.462 - 00:02:11.694, Speaker C: Consume it and buy. And I think that's great.
00:02:11.734 - 00:02:14.502, Speaker B: And it works well for a lot.
00:02:14.518 - 00:02:19.350, Speaker C: Of the games out there. But for web3 gaming, we're turning.
00:02:19.382 - 00:02:21.714, Speaker B: This around and we call this the player own economy.
00:02:23.094 - 00:03:24.624, Speaker A: Yeah. So I want to get into a lot of how this works because I think we all know, I mean, one of my early experiences with online games was buying World of Warcraft Gold from eBay, which is a very funny experience, right. That's 20 years ago, effectively, you saw games like Eve Online be able to create very long tail, like almost decade long game experiences because there was a company printing money in the middle there, getting revenue the second life. I'm not sure if it's still around today, but it had quite a run because it had a hybrid model where some of the revenue went to the people in the game and some of the revenue actually went to the game developer side of things. So in this world of players transacting with players directly, how do you deal with the, quite frankly, logistics and long term economics that games still need servers and game developers still need to exist to keep the games going?
00:03:25.604 - 00:03:32.788, Speaker C: Yeah, so we don't, I think that's the dichotomy. There is basically what I mentioned before.
00:03:32.956 - 00:03:39.468, Speaker B: Are we talking about games that are fully on chain or games that use the, use web3 as a conduit.
00:03:39.516 - 00:03:41.508, Speaker C: For the in game economy and for.
00:03:41.556 - 00:03:45.232, Speaker B: Us, we believe in the latter. So I will speak to the latter.
00:03:45.388 - 00:03:48.616, Speaker C: And I don't think for genopets or.
00:03:48.640 - 00:03:52.880, Speaker B: Other games in our category, we believe that the game should be fully decentralized.
00:03:52.992 - 00:03:54.552, Speaker C: I think there's still a role for.
00:03:54.568 - 00:04:03.088, Speaker B: The publisher to manage servers to create the mobile game or the desktop game.
00:04:03.216 - 00:04:16.776, Speaker C: For people to consume. Now the difference is with web3 economy, there are a few things you can do. Uh, you could have token governance for the content and then as part of.
00:04:16.800 - 00:04:19.128, Speaker B: That governance you can decide on the.
00:04:19.176 - 00:04:22.672, Speaker C: The cost for creating these items and.
00:04:22.768 - 00:04:31.384, Speaker B: The cost for uh, the burning these items or, or the use cases for these items. So that's what we actually have going and will have in the future.
00:04:31.544 - 00:04:34.824, Speaker C: Uh, most of the settings for economic.
00:04:34.944 - 00:04:37.192, Speaker B: Sinks for our items and the crafting.
00:04:37.248 - 00:04:47.642, Speaker C: Recipes to create these items are all on chain and upgradable and can be governed. So, yeah, so in that case, I.
00:04:47.658 - 00:04:50.362, Speaker B: Think to answer your question, to make.
00:04:50.378 - 00:04:58.242, Speaker C: It balanced, we want a very specific part of the game, which is the economic side of the game, to be.
00:04:58.418 - 00:05:00.338, Speaker B: Decentralized and governed by the players.
00:05:00.426 - 00:05:03.298, Speaker C: But everything else we keep it as part of the publishers.
00:05:03.426 - 00:05:04.066, Speaker B: Nice.
00:05:04.210 - 00:05:19.334, Speaker A: So I want to get into a bunch of how you guys are tying into Solana, Defi and all those sorts of things. But before we get into that, just give me an overview of Genopets. What is the sort of gameplay style, how do folks get involved, and how long has the game actually been live?
00:05:19.754 - 00:05:20.130, Speaker C: Cool.
00:05:20.162 - 00:05:34.242, Speaker B: Yeah. So Genopets is a gamified habit app that rewards players for living a healthy lifestyle. So you raise a digital pet powered by steps that you take every day. So think Tamagotchi or Pokemon go. You take care of it by taking care of yourself.
00:05:34.338 - 00:05:38.734, Speaker C: You customize it, and then you use your pet to compete against other players.
00:05:39.034 - 00:05:48.706, Speaker B: Now you can level up and upgrade your pet with various items. And in game assets such as augments, boosts, cosmetic skins. Like I was mentioning before, these items.
00:05:48.730 - 00:05:53.402, Speaker C: Are crafted by other players in the web3 side of the game. And the web3 side of a.
00:05:53.418 - 00:06:02.278, Speaker B: Game is an optional expansion pack, so to speak. So we created economy this way so that the mobile players are the buy side.
00:06:02.426 - 00:06:13.950, Speaker C: And the mobile app experience is mostly a web3 invisible experience. And then there's a web3 crafting side that's on our website where you can play to earn and you can.
00:06:13.982 - 00:06:16.206, Speaker B: Craft and mint assets to sell to the wider player base.
00:06:16.230 - 00:06:17.478, Speaker C: And that part is optional.
00:06:17.646 - 00:06:45.814, Speaker A: I want to get into how that works. I think your instinct there of like we have to abstract away a lot of the web3 side to get consumers engaged is super, super. Right, right. I think that's what we've seen step in. Had a similar approach, which was quite successful. We've even seen a lot of folks like Baxis having a very similar approach where they're doing something very different with whiskey as an asset class. But the web3 part of it is sort of abstracted away.
00:06:45.814 - 00:07:04.174, Speaker A: So talk to me a little bit about that interface between the folks who know this is built on blockchain. They know how it works. They're storing their digital assets in actual blockchain wallets. And the folks that are downloading it thinking it's sort of any other classic web two mobile game experience.
00:07:05.114 - 00:07:05.538, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:05.586 - 00:07:08.282, Speaker B: So we've made our mobile app, like.
00:07:08.298 - 00:07:10.202, Speaker C: You said, completely web3 invisible.
00:07:10.258 - 00:07:12.050, Speaker B: It could pass as any other app.
00:07:12.202 - 00:07:13.762, Speaker C: The only difference is when you go.
00:07:13.778 - 00:07:15.010, Speaker B: Into the shop section of the mobile.
00:07:15.042 - 00:07:21.800, Speaker C: App, you're buying from other players, not from the publisher. So the idea is that most consumers of mobile apps don't need to or.
00:07:21.832 - 00:07:25.256, Speaker B: Even want to understand the complexity of setting up their wallet, making transactions on.
00:07:25.280 - 00:07:27.920, Speaker C: Chain, et cetera, until they're absolutely ready.
00:07:28.032 - 00:07:30.200, Speaker B: Yeah. So the experience feels like this.
00:07:30.272 - 00:07:36.760, Speaker C: And the mobile app, there's no crypto. You go in, uh, when it's your first time, you summon your genome pet.
00:07:36.792 - 00:07:40.440, Speaker B: You start taking care of it, um, when you want to start upgrading your.
00:07:40.472 - 00:07:49.212, Speaker C: Pet or buying food for your pet, we have an in game currency called qubits, which is basically a wrap version of USDC.
00:07:49.328 - 00:07:50.804, Speaker B: But the players don't really know that.
00:07:50.884 - 00:07:57.996, Speaker C: They. It just looks and feels like any in game currency. For other web two games now, and.
00:07:58.140 - 00:08:02.612, Speaker B: Similar to other web two games, this is also purchased via regular in app purchase.
00:08:02.708 - 00:08:04.868, Speaker C: So for those that don't play games.
00:08:04.916 - 00:08:09.220, Speaker B: On mobile, think Apple Pay. So you just double click your lock.
00:08:09.252 - 00:08:11.140, Speaker C: Button and then you can pay via.
00:08:11.292 - 00:08:13.372, Speaker B: Your linked credit card.
00:08:13.508 - 00:08:19.644, Speaker C: So after you do that you get these, these in game currency that we call qubits.
00:08:19.944 - 00:08:22.484, Speaker B: Now with the qubits we've partnered with.
00:08:22.784 - 00:08:25.216, Speaker C: Solana Project called Coin Flow to make.
00:08:25.240 - 00:08:27.096, Speaker B: It so that every purchase of qubits.
00:08:27.160 - 00:08:38.296, Speaker C: Is mapped with a corresponding USDC wrapping on chain. So these qubits could be used to purchase on chain assets in the background for the player. On the other side there's a web.
00:08:38.320 - 00:08:39.016, Speaker B: Three part of the game.
00:08:39.040 - 00:08:40.995, Speaker C: So on our website we built an.
00:08:41.019 - 00:08:57.851, Speaker B: On chain marketplace for endgame assets. Uh, we built it on Phoenix, Phoenix decks. So that's something I would talk about. Love Phoenix. When they first launched um, last year I was looking to uh, at it for a while. But anyway, this marketplace functions just like any NFT marketplace. You buy and sell any in game assets.
00:08:57.907 - 00:09:09.266, Speaker C: You connect your wallet, you list, you buy. Done. Very, very simple for web3 natives. On the, on the mobile app these listings become viewable but the prices appear as qubits.
00:09:09.370 - 00:09:11.170, Speaker B: So when a player purchases the item.
00:09:11.202 - 00:09:23.574, Speaker C: In the game it feels like purchasing an in game asset sold by the publisher. Then the background that the ask on the order book is actually taken on chain and the marketplace fees and everything.
00:09:23.994 - 00:09:26.162, Speaker B: Are swapped and then swapped to our.
00:09:26.218 - 00:09:28.106, Speaker C: Native token gene as a buyback.
00:09:28.250 - 00:09:31.906, Speaker B: And this is all done in one atomic transaction to make it feel as.
00:09:31.930 - 00:09:33.974, Speaker C: Close to a web two experience as possible.
00:09:34.414 - 00:09:42.754, Speaker A: So how much of this is intentional design choice and how much of this is dictated by the duopoly of App Stores?
00:09:43.934 - 00:09:45.430, Speaker C: That's a really, really good question.
00:09:45.502 - 00:09:59.262, Speaker B: I think it's a little bit of both. But the duopoly of the App Stores plays a significant role in us making qubits a in app purchased currency. I think without the App Store or.
00:09:59.278 - 00:10:02.254, Speaker C: Google Play stored rules, what we would.
00:10:02.294 - 00:10:04.014, Speaker B: We would probably still go this way.
00:10:04.094 - 00:10:06.342, Speaker C: But the difference is instead of in.
00:10:06.358 - 00:10:07.926, Speaker B: App purchase, we probably would just ask.
00:10:07.950 - 00:10:10.670, Speaker C: Him for their credit card or use.
00:10:10.702 - 00:10:12.534, Speaker B: Moonpay or some kind of on ramp for it.
00:10:12.574 - 00:10:16.074, Speaker A: Right, because there's effectively a 30% tax on the qubits.
00:10:16.774 - 00:10:17.270, Speaker C: Correct?
00:10:17.342 - 00:10:24.334, Speaker B: So the qubits that you get. Yeah, that is correct. And it's really great that you mentioned it right away.
00:10:24.454 - 00:10:28.006, Speaker C: So the qubit serves as a interface.
00:10:28.070 - 00:10:30.532, Speaker B: In which you kind of abstract that away, right?
00:10:30.678 - 00:10:33.672, Speaker C: The qubits are not one to one, um, to USD.
00:10:33.768 - 00:10:35.328, Speaker B: So when you're buying I think $2.
00:10:35.376 - 00:10:39.336, Speaker C: Of uh, qubits, you're getting uh, you're getting 4000 qubits.
00:10:39.360 - 00:10:41.784, Speaker B: And we have our internal way of mapping that to USDC.
00:10:41.904 - 00:10:44.320, Speaker C: But essentially when you do that uh.
00:10:44.352 - 00:10:45.696, Speaker B: You'Re getting taxed by the App Store.
00:10:45.720 - 00:10:48.288, Speaker C: Of 30% and that's, that's taking out.
00:10:48.376 - 00:10:54.124, Speaker A: And so the qubit component, there's nothing blockchain about that. That's just any old in game point system.
00:10:54.464 - 00:10:58.608, Speaker C: Correct? It's um, yes and no.
00:10:58.656 - 00:10:59.992, Speaker B: So like, to the.
00:11:00.128 - 00:11:07.464, Speaker C: As part of the mobile experience, it just like points. But in the backend, we actually use coinflow to create these credits on chain.
00:11:07.504 - 00:11:12.408, Speaker B: So every time it happens, we wrap USDC. Okay. We wrap USDC in a custom account.
00:11:12.536 - 00:11:15.840, Speaker C: That we can then use to compose transactions later.
00:11:16.032 - 00:11:47.264, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's really interesting that you guys are actually. Because the way I sort of assume, I think most people might assume this works is I buy qubits with my credit card, Apple takes their 30% cut. And then when I take these qubits and go buy something that's actually coming on chain from Phoenix or another Defi order system, you're basically filling at that point from cash reserves. But you guys actually go ahead and secure USDC on chain to basically make that one atomic transaction.
00:11:47.964 - 00:12:06.546, Speaker B: Yeah, so we made that decision. You could absolutely do that as well, basically serving as a centralized exchange. In a way. The way we were thinking about it is that we want as little of that complexity as possible. And the closer you can get to.
00:12:06.610 - 00:12:13.890, Speaker C: A non custodial experience, the better for both development purposes and just for user experience purposes.
00:12:14.002 - 00:12:16.362, Speaker B: We call this approach the semi custodial.
00:12:16.418 - 00:12:23.574, Speaker C: Approach because we're doing things for their wallet, using their wallet, but we're not actually, we don't actually own the wallet.
00:12:23.614 - 00:12:26.022, Speaker B: And it's not, the transactions aren't taking.
00:12:26.078 - 00:12:44.012, Speaker C: Place in a centralized ledger. It is actually just being done on chain so we don't have to reconcile that and that, you know, and after what FTX happens, we happened, we, we really think that's the way to do things. As if you can make that happen.
00:12:44.148 - 00:13:18.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I kind of love this as an example of how you can build things on blockchain that are actually more efficient than if you had to do sort of the web two counterpart. Because if you guys could be running a giant peer to peer asset trading system that used these qubits and credits and actually had no blockchain involved, but there would just be a lot of custody risk for you as a company at that point. And it's pretty cool that you guys have been able to drive away that people can still pay with in game purchases through the App Store. But, you know, fundamentally what they're dealing with is something that is backed up by a blockchain.
00:13:18.422 - 00:13:20.914, Speaker C: Yeah, we really think that's important.
00:13:21.574 - 00:13:26.030, Speaker B: I've been in this space since 2017, and for the longest time, we're talking.
00:13:26.062 - 00:13:28.102, Speaker C: About how do you make it, how.
00:13:28.118 - 00:13:32.846, Speaker B: Do you make the user experience friendly for web two players? Because having to buy tokens and having.
00:13:32.870 - 00:13:35.046, Speaker C: To set up a wallet is a.
00:13:35.070 - 00:13:37.872, Speaker B: Lot of, there's a lot of barrier, um, to entry.
00:13:37.968 - 00:13:40.504, Speaker C: So you to, to get that through.
00:13:40.544 - 00:13:46.564, Speaker B: You have to dangle, like, the earning side of things in front of them. So you have the incentive to actually go through all of that.
00:13:46.984 - 00:13:52.456, Speaker C: But our idea is that there's a huge amount of other users, potential users.
00:13:52.480 - 00:13:59.440, Speaker B: That you can on board into web3, but they're not ready from the get go. So this is kind of like a Trojan horse for web3. You get it, get them into a.
00:13:59.472 - 00:14:01.848, Speaker C: Game that seems familiar, but then, you.
00:14:01.856 - 00:14:04.720, Speaker B: Know, it's semi custodial. And, and if they want to and.
00:14:04.752 - 00:14:09.598, Speaker C: Are interested in self custody, there's an option for it. So I want to talk a little.
00:14:09.646 - 00:14:18.554, Speaker A: Bit about the on chain defi side of things. You guys are using Phoenix primarily, but are you tying into other pieces of Solana defi as well?
00:14:18.974 - 00:14:24.086, Speaker B: Yeah, we use orca as well for just Amm swaps for buyback of the.
00:14:24.110 - 00:14:31.610, Speaker C: Gene token with marketplace fees. So these are the two main protocols that we compose right now.
00:14:31.742 - 00:14:32.362, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:32.498 - 00:14:39.894, Speaker A: So what was the decision to pick Phoenix? Phoenix is built a little bit different than a lot of the other dexs and order books on Solana.
00:14:40.474 - 00:14:44.414, Speaker C: Yeah. So this is a great story because.
00:14:45.994 - 00:14:53.818, Speaker B: To start, I have to talk about how our in game assets are represented. So we use semifungible tokens, sfts for our in game assets.
00:14:53.946 - 00:14:59.260, Speaker C: These are slightly different from nfTs, non fungible tokens, in that, uh, there are.
00:14:59.332 - 00:15:01.484, Speaker B: Many of the same one. And we use this for in game.
00:15:01.524 - 00:15:04.700, Speaker C: Assets because, uh, in the gaming world.
00:15:04.732 - 00:15:05.796, Speaker B: There are a lot of items that.
00:15:05.820 - 00:15:09.420, Speaker C: Are indistinguishable from other versions of itself self.
00:15:09.492 - 00:15:13.116, Speaker B: Right. For example, if you have a golden ticket, then every other golden ticket is.
00:15:13.140 - 00:15:17.748, Speaker C: Actually the same, aka fungible, with, uh, with itself.
00:15:17.796 - 00:15:20.388, Speaker B: So there's really no need to create.
00:15:20.556 - 00:15:23.412, Speaker C: A massive amount of nfts if they.
00:15:23.428 - 00:15:24.460, Speaker B: All represent the same thing.
00:15:24.492 - 00:15:25.302, Speaker C: And it makes.
00:15:25.428 - 00:15:27.226, Speaker B: Makes a lot easier to compose.
00:15:27.370 - 00:15:30.994, Speaker C: In DeFi, this is actually also standard.
00:15:31.074 - 00:15:33.242, Speaker B: It's also called fungible asset.
00:15:33.378 - 00:15:35.298, Speaker C: It's a standard set by one of.
00:15:35.306 - 00:15:37.450, Speaker B: The standards set by Metaplex and also.
00:15:37.562 - 00:15:46.210, Speaker C: The digital assets API. The Das API. Yeah, because we've made the early decision.
00:15:46.282 - 00:15:48.890, Speaker B: To represent our in game assets as.
00:15:48.922 - 00:15:57.044, Speaker C: Semifungible tokens we had very limited options for creating the marketplace. We couldn't use a regular NFT marketplace.
00:15:57.464 - 00:15:59.688, Speaker B: And back in 2021, when we started.
00:15:59.816 - 00:16:02.464, Speaker C: Serum was the only real option.
00:16:02.584 - 00:16:05.712, Speaker B: And you had other projects such as Star Atlas that just built their entire.
00:16:05.768 - 00:16:26.196, Speaker C: In game asset marketplace on serum. And around middle of 2022, we partnered with Magic Eden and Bodfeeda to create Serum V four. That's a version of Sarin that takes into account creators, royalty. And even today, if you go on.
00:16:26.220 - 00:16:27.964, Speaker B: Magic Eden and go to their semifungible.
00:16:28.004 - 00:16:34.012, Speaker C: Token section, that composes CRM. V four.
00:16:34.108 - 00:16:35.304, Speaker B: Sorry, v four.
00:16:35.684 - 00:16:39.220, Speaker C: Now, I actually met the founders of.
00:16:39.292 - 00:16:43.396, Speaker B: Phoenix at Breakpoint 2022. And I remember the first thing I.
00:16:43.420 - 00:16:48.676, Speaker C: Asked was, what makes Phoenix different from serum? Yeah.
00:16:48.740 - 00:16:53.300, Speaker B: And the number one thing is, it's crankless. Now, for most people, that might not.
00:16:53.332 - 00:16:57.876, Speaker C: Mean a lot, right? But for us, it's huge, because in.
00:16:57.900 - 00:16:59.700, Speaker B: Order to get as close to web.
00:16:59.732 - 00:17:14.836, Speaker C: Two experience as possible, you need to make things, make transactions as atomic as possible. And also, if you're grabbing all these sources of accounts and data and composing with all these different DeFi protocols, you.
00:17:14.860 - 00:17:17.620, Speaker B: Need, you need, you need the transaction.
00:17:17.652 - 00:17:19.924, Speaker C: To be atomic and compose composable.
00:17:19.964 - 00:17:27.084, Speaker B: So the term that we've heard people use for a while now is atomic composability. The term is thrown around a lot.
00:17:27.124 - 00:17:37.676, Speaker C: But it actually has huge user experience implications for consumer apps and gaming. In serum, you had to crank it. So there was no way to know.
00:17:37.700 - 00:17:41.038, Speaker B: Whether your transaction, what price your purchase.
00:17:41.166 - 00:17:46.046, Speaker C: Settle that until the crank passes. And that's very different from a web two experience.
00:17:46.110 - 00:17:48.326, Speaker B: So basically, you transit, you send a.
00:17:48.350 - 00:17:50.318, Speaker C: Transaction, and then you kind of wait.
00:17:50.406 - 00:17:57.830, Speaker B: Maybe it's, it doesn't take that long, but from our experience, it takes about like five to 10 seconds before you know, oh, okay. Yeah, so that's, that's how it settled.
00:17:57.982 - 00:18:02.102, Speaker C: So Phoenix, really, there's a lot of.
00:18:02.118 - 00:18:05.190, Speaker B: Good things about it, but this is the number one reason we chose Phoenix.
00:18:05.302 - 00:18:12.942, Speaker C: Because with it being crankless, you can actually finish an atomic purchase instruction and.
00:18:12.958 - 00:18:15.878, Speaker B: Then add other things, other instructions within.
00:18:15.926 - 00:18:20.118, Speaker C: It, and that whole thing becomes one atomic transaction leading to a really, really.
00:18:20.166 - 00:18:23.294, Speaker B: Good web two, like, user experience. Yeah.
00:18:23.334 - 00:18:52.594, Speaker A: So talk to me a little bit about transaction formation and sort of this process here, because one of the things with sauna transactions is they're cu. Limited in a way that on slower networks like Ethereum, a transaction can spiral out and do lots of things. Now, that transaction might cost $20 to execute, and it might, you know, you might have to wait a minute or two to know, it's actually confirmed. But what sort of design decisions did you have to make to build something like this on Solana?
00:18:53.934 - 00:19:01.694, Speaker B: It's interesting that you mentioned compute budget, because we've been building since 2021, and we were growing while Solana was growing as well. Yeah.
00:19:01.734 - 00:19:16.154, Speaker C: Solana in the past two years have made so many improvements that facilitated the ability to do atomic transactions. So in early 2022, the main bottleneck was compute budget, because at that time.
00:19:16.194 - 00:19:17.426, Speaker B: There was no compute budget.
00:19:17.490 - 00:19:18.674, Speaker C: Increased instruction.
00:19:18.834 - 00:19:23.054, Speaker B: It was feature gated for until, like, I think, middle of 2022.
00:19:23.954 - 00:19:26.214, Speaker C: So we couldn't do it back then.
00:19:26.594 - 00:19:28.934, Speaker B: And then after that was passed, then.
00:19:29.474 - 00:19:33.422, Speaker C: You can start, uh, creating transactions with.
00:19:33.438 - 00:19:34.342, Speaker B: A compute budget increase.
00:19:34.398 - 00:19:40.734, Speaker C: So you can do transactions with huge. That uses huge compute. But then you have another, uh, bottleneck.
00:19:40.774 - 00:19:46.166, Speaker B: Which is the transaction size. Right. The transaction size. Uh, because of the MTU limit, and.
00:19:46.190 - 00:19:52.910, Speaker C: Everything is relatively smallest, and it's. And I think something like 40 accounts.
00:19:52.942 - 00:19:54.486, Speaker B: Or 50, I forget the exact number.
00:19:54.510 - 00:19:56.142, Speaker C: But you had a limit of the.
00:19:56.158 - 00:19:57.238, Speaker B: Number of accounts that you can pass.
00:19:57.286 - 00:19:59.918, Speaker C: In, which is a direct bottleneck for.
00:20:00.046 - 00:20:02.182, Speaker B: Something that we wanted to do. Because if you wanted to do an.
00:20:02.198 - 00:20:04.718, Speaker C: Orca swap and a Phoenix Dex swap.
00:20:04.846 - 00:20:06.766, Speaker B: And unwrapping the USDC on a coin.
00:20:06.790 - 00:20:12.118, Speaker C: Flow program all in the same transaction, we need about 50 to 60 accounts.
00:20:12.246 - 00:20:13.790, Speaker B: And that's just not possible. Right.
00:20:13.862 - 00:20:17.662, Speaker C: So, later on, as you probably know where I'm going with this version, zero.
00:20:17.718 - 00:20:20.838, Speaker B: Transactions came along, and you're now able.
00:20:20.886 - 00:20:24.650, Speaker C: To use lookup tables to, uh, to.
00:20:24.762 - 00:20:26.458, Speaker B: Decrease the size 32 fold.
00:20:26.506 - 00:20:28.354, Speaker C: Right. So any account that's.
00:20:28.514 - 00:20:32.914, Speaker B: That's, uh, that's on your lookup table now takes one byte instead of 32 bytes.
00:20:33.034 - 00:20:34.114, Speaker C: That was huge.
00:20:34.274 - 00:20:35.746, Speaker B: As soon as that happened, that's when.
00:20:35.770 - 00:20:38.250, Speaker C: We realized, okay, this is possible, uh.
00:20:38.282 - 00:20:40.722, Speaker B: To create, like, a one transaction that.
00:20:40.818 - 00:20:48.538, Speaker C: Uses a swap on orca, a swap on, uh, phoenix, and an unwrapping on. On coin flow.
00:20:48.626 - 00:20:52.074, Speaker B: So that was really exciting for us, and that was the moment we realized.
00:20:52.374 - 00:20:56.034, Speaker C: You know, it's only possible on Solana. Love it.
00:20:56.374 - 00:21:02.234, Speaker A: Uh, so what is not possible today on Solana that you wish was?
00:21:03.094 - 00:21:05.874, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a really good question. I don't think.
00:21:06.254 - 00:21:08.942, Speaker B: I think there's a lot, lot of room for improvement.
00:21:09.038 - 00:21:11.366, Speaker C: I wouldn't say it's impossible, but the.
00:21:11.390 - 00:21:13.318, Speaker B: Biggest pain point right now is how.
00:21:13.406 - 00:21:20.842, Speaker C: Um, how composability works. When we compose, when you want to.
00:21:20.938 - 00:21:23.514, Speaker B: Interact with another program right now, you.
00:21:23.554 - 00:21:32.946, Speaker C: Basically need their SDK. You can't just go take their IDL and just do things with it, because.
00:21:33.090 - 00:21:37.378, Speaker B: Account resolution is really a problem. You don't know what these accounts are.
00:21:37.466 - 00:21:42.582, Speaker C: The SDKs usually will help you figure that out or their documentation. So that's different.
00:21:42.678 - 00:21:45.062, Speaker B: Cause for me, I also built on.
00:21:45.198 - 00:21:46.190, Speaker C: EVM back in the day.
00:21:46.222 - 00:21:51.794, Speaker B: That's not something you need to even think about. So I think that's a huge pain point.
00:21:52.254 - 00:21:57.310, Speaker C: And also serialization of the data right.
00:21:57.342 - 00:22:10.274, Speaker B: Now with anchor, it's a lot better. Most of the protocols just use borscht, but then when it comes to Phoenix decks, Phoenix Dex is built with native.
00:22:10.314 - 00:22:13.322, Speaker C: Solana, so then it's not hugely different.
00:22:13.378 - 00:22:15.906, Speaker B: But then we have to actually, when.
00:22:15.930 - 00:22:17.346, Speaker C: We were composing it, we had to.
00:22:17.370 - 00:22:27.122, Speaker B: Actually study how the data was serialized and deserialized and composed it that way. This is really interesting, because since Solana has been making such big waves and.
00:22:27.298 - 00:22:28.898, Speaker C: The web3 world, there are a.
00:22:28.906 - 00:22:40.004, Speaker B: Lot of projects coming over. And I've been, I'm advising a few friends and other partner projects to come on. And the number one thing they ask about is how do, how do you do CPI?
00:22:40.344 - 00:22:43.872, Speaker C: And, and, you know, it's kind of.
00:22:43.888 - 00:22:55.560, Speaker B: Those things that when you've been in the ecosystem for so long, this is like something that you're just used to. But then when people point out how crazy it is that you have to actually go and read the core, read the code of the protocol you're trying to compose.
00:22:55.672 - 00:22:56.128, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:56.216 - 00:22:58.016, Speaker B: And fully internalize it before you can.
00:22:58.040 - 00:23:00.192, Speaker C: Start using it, that's kind of crazy.
00:23:00.288 - 00:23:08.748, Speaker B: And I know, like I said, all of these things, and it's probably obvious what the solution is, which is runtime V two. So I'm excited about that too.
00:23:08.916 - 00:23:11.748, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:23:11.876 - 00:23:46.744, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it's really interesting to sort of like, hear you talk about this, because, I mean, one of the reasons people love anchor is it solves or it makes some of these problems easier. But the downside of anchor is the performance hits. It's not as performant as building something natively in Solana code. So runtime V two is absolutely one of those things that will sort of work towards making this better. Um, but it's very, it's also interesting to see sort of how much of this you guys have still been able to, to build, even with, um, some of these challenges in, in cross program invocations.
00:23:47.644 - 00:23:49.676, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the main difference is.
00:23:49.700 - 00:23:53.028, Speaker C: That I, the barrier, uh, for, for.
00:23:53.116 - 00:23:54.580, Speaker B: CPI is much higher. Right.
00:23:54.612 - 00:24:02.658, Speaker C: Like it takes up internally. We actually have engineers whose full job is to figure out the CPI, and.
00:24:02.666 - 00:24:09.082, Speaker B: Then I'll be like, okay, you know what, I want to compose this protocol please figure out the CPI, tell me what accounts I need to put in.
00:24:09.218 - 00:24:10.946, Speaker C: And then we will create an internal.
00:24:10.970 - 00:24:13.618, Speaker B: SDK or an internal library.
00:24:13.746 - 00:24:27.294, Speaker C: And that's all I have to do. Right. So I think getting rid of that barrier would make composability or just projects working together much faster. Yeah, I can definitely see that.
00:24:28.294 - 00:24:32.702, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think runtime V two is probably still a year away, but it's very.
00:24:32.758 - 00:24:34.470, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to be a while, but.
00:24:34.622 - 00:24:35.742, Speaker A: Yeah, but there's a lot of work.
00:24:35.798 - 00:24:37.958, Speaker C: Nonetheless going into it, which is, I.
00:24:37.966 - 00:25:05.934, Speaker A: Think, something we're all kind of excited for. So to sort of hard pivot a little bit here, talk to me about user acquisition. This is one of the things that we hear routinely from games, not just web3 games, but user acquisition is hard. That there's a pool of gamers that in some ways is growing, but is also not growing at the pace that it used to be. So how are people, especially folks who are not blockchain native, discovering genipets?
00:25:06.874 - 00:25:10.962, Speaker C: Yeah. So for us, I think, first of.
00:25:10.978 - 00:25:21.574, Speaker B: All, you're absolutely right on that front. I think in gaming in general, user acquisition, especially after Apple's change in ad policy, has been really, really difficult.
00:25:21.674 - 00:25:24.510, Speaker C: And at the same time, gaming in.
00:25:24.542 - 00:25:26.754, Speaker B: General is just becoming a really saturated.
00:25:27.254 - 00:25:40.430, Speaker C: Industry, so it's hard to get the eyeballs right. So web3, a huge part of why web3 is important for gaming, I personally believe, is the evangelizing of.
00:25:40.462 - 00:25:42.310, Speaker B: The game once players feel like this.
00:25:42.342 - 00:25:51.194, Speaker C: Is a game that they are part owners of. So I wanted to just get that out of the way first, because there.
00:25:51.234 - 00:25:54.970, Speaker B: Are ways to do user acquisition still in this day and age, that doesn't.
00:25:55.002 - 00:26:06.090, Speaker C: Involve web3 or incentive, incentive incentivization via rewards. But it's a lot more difficult. What we've constantly found is that players.
00:26:06.162 - 00:26:08.050, Speaker B: That come in and who are web.
00:26:08.082 - 00:26:10.442, Speaker C: Three adjacent, or web3 curious, and.
00:26:10.458 - 00:26:12.354, Speaker B: Then later on creates a wallet.
00:26:12.434 - 00:26:17.850, Speaker C: Our data show that they retain a lot better and tend to spend more money.
00:26:18.042 - 00:26:18.774, Speaker B: So.
00:26:19.674 - 00:26:28.986, Speaker C: So as a result, I think the hard answer to that question is that web3 is kind of the answer, but then at the same time, we.
00:26:29.010 - 00:26:31.090, Speaker B: Can'T fully rely on it because there's.
00:26:31.122 - 00:27:17.654, Speaker C: A lot of players out there that don't believe in web3 as a concept and they need to be converted. So from that point, from that perspective, you know, genopets, for us, we're not really 100% a mobile game. We are actually a consumer habit app that takes the medium of a free to play game to help you live a healthier lifestyle. So for us, we don't come for regular user acquisition. We're not exactly competing for eyeballs and the gaming world. We're also competing for eyeballs in the self care world, the wellness, the wellness industry. And we've realized that.
00:27:19.554 - 00:27:26.122, Speaker B: We haven't fully tapped into that, but we've seen a lot of resin. The message resonates with a lot of.
00:27:26.138 - 00:27:35.276, Speaker C: People and we constantly get messages from players saying, hey, my friend recommended this app to me for me to get.
00:27:35.300 - 00:27:36.396, Speaker B: Healthier and lose weight.
00:27:36.500 - 00:27:42.004, Speaker C: And I've walked consistently 10,000 steps every day for the last two, two months.
00:27:42.044 - 00:27:44.980, Speaker B: And here's my results. So that's kind of like the angle.
00:27:45.012 - 00:27:54.948, Speaker C: That we've seen that's been pretty useful for user acquisition, and we're able to really expand that and just have people.
00:27:55.116 - 00:27:58.692, Speaker B: Refer each other that way. I think in the coming year, we're.
00:27:58.708 - 00:28:01.548, Speaker C: Going to tap a little more into.
00:28:01.676 - 00:28:05.100, Speaker B: That field in terms of user acquisition channels.
00:28:05.212 - 00:28:12.028, Speaker C: But for now, this is what we find interesting. Yeah, I want to ask you a.
00:28:12.036 - 00:28:58.614, Speaker A: Little bit of a question out of left field. Rabbit released this device they're calling the r one. It's sort of a rethink on what the smartphone interface could be. They describe it as removing the app centric model and switching to an LLM or an LLA large language action model for interfacing with technology. How much of the design decisions that you've made, how much of the way you've built Genet pets, is dictated by the limitations imposed on you in these very walled garden mobile ecosystems? And how would you maybe consider building the game and the product differently if you had a truly open platform to build on?
00:28:59.874 - 00:29:01.778, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting.
00:29:01.826 - 00:29:13.934, Speaker C: Question, because for Rabbit, they're envisioning a world where apps are not something that people built, build, but are something that the AI will give it to you on demand? Yeah.
00:29:14.554 - 00:29:17.774, Speaker B: Earlier on, and when we were planning.
00:29:18.594 - 00:29:22.602, Speaker C: On building the app, we threw, we.
00:29:22.618 - 00:29:24.906, Speaker B: Threw around some ideas about building custom.
00:29:24.970 - 00:29:37.610, Speaker C: Hardware to really learn everything there is about you. Because steps is just the first thing that we're tracking. We aim to track, sleep, heart rate, all kinds of things.
00:29:37.762 - 00:29:39.618, Speaker B: And the biggest barrier that we ran.
00:29:39.666 - 00:29:57.492, Speaker C: Into is that not everybody has these devices. So then to start, we started with the step count, because everybody can track their steps using their smartphone. Now, in a world where there's an open system and we are not tied.
00:29:57.548 - 00:29:59.380, Speaker B: Down by the fact that everyone just.
00:29:59.412 - 00:30:04.396, Speaker C: Has one iPhone or one Android, there's.
00:30:04.420 - 00:30:06.012, Speaker B: A world where we could build this.
00:30:06.068 - 00:30:10.772, Speaker C: As an integrated hardware system and market.
00:30:10.828 - 00:30:12.020, Speaker B: It a little differently.
00:30:12.092 - 00:30:22.234, Speaker C: Right. Instead of it being an app on your phone, maybe it's a wearable, but that's also a game inside of your wearable.
00:30:22.394 - 00:30:23.922, Speaker B: These are ideas that we've thrown around.
00:30:23.978 - 00:30:34.450, Speaker C: Internally, but obviously, given what is possible and what is the norm today, we've built a mobile app, but really, really interesting to think about.
00:30:34.562 - 00:30:43.834, Speaker A: So if folks want to try out the game, if folks want to actually check out some of the code you guys have made, where can they find more information about the project?
00:30:44.334 - 00:30:46.190, Speaker C: Yeah, so you can follow us on.
00:30:46.222 - 00:30:49.998, Speaker B: Twitter, you know, pets. If you download the game from the.
00:30:50.046 - 00:31:03.286, Speaker C: App Store or Google Play Store, you can enter the invite code validated and you'll get some free food and toys for your pet. On our Twitter, we infrequently publish our.
00:31:03.350 - 00:31:13.106, Speaker B: Technical, our technical achievements. So I think that's a good place to start. Or you can join our discord. And I'm in there a lot, and.
00:31:13.130 - 00:31:15.378, Speaker C: I talk about the tech we've built.
00:31:15.506 - 00:31:28.122, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, Albert, this has been fascinating. This got a lot more deep, technically, than I was expecting it to. Really glad we went into a lot of those details on how you guys actually built this thing. And thanks for coming on.
00:31:28.138 - 00:31:29.554, Speaker C: Validated. Amazing.
00:31:29.594 - 00:31:48.574, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, it's funny because a lot of times people think Gamefi and they, they immediately dive into gameplay and in game economy and all sorts of things, but there's a lot of tech involved in composing, defi, you know, and web3 gaming. So I'm glad to be here and shed light on that. So thank you. Awesome, awesome.
