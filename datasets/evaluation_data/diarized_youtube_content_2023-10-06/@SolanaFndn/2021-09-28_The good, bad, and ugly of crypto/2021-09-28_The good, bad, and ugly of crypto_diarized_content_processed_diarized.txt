00:00:18.880 - 00:00:29.294, Speaker A: Excellent. Great. All right, welcome to another ignition live stream for the slant ignition hackathon Meltham. Really excited to have you here with us today.
00:00:29.594 - 00:00:31.402, Speaker B: Yeah, it's great to be here.
00:00:31.538 - 00:00:33.610, Speaker A: Yeah, kind of. Really.
00:00:33.682 - 00:00:42.974, Speaker B: Hold on. We also need to say hi to Abe the ape. Oh, excellent season. So, Abe the ape is prominently featured in every video.
00:00:43.554 - 00:00:48.650, Speaker A: Where did your ape come from? What's the backstory?
00:00:48.842 - 00:01:06.128, Speaker B: I just found him randomly on a trip to, like, a home goods store. They just had a display of these golden apes, and I was like, this is a sign. This was in, this was in June, I think. And lo and behold, look at what's happened since June.
00:01:06.216 - 00:01:07.404, Speaker A: I feel like it's a sign.
00:01:07.744 - 00:01:14.568, Speaker B: It is a sign. You know, when you see a golden ape, you have to, you have to get it.
00:01:14.736 - 00:01:29.630, Speaker A: I love it. I love all those stories, too, about, there's some, some, some famous firms in, in the valley, uh, that when they make an investment, they, they give some sort of a gift to the founders. And I just love the idea that you might be sending out golden apes to companies you invest in.
00:01:29.822 - 00:01:35.870, Speaker B: I should, um, like, look at how majestic he is. So shiny.
00:01:36.022 - 00:01:39.914, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's, like, imposing, but not intimidating.
00:01:40.254 - 00:01:47.584, Speaker B: Yeah. The best part is going on, like, boomer tv and having the ape and all the anchors are like, what?
00:01:47.964 - 00:01:49.024, Speaker A: I love it.
00:01:50.404 - 00:01:55.428, Speaker B: Totally normal. Yeah. Crypto culture is so different, but I'm here for it.
00:01:55.516 - 00:02:08.544, Speaker A: It's its own special thing. And, yeah, I mean, it's been really nice to see that it hasn't changed much, even though mainstream adoption is slowly but steadily moving towards what we're in the world of.
00:02:09.324 - 00:03:36.492, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the culture is just such an important component of what we're doing here. And again, I think, like, it's so incumbent on the communities that we're part of to preserve and extend the culture of crypto as more people come in. There's a great analogy here around Usenet, which, like, I'm going to age myself here, but, you know, every September when kids would go to college campuses, a whole bunch of new users would join, like, this Usenet server, and they called it, like, oh, the September rush, when all the freshmen come in and they'd have to say, spend a month or so teaching all the newbies the norms of this community. And then when AOL came online and Usenet got added to the front page of AOL, it sort of became eternal September because the user count just exploded exponentially. And one of the big challenges was, like, in the face of just this massive influx of newcomers, when the newcomers outnumber the old guard by so much. How do you preserve this original culture and the norms of this online digital community? And so I think that's something over the last few years, we've talked about a lot is this idea of eternal September in crypto. And as more and more people come into the ecosystem, both from trad five and now nfts, and what's happening in culture more broadly from all these different communities, like, how do we preserve the ethos of crypto, and how do we sort of, you know, maintain some of those social and political values that were the momentum and the catalyst for all of this in.
00:03:36.492 - 00:03:52.934, Speaker B: In the first place? It's been really fun to watch how different projects, especially the Solana community, you know, which I think has a lot of fun sort of culture, but also its own unique approach, like, how that gets preserved and extended as more and more people join our community.
00:03:53.474 - 00:04:28.246, Speaker A: Yeah, I love that you talk about that because so often the platform technology is very closely linked to the culture that's built on top of it. You see something like Twitter where, like, it is a very strong community, but it's an in group community, and Twitter is not considered. I mean, the Twitter product team in the last two years has done so many things to try and make that something that's more accessible to new users, but the feedback is still consistently that Twitter is a very hard place to join. And then you look at something like Facebook that has very much lost its culture over the years as its population has grown to billions and billions of users.
00:04:28.310 - 00:04:30.302, Speaker B: Do people still use Facebook?
00:04:30.478 - 00:04:32.094, Speaker A: I think the old people do.
00:04:32.254 - 00:04:41.454, Speaker B: I perceive Facebook as, like, marketing people market to you on Facebook? Yeah. They want to sell you like, soap.
00:04:42.754 - 00:05:39.574, Speaker A: Literally, the only time I open it is for, like, a neighborhood slash building group that I'm in in New York when I'm like, what's this thing that everyone's upset about? Oh, I'll go see it here. Yeah, yeah, it's kind of funny, but, like, with crypto, the. There's this bridging between, like, 20 probably before 2017, but 2017 was when I heard people start talking about the intersection of a financial platform for the world, plus a social network for the world. And not just in the concept of social tokens or projects that are specifically doing that, but that, like, there's a mentality change and a culture change that goes around with this idea of, like, getting rid of these centralized entities or at least downplaying the importance and their role in our lives. And it's been. It's, uh, it's been really nice to see that maintain even as, as, you know, more and more projects, not just Solana, but Solana is getting adoption and interest from a lot of, like, larger mainstream areas as well.
00:05:39.964 - 00:05:54.396, Speaker B: Yeah. But I think in that process. Right. One of the really important challenges is having an honest conversation about where we are in terms of, like, the arc of decentralization. Right. If you will. And again, I think particularly with Solana.
00:05:54.396 - 00:06:22.138, Speaker B: Right. There are aspects in which Solana is inherently more decentralized or further out on the decentralization spectrum. There's still a lot of areas, right. Where there's work to be done, where the network is still fairly centralized, which creates vulnerabilities, and you, you know, creates opportunities for potential censorship or control issues. And this, by the way, is persistent in, in all of these systems we're building. Right. Um, and so it's just been sort of interesting to observe.
00:06:22.138 - 00:06:39.346, Speaker B: Like, we started out in this. I started in bitcoin, right? When I started working in this industry, there was only bitcoin. There really wasn't anything else that people were spending time on. And then Ethereum launched, and Ethereum grew. Like, the Dow hack happened. I actually refused to call it a hack. I should say the Dow incident happened.
00:06:39.346 - 00:06:40.122, Speaker B: Right. Because it.
00:06:40.178 - 00:06:41.974, Speaker A: The code worked just as intense intended.
00:06:42.434 - 00:07:13.370, Speaker B: Exactly right. And I think that was sort of a really important turning point. And again, like, probably, you know, if that happened today, probably would do the same thing at the end of the day, you know, not negating the fact that the decisions that were made needed to be made. But I think they introduced some really interesting sort of points around the vulnerabilities inherent in communities that rely on human coordination. Right. Anytime there's human coordination, there's room for coercion. Incentives obviously matter greatly, and I think we see that even more.
00:07:13.370 - 00:07:48.434, Speaker B: More now, especially with the demand for financial compute on l one s has absolutely exploded. We saw that with gas fees going crazy earlier this summer. Obviously, some of that has been ameliorated by Solana, which has consumed a lot of defi volume. I think you guys are over 10 billion tvl today, which like a huge milestone. And so cool. Obviously, people bridging from Ethereum into Solana via wormhole has been a growing part of the ecosystem, just more broadly bridging from Ethereum into other l one and l two s. I think at this point, it's over 8 billion in TBL.
00:07:48.434 - 00:08:36.260, Speaker B: And that's happened in a span of roughly 45 days, which is pretty crazy. With hundreds of thousands of addresses participating in that which is also really exciting. It's not just a small number of users, it's actually pretty material in terms of the total audience of users. But again, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. And I think it's been refreshing to see that we can have honest conversations about places where there's still vulnerability or perhaps weakness, or where we're maybe not quite there in terms of achieving the vision. And so I think it's nice to be in a place where we can have those conversations without it being hostile or without it being perceived as an attack. Because I certainly think in the earlier days of Ethereum, there was a lot of sort of infighting.
00:08:36.260 - 00:09:04.864, Speaker B: I myself may have participated in some of it, but it's just such a pointless exercise. At the end of the day, I think what we're doing is not a zero sum game. And there's so much room here for different protocols to grow and to flourish. And it's just been nice to see protocols also helping each other out. Right. People finding, disclosing and patching vulnerabilities and being collaborative. So I feel like we're entering this really exciting golden age of crypto.
00:09:05.204 - 00:09:49.122, Speaker A: Yeah, I would love to dig into some of that collaboration and sort of cross chain protocol work with wormhole in those places, but to kind of go back just a second, as someone who's been in the space for a very long time, you've seen the communities get more and more comfortable with. With certain levels of abstraction. Like, I remember, you know, when we first started to see bitcoin used as collateral in Defi, that was a really interesting idea, largely on Ethereum, but then there was a moment where there was actually more synthetic bitcoin in existence than actual bitcoin. And there was. There was sort of two. Two sides of a community, right? There was one side that was very much like, this is not what we want. We dont want to be able to create synthetic assets in that way.
00:09:49.122 - 00:10:10.814, Speaker A: Another group that was saying, this is how the entire world financial system works, this is the basis of something like fractional reserve banking. Not a perfect analogy, but the idea that if you have something and you can lend out more of something than you potentially have, as long as you have collateralization amounts. What was that like for you? Did you come down on one side of that? And as your thinking evolved over the years.
00:10:11.114 - 00:10:17.934, Speaker B: Yeah, let me actually share something because I literally just gave a talk on this. So I'm going to share my screen. Can you guys see it okay?
00:10:18.314 - 00:10:19.094, Speaker A: Yes.
00:10:19.434 - 00:11:07.512, Speaker B: Okay, cool. So like, basically, look, my whole thesis on this is like, blockchain compute generally, right, is becoming a fungible asset. There's always going to be more demand for blockchain compute than availability, right? Like, generally speaking, demand for, the, demand for computation has exceeded our ability to provide that computation. Same thing with data storage. The amount of data we store each year increases not by orders of magnitude, but exponentially. And so I do think there's sort of this interesting world emerging where, like, yes, there are all of these l one's and l two s emerging, but there's also an exponentially increased amount of demand for computation on these l one's or l two s. So I think the question we ask ourselves then is, okay, what are the trade offs that we're willing to make, right? We want to increase throughput, we want to increase speed, and we want to lower costs.
00:11:07.512 - 00:12:04.364, Speaker B: But in order to optimize for scalability in this financial computation we're doing on these ledgers, we need to make trade offs, right? Like, and these trade offs need to be explicit. I think in a lot of instances, these trade offs have been implicit, where some of the problems arise, that these problems need to be resolved and these trade offs need to be made. So actually, the first iteration in 2013, tether, did something amazing by putting dollars on chain, right? And today there are a ton of crypto dollars on chain, over $100 billion worth of crypto dollars on chain. But what's crazy about this is the majority of these still centralized, right? They rely on, like, boomer banks to function. And what's really crazy is that even though there's so many of these in circulation, the velocity. Right, or the trading volume is still 90% derived from tether trading volume. So in terms of actual utility, right, the utility of these stable coins is not evenly distributed.
00:12:04.364 - 00:12:57.592, Speaker B: And the interesting thing to observe there is, like, USDC in particular, has extremely low velocity because it's used primarily in sort of this passive function. So step one, I think, like, the first bridge that really got creating crypto was the bridge between dollars and blockchains, right? It was really dollars and bitcoin via omni relay protocol, right, which is what tether was hosted on, which allowed you to effectively settle dollars with finality to bitcoin wallet address, which is pretty monumental. Then the next step to your point was putting bitcoin on Ethereum, right? So that was really the first asset that moved cross chain. And as you can see, since the start of 2020, sorry, since the. The last twelve months, which is what I show on this chart here, 1.5% of bitcoin has moved over to Ethereum. But again, what's crazy to observe is like, 95% of that is fully custodial, right? So again, we have all of these inherent vulnerabilities.
00:12:57.592 - 00:13:38.068, Speaker B: Like, yes, we can do this, but we have to be cognizant of the fact that we're making trade offs. And in this case, the trade off is you're relying on a third party custodian to custody that bitcoin, and you're relying on them to. To verify that collateral is, in fact, there, right? And then the phase we're at now, right, which, like crazy to look at, is all of this l two activity. This is just looking at Ethereum alone. And as you can see, there's been this massive spike since the launch of arbitrum two weeks ago. You know, I spent a weekend bridging some of my ETH into arbitrum and, you know, ifing into Arvignan and carbon and some of the early arbitrary farms. But again, the l two on Ethereum is growing as well.
00:13:38.068 - 00:14:21.674, Speaker B: So about 1% of the total circulating supply of ethereum is now on l two s. And then if we look more broadly at assets being bridged away from Ethereum, right, what you see here is like the dark purples arbitrum, the light blues polygon. But then, interestingly, right, a lot of this activity is moving to avalanche. You have that in the light purple, phantom in the light green, and then Solana via wormhole in the red. And so it's been really interesting to see, right, like this trend is not just unique to any one asset. Again, as the ecosystem continues to grow, I think the connectivity and the general demand for compute across different networks is going to continue to grow. And I think people now are much less tribal about it.
00:14:21.674 - 00:15:00.752, Speaker B: They're much less sensitive to what they're using, so long as it works. And there's now actually, frankly, too many ecosystems for me to even feel like I know what's going on. I often get very confused. And so it's just been interesting to see. We started with dollars, really, eight years ago as a result of a fundamental market structure problem that we had, which is blockchains allow assets to settle with finality without double spend. So you can have these security guarantees and settlement, you can settle with finality, but it wasn't possible to integrate dollars into that. So you can actually settle fiat with finality.
00:15:00.752 - 00:15:30.980, Speaker B: So tether was created, and now there are a ton of dollars that settle with finality on the same networks where these assets trade. Next step was taking assets and moving them across chain in a wrapped construction. Now we're taking these assets and moving them across chains in a non custodial wrapped construction. And there continue to be these sort of new iterations. One thing I'm really excited about is moving liquidity and staked liquid staking derivatives across chains. Right. So that assets that are passive at the moment can actively become collateral.
00:15:30.980 - 00:16:03.516, Speaker B: And, like, where this leaves us at the end of the day, right. $2 trillion asset class, 8% of the asset assets in the crypto space today are already available on other networks. And pretty soon, I think we'll be close to 50%. And at the end of the day, you know, it'll be 100%. Any asset you want to use anywhere, any piece of collateral will be available on any chain, any l, two, sort of any environment. And so I think this fungibility and portability starts to become really interesting and, frankly, is like, a huge boon for users. Right.
00:16:03.516 - 00:16:38.554, Speaker B: Because it allows this audience that hasn't been able to participate, to participate all of a sudden, like, not everyone has $50 to spend on gas fees. So if we can allow people to, like, take these assets and move them cross chain and to perform financial computation at much lower costs, then it allows us to, you know, achieve one part of the vision here, which is this democratization of finance and the ability for anyone with a crypto wallet and an Internet connection to be able to participate in this ecosystem, which is really exciting. Sorry, I went into professor melted mode there. I'll.
00:16:38.674 - 00:16:43.814, Speaker A: No, I love that you had this ready to go. This wasn't planned at all.
00:16:44.394 - 00:16:49.674, Speaker B: Well, I did this last week. Right. I made those slides on a red eye flight, so, you know, I might as well use them.
00:16:49.794 - 00:17:01.106, Speaker A: No, it's perfect. It's great. So, yeah, I'm really curious to dig into this, because, like, a lot of the times, there's this. There's this distinction created between the settlement layer and the execution layer in traditional finance. Right.
00:17:01.170 - 00:17:01.506, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:01.570 - 00:17:32.062, Speaker A: The highest level of settlement is the Federal Reserve interbank transfer. And then you may get as far down as, like, Robinhood or something like that, which is like an execution layer that's relying on us dollars. But at the end of the day, it all rolls upstream enough to the Fed. And as you get down the execution layer, you generally see more excitement, more increased margin. Those sort of middlemen, companies like apex clearing, they're not making news, they're not particularly exciting, but you could see the opposite potentially happening in crypto. Right. That the, the.
00:17:32.062 - 00:17:45.394, Speaker A: Because the security, historically speaking, like bitcoin is the most, is considered the most secure asset. It's also the hardest asset to use in an execution environment. Like, how do you look at the interplay between those two characteristics?
00:17:45.814 - 00:18:22.058, Speaker B: Yeah, this is actually something I get really excited about. So I think it's important to sort of incorporate the broader trading lifecycle. Right. So the trading lifecycle at a high level, you can sort of conceptualize this five to six distinct steps. There's price discovery, which really is like this chart here, right? Which is like, there's buyers, there's sellers, there's a range in which they clear, which is sort of the tightness of the market. And then there's this broader spread, and that sort of dictates liquidity in the market. So there's price discovery, then there's actual execution, which is the buys and the sells matching, then there's the clearing of that.
00:18:22.058 - 00:18:55.002, Speaker B: And then there's a component called margining, which is borrowing. Right. Because typically when you're trading, you don't necessarily want to post all of your collateral to, to do just one trade. You want to have multiple trades, sometimes on different sides of the book that you can net out to increase your capital efficiency. Then there's the physical settlement of the trade, right, which is literally deleting entries in one database and creating entries in another database and making sure that's done properly. And then there's reconciliation, which is periodically making sure that everything's been done properly, that there aren't any errors. And like, the fundamental issue in this process is.
00:18:55.002 - 00:19:42.048, Speaker B: And this, again, it's like a data science problem, right, or an information theory problem. If I have a chunk of gold and I give it to you, I no longer have that chunk of gold, and you have the chunk of gold, right? This is called settlement with finality. If I have an idea and I give you an idea, I have two ideas and you have two ideas, right? So this is the information. This is the information problem, is when I'm moving digital things on a digital ledger, I'm replicating, right? I'm copying and pasting data. So our ability to resolve this problem, right, with a blockchain fundamentally changes the way that market microstructure functions. And I think this is one of the things that's least appreciated by people who engage with crypto at like, a very surface level. You really have to dig into the guts of market plumbing to understand, like, why the innovation of crypto is so profound.
00:19:42.048 - 00:20:43.794, Speaker B: But effectively, what we're doing is we're enabling all of these things that happen in this stack to happen at the same time, instantaneously on a single ledger without replication of data, which is like, pretty fucking profound. And again, the really crazy thing about this is traditional markets believe that if they, like, add a blockchain somewhere in their architecture, that they'll be like digitized and blockchainified, and like, they're, they'll be able to do things the same. And no, no, no, no. The fundamental issue is in the settlement and reconciliation. And again, this is the problem, right, that a blockchain is uniquely solving for. And so again, I think this is where, like, the fundamental structural advantage of what we're building on chain is the fact that all of these functions are happening programmatically with settlement guarantees that are provided by the security of the underlying network itself. And so that's, to me, like, if I want to engage in a really high value transaction, where I'm really concerned about settlement guarantees, bitcoin is going to be the network I want to use, right? Because bitcoin has the highest sort of security measure.
00:20:43.794 - 00:22:07.556, Speaker B: If I'm engaging in a small series of transactions that are relatively low value, but execution and speed really matters, then I probably want to use a different network. If I'm engaging in arbitrage training or I'm looking to engage in stat arb strategy, I probably want to use different network where I can enter a lot of orders at once and I have really, really high latency. Again, I think there are all of these different characteristics that we can now start to optimize for and also programmability of assets. It's different on these different chains. The availability of collateral is different in these different ecosystems. I think now the fact that we have this entire sort of universe, or instead of having companies, we can have protocols, and instead of having market makers and financial services firms who play these very specific roles in these systems, people like anyone with crypto assets and an appetite for risk can participate in any layer of the structure at being a liquidity provider, being a service provider, right? And again, this ability to from like, to be able to go from having boomers and blazers doing this, to having degens with DeFi wallets being able to do this, this is a huge leap forward, in my view. And again, like, we can trade in these markets 24 7365, we can clear, settle, and reconcile, like, with finality and settlement guarantees in a manner that's never been possible before in traditional finance.
00:22:07.556 - 00:23:18.536, Speaker B: And so again, that's why I spend a lot of time talking about market microstructure because again, I think the more you start to understand, like the structural inefficiencies of traditional financial markets, the more you start to appreciate what is made possible by all of these ecosystems of protocols. Instead of these vertically integrated layers of financial services firms, we're building these flat sort of vertical networks in the form of these public blockchains that enable all of these functions to be internalized to the network itself. And then anyone can build a front end on top of that to add abstraction layers for different types of users. So again, I get really excited about market microstructure because I feel it's like this really underappreciated component of what's happening when it comes to broader public blockchain financial market structure. And again, what I go back to, and I will repeat this all day, every day, every single financial services firm is a crypto company. They just don't know it yet. And 90% of existing financial institutions are just not going to make it, because from an organizational perspective, completely incapable of internalizing this fundamental change in market structure.
00:23:18.536 - 00:23:20.192, Speaker B: Completely incapable.
00:23:20.368 - 00:23:37.176, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good point. It's really, it's interesting to think about some of the other implications of this too, right? Like as you mentioned, you can see a world where the majority of financial transactions are all taking place on blockchain, even if it's using a stable coin as some sort of base layer for that.
00:23:37.320 - 00:23:38.004, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:38.304 - 00:24:51.854, Speaker A: So like if we take this to, it's sort of like its end state, right? There's, there's sort of a few views of thoughts. One is like we get a central bank digital currency system, which gets us not necessarily into a less politically centralized control of a monetary structure, but it makes it easier to bring in state currencies into this sort of an execution environment. The other is you sort of move to a world where you look at something like Venezuela, where like in all but name only, the state currency is crypto because no one there trusts the dollar system. And so while there is still a settlement layer that takes place with the state currency is de facto not used within the country. There's a lot of interesting questions there about how do you either change the way that most financial systems in the world work to not have a role of a central bank? It's hard to imagine our current financial structure in the United states having been able to survive something like COVID without the ability to inject trillions of dollars into the system. We're setting aside politics as a moment for that. That's not something that you could do in a world where the basis of financial transactions is a bitcoin layer settlement or an ethereum.
00:24:52.754 - 00:25:01.898, Speaker B: But let's play that forward for a moment. Right? So we're now entering an environment where like the. Okay, so let's just. Sorry, let's go back like 2000 years.
00:25:01.946 - 00:25:02.794, Speaker A: Okay, let's do it.
00:25:02.914 - 00:25:25.258, Speaker B: Okay, so the reason that ledgers were created, right? Ledgers talking about the ability to record physical things and ious. It's the reason we gave people names, right? It's the reason we no longer use Latin, but we use arabic numerals, right, because it's very easy to confuse latin numerals like the X's and the I, as they like, get mixed up. Arabic numerals, much harder to confuse, much easier to write.
00:25:25.346 - 00:25:28.026, Speaker A: Haunted me all through middle school, right?
00:25:28.130 - 00:26:25.748, Speaker B: All of us has haunted many people through the history of time. But the reason we did all of this was for taxation, right? Because the state has to be able to extract its rents. And we see the same thing happening now, right? Like the reason that we see governments seeking ever greater control over our financial lives is because they need to be able to extract increasingly more rents to pay for an increasingly bloated sort of system. And again, right, just look at what's happened over the last, you know, decade in the country I live in, in the United States, we've seen an unprecedented amount of financial grift. We've seen, you know, we have $120 trillion in unfunded liabilities, include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, in the country's annual tax. Basically, there's no way it's going to pay for that. So how is the state going to get that money? Well, first they're going to start by reducing the ability of for leakage, right? Why is China cracking down on digital currencies? They don't want leakage.
00:26:25.748 - 00:27:02.216, Speaker B: Monetary control and capital controls are what gives the CCP as a regime its power. Right? Same thing here in the US. Right? As currencies money becomes increasingly digitized, the number one incentive of the state is to ensure that it can continue to extract tax revenue from its citizens. The second step of that is, okay, now we start to move into a cashless society. You have to have central bank digital currencies in order to implement negative interest rates. And very soon we will move into negative interest rate territory. Today already quarter of the $17 trillion of outstanding sovereign debt are negative interest rate sovereign debt.
00:27:02.216 - 00:27:47.752, Speaker B: And we're now starting to see commercial bank accounts in some countries have negative interest rates. Now, what that means basically is I need it to make it, as a state impossible for people to take their money out of the bank and hide it under their pillow, because what a negative interest rate environment means is if I leave my money in the bank each year, I'm losing value, right? And it's already happening here in the united states, but that's happening through persistent inflation, right? Inflation is not transitory. It's, in fact, persistent. So annualized, you know, interest rates in this country, the real rates, probably, what, like roughly 1%, maybe 1.1%. Inflation annualizes around 6%. So if you leave your money in the bank, you're losing about 5% of your purchasing power every year. So the government needs to make it impossible or very difficult for you to take your money out of the bank.
00:27:47.752 - 00:28:49.280, Speaker B: They need to have full control, full oversight of it at all times. At the end of the day, the objective with central bank currencies is to implement negative interest rate nerve policies, right? It'll start with zerp, zero interest rate policies, and that'll move into negative interest rate policies. And if you're interested in this, Mervyn Good friend, who's a Nobel Prize winning economist, has written a lot about the zero interest rate bound. And the only way. His thesis was the only way for central banks to transcend the zero interest rate bound is through a digital currency of some kind, by digitizing money and making it possible for the state to extract taxes at the point of owning the currency itself. And so, again, like, this is where, in my view, sort of, like, the resistance comes in. And effectively what crypto is and what bitcoin is still, in my view, is it's this question of voice or exit, right? We can express our descent through voice, right? But what can we do? We can vote, we can express our displeasure at the government, but the machine is going to keep doing what the machine does.
00:28:49.280 - 00:29:31.604, Speaker B: At this point, the machine is so big that it's very difficult to change its trajectory, and it's basically going to eat itself. And so the only other option you have is exit. Right? And for the first time, bitcoin. Like, when I first learned about it in 2012, I was like, holy fuck, this is so interesting because for the first time, people have a choice beyond holding whatever local currency they have access to by virtue of where they were born or what. Or what passport they hold. So we've now introduced sort of this alternative, right? And bitcoin, if we conceptualize it as a digital nation state, it has 300 million members, right? 300 million bitcoin holders, roughly around the world, they sign estimates from Cambridge center for Alternative Finance. So we have a nation state of around 300 million people.
00:29:31.604 - 00:30:27.054, Speaker B: We don't have an army, we don't have physical borders, but we have this digital mind share. We have our own philosophy, we have our own leader, we have our own set of principles and values, and we have trillions of dollars of economic value happening on chain. We have tens of thousands of machines around the world running bitcoin core, enforcing the rules of consensus, running full nodes like this is super powerful. And so I think if you look at sort of the battle that is coming, and I'm laughing, I'm looking at my laptop, I have a sticker on it that says cryptocurrency is not a crime. What we have unfolding is sort of this battle between centralization and authoritarian control. Like, if we look at what's happened, right, the arc of western democracy is moving towards authoritarianism. It is, right? Like, we have representatives of Biden administration going on national television saying, if you say things we don't like on social media, we will censor you.
00:30:27.054 - 00:31:04.592, Speaker B: That's called authoritarianism, right? This country was founded on the basis of free speech and the ability to have free transactions, to have freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, freedom of thought, to be free from coercion. And that's not the world we live in anymore, unfortunately. And so, like, the battle that's shaping up is this battle between centralization and complete authoritarian control and the battle between decentralization. Right. And the ability for people to dissent in a peaceful way. And the primary means for dissent here is economic dissent. By removing myself from this economic system, that is a way of dissenting.
00:31:04.592 - 00:31:41.488, Speaker B: And it's really, really scary to people who are impactful power, because they can't conceptualize the idea of not having control, of not having complete autonomy. Right. But the whole battle we're fighting here is we, as humans should have agency, and it always starts and ends with. With money, right? Because the most prevalent form of violence in our world today is financial violence in the form of sanctions, in the form of economic exclusion. Like that is the most prevalent form of violence. More people suffer from that than from any other type of violence we see. And so again, what we're fighting here is like this really interesting battle.
00:31:41.488 - 00:31:44.524, Speaker B: It's probably very clear to you what side I'm on.
00:31:45.184 - 00:31:46.684, Speaker A: Could we possibly tell?
00:31:47.064 - 00:32:31.680, Speaker B: Yeah, but the question is, right, like, what is the ultimate sort of outcome of this fundamental tension? Like, how does that get resolved? And I think the battle lines are being drawn, but at the end of the day, you know, there's trillions of dollars of value that is flowing outside of the traditional banking system via non custodial wallets. If you don't have a non custodial wallet, set one up, run one, figure out how to do that, even if you only keep a small percentage of your assets in it. It is so important to what it is that we're doing here, and it's so important to the ethos of what crypto is about. But at the end of the day, change is inevitable. You can't stop it. And the question is, what shape will it take? And that's going to be a really, really big battle, and I hope people are ready for it, because it's not going to be easy.
00:32:31.712 - 00:33:12.996, Speaker A: See, yeah, I definitely hear you and agree with you on so much of this that the real power dynamics come down to where we go from here. And so I guess there's two pieces I want to push into a little more on this. The first is what happens in a disaster, right. There are all of these systems in place right now, for better or for worse, that we're going to see cities destroyed by climate change is going to have to be rebuilding funds. Right. We're going to see things like COVID that come up. One of the classic examples with TARP is TARP turned a profit for the government in the end because EVA was able to inject large amounts of liquidity into companies that needed short term relief.
00:33:12.996 - 00:33:45.204, Speaker A: Ended up making a profit. Right. Solyndra is the famous case that didn't work, but on net, it was a positive investment for, in this case, the treasury. Right. Lots of arguments where that should or shouldn't happen. Throughout history, there's a number of economic situations where a prevailing theory is you spend your way out of the problem. How does that work if more and more of the economic value is going into systems that, at least today in 2021, there isn't a method for that sort of injection to occur?
00:33:46.104 - 00:34:09.758, Speaker B: I would argue there are methods for that injection to occur. We saw it with how the Dow sort of issue, smart contract bug was undone. Right. There was a fundamental change in economic policy that unwound a certain series of decisions. Right. And in this case, the sacrifice was immutability. And again, I think we see protocols making these decisions all the time.
00:34:09.758 - 00:34:44.384, Speaker B: And at the end of the day, I think one of the questions is, and again, if we look back in history, right. There are only so many ways for humans to organize. Right. The theory of the firm evolved over a long time stretch of time, because it was more efficient, right from a transaction cost perspective, to employ someone instead of negotiating each transaction individually. Hence why the predominant structure for economic organization in our world today is firms. It's corporations and llcs and partnerships with a blockchain. What we now have is a new structure where we can manage without having managers.
00:34:44.384 - 00:35:59.866, Speaker B: But at the end of the day, the social coordination issues that we have that necessitate, necessitated, like the creation of corporate law and torts and contracts like those issues don't go away. We've just migrated their form from being rules written in legal language to codifying them as like self executing code on these public computational networks that happen to have a lot of financial weight to them. And so I think it's just muting like the social coordination problem from one form to another, which is why I think, like protocol governance, still hugely problematic. There are these massive multibillion dollar dow treasuries that really are effectively useless because they don't actually do anything in terms of decision making. You also have tragedy of the commons. There are some of these protocols that really resemble plutarchy or oligarchy more than anything else, where VC's, who own large chunks of the token supply, effectively make decisions and they're economically incentivized to decide in certain ways. Not a criticism, but I think a lot of what we're going through is like experimentation with social organization, which if you're a fan of like, mythology and sort of philosophical history, right? This is called the cyclo cycle.
00:35:59.866 - 00:37:13.004, Speaker B: There was a philosopher, Polybius, who studied this extensively and basically wrote about how there are only really a few forms of human organization, and how human society typically, like, oscillates in terms of how it organizes from these tyrannical sort of dictatorial structures, these more egalitarian, more democratic structures. And then the balance will sort of switch over centuries, right? Because it's just human, human nature. And so, like, the question is in my mind, like, there's nothing new under the sun. So in some ways, we're, like, recreating the same issues around social coordination, just in a new medium where the stakes are much higher and where there's much more transparency. And so I think the fundamental question is, like, can we create new incentive structures to, or will there be, which changes in the way that we achieve social consensus? And at the end of the day, not everything can be formally codified either. Most of the governance that happens in crypto protocols happens informally, even if these protocols have formal governance mechanisms, because so much of human decision making is contextual and based on group behavior and sort of these soft types of power. And so again, I don't think blockchains make us immune from these challenges.
00:37:13.004 - 00:37:45.214, Speaker B: I just think they add a level and a layer of transformation, transparency and accountability that we haven't seen in more traditional structures. And again, it's up to us as a community, right, to decide what we want to do with these tools. But at the end of the day, they're just tools, right? Our ability to use them effectively is like a whole different question. And frankly, is incumbent on all of us as builders and operators and entrepreneurs and people who build these things and architect these systems. It's up to us to decide what we want to do with that transparency and these new capabilities.
00:37:45.664 - 00:38:29.704, Speaker A: Yeah, I love talking about these things about how do we build systems that are able to police and maintain themselves, right? One of the, I remember the first time I read like Eleanor Ostrom's, like, seminal book on governing the Commons. Unfortunately, she died in 2012 after she won the Nobel Prize. But the whole structure is on how do you maintain a resource that everyone has an incentive to exploit? But then, of course, you can build management frameworks around that that don't require an external army or sort of a boss telling you how to manage this resource that end up being successful. I keep wishing she'd live just a little longer and have been able to see some of this blockchain governance work in action. I think it would have been a very interesting thing to get her thoughts on.
00:38:30.284 - 00:39:01.944, Speaker B: Totally no? And I think, again, what we've seen so far, there have been a lot of interesting issues in the world of blockchains. Even the last few weeks alone, there have been exploits, hacks, et cetera. And again, this is where the collaboration has been so interesting, because again, none of us really have the answers. Right? If we did, like, we wouldn't be here. We're all collectively just trying to figure it out. But in my view, what we're doing here is so much better than the alternative, which is kleptocracy. Right.
00:39:01.944 - 00:39:34.344, Speaker B: And crony capitalism. And so in my view, right. If we're choosing between two alternatives, this alternative may be an imperfect one, and crypto certainly has a whole host of flaws. But on the balance of things, I would much rather operate in the world of crypto than the existing sort of political structure we have, because there is transparency and accountability, and at least we have the ability to sort of codify these values in the form of how we structure consensus mechanisms and how these communities can govern themselves.
00:39:35.014 - 00:40:08.454, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. Have you been thinking about reading about exploring any sort of theoretical models for governance on proof of stake protocols that doesn't involve stake weight? This is sort of one of those things I get often from my political science friends is like, it's a really interesting model, but at the end of the day, if you have the most money, if we're treating cryptocurrency as money, you have the most say, which is not the aspirational endpoint for a democracy.
00:40:08.834 - 00:41:03.194, Speaker B: Yeah, I've written on this a lot, as have many others. I think the other wrinkle to throw in there is now custodians and centralized service providers are proxy voters on behalf of their clients and customers. And so in many instances, the largest voters and specific protocols are actually those who proxy for others. I think there was some really interesting experimentation with sort of meta governance through things like power pool last summer, and I think they had some issues sort of on implementation. The idea of proxy voting has been interesting. Some venture capitalists, in particular, Andree Stan Horowitz, have been proxying their vote to academic institutions and taking their stake in different protocols and sort of giving it to different research oriented academic organizations and student groups so that they're no longer, you know, directly making decisions, but they're. They're sort of proxying that out to groups who are not necessarily financially motivated.
00:41:03.194 - 00:41:34.032, Speaker B: So I do think there's interesting experimentation there. But at the end of the day, I think one of the challenges, right, with the proliferation of all these l one s and l two s, is you now have thousands of ecosystems that require active participation in governance. And so the issue you have, you know, attention really is the finite resources here, and attention is just spread too thin. I mean, the crazy thing to me is, you know, a hostile sort of financial proposal almost got passed in uniswap governance just because no one was aware of it. Right.
00:41:34.088 - 00:41:35.164, Speaker A: That was crazy.
00:41:35.664 - 00:42:13.902, Speaker B: And again, like, kudos to people for trying. You know, I think in many ways it was a really interesting experiment, but it also highlighted, you know, the fact that most token holders are not incentivized participating governance because it is in many ways a tragedy of the Commons. It also costs money to vote. So if I own $100 of tokens, spending dollar 50 on gas fees to vote, it's not really logical. So there are all sorts of interesting paradoxes and wrinkles that we sort of have to accommodate for. But I think in general, this idea of protocol politicians is starting to gain more and more traction. We already have that in a more informal sense.
00:42:13.902 - 00:42:42.866, Speaker B: But I continue to believe that will become more formalized over time and that you'll see people who have careers, like, we already see this in daos, right, where people actually have careers being protocol politicians. And that's really interesting. Yeah, it's really interesting to me. But again, it's like the same issue we have in traditional politics. Right. Like, I'm not an expert on housing issues or transportation infrastructure. So what do I do? I rely on someone who is to manage that part of the national budget.
00:42:42.980 - 00:42:43.318, Speaker A: Yep.
00:42:43.366 - 00:43:20.980, Speaker B: Right. And we elect those people, or we elect people who nominate those people and put them in positions of power. Like, same thing with. With protocols. We're, unfortunately, not all experts on, you know, distributed systems and smart contracts, decentralized exchanges. And so at a certain point, I think we have to accept the limitations of our own ability to keep track of all of these things. So I do think the model will be more, you know, driven towards proxies, rule by committee, a lot of multi SIG schemes being implemented across different daos, a lot of, you know, committees being sort of put in place to help with formal and informal governance.
00:43:20.980 - 00:43:42.684, Speaker B: And again, I don't think it's a bad thing, because in this instance, there is a lot more transparency around decision making, how funds are allocated, how decisions are made. But I do think you need humans who specialize in these tasks and are incentivized, you know, by the protocol and its members to make decisions that lead to optimal outcomes for the largest number of people possible.
00:43:45.344 - 00:44:18.514, Speaker A: Yeah, it's always really fun to talk about this stuff because, like, you know, we sort of. We built the demagogues before we necessarily built the governance. Right. Like, we have a form of government. But it's so interesting, too, because there's this, like, really fun parody where, like, everything on the blockchain is obviously very public and very open, but there's also a degree of anonymity to it where. Where it's harder to figure out the conflict of interest sometimes than it is even in politics, which is off chain politics, which is full of conflict of interest.
00:44:19.934 - 00:44:25.614, Speaker B: Yeah. Like being fed chairman and then buying the assets that you're injecting liquidity into the.
00:44:25.654 - 00:44:26.514, Speaker A: How bizarre.
00:44:27.814 - 00:44:29.874, Speaker B: Slightly challenging. Yes.
00:44:32.174 - 00:45:08.774, Speaker A: That's great. So, yeah, this has been really fun. I could live at the 30,000 foot all day. Would love to get to a little bit more of the tactical stuff around things like wormhole that are enabling this cross chain protocol messaging, and the idea that protocols like Lido are now actually specifically moving to be cross chain but maintain this decentralized framework to them. What has been the most interesting stuff you've seen in that space? What's catching your eye? Is the tooling there yet? Kind of your sense of, like, how that stuff's going along?
00:45:09.114 - 00:45:49.570, Speaker B: Yeah. So a couple of things I've been following really closely. So obviously, liquid staking derivatives have been really fascinating, particularly with the migration of Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake, as well as, you know, the plethora of staking protocols out there. You know, I think at this point, there's over $300 billion of value in staking protocols. So Lido obviously is one. But we've been looking at clay stack as well, which is doing something similar. There's a bunch of different primitives that are being created for creating these staking derivatives and making it possible for people to unlock their stake without actually having to unlock it effectively.
00:45:49.570 - 00:46:32.430, Speaker B: Making locked up stake like a liquid fungible asset, which I think is really interesting. So that's something we've been tracking closely. Cross chain liquidity is something I've been really excited about there. I've been working closely with a connectivity team on what they're building, and they've just seen absolute explosion in activity there. The ability to move liquidity positions across different protocols and make liquidity itself a fungible asset, I think it's really exciting. And then on the governance side, one thing I've been really interested in is how do we. Okay, so totally random concept, but one thing I've been noodling on a lot for the last week and a half or so is this idea of, like, the LinkedIn equivalent for the web3 world.
00:46:32.430 - 00:47:53.686, Speaker B: So obviously, like, there's a lot of people in the crypto space now, and they all make, like, these different claims about how helpful they are and how good they are as, like, christians and these different ecosystems. How do you really know? So what's the equivalent of a web3 resume? Well, it could be like a series of po apps, right? Or like, proof of attendance protocol, sort of participation nfts that get airdropped in people's wallets. It could be things like participation based nfts. It could be belong to multiple different daos or having, like, co ops that indicate participation in governance decisions. But how do you start to build out a resume, not only for individuals, but also for firms and different players in the crypto ecosystem, for how actively involved they actually are? And how do you aggregate and present that information? So that's something I've been looking at quite a bit with a project called RSS three, which is a web3 equivalent of an RSS feed. And so we've sort of been experimenting with, okay, what does a web3 resume look like? In a world where people are employed not by a company, but work on a bunch of different protocols, or a bunch different part of a bunch of different, like, really open web3 ecosystems, how do you actually sort of, like, figure out what their efficacy and their participation level is in these different ecosystems? So that's been really fun to think about. And that obviously integrates, like, a lot of different primitives from a lot of different protocols.
00:47:53.686 - 00:48:58.246, Speaker B: It also integrates sort of new elements that allow you to aggregate participation across different protocols. Like, how do I bring in what you're doing on Solana and Avalanche and Ethereum, some of these l two s, and display it in one sort of interface that pulls in all this, like, rich data from all these different places and keeps it timely and keeps it current. So that's something I've been thinking about a lot. If anyone's thinking about that, that would be great to see. And then on top of that, how do you add in, like, payroll style functionality where if there are people who are working across these different ecosystems, like, how are they getting compensated? Right. And how do you get better at sort of displaying your conflicts of interest by being able to, like, easily show people, okay, here are all the different ways in which I'm compensated her, all the different ecosystems that I'm financially incentivized to participate in. And how do you make it easier for treasuries to actually, like, pay people for the work they're doing for protocols? So, again, I think it, like, starts with this really interesting primitive, which is like, okay, how do you aggregate, integrate all this data and actually track the level of participation and the quality of participation? I think NFTs definitely have a role to play there.
00:48:58.246 - 00:49:58.402, Speaker B: And I've been collecting my PO apps from all the different events I go to and all the different things I'm participating in. So I'm building my portfolio of PO apps to try to showcase, you know, my participation in these communities. And then on top of that, I think the next layer is like, how do we start compensating people? So, for example, we're participating in ignition this month, right? There are going to be a ton of different people from across the Solana participating at different levels. How do we sort of track, you know, who's participating, how they're participating, and how do we compensate them for those services? It could be, you know, explicit could be implicit. But again, I think there's this really cool ability to start to layer these different components together, especially as people will increasingly be employed not by companies, not by protocols, but will work on different things across the web. Three, space. And so it's like, as employment changes, as the labor economy changes, how do we change the tooling and the infrastructure to make it easier for people to, like, exist in this.
00:49:58.402 - 00:50:24.654, Speaker B: This new, more fluid labor market while still earning an income, while still, like, having assemblance of a w two so that they can get a mortgage or, like, get a credit score. There's all these really interesting sort of, like, things that have to fit together in new ways that we're not really talking about yet. So I'm really interested by that. Like, how do we move towards a world where more people are employed by and work for protocols?
00:50:26.194 - 00:51:09.144, Speaker A: One of the fun sort of tangible applications of this was NFTs from Solana are now being moved to other chains. Right? Specifically wormhole, polygon, BSc. But one of the interesting challenges of that is, on Solana, there's a royalty component hard encoded into the NFT. So if you list it on a secondary market, if you sell it to someone through an auction, the royalties automatically flow. So there's no decentralized framework for that on Ethereum or polygon at the moment. So it's kind of one of those interesting questions about, how do we create mirrors for that and then going the other direction. There are centralized royalty systems that then have to be written into the on chain spec when someone moves a rock from Ethereum to Solana.
00:51:10.564 - 00:51:15.870, Speaker B: Love those rocks. I should love my rocks. I should move my rock to Solana and fractionalize it.
00:51:16.012 - 00:51:16.938, Speaker A: Sounds great.
00:51:17.106 - 00:51:33.210, Speaker B: You can all own a piece of nyrock. Maybe I'll just give out, like, little. You know how people would always joke about, like, you can't go to the grocery store and chip off a piece of gold to pay for something. Maybe I should. Yeah, maybe I should start paying people for, like, doing tasks in the metaverse by giving them a pebble. A little practice.
00:51:33.242 - 00:51:33.922, Speaker A: I love that.
00:51:34.018 - 00:51:38.578, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll divvy up my wrap to all my frying. That's great.
00:51:38.666 - 00:51:39.934, Speaker A: You can do a rock drop.
00:51:40.914 - 00:51:59.418, Speaker B: A pebble drop. Yeah, I'll start giving away pebbles. No, I'm 100% down. And look, this is what I think is so fun, though, is. And I can't believe this is my job. Like, this is what I get to do all day is hang out with people and talk about different ways that we can build really cool shit. And then I get to find it and fund it and, like, help build it.
00:51:59.418 - 00:52:02.178, Speaker B: I can't imagine doing anything else. It's so fun.
00:52:02.306 - 00:52:03.346, Speaker A: That's perfect.
00:52:03.530 - 00:52:07.466, Speaker B: And then people let me ramble about esoteric parts of history, which is awesome.
00:52:07.570 - 00:52:15.454, Speaker A: I mean, that's my favorite part about these. Every time we talk about tangible products, it's just like, now let's get, let's. Let's go back to the ledger 2000 years ago.
00:52:16.754 - 00:53:00.626, Speaker B: Well, you know, that, that, um, ledgers 2000 years ago. So you had the ledger and you had these tokens that were called bolas, which represented, like, physical items, right? So you'd have, like, this stone with a little cow etched into it that represented ten cows. Or you'd have, like, this stone with, you know, a grain sheath etched into it. So I think, like, you know, as little meaning making machines, all of the things we're doing are things we've been doing for thousands of. It's just the tools we have to do it are now much more sophisticated, much more interesting. And so all of the fun problems we can create are also much more interesting. Like, infinite complexity is now possible.
00:53:00.626 - 00:53:02.194, Speaker B: It's just super fun.
00:53:02.354 - 00:53:27.518, Speaker A: Totally. And the rock thing is funny too, because, of course, the first place my brain goes is the island of yap. And that short lived period where they used large stone wheels as a form of currency and then had to create a system of basically fractional stone accounting to account for. So they wouldn't have to actually move the stones, they would just have a social consensus around transferring of ownership, which is fairly close to a blockchain, if you think about it.
00:53:27.686 - 00:53:30.358, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a mental blockchain.
00:53:30.486 - 00:53:35.074, Speaker A: Exactly. Right. The ledger's small enough. You can hold the state in here.
00:53:35.574 - 00:53:37.518, Speaker B: It's blockchains all the way down.
00:53:37.646 - 00:53:38.346, Speaker A: Yep.
00:53:38.510 - 00:54:07.574, Speaker B: Oh, my God. We should be banished from having these conversations. So darky. But no, but again, I think it just goes to show, like, there's so many interesting primitives that are being built. And I think there are also really unexpected ways in which people are utilizing these primitives. I'm constantly amazed by the creativity and the different ways that people are finding to, like, use this infrastructure that's being built to create new things. And the cool thing is like, because this is all code, right.
00:54:07.574 - 00:54:18.836, Speaker B: It can all be interoperable and compatible. So it's really exciting. I think we're kind of entering this, like, interesting golden age in crypto, and I'm curious to see what comes out of it.
00:54:19.020 - 00:54:28.996, Speaker A: Same. Well, we're just about a time and don't want to keep you too long. But thank you so much for joining us today. This was a ton of fun.
00:54:29.180 - 00:55:09.184, Speaker B: Yay. Yeah, hopefully people enjoyed it. If you have any questions, if you're working on anything cool, if you want to chat, my twitter handle is out Dem, my DM's are always open. I'm happy to chat and then I am going to be judging all of your submissions. Last time we ended up investing in a number of projects that we met through the hackathon. So looking forward to doing the same thing this time. So definitely excited to meet everyone, see what you're working on and get a chance to hopefully meet some of you either virtually or at Bravery point in November where I will be giving a talk on a topic tbd, but it will be nerdy and it'll be great.
00:55:10.164 - 00:55:37.794, Speaker A: And just want to remind everyone that the deadline is October 15 for applying for your submission to ignition. Additionally, the Breakpoint Global Fellows applications, which are for people under 24 who want to travel to breakpoint. But maybe you're students, you can't afford it. We have a fellowship program available. Those applications are due October 1, so you've got a few more days left. If you go to Solana.com news, you can find where to apply there as well.
00:55:38.694 - 00:55:43.134, Speaker B: That's so cool. I'm so excited to meet everyone. I also heard there might be some.
00:55:43.174 - 00:55:47.354, Speaker A: Dancing, so there may be a very cool closing party.
00:55:48.174 - 00:55:51.154, Speaker B: I can't wait. Amazing.
00:55:52.014 - 00:55:53.694, Speaker A: Great. Well, all right, thanks.
00:55:53.734 - 00:55:53.950, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:55:53.982 - 00:55:55.472, Speaker A: Thank you again for joining us today.
00:55:55.638 - 00:55:59.984, Speaker B: Yeah. And from me and Abe, the Abe, thanks to everyone for listening in.
00:56:00.324 - 00:56:01.884, Speaker A: All right, thanks so much.
