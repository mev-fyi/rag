00:00:04.880 - 00:00:06.694, Speaker A: Perun, welcome to validated.
00:00:06.854 - 00:00:08.022, Speaker B: Hey, excited to be here.
00:00:08.118 - 00:00:57.664, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for coming on today. So, you are the CEO of Gauntlet and a general partner at Robot Ventures, and this is part of, I would say, a very unofficial series we've been doing on this show over the last few weeks to sort of step back from the. In the moment of what's going on in crypto at this specific moment with specific, specific projects, and to sort of talk more generally about how we got here as an industry to help folks better understand the difference between crypto and the tradfi system that came beforehand, and how all these things interplay off of one another and where the evolution of finance has gone over the last, let's call it 100 years, and where it may be going over the next several decades. So I'm really excited to dive into this with you today. When did you first get involved in this industry and what pulled you in initially?
00:00:58.764 - 00:02:25.634, Speaker B: Yeah, so my story is, um, you know, I spent the last ten to 15 years working in simulation based research. So I was actually working on building custom hardware from 20, late 2010 or 2011 to 2016 at a place called de Shaw Research. We were building asics, uh, to do protein folding. So, you know, I think in 2024, people are probably like, hey, uh, why don't you just use more gpu's? And, you know, the answer to that, I'll tell you, is that the head of Alphafold at DeepMind was my first boss. So I think they learned a lot of lessons from us. Building asics, uh, that, you know, percolated into kind of some of the more commodity compute stuff. But when I was working on ASICs in 2012, I believe there was basically, we had a chip order out to a supplier in Taiwan, where when you're a smaller chip manufacturer, you write all your hardware spec as software, so that codifies your design, and you have to give it to someone, uh, in Taiwan or Thailand, who aggregates orders from multiple, uh, different people, and then they combine it and then send it to someone like Taiwan semiconductor or Samsung or Micron.
00:02:25.634 - 00:03:05.914, Speaker B: The reason for that is that the fabrication cycle, you can only get the economies of scale at sort of the level where you're building 100. You know, at that time, it was on the order of like $500 million to a billion dollars of chips. I'm sure now it's a lot higher. So I haven't been in that industry since 2016, so I'm sure it's changed. But basically, you need to be making huge batches in order for it to be economical. And so if you're a small chip manufacturer, in our case, we're making like, $85 to $100 million worth of chips. You have to team up with other people making small amounts of chips to get one big order.
00:03:05.914 - 00:03:33.466, Speaker B: That's the context, which seems completely divorced from crypto, but it's actually very related because we made this big order, and this supplier, this person who's supposed to aggregate the orders, just ghosted us for six months and then said, hey, I'll give you a 10% discount. Obviously, when you pay someone somewhere in the order of $25 to $50 million and they ghost you for six months, you are pissed.
00:03:33.580 - 00:03:34.274, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:35.454 - 00:04:09.112, Speaker B: And they were just like, oh, we can't tell you why, blah, blah, blah. And then eventually, we kind of got them to tell us that it was like a bitcoin miner who basically paid them to take our block space, literally just space, ahead of us. And so that was my first introduction to crypto, was that people were building hardware for this. And I was like, this is crazy. So I was like, I'm going to go mine some on my own. So I mined a bunch. Of course, like any genius of that era, I sold everything in the bottom.
00:04:09.112 - 00:04:16.976, Speaker B: I think I sold a lot of bitcoin at sub dollar ten. So that's just the way the cookie crumbles.
00:04:17.040 - 00:04:17.684, Speaker A: Yep.
00:04:19.264 - 00:05:11.808, Speaker B: But I continue to pay attention. I think the main thing for me was that I couldn't square the fact that cryptocurrencies at that time seemed to be in violation of a lot of basic principles of distributed systems. There's a bunch of theoretical results on how distributed systems should work and not work, and bitcoin was flying in the face of that, I think, in 2015, when some of the first academic research that formalized, you know, why it's able to get around some of these kind of known limitations. That was sort of when I became a believer. I know it's very late, especially for someone who is mining, and. But I was much more cynical when I was mining. I was just like, oh, like, people are building hardware.
00:05:11.808 - 00:05:33.824, Speaker B: There must be money. It was not. It was not. Whereas, like, I became much more of a pure believer from some of these early research papers, which, for better or worse, the irony about them is that they're written by people who now work at Cardano. But that's how the cookie crumbles, I guess.
00:05:34.644 - 00:06:10.116, Speaker A: Yeah. I think it's also fair to say that there's been a little bit of a rewriting of history of how much conviction there was in the early days. I was not around much back then, but I was tangentially around. There were a lot of people that were not in it for a long term libertarian vision of open and free money. They were in it because you could make money running stuff on your computer at home, and then you could, you know, there was a perception that it was not traceable, which we all know now is actually the opposite of true. Bitcoin is probably the most traceable financial asset to ever been created, for sure.
00:06:10.180 - 00:07:12.696, Speaker B: Yeah. But I'm just trying to make sure no one, no one gets some impression that I'm some saint of that era, because I, until the academic research was good, I was like, not a saint, a believer, let's put it that way. It was very cynical. And I think that's one thing I always see about my friends who work in AI or work in hardware or work in academia, whenever they first come to crypto, they always have the same cycle. They always start in this pure, cynical money side, and it takes them a while to realize there's the depth and breadth, and maybe that's a fault of crypto at large, maybe it's the fault of the fact that financializing everything does have a cost, but yes. Yeah, so basically I was working, those papers came out 2014 2015. I was working in high frequency trading by 2016, and I mainly worked on designing the simulation and backtesting framework.
00:07:12.696 - 00:08:36.429, Speaker B: So when you have a new asset, how do you stress test it? How do you figure out like how you take existing strategies and run it against a new product? So like, let's say, you know, the CME, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange added like a new product for, let's pretend there was like a semiconductor future, right? Like where, which corresponded to like delivery semiconductor or something, right? We take that new product, but now we only have historical data on say corn s and p options and futures. Cocoa. I'm trying to remember what the other ones that are having crazy price spikes right now, eggs. And so those are very different products, right? Like inherently, like the demand for those is quite different than, than chips. But the thing is there will be some sort of microstructure stuff that's the same, which is like, hey, these futures close every month. So right around the first of every month, even though they're very different products, different demand, different supply, because people had to trade the derivatives for the underlying or to keep them in synchrony for that arbitrage to close. Theres sort of some inherent stuff thats common to all of those.
00:08:36.429 - 00:09:34.310, Speaker B: And this is kind of one of those things that I think until youre in trading or in finance, you dont really think about, right. You might look at a stock or a token or something like that, and you think of it abstractly as like, this is the thing that its supposed to be. Its the discounted future cash flows of x, its the meme y, whatever. But theres oftentimes these little commonalities between assets that should be unrelated due to these structural things, like how you design the market, how, you know, the parameters of the asset, like what one unit is really equal to, stuff like that. And the goal of most high frequency trading firms is to try to find those types of commonalities and use that to, to, as you're to help you market make. Again, this is like broad strokes. Obviously, if you're working in it, there's like a million more details, but just to give the highest.
00:09:34.310 - 00:10:22.930, Speaker B: So I'm giving you this context because around that time was like sort of the beginning of a lot of the proof of stake papers and research coming out in 2016. Like 2016. That was sort of like when Algorand came out. The Algorand paper, which I sort of, you know, despite the failure in a lot of ways of Algorand, the blockchain, the Algorand the paper, and the research was actually extremely important at that time. But one thing I found from reading that and reading a lot of the proof of stake papers of that era, this is pre tezos ico. So probably like early 2017, was that everyone was really, really focused on these cryptographic things, and they were very rigorous and detailed about the cryptographic guarantees. Like, hey, if we have this particular type of zero knowledge proof, we get this type of guarantee.
00:10:22.930 - 00:11:38.922, Speaker B: Or, hey, if we do proof of stake in this way, we get this type of guarantee. But no one cared about the financial aspect. And I always found, and at that time, I found it very weird that people were treating these staking assets as financially equivalent to the proof of work assets, because they're sort of very different in the sense that the staking assets could be borrowed instantaneously, whereas the proof of work assets, yes, I could go to Nicehash or one of these GPU rental places and borrow hash power, but it's not this, like, instant type of thing. And so that changes the candor of the financial asset. Like, the payoff properties have to be different. Then I started making simulations of proof of stake assets for proof of work assets to try to, like, show that there was this difference, at least numerically, before any formal math, mainly because I just was thinking of this from the perspective of trading, and I was thinking of this from the perspective of how would people trading this asset who are trading the way that quant traders trade, which is they don't really give a shit about the actual asset properties. They just care about these microstructure and statistical properties that don't have anything to do with what the actual asset.
00:11:38.922 - 00:12:20.044, Speaker B: That's why they can get blown out in years where you have meme stock stuff, whatever. But the key thing was, I was like, why are these two things different? Can we find some simple explanatory stuff? Long story short, that led me to, I made a lot of this software to test this stuff. I showed it to a bunch of the people who created l one s and did icos of that era. Some of them tried to hire me. I was like, I don't know if I could work for. I hate saying it, but everyone doing icos, no matter how upright they were in a lot of ways, it's just like there's always some scammy nature to it. So it was just kind of hard to ever imagine.
00:12:20.044 - 00:13:20.744, Speaker B: And so then I sort of was like, I'll do consulting. And then, long story short, that kind of led to me starting my company. And a lot of it really boils down to, how do you think about the statistical properties of these assets? And one reason I keep bringing that up is the normal finance world in the eighties and seventies had the same revelation of how you should think about building new assets and what types of financial instruments should be built. But crypto has a lot of different constraints, and so you got to make these totally new sets of assets that have very different properties that you don't have normally. And so that's sort of what really drew me in, and a lot of it came from trying to understand some of the kind of properties of these things that were seemingly quite different than traditional finance.
00:13:20.904 - 00:14:34.664, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is a great lead in to a lot of what I want to talk about today, because, as you mentioned, the space of trading has evolved incredibly over just even from World War two. The advent of computers, the advent of powerful math on demand has changed a lot of how markets work, even though I think a lot of us who have not worked in high frequency trading do not have masters and PhDs in math, don't necessarily appreciate how different a lot of these fundamental structures are today, let alone the financial products are from what sort of our grandparents or our parents grew up with using in trading. And so I want to get into a little bit of on the non crypto side, the advent of computers changed everything. In part because math was now effectively free and universally available. But walk me through a little bit, I know this is a very broad question, but walk me through a little bit of what we've seen take place in the traditional markets over, let's call it since the forties, and how there's learnings from that that help you think about what the opportunities are in blockchain today.
00:14:35.484 - 00:15:50.794, Speaker B: Yeah, so my very stylized and admittedly, you know, I don't think you can give a perfect history when you weren't, you were still a zygote or an egg of something. But like the seventies and eighties had a lot of, you know, I would say like the 1960s and 1970s had a lot of. Probably the first time that sort of on the more theoretical lens, economists were able to say things like, hey, these particular financial products would be very useful in the economy if you could have a way of enforcing contract constraints. So like, if, you know, if I could have the option to buy stock, if I could buy the right to the option, there's some value to that, some premium that would kind of maximize utility for all participants. The people who have to be long the stock who want the right to sell. And then the people who on the other side want some of the supply that's being created. And I think the idea of options always existed for a long time, right? Like futures have existed since the Mesopotamians in the sense that people would have these kinds of ious they would buy for commodities.
00:15:50.794 - 00:16:35.424, Speaker B: But I think the sixties and seventies, first time people try to formalize the question of like how much should these premia be? Like how much should I pay for the right to buy Austin's coal batch that he happened to go single origin mine wherever he was mining? It's organic. Exactly. And I think the systematic study of what premia should be was really done in the sixties and seventies. And a lot of it actually came from analyzing auctions. First, a lot of these auctions were like land auctions or rights use auctions because they were done by governments. So the data was public. People started being like, okay, people are.
00:16:35.424 - 00:16:57.340, Speaker B: This is the empirical data of what people are actually doing. Based on that, let's try to make some simple math of like, hey, could I make a security or an instrument that replicated or was able to give you an idea of like what the premia that existed were worth for these kind of claims on future assets of some in some way?
00:16:57.412 - 00:17:08.294, Speaker A: Yeah, this is one of those things I always find fascinating. That's the invention of options and futures predates by hundreds of years our ability to actually properly price these things.
00:17:08.714 - 00:18:07.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, arguably, like I said, it's realistically millennia because, yeah, there's evidence Mesopotamians trading with other early civilizations like harappans and whatever, had some form of iou. There is this. And you know, you can argue semantically like, it's not a future because we don't know when it's getting delivered. And. But that all comes later because you care about those things when you want to price them, you don't care about it from a sort of epistemological lens of like, hey, it is really this notion of like an iou, and I expect you to be able to produce x. Yeah. And, but you have to remember that, like prior, you know, one of the reasons that this pricing power, the value of the ability to price was not sort of things civilizations valued was that it was very hard to enforce rule.
00:18:07.278 - 00:18:07.846, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:07.990 - 00:19:02.334, Speaker B: So it's not like you could have enforced, hey, you didn't deliver this. I'm going to kind of go after you. In a legal system at that era, especially when it was like, between civilizations, it's actually very similar as a slight tangent to how shipping law is in the world right now, where like, shipping laws and trade between countries is sort of like, it's very hard to enforce, like, yeah, who's the enforcer of the UN? The UN never enforces this type of stuff. But the point is that governments over time, over this millennia, got a lot stricter and stronger on property rights. And once you had real property rights, it was a lot easier to be like, okay, Austin, I'm willing to, like, I've seen that you've made coal for like a year, and I'm willing to buy your next coal thing. And if you don't deliver it, I have some sort of contractual way of going after you. Right.
00:19:02.334 - 00:19:28.624, Speaker B: And I think the solidification of property rights post World War two was actually a very interesting era for why people started pricing this stuff like a, you had this huge population growth, the resources need to be allocated more efficiently, for sure. But a lot of it also has to do with this idea that property rights and enforcement of property rights became something that people collectively believed in.
00:19:28.664 - 00:19:29.244, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:29.864 - 00:20:10.904, Speaker B: And there was consensus on in certain countries that like, hey, there were these rights, you could execute them. I can, you know, you can have some form of verifiability of, like, whether this thing would work or not. So that's, that's sort of my gesso story. Kind of retelling of how we got to the sixties and seventies being the first time. Now, obviously, that's a lot of opinion, a lot of, but I give you the disclaimer. But once people started really analyzing this stuff, they started being like, hey, actually. And they started to have computers, so they're able to do like basic sort of math on these things, and analysis of this data that was being collected.
00:20:10.904 - 00:20:59.920, Speaker B: People started to say, hey, actually, if you have this ability to enforce these rights, then now I can actually price this thing. Now there's some value to buying the right to Austin's future coal production. It's not just like a, trust me, bro. I hope he doesn't send me fake coal or one of those types of things. There is some real guarantees. There are some real guarantees at this time, things like options and futures became valuable. And I think the key thing is that you needed this ability to enforce rights, but then you also needed this little gestation period of people observing that when people had those guarantees, there was some predictability to certain types of assets, there's some predictability to the returns on a particular asset.
00:20:59.920 - 00:22:09.384, Speaker B: So people are willing to, people who want to get liquidity are willing to sell their rights to those, and people who want to own more of those assets became able to do so. Yeah, and the 1980s, especially the early post DaRPAnEt Internet era, that's sort of when you had the first sort of trading of these assets electronically. I think finance generally is always the earliest consumer of new technologies, but generally is bad at consuming them once they've grown, inevitably. Because the advantage for financial entities is usually, hey, we're first to something. Everyone cares about it. And once they care about it, we're out, which is quite different than a more, you know, technology view of things, or like most other types of industries, how they view things. But finance was one of the first consumers of the Internet and data in the 1980s.
00:22:09.384 - 00:23:11.234, Speaker B: This led to people, I would say, like sort of the UChicago Columbia school of people who trying to basically, you know, convincing these kind of exchanges, like, hey, you should offer these kinds of futures products and options products and stuff like that. And I think it's no coincidence that Chicago is still relevant in finance, that uchicago is also there. There was a very clear gestation between the two. And basically people started making theories about these products. They started writing math about these products, saying like, hey, if the prices behave in this way, then, hey, we can give you some guarantees on how these derivative assets should be priced. So, like, a lot of the math of the era was like, hey, we've observed these things historically. This is how the derivative premiums trade relative to the underlying things.
00:23:11.234 - 00:24:21.764, Speaker B: And then based on that, we can try to say, like, hey, if that pattern holds or there's some sort of stationary, then we can give you some pricing models for that. And those pricing models in some sense led to oftentimes there's things where you make models about things epistemologically after they happen. So that's more like science. It's like I observe some physical phenomena, I look at the data, I try to back out, like what some form of a causal description of it, and then I try to say, hey, that's what this force is doing. There's the other type, which generally happens more in the sort of social sciences and other sort of areas that try to use quantitative analysis. But it's a lot more noisy where the idea that there exists a model allow makes people suddenly do the action more. So the idea that there was a model for pricing these things made people actually want to trade them more.
00:24:21.764 - 00:24:42.084, Speaker B: And so this was sort of, I would say, like the options pricing, the bond pricing stuff of that ilk in 1980s sort of really took off because of to some extent, the fact that there was a model to price. These things that were previously, you know, they existed for thousands of years, but they were invisible to the end user. Right?
00:24:42.664 - 00:25:12.854, Speaker A: Yeah. This has always been interesting to me for a few different reasons. One is there's a meme that finance never wants to take any risks. And it's almost like a joke at this point, where a lot of the tradfi work is intentionally quantitative because it feels like it's a risk reduction system. And there's a version of that which seems silly. There's a version of that that is incredibly logical and consistent. And of course, that's what you want to do, is to de risk your positions as much as possible.
00:25:12.854 - 00:25:40.514, Speaker A: The place I always go with this is it's the stuff that you never predict in your risk models that goes wrong, that always causes financial catastrophes for the most part. But it's interesting to sort of think about the interplay between having the ability to price options and futures, having the ability to hedge your positions now with these tools in a way that feels like it's backed up by math, as opposed to being backed up by more soft judgment.
00:25:41.614 - 00:26:25.858, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I think there's a couple things to unpack there. So I think established financial products always have this. Like, everyone is conservative because they, like, believe their model, and then they trust that a lot. I think there is a sense in which people basically, when they construct these models, I think with enough experience of things blowing up, you eventually become very accustomed to the idea that no model is going to be perfect. And all models are sort of wrong in some distinct manner. Right.
00:26:25.858 - 00:26:33.746, Speaker B: They're measuring a set of points in time and a set of points in space that are not necessarily going to recur. Exactly again.
00:26:33.810 - 00:26:36.586, Speaker A: Right. So that all models are wrong, some are useful.
00:26:36.770 - 00:27:28.066, Speaker B: Yeah. It's just more about, like, what intuition can you get from a particular model? And, like, how can you change the model to reflect intuition that would help you currently. Right. Like, so having sequences of models, having models that are dynamically adjusting is sort of a way of you benchmarking your soft guesses against your, you know, against something that's more tangible. And I think an interesting thing about finance is usually there are people who are high on the risk spectrum taking a lot of these risks, generating this data, and then there's people who are low on the risk spectrum analyzing it. Low in terms of low, meaning they're highly risk averse analyzing it, finding a model. And then people who are in the middle, sort of the midwit, of the midwit meme, take those models and suddenly are like, oh, I'm ready to trade on this.
00:27:28.066 - 00:28:13.696, Speaker B: And those people are most of the volume that gets generated. Right. So that kind of thing where there's, like, kind of the, what's the word for, like, wildcatters? Like, you know, people who would, like, go out in the country and, like, find crazy tribal, search for oil or whatever or gold or some commodity. There's always a wild catters of finance. And I think the problem is the brands in finance are generally the ones who are the risk averse or the midwits. But the wildcatters always exist, and they're the ones finding new products that come from effectively tranching some form of new risk or taking advantage of some form of new types of property rights that exist.
00:28:13.760 - 00:28:14.364, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:15.264 - 00:28:59.720, Speaker B: And in general, those people probably don't get as much historical lauding, but they kind of created everything. But also they are generally rewarded quite favorably by the market that it benefits them not to. Not to be public as much. So there's kind of this natural thing that everyone comes to that conclusion that, oh, finances is boring. Everyone's. But it's sort of a weird thing. In the same way that I would probably call, like, even though you might not think of them this way, like Zuck or Sergey Brin like wildcatters, because they found a new financial instrument, no matter how much they want to spin it to you, as changing the world.
00:28:59.720 - 00:30:13.714, Speaker B: Bullshit, which is not really true. They found a new financial instrument. They found a way to sell things that look like futures on bundles of advertisements. So something where before a media outlet or newspaper had to sell a single ad for a single item in a classified ad or a page ad, they found a way to sell you futures on bundles of those items to particular users where the item only existed when the user shows up. So if they're trying to sell to thirties, indian male with colored hair, hair coloring products or something, if that person never shows up, then the item doesn't exist and the option value is zero. But the idea that that person could show up, and I can prove to you that I gave it to that person, that allows you to create this new type of claim on future rights. And you could fundamentally view anyone who makes money off ads as like, they basically created this, not a security, which is like a total lie.
00:30:13.714 - 00:30:21.694, Speaker B: In reality, almost all online ad revenue should be viewed as a security. If you're going to call crypto securities.
00:30:21.774 - 00:30:24.314, Speaker A: This has been my only years. Yes.
00:30:24.854 - 00:30:26.390, Speaker B: You can't split the two.
00:30:26.462 - 00:30:41.240, Speaker A: Yeah. If the Internet were invented today, the SEC would say the entire thing is a security because there's nothing you can do in the Internet that doesn't involve some form of transacting, some form of value transfer. And as you're saying, some form of effectively a futures contract.
00:30:41.392 - 00:30:56.760, Speaker B: Yeah. It's like sort of a future or an option. Like the, I think the weird part. And this is part of the reason that perhaps, like, the Facebooks and Googles of the world were never prosecuted. I mean, you know, it's not an exaggeration to say, like, the smartest people don't usually end up working in government.
00:30:56.832 - 00:30:57.248, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:57.336 - 00:31:13.886, Speaker B: And so somehow, like, they, they couldn't see this. But this idea that you have these, like, conditional assets, like the idea that the asset is conditional on this person existing. I create the asset and then I sell it, but I've sold it before the person even exists, that is sort of a weird thing. Right.
00:31:13.950 - 00:31:16.514, Speaker A: We've arguably got a strike price, too.
00:31:17.654 - 00:32:01.230, Speaker B: Right. Right. You're creating and destroying assets on demand, which is something I think people didn't realize was even possible. Right. So this is, again, one of these things where, like, technology and property rights can conspire to suddenly make something that seemed not valuable. Valuable because you can enforce things, you can verify whether they happened or not, and you can have high probability bets on them. And yeah, most of moderate 2010s era tech, in my mind, is effectively the wildcatters who figured out how to sell you new assets that were previously unmonetizable, either due to technological reasons, either due to verifiability reasons, I couldn't verify this contract to be executed.
00:32:01.230 - 00:32:48.144, Speaker B: So when, why would I enter it? And in some ways, to me, the beauty of crypto is that it does have those properties very transparently to you when you're creating these instruments. And that's sort of why I think it's interesting. It also has a lot of nuance into how you think about asset pricing, because in the normal world, where you assume there exists at least one sort of, like, trusted party who acts honestly at all times, you assume that that person, that agent doesn't change type. And what I mean by that is, like, if you, Austin, are running an auction to sell your coal. Sorry, I don't know why I keep making you a. I'm a coal broker.
00:32:48.444 - 00:32:50.972, Speaker A: Couldn't have been solar power or something? And nuclear energy.
00:32:51.068 - 00:32:53.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I just wanted something that was, like, visceral.
00:32:53.932 - 00:32:54.540, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:54.692 - 00:33:20.354, Speaker B: Maybe I'll make you an eggs dealer. But given that eggs are flying, egg prices are going up crazily because of the avian flu stuff. But say you want to. You run an auction to sell a bunch of eggs. Well, everyone who's bidding an auction is physically showing up knows that you can't be in two places at once. Like, imagine running a physical auction. You're like, $1, $1, $2, $2.
00:33:20.354 - 00:33:58.664, Speaker B: The meme of the auctioneer. Well, everyone there knows you can't defy physics and suddenly become a buyer. But in the on chain world and in crypto assets, there's nothing stopping me from making a new address and bidding in my own auction and suddenly trying to push the price up. So if I'm the auctioneer, if I can find the person who is the most inelastic to price changes and I identify them, then I can just keep adding bids to try to push them up so that they makes me more revenue. Even though, like, I know that it's non. You know, my bids are non economic. They don't represent, like, me valuing the item.
00:33:58.664 - 00:35:11.064, Speaker B: They represent me trying to push someone else's change someone else's value for the item. Um, that's a very different thing than normal finance. The normal finance, you sort of have these constraints where you assume particular parties, whether they're a broker, an exchange, whatever, has some trust property such that they can't change type in the sense of like, there's the formal sort of economics or game theory definition of what a type is. But intuitively, it's this idea that the auctioneer can't suddenly like clone themselves and also bid in the auction, but on chain, they can always do that, right? And that changes the math for all these things. And that's sort of where like, at least research wise, like I'd say 90% of the papers I write boil down to like, trying to find some phenomena that exists on chain and basically trying to understand where the math of that thing differs from the closest centralized object. And this is again, one of the reasons I think if you look at DeFi protocols that have succeeded and DeFi protocols that have not succeeded, oftentimes the ones that don't succeed are the ones that try to take something from traditional finance. And it's like, hey, we're just going to make x on the blockchain.
00:35:11.064 - 00:36:29.024, Speaker B: Yeah, right. I think a really great example of this and a really great example of the difference between traditional financial instruments and crypto financial instruments is looking at, not to come back to the quintessential easiest example of this, but options on chain options have historically not worked really well. Now, there's a lot of different ways of analyzing why. But the first thing you need to know is that one of the things I think in the sixties and seventies that economists and people in operations research and stuff like that figured out was, hey, one of the reasons you want to have these instruments that allow you to price premiums for future delivery. So an option is like, I choose a strike price. I say, in the future, you deliver to me at this price, is that if I imagine I had an infinite number of options at every strike price and every duration, there is a mathematical thing you can show that says, hey, you can replicate, you can hold a portfolio of these assets such that any payoff you write, I can draw an arbitrary function and say, I want this payoff. When the price is this, I want to get $2 and the price is this, I want to get minus $2.
00:36:29.024 - 00:37:06.656, Speaker B: And the price is this, I want to get $7, right? Like, I can draw this payoff curve with an infinite number of options. You can basically replicate any payoff. And so that was sort of the theoretical thing that made people be like, oh, well, yeah, like, obviously this corn broker, you know, they, they hold a lot of risks. They want to hedge and hedge. They need to like figure out what the payoff is that cuts that particular thing. And like, oh, if options can, with enough options, I can replicate the opposite portfolio, I can be neutral ish, right. And that sort of was the theoretical reason that I think it happened.
00:37:06.720 - 00:37:07.280, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:07.432 - 00:38:25.212, Speaker B: So options are sort of this fundamental object because of that, because they sort of, with enough of them, you can get whatever you want out of it. But there's obviously a financing cost, right? For each strike price you have, there's some sort of inventory costs, like market makers have to be able to quote at those strike prices. And there's inevitably some sort of liquidity cost which says like, hey, yeah, you can replicate this payoff, but it's going to cost you a lot. There's going to be a lot of transaction costs to even generate it. And in the normal markets, there's sort of structural reasons that these types of things have sufficient liquidity. One of the first things is governments charge taxes on fixed intervals. And so theres just a very natural reason to construct things that avoid these tax intervals that defer payment so that you can get a lower tax rate of some form, right? And so you kind of have this thing where like, yeah, you have a lot of these like duration based instruments that have a fixed duration in traditional finance that really stem from commodities are delivered at fixed intervals.
00:38:25.212 - 00:39:42.576, Speaker B: Like, you know, frozen pork belly futures don't really trade in January, but obviously they trade a ton in June. You have these kind of constraints that are temporal naturally from like the real world, you also have these ones that are socially occur like taxes are collected every year on a certain day. But when you rid yourself of those constraints, suddenly you might say, hey, are options a very efficient way to generate these payoffs? Because I need to generate, I need to have liquidity at every single strike price and I have to have enough strike prices such that I can replicate this curve very well. And effectively what you find is that when you don't have these constraints, you actually find it very hard and you charge people per action. So like, hey, if I'm a market maker updating a quote on an option, well, I have to pay a gas fee for every update. It changes my economics quite a bit. And so in a lot of ways, options are just, while they can replicate any payoff, they're like inefficient from a liquidity standpoint when you don't have the constraints of traditional finance.
00:39:42.576 - 00:41:08.544, Speaker B: Now the question is, are there other assets that can replicate these payoffs? And I think a lot of the papers I wrote in 2019 2020 were like, hey, this amm thing, somehow people seem to be using it in a lot of ways to replicate all sorts of weird payoffs in normal finance. You would be like, I don't really get why you would choose a square root payoff. It's not like an intuitive payoff. But then you start to realize, oh, actually in this world where you have to pay per interaction that you make with the thing, you actually want these kind of different payoffs that guarantee you liquidity over large ranges of prices rather than very tick by tick type of things. And so, long story short, really short story long, I guess I ranted for a while, is these assets people like on chain tend to just have very different properties because they don't have the same constraints. Instead of the constraint being temporal, like time based things, it's actually gas based things. Is this thing efficient in a transaction cost manner? And I think that's sort of why you see all sorts of weird assets on chain.
00:41:08.544 - 00:41:47.954, Speaker B: And I think if you look at the history of a lot of these traditional financial assets, like options, like futures, like swaps, they all come again from this idea of pricing, or online ads, they all come from this idea of like pricing the invisible. There was something that like, was unreachable before. And suddenly some technology makes it easier to guarantee, have guarantees on it. People start pricing it. The wildcatters are the ones creating that. And then eventually, you know, people backwards find ways of reasoning about how to compare it. And I think crypto is like the place where you see the most of that.
00:41:47.954 - 00:41:58.564, Speaker B: Whereas traditional tech, I feel like, was ironically that ten years ago, despite everyone there saying, oh, we don't do any finance. That's kind of a lie if we're being honest.
00:41:58.864 - 00:42:31.894, Speaker A: Yeah, most tech from 2000 onward is just a lot. I mean, Spotify at the end of the day is as much a engine for distributing micropayments and royalties as it is a CDN network for music files. And to try and separate the financial innovation from the technology innovation, I guess, leaves you with Linux is probably the only piece of non financial technology that's gotten a lot of adoption in the last 20 years. But it is interesting to think about just how under the hood most of these companies are just financial technology companies.
00:42:32.914 - 00:43:10.982, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like they do a lot of stuff that has some tangible utility outside of the actual financial instrument. But if you squint enough and you look at what they're selling, generally it's like some weird financial product. Yeah, like, and that's that, that's sort of why I find the, the government kind of, we're putting a line in the sand of what the financial product and not kind of like, doesn't make sense to me because it's just like, right. You run into all these contradictions. We're like, but you know, whatever. This is not a podcast term to talk about government stuff.
00:43:11.118 - 00:44:27.644, Speaker A: No, but like, I think to your point, like there, there's all these funny stats about how the only profitable division of General Motors for years, up to the 2008 crisis was the lending department. Everything else lost money. And the cars were basically just a way to generate loan issuance. And you can track this back. I think it was Southwest Airlines that made 98% of their revenue on trading jet fuel futures because they're a big purchaser of jet fuel and they made almost no money on the actual air carrier operations for years. But I think one of the places I really want to go with this is two questions. The first is, given this market opportunity, given that you can do things in crypto on blockchain, you can't really do in other markets, why has it been so long for traditional financial players, even private hedge funds and HFT firms, to enter the space? The second one, which is an extension of that, and we talked about this little bit already, but what do you see as the type of financial transactions, financial products that are really only possible or only economically viable on blockchain? Where is there actually green space that blockchain is creating that traditional finance has not been able to create?
00:44:28.864 - 00:45:11.272, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. I think as boring as the answer to the former sounds, it's really probably boils down to really three things. First, the infrastructure is annoying. Finance people have just not been used to trading 24/7 except in like FX and a couple people who do international equities like ADR's and stuff. But it's like an industry who's entire infrastructure is built around like nine to five in some way and in some indirect or direct. Like there's like some notion of temporal beginning and end.
00:45:11.328 - 00:45:12.040, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:45:12.072 - 00:46:27.828, Speaker B: It's like why do we have the opening auction have like all the volume, or the closing auction have all the volume? Like. In fact, one funny thing about traditional finance is like as HFT grew and people started trading much more algorithmically, you had this thing where like prior to say like Reg NMS, which is the neutral market service, which is basically this law from 2005 that basically says, hey, when I asked for a price on an exchange, a market maker has to look at all the exchanges and find me the best price, like the kind of highest bid if Im selling and the lowest offer if Im buying. It's called NBB, a national best bidding offer. And what happened after that, if you just look empirically, is people's trading throughout the day was kind of random, but it was like you could think of it as a flat line, as a function of time, from 09:00 a.m. to 04:00 p.m. and then once it became much more algorithmic, you saw almost all the volume concentrate, like the beginning of the day or the end of the day, and, like, the middle of the day has none. It's like, it's like this u shaped distribution of volume.
00:46:27.828 - 00:47:11.804, Speaker B: And so part of that was because everyone was starting to just be an algorithm. And like, yeah, you know, even people, you know, like, even retail users, when they made a trade, like it was getting internalized by someone else. And so, like, those people would just hold the inventory until the end of the day or things like that. And you kind of had this very funny thing where the fact that it had duration, the fact that it had a beginning and end conditional on these kind of algorithmic changes, just changed the market structure to only trade at the beginning and end. That's very different than crypto, right? Yes. Especially the very boomer. The most boomer kind of.
00:47:11.804 - 00:47:34.252, Speaker B: Sometimes I find most cringe. People on Twitter are like this extreme trad five people who are not super quantitative, who are just trying to always add fake times to things in crypto. They're like, oh, this is the bitcoin close for the day. I'm like, what the fuck does that mean?
00:47:34.268 - 00:47:35.052, Speaker A: What does that mean?
00:47:35.188 - 00:48:03.084, Speaker B: That doesn't. Varies from day to day and close for who? People in Asia, this is their morning. It's just sometimes you read some of this stuff and you're like, clearly no one is actually paying attention or even just going to CNBC. It's like they write bitcoin closing price daily. And that was a made up thing that some data firm gave you so that you could pretend that it looks like a normal market. And that's why. So don't underestimate these.
00:48:03.084 - 00:48:55.010, Speaker B: The reason I bring this up is the temporal constraints of normal finance actually change the behavior of people. And removing that is quite hard, and it changes how you have to think about the market in a lot of ways. So that's the first thing. The second thing is, of course, the boring one of government, okay? People feel scared. And I think the third one is, and maybe this is the one that's like, hey, there's all this sketchy stuff or Ponzi schemes or whatever, is that this ability to create and destroy assets at will is a very different power than you have in normal finance. Normal finance, it's like you can't just create an asset just for a small time and then kill it. But in crypto, you can very easily create tons of assets and destroy them later.
00:48:55.010 - 00:50:13.604, Speaker B: In the same way that I was describing Facebook and Google is you could imagine they're effectively application specific blockchain in some ways, where they only offer you this one kind of weird payoff, but they're creating and destroying assets, right? Like the inventory, the asset of you being the person meeting some characteristics. And there is an ad that is created just in time to sell to you and then destroyed, because maybe that ad doesn't work for anyone else. That's almost the same as creating a coin, doing a trade, and then destroying the coin. There's a sense in which these companies are basically doing a very specific form of that, of adding and removing assets. But in general, if you look at a lot of things in Defi, if you look at a lot of things in crypto at large, there's just this natural thing where you're like, hey, I'm going to create this token for this particular transaction, then delete it. That form of programmable securitization is very hard for old school people to understand.
00:50:14.024 - 00:50:25.514, Speaker A: And so what do you see as the types of things that this technology enables that really traditional finance has not been able to build products and services around?
00:50:27.614 - 00:51:45.034, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think it boils down to something like someone like Facebook or Google, they, like, happen to create this thing that has utility and then backwards induct a asset that kind of, like you can use for it. The question to me is, like, the forward version of this, which is. Right, imagine I have the asset and I'm able to then use it to create some not on chain utility out of it. So, like, I have an asset on chain that, like, and because it has some trading volume, is able to create some, like, offline or social type of experience that's totally different because the asset exists. And so, like, you know, despite the fact that we're kind of still, people haven't taken crazy risks on this, I still generally think, like, the deep end type of stuff is like something of this framing, right? Where it's like, create the asset and use it off on you offline. And I generally think there's going to be some form of, like, new type of social network, like calling it a social network itself. Itself probably, too.
00:51:45.034 - 00:52:31.584, Speaker B: Boomer. Yeah, there is some type of new thing, whatever it is, like, that is like a TikTok type of thing where vampire attacking the existing ones by having the original asset and being able to create and destroy assets per user is a superpower for owning attention. And you can art. You know, I definitely hate investors intellectualizing meme coins, but there is some truth to the fact that they kind of have this behavior. It's like, as soon as this earthquake happened, there were, like, 30 meme coins made about. Yeah, it's almost like a newsfeed in some very funny way. It's like incentivized newsfeed.
00:52:31.664 - 00:52:34.164, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like one of the trending topics.
00:52:36.124 - 00:52:46.780, Speaker B: I mean, you kind of could. Right? Like, I could make some smart contract that just, like, looks at all the new mints on, like, some particular decks and buys you some rotating portfolio of them.
00:52:46.812 - 00:53:05.004, Speaker A: I mean, just look at the political tokens. Right? Trump and bowdoin are great examples of a. You know, one way to look at this is, like, a silly meme coin, synthetic asset that means nothing. And the other is just, we have created the purest expression of an attention market that I have ever encountered.
00:53:06.184 - 00:53:25.048, Speaker B: Right, right. And so that's where I think this stuff is useful. Like, this idea, the inflexibility of the Facebooks and Googles to create and destroy assets outside of the scheme of, like, the asset is created when, like, a particular set of desiderata are met.
00:53:25.096 - 00:53:25.724, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:27.304 - 00:54:17.140, Speaker B: Is something where I feel like there's going to be a new form of, like, attention collection that can happen. And it's unclear what that is, but I would argue that unlike the tech stuff, where it's, like, we have this utility that came first, and then we backwards find a security for it. And I'm calling it security because if you call crypto security, isn't this shit is the same shit. There's no way you could argue that. I get that we don't have the smartest people in government, so they don't see this, but it is literally the same thing. And I think the idea that you can make these assets on demand in some ways is, like, this crazy attention thing. And that's where this meme coin current thing is, like, makes me think there's some way of that turning into, like, a product.
00:54:17.252 - 00:55:18.534, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's sort of like, there's, like, a moment when I think a lot of people who are just getting into finance, whether it's through crypto or they're learning about it in college, where they sort of realize that low interest rates literally create buildings, that there is a direct relationship of, if you drop interest rates, there will be more construction, and the construction would not exist if not for the ability to get low interest rates. And there's a direct relationship there that feels very counterintuitive when the ability for an asset's existence to create a market opportunity for something that feels very disconnected from the financial world. Like a new office building. Yeah. People very much underestimate how tightly a lot of these things are directly coupled. And it's interesting to think about what are the impacts of being able to create assets on demand and destroy assets on demand for other types of things within fabric of society.
00:55:19.354 - 00:55:56.278, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. There's clearly something about, like, okay, so let's take, you know, I like the 2010s. Let's. I'm trying to pick, like, a year, maybe like, 2015. Like, peak vc hype. Right? Where, like, everyone was like, oh, like, the best returning thing in history was like, should have invested in Facebook. Um, why did we miss it? Well, everyone who invests in Facebook either invested sort of emotionally or they kind of were like, hey, we only care about these metrics that are non financial.
00:55:56.446 - 00:55:56.982, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:57.078 - 00:56:34.014, Speaker B: And eventually you can turn those non financial metrics into financial metrics. Right. Well, what is anything that takes this non financial metric and converts it to a financial. That is the point of, like, a security, especially a derivative security. It's able to let you convert. It does a liquidity transformation. It takes this illiquid thing that you have a sort of quantitative estimate for, akin to a premia for an option, and it lets you make it a liquid thing that you can trade and just illiquidity to liquidity transformation.
00:56:34.014 - 00:56:45.614, Speaker B: What. What do we call most people who do that? We call them banks, but, like, it exists in a ton of places. Like, it's like, Facebook is a fucking bank in that sense. Like, they. They are taking this, like, liquid thing and selling it to you.
00:56:45.654 - 00:56:48.894, Speaker A: This is the closest thing we've ever created to actual alchemy.
00:56:49.054 - 00:58:17.234, Speaker B: Right, right. And I sort of think the problem is, like, if you look at the investors of that era, they, like, they pattern match to that and they're like, okay, like, give me a metric that I can, like, yeah, liquefy. Right? And it reminds me a lot of post defi summer of a lot of people being like, oh, give me a metric that I can try to trade, which is like, give me a copy pasta fork of some protocols so I can do the same thing. And obviously, in the same way that a lot of these investors who try to copy trade the Facebook thing lost their shirts same thing happened to people in crypto who are trying to do that. There is a sense in which the thing, I think that's fundamentally different between the crypto world and the web two world is that the web two world relied on creating these sets of metrics that were illiquid in the sense of you had to spend money on getting customers who were using your thing and then making them liquid via these, later via selling these ad securities. But here we could do that process in reverse, which you can't do in the normal world because you have no guarantees on these property rights. If we get back to the fundamental thing, having no guarantees on how to that owning this abstract thing actually corresponds to this real thing, which is the backwards part.
00:58:17.234 - 00:58:24.410, Speaker B: Like, no one would value the Facebook ad impression before they had the network.
00:58:24.482 - 00:58:25.614, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:58:26.994 - 00:58:29.210, Speaker B: But in crypto, you can do the reverse.
00:58:29.282 - 00:58:29.786, Speaker A: Yes.
00:58:29.890 - 00:58:34.538, Speaker B: And the question is, what things have more value from the reverse than the forward?
00:58:34.626 - 00:58:37.810, Speaker A: Interesting. And that's a really interesting way to think about it.
00:58:37.922 - 00:58:45.378, Speaker B: And to me, those are the things that are things that crypto will be better at. It's a very long winded way of getting to.
00:58:45.426 - 00:58:56.544, Speaker A: But. Right. Things where the existence of the network accrues the value before the product exists.
00:58:56.884 - 00:58:57.620, Speaker B: Yes.
00:58:57.772 - 00:59:07.624, Speaker A: Yeah. Which is interesting, because another way to talk about this is this is literally just investing. This is what every vc does every day.
00:59:08.444 - 00:59:11.654, Speaker B: It is certainly true. But there are things where.
00:59:11.804 - 00:59:21.082, Speaker A: But a VC could never come to the outcomes. There's something about the public distribution and the public market model that is incredibly different than a private market model.
00:59:21.218 - 00:59:27.954, Speaker B: Well, also this idea that the users can create and destroy assets and not the investors.
00:59:28.114 - 00:59:29.374, Speaker A: Right, yes.
00:59:29.674 - 00:59:46.180, Speaker B: And this is why I think the meme coin thing is getting, at some point, despite the fact that there's a lot of bullshit, there is this idea that around every event, people are making a million of these coins and trying to get attention, for it is almost like an incentivized ranking algorithm for a timeline.
00:59:46.332 - 00:59:46.996, Speaker A: Yes.
00:59:47.140 - 00:59:59.172, Speaker B: And, like. And there's clearly something there. Like, I just don't. I just don't know, like, how you channel that into something more that gives utility to, like, the average person who isn't, like, a djen.
00:59:59.268 - 01:00:26.274, Speaker A: I kind of love that. Like, way to look at this, of, like, we've. We've financially incentivized the TikTok trends. Right. Where, like, you'll see it's a trend take off on TikTok, and everyone suddenly is using some audio or doing some action or doing something with their video. But all of that is totally unmonetized except for influencer endorsement. All the monetization engines are very indirect, except for the one that Facebook runs or TikTok runs, which is the ad engine that sits on top of it.
01:00:26.274 - 01:00:38.174, Speaker A: And what if you can communityify that and decentralize that and actually create broad based value creation on demand based on these sorts of things? There's an interesting model there.
01:00:38.524 - 01:00:46.340, Speaker B: Yeah. And you need the users whether to be able to control this asset creation and destruction process.
01:00:46.452 - 01:00:47.104, Speaker A: Yes.
01:00:47.644 - 01:01:48.934, Speaker B: And the meme coins are a dumb way of doing it, but there's probably more than, I don't know exactly what it is, but there's clearly something that is the form of the attention economy where you own the rights to your kind of creation. And like, I know everyone always talks about this kind of like, own the meme, Chris Dixon type of like ownership stuff. I find that a little too waxing poetically, philosophically about it without thinking about the fact that Facebook is just a securities dealer. Like, if you boil down TikTok and Facebook to being like these like sellers of these like conditional securities, then you suddenly are like, okay, well, this ownership thing is also a little bit tenuous. It's like, well, what does it actually mean to own it if the value of the thing also goes to zero at the same time? Like, yes, I own it, but it went to zero.
01:01:49.014 - 01:01:49.318, Speaker A: Yes.
01:01:49.366 - 01:02:39.976, Speaker B: So like, do I, you know, like you have to have some utility measure, not just a strict, do I own the private key type measure? That's where I find these. Yeah, these kind of ownership only narratives wrong. Like, they really are missing. This idea that you need to have this ability to have the value function expressed by people control the algorithm that dictates whatever your ownership is. And in some sense, that is why I think people are going to find something that's like a social experience where you need this notion of like the creator creating the asset. Not just nice to have, because the influencer marketing thing is basically creators creating their own asset external to the thing. They're basically doing the permissionless thing.
01:02:39.976 - 01:02:43.204, Speaker B: And so the question is, how do you make them do that directly?
01:02:43.624 - 01:03:33.154, Speaker A: Yeah, and it does. The conception that ad markets are in some ways just futures and derivatives markets does sort of simplify down the question of why so many of the end state of network products are ad networks is because today that is probably the most capital and technology efficient way to create a financial market for something that is not, as you were talking about this alchemy of, we take something that is non financial or illiquid and we make it liquid is, through today, something like an advertising model. And I think the thing we're circling around here is neither of us knows exactly what that will look like in web3, but there is space for it to be something very different in web3. That can be a much broader. That can have a much broader impact than just advertising.
01:03:33.654 - 01:03:51.662, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that's sort of this. There's one way of viewing these on demand meme coins that are created when an event happens as a. A form of advertising. Right. But I think that's like the wrong way of doing it because it's a form of advertising where there's 500 of them. Right.
01:03:51.662 - 01:04:39.572, Speaker B: Like I said, this earthquake thing this morning, I went and look, I just search earthquake and Dex screener, and there's like 50 coins that were made, and they all have, like, slightly different variants of it. And it's sort of a sense in which people are competing to give you an ad as opposed to the other way where you're fed the ad. To me, that's, again, there's some form of that being a timeline or a newsfeed. That's, imagine just making a product that literally just takes an LLM, takes in the new meme coins creator the last hour and has the LLM write you a summary of a newsfeed timeline. Honestly, that. That's not that crazy. Yeah, if that makes sense.
01:04:39.572 - 01:04:45.804, Speaker B: There's clearly something going on. That's like reversing the. Who owns the algorithm. Like the ranking algorithm.
01:04:45.884 - 01:04:59.732, Speaker A: Yeah. It's this thing I always think about. About, like, how on earth did Buzzfeed fail, right. Is like. Is a question that I think is one that's been under explored because everyone looks at it as a. Oh, well, the media model didn't work. The business model didn't work.
01:04:59.732 - 01:05:13.934, Speaker A: But, like, at the end of the day, that idea that everyone on the Internet was arguing about whether the dress was blue or gold. Right. There is something incredibly powerful there.
01:05:14.594 - 01:05:44.504, Speaker B: I like to think of Buzzfeed as the african cacao farmer and Facebook as the commodities trader, because that is the relationship. That's why journalists who are older, old school are just like, oh, it's like, sucks. The media business is completely dead. Whatever. It's like. Yes, but that's because before the media business owned both the trading house and the content creation, they're like vertically integrated. And that got disintermediated.
01:05:44.504 - 01:06:21.114, Speaker B: And in some ways, if you disintermediate the clearinghouse and the security isn't commodities part of it, which is hopefully what the crypto part is supposed to do. You can, like, there's a sense in which, like, everyone who's complaining about how journalism is dead, whatever, wants to re bundle. Yeah, re verticalize. Right? But I actually think the interesting thing about crypto is it's like, trying to continue the unbundling. Like, we already unbundled the farmer in Africa from the commodities exchange. Now we're unbundling the commodities exchange. So that exists everywhere.
01:06:21.114 - 01:06:34.772, Speaker B: Right. And I think that that's like a. That that's a philosophical difference. Right. There's, like, the side that wants to, like, go back and rebundle things and the side that's like, no, no, no. Let's, like, keep unbundling forever.
01:06:34.868 - 01:07:24.024, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a. There's a world where, like, you know, sometimes I'm talking to, like, some of my more lefty friends and, like, trying to get them to understand, like, how crypto isn't just a mass extension of capitalism. And there's an answer there which is like, no, this is something totally different. We're building community owned infrastructure, et cetera. And there's the other answer that is we've just supercharged neoliberal capitalism, but in a way that actually improves it for everyone, that now everything is financialized, everything is a market, everything operates in these ways. And by removing the sort of private and privileged access systems that have dominated traditional finance for years, we're actually going to create a much more fair and equitable world on the other end of it because of that. And it's a very interesting way to kind of view these.
01:07:24.024 - 01:07:28.644, Speaker A: I think the unbundling will continue until we've basically atomized everything.
01:07:29.224 - 01:07:45.656, Speaker B: Right. And also made things more easy to make and destroy on demand. Yeah, I feel like that's the thing people don't get about crypto is that, like, it does allow people to make things just in time a lot more than, like, the existing world.
01:07:45.760 - 01:07:54.664, Speaker A: Yes. Well, taren, I know you have a heart out, so appreciate your time today. This was a really interesting conversation.
01:07:55.084 - 01:08:12.738, Speaker B: Yeah. Hopefully the genesis of this episode, as you tweeted about trying to find someone who has a sort of opinion about traditional financial instruments versus crypto ones. So hopefully I met the goals of your tweet.
01:08:12.826 - 01:08:18.250, Speaker A: Yes, no, love it. And would love to have you back on some point in the future to dive more into this stuff.
01:08:18.402 - 01:08:19.626, Speaker B: Great. Thanks a lot.
01:08:19.770 - 01:08:20.154, Speaker A: Thank you.
