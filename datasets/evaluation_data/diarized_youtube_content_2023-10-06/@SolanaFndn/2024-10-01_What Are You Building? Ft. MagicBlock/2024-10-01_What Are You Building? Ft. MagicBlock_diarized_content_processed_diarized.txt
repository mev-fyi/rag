00:00:00.360 - 00:00:37.159, Speaker A: Gabriele, what are you building? We're building infrastructure to support how you build fully chain games, which is this niche but very interesting category of games that run completely on the blockchain. So you can create games that are running forever composable on the blockchain and everyone can extend it. So we are building toward this vision. There are two problems. It's hard to make this game, so you need a framework to simplify. We're building Bolt, which is an ECS framework to give off the shelf components to developer and 2 we're building ephemera rollups to scale and bring latency comparable to multiplayer game server to game developers. Super awesome.
00:00:37.159 - 00:00:38.175, Speaker A: I definitely want to try it out.
