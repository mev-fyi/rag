00:00:03.720 - 00:00:14.798, Speaker A: Hello everybody to this week's Changelog. I'm Jonas and this week I'm joined by Mike McKenna and we are both actually currently in Salt Lake City at Mountain Dow. So maybe, Mike, you want to share some stats about that? Yeah.
00:00:14.846 - 00:00:59.140, Speaker B: So mountaindow is a month long blockchain hacking festival in Salt Lake City, Utah. As the name suggests, we are surrounded by some very gorgeous snowy mountains. We have more than 110 people here this week. There'll be a little bit over under 400 people throughout the whole month, and some of the best builders in the whole ecosystem are here. I was speaking to the anagram Labs people yesterday about some amazing things they're doing with AI and Solana th Lawrence, who made the amazing local host validator that has the cool snapshots so you can rewind back and forward in time. I spoke to him a few minutes ago. It's really like all the most talented people in Solana are here this month.
00:00:59.140 - 00:01:02.124, Speaker B: And if you can get here, you absolutely should.
00:01:02.424 - 00:01:41.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I love it. I met so many nice devs already, I think that I didn't laugh so much. Of course everyone noticed last week we had an outage on mainnet beta, so it took around 5 hours and it was on the 6 February in the night, and the fix for this was actually already prepared so it was quickly rolled out and then in the night, like all the validators gathered together in discord and figured out the highest available optimistically confirmed slot. And then they coordinated all together how to get the restart going on that one. And then it was restarted. So it was resolved after about 5 hours, which is nice that it went very quickly. But yeah, it's still of course bad for the ecosystem and Solana in general.
00:01:41.754 - 00:02:12.886, Speaker A: So you can follow the whole report that Ansar prepared on Solana.com news. And there you can see all the details, exactly what went down, what the exact bug was. And yeah, definite was not down in that time. So if you're a developer, you might have in the past have had some problems getting Devnet Sol. So now we have this nice guide here, which just shows you a bunch of ways how you can get Devnet Sol. So first one is of course Solana Cli, you can just type Solana's airdrop two or five.
00:02:12.886 - 00:02:44.624, Speaker A: So you can get ten sol per day like this. Then we have the web faucet, which has a way higher airdrop limit. And one cool thing that was added this week is actually now you can also add a GitHub login and then you can get an even higher amount of sol every hour. Then there's also a few RPC providers which run their own faucets. So if you use their URL when you request the airdrop, then you have a way better chance of getting sold. So there like Helios, quicknode and Triton have this actually at the moment. So they're also running Defnet validators.
00:02:44.624 - 00:03:27.182, Speaker A: And then we also have a proof of workforce in case you need higher amounts. You can just install this tool and let it run for a while and it will generate salt for you over time. Then there's also a few discord communities like the Lampert Dao and the 76 devs discord. So they run in their bots here in discord. So like with Gibsal you can get something. And my favorite tip is actually that you just use Solana program show minus minus buffers, which shows you all the buffers that you already have and then you can just close them. Or a Solana program show minus minus programs, and I have 25 programs deployed and you can just close a few of them probably, and then just reuse this all.
00:03:27.182 - 00:04:08.274, Speaker A: So it's like a very sustainable way on going forward with that. So this is one of the guides, there's another one. So we have a new version of SPL JavaScript SDK, the version 0.40. And this one has some improvements on how the transfer hooks works. So there's especially, there are some helper functions now which can very easily get you all the additional accounts that you need for the transfer hooks. So this guide is updated now, and there's like a hello world, there's a counter program and a more complex example which shows you how you can use a delegate to have transfer fees. So check out this guide, and then every one of the examples also has a link which directly opens the code in Solana Playground, which makes it very easy to use.
00:04:08.274 - 00:04:26.952, Speaker A: And if you want to write your own guides like this, so if you want to help and participate, there's the repository developer content. So you can just like if you have a good guide or you want to like help the community, you can open a GitHub like pull request here and then we will look at it and merge it.
00:04:27.128 - 00:05:03.104, Speaker B: One other thing that is amazing is we have this scribes hackathon coming up. So if you're into documentation, there are $137,390 worth of prizes. And originally when I heard about this, I thought it was just for kind of technical documentation. It is really the whole world of Solana. So it's economics, it's defi. It's communication. It's things like poems and thought provoking essays.
00:05:03.104 - 00:05:46.342, Speaker B: Where can we take this technology? There's memes, there is all types of just amazing public goods gaming. This is the first hackathon in Solana that's just been about writing. So if you want to create the kind of documentation you always wish you had, if you've got some thoughts about blockchain or the future of the economy or the world, or how we transmit value to each other, yeah, this is the time to get published and get paid for doing so. So I'm very excited about this.
00:05:46.478 - 00:05:52.310, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's great. It's run by Lampard Dao and also Helios is involved. I think so. Yeah. Check this out. Yeah.
00:05:52.342 - 00:06:12.184, Speaker B: Some amazing sponsors there. One other thing which is also great is that we now have a new doc site. It used to be docs dot solana.com, now it's solana.com dox. And it's more than just URL change. There's a lot of effort here into making sure the doc site is a lot better, a lot more navigable.
00:06:12.184 - 00:06:49.474, Speaker B: We have those little anchor links in the middle of documents so you can deep link into something. We have a beautiful GitHub page which will take you straight to edit that specific document. So if you're unhappy with anything, you can actually modify it and it will send us a pr to review. And we're putting a lot of effort into basically making sure we're producing less documents that are better maintained. So we're retiring a lot of the older docs and really just merging it into one place. And that place to find everything will be Solana.com docs.
00:06:49.894 - 00:07:02.514, Speaker A: Yeah. So they moved from docs dot solana.com to solana.com docs and they're now also split. So yeah, it's way easier to change now. Yeah. Just very, very good for the future.
00:07:02.814 - 00:07:24.014, Speaker B: If you haven't been, if you're a Solana developer and you haven't been here in the past, it's worth coming back because we are constantly working on these docs and yeah, come back and see what's changed. And again, if you're not happy, we have the Solana developers Twitter account where dev ecosystem hangs out. And you can just talk to us there or on GitHub.
00:07:24.134 - 00:07:24.886, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:25.070 - 00:07:41.034, Speaker B: One other great thing in Solana is users helping each other. So we have the Solana Stack exchange. I'm fairly active on there. Join us. I know you are too. And we're going to give a shout out to some of the new users. So Fuzzy Yeti has had 298 points in only 44 days.
00:07:41.034 - 00:08:13.718, Speaker B: Way Sol has gotten 240 points in only 21 days. It is, yeah, the stack exchange is great. There's a lot of really active, interesting questions being asked, and we want to encourage you if you get help from a stack exchange question and answer vote. Make sure you vote for the answer, but also make sure you vote for the question too, because that person who asked that question probably saved you a bunch of time, just as the person who provided the answer did. I love Solana stack exchange.
00:08:13.806 - 00:08:14.678, Speaker A: Yeah, me too.
00:08:14.806 - 00:08:37.494, Speaker B: If you search based on the specific error you're actually having, you can get answers almost instantly. Even for things that I have kind of, I think previously would have, like, copy and pasted between projects. I now just look at some of like, my own answers on Solana stag Exchange just because it's more easily findable.
00:08:37.914 - 00:08:42.162, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great that the content, the answers are googleable now. So it's really nice.
00:08:42.218 - 00:09:03.686, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I am so, like, it's. I think Jacob was really, really smart to set this up. I love it so much. So, yeah, it's Solana Stack Exchange. Honestly, if you're, if you, you have any error message on the console, if it's not obvious what it is, paste it into Solana Stack Exchange and you'll probably find an answer almost immediately.
00:09:03.830 - 00:09:06.382, Speaker A: Yeah. Did you see any interesting commits this week?
00:09:06.558 - 00:09:44.684, Speaker B: Yes, this is an interesting one, and it took us a little while to work out what this was. This is actually by one of the people who runs Jito, which is actually right now is 51% of all Solana validators use Jito. So there's the Jito validator. There's the ansel validator. And soon, coming up, there's jump fire dancers. Many people are excited about, and there'll be more validators on the way. This took, me and Jonas were actually talking about this before the podcast started, and it took us a little while to kind of work out what was going on because we couldn't work out what was the difference between tipping and priority fees.
00:09:44.684 - 00:10:35.192, Speaker B: And I don't have a lot of experience in the MeV Jito world, but this is a really interesting read. So it turns out that tipping is something you can add to your transactions that only gets paid if the transaction actually goes through. So the leader will receive that tip if it processes the transaction, as opposed to a priority fee, which is taken even if the transaction does not immediately go through. So yeah, this is interesting. Again, this is an ongoing discussion. It's worth checking out and reading people talking about how to implement this and whether it's a good idea. But yeah, it's basically standardizing something that is already a popular practice in the Jito world and making it really part of the Solana core protocol.
00:10:35.368 - 00:11:06.454, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's very interesting, the different solutions that they discuss here. The first solution is like having a tip program, but this would not go very well with having multiple transactions. So they are also proposing having syscall to directly fund Sol to the current leader. So it's very interesting discussion if you want to scroll through this and participate yourself. And we were just talking about fees. So there's also SMD, which is still ongoing.
00:11:06.454 - 00:11:43.416, Speaker A: We talked about it earlier, but it's a very big discussion here. So you can see there are lots of comments. And this is like for having exponentially increasing fees on accounts. So this is, for example, important if you have very heavily congested state, like during an NFT mint or recently we had this big token airdrop that you all have noticed probably. So, yeah, please follow the discussions in here, and you can see lots of statistics on fees. And everyone has different ideas, so it's very difficult to find a perfect solution for this. Of course.
00:11:43.416 - 00:11:56.184, Speaker A: Yeah. Here you can see, for example, the statistics during the last airdrop. So, yeah, go into the discussions and participate yourself and try to help improve the future of Solana.
00:11:56.344 - 00:11:57.536, Speaker B: I think that's it.
00:11:57.720 - 00:12:07.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's already half this week. So, yeah, come visit us at Mountain Dao if you're close by. And yeah, see you all next week. Excellent.
00:12:07.302 - 00:12:08.886, Speaker B: See you guys. Bye.
