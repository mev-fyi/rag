00:00:05.600 - 00:00:31.865, Speaker A: We are a small place. They can put the screws on us. It's not so easy today. This is our modern city. Ten years from now, this will be a metropolis. Even if you are going to lure me into the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I'll get out.
00:00:31.895 - 00:00:32.465, Speaker B: Out.
00:00:35.405 - 00:01:24.481, Speaker A: And because the people supported us, therefore we succeeded. It just wasn't guts on our part. It was guts on our part. Of a total population. A total population refused to be cow. Yeah. Hello.
00:01:24.553 - 00:01:27.481, Speaker B: Hello. Hello.
00:01:27.513 - 00:01:27.825, Speaker C: Hello.
00:01:27.865 - 00:01:31.671, Speaker B: Hello. My name is Cash Donda. I am the Sherpa of Super Team.
00:01:31.833 - 00:01:34.771, Speaker C: I'm Lily. I'm a public servant from the Solana foundation.
00:01:34.883 - 00:02:06.165, Speaker B: And we are thrilled to welcome you to the biggest Breakpoint ever. Folks, make some noise for Breakpoint 2024. Yeah, we sold more than 6,000 tickets, have more than 114 countries represented, and have what feels like 76,000 different side events over this weekend. It is going to be two days worth remembering, I think over the next 15 minutes or so. What we want to do is talk about how Solana is different and how that's reflected in everything that you see in Breakpoint 2024.
00:02:06.585 - 00:02:31.575, Speaker C: This is also our first break point in Asia because Solana is global. Let's get a shout out who flew more than 10 hours to get here. Amazing. Welcome, as we say in Chinese, meaning it's a pleasure to gather our good friends from around the world. Cash, anything in Hindi from you?
00:02:32.715 - 00:02:38.215, Speaker B: I only know one word in Hindi and it starts with behin. And we're not going to say it here, so let's move right along.
00:02:39.835 - 00:03:09.885, Speaker C: Okay, let's move on. The idea for Solana started on a little beach in California. Today, Solana's validators, developers and users are in basically every country in the world. And Asia is leading the way. 40% of our users, 50% of developers in the last hackathon, and as has been true from the start of crypto time, 70% of global liquidity originates here in Asia.
00:03:10.225 - 00:03:30.735, Speaker B: It's pretty incredible. But underlying all of these users, these developers, this liquidity, is Solana the network. It really is. As the cliche goes, all about the tech, Solana itself started with a somewhat radical idea that the network should actually continuously get better. And that's what we're going to talk about at Breakpoint over the next few days.
00:03:31.555 - 00:04:01.105, Speaker C: And validators are, of course, the backbone of the network. Today we've got almost 1400 validators. This year alone, there's been $385 million of fees collected. Four validators and from Genesis, 37 billion validated transactions, not including vote transactions. And for anyone who's counting, this year, we've validated four times the transactions of all EVM chains combined.
00:04:04.085 - 00:04:31.623, Speaker B: So, Lily, you're saying size matters, and Solana is bigger, and it's getting even bigger going forward. And I think this is really the key point of Breakpoint, right? We have some performance, but it's not enough to have performance. It's about performance and progress. And so over the next two days, we're gonna hear from a bunch of teams that are making the network better. We have Syndica and Jito with their alternative validator clients, and this little team. What are they called? Fire Dancer. Has anyone here heard of Fire Dancer? People excited about Fire Dancer.
00:04:31.623 - 00:04:56.687, Speaker B: All right, some Kevin effing Bowers fans in the audience. That's good to see. These teams are chewing a ludicrous amount of glass to. To make sure that the network becomes more resilient over time. But it's not just happening on the validator side. We're seeing other improvements to the network that allow us to scale beyond just transactions per second so that builders can actually create new value in the world. So you're going to hear about ZK compression, which brings down the cost of state by a thousand times.
00:04:56.687 - 00:05:12.325, Speaker B: You're going to hear about token extensions, which allow institutions like PayPal and PyUSD to come on chain when they could not have before. And we're going to hear about actions and blinks, which allow developers a new go to market avenue in places that were previously cut off from them, like Twitter, Reddit, YouTube and many others.
00:05:12.865 - 00:05:37.349, Speaker C: So constant innovation is critical because fundamentally, Solana is infrastructure for applications. We're not infrastructure for infrastructure. We're not building a bridge on top of a road on top of a tunnel. That's not what we mean by composability. Ultimately, the network gets used when you have applications. And Solana is production ready today.
00:05:37.517 - 00:05:42.585, Speaker B: It's one of my favorite things about Solana, right? We're building for real users, not just for podcasts.
00:05:43.005 - 00:05:47.837, Speaker C: Do you have something against podcasts? Didn't Super Team start as a podcast, like the baby of a podcast?
00:05:47.901 - 00:06:04.003, Speaker B: Cash, I am a podcast baby. I do love podcasts, but podcasts don't pay priority fees. It's users using real applications that do that. And every team on this slide right here is building towards a future where everyday people can use Solana every single day.
00:06:04.179 - 00:06:22.995, Speaker C: And that is why we are trying a new format here at Breakpoint. Product keynotes. You might need 50 minutes on stage to walk through a white paper. But you only need 5 minutes for a product. 5 slides, 5 minutes show not tell TikTok meet crypto conference we have.
00:06:23.075 - 00:06:36.235, Speaker B: This is just a small selection of the talks that you're going to hear. There are 78, eight lightning product talks happening over the next two days, crossing every sector you heal from apps, building in the creator economy, depin gaming and much much more.
00:06:36.695 - 00:07:17.353, Speaker C: Ultimately all of these different application spaces need a robust financial layer to thrive. So Solana is building an on chain economy. That's the original vision of Bitcoin where there's an Internet connection, there's a bank account, it's the Internet of money. And Solana's on chain economy is thriving. We are making the original vision of programmable money real. A strong city needs a strong economy. Self custody means digital property rights, which means on chain financial access for anyone with an Internet connection, which means economic sovereignty and ultimately self sovereignty.
00:07:17.353 - 00:07:57.043, Speaker C: So you're going to hear from a lot of folks in kind of the financial sector who are building out the financial value chain on the asset side, stablecoin, real world asset issuers. Because on chain payments, stablecoins are the lifeblood of the on chain economy. Today you're going to hear about infrastructure for payments and commerce. And from trading venues you're going to hear from some of our most loved defi protocols who are also some of the most used in the entire industry. And of course from CEFI players as well, who are the cornerstone of our industry as well. The salon economy here is where suits and neckbeards bring them together.
00:07:57.139 - 00:08:21.773, Speaker B: That's a beautiful thing, I gotta say. But again, the spirit here is to show, not just to tell. And so you can actually use Solana Tech outside of just these conference walls. First, a big shout out to backpack Meteora and straight sex who launched an SGD stablecoin which you can now use using your backpack wallet to pay any merchant inside of Suntec City, inside of this whole convention center. It's pretty cool. Yeah, right. Real world utility, it's a nice thing.
00:08:21.773 - 00:08:53.465, Speaker B: And then outside of the convention center you can actually load up grab with USDC on Solana so that you can pay for rides or food or anything else you need across Singapore. And then beyond that we have Travola where you can actually use usdt, USDC or Seoul to book flights. And as a little special gift for everybody who came early this morning, they're giving $50 to anybody who scans that QR code right now for your next flight. I see some phones Coming out. I'm going to pretend that you are taking photos of me and Lily this whole time. There you go. All right.
00:08:53.465 - 00:09:04.785, Speaker B: Imagine this a technology conference where you can actually use the technology. It's a crazy concept. I know. And I'm really excited to see this programmable money and this on chain economy thesis playing out here.
00:09:05.525 - 00:09:23.523, Speaker C: Actually, we can't take credit for this. This is original vision from Satoshi. And thousands of early bitcoiners starting about 15 years ago around the world started talking about it. We're helping to build it, make it real. And hopefully we think Solana can help advance this original vision of bitcoin.
00:09:23.699 - 00:09:41.293, Speaker B: I think that's what's great about Solana is that we can build on the shoulders of giants without being precious about the ideology and where it kind of came from. Right. Because fundamentally, Solana is for everybody. Let's just do a little quick poll here. How many people here kind of started with bitcoin or fans of bitcoin? Make some noise. Yeah. All right.
00:09:41.293 - 00:09:46.373, Speaker B: Some bitcoiners. How about Ethereum? It's all right. You can say it. Yeah. A bunch of folks. Yeah. Cosmos.
00:09:46.373 - 00:10:00.255, Speaker B: I see some other hands coming up. Yeah. This is great. Right? I know, Lily, you started with bitcoin, I started with Ethereum and that's just fine. But we both ended up building on Solana for one simple reason. Right. We belong to the tribe of self custody at the end of the day.
00:10:00.755 - 00:10:27.525, Speaker C: That's right. We're here to onboard 1 billion people into self custody. I think that's our shared purpose. And Solana is not a place for maximalists. You might even be surprised to know we don't consider ourselves Solana maximalists. We are Solana rationalists. To bring self custody to 1 billion people, we've got to enable consumer experiences that are fluid, as you would expect in web 2 for products that can only be built on web 3.
00:10:27.825 - 00:10:57.205, Speaker B: And as rationalists, we want to see the best ideas win, which is why I'm super excited about this new format that we're bringing to Breakpoint for the first time ever. Debates, not panels. Right. The goal here is to bring crypto Twitter onto the stage because we've all been to the conferences where the talks are, you know, they're fine, whatever. But the most interesting arguments are happening over beers or in the hallways. That's the energy that we want to bring on stage this time around and see whichever the best ideas are, let them win, no matter where they come from or who is actually putting them forward.
00:10:57.365 - 00:11:18.761, Speaker C: All right, so that's it for the two new formats, debates and product keynotes. A couple of things about the venue itself. This might be your first conference you've been to that has a built in IQ test. So we've got two stages. You're on the left curve stage right now. It's for markets and business. There's also a right curve stage which is focused on tech and products.
00:11:18.761 - 00:11:26.281, Speaker C: Please keep in mind the left curve stage when you come in is on your right and the right curve stage when you come in is on your left.
00:11:26.433 - 00:11:56.139, Speaker B: Yeah, and if that is too complicated for you, there's a banking conference down the street which might be more your speed. In between the two stages we have Basecamp which is another place where you can actually feel Solana for yourself. We have more than 60 teams from around the world demoing their products. So you can feel what is possible on Solana, not just read about it here. And lastly, Lily, I hear that there's some rumors of BDE this year at Solana Cash.
00:11:56.227 - 00:11:57.083, Speaker C: Did you write these slides?
00:11:57.139 - 00:11:58.179, Speaker B: What's going on here?
00:11:58.347 - 00:12:09.303, Speaker C: Although you are right, Solana does have the best developer energy. So Coliseums arena is across the way. It's kind of like a hacker house. Breakpoint.
00:12:09.439 - 00:12:21.551, Speaker B: That's right. Well, if that feels like a lot of stuff. It is, because it is a lot of stuff. But don't worry, we got you covered. Everyone in this audience should download this app right now. You can scan this QR code. It'll help you get around.
00:12:21.551 - 00:12:36.405, Speaker B: This whole conference is going to move at the speed of Solana, which is great for blockchains and tougher for like IRL conferences. Talks are five minutes. It's going to be easy to miss them. Right? So you want to make sure you go on there. You can heart the talks that you really want to see and build out your schedule A accordingly to get the most out of it.
00:12:36.565 - 00:12:46.789, Speaker C: All right, so that's break point in a nutshell. Before we go, just one last thought. Beyond the tech, the applications on chain economy, ultimately Solana is you.
00:12:46.917 - 00:13:14.835, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is super important to understand, right? Solana is not a GitHub repo or an abstract white paper. It is all of us in this room right now, everybody watching at home as well is the people putting value into the network. Right? It is you with the bloody eyes from coding until 3:00 in the morning. It is you with a telegram addiction. It is you arguing about memes around economic security until your family is ready to disown you. I'm looking at you totally over here on that last one.
00:13:15.135 - 00:13:32.267, Speaker C: All right, so to borrow from a great leader, a country needs to build up its own core of entrepreneurs. It is not just top leaders, but leaders at all levels. As we say, sometimes internally, the point of decentralization is not the absence of leaders, but the abundance of leaders.
00:13:32.451 - 00:13:40.635, Speaker B: And as I look around into this crowd right now, that is exactly what I see. Let's make this the best break point yet. Thank you very much for coming out, everybody.
