00:00:00.760 - 00:00:06.574, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other, we're not gonna make it. Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew.
00:00:06.694 - 00:00:10.342, Speaker B: Most of the time, I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life.
00:00:10.478 - 00:00:13.022, Speaker A: A face full of glass hurts like hell when you're in it.
00:00:13.078 - 00:00:14.918, Speaker B: That's weird. That glass looks half full to me.
00:00:14.966 - 00:00:17.358, Speaker A: Eating glass. Eating glass is staring into the abyss.
00:00:17.486 - 00:00:21.714, Speaker B: Glass. Who gives a shit about glass? Who the fuck is this?
00:00:23.094 - 00:00:26.194, Speaker A: It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass.
00:00:27.214 - 00:00:29.554, Speaker B: Gotta get some safety goggles next time.
00:00:38.734 - 00:01:04.160, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, and welcome to chewing glass, the show where we talk to developers building in the Solana ecosystem. Today I have with me Chris Heaney, core contributor to drift protocol. He is, I would consider, a Solana og at this point. Like, I think we. It's been, like, two plus years since we started shitposting back and forth on Twitter together. Uh, so anyways, Chris, uh, welcome to the show. Glad to have you.
00:01:04.160 - 00:01:05.444, Speaker A: How's it going, man?
00:01:06.064 - 00:01:16.004, Speaker B: Gm yeah, it's been a while, um, being in the Solana eco. Happy to be here. Glad I made the cut. And you, uh, well, you've been begging me for a couple of years.
00:01:18.424 - 00:01:54.898, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, we're happy. We're happy to have you on here. So, um, I think. I think everybody on your team at some point reached out to me to ask if you could be on this, on an episode. So I'm glad we're finally here doing this thing. Uh, so the way we normally start out the show is really sort to just get to know, like, um, the Chris before he got into any of this, um, web3 Solana or any of that stuff. So, like, take us back as far as you need to, whether it was in high school or whether, like, you, like, um, in college.
00:01:54.898 - 00:01:58.754, Speaker A: Like, when did you really actually get into just, like, software in general?
00:01:58.914 - 00:02:30.394, Speaker B: So I went to wash u in st. Louis, and I actually studied business. I was, like, taking some math classes and whatnot, but I was doing business, and after my junior year, I had an internship doing management consulting, which is, like, a big career trek for a lot of people. And I did it, and I just, like, had to wear a suit every day and fly from Boston to Houston, like, every week. And I was just doing, like, the most, like, kind of corporate professional type job.
00:02:30.434 - 00:02:31.374, Speaker A: Soul sucking.
00:02:31.834 - 00:03:20.854, Speaker B: Yeah, soul sucking, exactly. And I was also, like, just, like, starting to learn more about entrepreneurship at the same time. I remember I read this book zero to one by Peter Thiel, and he has these lines where he just completely fades consulting and I bankers and I was like, okay, I'm not going to do this. So I went back to school my senior year and I just started taking programming classes. I'm like, all right, I'm going to learn how to build stuff and like, I'm going to be an entrepreneur. And I ended up getting a like kind of a product management role at a startup after school. And just like when I moved out to California and just started doing that job and kept learning to code on the side and after like a year working there, I started working as a full time software developer.
00:03:21.714 - 00:03:35.928, Speaker A: Nice. So when you said you went back to like to take some classes, you were doing that at university or you were like doing some sort of like online stuff or like, like a boot camp or like, how did you, how were you actually learning software?
00:03:36.096 - 00:04:39.263, Speaker B: Yeah. So first I went back to school for my senior year, so instead of like partying and stuff, I was just like maxing out my course load, like taking the maximum amount of classes, just trying to like learn how to program because I hadn't, I had never taken any programming classes. So that was doing your basic Java 101, web development, prototyping, et cetera. And then after I graduated, it was like reading books, trying to build prototypes, all the online courses and stuff. I thought about going and doing a boot camp, but then I just was like, I feel like I know enough that I could get an internship or get a job. So I actually ended up applying for an internship to be a software engineer and I got the internship and then I told my company I was at, I was going to leave to do the internship and they're like, you're crazy. Like, you can, we'll let you do it here basically and trial you out.
00:04:39.263 - 00:04:44.267, Speaker B: So then I snuck into the software engineering team and then I just like kept hustling.
00:04:44.455 - 00:04:55.704, Speaker A: Oh, so you didn't leave? So you didn't leave. They, they just said like, you don't have to do that. You can just, where you were doing the corporate stuff, do you they let you do this on the engineering team there for an internship?
00:04:57.004 - 00:05:07.612, Speaker B: No. Okay. So that internship was my junior year. After school I went to the tech startup, was doing product, and then they let me move over to software engineering at the startup.
00:05:07.708 - 00:05:10.424, Speaker A: What kind of, what kind of product was it?
00:05:11.974 - 00:05:27.154, Speaker B: So we were working on vertical search engines and then we actually were acquired by Amazon and we started working on Alexa. So we were doing like question and answering kind of knowledge based AI stuff.
00:05:27.734 - 00:05:28.022, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:28.038 - 00:05:30.474, Speaker B: So this is like 2017.
00:05:31.134 - 00:05:47.966, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I knew that about you whenever you first came around. I think you even had it in your twitter bio that you were like previously at Amazon trying to like drop the clout and your bio. So when you got, so you got acquired and like, that's how you started working at Amazon essentially.
00:05:48.150 - 00:05:53.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I was at a startup that got bought by Amazon, so I smoked in there too.
00:05:54.454 - 00:06:09.894, Speaker A: What sort of coding stuff were you doing while you were, while you were there? Like what? Like what sort of languages and like what, what sort of stuff are you personally building? I mean, like not the product itself, but the actual sort of, like, what were you, what were you doing?
00:06:10.194 - 00:06:19.134, Speaker B: Yeah, so it started off, I was like working on internal, like Uis, like kind of like the least valuable stuff.
00:06:20.154 - 00:06:27.218, Speaker A: Oh, man, you're going to offend some people. You're going to offend some people who watch this show by saying that, no.
00:06:27.346 - 00:06:47.524, Speaker B: Not trying to fade anyone, but basically they're giving me internal UI bugs to do. Did that for a while. Then they started giving me like Ui stuff that like actual customers would see and then that was all in like JavaScript and it was actually still using like jquery, like, yeah, I'm familiar.
00:06:48.024 - 00:06:49.604, Speaker A: I was a jquery guy.
00:06:50.264 - 00:07:39.544, Speaker B: Yeah. So that was honestly that was hard. And then eventually I started doing more like back end stuff and it was kind of weird because the startup actually used PHP for the backend. So this was like kind of one of those like 2010 startups where they're using like PHP and Ruby. So then I just started writing back end logic and PHP and started adding to our actual question and answering system inside of Alexa. So building APIs inside of how answers were generated. And then by the time I left, I was the engineering lead for this internal team that like did a bunch of kind of question and answer APIs.
00:07:39.544 - 00:07:44.364, Speaker B: Amazon's very like micro services, service oriented architecture.
00:07:44.524 - 00:07:56.784, Speaker A: Right. So before we get too much further, like, did you have any web two, like after Amazon, was there any web two stuff that you were doing at that point in time?
00:07:57.124 - 00:08:41.980, Speaker B: Not really. So when I left, I left Amazon, I was like, I wanted to do a startup. And I was thinking about like actually pairing up with some of my other co workers for Amazon that were leaving at the same time and doing like a SaaS startup or something with like NLP and AI. And just like, nothing was really getting me that excited. Although this was like before the LLM renaissance, so like, I had heard about llms, but they weren't as powerful yet, so it just wasn't that exciting. And once I decided not to do that, I was like, alright, I'm just gonna, I was kind of on the sabbatical just trying to figure out what to do. And that's when I started diving deeper into crypto and just like learning about the development side of it.
00:08:42.132 - 00:09:18.724, Speaker A: So when you were at Amazon or where you're exploring those startups, like, were you, were you the jenning on some crypto, were you like buying and trading? Like what did you know about it like before? Like you go from like Amazon to like exploring some ideas and then thinking about doing some engineering and the blockchain space, there has to be a point. You were just paying attention, somebody pointed it out like you were trading or you saw Ethereum and saw smart contracts existed or what was the whole for you, the aha moment that, hey, this is pretty fucking cool. I might try some stuff over here.
00:09:19.584 - 00:09:57.284, Speaker B: Yeah, basically I'm like part of the COVID class where I was just enjoying my life, doing my thing, living nice California life. And then COVID hit and there was just nothing to do. And so then I was like, all right, I'm gonna build a side app with my friend. And I think we were gonna build a way that people could bet on who would do more steps in a day or something. Something like really dumb. But we were looking into like stripe APIs and we're like, holy shit, costs like whatever they like charge like 3% on every transaction. Like there's no way we can fill this app.
00:09:57.284 - 00:10:33.358, Speaker B: And when we learned about that, we just started like looking into Ethereum and honestly started getting into like that kind of was like, okay, we started researching crypto and at the same time was like the craziness in the stock market. People started freaking out about inflation. So I simultaneously got a bitcoin build a good bit. So kind of on the tech side on Ethereum and then kind of like the intellectual, like I got intel to like the little philosophical rabbit holes with bitcoin. I remember your kept going down when.
00:10:33.406 - 00:10:54.836, Speaker A: You beginning of COVID I've seen your philosophical tweets. Dude, you try really hard. Yeah, no, but that's cool. So, all right, did you know what, like at the time, like before you built a single thing, like what, what exactly were you like thinking? Early stage that you wanted to build on chain.
00:10:55.020 - 00:11:33.844, Speaker B: So like basically that side app that I was talking about just gave up on that once I learned about credit card fees. But then looking into Ethereum, it was like, it was like this whole new world. So then that's kind of when I started getting more excited about crypto development because everything was open sourced and, like, coming from software. And then seeing, like, finance done in a very software developer way, like, open and transparent was just, like, kind of mind blowing. Like, I remember when I learned about ERC 20, and I'm like, this is like an interface for money. Like, this is, like a software interface for money. This is crazy.
00:11:33.844 - 00:11:48.178, Speaker B: So just started learning about a lot of ethereum stuff, and I ended up trying to write, like, a compound liquidator with my friend that was using, like, flash loans to liquidate compound, like, compounds.
00:11:48.226 - 00:11:50.094, Speaker A: Like, the actual, like, protocol.
00:11:51.074 - 00:12:17.154, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. This was probably, like, in the middle of COVID I was like, okay, we're going to build this compound liquidator, and we're going to print money, and we're going to use flash loans to, like, liquidate, like, million dollar size position on compound. And this was before flashbots. So, like, we built it, and then we tried to use it in prod, and we. There was, like, people bidding up Ethereum gas to, like, thousands dollars, and we're like, oh, we can't. We can't compete here.
00:12:17.314 - 00:12:17.818, Speaker A: Did you.
00:12:17.866 - 00:12:19.694, Speaker B: That was, like, my first project.
00:12:20.194 - 00:12:44.954, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, this is always the thing. Like, did you know anything about, like, traditional finance? Like, that. Was that, like, part of your skill set already, or were you, like, you're talking about, like, doing things on. On defi, on the theorem compound? Like, did you know about traditional finance stuff, or did you just, like, sort of research on your own, or you just didn't know anything and you decided to try it?
00:12:45.774 - 00:13:10.250, Speaker B: Personally, I hadn't done any. Like, I've never worked in finance, but the friend that I was working with worked for, like, a HFT company in Chicago, and I have some of my best friends worked in finance, so I feel like I knew a lot of the lingo, and he also was familiar. And so I just, like, I felt like I could pick it up kind of osmosis. Um, but I hadn't worked in HFT or anything.
00:13:10.402 - 00:13:41.038, Speaker A: All right, so, like, let's. Now let's sort of transition a little bit to. To what happened after that. Like, I mean, obviously, eventually, without getting into where you are now and everything that's been done since then, but, like, what was your sort of, like, where'd you find out about, like, Solana? Was it, like, you're trying to do all this, this is not feasible. Let's try it somewhere else. And then you started researching other chains, or did you already. Had you already heard about Solana from somebody else? Like, how did that happen?
00:13:41.206 - 00:14:08.654, Speaker B: Yeah. So I was, I was, I had left Amazon. I was doing, like, my kind of sabbatical. This was like 2021, beginning of 2021. And my friends and I were just, like, kind of doing the, like, early bull market, like, researching everything that exists type phase. And I think one of my friends came across Solana and they're like, this is crazy. Like, it's, you know, saying, I can do 50K TPS.
00:14:08.654 - 00:14:25.602, Speaker B: Like, you should look into this. And then honestly, I just listened to, like, some podcasts with Toli and, like, just started, like, kind of, like, following people on Twitter. Like, some, like, Toly was.
00:14:25.618 - 00:14:33.880, Speaker A: This was in 2020, though, right? This was like, pre, most people knowing about what Solana was. 2020, like late 2020 or something like that.
00:14:33.912 - 00:14:39.524, Speaker B: Maybe it wasn't really 2021. Like probably like February 2021 or something like that.
00:14:39.824 - 00:14:41.804, Speaker A: Started the bull market. Good times.
00:14:43.024 - 00:15:29.770, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. But, yeah, I've somehow started falling, totally started listening to Solana podcasts, and I was like, I don't know, I feel like if you're an engineer and you hear totally talk about things, you just, like, get really excited about the promise of the SVM architecture. So I started getting Solana pilled then and then still was, like, messing around with some solidity development. And then it was like, May 2021, there was a Solana hackathon. I don't remember which one it was. It might have been, like, the second one. And I just heard about it on Twitter, and I was like, okay, I need to do a project, like, end.
00:15:29.802 - 00:15:37.174, Speaker A: To endorial hell and just stop experimenting and just say, I'm going to build this thing and actually fucking build it.
00:15:37.634 - 00:15:56.676, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. The thing with your side projects is you always are starting and never finishing them. So I was like, okay, this is a hackathon. I'm just going to do this hackathon. I'm going to submit it and maybe I'll win. Like, I. And I was like, maybe I could actually win, like, a prize or something, right? And also it's kind of funny.
00:15:56.676 - 00:16:38.724, Speaker B: Like, I was still, like, talking to all my old Amazon co workers and they, like, rust was very, like, in vogue. Like, it was cool to be learning rust. I was like, okay, I'm just gonna, like, learn rust to do this hackathon. And then worst thing that happens is, like, I can, like, tell my co workers I learned rust. So then I just read the rust book and then built a prototype of a binary option protocol on Solana deployed on Devnet. Pith had just launched. So I integrated with pith and, yeah, did it really quick and finished the hackathon, and then that was my intro to Solana development.
00:16:38.884 - 00:16:42.524, Speaker A: You lost the hackathon, though, right? Just to be clear, I didn't even.
00:16:42.564 - 00:16:45.436, Speaker B: Place, like, we'll blame Matt.
00:16:45.540 - 00:16:49.784, Speaker A: We'll blame Matty Tay for that. Matt Taylor, like, why did you not see this?
00:16:50.724 - 00:17:18.512, Speaker B: Well, I think the issue is I didn't have any, like, Twitter exposure or anything. I know that's, like, like, half of the half of the thing, but, uh, yeah, like, uh, it was super cool. And then I think that's when we first started talking. I was, like, trying to. I kind of remember I was, like, trying to deploy my thing to Devnet. And then you're like, you were still manning the salon of discord then and helped me.
00:17:18.648 - 00:17:57.812, Speaker A: Okay, so after that, you were in, like, obviously there was no information. Like, the core documentation was sort of just, like, big, massive paragraphs, and, like, didn't really teach you how to build the core. Engineers were telling everybody, just go read the tests if you want to know how to build on Solana. This was, like, pre Solana cookbook and a lot of the resources that we have today. So I guess you were just asking questions in discord, and you just did most of this stuff on your own. What did you use? What were your resources for being able to. Because rust is obviously just rust.
00:17:57.812 - 00:18:01.584, Speaker A: That's nothing to do with actually building a protocol in Solana.
00:18:02.564 - 00:18:38.744, Speaker B: Yeah, that was a good question. Okay, so I think I first, I started with Paul X's tutorial, classic, the classic Bible. I read that. I was super confused, but I was going through it, and I was like, okay, I kind of get it. And then I was trying to write a native Solana program, and I was doing all the annoying, like, serialization, deserialization things, and I was like, this is so painful. And then, like, I found out about anchor. I swear, it was like, anchor 0.6
00:18:38.744 - 00:19:02.662, Speaker B: or something, or five or four. It was early found out about anchor, and, like, anchor had some, like, example programs. And when I found about. When I found out about anchor is like, okay, this is. This is doable. And there is like, yeah, some examples. And I was able to piece together how to do simple, like, send transactions, update the state of your program, etcetera, write test.
00:19:02.662 - 00:19:19.302, Speaker B: So once I found anchor is kind of like, I'm off to the races. Like, I can. I don't have to do all, like, a lot of the glass chewing was, like, reduced, at least to get started. So I don't know if I would have made it if anchor wasn't there, probably given up on.
00:19:19.438 - 00:19:29.672, Speaker A: I mean, I think that's. That's the case for. For a lot of people. So that was like a savior. So shout out to Armani for. For just building that. Just.
00:19:29.672 - 00:19:49.884, Speaker A: I think he, like, his thing was like, he built it for himself initially because he was like, I don't want to deal with this every single time. So it was. It was. I don't even know if it was a ten x or a hundred x, like, improvement for the experience, but I know it was substantial for most people trying to get into Solana.
00:19:51.544 - 00:20:16.374, Speaker B: Yeah. Just, I feel like you need to, like, with anchor, you could be pretty noobish with rust to start and get something working without anchor, you have to, like, kind of know what's going on in rust. Right. So I think it definitely lowers the barrier to getting in the door. And then once you get things working end to end, you can, like, learn more about all the specifics.
00:20:16.914 - 00:20:37.932, Speaker A: All right, so anchor was your savior. Maybe give you some hope. Like, let's sort of, like, what was the next. What happened after that for you? I know that you guys, like, like, I don't know if there was anything in between, like, your next hackathon for Solana or, like, how that all went. How that all happened.
00:20:38.068 - 00:21:21.472, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I did that hackathon, and, like, I had, like, a small twitter. I posted it on Twitter, and somehow, like, it got picked up by, like, the Solana ecosystem. A lot of people started retweeting it, and I just was, like, between doing the hackathon and just, like, seeing the reception online, and I just got, like, super excited. And basically, it was so early that, because I did that hackathon, a lot of people started reaching out to me on Twitter. Like, hey, can you come work with me? Like, I need someone to help build out, like, smart contracts. And, like, even though I was, like, a noob, I was like, there's no one around. So that was.
00:21:21.528 - 00:21:26.524, Speaker A: Those were the times, man. Like, if you just barely knew anything about Solana, like, you were in high demand.
00:21:27.904 - 00:21:39.904, Speaker B: Yeah. So it was that time. And so I did the hackathon, and then everyone was reaching out. And then I heard about, basically, drift was originally called Moe.
00:21:40.024 - 00:21:45.404, Speaker A: I was about to. I was about to call that out. Like, yeah, moe finance. Classic.
00:21:45.744 - 00:22:01.152, Speaker B: Yeah. So it was still coming away then. We're looking for. We need a developer. Like, you know, like, someone to come help build this thing. And I reached out to them and, you know, met the rest of the team, and who was it?
00:22:01.168 - 00:22:04.120, Speaker A: At the time it was just David and Cindy.
00:22:04.272 - 00:22:15.584, Speaker B: It was David, Cindy and Big Z was. Oh, yeah, that's, that was it. And I flew out to New York, met them and was like, all right, let's rip.
00:22:16.204 - 00:22:22.772, Speaker A: So did you guys, did you guys submit that to the moab? Was that submitted to a hackathon or am I just like, misremembering?
00:22:22.868 - 00:22:31.344, Speaker B: No, no, there is no hackathon. I mean, I did that. I did my own hackathon and then they were already starting and then I just joined forces.
00:22:32.004 - 00:22:47.584, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember, I remember you had reached out and I got on a call with like, all three of you guys sometime when you were like, early stage in New York and you were like, looking for more developers. I don't remember if I, I was actually able to help you find anybody or not, but I tried at least I think.
00:22:48.124 - 00:23:01.584, Speaker B: No, actual, funny. You had this list of developers who had reached out and I was like, I was just reaching out to all of them. And the first UI contributor that we had came from that list.
00:23:02.804 - 00:23:24.544, Speaker A: Yeah, I just shout out to Luke, I had no idea what I was doing at that time, so I just kept collecting names of people that wanted to build on Solana and I just started passing it around to every team that come out to me. So I'm glad to hear that that really manual, shitty version of the early days of hiring and Solana actually did something at some point.
00:23:25.164 - 00:23:41.672, Speaker B: No, that, that was crucial. Like a crucial team member still working on drift. So, yeah, when you're early, you just, you just make it up on the fly and it's honestly just grit to get to the next phase. Right?
00:23:41.768 - 00:24:00.764, Speaker A: Well, yeah, man. So let's, let's. Now that we've sort of like, seen this whole journey, like, let's talk a little bit about drift and like, that whole, like, just build, like, what is drift and, and what it was like and what you had actually built in those early days with the protocol.
00:24:01.224 - 00:24:39.834, Speaker B: Yeah. So drift is decentralized trading protocol features both spot and derivatives trading. At this point, it basically aims to be almost a DeFi super app. So you can do borrow, lend, you can trade. There's passive trading strategies, active trading strategies you can do. It's like, it's really trying to compete with binance or Coinbase and put everything on chain, trying to utilize the fact that Solana supports being able to do everything in one place. Yeah, when we first got started, it was way simpler.
00:24:39.834 - 00:25:14.854, Speaker B: The first version of the protocol went live was just purely derivatives trading. All it had was market orders. So if you know, like, in trading, like, that's literally the simplest thing possible. It only featured one single amm that people could trade against. Was super simple. And, yeah, over the last two years, just have layered on functionality kind of in concentric circles over time. And now it's like full featured Dex.
00:25:14.854 - 00:25:22.058, Speaker B: A lot of users really like it because it kind of has kind of, you can do everything there pretty much now.
00:25:22.186 - 00:25:37.654, Speaker A: Well, I know you guys are on your version, too, so, like, what was the sort of big shift and changes and, like, features or whatever going, like, what would you like? If you could, like, condense it down, what would you call V one versus V two?
00:25:38.114 - 00:26:42.724, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say V two really focused on risk, safety, reliability, and also scalability. So for the scalability piece, like, first starting working on Solana, don't really. Don't deeply understand how it works. I can get something working, but in terms of how do I structure the accounts, how do I make sure there's no write locks? All this stuff does not have that. So V two took a lot of the learnings about how to write a scalable Solana program and baked it in, and then also just learnings from having a protocol live on mainnet doing lots of volume. How do you build a safe, how do you build a safe defi protocol, accounting for, like, volatility, et cetera, that all got baked in. So both from just like, pure tech and then also kind of more the economic perspective, just putting in those, like, learnings from v one into v two.
00:26:43.144 - 00:27:14.516, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah, I mean, like, it sounds, at least from what I've seen lately, you guys are doing pretty well. You guys, like, have a lot of activity going on, and so it's good to see teams stick it out for. For so long and just continue to build, because that's not the case for everybody. You know, there's been a lot of drop off, not just on Solana, but, like, on Ethereum. You know, not everybody makes it and is able to get to the place where you guys have and stick around as long as you have. So there's a huge props for that.
00:27:14.660 - 00:28:00.344, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's not easy. You definitely always sometimes wonder if, well, there's the one, there's the big fork in your life where I'm working crypto, and then there's this other four where, like, I'm gonna learn a lot about Solana, so definitely take some faith. But I think the good thing about being an insider is you see things getting better and you can remember what they used to be like. So with Solana, for example, like, it's that the network itself has gotten way, way better. So even if people outside of the ecosystem are questioning it, when you see how much better it's gotten, how many people are committed to it makes it easy to be confident about the future.
00:28:00.504 - 00:28:35.356, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sure your job wasn't easy. I always like to be honest about this. We had some dark days in 2022, some very dark days. And fuck, all those liquidator bots that tried it just would not let the network, like, get its traction back. But then came the NFT bots and, like, now we're, like, in such a great place. My anxiety levels have reduced back down to normal levels, which are still pretty high anxiety in general, but so that's awesome, man. Like, yeah, that's like defi protocols.
00:28:35.356 - 00:28:55.104, Speaker A: And everybody at the time was building through a very tumultuous time for, like, network growth and all these things. So those local fee markets and quic and all those things have. It's. It's been incredible to see that. And I'm sure it's helpful for you guys to not have to worry too much about that, at least as of late.
00:28:56.204 - 00:29:06.388, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like night and day. Honestly, the network right now is like, at its current demand level for like, whatever it can do. It's like just humming.
00:29:06.516 - 00:29:07.864, Speaker A: Knock on wood, please.
00:29:10.764 - 00:29:22.372, Speaker B: We'll see in the bull market of demand, like Ten X's. But right now it's, yeah, it's, it's working, which really, you know, kudos to the core team for just like, hunkering.
00:29:22.428 - 00:29:40.144, Speaker A: Down and, and the validators and also, and also, like, the, the protocol developers who are also contributing to core and all the different people, man. Like, it, it does literally takes a village to make this work. This would never have just worked with a small core group of people. It just never would have happened.
00:29:41.044 - 00:29:59.184, Speaker B: Yeah, it's crazy. It's fun to be a part of. It's like, it's kind of like a little network state. You know, there's so many teams all over the world just helping, contributing. Like, it's super fun to be a part of, even with the ups and downs.
00:29:59.524 - 00:30:46.984, Speaker A: So moving on from all that, like, we, the sort of last segment of this, I always like to ask couple questions. And one like, so you've been building on Solana for two plus years now. You've seen the early days of just complete glass chewing. And, like, there's still some of that for people that are sort of like, pushing the boundaries and innovating, but there are a lot of tools out there now that have added some improvements. So with that said, what still sucks for you the most about building on Solana? Like, what's like the most, like, painful thing that you have to do every day whenever you're coding? That could be improved on and even make a recommendation on how that could be improved if you have any.
00:30:47.604 - 00:31:51.662, Speaker B: Honestly, I think a lot of it is just kind of like the off chain piece of, like, okay, now that you have users, like, drift has whatever in the hundreds of daily active users, but there's a lot of transactions going through, like, drift right now does about a million transactions a day. Just like, indexing all that data, making it easily, like, retrievable for, like, your average user, making sure all the bots off chain have access to, like, up to date, like, on chain state. All that stuff, I think takes up a lot of our team's time and then definitely, like, trying to prepare for if so, on defi ten xs and our daily active users go up making sure all that scales really seamlessly. So I think it's more at the RPC off chain layer of getting that next layer of growth or next level of growth is what we spend a lot of our time thinking about.
00:31:51.838 - 00:32:31.244, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And, I mean, everybody's thinking about this, and hopefully whatever they decide and whatever is designed is open source, so everybody cannot have to hand roll their own shit, because this is one of the things, one of the things that comes up often is we've had people talk to us about logging and how everybody does it, and we're like, I think everybody just does it their own way and they just suffer through it. And they don't really do much logging, at least in a way that it's easily understandable. And if you do do that, you would have to basically build something from the ground up yourself to be able to track a lot of that.
00:32:31.584 - 00:33:16.384, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, if you're just writing like, a smart contract, really simple, like, you can, it's not too hard with anchor. It's really like, yeah, all the stuff off chain to make an end to end app. And I think, I think there's, now, there's a lot of projects that, like, have examples. Like, how do you, like, listen to, you know, logs from a program like drift. Drift, the way drift does that is open source and stuff. Um, it's really just like, keep making it cheaper and easier and reliable, um, which is just like a lot of sweat and tears and I know, like, trident and helios. Like, are in a working group to make the RPC's better, and a lot of people are working on it.
00:33:16.384 - 00:33:24.508, Speaker B: But, um, yeah, that's kind of like the next big thing is just making sure it keeps working as there's way, way more users.
00:33:24.676 - 00:33:42.340, Speaker A: What's the, what's your guys, GitHub repo or what's your guys, GitHub.org called just for everybody listening here, because like, we hear a lot about like, drift having a really great open source. So what's the there? Or what's the handle?
00:33:42.412 - 00:34:18.364, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're drift dash Labs protocol V two is like the main v two repo and also has SDK in there. So if you go through the SDK, there's a lot of cool things to learn in there, like listening to logs or doing retry for transaction sending, etcetera. Then there's some other repos that are integrated with drift. So if you want to learn how to do composing between programs that could be useful are generally always like kind of open sourcing new stuff.
00:34:19.544 - 00:35:12.112, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the interesting part, is like a lot of people are still coming into blockchain or Solana or whatever and thinking like, I gotta learn rust, I gotta go there from the beginning. And they don't realize that there's like SDKs for Defi protocols, there's SDKs for payments, there's SDKs for gaming. There's like, you could literally build an entire business on Solana without ever touching a smart contract. Well, you would have to write code that communicated with a smart contract, but not necessarily write one yourself. You could come there, just build with the drift SDK, and that's your introduction to building on blockchain without actually having to do that behind the scenes work enough to just understand it, get a feel for it, and then you can incrementally work your way from there. I think that's just one thing that we don't talk about a lot. You don't have to be a smart contract developer to build on blockchain, especially Solana.
00:35:12.112 - 00:35:20.480, Speaker A: There's enough abstractions and SDKs out there now that you could be, you could just use typescript for the rest of your life and still build really cool shit on Solana.
00:35:20.672 - 00:35:43.994, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I think even a good way to get started is like, find projects you like, hopefully, like drift, go into their discord. And like, we have, we have example bots that you can run and like, you can. There's example liquidator bots. So similar to how I did the liquidator for compound. You can do a liquidator for drift. And then you can start learning about how these systems work.
00:35:43.994 - 00:35:50.438, Speaker B: And then if you like that, you can keep going layers deeper, or you could stay at that level of abstraction.
00:35:50.606 - 00:36:10.084, Speaker A: All right, so now we did what. What sucks or what's more challenging? But, like, so, like, what's what. What is for you? Like, what's good about building on Solana? It doesn't necessarily have to be the. On, like, the, the coding side, but it can be, it can be anything. Like what? Like, for you, is like, the reason you're here, the reason you build on Solana. Like, what makes your life easier.
00:36:10.624 - 00:36:50.894, Speaker B: I think, actually there's a great developer community that Solana has. There's actually a lot of open source examples that, like, when I got started, I learned from serum, I learned from mango. There's a lot of good open source examples. I think Drift's up there now, and there's a lot of other good projects, too. So you can come in and you can kind of read how the top projects are doing things and, like, learn really fast. And then the discords, people are always friendly. If you go in there and ask questions, like, the core contributors will generally always answer your questions, help you out, and then even on Twitter, that's very entertaining and a lot of fun.
00:36:50.894 - 00:37:15.142, Speaker B: So I'm definitely really bullish on the Solana developer ecosystem. And I think, I mean, that's, that's a lot of the reason why, like, Solana's, like, gonna do well is because people just, like, people enjoy working together and, like, building together, which is, like, obviously upstream of a lot of, like, good products being built.
00:37:15.318 - 00:37:52.386, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you're not the first person to say that. It's like, it's just like, TL doctor just, like, came for this tech stayed for the vibes sort of mentality. And, like, it really is like, you, you'll get any of the smartest people, um, in this, in the Solana ecosystem, answering your questions on Twitter. If you ask it, totally will answer your question, but you probably won't understand the answer because I rarely do. Uh, but, um, yeah, so final, final thing, um, here is sort of like, imagine you're this new developer looking to. You're like you were web two. Like, maybe you're interested in web3.
00:37:52.386 - 00:38:16.784, Speaker A: Like, what sort of advice would you give to, like, either maybe why you would come here or how you would get started, or just, like, general advice to somebody who's, like, on the, on the sort of edge of being, or just getting already had just gotten started. Like, what advice would you give that person for them to sort of really actually take it to the next level or get sort of embedded in the Solana ecosystem?
00:38:17.404 - 00:39:13.084, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. I would just try to find a project that you like for whatever reason, whether you like the product or the contributors, et cetera, and just like, go participate in their dev community, like, for drift. That would be running like a liquidator or one of our keeper bots, and just learn how to be a part of that, upgrading it, maybe you fork it, tweak it, make it more competitive, start learning the tech stack, and from there you can pick a lot of directions to go deeper. But I think a good way to get started is to, like, have something fun to do. You know, don't, like, read docs constantly and, like, kind of have a lot of information, but not feel like you're, like, in the mix doing things. So, like, find a side, like, find a project and, like, contribute to it is a good way to go. And then from there, it'll open a lot of doors.
00:39:13.244 - 00:40:06.454, Speaker A: I mean, I think that's really good advice. Like, it's number one. I think, for me has always been just like, what are you interested in? Is it finance? Is it gaming? Is it payments? Like, what is your vertical of choice? Go find that community of people that are building those similar things and join, like you said, join their discord community. Just nobody likes sitting around reading docs and building and their own without being able. That's the quickest way to just, like, not complete what you're doing. Like working in a silo, you know, like some people do like that. It's not, but, like, having that interaction to, like, bounce your ideas off people and having people there to answer those questions and, like, help you along the way and, and then eventually you'll be able to give that back to somebody else one day, which is like, I think one of the things that you see in Solana a lot people that get help early on and throughout their sort of journey eventually will give back.
00:40:06.454 - 00:40:31.154, Speaker A: I'll reach out to somebody and be like, hey, we need somebody to do a workshop for one of these boot camps we're doing. They want to focus on X, Y and Z. Everybody's always just in. The ecosystem is just quick to jump into that and be like, sure, I'm happy to do that. So just the, the willingness to share information, you just got to find your, your, um, like, your crew and your vertical and, and just go from there. So I think it's really good advice.
00:40:31.454 - 00:41:20.370, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like, cliche that, like, web3 is about community, but if you think about it versus, like, your normal tech company, like, how easy it is is it to go talk to, like, the lead developers from a web two startup? It's actually like, how would you even talk to them? I think it's hard where in web3 is, like, kind of expectation that you can just go hop in discord and ask some questions and they're going to respond to you. Like, that's super cool that you have this direct line of communication and it's encouraged and, yeah, make the most out of it. Like, I personally love when people come in the drift protocol discord, and they're like, hey, how do I do this? I'm like, okay, let me. Let me teach you. Like, I love that you're, like, contributing to this, like, like, this tech stack, so. And I think a lot of people in the web3 crypto space feel similarly.
00:41:20.522 - 00:41:42.694, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. All right, Chris. Well, that's about it for. For the call. Finally got you on here after about two years of asking. And I'm glad you reached out to me, like, recently and reminded me. So great to have you here and thanks for joining, and I'll check you later, man.
00:41:43.594 - 00:41:46.074, Speaker B: Yep. Thanks for having me. All right, peace. Cheers.
