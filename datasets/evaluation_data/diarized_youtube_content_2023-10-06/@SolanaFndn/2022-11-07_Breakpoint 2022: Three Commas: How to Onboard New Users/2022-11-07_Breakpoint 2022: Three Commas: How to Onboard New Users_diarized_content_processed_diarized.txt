00:00:06.680 - 00:00:43.194, Speaker A: So awesome to be here with you all. I am Dana from Solana foundation in university relations. So, obviously, onboarding new users is very important to me, and I am super excited to be joined by these gigabrains and ogs today. Andrew from Republic Crypto, Prakash from Chingari, Sinlin from web3, Auth, and Trevor from Stepn. And we're going to jam about what it would look like to onboard a billion new users and if we can even do it. So I wanted to start by asking you guys to kind of introduce yourselves through your own red pill experience. Who onboarded you and what did that look like? Anybody want to take it first?
00:00:43.894 - 00:01:07.764, Speaker B: Yeah. So, hi, nice to see you all here today. I'm Trevor. I work as head of business development for Stepn, and the first time I got involved with crypto, I bought a one bitcoin back in 2014. Fortunately, I didn't hold it too long, and then I was kind of in and out through some of, like, the bull and bear cycles since then.
00:01:09.584 - 00:01:24.564, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Sin Lin. The first time I got into web3 was when my friend introduced me about the existence of extension, which as a mainstream user, I would not know that existed. That's where I got my first wallet and never looked back. Then.
00:01:26.944 - 00:01:57.304, Speaker D: I'm Prakash. So my redfill kind of goes a very mixed way. So, until 2015, I was like a medical doctor, but I wanted to double down on tech, like you wanted to be one to one to me, many than one to one. So it wasn't until 2019 that I could actually build products out of crypto. Crypto. So that's when my initial Red Bull moment started. And later on, in two thousand twenty s, I think I found the non evms a bit more really challenging to explore R and D.
00:01:57.304 - 00:02:03.364, Speaker D: And, yeah, I think that's when my double learning on Solana architecture kind of began. And before joining Chingari.
00:02:04.344 - 00:02:31.497, Speaker E: Hi, I'm Andrew Durgi. I'm head of Republic crypto. I have a little different version. I think everyone else, it was red, pulled by an engineering buddy of mine who read Satoshi's white paper in 2009, December 2009. He found it in an anti government libertarian IRC chat. And by early February in 2010, we had a pretty aggressive mining operation running. So we were off to the races at that point.
00:02:31.625 - 00:02:53.074, Speaker A: That's wild. I mean, I discovered we talked a bit backstage, obviously, and I found this out. One of the questions I was going to ask you all, and I am going to ask you, is there one resource that you wish you had found earlier, that would have changed the game in terms of your onboarding experience. And Andrew answered that with me. He's like, well, I started with the white paper. I'm like, oh, but if anybody else wants to jump in on something that has.
00:02:53.894 - 00:03:35.984, Speaker B: Yeah, that's, that's a great question. Actually, I was thinking of one resource that's been incredible and what has brought everybody here, meeting everybody at crypto conferences and networking events. So I was gonna say one resource was probably networking events and, like, seeing and meeting people who are actually working in the industry. Like, when I just, like, traded one bitcoin and then I kind of got involved or some tokens was really abstract and, like, you know, I didn't know, like, who was behind the scenes. Like, why are people building in this, in this industry and what's going on? So when I started really going to Solana hacker houses earlier this year, I was like, wow, there's some really incredible people building in, you know, in crypto and the industry as a whole.
00:03:36.964 - 00:03:52.344, Speaker C: Yep. So for me, I think it's more about also the community. That's why many daos exist. And people, like, reach out to the younger crowd from the university to onboard them. I think exposure and the community really helps to bring people on.
00:03:53.084 - 00:04:13.992, Speaker D: Yeah. And I think adding to Andrew's answer, it's hard to be more og than that. But apart from that, I think for me, I would like to have seen more crypto conferences. Hacker House is oriented. I think that's something Solana has done really well. So, yeah, I think that kind of resource where you can learn from a very basic point of view, that's how you can encourage more builders to come to the scene as well.
00:04:14.048 - 00:04:25.764, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's get into something like a little deeper. A billion users. How are we going to do it? What's the app that's going to push it over? What is it? And if it happens, can we actually handle it?
00:04:27.264 - 00:05:03.150, Speaker E: Yeah, I can jump into that first. I mean, the reality is no one can handle a billion users. You can take all the existing blockchains across the board, and they wouldn't be able to handle a billion users of transaction. But, I mean, I think the goal is about looking forward. And we, at least on the republic crypto side, we continually look at infrastructure. There's plenty of app products that are coming out that are proof of concept, that are kind of pushing the envelope forward, but the infrastructure is not there. From a custodial standpoint, from a legal standpoint, from technology standpoint, it won't really, really matter.
00:05:03.150 - 00:05:12.246, Speaker E: And I think that's really the opportunity in this room, is who can continue to build the infrastructure that allows this thing to actually get to where it can handle a billion users.
00:05:12.310 - 00:06:02.294, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I was going to add to that. We were talking about this a little bit, is even when stepping at. When I started playing 30,000 daily active users, the experience was incredibly different. As soon as they started to ramp up to reaching the peak of 1 million daily active users, and, I mean, everything broke in the app, on the backend, on the front end. There were web two infrastructure problems of scaling up your AWS service or handling throughput for just all the runs. But there are also major web3 infrastructure demands that we were not ready for. Handling all of the token swaps from our custodial wallet to non custodial wallet, and it would have delays.
00:06:02.294 - 00:06:06.794, Speaker B: People would be submitting thousands of customer service tickets a day. It was madness.
00:06:08.334 - 00:06:20.086, Speaker E: Gari's got 30 million plus active users at this point, so they're one of the larger, especially on the Solana ecosystem. And you can even talk about how difficult it is to manage that.
00:06:20.150 - 00:06:36.216, Speaker D: Of course. Yeah, I think add on to that. So when I joined, we had around 200k active on chain users. So right now, it's close to like 1.5 million wallets activated. So there's at least, like, there's at least at one point or ten they onboarded with an on chain element. I think that's the biggest success stories.
00:06:36.216 - 00:06:55.604, Speaker D: We can say that, but I think the answer to the previous question is also that I think we need to also think about. The ideal way to onboarding is having, like, a web two front end and a crypto backend. So the user should not even bother about what blockchain they're on. And I think that's the key to kind of making very frictionless as much as possible.
00:06:56.384 - 00:07:07.032, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes me think, like, what's the difference between onboarding web two and web3? What's the difference? I guess you're really in the design kind of some of these things. So you want to jump in on that.
00:07:07.128 - 00:07:31.054, Speaker C: Yep. So based on what the three gentlemen mentioned just now, it brings. It's a good summary of, like, we often think that users are not ready for web3, but actually web3 might not be ready for users based on infrastructure or design. And the differences between onboarding web two users and web3 users is web3 users. They're all about simplicity, everything within one click. Web three users. They're more privacy, data security focused.
00:07:31.054 - 00:07:39.354, Speaker C: Then you got to ensure that, hey, this is secure. You got to give them the trust. So it's all about simplicity for web two and then trust for web two users.
00:07:41.594 - 00:07:51.214, Speaker A: Awesome. So how much do we actually know about the users that we're onboarding, and how much do we want to know? And I have another what do we want them to do once they're onboarded?
00:07:51.874 - 00:08:17.474, Speaker C: Exactly, because everyone talks about onboarding the next billion users. But exactly who are these billion users? Are they the existing ones they're on, for example, the platforms that they are already using, or are they the underserved, the unbanked that could benefit from web3? This is a question that founders or app developers have to find out and match and better meet the goals of their users to scale.
00:08:18.974 - 00:09:28.410, Speaker E: I think Gamefi is probably an area where you're going to see it the most. It's one of the more retail, easily translatable pieces. And we're probably most likely in Asia, almost certainly the Korea blockchain this past year. And, I mean, you're talking about an entire nation that's already pretty much desensitized to the onboarding process into digital assets, even outside of crypto, just the regular existence. So there's a huge opportunity there. And with the recent kind of fall down of like terra Luna, which really kind of ran Korea and kind of held it out for the rest of the protocols, now there's a huge opportunity for the protocols to kind of other protocols to enter that space. And all these Gamefi projects are trying to find places where they can land, you know, where other areas, too, where the jurisdictions legally are a lot more difficult to onboard, like us, is very, very, very difficult to onboard for Gamefi, where Korea is becoming more and more open to that, not only from a legal jurisdiction standpoint, but also all the other components of it.
00:09:28.410 - 00:09:46.934, Speaker E: So I really would be looking to Asia as the first place we're going to see mass adoption. I think Gamefi is, again, something that's very tangible. You can abscond the blockchain layer relatively easily, I think, in gaming as well. So there's a lot of opportunity there. If you guys didn't have an opportunity to go to the games day here on Friday, it was unbelievable.
00:09:47.354 - 00:09:53.922, Speaker A: Super fun, super lit. Yeah, that's the energy. Just amazing. It's like community.
00:09:54.018 - 00:10:10.394, Speaker E: A billion users has to come from the retail side. Republic crypto is unique because we kind of sit the inflection point of retail and institutions. So we kind of touch both. And if you want on board billionaires, it's going to be retail users. Right. So where are those retail users going to be? Probably not on the investment side. Right.
00:10:10.394 - 00:10:22.210, Speaker E: That's like, not interesting to most people. So it's going to be something on the entertainment side. So maybe that's ticketing or events, gaming. That's where it's going to sit.
00:10:22.282 - 00:10:28.314, Speaker A: Yeah. Or things like Chingari, too, where you've got, like, if you, you want to talk about how community plays a role in onboarding.
00:10:28.474 - 00:11:02.650, Speaker D: Definitely. I think one of the biggest mistakes we often do is trying to differentiate between web two and web3 users. So when it comes to new users, it's just to make it as easy for them as much as possible. And of course, you have to understand that onboarding not, has to be web3 native all the time. So you have to make them comfortable, infuse elements, especially engineering, with product design as well. It's very much relevant, like how she's also been there. And I think if you have to really club them in together, and I think they'll be able to give you the real value and answers to you as well.
00:11:02.650 - 00:11:19.014, Speaker D: So when you manage the community, they're able to give you the crucial insights. So I think community gives us half the answers because as a firm, we can build three brilliant products in a year, but we also want to involve with community involved in terms of giving us crucial insights, how we can make it better for the users as well.
00:11:19.954 - 00:11:22.890, Speaker E: What's step in's geographical demographics?
00:11:23.082 - 00:12:37.754, Speaker B: Yeah, so I was going to say games are definitely where I would say, see a ton of potential for onboarding from the web two industry to web3. Right. And for Stepn, we have a very global, diverse user base. And so several countries of the world, we have huge, like french communities, we have huge Korea communities, in Australia, where we're founded, and also the US. And so I would say in terms of, you know, gaming and kind of, it's important, I think, to consider what products or companies that can engage web two users in a way that hasn't been done before with maybe a familiar experience, but it has a lot of crypto behind the scenes and also teaches them a lot about onboarding. And so a step in earlier this year, we saw, you know, you introduced this game that kind of have these NFTs, and it's really different from your familiar experience of, like, you know, 10,000 PFP NFT project. Right.
00:12:37.754 - 00:13:11.236, Speaker B: And I think the real potential would be with projects maybe similar games like Stepn, where you can open up the door to thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands and millions of users with a way to engage them with NFTs that haven't been done before. So the way we have our NFT set up, you can actually mint more sneakers. You know, it's unlimited. So you can keep going and continue sort of sharing this experience with more community members. Yeah.
00:13:11.340 - 00:13:21.076, Speaker E: Without everyone having to sign an NDA. Like, where are the target markets for you guys coming into 2023? Yeah, I know this is your panel, but I have my own question because.
00:13:21.100 - 00:13:23.772, Speaker A: It was so much more fun when we're all just talking like, you know.
00:13:23.948 - 00:13:52.048, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a great question. So for 2023, we. So we had some major partnerships we're really excited about this year. So earlier we had our initial game offering on binance with AsICs back in May, which was an incredible experience. Our first major web two partnership for Stepn, which I think really touched on. Right. We have this unique game with NFTs that really hasn't been done before.
00:13:52.048 - 00:15:01.440, Speaker B: But I think what was really key, key and crucial to forming this partnership is becoming a partner with a web two brand that's familiar with a user base that we're really trying to target in web3, fitness and lifestyle. So when we saw Asics, people were basically going crazy, like they were looking for some more familiar brand to kind of take the first step, step into web3 with us. And then recently we actually had another partnership to do a Cobra NFT with Atletico de Madrid. So now we're really getting in touch with some of the major soccer fans who maybe were playing the game and some of the other users in Europe. And so actually, one of the next major areas that I would love to target. I mean, I'm a little biased because I live in the US, but I would love to see, like a major, you know, partner with a major marathon association, let's say, or some sports association sports, another sportswear brand or New York.
00:15:01.472 - 00:15:03.088, Speaker E: Marathon was what, yesterday, right?
00:15:03.216 - 00:15:47.998, Speaker B: Yeah. Yes. We had a, we had an expo, we had a booth at the New York City Marathon. So we're starting to just like, get in front over there and start to mingle with them, which is really awesome. But, you know, hopefully we can look to kind of really deliver the web3 experience of doing some fun co branded NFT, let's say, or something else, even maybe in person community events. We've seen real success from a community perspective with all of our offline events where all of people from different countries and different cities in the world get together and go show everybody their sneakers, their stuff at sneakers, and they hang out and do some run at the same time. So we're really looking to do more of that as well.
00:15:48.086 - 00:16:11.334, Speaker E: I think Trevor's really touching on a good point. The reality is that that type of onboarding is not going to come natively from a web3 company. Right. It's going to come in collaboration with large web two companies that already have mass distribution abilities. The Instagram announcement the other day for digital collectibles, they're calling them nfTs. I think they call them digital collectibles is a good example of that. And I think that's kind of just the tip of the iceberg.
00:16:11.334 - 00:16:24.158, Speaker E: So when you guys are building out your web3 products, I would be very cognizant of who the right web two partners are for you to help increase your distribution and access to that potential three, comma, billion users.
00:16:24.286 - 00:16:38.470, Speaker A: Absolutely. When we saw the OK bears and Air Jordan do this, they did a high school basketball game and it's just an amazing way to see people activate it. It's really exciting. I agree with that sort of web, too. To Web three bridge, for sure.
00:16:38.582 - 00:17:13.704, Speaker B: Yeah. And also to Simlin's point earlier is there's going to be, we're going to need, there's going to be a demand, right? Like we're going to have to be ready to prepare infrastructure for this familiar user experience. Like, even with Stepn, it's pretty easy to register for the app and things like this, but it's the first time they're creating a wallet. They have so many questions, what do I swap here? Like, how do I do this, how do I do that? And I don't think we're there yet where it's just turnkey for somebody to just dive right in.
00:17:14.284 - 00:17:15.744, Speaker A: How far away are we?
00:17:16.684 - 00:17:40.674, Speaker B: I don't think we're there at all yet. We just started. We're just getting to the tip of the iceberg. Stepn, I think, has, like I said, we reached some million dau, but that's not going to take us to a billion yet. And there are major, major challenges to even break into like the next ten x for our users as well.
00:17:40.714 - 00:17:40.938, Speaker E: Right.
00:17:40.986 - 00:18:12.974, Speaker B: Both infrastructure and creating maybe like a sustainable game as well for that growth, which is very tough. And I was going to point out as well, I think it really is going to be another familiar app or something that takes the industry by store. We'll see it time and time again. I think social apps have really great potential. Like maybe even like a WeChat, but of web3, something like this, especially in the future.
00:18:13.594 - 00:18:49.082, Speaker D: Yeah. Just to add on to that, I think the ideal onboarding process as well. So if you need to decide, like if you, the users need not go through the seed phrases aspect, I think you should totally do it. So that's where firms like Vectreau are very crucial in that phase. And of course, and as builders also, we need to take a step back and how do you make it for users to onboard? Right. So not a lot of times we kind of always think about web3 native users and we don't really the ideal way to red pill companies to actually take the route, like make it easier for onboarding. And even a couple of weeks back, Chase was tweeting the elephant in the room that we don't have users in crypto.
00:18:49.082 - 00:19:14.174, Speaker D: Well, hello. That's because you're not a chinkari. So I think you have to use, of course, the middle layer of middleware of apps that are going to be very crucial to onboard new users. So I think often we should always take that experimental step back and see how can you make it really useful for the users to onboard as well. And that's where the community also plays a big time in bringing them and red billing the entire community as well.
00:19:14.474 - 00:19:36.556, Speaker E: When we're talking about a billion users, you're talking about commercial liability, right? And we're just not there yet. Right. And to make something commercially viable, especially from a data transfer technology. And that's what we're talking about. That's what this is, right? That's what blockchain is really data transfer. It takes humans about 20 to 30 years. You had radio, came out in 1889.
00:19:36.556 - 00:20:13.536, Speaker E: It wasn't commercially viable until the 1920s. Television came out in the 1920s, wasn't commercially viable till the 1950s. You had TCP IP, came out in 1970, wasn't commercially viable until 1995, when it rolled out in Windows 95. And this is not a technology issue, it's a human conditioning issue. Now, there's something that's really unique that's happening right now. There's a direct parallel from the rollout of TCP IP and what we're seeing from blockchain. So in 1983, TCP IP became the standardization for Internet building 13 years after it, it was originally invented.
00:20:13.536 - 00:20:41.160, Speaker E: And here we are, 13 years after bitcoin is created, and we're starting to see standardization take place almost like a direct parallel to what we saw in TCP IP. So it's not crazy to think that we're still five, seven plus years out till true, you know, till we see true commercial viability, we want it to be commercially viable. Everyone here wants to be the adoption layer, but we're not. We're the infrastructure layer. Right. It's. It's the kids next, right? Every 13 year old on the planet has only existed in a world where bitcoin's existed in three years.
00:20:41.160 - 00:21:04.794, Speaker E: Every 16 year old will only existed in a world where bitcoin existed. 16 is generally where you become a developer, you become interested in it. That's the adoption layer. That's who's going to build a lot of the adoption products. And so the trick is like, can we ensure that they have all the tools necessary, right. In order to build? And yes, that's what you're working on, on the university programs. So it's your job to make sure that they have all the tools necessary.
00:21:04.794 - 00:21:28.548, Speaker E: A lot of pressure and that will happen. Can be faster than that 25 year mark. Right. Things with, you know, one thing that's really unique is, listen, all coding is done in English, right? So there's a globalization factor. This is all open source, so people can all build together and collaborate together. These are things that can move that needle a little bit faster, but inevitably, it's a generational shift in order to kind of drive that adoption long term.
00:21:28.636 - 00:21:50.880, Speaker A: Yeah, we were talking. I see this so clearly because, you know, when I started thinking about universities, I wanted to go in and be like, let's change curriculum. And it was really difficult. But then now I'm at the grassroots level working with the students at their student run blockchain clubs. And these are all kids who did not find the resources they wanted to learn. They are self starters, self educated, and they are, like, on fire.
00:21:50.952 - 00:21:51.136, Speaker E: Right.
00:21:51.160 - 00:21:59.124, Speaker A: It's amazing. And they are definitely going to be building the coolest stuff that you're all going to want to be adopting. So I agree with that. For sure. For sure.
00:22:01.084 - 00:22:01.864, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:04.364 - 00:22:08.484, Speaker A: Yeah. We brought 160 student fellows to breakpoint this year.
00:22:08.604 - 00:22:08.876, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:08.900 - 00:22:22.864, Speaker A: From all over the world, and they are crushing it. Yeah. We're very, like, very happy to have you all here. So what would you guys say would be something that we could do in universities for bringing on those users? Selfish question for me, but.
00:22:24.884 - 00:23:10.944, Speaker B: Yeah, I would actually say, say, when I was at university, I didn't really see, I mean, they were just start, I mean, this was just like, you know, some five years ago, let's say. But they were just, they hadn't really even started with, like, you know, crypto events or that many crypto courses or curriculum, let's say, or even, you know, like clubs. There were not that much there wasn't many, like, community or, like, get togethers for crypto. So I would say that's like a great starting point. Just like, get people together, meet face to face, and just, like, engage in discussion together, you know, to kind of bring really, like, a face on, like, what people are doing in it.
00:23:11.644 - 00:23:23.614, Speaker C: I think, like, ambassadors in the school are great add ons to building the communities. Just like Red Bull ambassadors at every university, they have a champion. They know who to follow, and that sets a good example.
00:23:24.754 - 00:23:47.174, Speaker D: I think. To me it will be like, a lot of diy stuff, because until you're a power user, you're not going to see the Red Bull movement. And maybe even one step further is like, lose your first life savings part of your life. I think that's the one way to also look at it, because when you do it yourself and learn from it, you have to consider the first tuition fee. Then of course, there will be no stopping the students.
00:23:49.174 - 00:24:13.752, Speaker E: I think you should keep in mind that it's not just engineers. The common mistake that's made. I was going to bring this up back to state. We ran out of time. A lot of it's targeted towards engineers, like the validator programs that we talked about. And I'm a big fan of putting validators at universities and then using the rewards of those validators to help drive interest from the students and letting them experiment and play around with the infrastructure side. But that's the engineering piece.
00:24:13.752 - 00:24:33.196, Speaker E: Yeah, and that's great, and that's important. But don't ignore, like, the business side. Don't, you know, avoid the PR side, the ESG side. It's agnostic. Right. Blockchain touches all industries vertically agnostic. It's so like any future lawyer is.
00:24:33.220 - 00:24:35.148, Speaker A: Going to want to know what smart contracts are. Right.
00:24:35.236 - 00:24:38.412, Speaker E: If they don't, we have 27 securities attorneys at Republic.
00:24:38.468 - 00:24:38.684, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:38.724 - 00:25:08.264, Speaker E: So, you know, and we're not a law firm, so that's a really big place. And law firms are problematic for blockchain, mainly because law firms themselves are not motivated to push the envelope. They're risk averse. They're helping manage risk. Hester Pierce has talked a lot about this on the US side, is that the law firms have held the industry back. The reason that we have so many attorneys at Republic is because we believe that we can navigate the space better than outside counsel in a lot of ways.
00:25:08.374 - 00:25:39.340, Speaker A: Yeah, no, but I just mean, like future lawyers, like young kids thinking about that, they're probably thinking about smart contracts or they should be so, like, yeah, it touches every vertical and I also think, like, to your point about like the engineering, it's like not to be so focused on it because, well, the engineers are going to build the infrastructure and do a lot of wonderful things. They probably aren't necessarily the forward people that are going to bring out, you know, the community and the social aspects that we're talking about in that design. So we need everybody and we need to activate everybody in those universities. For sure. For sure. We're running out of time. But I do have like one.
00:25:39.340 - 00:25:49.664, Speaker A: I just want to ask if anybody here, I want to leave, like, space to ask the audience for one question, too. But before that, if anybody here has ever founded a company while drinking mexican car crashes.
00:25:51.884 - 00:26:11.882, Speaker E: Well, we didn't found the company in that. I was CEO of a company called the coin Tree. We were the first multisig security storage company for bitcoin back in 20 11, 20 12, 20 13. What she's referencing is a story of where we were drinking mexican car crashes, which is, I won't get into the details of the drink, but anyway.
00:26:11.938 - 00:26:12.986, Speaker A: Margarita. Beer.
00:26:13.090 - 00:26:29.312, Speaker E: Yeah, beer in Margarita. But we became concerned about what happened to one of us if one of us died. Like, how did we get those assets to their families? And it's a deeper story here, but that was the onerous of a lot of multisig development early on in blockchain.
00:26:29.378 - 00:26:47.484, Speaker A: Yeah, it's amazing. Unless you guys have anything else to say, I wanted to leave it open if somebody did have a question in the audience, if that's cool with you. Does anybody out there have a question they would like to ask? Don't.
00:26:47.564 - 00:26:48.944, Speaker C: Stepin coming back?
00:26:50.684 - 00:26:52.108, Speaker E: Is Stepan coming back?
00:26:52.196 - 00:27:18.914, Speaker B: Stepan is still building strong through the bear. We just recently had announced our AsICs partnership this week. So if you actually preorder the Solana themed Asics shoes, you can get the chance to win the first Asics branded Solana themed stepid Nft on our blockchain.
00:27:23.154 - 00:27:24.666, Speaker A: I guess that's good for us then.
00:27:24.730 - 00:27:25.454, Speaker E: All right.
00:27:26.834 - 00:27:32.002, Speaker A: Thank you guys so much. This was an absolute pleasure. Love speaking with all of you.
00:27:32.018 - 00:27:32.394, Speaker E: Thanks, everybody.
