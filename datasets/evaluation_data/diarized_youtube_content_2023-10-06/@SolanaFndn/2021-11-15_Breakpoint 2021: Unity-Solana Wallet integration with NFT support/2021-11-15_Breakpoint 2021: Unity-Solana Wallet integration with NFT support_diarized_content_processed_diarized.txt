00:00:17.280 - 00:01:12.548, Speaker A: Okay, here we go. Hi, my name is Bukhryvoshia. I'm the chief architect at all art, and I'm here to talk a little bit more about our unity wallet. We started creating wallet at Solana Hackathon earlier this year because we needed a way to implement trading of the NFTs with embedded licenses in our VR application. After that, we decided to make it open source so that anyone can just get it, plug it into his project, and have a head start into the Solana blockchain development. Here we have a little demo of the implementation of the wallet. Just a little bit more.
00:01:12.548 - 00:02:08.234, Speaker A: Here. It imports any unity package with package manager. You can just download it from our git page, or you can host it on your NPM and simply plug it in here. Just bear with me, I'm here. You can then import the sample sample scene with already preset up a small interface where you can create or restore your wallet with key phrase. And there we go. Here we have a peak of gameplay and innovation, but we cannot play it without token.
00:02:08.234 - 00:02:32.294, Speaker A: Here we buy. Oh, something went wrong. Really? Oh really? Great. It's a great start. I guess that's the Internet problem. Okay, let's try again. Okay.
00:02:32.294 - 00:03:13.830, Speaker A: Yep, something went wrong. Okay, let's talk about the wallet then. Just give me a second here. It has pretty basic functionalities any wallet should have. You can receive souls, tokens, everything, or airdrop yourself some. You can send souls. But I need to jump to another wallet to show you a new feature.
00:03:13.830 - 00:04:04.110, Speaker A: We have implemented NFT support, but I guess the Internet is dead. We have implemented NfT support with the metaplex metadata and the NFT pro. So now you can implement nfts into your game any way you want, as an inventory item, as an. You can even treat Nft as a way of buying and selling in app content or even dlcs. The demo was gonna demonstrate that, but I guess the Internet is. Something is wrong with this. Oh yeah, my search.
00:04:04.110 - 00:04:28.854, Speaker A: So see, there we go. Yeah, the Internet is. Okay, something is wrong. Great. I like this. I like this a lot. So we are developing unity wallet alongside our other in house projects.
00:04:28.854 - 00:05:01.794, Speaker A: The only and as we develop the wallet, so the community will be, will have access to all the new features we are developing for us. Let's try restarting the project. Maybe that works. Turn it on and off. Yeah, that usually does the trick. So does anyone have a question while we wait or. No? Okay.
00:05:01.794 - 00:05:27.414, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm terribly sorry. I'm not really versed in public speaking, so bear with my anxiety. Okay, maybe this will work. Okay, maybe, maybe not.
00:05:28.634 - 00:05:34.570, Speaker B: If anybody has a question, I do have the microphone, obviously, so I can come around and hand it off.
00:05:34.602 - 00:05:36.334, Speaker A: There we go. It's working now.
00:05:38.714 - 00:05:42.414, Speaker B: Yes. Perfect. Demos are always.
00:05:44.304 - 00:06:26.964, Speaker A: This is a simple implementation. You can buy tokens that will allow you to play this masterpiece of a game. You can just die here. Great. As you can see with the basic wallet, your beautiful DLC was locked. Now that we have this NfT representing our dlC, it is unlocked. It's another masterful piece of gameplay innovation.
00:06:26.964 - 00:07:18.924, Speaker A: I need a token. Then you can just nft click some NFTs and then sell them for an airdrop. We tried to make Unity Wallet as simple to implement as anything. You simply need to add one component to your scene. You can like here, extend it, but there you will find all the necessary features you need for any wallet to get accounts, token tokens to supply. You can get NFTs connection to the RPC. You can transfer tokens.
00:07:18.924 - 00:08:04.584, Speaker A: You can also extend further as you need more features. So that's basically. Basically you simply need to import it, add a component and start developing and maybe wait for other features that are coming along. What else did I forget about anything? Yeah. For any questions later after this panel, or you can always contact me or part of the team to give your support.
00:08:04.744 - 00:08:07.724, Speaker B: We do have one question over here. Sorry. Hi.
00:08:08.824 - 00:08:57.234, Speaker A: Hello. With mobile developments, are Apple likely to allow NFT transactions? Well, that's a tricky question. There's a lot of problem with general app markets and game markets and custom in game stores. That depends how it will be treated. Steam recently forbid NFT games on their markets, but the epic welcomed everyone. I don't really know what will happen with the apples and mobile markets, but I think the Google story is pretty liberal about anything. So that is still up to debate.
00:08:59.214 - 00:09:00.954, Speaker B: Any other questions out there?
00:09:04.374 - 00:09:05.194, Speaker A: Nope.
00:09:06.854 - 00:09:19.794, Speaker B: I'm gonna come over there. Does your wallet support unlockable content for bloggers and writers?
00:09:20.094 - 00:09:59.694, Speaker A: Unlockable content? Well, you can always implement it with in any way you like. If you want an NFT to represent said content, you can always check the user's wallet. Check for the. If you check for the creator, check for the. If you're using NFT pro, you can always check the collection if the nfts that are representing unlockable content are minted with the collection. So you can implement like that.
00:10:02.474 - 00:10:09.294, Speaker B: We've got time for one more if anybody has a question. Okay.
00:10:11.014 - 00:10:11.754, Speaker A: Great.
00:10:13.854 - 00:10:24.394, Speaker C: I don't have a question, I just want to tell Vuk, tell them that this old things will be available actually next week when we publish them on GitHub, this new version with the NFT support.
00:10:25.974 - 00:10:46.544, Speaker A: Well, already said there is a need for me. Yeah, everything related to the unity wallet will be published on the public repos of all art. So you can always check there, go through the code there and start developing further.
00:10:47.924 - 00:10:58.604, Speaker B: Awesome. Great. Thank you so much. That was actually awesome. I like the little Galaga looking game, so I'm going to go play that. Thank you so much.
