00:00:09.160 - 00:00:38.504, Speaker A: I'm Austin, and this is validated. Welcome to the inaugural episode of Validated. We're trying to do something different from what you expect from a show about web3. Each episode will bring you conversations exploring the technology and philosophies behind web3 with people who are rethinking the Internet and our world today. I'm speaking with Ryan Selkis. If you've been following crypto for a while, or even if you're fairly new to the space, chances are you know who Ryan is. He's best known as the founder of Massari, a crypto research and data firm.
00:00:38.504 - 00:01:15.304, Speaker A: Ryan has been a crypto investor, writer and advocate since 2013. That's almost a decade. He's part of the small cohort of people who actually have a long term enough perspective on the industry to help us zoom out from some of the current market noise and make sense of what's really going on in the world of crypto. As you might expect, Ryan is hopeful in the long term of blockchain. Throughout this conversation, we found some paradoxical silver linings and the tumult of 2022, millions of new users joined the space web. Two platforms expanded their support for web3, and interest from developers has never been higher. At the same time, well, youve seen your portfolio.
00:01:15.304 - 00:01:28.114, Speaker A: We also explore how DCs views of crypto are changing and discuss his work as an advocate for the industry. Let's get into it. Ryan, welcome to validated.
00:01:28.194 - 00:01:29.002, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:29.058 - 00:01:38.210, Speaker A: Yeah, first time we've done this. Glad we get a chance to do this. I'd love to chat a little bit about the ideas and the philosophy of crypto that originally drew you to it back in the day.
00:01:38.282 - 00:01:39.794, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean I've been full.
00:01:39.834 - 00:01:47.162, Speaker C: Time in the space since 2013 and that original cohort was bitcoin only. And it is true that there was.
00:01:47.178 - 00:01:49.472, Speaker B: A strong libertarian streak within the community.
00:01:49.658 - 00:01:51.676, Speaker C: I remember first learning about bitcoin back.
00:01:51.700 - 00:01:53.756, Speaker B: In 2011, and in the US we.
00:01:53.780 - 00:02:04.316, Speaker C: Had this issue known as the debt sequester. And basically it was one of the first really ugly congressional battles that I remember in my adult life where they.
00:02:04.340 - 00:02:07.852, Speaker B: Just could not pass a budget. And basically debt sequestration was going to.
00:02:07.868 - 00:02:10.508, Speaker C: Be across the board, 20% cuts to.
00:02:10.556 - 00:02:11.652, Speaker B: The budget if they couldnt come to.
00:02:11.668 - 00:02:15.032, Speaker C: An agreement by 1159 on this date.
00:02:15.148 - 00:02:16.952, Speaker B: And sure enough, 1158 comes and they.
00:02:16.968 - 00:02:18.856, Speaker C: Say, oh, just kidding, we're going to.
00:02:18.920 - 00:02:20.600, Speaker B: Have file a 90 day extension.
00:02:20.752 - 00:02:23.336, Speaker C: And the next week the US debt.
00:02:23.360 - 00:02:26.096, Speaker B: Was downgraded for the first time ever from like aaa to aa.
00:02:26.160 - 00:02:26.992, Speaker C: I was like, it was a big.
00:02:27.008 - 00:02:29.128, Speaker B: Deal for the markets, it was a big deal in general.
00:02:29.296 - 00:02:31.208, Speaker C: And I was already kind of like.
00:02:31.296 - 00:02:40.368, Speaker B: Libertarian leaning in terms of some of my political, like early twenties, like political philosophy, like Ron Paul ask anti war type libertarian kind of.
00:02:40.456 - 00:02:42.448, Speaker C: That whole streak appealed to me.
00:02:42.616 - 00:02:44.784, Speaker B: I remember digging in at that point.
00:02:44.864 - 00:02:47.656, Speaker C: On the US dollar and its long.
00:02:47.720 - 00:02:52.328, Speaker B: Term viability and learning about the history of reserve currencies and fiat currencies in general.
00:02:52.496 - 00:02:59.552, Speaker C: And when the debt sequester happened, I learned about bitcoin, ignored it, bought gold, shorted the US Treasury ETF, and that.
00:02:59.568 - 00:03:03.256, Speaker B: Was the absolutely correct thesis and literally the only way that you could have.
00:03:03.280 - 00:03:06.544, Speaker C: Lost money on that trade. Fortunately, I came back to it a.
00:03:06.544 - 00:03:25.986, Speaker B: Couple of years later, and at that point, Coinbase had launched, the Winkelvoss twins had revealed their ETF plans, and then, very importantly, Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road was shut down in kind of mid 2013. And that's when I really started to dig in and happened to be transitioning from my first startup, which took a couple of years and then fizzled out.
00:03:26.090 - 00:03:27.434, Speaker C: And I had some free time on my hands.
00:03:27.474 - 00:03:31.106, Speaker B: So I got into it just as a curiosity and then kind of lucked.
00:03:31.130 - 00:03:35.986, Speaker C: Into it from that kind of philosophical standpoint and then got fully red pilled.
00:03:36.010 - 00:03:39.312, Speaker B: After reading the white paper and started writing about it pretty much immediately.
00:03:39.458 - 00:03:42.876, Speaker C: And then here we are ten years later. And obviously it's quite a bit broader.
00:03:42.900 - 00:03:44.276, Speaker B: Than just bitcoin at this point.
00:03:44.340 - 00:03:47.012, Speaker A: So as someone who kind of got into it with a little bit of.
00:03:47.028 - 00:03:49.668, Speaker D: This libertarian streak, I talked to a.
00:03:49.676 - 00:03:50.740, Speaker A: Lot of folks who were kind of.
00:03:50.772 - 00:03:54.412, Speaker D: Around in that era, and they have.
00:03:54.468 - 00:04:04.996, Speaker A: Trouble recognizing a lot of the values that maybe originally drew them to crypto nowadays, especially folks who are really who for bitcoin, that was their gateway drug into.
00:04:05.100 - 00:04:06.606, Speaker D: Into the crypto space.
00:04:06.780 - 00:04:25.434, Speaker A: How does someone like you, who obviously that's the stuff that attracted you originally, was this sort of full, self sovereign idea, but you've stayed hopeful about the space. How do you view the differences between where crypto is in 2022 from a philosophical standpoint versus where it was in 2013 and what pulled you in then?
00:04:25.554 - 00:04:27.586, Speaker C: I think it's actually really healthy to.
00:04:27.610 - 00:04:29.586, Speaker B: Have the degree of skepticism that we.
00:04:29.610 - 00:04:42.824, Speaker C: Have in the industry across most different ecosystem participants. And I don't. I think the don't trust verify ethos has stayed pretty consistent.
00:04:42.864 - 00:04:48.016, Speaker B: But you've seen like, different forks in communities, and there are some exceptions to this. I don't mean to paint everybody with.
00:04:48.080 - 00:04:56.176, Speaker C: A really broad negative brush, but most, quote, unquote bitcoin maximalists are much newer. You know, you look at, you know.
00:04:56.200 - 00:05:00.440, Speaker B: Vitalik was an early bitcoiner. Eric Voorhees was an early bitcoiner. I was an early bitcoiner.
00:05:00.472 - 00:05:09.482, Speaker C: You know, dozens of us were early bitcoiners because thats the only asset that really mattered. But we still saw the value and the potential of things like Ethereum and.
00:05:09.498 - 00:05:11.810, Speaker B: Then later some of the other layer ones.
00:05:11.842 - 00:05:15.986, Speaker C: And defi and nfts were curious about.
00:05:16.010 - 00:05:20.170, Speaker B: It, but were also very deeply skeptical about the motivations of folks that get.
00:05:20.202 - 00:05:26.514, Speaker C: Into the space that are new. And its almost like they have to prove their stripes and actually demonstrate some.
00:05:26.554 - 00:05:29.634, Speaker B: Degree of long termism and mission driven.
00:05:29.674 - 00:05:33.394, Speaker C: Focus before they're trusted or taken seriously.
00:05:33.774 - 00:05:35.750, Speaker B: And in that end, I feel like.
00:05:35.782 - 00:05:41.126, Speaker C: Every time that there's a crisis within a given community and they go through.
00:05:41.150 - 00:05:42.910, Speaker B: Their trough of disillusionment and then come.
00:05:42.942 - 00:05:46.118, Speaker C: Roaring back stronger and more resilient and.
00:05:46.166 - 00:05:49.670, Speaker B: At a higher high or more decentralized or whatever you think about the right.
00:05:49.702 - 00:05:53.662, Speaker C: Rubric to be, that's when it's almost.
00:05:53.678 - 00:06:01.526, Speaker B: Like you've earned your stripes. And you can tell that people are kind of in this for the long haul and not just taking shortcuts or basically trying to create some kind of.
00:06:01.550 - 00:06:04.630, Speaker C: Parasitic relationship with what is otherwise.
00:06:04.662 - 00:06:09.526, Speaker B: I think a really optimistic ecosystem and technology thats an optimistic bet on the future.
00:06:09.710 - 00:06:11.470, Speaker C: I think we always get maligned during.
00:06:11.502 - 00:06:12.974, Speaker B: The bear markets and the crashes.
00:06:13.094 - 00:06:18.574, Speaker C: But if you look at the folks that are responsible for the crashes, theyre always the folks that were the hangers.
00:06:18.614 - 00:06:23.270, Speaker B: On and the malignancies in the market anyway. Theyre very, very rarely the builders and.
00:06:23.342 - 00:06:25.152, Speaker C: The people that kind of came in.
00:06:25.168 - 00:06:30.656, Speaker B: With a really mission driven focus. I'm not going to even say his name because I've already committed to that for the new year.
00:06:30.680 - 00:06:35.304, Speaker C: But certain people were 100% direct about.
00:06:35.344 - 00:06:36.344, Speaker B: Not caring about crypto.
00:06:36.384 - 00:06:43.400, Speaker C: It was just an asset to trade. And you could tell because they told you that all they cared about was.
00:06:43.432 - 00:06:53.944, Speaker B: Making as much money as fast as possible for whatever other end they had. And so I, for one, and I know many others, were very deeply skeptical of that type of mindset for certain.
00:06:53.984 - 00:06:56.952, Speaker C: Individuals that we saw do very well.
00:06:57.048 - 00:06:59.296, Speaker B: In 2020 and 2021, but then this.
00:06:59.320 - 00:07:02.592, Speaker C: Year, it kind of fizzled. On the other hand, you look at.
00:07:02.648 - 00:07:03.856, Speaker B: Some of the builders, the year that.
00:07:03.880 - 00:07:06.464, Speaker C: Ethereum had was tremendous with the merge.
00:07:06.544 - 00:07:11.064, Speaker B: And the success that they had and the success of rollups. I wrote about this in the annual.
00:07:11.104 - 00:07:14.168, Speaker C: Report, but I view this as one.
00:07:14.176 - 00:07:21.218, Speaker B: Of those formational, foundational years for the Solana ecosystem because you see how much is going on and how much is getting built.
00:07:21.336 - 00:07:23.630, Speaker C: You've very violently taken out the weak.
00:07:23.662 - 00:07:27.326, Speaker B: Hands and had to kind of go through this crisis of confidence.
00:07:27.470 - 00:07:28.662, Speaker C: But now it's kind of like a.
00:07:28.678 - 00:07:40.238, Speaker B: Make or break year. And if you have the solid enough foundation, which I happen to think Solana does in terms of developer interest, in terms of like, innovation around the edges and infrastructure, then that's where you're really positioned for, like the resurgence.
00:07:40.286 - 00:07:46.382, Speaker C: And then in a couple of years, people that are open minded will say the same thing about Solana, that bitcoiners.
00:07:46.398 - 00:07:47.766, Speaker B: Who are skeptical of Ethereum now say.
00:07:47.790 - 00:07:49.912, Speaker C: About Ethereum, right, thats kind of like.
00:07:50.008 - 00:07:51.840, Speaker B: The crypto circle of life, if you will.
00:07:51.872 - 00:07:55.000, Speaker C: Theres a rise, a crash, and then.
00:07:55.032 - 00:07:58.704, Speaker B: Do you have what it takes to get off the mat and resurge? And if you do, then it means.
00:07:58.744 - 00:08:01.472, Speaker C: Youve probably got that missionary core and.
00:08:01.488 - 00:08:05.296, Speaker B: The folks that are really kind of committed to the long term vision of what this industry could be.
00:08:05.360 - 00:08:14.136, Speaker A: I kind of love existing in paradoxes because I think theyre where the most interesting questions get asked. And 2022 was one of those years, because if you had no context of.
00:08:14.160 - 00:08:18.416, Speaker D: Token price, you'd have thought this was the biggest year for blockchain yet, right?
00:08:18.480 - 00:08:33.560, Speaker A: Web two companies started doing full integrations. Mainstream adoption sort of started coming much more. The on chain activity for protocols like Solana skyrocketed. Ethereum successfully swapped engines on the car while the car was still running. Like they, they did the hard thing. Right.
00:08:33.632 - 00:08:36.688, Speaker D: This was the year where actually, if you look at it, like, stuff kind.
00:08:36.696 - 00:08:38.312, Speaker A: Of took off in mainstream, and yet.
00:08:38.408 - 00:08:41.120, Speaker D: What we've seen is kind of the opposite of that.
00:08:41.232 - 00:08:48.560, Speaker A: If you start looking at the price, right. I don't think I've ever seen a place where the market story and the technology story and the adoption story are.
00:08:48.592 - 00:08:50.808, Speaker D: Further apart, at least in recent memory.
00:08:50.896 - 00:08:52.592, Speaker C: In short, all the people and products.
00:08:52.648 - 00:08:53.832, Speaker B: That I didn't like are dead.
00:08:53.928 - 00:08:55.136, Speaker C: And all the people that I liked.
00:08:55.160 - 00:09:23.796, Speaker B: And projects that I was excited about are thriving. So I can't remember a time that I was more excited about a year. And we track this with our reports on a quarterly basis. Our mission really the product vision that we have is to create real time financial reporting for crypto community is not enough to bitch about the SEC. We actually think that we can build 100 x better information system for community traded assets. And we do reporting on all these different projects where you look at the.
00:09:23.820 - 00:09:48.318, Speaker C: Price, theyre down 75, 80, 95%. But you look at the metrics, whether its transactions number of nfts with distributed file storage systems, the utilization rate of decentralized hardware networks quarter over quarter, 50%, 60%, 70% growth. Stable coins like quarter in, quarter out.
00:09:48.446 - 00:09:51.806, Speaker B: November and December were record all time months for stablecoins.
00:09:51.870 - 00:09:57.846, Speaker C: USDC and Paxos issued stable coins are flying and theyre closer than ever to.
00:09:57.870 - 00:10:10.162, Speaker B: Being institutionally or kind of internationally recognized under given regulatory frameworks. Those are the things that are really zero to one improvements in terms of adoption and integration into the financial system.
00:10:10.318 - 00:10:12.498, Speaker C: And they're not showing signs of slowing down.
00:10:12.546 - 00:10:14.854, Speaker B: So the only concern I really have.
00:10:15.154 - 00:10:17.410, Speaker C: Is, are people going to take this.
00:10:17.442 - 00:10:19.962, Speaker B: Opportunity to kind of recommit and refocus.
00:10:20.058 - 00:10:24.586, Speaker C: Efforts and discard the noise and the get rich quick shit and like all.
00:10:24.610 - 00:10:28.786, Speaker B: The other distractions and shiny objects that will ultimately be their undoing if they.
00:10:28.810 - 00:10:33.802, Speaker C: Wait too long to fix it? Or is, you know, it's kind of like, you know, if folks that are.
00:10:33.818 - 00:10:35.818, Speaker B: Listening work out, right, like 2021 was.
00:10:35.826 - 00:10:38.220, Speaker C: A bulk year and then we had.
00:10:38.292 - 00:10:40.452, Speaker B: Folks get their ass kicked because they were a little bit too out of.
00:10:40.468 - 00:10:43.372, Speaker C: Shape from the bulk year. And now this year, it's kind of.
00:10:43.388 - 00:10:47.548, Speaker B: Like the next part of the rocky montage where it's like, okay, let me get my ass back in shape.
00:10:47.676 - 00:10:49.332, Speaker C: We're going to cut and then we're.
00:10:49.348 - 00:10:57.396, Speaker B: Going to be ready for the much bigger fight and to get back at it. So I know some people will listen to this and think that I'm being sanguine, but the reality is I've lived.
00:10:57.420 - 00:11:09.880, Speaker C: Through two full cycles now, and this cycle, like the end of it, feels so much healthier than the last two. In 2018, it wasnt obvious that there was going to be any tokens of.
00:11:09.912 - 00:11:16.768, Speaker B: Real value or any networks that were going to have economics that made sense or applications that worked. Now you turn around and youve had.
00:11:16.856 - 00:11:20.920, Speaker C: All these crazy and composable upgrades in.
00:11:20.992 - 00:11:27.832, Speaker B: Defi and scaling solutions and inter blockchain communications. Crypto is not going to be uninvented. The biggest hindrance now is going to.
00:11:27.848 - 00:11:30.916, Speaker C: Be how can we actually demonstrate that.
00:11:30.940 - 00:11:32.860, Speaker B: This is valuable tech that's good for.
00:11:32.892 - 00:11:40.076, Speaker C: Society so that we don't face just a ridiculous number of roadblocks and hurdles that are thrown at us from governments?
00:11:40.100 - 00:11:46.652, Speaker B: Because I think that's the final boss stage that we're at right now. Versus are people going to care about crypto? I think that ship has sailed.
00:11:46.708 - 00:11:48.500, Speaker C: And the answer is that people are.
00:11:48.692 - 00:11:50.852, Speaker B: Understanding of the potential of these technologies.
00:11:50.948 - 00:11:58.586, Speaker A: Yeah, looking at some of those organizations that have had challenges through 2022. Most failures we've seen, I think Terra.
00:11:58.610 - 00:12:00.658, Speaker D: Is probably the exception here, have been.
00:12:00.706 - 00:12:04.250, Speaker A: Failures of centralized entities and centralized exchanges.
00:12:04.402 - 00:12:08.322, Speaker D: They were folks who are not primarily doing on chain transactions.
00:12:08.378 - 00:12:13.826, Speaker A: They were folks who were primarily transacting off chain and primarily had obligations that existed off chain.
00:12:13.970 - 00:12:15.354, Speaker D: What do you think the future of.
00:12:15.394 - 00:12:18.778, Speaker A: These sort of centralized exchanges and centralized entities are?
00:12:18.826 - 00:12:24.366, Speaker D: It feels like every cycle they get built up and then they explode catastrophically.
00:12:24.510 - 00:12:42.870, Speaker A: And this doesn't happen as much in the traditional financial space. And this is kind of a real clash, I think, between folks who look at this space and think we need more regulation and folks who think we don't need more regulation. But it is a pattern that does seem to exist. That's always the off chain stuff that causes the problem. For folks on chain, I think it's.
00:12:42.942 - 00:12:48.124, Speaker C: A bit of a false choice to have DeFi versus C five thought of.
00:12:48.744 - 00:12:51.576, Speaker B: As kind of a black or white thing. I do think that theres a spectrum.
00:12:51.680 - 00:12:53.336, Speaker C: And weve seen more of it this year.
00:12:53.400 - 00:13:06.360, Speaker B: Youve started to see some of the big DeFi protocols incorporate real world assets. I think that financialization and that trend is going to be a big driver of growth in some pockets of crypto in 2023 and going forward.
00:13:06.552 - 00:13:08.464, Speaker C: On the other hand, ironically, one of.
00:13:08.464 - 00:13:15.310, Speaker B: The most interesting integrations of the year was ledger live and FTX. Ledger customers were able to trade using.
00:13:15.342 - 00:13:20.678, Speaker C: The FTX order book and liquidity from their ledger devices. Those customers did not get wrecked, right.
00:13:20.726 - 00:13:23.742, Speaker B: Because the only time that they interacted with FTX was that moment of time.
00:13:23.798 - 00:13:25.438, Speaker C: The orders were getting filled, right.
00:13:25.486 - 00:13:32.274, Speaker B: And then the assets were like self custodied and safely secured. Otherwise, on like the individual hardware devices.
00:13:32.574 - 00:13:39.718, Speaker C: Some people will just say, you know what, I trust my fidelity account. I'm going to trust Coinbase as a custodian because they're well regulated.
00:13:39.766 - 00:13:50.210, Speaker B: We know they're reserved. They go through like X, Y and Z. In that respect. Good regulation, good oversight is really strong for the industry. Its a positive for the industry, for those centralized players.
00:13:50.402 - 00:13:51.818, Speaker C: On the other hand, as long as.
00:13:51.826 - 00:13:55.802, Speaker B: You keep the bridges open between peer to peer finance and centralized finance, and.
00:13:55.858 - 00:14:05.682, Speaker C: You have a good balance, then people can pick and choose what risks theyre willing to accept. Im willing to accept centralized exchange risk.
00:14:05.738 - 00:14:16.018, Speaker B: Because I dont want to worry about my personal security and my personal key management. And for some people, I consider myself like this. I'm actually less concerned about my ability.
00:14:16.066 - 00:14:17.970, Speaker C: To manage my own keys and more.
00:14:18.002 - 00:14:19.946, Speaker B: Concerned about a $5 wrench attack.
00:14:20.090 - 00:14:22.858, Speaker C: So I am still going to prefer.
00:14:22.906 - 00:14:28.082, Speaker B: Something like Anchorage or Coinbase in many scenarios because I know that that's built in.
00:14:28.138 - 00:14:30.578, Speaker C: And so you have to trust some.
00:14:30.626 - 00:14:35.138, Speaker B: Institution or some products at some point with something like key security.
00:14:35.226 - 00:14:36.876, Speaker C: But that doesn't mean that you should.
00:14:36.900 - 00:14:40.668, Speaker B: Be giving up all of your autonomy and all of your ability to interface.
00:14:40.756 - 00:14:45.372, Speaker C: With these peer to peer networks. I think the fact that these different.
00:14:45.428 - 00:14:46.980, Speaker B: Parts of the ecosystem are getting built.
00:14:47.012 - 00:14:52.436, Speaker C: Up in parallel, it does two things. One, I think it's net helpful in.
00:14:52.500 - 00:14:58.116, Speaker B: Allowing people to choose their own adventure and whatever user experience is best going forward.
00:14:58.300 - 00:15:02.044, Speaker C: But it also creates a level of.
00:15:02.084 - 00:15:14.052, Speaker B: Resilience and anti fragility in the downside scenarios because it forces more hostile actors, particularly at the state level, from being really effective with crackdowns. It creates a little bit of a.
00:15:14.068 - 00:15:17.628, Speaker C: Better game of whack a mole. And in the west, I think you.
00:15:17.636 - 00:15:23.788, Speaker B: Can say that out loud a little bit more assertively, especially in the US, because we've got these first and Fourth.
00:15:23.836 - 00:15:30.156, Speaker C: And 10th Amendment protections. But in other parts of the world that is an imperative.
00:15:30.340 - 00:15:34.856, Speaker B: If you're talking about folks in high inflation countries or with capital controls or.
00:15:35.000 - 00:15:41.384, Speaker C: Just significant geopolitical dysfunction, then it starts to feel a little bit more real.
00:15:41.424 - 00:15:49.444, Speaker B: Even for the monetary and defi use cases versus here in the US, where it's like, oh, now we're talking about hardware networks and decentralized social and nfts.
00:15:50.464 - 00:15:52.760, Speaker C: Yeah, because that's what can have mainstream.
00:15:52.792 - 00:15:55.536, Speaker B: Appeal here, because most people aren't worried about JP Morgan going under.
00:15:55.600 - 00:15:57.280, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's such a good.
00:15:57.312 - 00:15:59.488, Speaker D: Point, which is I think we all.
00:15:59.536 - 00:16:48.016, Speaker A: Basically trust FDIC at the end of the day, and FDIC is an anomaly on the world stage. Most countries and most banks don't have that kind of government backstop on personal deposit accounts. So a lot of this tech, I mean, there's obviously a huge number of developers on Solana and other blockchains that were in Ukraine. And their ability to either, because they had assets in crypto, either leave and get their families out and still have access to capital, or stay and be able to buy stuff they needed to even when the traditional financial payment rails weren't functioning and swift was doing a bunch of weird stuff to kind of cut Ukraine off. Very, very interesting to kind of see the role of crypto stepping in in situations like that. So one of the things I would love to talk a little about is as the interfaces between web two and.
00:16:48.040 - 00:16:50.400, Speaker D: Web three become murkier.
00:16:50.472 - 00:16:50.680, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:50.712 - 00:16:58.360, Speaker A: They become more integrated. Exactly. What you're talking about the ability to trade from ledger live, hitting the FTX order book, what is the sort of.
00:16:58.392 - 00:17:02.224, Speaker D: Role you see of public perception? I think if you deal with a.
00:17:02.264 - 00:17:10.192, Speaker A: Large web two company, the expectation is one of customer service. It's one of a dependable product that if I can't send a tweet, I.
00:17:10.208 - 00:17:11.404, Speaker D: Get mad at Twitter.
00:17:12.064 - 00:17:20.736, Speaker A: If I can't log on to a specific application, there's an idea of someone needs to fix this for me. And the core tenet of blockchain is.
00:17:20.840 - 00:17:23.284, Speaker D: There'S no one who can do this except me.
00:17:23.664 - 00:17:25.728, Speaker A: How do you think about those two.
00:17:25.776 - 00:17:28.600, Speaker D: Cultures merging or adapting?
00:17:28.672 - 00:17:36.808, Speaker A: Because on the face of it, they're fairly incompatible. Just expectations that users might have for systems when they're using them.
00:17:36.896 - 00:17:38.312, Speaker C: I know I've been pretty public about.
00:17:38.328 - 00:17:39.160, Speaker B: This, but I think this is just.
00:17:39.192 - 00:17:48.168, Speaker C: Such a failure of the regulatory state to pick the right battles. There's this general misconception and misperception, I.
00:17:48.176 - 00:17:50.104, Speaker B: Think, of folks outside of crypto that.
00:17:50.224 - 00:17:52.592, Speaker C: It'S the Wild west and people are.
00:17:52.608 - 00:17:59.128, Speaker B: Fighting against regulation and good policy and oversight, and it's complete nonsense, you know, and folks, folks that are in the.
00:17:59.136 - 00:18:07.688, Speaker C: Trenches know we're down in DC or we're in Europe and we're talking to policymakers. And yes, if the conversation is self.
00:18:07.736 - 00:18:09.644, Speaker B: Custody and privacy are going to be.
00:18:09.944 - 00:18:12.672, Speaker C: Illegalized and peer to peer finance is.
00:18:12.688 - 00:18:13.576, Speaker B: Going to have to go through a.
00:18:13.640 - 00:18:26.130, Speaker C: Central, like, authorities registration process, the answer is no. Like we are going to fight that. But why is that blocking good stablecoin policy? Why is that blocking exchange oversight and.
00:18:26.162 - 00:18:42.454, Speaker B: Custodial oversight the same way that you would have in the traditional markets, whether youre talking about banks, securities dealers or the like. So it really comes down to just treating like for like, but without kind of, you know, throwing the baby out with the bathwater and really kind of crippling innovation in the sphere.
00:18:42.754 - 00:18:47.082, Speaker C: And if you had that, if you had some common sense on the part.
00:18:47.098 - 00:18:54.258, Speaker B: Of the regulators, we wouldnt have things like FTX, right? You wouldnt have Malcox, you wouldnt have a lot of these centralized failures.
00:18:54.426 - 00:18:57.434, Speaker C: And I think in many cases their.
00:18:57.474 - 00:18:59.614, Speaker B: Eyes are just totally off the ball.
00:18:59.954 - 00:19:05.914, Speaker C: And I know ive been critical about the SEC, but this is the perfect case in point. I mean, grayscale right now, the biggest.
00:19:05.954 - 00:19:18.050, Speaker B: Asset manager in the world, they own 3% of bitcoin and Ethereum, and theyre in a tough spot because whats happening with this massive discount, their shareholders are underwater.
00:19:18.082 - 00:19:20.912, Speaker C: The tune of almost $8 billion, which.
00:19:20.928 - 00:19:22.584, Speaker B: Is more than FTX lost investors.
00:19:22.664 - 00:19:23.360, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:23.552 - 00:19:29.624, Speaker B: So $8 billion worth of impairment, that's not Grayscale's fault. That's the SEC's fault for being obstinate.
00:19:29.664 - 00:19:35.336, Speaker C: And refusing to create any structures where either investors could redeem their shares in.
00:19:35.360 - 00:19:37.720, Speaker B: These trust products for the underlying assets.
00:19:37.872 - 00:19:40.760, Speaker C: Or more importantly, just approve a spot.
00:19:40.792 - 00:19:44.040, Speaker B: ETF instead of trying to block this.
00:19:44.192 - 00:19:47.140, Speaker C: Obstinately for years, because what you're really.
00:19:47.172 - 00:19:56.268, Speaker B: Trying to do is play a hostage negotiation role in making sure that you have oversight of the exchanges, and then maybe we'll let you kind of have these products trade.
00:19:56.356 - 00:20:10.572, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd love to kind of go into that a little bit more. What are the changes? Let's use grayscale as an example here. What are the changes that the SEC could make that would have alleviated the situation a little bit more point blank?
00:20:10.628 - 00:20:13.212, Speaker B: A lot of this contagion would never have happened if they had approved a.
00:20:13.228 - 00:20:20.494, Speaker C: Spot ETF after they approved the futures ETF. The spot ETF is derivatives are based on spot.
00:20:20.614 - 00:20:30.198, Speaker B: Thats why theyre called derivatives. And yet a derivatives based ETF with a much higher fee structure was approved a year and a half ago almost.
00:20:30.366 - 00:20:37.566, Speaker C: And yet the spot ETF was continuously disallowed and blocked for reasons that seemed arbitrary and capricious.
00:20:37.710 - 00:20:39.430, Speaker B: And grayscale is actually suing them over this.
00:20:39.462 - 00:20:42.768, Speaker C: As a result, once those toxic assets.
00:20:42.816 - 00:20:48.872, Speaker B: And that product was out in the wild and these assets were trapped, and you had this market dysfunction because of.
00:20:48.888 - 00:20:55.112, Speaker C: The SECs obstinate, then it created this system of bad collateral that had a.
00:20:55.128 - 00:21:08.592, Speaker B: Cascading effect across multiple different entities. First it was three arrows, and then it ultimately trickled into blockfi. Then it again trickled into FTX. That's a big reason that we had this credit contagion is due to this.
00:21:08.648 - 00:21:10.368, Speaker C: One product and the fact that it.
00:21:10.376 - 00:21:18.404, Speaker B: Was used as collateral and that collateral was toxic because of its illiquidity and all the SEC driven dysfunction around its redeemability.
00:21:20.424 - 00:21:22.164, Speaker C: It's just basic math.
00:21:22.904 - 00:21:29.760, Speaker B: And just looking at the timeline of events to show that this happened, and a big reason that it happened was due to this policy.
00:21:29.832 - 00:21:31.832, Speaker C: That doesn't really make much sense if.
00:21:31.848 - 00:21:38.828, Speaker B: Your mandate is to protect investors, promote fair and efficient markets, and promote capital formation, which is literally on the SECs website.
00:21:38.916 - 00:21:44.276, Speaker A: So do you think the SEC should have basically declined to approve a futures without a spot?
00:21:44.340 - 00:21:46.444, Speaker B: No, I think that both should have been fair game.
00:21:46.484 - 00:21:46.756, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:46.820 - 00:21:48.828, Speaker B: It completely makes sense that both would be fair game.
00:21:48.876 - 00:21:56.956, Speaker C: But I think its completely counterintuitive to approve a derivatives product before approving a.
00:21:56.980 - 00:22:03.062, Speaker B: Spot based product because the derivative is derived from the spot. Right. It's just, it doesn't make any sense at all.
00:22:03.158 - 00:22:06.910, Speaker C: And I think they know that. But the reason, the stated reason is.
00:22:06.942 - 00:22:09.566, Speaker B: That there's no surveillance of the underlying spot markets.
00:22:09.630 - 00:22:16.726, Speaker C: And what they really mean by that is we don't have SEC registered spot crypto exchanges.
00:22:16.830 - 00:22:26.152, Speaker A: Isn't that kind of a fair criticism, though, if you're taking a spot product and bringing it onto a regulated exchange, that the underlying market should also be within that same framework?
00:22:26.238 - 00:22:30.444, Speaker B: Well, I think you have to look at what happens with commodity based ETF's that are spot driven.
00:22:30.564 - 00:22:31.788, Speaker C: Like the gold ETF.
00:22:31.916 - 00:22:37.532, Speaker B: It's apples oranges in that case. But the regulators are jockeying for position.
00:22:37.628 - 00:22:41.908, Speaker C: Because of crypto's uniqueness on Coinbase and.
00:22:42.076 - 00:22:45.388, Speaker B: Kraken and other exchanges. You can trade bitcoin, you can trade.
00:22:45.556 - 00:22:47.932, Speaker C: Ether, you can trade all these other assets.
00:22:47.988 - 00:22:52.156, Speaker B: And now, like the long tails, some of them start to look like security. So because some of them look like.
00:22:52.180 - 00:22:58.350, Speaker C: Securities to the SEC, now it's this, we will not negotiate until we have.
00:22:58.382 - 00:23:00.046, Speaker B: Oversight type of dynamic, and then that's.
00:23:00.110 - 00:23:01.674, Speaker C: Created all these ripple effects.
00:23:01.974 - 00:23:03.686, Speaker B: Good policy would have solved this years.
00:23:03.710 - 00:23:06.526, Speaker C: Ago, but we have a pretty dysfunctional.
00:23:06.590 - 00:23:13.798, Speaker B: System right now, I think in the US and in some cases it's more dysfunctional in Europe. But in other cases, I think Europe.
00:23:13.886 - 00:23:15.382, Speaker C: Is way ahead of us when it.
00:23:15.398 - 00:23:17.310, Speaker B: Comes to common sense crypto regulation.
00:23:17.422 - 00:23:17.766, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:17.830 - 00:23:23.070, Speaker A: So when you're talking to regulators or politicians about blockchain and crypto and web.
00:23:23.102 - 00:23:25.356, Speaker D: Three, there's a lot of harm that.
00:23:25.420 - 00:23:42.836, Speaker A: Some individuals and bad actors have done this year, have done over previous years. What is the tenor of those conversations like? Are you in a situation where you're trying to convince them that the net positive is worth it against the net negative of these bad actors? What are those type of questions that.
00:23:42.860 - 00:23:45.516, Speaker D: You get from them look like around, basically?
00:23:45.660 - 00:23:49.764, Speaker A: Are you asked to justify Kryptos existence? Are you asked to paint a rosy future for them?
00:23:49.804 - 00:23:51.330, Speaker D: What are those questions like?
00:23:51.452 - 00:23:54.358, Speaker B: Well, I think there's two separate sets of questions, right?
00:23:54.406 - 00:23:59.166, Speaker C: There's questions and relationships with the regulators, and then there's questions of policy, which.
00:23:59.190 - 00:24:03.834, Speaker B: Is, are we going to get comprehensive legislation and kind of guidance in the US?
00:24:04.214 - 00:24:09.774, Speaker C: And unfortunately, I think it's a long shot that we get comprehensive legislation in.
00:24:09.774 - 00:24:16.566, Speaker B: The US just based on kind of the politics of post election day and the new Congress that's getting sworn in.
00:24:16.710 - 00:24:20.126, Speaker C: There's really three things that I think we need to see in terms of.
00:24:20.150 - 00:24:25.078, Speaker B: Guidance in the US. And things that have to be driven by statute of just regulator guidance.
00:24:25.246 - 00:24:27.222, Speaker C: The first and maybe the easiest, the.
00:24:27.238 - 00:24:28.022, Speaker B: One that we have a shot at.
00:24:28.038 - 00:24:44.550, Speaker C: Getting right in the next year or two, is around stable coins. It's because they're easy to understand. They're very important to the crypto ecosystem. They're also really interesting and important structured products that ultimately, I think, could extend.
00:24:44.662 - 00:24:47.518, Speaker B: The dominance of the dollar and the digital dollar.
00:24:47.606 - 00:24:49.446, Speaker C: The other one, which is really where.
00:24:49.470 - 00:24:50.502, Speaker B: A lot of us were hoping we.
00:24:50.518 - 00:25:02.502, Speaker C: Could get with the DCCPA. This stab and out Bozeman bill that FTX had a role in pushing, it was flawed in the sense that it was attempting to capture Defi and put.
00:25:02.518 - 00:25:04.886, Speaker B: It under the same framework as kind of these centralized exchanges.
00:25:04.950 - 00:25:06.982, Speaker C: And if we could just focus on.
00:25:07.038 - 00:25:11.206, Speaker B: The centralized custodians, exchanges, broker dealers, I think that we could actually see some.
00:25:11.230 - 00:25:24.386, Speaker C: Good policy in the next year or two. That's still going to leave the number three priority, which is really where the rubber meets the road for, for a lot of crypto beyond bitcoin. And that is whats the definition of.
00:25:24.410 - 00:25:26.058, Speaker B: A commodity versus a security.
00:25:26.226 - 00:25:29.210, Speaker C: What type of information reporting systems do we have?
00:25:29.322 - 00:25:33.722, Speaker B: What is the safe harbor or the.
00:25:33.738 - 00:25:37.594, Speaker C: Standard that we need to build to make sure that we can have innovation.
00:25:37.634 - 00:25:46.850, Speaker B: In tokens, but we still have investor protections. That is a really messy middle to navigate. And frankly, is one of the reasons that we started Masari, because we knew that this was going to take probably.
00:25:46.882 - 00:25:49.186, Speaker C: A decade for folks to wrap their.
00:25:49.210 - 00:25:51.946, Speaker B: Heads around and build policy around because.
00:25:52.090 - 00:26:06.498, Speaker C: Theres no black and white solution. So I think were in a bit of a foot race, us as a company, to basically demonstrate, can we and other kind of information players build real time financial reporting equivalents that are like.
00:26:06.546 - 00:26:09.754, Speaker B: Ten x or 100 x improvements on the EDGAr system?
00:26:09.914 - 00:26:12.666, Speaker C: Because if we can, you can show.
00:26:12.690 - 00:26:14.106, Speaker B: Your work and say what you were.
00:26:14.130 - 00:26:19.858, Speaker C: Proposing would be actively worse in terms of information symmetry and in terms of.
00:26:19.866 - 00:26:25.986, Speaker B: The performance of these networks than what the industry has already been able to build itself. Because all of this accounting infrastructure is.
00:26:26.010 - 00:26:27.754, Speaker C: Public, the blockchains are public. Yeah.
00:26:27.794 - 00:26:34.874, Speaker A: So one of the things, I mean, there's this great Twitter meme, which is that if cash were invented today, it wouldn't pass the Howie test.
00:26:34.994 - 00:26:35.298, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:35.346 - 00:26:41.122, Speaker A: Which is, I think, a very funny oversimplification of what that would look like. But there is some truth to the.
00:26:41.138 - 00:26:44.082, Speaker D: Fact that legacy products are legacy products.
00:26:44.138 - 00:26:55.322, Speaker A: And they're grandfathered in. I think there's a lot of desire for an overhaul of securities legislation in the United States. There's this, we have to really start from the beginning. We have to rewrite this stuff. I think if you go to most.
00:26:55.378 - 00:26:57.498, Speaker D: Interest groups, they would have that exact.
00:26:57.546 - 00:27:20.192, Speaker A: Same criticism about whatever piece of legislation impacts their industry. I have friends who work in the power industry or work on environmental regulation, and their criticisms are the same. We need to rewrite all of these laws. And I think what we've historically seen from Congress has very little appetite for wholesale rewrites. And instead we get things like the way the ACA was done as sort.
00:27:20.208 - 00:27:22.312, Speaker D: Of a bunch of weird loopholes and.
00:27:22.328 - 00:27:45.234, Speaker A: The way budget reconciliation is done nowadays, it's all a bunch of weird loopholes to get stuff passed. I think, as I mentioned, there's a real strong desire to do something that's sort of wholesale. Let's rewrite the thing. Barring that, are there smaller changes that you could see making a bigger impact that maybe don't get to the core of the issue, but they at least allow more of this development to move back onshore?
00:27:45.314 - 00:27:52.322, Speaker B: Id like to paint a rosy picture. I think the answer is probably no. I think were likely going to be in limbo the next couple of years.
00:27:52.378 - 00:27:55.826, Speaker C: I mean, theres a lot of us that are trying to spend time with.
00:27:55.850 - 00:27:58.010, Speaker B: Policymakers and kind of have these balanced.
00:27:58.042 - 00:28:00.826, Speaker C: Conversations, not selling out the industry, but.
00:28:00.890 - 00:28:04.090, Speaker B: Kind of listening and kind of proposing solutions bi directionally.
00:28:04.122 - 00:28:14.360, Speaker C: But I think the reality is that weve been set back so far by the events of last year that are, the repercussions are still ongoing, that we're.
00:28:14.392 - 00:28:16.568, Speaker B: Running out of adults and warm bodies.
00:28:16.736 - 00:28:19.376, Speaker C: So to speak, to like make the.
00:28:19.400 - 00:28:28.752, Speaker B: Case on behalf of crypto. Like, I'm, it's kind of sad, to be honest with you, but I mean, if you just think of, like, all of the really big organizations that have had a fall from grace or that.
00:28:28.768 - 00:28:31.040, Speaker C: Are under some degree of pressure, it.
00:28:31.072 - 00:28:37.084, Speaker B: Really has been just a relentless barrage of bad press, underperformance, kind of broken trust.
00:28:37.204 - 00:28:38.092, Speaker C: And the only thing that I think.
00:28:38.108 - 00:28:39.164, Speaker B: Is going to heal that is time.
00:28:39.244 - 00:28:49.308, Speaker C: So we're actually arguably better off right now in engaging in a little bit of trench warfare and strategic retreat to.
00:28:49.396 - 00:28:52.036, Speaker B: Just regroup and hopefully just build our.
00:28:52.060 - 00:28:58.516, Speaker C: Way out of this. If you were to wave a wand and get policy solutions tomorrow, based on.
00:28:58.540 - 00:29:13.644, Speaker B: Our performance last year, I don't think that anyone would like them very much. So unfortunately, we probably are in a litigation and retrenchment phase that is going to last a couple of years. And frankly, I think it'll probably last through the presidential cycle in the US.
00:29:19.184 - 00:29:21.456, Speaker D: I think one of the questions that.
00:29:21.480 - 00:29:31.832, Speaker A: A lot of people have is what keeps you so hopeful about this? We've talked about a lot of the challenges and a lot of the difficulties, specifically with regulation and more mainstream adoption.
00:29:31.968 - 00:29:32.648, Speaker D: You're still here.
00:29:32.696 - 00:29:37.616, Speaker A: You've been here for a while. You're fighting a fight in DC. What keeps you hopeful about this?
00:29:37.720 - 00:29:55.184, Speaker C: Every time I use a product that works that people six months, a year, two years prior had said was ridiculous or was moon fumes or vaporware, there's just been countless examples of products, companies.
00:29:55.264 - 00:30:01.828, Speaker B: People that have been underestimated and then turned around and just wildly outperformed and built something that was transformative and really.
00:30:01.876 - 00:30:06.332, Speaker C: Important for the industry and something that was open source. Right?
00:30:06.388 - 00:30:06.668, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:06.716 - 00:30:09.244, Speaker B: So many times when there's like some.
00:30:09.284 - 00:30:10.636, Speaker C: Zero to one leap, it can be.
00:30:10.660 - 00:30:12.716, Speaker B: Used by anybody and then that is.
00:30:12.740 - 00:30:15.868, Speaker C: Like a new step on the staircase.
00:30:15.956 - 00:30:18.468, Speaker B: That people can climb and everybody can kind of climb and you can kind.
00:30:18.476 - 00:30:22.580, Speaker C: Of pull them along with you. That's really powerful in terms of the.
00:30:22.612 - 00:30:24.076, Speaker B: Momentum of the industry and like our.
00:30:24.140 - 00:30:25.976, Speaker C: Capacity to build and kind of move.
00:30:26.000 - 00:30:27.244, Speaker B: Things forward as an industry.
00:30:27.744 - 00:30:43.884, Speaker C: So you have a situation where Defi, NFTs, DAos, decentralized hardware networks, layer ones, L2s, bridges, these things did not exist four years ago.
00:30:44.424 - 00:30:45.592, Speaker B: None of them existed.
00:30:45.648 - 00:30:53.284, Speaker C: And if they did, it was by months, maybe. Uniswap Aave had just come off of their fundraiser. I dont actually remember when they launched.
00:30:53.834 - 00:30:59.226, Speaker B: Crypto punks were released, but then they were forgotten about for four years and then they resurge when everybody started speculating on them.
00:30:59.250 - 00:31:01.762, Speaker C: So I think now that those are.
00:31:01.778 - 00:31:08.762, Speaker B: Kind of mainstream and they're out of the bag now you're going to have the next crop of people that build around that and it's going to be the next crop of people that are.
00:31:08.778 - 00:31:10.938, Speaker C: Building things that either look like toys.
00:31:10.986 - 00:31:13.546, Speaker B: Or people say, this is never going to work, and here's why.
00:31:13.690 - 00:31:16.370, Speaker C: And then they're just going to chip away at the problem set and then.
00:31:16.442 - 00:31:17.538, Speaker B: You'Re going to have something in a.
00:31:17.546 - 00:31:21.004, Speaker C: Couple of years where, voila. All of a sudden something just works.
00:31:21.624 - 00:31:34.364, Speaker B: I'm sure you've done the same. The first Uniswap transaction, the first trustless bridge transaction that you do, minting an NFT. The NFT is that we have today, these pfps, frankly, I think they're stupid.
00:31:34.944 - 00:31:38.160, Speaker C: But they're really good statements of work.
00:31:38.272 - 00:31:45.944, Speaker B: I don't care about whether it's a bored ape or a penguin or a punk. I don't care about what the pixels are. I care about the fact that this.
00:31:45.984 - 00:31:53.922, Speaker C: Is something that is now out of the sandbox and people are starting to imagine use cases for far beyond what.
00:31:53.938 - 00:31:55.050, Speaker B: The v one looks like.
00:31:55.162 - 00:31:57.042, Speaker C: And part of it is I have.
00:31:57.058 - 00:31:59.890, Speaker B: The luxury of just having seen prior cycles.
00:32:00.042 - 00:32:01.650, Speaker C: And so I just have a lot.
00:32:01.682 - 00:32:04.282, Speaker B: More conviction about where the real risks are.
00:32:04.418 - 00:32:08.934, Speaker C: And to me, the real risks are not that this fizzles out, it's that it's stomped out.
00:32:09.554 - 00:32:10.994, Speaker B: And for that it would be because.
00:32:11.034 - 00:32:13.648, Speaker C: We made one too many blunders and.
00:32:13.736 - 00:32:18.924, Speaker B: Lost one too many, too many degrees of trust from a broader society level.
00:32:19.424 - 00:32:24.096, Speaker C: When I say build our way out of this, I think that building products.
00:32:24.200 - 00:32:27.960, Speaker B: That are going to be useful for society, it is an existential need right now.
00:32:28.032 - 00:32:28.480, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:28.592 - 00:32:32.128, Speaker A: Looking forward into that multi year time horizon, do you think crypto is going.
00:32:32.136 - 00:32:35.400, Speaker D: To be able to maintain its moral.
00:32:35.432 - 00:33:00.766, Speaker A: And ethical stance that it has today? I am consistently surprised that open source is still the standard, that interoperability is still the standard. I think if you go back to the early days of the API revolution, at the beginning of web two, there was this idea that websites would suddenly become open and interoperable because everyone would have an API and you could move data from one application to another.
00:33:00.950 - 00:33:03.406, Speaker D: A lot of that language, it feels.
00:33:03.430 - 00:33:07.446, Speaker A: Like it's back in crypto. It's very real in today's crypto.
00:33:07.590 - 00:33:09.702, Speaker D: But as this world expands and as.
00:33:09.718 - 00:33:21.366, Speaker A: It comes more mainstream, do you think that sort of ethical framework and moral framework can survive contact with a publicly traded company that has an incentive to maximally extract profit?
00:33:21.470 - 00:33:22.126, Speaker C: I think so.
00:33:22.230 - 00:33:24.114, Speaker B: And I think the transition will be.
00:33:24.534 - 00:33:27.206, Speaker C: It'Ll be slow at first, like slowly.
00:33:27.230 - 00:33:29.894, Speaker B: Then suddenly that sort of thing. So we haven't really hit the j.
00:33:29.934 - 00:33:35.892, Speaker C: Curve in terms of disruption for very large companies. But I think thats not going to.
00:33:35.908 - 00:33:41.892, Speaker B: Happen all at once. Itll be different pockets that happen. Bitcoin is not going to replace the US dollar, but it might very well.
00:33:41.908 - 00:33:45.324, Speaker C: Become a reserve for certain countries and.
00:33:45.444 - 00:33:48.900, Speaker B: Geopolitical issues where people either are disenfranchised.
00:33:48.972 - 00:33:52.156, Speaker C: Or their monetary system dont work, or.
00:33:52.180 - 00:34:06.030, Speaker B: Maybe itll be stable ones that are algorithmic or that are maybe outside of the US jurisdiction. So you know that youre going to have redeemability of them versus be subject to the search and seizure of some us authority.
00:34:06.062 - 00:34:09.982, Speaker C: If youre in Argentina and youre trying to use a stable coin, I think.
00:34:09.998 - 00:34:12.554, Speaker B: There are a lot of areas where.
00:34:13.134 - 00:34:15.958, Speaker C: Its not a foregone conclusion that crypto.
00:34:16.046 - 00:34:17.438, Speaker B: Is going to be successful.
00:34:17.606 - 00:34:20.262, Speaker C: But if people are able to build.
00:34:20.398 - 00:34:22.462, Speaker B: For target Personas in the right target.
00:34:22.518 - 00:34:26.198, Speaker C: Markets and were able to make iterative progress towards those goals.
00:34:26.246 - 00:34:29.614, Speaker B: I think it becomes too big to fail in certain regions or certain use.
00:34:29.654 - 00:34:33.066, Speaker C: Cases, and you just need to keep.
00:34:33.090 - 00:34:39.122, Speaker B: The fire going and the kindling going. You dont necessarily need it to turn into a complete inferno.
00:34:39.258 - 00:34:42.506, Speaker C: But when we do get to that point, its going to be because the.
00:34:42.530 - 00:34:44.534, Speaker B: Product is so good that nobody cares.
00:34:46.034 - 00:34:53.482, Speaker C: The blockbuster employees were really broken up when Netflix ate their lunch, but the blockbuster employees just went on, either worked.
00:34:53.498 - 00:35:06.376, Speaker B: At Netflix or went to another job. Barnes and Noble versus Amazon. This is the circle of life in terms of capitalism and invention and innovation in tech. I think that tech in crypto is.
00:35:06.400 - 00:35:13.432, Speaker C: Neutral, but ultimately, I'd argue there's a lot more area for human contributions and.
00:35:13.528 - 00:35:18.104, Speaker B: Development within crypto than something like AI, for instance. I think AI will be much more.
00:35:18.144 - 00:35:24.386, Speaker C: Disruptive to the workforce, the labor force, and to companies. And crypto will be.
00:35:24.410 - 00:35:30.146, Speaker B: I think crypto is more of like a slow, gradual integration and something that's ultimately additive and one in one is.
00:35:30.170 - 00:35:34.250, Speaker C: Three versus like truly creative destruction that.
00:35:34.282 - 00:35:38.482, Speaker B: We'Re going to see potentially in AI and some of the upgrades that that brings.
00:35:38.578 - 00:35:45.714, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really interesting because like, I think if you look back at the mobile transformation, like, mobile changed the ways.
00:35:45.794 - 00:35:48.922, Speaker D: That we interact with software, it changed.
00:35:48.938 - 00:35:54.522, Speaker A: Your expectation for software, it changed the way people date. It changed all sorts of things in our lives.
00:35:54.578 - 00:35:58.328, Speaker D: But like, one of those biggest ones is pre mobile.
00:35:58.416 - 00:36:01.376, Speaker A: You kind of had to be responsible for how you used the Internet.
00:36:01.480 - 00:36:02.392, Speaker D: You had to be careful you didn't.
00:36:02.408 - 00:36:13.496, Speaker A: Go to weird websites that installed all this weird crap on your computer. And there's still a little bit of that on desktops. But the assumption there in most mobile software now is either apple or Google.
00:36:13.560 - 00:36:15.880, Speaker D: Is responsible for your safety.
00:36:15.992 - 00:36:21.434, Speaker A: They're mediating your experience with the Internet by having built mobile in a fundamentally different way.
00:36:21.624 - 00:36:22.790, Speaker D: But then you compare that to something.
00:36:22.822 - 00:36:34.622, Speaker A: Like an electric car, and for all teslas shine. An electric f 150 is basically the same as an f 150. Yeah, you charge it as opposed to putting gas in it. But fundamentally, the experience of using a.
00:36:34.638 - 00:36:38.310, Speaker D: Pickup truck is not radically different since its electric.
00:36:38.502 - 00:36:43.790, Speaker A: Where do you think crypto falls on that spectrum? It sounds like maybe you view it as a little bit more of a.
00:36:43.822 - 00:36:47.654, Speaker D: Backend, innovative technology that doesnt necessarily change.
00:36:47.774 - 00:36:52.118, Speaker A: That paradigm of how software is built, but just changes underlying how it works.
00:36:52.166 - 00:37:05.718, Speaker C: Is that accurate? Little bit more than like the swapping out the engine? I think it's probably closer to like mobile because it's going to unlock new use cases as well. But just because mobile applications versus desktop.
00:37:05.766 - 00:37:08.910, Speaker B: Applications didn't change like it just expanded.
00:37:08.982 - 00:37:12.914, Speaker C: The universe of tech and expanded the number of things that you could do.
00:37:13.334 - 00:37:15.062, Speaker B: I think crypto is similar.
00:37:15.118 - 00:37:17.102, Speaker C: Like yes, you're swapping out the backend.
00:37:17.158 - 00:37:19.326, Speaker B: And some of the accounting system and.
00:37:19.350 - 00:37:21.844, Speaker C: Settlement system, but there's also so many.
00:37:21.884 - 00:37:23.084, Speaker B: Other things you can do with smart.
00:37:23.124 - 00:37:25.356, Speaker C: Contracts that are going to unlock a.
00:37:25.380 - 00:37:30.876, Speaker B: Whole universe of things that either weren't possible before that we didn't really imagine would be possible before.
00:37:31.060 - 00:37:33.820, Speaker C: I still think just creating scarce digital.
00:37:33.892 - 00:37:36.304, Speaker B: Assets, whether they're fungible or non fungible.
00:37:36.604 - 00:37:52.214, Speaker C: Is something that hasn't really seeped in in terms of its importance to society at large. And I think that's something that in decades in the future will be extremely obvious in hindsight. But right now it's still like, okay.
00:37:52.254 - 00:38:00.958, Speaker B: You can create scarcity of jpegs, but what does that really mean? And for me the answer is, well, you could modularize your identity and your reputation system and the data and ip.
00:38:01.006 - 00:38:03.238, Speaker C: That you have and permission it out.
00:38:03.366 - 00:38:12.714, Speaker B: To whoever you want, whenever you want, and you ultimately control it versus being susceptible of being unpersoned by an unfriendly tech giant or state actor.
00:38:13.164 - 00:38:16.148, Speaker C: Thats very powerful. And yes, theres going to be a.
00:38:16.156 - 00:38:35.284, Speaker B: Lot of value that will be unlocked there at scale, even if its not all at once. And then obviously I think with fungible currencies its a little bit more straightforward because some people have bought into the bitcoin meme and I hate saying were still so early and people are like, oh, were in 1994. I think a lot of those comparisons are bullshit.
00:38:35.404 - 00:38:38.292, Speaker C: And one of the reasons I say that is I feel like weve got.
00:38:38.308 - 00:38:46.898, Speaker B: A lot of overlapping hype cycles right now. Like to use like the Gartner curve that everybody always talks about or the tech installation curve.
00:38:47.066 - 00:38:50.546, Speaker C: You've got bitcoin on one cycle, you've.
00:38:50.570 - 00:38:54.266, Speaker B: Got Ethereum and layer ones and smart contract platforms on another cycle. And then you've got a lot of.
00:38:54.290 - 00:39:02.242, Speaker C: Applications that are all on like related but slightly different parts of their curve. And I'd argue like something like Defi.
00:39:02.338 - 00:39:04.874, Speaker B: Defi summer was like way back in 2020.
00:39:04.994 - 00:39:09.200, Speaker C: Nfts were only hot. Like beginning of last year really is.
00:39:09.232 - 00:39:17.112, Speaker B: When they started to hit scale. Youve got an 18 month lag there. Youve got the same thing with these layer ones versus Ethereum and L2.
00:39:17.128 - 00:39:19.432, Speaker C: S. I feel like were going to.
00:39:19.448 - 00:39:25.032, Speaker B: Continue to see areas of interest and heat mapping across cycles from now on.
00:39:25.168 - 00:39:27.960, Speaker C: And things will start to be slightly.
00:39:27.992 - 00:39:30.224, Speaker B: Less correlated with each progressing cycle.
00:39:30.344 - 00:39:48.160, Speaker A: Looking forward, what are some technologies or projects that you've been following that you feel are really going to come into their own in 2023? And what are some technologies that people are sort of just starting to talk about, or sort of are just on the testnet phase that you think we'll be hearing more about in 2023?
00:39:48.272 - 00:39:56.232, Speaker B: So I'm really excited about Defi dpend Desoc, we call them. So DeFi, everybody knows.
00:39:56.408 - 00:40:01.048, Speaker C: My quick and dirty for DeFi is if we can avoid the worst case scenarios.
00:40:01.096 - 00:40:11.136, Speaker B: On the regulatory front, DeFi's market cap is like $15 billion or something. Not even, it's like twelve or $13 billion collectively as an industry, JPMorgan is 400 billion.
00:40:11.320 - 00:40:14.536, Speaker C: Right. So if you're thinking about financial services.
00:40:14.680 - 00:40:20.368, Speaker B: As like 20% to 25% of the global economy, and the things that DeFi can unlock and the rents that it.
00:40:20.376 - 00:40:29.526, Speaker C: Can eviscerate at scale, I still think it's such a transformative component of the industry and one of the primary things.
00:40:29.550 - 00:40:33.470, Speaker B: That we can build around to build a better global financial system.
00:40:33.662 - 00:40:38.110, Speaker C: Decentralized physical infrastructure networks are, I think, the glue.
00:40:38.302 - 00:40:49.798, Speaker B: Not the glue, I'd say more like the steel foundation that we need. And you guys know this firsthand with Hertzner, how do you pronounce it? Hetzner yeah, the rug pull from one.
00:40:49.806 - 00:40:58.024, Speaker C: Of the biggest data centers in Europe, basically saying crypto is not welcome here. Well, you know what? AWS says that we sure ship better.
00:40:58.064 - 00:41:02.472, Speaker B: Have a decentralized hardware network thats going to be able to run some of these applications.
00:41:02.648 - 00:41:05.328, Speaker C: And weve got to start scaling that up. Same thing.
00:41:05.456 - 00:41:09.040, Speaker B: Five $6 trillion in cloud computing is the market size.
00:41:09.192 - 00:41:11.896, Speaker C: Its about $3 billion collectively for the.
00:41:11.920 - 00:41:15.272, Speaker B: Market capitalization of decentralized physical infrastructure networks.
00:41:15.288 - 00:41:17.680, Speaker C: Or deepen, do you think that its.
00:41:17.712 - 00:41:21.840, Speaker B: Going to be more or less than ten basis points of the global cloud computing infrastructure?
00:41:21.872 - 00:41:23.936, Speaker C: I think the answer is, is almost.
00:41:23.960 - 00:41:27.992, Speaker B: Certainly going to be more when you think about censorship issues and geopolitical concerns.
00:41:28.168 - 00:41:31.712, Speaker C: And then I think decentralized social, just.
00:41:31.808 - 00:41:43.184, Speaker B: The current web, the browsing experience, the mobile operating systems and then the web, two social giants, I think are all absolutely things that could be built around.
00:41:43.224 - 00:41:46.160, Speaker C: And upgraded, but with a user centric.
00:41:46.312 - 00:41:53.416, Speaker B: Approach versus a platform and single application centric approach. So I really like what forecaster and.
00:41:53.440 - 00:41:56.872, Speaker C: Lens and some of these crypto native.
00:41:57.048 - 00:41:59.536, Speaker B: Decentralized social networks are starting to build.
00:41:59.600 - 00:42:07.096, Speaker C: And those truly are just getting into the batters box. So bitcoin, maybe its in the third inning, its not in the first.
00:42:07.200 - 00:42:20.712, Speaker B: Bitcoins maybe in the third inning. Ethereum maybe in the second inning. Maybe you guys in the other layer. Ones are top of the second or bottom the first. But things like decentralized social and decentralized hardware networks, theyre literally first pitch stage.
00:42:20.848 - 00:42:24.724, Speaker C: Thats what keeps me excited. And I continue to be as long.
00:42:24.764 - 00:42:25.900, Speaker B: Term bullish as I've ever been.
00:42:25.932 - 00:42:29.708, Speaker C: We just need to not get shut down and we gotta, you know, we.
00:42:29.716 - 00:42:30.964, Speaker B: Gotta self police a little bit better.
00:42:31.004 - 00:42:32.964, Speaker C: So that people can't, you know, torch.
00:42:33.004 - 00:42:36.908, Speaker B: Our reputation after latching on for a couple of years of exploitation.
00:42:36.996 - 00:42:37.692, Speaker C: Love it.
00:42:37.828 - 00:42:39.972, Speaker D: I'm feeling good about this year, I have to say.
00:42:40.028 - 00:42:49.744, Speaker A: I think a lot of the fundamental investments that folks across multiple chains and industries have made through the start of a bear market in 2022, I think we're, we're really gonna see.
00:42:49.884 - 00:42:58.752, Speaker D: This is probably the best shot on goal we've had as an industry for 2023 and we'll see if we make it this year. Maybe it's next year, but hope so. Be good to see.
00:42:58.928 - 00:43:01.896, Speaker A: Well, Ryan, thanks for joining us today. This was a great conversation.
00:43:02.080 - 00:43:08.484, Speaker B: Likewise. And best of luck to you guys, the whole community. And let's get back to work.
