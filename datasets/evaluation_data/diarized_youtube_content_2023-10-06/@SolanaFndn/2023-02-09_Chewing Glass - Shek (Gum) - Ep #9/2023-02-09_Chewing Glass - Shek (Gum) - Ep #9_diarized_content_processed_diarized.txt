00:00:00.600 - 00:00:02.582, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other, we're not gonna make it.
00:00:02.678 - 00:00:12.886, Speaker B: Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew. Most of the time, I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life. A face full of glass hurts like hell when you're in it.
00:00:12.950 - 00:00:14.798, Speaker A: That's weird. That glass looks half full to me.
00:00:14.846 - 00:00:17.198, Speaker B: Eating glass. Eating glass and staring into the abyss.
00:00:17.326 - 00:00:18.114, Speaker A: Glass.
00:00:18.734 - 00:00:20.254, Speaker B: Who gives a shit about glass?
00:00:20.334 - 00:00:21.594, Speaker A: Who the fuck is this?
00:00:22.934 - 00:00:26.074, Speaker B: It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass.
00:00:27.054 - 00:00:29.434, Speaker A: Gotta get some safety goggles next time.
00:00:38.454 - 00:00:53.766, Speaker B: Hey, everybody, and welcome to Chewing glass, the show where we talk to developers building in the Solana ecosystem. Today I have a very special guest, shek, super team member, founder of word so club, and just all around great guy and glass chewer. How's it going, Shaq?
00:00:53.950 - 00:00:57.594, Speaker A: Hey, Chase. Super excited to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:00:58.034 - 00:01:24.454, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. You and I have. We've known each other for probably roughly over a year at this point. Like, when I first started my sort of developer advocacy journey, you were there answering my questions. You were part of this little sort of pseudo part time developer advocacy team together. So, like, it's really great to have you here. As you probably know if you've watched the show, we really like to start out about just sort of hearing your journey.
00:01:24.454 - 00:01:35.264, Speaker B: And the very first question that I like to ask is, what were you were doing before you got into web3? Where does your engineering sort of route start?
00:01:35.644 - 00:02:01.294, Speaker A: Yeah, so before web3, I've been, like, building a variety of systems for well over a decade. So I worked across the stack from building distributor training infrastructures to data pipeline to databases. So, yeah, it's like a wide variety of experience over a period of, like, eight, nine years.
00:02:02.234 - 00:02:06.882, Speaker B: Yeah, so, eight, nine years. And then what languages were you working in throughout that time?
00:02:07.018 - 00:02:09.094, Speaker A: Mostly python and Golang.
00:02:09.794 - 00:02:37.078, Speaker B: Python and Golang? Yeah. Well, you've come a long way. Now you're chewing glass with rust and anchor. And what's the biggest difference between, for you, working in python and go lang and working on some of this machine learning and all these other things, and now switching over to working on rust? Is there something that just sticks out to you that really comes to mind?
00:02:37.206 - 00:03:40.534, Speaker A: I think the rust has a really good type system. Aside from all of this, I'm a huge, functional programming nerd, so I really like to geek out about programs as, like, programs as types, as math equations. So that even though rust is not like a very, very. Rust is definitely very, very far away from Haskell in that kind of construction, but Rust still gets a job done. It's like some kind of a best of both worlds where you get your type safety, memory safety, and also you get performance. So I really like that aspect of rust. So before I came into web3, I was like, I had a little bit of downtime and I was, you know, building toy compilers on my, during my free time, so that's kind of how I got interested.
00:03:40.634 - 00:04:10.934, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, I know. I've seen you champion it. I've seen you like in the earlier days, you were one of the, one of the few amount of people out there that were publicly talking about how much you love rust and all that, but to keep going in that sort of lane. What was your outside of engineering? Outside of everything? When and what was your first experience in crypto? Was it related to just buying your first bitcoin? Did you like, what was your first experience there?
00:04:11.794 - 00:04:55.714, Speaker A: Yeah, I read the bitcoin paper when I was in, when I was in college, but then I looked at it as a, wow, this is like a very interesting way to solve a distributed systems problem. Right. But then and beyond that, I never really took it seriously as an industry or never imagined that it would grow as I guess it has come to be today. And, yeah, I mean, during the course, whenever I could buy some crypto, I just apron to it and bought some shit. But beyond that, I never really believed or thought that, you know, that this would become this gigantic, you know, force that it is today.
00:04:56.614 - 00:06:13.136, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, same, like, I think I probably heard about it in like at one of my engineering jobs and maybe like, like for real, for real whenever, maybe like 2014 or something like that and didn't really do much. And then probably around 2017, I ended up buying my first coin on Coinbase, which was Ethereum and a very similar experience. Like, I was just like, I was an engineer, I read the white paper, I was like, yeah, I don't really know what this thing is, but like, I might as well like play around with in case something works out, but I wish I would have done it a little bit earlier. So, yeah, so that's your first experience, like, with crypto, but like, what was your sort of evolution from there? Like, you sort of just said you, you were in college, you read the white paper, you didn't really know what the future was. Like degend on some coins early on, but like, what was the, what was the evolution from there in terms of, like, how did you sort of get a little more baked into the industry, was it like a slow progression or did this start more recently? And it was sort of, like, all at once, and then you are. You're in NNL, but, like, just, like, leading up to Solana but not beyond that. Like, what was your progression? And, like, in, like, development side of web3 or getting involved in the space outside of just, like, buying some coins?
00:06:13.320 - 00:06:46.938, Speaker A: Yeah. So for me, I came to web3 because I was super bored. Like, in 2020, I was an early employee at startup, and we ended up getting acquired. And so once you go from, like, a very hectic and focused thing to an exit where you all of a sudden turns out you have, like, a ton of free time. Right. So I was just looking, looking at what is happening, and then that's. That's when I think Tanmay and Nakshay started their suit then super pump podcast.
00:06:46.938 - 00:07:18.054, Speaker A: So I used to be here. I was listening and looking at them like, oh, my God, this. All of this is happening. Right. Uh, so that's when I also. And also that's when I saw the newer applications of crypto that, that were coming out. So, yeah, so I imagine I set up, like, then unknown Twitter account, and then I start just posting and seeing what people are up to.
00:07:18.054 - 00:07:38.308, Speaker A: So one thing led to another, one thing led to another, and I start hanging out in the super theme discord. So it's kind of, it's mostly been like a happy accident from me hanging out on Twitter, you know, me being super, super bored, figuring out what to do next.
00:07:38.476 - 00:08:11.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess, like, I can't remember our first engagement. I'm pretty sure that, like, I happened to see you on, on Twitter somehow. I mean, in those early days, I was probably one of the few people just sort of, like, tweeting about super team all the time. I was one of the few people that knew what it was, even though, like, I'm not sure super team actually knew what they were in those early days. But, like, that's really cool to hear that, like, that Akshay and Tanmei were the. Were the ones that sort of, like, grabbed your attention. So I guess that means as a developer, you're Solana native.
00:08:11.070 - 00:08:14.934, Speaker B: Like, you had never, like, been building on solidity or any of the other chains.
00:08:15.014 - 00:08:50.333, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I'm this archetype of web two engineer who looks at things that he really likes and then just jumps right into Solana, which I think is becoming largely the case. A lot of this experienced engineers will have, like, 1012 years of experience to look at Solana and look at oh, my God. This is, like, very well thought out. And this is probably how I would design something, like pitta teeth, too scale, and then they look at all the design decisions and start falling in love with it.
00:08:51.193 - 00:09:20.514, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean, like, early on when I, like, I was pretty new, too, and, like, still trying to understand, like, sort of, like, how Solana worked. And I even relied on you for a lot of my information and sort of sort of get your feedback on, like, how things looked and, like. And what problems that needed to be solved. And, like, those were really helpful days for me. Like, you were actually, like, a pretty. Pretty big mentor for me just to help understand some of these concepts, like, you working in the sort of systems you had before, you had a lot of knowledge, and, like, it was really helpful.
00:09:20.514 - 00:09:53.084, Speaker B: I definitely want to talk a little bit more about. And I speak about them on podcasts that I join and even on the show briefly, but I want to talk a little bit more about, like, super team and your role within that sort of organization and group, like. Cause I know the super team literally just started out as. As a discord. Didn't really have much of an identity outside of this, like, group of people that, like, liked Solana and were starting to contribute in certain ways. But, like, how. So you said you were hanging out in the super team discord.
00:09:53.084 - 00:10:02.344, Speaker B: Like, what were you doing? And then, like, how did that sort of roll within that. Within that group progress for you? So you're one of the ogs, from what I understand there.
00:10:02.384 - 00:10:37.392, Speaker A: So, yeah, so, I mean, I was just hanging out there like everybody else was hanging out. Right. So when I was there, like, a lot of this really young engineers who are trying to. Well, Solana had their attention because both, you know, the podcast itself has, like, a tremendous amount of distribution. So naturally, that means that the people gravitated towards it. And then there was this whole Instagram pipeline that was pushing people to build things on Solana. But then a lot of it was also at a time where the one people didn't really understand Solana.
00:10:37.392 - 00:10:57.892, Speaker A: So building on top of Solana were. They didn't really know what to do. People would get, like, stuck all the time. So I would. I was anyway, bored at my job, right? So I would hang out on the discord, like, help solve some of these blockers that people would run into. So that's. That's pretty much how.
00:10:57.892 - 00:11:15.090, Speaker A: What I was. I was doing. And then that. That's also kind of what led me to writing some. Okay. Turns out people do not understand the accounts model Silvana gets used to get a lot of flack for. This is, like, a very completely different way to write smart contracts.
00:11:15.090 - 00:11:39.614, Speaker A: Right? So how do we even go about it? And on top of that, people found. So that's the accounts oriented programming order. And on top of that, people used to get tripped up over PDF a lot. So I was like, okay, fine, let me create content around it so that people actually find it useful. And I do not have to keep telling the same thing to people over and over again.
00:11:40.344 - 00:12:01.640, Speaker B: Yeah. And I know, like, eventually, super team sort of created, like, in order to join. Like, there was a proof of work thing where, like, go out here and, like, do an Instagram, and now you can be part of super team. And, like, I think it was a really smart. It was a really smart thing to do. And. And I don't know if everybody really understands this, and I don't know the exact number, but in the early days, when I was speaking with superteam and.
00:12:01.640 - 00:12:58.820, Speaker B: And the devrel team sort of came up with the idea for the Solana cookbook, because our core documentation was just super heavy and dense. Didn't necessarily teach you how to build on Solana. So Jacob and the rest of the Devrel team sort of crafted this idea for something called a Solana cookbook, which is, like, light explainers, reference implement, or, like, code snippets to just, like, allow people to speed up their development. And Arkshea, who was one of the originators of that, like, created this thing called a glass eater. NFT pushed that into super team. And superteam at the time, probably wrote 90, let's say, between 70 and 90% of the Solana cookbook, which really was, like, one of the original sort of, like, starting points were like, okay, we're gonna do this, and we're gonna scale through the community. People start contributing, and that flywheel starts spinning, and it really turned into, like, something amazing.
00:12:58.820 - 00:13:31.304, Speaker B: And, like, long story short, super Team India became so successful that they became, like, I believe, the number two submitters to our global hackathon because of a lot of the work superteam has done. And now we have super team Germany out there. There's a super team Vietnam and a super team turkey, and, like, these sort of, like, autonomous organizations that are just, like, working within their own regions to do some really cool stuff. Do you have any. Do you have any sort of, like, touch points or get a chance to talk to these super teams outside of the ones in India?
00:13:31.604 - 00:14:07.876, Speaker A: Not. Not really. I have probably interacted with, like, a few people. A couple of days ago, I indeed, during the community, call this Chris Oyakaro from super team Germany. He was talking, when he was giving the updates, he was talking about this. This new wallet, which then this new wallet that they funded on Instagram, for which. Which acts as kind of like a TOTP or player, so that before any of your transaction would go through, you have to enter an OTP so that your transaction actually goes to.
00:14:07.876 - 00:14:27.220, Speaker A: Right. So it's an added layer of security that they built. I thought that was a very cool idea. So I spoke to. I spoke to the guy who was building it. So outside of that, I haven't really had much interaction with anyone outside of, like, any of the new super teams. But I think that's expanding globally is, like, a freaking cool idea.
00:14:27.220 - 00:15:00.634, Speaker A: And we have a model that worked in India, so now you have to just take the playbook and replicate it across multiple geographies. Right. I'm super excited for this year's series of Hacker houses, because earlier, you know, we had all the hacker. Hacker houses in India had a strong super team presence, so now we have super team, which is much more global. Right. So I'm super excited for the hacker houses and Turkey and also in Vietnam and.
00:15:00.974 - 00:15:40.668, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, same here. And, like, also, like, the super teams have been able to produce some really strong projects. And before I get into that, specifically about you and sort of, like, where you are right now, I wanted to ask this question, because I always like to ask this question to all the guests on here is, like, I think I might already know the answer, because, like, a lot of these things we're talking about lead up to it. But, like, you came in here, like, it was really hard to build on Solana. A lot of people were having trouble. Like, we got a lot of slack. Like, it was just, like, a time where, like, nobody thought that anybody had a chance outside of EVM, but you were like, hey, I like this design.
00:15:40.668 - 00:15:53.668, Speaker B: Rust is pretty damn cool. I'm going to stick around. So, like, what made you stay? Like, what was. What's the reason that you're still here on Solana today? Like, what's the reason behind it?
00:15:53.836 - 00:16:20.500, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I know it's going to sound a little cliche when I answer this, but it's like, I came for the tech and stayed for the community. Uh, the kind of camaraderie. The kind of camaraderie you get with so many people, like, building on Solana is, like, unparalleled. I also, from. From my personal perspective, since Solana. I first came to Solana, right? I'm like, native to Solana.
00:16:20.500 - 00:16:34.884, Speaker A: I haven't worked on any other blockchain store. It's not something that I. I mean, I do understand the technology of whatever they are intimately, but then it's not. That's not an ecosystem I'm plugged into. Like, I'm plugged into Solana.
00:16:35.344 - 00:17:18.280, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough. And I mean, like, I think every blockchain has their native sort of developers that haven't really gone outside of that, but, like, that sort of came for the text, stayed for the community, or stayed for the vibes is like something we hear pretty much every single time on the show. And I do truly believe that we have one of the strongest developer communities out there. Also, the new electric Capital report came out, and we are the second strongest developer community next to Ethereum, which was really awesome to see, considering a lot of the world was seeing some false reports that only 75 devs existed on Solana, which became a meme, and then all got proven wrong in a single moment, which was really, I think it was fun for a lot of us to play around with that.
00:17:18.432 - 00:17:24.524, Speaker A: I thought each one of us is equal to, I don't know, 100 devs.
00:17:27.724 - 00:18:18.104, Speaker B: Well, yeah, man. So we talked about your sort of intro into web3 and a little bit about super team and your evolution and sort of why you're still here. So I do want to talk a little bit more about sort of shek and that sort of after super team, you're there, you're helping out, you're doing all this cool stuff, I guess then you got inspired to be like, hey, I want to build this new cool thing which was birthed word so club, which originally and naturally was a social blogging platform. I know there's other plans. I know there's other information. I'll sort of let you speak to what that original idea for word sale was, and then what's the evolution of that look like for you? And why is this important for something that you're building right now?
00:18:18.684 - 00:19:26.178, Speaker A: Yeah. Words has a very interesting story in the sense that so lot of it started because I was creating content on Solana, right? When I was writing all this stuff, it kind of, it felt really weird to me that my only options were substack or medium. So I really wanted my blog to be on Solana because, I mean, I was writing about Solana, right? So that's how it kind of got started. And turns out a lot of other projects in the community also needed something like this. They would love to use a blogging tool that is native to Savannah. So over the course of building something like this, I realized that the underlying structure we ended up creating captured everything that you need to build any kind of decentralized social media application. And to me, this realization also happened around, just around the time the one riptide and winning riptide also kind of made.
00:19:26.178 - 00:20:19.950, Speaker A: Okay, fine. Now it's a bunch of people that I like. That is a community that I like. Maybe it's time for me to think seriously about it and go full time web3, and I go full time web3, and then we set up a company, raise some funds, and then, like, actually take the product to main net. So now, having been. Having been there for quite a bit of time and super excited about, super excited about how Solana is evolving, super pumped about account compression. So we are leveraging account compression to build this whole, you know, this entire social media protocol which would allow you to keep all of your social data for life for the, you know, the.
00:20:19.950 - 00:20:22.714, Speaker A: For the cost of a pack of gum.
00:20:23.614 - 00:20:45.492, Speaker B: Yeah. So I know you and I have talked about this. Like, you're building out these social primitives. Like, a funny story about, like, when. When I first, like, signed up and eventually used word. So I made a blog post and I think all it said was, this is a blog. And I actually trended to the very top of the trending section, probably because I shared all of my twitter, but that was always just a funny story.
00:20:45.492 - 00:21:10.504, Speaker B: So you're building out right now, you're building out social primitives and word soul. And I think you just alluded to a different name here, but you're building out social primitives. And obviously word soul. And this new thing, it's not just a blogging platform. Like, what is it? And what is this new sort of big news that everybody should know about?
00:21:10.844 - 00:21:31.960, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's how I think about it. Right so far, we have had money legos. Money legos are what kickstart the whole defi. But then in order for this whole decently social to kick off, we need social legos. And what we are building gum is social legos on Solana. So that.
00:21:31.960 - 00:22:08.568, Speaker A: And then when you start unpeeling, what gum is in its actual. What gum enables is to. It enables devs to build sticky apps. Today, if you go to any crypto app, it feels like it's very. It's not a very consumer friendly experience or a very user friendly experience. If you want to get to a point where there are actually billion users who are using it. I keep coming back to this analogy, analogy where if they're going to be a billion users who are using crypto products, then my definitely is going to include my mom.
00:22:08.568 - 00:22:32.360, Speaker A: Will my mom use whatever we are building today in its current form? Maybe. No. Will she keep coming back to it? Probably not. Because we are taking this approach where we tie everything to a wallet. We think about it as wallets interacting with protocols. But we need to take. Take a step back and look at it.
00:22:32.360 - 00:23:10.646, Speaker A: That's like people interacting with apps. And that is what a lot of the applications that are getting built today misses. And with gum on top of the social primitives that exist, we also want to provide these drop in SDKs and components that would allow anyone to build on, build these sticky experiences right into their crypto app, for example. Right. And these are, for example, now hyperspace. Introduce a social feed. And the reason they introduce a social feed is that.
00:23:10.646 - 00:23:13.434, Speaker A: That keeps people coming back to hyperspace.
00:23:13.894 - 00:23:14.874, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:23:15.374 - 00:23:22.962, Speaker A: So with whatever we are building, any app can just plug in that kind of an experience.
00:23:23.158 - 00:23:43.054, Speaker B: Cool. So I want to ask. I have to ask, like, two things. One, why did you choose to call this gum? Does this have anything to do with chewing glass meme of building on Solana? And now chewing gum, like, you're making it easier for people to build social primitives? Or is it something completely different?
00:23:43.474 - 00:24:09.240, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's really one. I'm personally a huge comedic. I probably, you know, chill through entire pack in a couple of days. That's a very personal reason. But beyond that, yeah, it's like one, it's the social glue. It's the social legos on Solana, then on top of that gum, because it helps you build sticky apps.
00:24:09.240 - 00:24:46.538, Speaker A: And. And then beyond. Beyond that gum, because, well, people should not be chewing glass when they can build things as easily like they are chewing gums. Right. And even at the core of it, gum, because this is largely inspired by, you know, a corn compression, which is bubble gum and gummy roll. So it's all kind of, it's like a representation of all of that. And that kind of, that's a name that spoke to all the different aspects of things that we want to accomplish.
00:24:46.706 - 00:25:24.004, Speaker B: I feel like sometimes a lot of thought doesn't go into names, but to basically make a three letter word sort of encompass everything that sort of makes sense to you is actually really cool. So I guess I want to poke back to this, and we talked about starting out as a blogging platform and building out social primitives. But I think just for the listeners specifically, you're not only just building social primitives that people can use, you're building a product yourself. So could you just like, briefly describe like gum in its sort of final form?
00:25:24.344 - 00:27:04.324, Speaker A: Yeah. So right now we have one marquee product, which is a blogging platform, right? So in order to, if you look, if you have used word server, a lot of careful design went into building the product. If you probably hide the fact, hide the connect wallet button, it looks like any webdo app and it looks like anybody can just come in and use it. And that also allowed us to build a very sticky experience, very user friendly experience with gum, what we want to do is we want to unpack all these individual tools that we built and start open sourcing them and making it available for other application developers to use so that they also can build the sticky experiences into their application. So I look at a protocol as a public code. So when any of these applications integrate and make their experiences better, it also brings their profile and their connections, all the content that they create onto the protocol. So we are not gonna, you know, bring out, break away from the existing network effects on Instagram and Twitter by building a competing product, but by having these small individual apps which inherently want to provide better user experience and sticky user experience by means of having these social profiles, by means of having this activity feeds.
00:27:04.324 - 00:27:47.362, Speaker A: Something as simple as, for example when. This is one of my favorite examples in the web tour world. Right, let's look at Spotify. Spotify is a streaming service, but then they do have this concept of profile where you can go and create your playlist, you can follow your friends, and then you can, that is an activity feed of all what songs your friends are listening to. This kind of an experience makes the app itself sticky. If you're building anything that is targeted at the masses, we cannot go down the path where, you know, we keep looking at it as wallets, interacting with protocols, but we need to start looking at it as applications. You know, people interacting with applications.
00:27:47.362 - 00:27:50.694, Speaker A: And that requires a completely different approach.
00:27:51.314 - 00:28:27.448, Speaker B: Yeah, people interacting with applications and people interacting with people because like, inherently people want to be social. And if you don't give them that sort of social aspect, it's sort of just like this, like stagnant, like non living thing that you just sort of like robotically interact with. So that social layer is going to be super important, I think, for the future of web3 in general. And like, luckily, Solana has the speed and scale and the fees that allow this to be possible. So hopefully one day we can get. Hopefully one day we can get your mom on there and make sure that she's able to use this without too much of an issue.
00:28:27.636 - 00:28:36.764, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely, man. Saga, phone, backpack, and then apps using gum. I think that's, like, the killer combo right there.
00:28:37.224 - 00:29:03.718, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah. So shifting a little bit out about, like, what side, what. What you've been up to and what you've been personally building. Like, I have a series of questions I always like to ask people, because if we're gonna grow this ecosystem and make it better, we sort of have to be pretty honest with ourselves. So, like, what sucks about building on Solana? Like, what for you is the most sort of, like, frustrating thing right now that could have a solution.
00:29:03.886 - 00:29:28.640, Speaker A: Yeah. So one thing about Solana is that, like, just, like, chain, the development activity is also, like, so fast. There's just a ton of new projects, a ton of new activity that is happening. Right. So for the past couple of weeks, I've just been, like, neck deep into the whole account compression ecosystem. And so. So that's what I am working on right now.
00:29:28.640 - 00:29:45.424, Speaker A: But. And I enjoy, like, I enjoy doing grass, so it's. It's okay. It's something that I like. But then there's a lot of people who don't even know that. You know, things like account compression and then this new version transaction address. Look at people.
00:29:45.424 - 00:30:20.094, Speaker A: And a whole bunch of new, new local free markets like Solana devs have been shipping at, like, an insane rate. Right. A lot of people just do not know about that. I think we are at this point where there's a ton of things that are happening, but then a lot of this is not documented or even discoverable by people outside of our. Outside of our bubble. I think as an ecosystem, we should put a lot more emphasis on one getting. Getting a lot of this word out.
00:30:20.094 - 00:30:34.734, Speaker A: Rich. I mean, the fire dancer team and Richard are doing, like, great job and putting down. Putting down all of the specs, and then a lot of this is available on GitHub today. Right. But then that's, like, we have a long way to go from here.
00:30:35.514 - 00:30:55.686, Speaker B: Yeah, you. I mean, like, that's an interesting answer. You didn't, like, point to, like, a specific pain point on building, which I actually really like, because this is a little bit different of a conversation. It's more about, like, awareness. Probably throw, like, standards in there a little bit. I know there's a lot of conversations around standardizing things. Like, like, everybody eventually should agree on the standards for social.
00:30:55.686 - 00:31:24.832, Speaker B: On Solana. Like, we still haven't even officially agreed on the standards of nfts on Solana. There's lots of conversations, and, like, those need to not only exist, but they need to be available and awareness and a place for any new dev that's coming onto this chain to be like, ah, there it is. There are. There's all the standards. They're documented, and I can understand them easily. And, like, it's just easy to make sure that, yeah, I think awareness around these things is a huge thing, because otherwise you're like, I'm going to build on Solana.
00:31:24.832 - 00:32:01.994, Speaker B: Okay, where the hell do I start? I need to go start reading. Like, where do I go? So there's like, we're probably 100 times better than we were when I started at Solana, but we need to go a thousand times beyond that to get to where we need to be. So I think that was a really good answer. So what the next question is, like, what's good about building on Solano? Like, what makes. What makes your life easier? Or, like, what is something that's sort of like, a main benefit outside of, like, the fast and cheap and stuff, like, the actual building style? Like, what is good about Solana?
00:32:02.174 - 00:32:05.410, Speaker A: I'm not. I'm not sure whether people would agree with me on this, but the tooling.
00:32:05.442 - 00:32:07.194, Speaker B: That's okay. That's fine.
00:32:07.354 - 00:32:25.114, Speaker A: The tooling is actually good. Anchor is. I like using anchor even though I could. I'm even. Even though I'm totally okay writing things in native rust. Anchors. Anchor is really good.
00:32:25.114 - 00:32:36.786, Speaker A: And a lot of people like using it. I like using it. Whatever. You would take, like, a week to build a native rush, you can probably build it in a weekend with anchor. Right?
00:32:36.930 - 00:32:44.214, Speaker B: So you're saying that, like, what's good about building on Solana is just like, having anchor as, like, a new tool. Is this pretty much what you're saying?
00:32:44.794 - 00:32:45.574, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:46.154 - 00:33:15.014, Speaker B: All right, so we've gone through a lot. We've gone through your journey. We've gone through your experience in super team founding word soul. Now we're renaming it to gum. And we're going to basically build out these social primitives and make sure that future developers can socialize their apps and everybody has a lot more information and the ability to do that, which makes me super excited. I've been a huge advocate from day one of, like, nfts are great. Defi is insanely important.
00:33:15.014 - 00:33:58.444, Speaker B: As we've seen over this past year, some really negative things have happened in the market from centralized exchanges that impacted a lot of people. So Defi is also important, Dallas are going to be important as they sort of mature. But I've always sort of been banging in the drum about, like, we need to really look into more, like, like, some of these web two use cases, getting them onto Solana, but only if they make sense. Like, it's not like we don't need to bring a web two app, like, blogging platform on onto on chain unless there's a real reason for that. And, like, there's a lot of reasons for these sorts of things. So I'm excited that you're, like, really passionate and focused and, like, you got a team now and you're like, you're sort of full steam ahead. So that's been, like, really awesome to watch.
00:33:58.444 - 00:34:27.044, Speaker B: And for the last question, this is the main one that I normally do, and everybody has different levels of experience that come on the show and different sort of opinions. But, like, what's your advice do you have for, like, newer and future developers on Solana to, like, to make sure that they're successful? Like, there could. There's a million different reasons for this. So, like, what? Like, what comes to mind for you for the newer and future developers to, like, be able to be successful here?
00:34:27.384 - 00:35:00.348, Speaker A: I mean, one, be passionate about the problem that you're solving, right. And whatever you're solving, do not look at it as a web two, web3 or web five or any Fibonacci number. Just look at it as you solving a problem that needs to be solved. And if it turns out that Solana or this particular blockchain is the one that enables you to solve it in the most efficient way possible, then you stick to it. Right.
00:35:00.476 - 00:35:26.276, Speaker B: I think. I think that's amazing advice. I think that, like, rings true through, like, not just like you sort of alluded to. It doesn't have to just be Solana. And I think that sound advice, it's like, build something for you or something for you that you're passionate about, hopefully that also solves a problem for other people. And then, like, you live in this world where you're building something that you love doing and it's also going to help people. And, like, that just sort of reaffirms the fact that, like, this is sort of where I want to be.
00:35:26.276 - 00:35:44.824, Speaker B: And, like, this is really awesome. And so, and Shaq, that's the end of the show. Thanks for joining us. It's been long overdue. We've been talking about this for a while. Really, really hyped to, like, have the first super team member on here as well. So thanks for joining and talk to you next time.
00:35:45.644 - 00:35:47.984, Speaker A: Awesome, man. Yeah. Love being on the show.
00:35:48.404 - 00:35:49.124, Speaker B: All right, cheers.
