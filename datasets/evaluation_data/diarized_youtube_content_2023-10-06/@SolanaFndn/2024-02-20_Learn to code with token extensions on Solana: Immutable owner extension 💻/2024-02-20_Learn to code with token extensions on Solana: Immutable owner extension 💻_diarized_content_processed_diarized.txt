00:00:00.200 - 00:00:38.674, Speaker A: The immutable ownership extension will make tokens a little bit safer, and it's because usually you can just take a token account and reassign its ownership to any other address. And this might be useful in many cases, but there's also a little bit of security risk here, because a DApp might derive your token account from the wallet and the mint, but the ownership might already be transferred somewhere else. So this is now solvable by adding the immutable owner flag, which, as the name already says, makes the ownership of the token account immutable. And the nice thing is that this will actually be by default enabled for all associated token accounts. So the CLI even tells you hey, you don't need to specify this flag anymore. So this is really nice and will make tokens a little bit safer.
