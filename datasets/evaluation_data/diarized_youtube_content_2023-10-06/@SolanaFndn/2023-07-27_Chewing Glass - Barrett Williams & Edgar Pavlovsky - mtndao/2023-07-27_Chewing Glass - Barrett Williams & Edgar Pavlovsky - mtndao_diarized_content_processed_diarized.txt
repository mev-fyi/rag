00:00:00.720 - 00:00:01.686, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other.
00:00:01.710 - 00:00:05.406, Speaker B: We'Re not gonna make it. Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off.
00:00:05.430 - 00:00:13.550, Speaker A: More than I can chew. Most of the time, I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life. A face full of glass hurts like hell when you're in it. That's weird.
00:00:13.582 - 00:00:17.318, Speaker B: That glass looks half full to me. Eating glass. Eating glass and staring at the abyss.
00:00:17.446 - 00:00:29.554, Speaker A: Glass. Who gives a shit about glass? Who the fuck is this? It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass. Better get some safety goggles next time.
00:00:37.494 - 00:00:58.514, Speaker C: Hey, everybody, and welcome to Chewing glass, the show where we talk to developers building the Solana ecosystem. Today we have a very special format where we have two guests coming from separate protocols. We have Barrett from Cypher and Edgar from Originfi. These guys have been crushing it recently. They've been around for quite a long time, and we're very excited to have them here. Hey, guys. How's everything going?
00:00:58.884 - 00:01:00.260, Speaker B: Hey, Chase. Stoked to be here.
00:01:00.372 - 00:01:02.732, Speaker A: Yeah, super excited to finally make it on the pod.
00:01:02.908 - 00:01:26.392, Speaker C: So I've known both of you guys for a while. I think I actually met Edgar at Solana sponsored Lollapalooza event two years ago before margin five was even a thought in his mind. So it's pretty cool to see how far we've come. I want to start off by asking you guys how you got your start. Like, are you traditionally trained engineers, or did you start in a different industry? So just help us understand how you got to where you are.
00:01:26.508 - 00:01:35.992, Speaker B: Yeah. Barrett and I have, like, I think a pretty cool story and a story that's, like, intertwined. Yeah, Barrett, I'll let you kick it off and tell them how we got started.
00:01:36.168 - 00:01:55.544, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, like, Edgar and I met each other in college, lived together in college. The story begins today, and effectively. Right. We were, like, best friends. Spent almost, like, every waking hour together. And it kind of, like, evolved us into becoming, like, best friends because at, you know, least that point, there was, like, nobody else awake. It was just Edgar and I.
00:01:55.544 - 00:02:30.452, Speaker A: And so we would, you know, figure it out. We were both in finance at the time, you know, being normal college kids, and then, you know, going to work after, like, partying and, you know, being at 03:00 a.m. And watching, like, Bloomberg Asia. We were, you know, messing around with, like, quantitative finance at the time, um, building, you know, trading module. Trading models. Uh, originally started in excel because neither of us knew programming, and then we both, like, picked up. Programming language is just on the side for fun.
00:02:30.452 - 00:03:17.288, Speaker A: Because we're interested in it and had some inkling of an idea of what quantitative finance was and what it was going to become. At the time, even though it was rather large, it was still a relatively new concept to us. And then I kind of fell in love with the math side of things, so added a math degree, and then Edgar and I really started to dive into math together. Um, even though Edgar wasn't part of the math department, he's obviously, you know, very quantitatively oriented. Anyway, um, and so that was, like, pretty cool. Uh, you know, ended up doing, like, research on sea ice movement in Antarctica and its effects on biomass production. Found out that the same model that I was using for that research priced financial derivatives, um, came back to Edgar, and I was like, dude, check this out, dude.
00:03:17.288 - 00:03:58.704, Speaker A: Um, and that's, I think when it, like, really clicked and, like, it became, like, a passion of ours, um, on, like, the, the kind of quantitative finance side of things. And, you know, our programming skills improved. Um, all self taught, really. Like, you know, my math. Like, I took, like, computational math, so didn't really learn, like, any true programming languages, like, took like a C class. Um, and, um, you know, a lot of it was Matlab, though, which isn't, I don't really consider a real programming language. Um, but I remember building my first, like, real trading algorithm in Matlab because that's where I was doing my research and figured out back testing.
00:03:58.704 - 00:04:42.330, Speaker A: And then at this point in time, Edgar, I think, was already out of college working at Goldman Sachs, and he was doing a number of different applications than I was. He was on the private equity side of things and building a lot of quantitative models for that. Interest rates, fixed durations. So that was pretty exciting to see. But then Edgar mentioned data science to me. I was still in college, so I still had time to be like, okay, what do I want to do? And I was like, oh, dude, this data science thing is cool. So Edgar and I were both preparing to become data scientists at the same time.
00:04:42.330 - 00:05:40.326, Speaker A: I remember doing leetcode together and a number of these case studies, which was really cool and was like, okay, I think data science is where I want to be. Quantitative finance was cool, but it was just a very narrow scope. And I still enjoyed what I did on the environmental research with sea ice movement, and it just seemed like you could tackle a lot more different industry spaces at the time with data science as opposed to just being a quantitative finance analyst. So that was really interesting to me. And then Edgar ended up getting a job at Uber, I believe was his first job as a data scientist doing a bunch of really cool stuff, and I'll let Edgar Opine and obviously give his side of the story. And then I ended up getting a job at a small tech startup in Utah. We both went to the University of Utah, by the way, big skiers.
00:05:40.326 - 00:05:44.478, Speaker A: So, you know, obviously made a lot of sense. I moved to Uber.
00:05:44.526 - 00:05:45.078, Speaker B: I moved to Uber.
00:05:45.126 - 00:05:45.310, Speaker A: We.
00:05:45.342 - 00:06:05.452, Speaker B: We part. We part cities. We moved. We were living in different cities for, like, a few years, and the. The whole, like, hanging out with each other in the middle of the night turned into, like, long calls. We just, like, get on the phone with each other for hours and just go down, like, Wikipedia rabbit holes and whatever, try to play the time zone game. It was.
00:06:05.452 - 00:06:28.968, Speaker B: It was amazing. When I was at Uber, I sat across a few teams that were really research and development for Uber. Uber had this model. They had core ride sharing businesses. So, like, rideshare eats food delivery. Those are businesses that were working for sure. And then they had experimental businesses outside of that.
00:06:28.968 - 00:07:17.066, Speaker B: And I sat on those experimental businesses, worked on a few rental products that Uber had spent some time in South America working on payments products, dealing with the cash heavy society down there, and then spent most of my time at Uber, actually on the bikes and scooters team. So if you remember those years when bikes and scooters, the shareable economy, exploded in cities, I was on the Uber team that was pushing that out. So saw a lot of really cool distributed system problems, saw a lot of organizational chaos. Was chatting with Barrett. Obviously, Uber was not a startup at the time. It was a much bigger company. Barrett was at a much smaller company.
00:07:17.066 - 00:08:04.646, Speaker B: So we had really cool opportunities to compare our experiences, like, hey, how's your job going? What are the messes in your organization? And I think both of us had infrastructure challenges from different sides. Me, from the massive scale that Uber was dealing with, from the bureaucracy bared, from the fact that he was this raw startup that was really trying to push boundaries with constrained resources. All of that, I think, would really funnel in to help us in the future as we started starting companies. So it was a critical moment for us. We were apart in different time zones. We were learning different things, bouncing a lot of ideas off of each other, and it would really compound in the future.
00:08:04.830 - 00:08:31.704, Speaker C: So, typically, after we sort of get your little introduction story, which is always amazing to hear for everybody on the show, what was your actual intro into crypto? What were you guys just degenerate traders? Did you just hear about it right in 2017 during the ICO boom? Did you start mining bitcoin in 2012. Like, how did you guys actually get your first start into crypto?
00:08:32.004 - 00:08:59.084, Speaker B: So 2012, 2013, we're in college. Barrett kind of discovers this bitcoin thing. He's playing poker. I'm not thinking about it really at all. Then 2017 kind of rolls around, and I'm in San Francisco. I hear about bitcoin again. One of my coworkers is like, hey, you should check it out.
00:08:59.084 - 00:09:35.454, Speaker B: I start reading about the technology, and I just get obsessed with blockchain technology, with the efficiency that is pitched by, at the time, chains that were pushing. I was always a high performance chain person. That was the Ethereum pitch is like, hey, on top of blockchain, unlike bitcoin, you can write programs. I remember I started writing solidity. I would go to this little meetup group that had 1215 people that would show up on a Saturday. They'd write solidity. But very quickly, you couldn't do anything with Ethereum.
00:09:35.454 - 00:10:11.830, Speaker B: I ran into that problem very, very fast because I said, hey, this is cool. I want to build stuff on blockchain. I have these product ideas. And then right away, it was, never mind, you can, because the infrastructure is just constrained. At the time, people were thinking, there was XRP conversation, there was AOS conversation, and this high level idea of high performance was pitched, but it was not tangible. There was just this very general idea of, hey, existing blockchains are slow. Maybe we can make them faster someday.
00:10:11.830 - 00:10:45.834, Speaker B: And that sounds like a good idea. And then we took another hiatus. Right. We decided not to go into the space full time. 2021 rolls around, and I was, I guess, even before that, 2020, 2021, I was running a different company. I had started a logistics software company, nothing to do with blockchain. Barrett had started a company at the same time, and he was looking at a move into web3.
00:10:45.834 - 00:11:06.078, Speaker B: And I'll kick it back to Barrett because he comes to me one day and he goes, hey, Edgar, there's this thing called Solana. We should really look at it. It's been making a lot of noise. It has the infrastructure arguments that we've been making. And so Barrett actually sells me on Solana. I didn't pay attention to it until he brought it up.
00:11:06.166 - 00:11:10.914, Speaker C: And so, Barrett, for you specifically, how did Solana get on your radar?
00:11:11.224 - 00:11:47.448, Speaker A: Yeah, so it all started during, like, COVID in quarantine. Edgar and I went to a hacker house for a month in Ojai, California. Loved the concept. It was just like a bunch of founders rented a house together, and we were building projects. Right? Edgar and I were both working on non crypto at the time, and I was starting to. This is, like, when it was seeded to move into web3, because, uh, the project that I had built was a recommendation engine for private capital markets. Um, recommending startups to investors, and investors to startups, right.
00:11:47.448 - 00:13:08.526, Speaker A: Um, and wanted to take that, like, a step further and democratizing access to private capital markets, um, talked to the OCC, or people at the OCC, interactive brokers, et cetera. Found out that if we wanted to build this derivatives exchange for, you know, pre ipo, uh, private capital markets, right, it was going to take years and years and years and hundreds of millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars to get it funded and actually make it there. And I was like, okay, where can we build this today? And that's, like, where the progression into web3 really began. And then Edgar and I hosted our own hacker house in Salt Lake City for two months, invited a bunch of founders together, and there, an individual who was pretty familiar with crypto, like, traded a lot. He introduced me to an ETH Maxi, and this ETH Maxi was like, hey, you should check out these other things as well. Introd me to Ben Spirango, actually. And this was January of 2021, and I had my first conversation with Ben about Solana, and I was like, oh, dude, this makes a lot of sense to build, like, a derivatives platform, right? They had serum at the time, which was an order book.
00:13:08.526 - 00:13:48.024, Speaker A: I'm a big order book guy. I think that that's the way exchanges on chain will be built and continue to be built. And Solana was the only place that you could build an order book, and one was already built at the time, and so you could compose on top of it and use its infrastructure to, you know, build your own project. Right. Um, and that was like an incredible, like, inflection point for making the jump into being full time in crypto and web3. And there was probably, like, 2025 of us at this house that we had, like, rented. I mean, people were sleeping on the floors, on couches.
00:13:48.024 - 00:13:49.568, Speaker A: It was like a six bedroom house.
00:13:49.656 - 00:14:12.900, Speaker B: This was, this was Mountain Dow v zero. So, like, before Mountain Dao became a thing, this, it was called mountain compound. And the hacker house idea, we just took it to the winter. We went down to Ojai. There were people going down to Mexico, Texas. Everyone's like, oh, we want to escape the winter for the warmth. And Barrett and I are like, wow, we're really excited to ski.
00:14:12.900 - 00:14:30.046, Speaker B: I don't want to escape the winter at all. And then we're sitting there one day, and we go, man, we're probably not the only ones who have that idea, right? But, yeah, at the time, and it was crazy. We bootstrapped it. People sleeping on the floor. I'll kick it back to you, Barrett. But it was an absolute mess. We did the Ikea thing.
00:14:30.046 - 00:14:30.950, Speaker B: It's crazy.
00:14:31.022 - 00:14:51.484, Speaker A: Yeah, dude. We'll probably talk about some of that later in the podcast. I bet. Found out about Solana, and then immediately became a shill. I thought it was the best thing that had ever happened to blockchain. I was like, okay, hey, I'm building here. And that's when I got into Solana.
00:14:51.484 - 00:15:27.304, Speaker A: And I was like, Edgar, I think that this is a place to build. That's where I'm going to build. Take a look at it. I know you're interested. And talk to a number of other people. Actually, another individual at that house, Nick, who founded clockwork, was at that hacker house, and that's his original introduction to Solana as well. And so I went down the path, started playing around, doing trading, participating in idos, and beginning to build, and ended up raising some money out of the hacker house, which was pretty cool.
00:15:27.304 - 00:15:36.504, Speaker A: And then that's where the journey poured gasoline on the fire, and we started building heavily in the Solana ecosystem.
00:15:36.964 - 00:16:07.156, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll just keep the timeline going, because the chronology is incredible. Bear it, finds out about Solana, raises some money, starts building on it. I am trying to exit the company that I'm working on. At the time. I remember I wanted to focus more on crypto, but I just really didn't have the time because I was doing something else. Baird, meanwhile, is pushing all of spring 2021. He's getting really deep, he's getting involved.
00:16:07.156 - 00:16:24.240, Speaker B: He's growing on Twitter. Right? Barrett gets me in to an invite only Solana breakfast down at bitcoin Miami in May of that year. Right? May or April of that year, whenever bitcoin Miami was.
00:16:24.392 - 00:16:28.960, Speaker C: So I think that's pretty much right shortly before you and I first met.
00:16:29.152 - 00:17:16.148, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a couple months before Chase and I would meet, right, at lollapalooza. And it was right around when the world was starting to open up. Right. So we had, like, gone through this pandemic thing, and, you know, the world was starting to open up. There were real life events. Baird gets me into this breakfast, and I just remember going there knowing, like, feeling like I knew nothing about Solana, completely undereducated relative to the people around me, and meeting Federa Sprengo, a bunch of other people there and just thinking. I had one thought coming out of that breakfast, and that thought was, these people are sharp, these people are smart.
00:17:16.148 - 00:17:36.684, Speaker B: They have interesting ideas. I want to be around these people. They're serious people. And from there, I was like, all right, now I'm paying attention. Now I'm really paying attention to this ecosystem. Like I mentioned, the world had opened up. There were Solana events popping up all over, all over the country, all over the world.
00:17:36.684 - 00:18:10.174, Speaker B: And Baird and I decided to do this crazy thing. We were like, look, we really want to get ingrained into the community. The best way to do that is through these real life events. So we are going to hit every single real life event that we can possibly get to, no matter where they are, no matter how close together they are. And we start getting on a plane, like, multiple times a week, showing up in different cities, like New York, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago. Doesn't matter. We're there.
00:18:10.174 - 00:18:56.180, Speaker B: And it was incredible. We were just getting added to all of these different group chats that were at first isolated to different cities, eventually formed a much bigger global community online, and really just meeting a lot of people with similar, like, fundamental ideals about how to build products. Right, folks that we're excited about performing infrastructure that were coming from distributed systems, backgrounds that thought about the world like we did. And, yeah, I mean, from there, like, you know, I think the community getting ingrained in the community was really kind of the important piece because that solidified that, like, we were going to be doing something there, I was going to be doing something there for me. Right. And then after that, the only question was like, what am I going to be doing?
00:18:56.372 - 00:19:13.892, Speaker C: So you're getting involved in the ecosystem. I assume this is the time when your project vision started to become more clear. It's just interesting that being best friends and your entire history, that you decided not to work together, you ended up doing your own things, which is super cool.
00:19:13.988 - 00:19:38.034, Speaker A: Yeah. So at the time, right. And I think one of the biggest reasons we never became, like, partners on a project on Solana, on the engineering side of things, is the timelines. Edgar was at a company exiting a company, and I was like, all right, well, I got some money, we're building. And so that timeline never really matched up, but that's why the hacker house.
00:19:38.074 - 00:19:39.934, Speaker C: Came about, and that's why we're partners there.
00:19:42.354 - 00:21:44.056, Speaker A: Cypher originally started as this protocol for enabling access to private capital markets through derivatives. We worked on the smart contracts and launching it for about eight months to a year, I think was that vision and the markets just weren't that liquid. It was hard to find market makers for pre IPO derivatives, considering that we were on an order book, um, and you needed, you know, trading partners there, um, and it's hard to price, right? And so the risk appetite for a market maker, um, not to mention they were also like pre IPO derivative assets, um, led to it being like challenging to get like liquidity. So cypher ended up, you know, moving into what it is today, which is this kind of all encompassing trading platform, you know, margin system for trading spot perps data futures options are coming, um, because we saw a liquidity fragmentation issue, uh, in defi and obviously, you know, in crypto then and still today, like most volume happens on centralized exchanges. Um, and I'm a big believer that, um, that's the case, one, because of like friction points, but two, because individuals and trading shops have access to all of the financial products that they would need in one location, right, you know, your spot perps futures options, et cetera, borrow lending, right? And so being a believer in decentralization and self custody, we're like, hey, this should be on chain, right? And so Cypher has pivoted and migrated into being this decentralized exchange that mimics a centralized exchange with its offerings. And the whole time Edgar and I would ideate on things as he was moving in. Um, we got an office together in the shop where, you know, Mountain Dow originally started.
00:21:44.056 - 00:22:09.124, Speaker A: Um, and, you know, every day, all day, all night, we're in there like, hey, what can we build? How do we make this better? Um, and I think that that's just like having somebody like that to continuously bounce ideas off was invaluable for the evolution and progress of, you know, Cypher, um, as well as his own startup. And I'll let him talk about what he ended up building.
00:22:09.664 - 00:23:03.496, Speaker B: The story of deciding whether we were going to work together and how I think is definitely really interesting. One of the things that we got to talking about when we were in that office was like, look, there are so many things that need being built here. What's the fastest way to cover ground? One of the reasons we decided not to work together was directly, was that if we weren't working together directly, we could build two teams at once. And we had that opportunity and that's become invaluable. We sit on separate projects, but it's a really tight ecosystem. The products are very closely intertwined. If you're following anything on social, at any point, you're hearing about Marginfi and cypher together with similar products.
00:23:03.496 - 00:24:05.144, Speaker B: Drift comes to mind. Jitto comes to mind. The composability narrative that was dominant for so long and I think continues to be important, has a lot of valuable backing to it. So we're thinking about how to cover ground, how to tackle these problems. We're in this office day and night. We decided to build two different teams out of it and then kept everybody close through this mountain Dao experience, which I think has been, on a personal level, amazing for me, because Barrett and I, we've been best friends for a really long time, and we've been trying to figure out this whole, like, okay, we're friends. Do we work together? How do we work together? How can we actually make that happen? There were times, I mean, long before we were funded founders, long before we had capital to deploy, like, sitting, you know, across some shabby table in some apartment that we had gotten together and, like, trying to figure out what the fuck to do.
00:24:05.144 - 00:24:44.870, Speaker B: So, um, you know, it's. It's cool to, it's cool to see. It's cool to see us come this far. I think, you know, what we think about now is really, like, our position in this ecosystem, how to continue being participants, how to do our part right. Uh, the bear market has brought new challenges compared to the bull market. We've had to evolve with the ecosystem, and I think the ecosystem has done quite a few backflips on its own. And so it's exciting to get to continue to be here, continue to drive the conversation and be a part of this as we look to get back on the upswing the next few years.
00:24:45.022 - 00:25:01.784, Speaker C: So we've been talking about a lot of great stuff, but I think at this point, let's talk about the origin story of Mountain Dow. What is it? How does it evolve and where is it going? You guys have been building some really great stuff coming out of this, so I think everybody is going to be excited to hear the story.
00:25:02.284 - 00:25:24.322, Speaker B: I'll let, I'll let you kick it off, Barrett. The one thing I want to say, chase, is we are definitely not producing those projects. It's the people that are coming that are producing them, and they're being produced way faster than Barrett and I could ever sit down and produce them. So, major shout out, first of all to the people that are coming and hustling at Mountain Dow. But, yeah, Barrett, I'll let you kick it off. Origin story, how we think about it, what's v four got?
00:25:24.498 - 00:26:16.326, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like the origin story, we alluded to a little bit earlier in the podcast, which was kind of this get a bunch of founders together and build, right? And it started when Edgar and I participated in our first, like, Hacker House founder House in Ojai in 2020. And then we're like, hey, we should host one in the winter. We're both big, you know, winter sports athletes, and everybody was trying to go somewhere warm, and we're like, we're trying to ski, you know? And so we hosted, like, a two month long one in Salt Lake City. We rented a house from the founder of Nitro Circus, which was, like, a big action sports show back in the day. So that was, like, super cool. And we went to Ikea, rented furniture. Cause we had to, like, retrofit this house effectively to be walking to, like, a regular Airbnb.
00:26:16.430 - 00:26:34.034, Speaker B: Like, this is not a co working space. This action sports legend, you know, for us, for me and Barrett, action sports athletes our whole lives. This guy's an absolute legend. He's talking to us about, like, where the toilet paper is, where the towels are, right? We walk in like, it's a house. Yeah, it's got no co working space. So we go to Ikea.
00:26:35.414 - 00:26:58.946, Speaker A: Yeah, so we go to Ikea and. And buy furniture, right? Cause we knew that they had 180 day return policy, no questions asked. So we're like, two months is less than 180 days. So we bought a bunch of furniture, retrofitted this house, had some funny things happen in the house. We'd flip power breakers, and we'd have to call Greg and be like, hey.
00:26:58.970 - 00:27:02.050, Speaker B: Greg, powerbreakers start dying every day.
00:27:02.202 - 00:27:02.730, Speaker A: Every day.
00:27:02.762 - 00:27:19.800, Speaker B: Greg's coming every day. He walks in the biggest table that you can get in Ikea for. Like, I remember it was like $600. Because keep in mind, we had no sponsorship money. Baird and I had no money. So we were like, we got to make sure we can return this table if we're going to put out $600 for two months. Like, I am sleeping on the couch.
00:27:19.800 - 00:27:30.352, Speaker B: I'm eating ramen. Like, we got to make this work. Greg starts coming in, he's like, what are you guys doing here? Because we didn't tell him, like, at all. There's monitor setup.
00:27:30.488 - 00:27:32.404, Speaker A: There's people.
00:27:33.024 - 00:27:39.124, Speaker B: At one point, he looked us seriously now, and he goes, is this a black ops site? Like, just. Just tell me. Like, I just need to know.
00:27:40.184 - 00:28:02.872, Speaker A: Yeah, dude. That was probably one of the most iconic conversations we had at that house, man. And then at that same house, right. Is when I discovered Solana and became, like, one of the biggest shows probably in the ecosystem. And it was all successful. Like, I ended up raising money. Some other startups ended up raising money out of the house.
00:28:02.872 - 00:28:43.918, Speaker A: Um, fast forward one year, or I guess, like ten months, right? It's December of 2021. Uh, and Edgar and I go, dude, we should run it back, right? And let's do something specific for Solana. Um, and so then we start to, like, brainstorm, and we're like, hey, how do we. How do we do it again? Like, we should probably not do it in the Airbnb. We want to make this big. And at the time, you know, Edgar and I had an office, um, in the co working space that I'm in currently, and talked to them were like, hey, how do you feel about if we rented a bunch of offices in an open area and brought a bunch of people together? And they're like, yeah, sounds great. Because Edgar and I were like, the first office on the fourth floor of the space.
00:28:43.918 - 00:29:39.206, Speaker A: It was like brand new, empty, credibly beautiful and modern. And we're like, okay, so we have a location now. What do we do? This is now way more expensive immediately than, like, the hacker house that we put on. And we were like, we want to make it free for people to come. And so, because I think a lot of it was that Edgar and I spent the time to go to a lot of these IRL in person events and travel and get to know people and become ingrained. We just started hitting up teams to see if they wanted to sponsor something like this, right? And ended up raising a good amount of money to put this event on. And this all came together in, like, probably like a month and a half, I think, on the v one of Mountain Dao, and just started pumping it on Twitter, and a bunch of people showed up.
00:29:39.206 - 00:30:21.014, Speaker A: It was good market conditions at the time. People were excited. People were coming into Solana and four weeks, I think it was also a very different format from hacker houses that were being hosted by Solana. We wanted to do, like, an extended version to really ensure good collaboration and team formation at the event and wanted to make sure it was incredibly beneficial for co working. So that's why we put it in a co working space, because if people are going to be here for a month, you can't party every day and also get work done. And so that's kind of like how it started. And it blew up, right? The first week was a little slow.
00:30:21.014 - 00:30:45.890, Speaker A: I think probably like 20 ish people were probably there on the first week of v one, and then people were like, oh, I'm going to come for like a couple of days. I'm going to come for a week, right? Some people were like, I'm going to be there for the whole month. This sounds awesome. And then it really caught fire in the end of the first week, going into the second week, and tons of people started showing up.
00:30:46.042 - 00:31:12.644, Speaker B: We were doing people who were like, oh, I'll be here for a couple days, end up staying three weeks. We're like running out of space, right? It was crazy. I mean, ecosystem teams from all over were coming in. And then I think what, you know, what was exciting for us is we started hearing this perspective that mountain Dao was different than what had existed before. I think that's what makes Mountain Dao special. It's what's kept it going. Right? Yeah.
00:31:12.644 - 00:31:17.460, Speaker B: I'll kick it back to Barry. I'm just excited interjecting, no, dude, take.
00:31:17.492 - 00:31:18.900, Speaker A: The rock and run, Edgar.
00:31:19.052 - 00:32:03.754, Speaker B: Mountain Dao thrived and I think will continue to thrive on this very basic concept of builder energy. Right? We wanted to be around cool people, building cool stuff that we were interested in, and we just took that idea and asked everybody else if they felt the same, and everyone else was like, yeah, that sounds sick. And then we said, okay, like, we'll just try to get everybody together. We'll just try to be the ones who handle the logistics. Right. But what makes Mountain Dow, like, special? Right. When people, when I talk to people and they, you know, they tell me about their experiences, you know, with Mountain Dow, and it really made it matter for them.
00:32:03.754 - 00:32:51.480, Speaker B: One of the things that is, like, most special to me is there's a lot of experiences that people have that they remember that me and Barrett were not a part of, right? It's not the events, it's not the talks. All that stuff is good, and it's helpful. It's a good foundation. But what's really incredible are those 04:00 a.m. Nights where you're caught up talking to someone who is your new co founder that you met ad mountain dow. You came in, you didn't know anybody, you were looking for somebody to work with, and you just spark magic with this person, right? And all of a sudden, you guys are hacking on something. 48, 72 hours later, you've got a product, right, which is insane.
00:32:51.480 - 00:33:26.908, Speaker B: Timelines. I mean, I remember I would wake up, walk through Mountain Dow with Barrett in the morning and talk to people who were like, hey, Edgar, I'm, like, almost done with that thing that you saw me working on yesterday, right? And I was just like, what is happening? That's how mountain Dow, uh, that's how mountain pay happened, right? Mountain pay got built in 48 hours. Right? And then I wake up, and TJ's viral on Twitter. Like, it was. It was absolutely unbelievable. Um, and so, you know, I think. I think what I think about when I think about how to, like, keep delivering that magical mountain Dow experience, um, you know, we want to.
00:33:26.908 - 00:33:53.256, Speaker B: We want to set up the foundation for people to come in and build relationships, but. But that experience, that's got to be very raw. It's got to be very native, right? Just like the fundamental energy to build. So, yeah, I mean, with v four, Barrett and I excited to do exactly the same thing. Right? We don't want to bloat it. We don't want to fill it with a ton of bullshit. We want to keep it raw.
00:33:53.256 - 00:33:59.608, Speaker B: We want to keep it focused on the fundamentals. We want it to be an incredible place to build, meet new people to build with you.
00:33:59.736 - 00:34:13.536, Speaker C: So we've reached the point in the show where we like to ask a few questions, and these questions are specifically about Solana. So here we go. What sucks for you guys about building on Solana?
00:34:13.680 - 00:35:04.983, Speaker A: Ooh, great question. I mean, I think that, like any new technology, there's always going to be problems, right? When we originally started, the problems are a lot different than today. When Cypher originally started, there wasn't even anchor. You were writing raw rust. I think Armani has done an incredible job, and now there's a ton of new frameworks that are out as well. I think on the developer tooling side, we're still farther behind other ecosystems in that front, but definitely see people out there building new frameworks, new ways to do testing, automated audits, et cetera. I think that these are some great tools that have been built.
00:35:04.983 - 00:36:04.328, Speaker A: I think that would definitely like to see some more frameworks, more languages, more clients. It's really awesome to see jump out here building fire dancer. I think client diversity is incredibly important for reliability. I think the number one issue, and I'm not ready to tell you that it's not an issue yet, is definitely that reliability standpoint, especially in DeFi. It seems to be fixed for the time being, which is awesome to see, but I think the reliability was definitely the number one concern and why DeFi took such a big hit over the last year and a half. I know that there are other factors that happened because of that, but that was definitely the leading cause, in my opinion, on a lot of that struggle that we had in Defi and Solana. Now I think a lot of it is still developer tooling.
00:36:04.328 - 00:36:42.622, Speaker A: I don't think we in the Solana ecosystem have something like foundry, the EVM ecosystem has and something like that I think is super important for people to have access to help just build smart contracts faster, help build safer contracts faster. I think that some of those developer tooling we lack currently, but definitely know teams that are working on a lot of really awesome frameworks and other applications and implementations to ease that, that pain point right now.
00:36:42.758 - 00:37:33.594, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a funny question because I've gotten so used to chewing glass right after years of being I think really an entrepreneur is what it comes down to as you go earlier stage in anything you do, the entire experience becomes a lot less structured, it becomes a lot more raw, and anything that you intend to do just has more unexpected obstacles. I think from an infrastructure perspective or from a developer experience perspective, I agree with everything Barrett said. The developer experience in Solana is a lot less raw than when we got started. I personally don't even feel like it's raw anymore. But in the context of developer experiences on the spectrum, it's still relatively early. I do think it's gotten a lot better. I think that's been incredibly important.
00:37:33.594 - 00:38:48.940, Speaker B: I actually think what, what I'm really interested to see evolve over the next year to two years is the non technical side of the builder ecosystem. I do think that obviously engineering is a core part to building out these ecosystems, building out these projects. But there's also been so much discussion on the engineering front that I think that wheel is moving now. There are still infrastructure issues. Stability and reliability have been on a much, much better trend the last six months or so, but long memories. We can assume there will be room to improve there, but the important part there is that the flywheel is moving now I think is a really fascinating time for marketing content types of people to really lean into the space and start sharing more of the foundation that I think has been progressed in relative quiet over the last six months. So I think when I think about what sucks, I just think I don't have enough hands.
00:38:48.972 - 00:38:50.004, Speaker C: That's what sucks.
00:38:50.164 - 00:39:28.884, Speaker B: I wish I needed less sleep. I wish I had more hands. I wish I could just clone people. But that makes me optimistic because especially with Mount Davi four kicking up, we're always meeting new people, they're always coming into the ecosystem. If you're somebody who's new and you want to put your hands to work, I think it's an absolutely incredible time to find something. It's not going to be handed to you on a platter. Like you mentioned, chase, no company in web3, let alone Solana, is the lofty, easy experience of working at a place like meta.
00:39:28.884 - 00:39:46.304, Speaker B: But you will not get to push yourself at a place like meta or Uber or Snapchat or any of the places that Barrett and I used to work like you could in this space. So I think for the right people, that's a really, really exciting trade off. I don't know, keeps me optimistic. It keeps me going.
00:39:46.464 - 00:40:01.364, Speaker C: All right, we started with what sucks first. Now let's get into a little bit of the more positive side. What is great about building oathalana and in the Solana ecosystem? We get a lot of different answers around this. So I'm really interested to hear your guys take.
00:40:02.064 - 00:40:59.644, Speaker A: I think a lot of people know about why we have built on Solana. It's fast, it's cheap, you can build things, applications that you can't build on other chains, at least on the l one, and even on l two s, in my opinion, it has the path to scalability. We're getting a new client. I think these are all great things. Um, right now, you know, it seems to be that, in my opinion at least, um, we're starting to gain, like, narrative momentum, right? Uh, and maybe that's just because of Solana CT and not like all of CT, but I think no pr is bad pr. Right. Um, and we have been seeing, um, you know, a lot Solana, like, come up on Twitter for good or for bad, way more in the last two months than we have in the last twelve months prior.
00:40:59.644 - 00:42:10.274, Speaker A: I think that that's something that's really exciting and really good for Solana, because people will then start to look into it more, start to look into the applications that are built on Solana more. We're watching a lot of the DeFi teams launch incentive programs, whether that's lips, points, airdrops, et cetera. And I think that this is another thing that is really awesome to be a part of in this ecosystem and watch this ecosystem fight through all of the adversity that has had over the last 15 months ish, maybe more. And I think that the determination and grit of the people that are building here, to continue to build here and believe in the ecosystem, is something that I find incredibly motivational and important and exciting. And a number of these new incentive programs that are coming out should be helpful in bringing more liquidity, more users, to the Solana ecosystem. And it can help a rising tide, like rising tides, lift all boats. There are a handful of teams doing these incentives now.
00:42:10.274 - 00:43:34.140, Speaker A: There will be two x in a month and two x of that in another two months. And I think that the wave is beginning to build for Solana and Solana Defi in particular, which I maybe have a biased opinion, but I think that any chain ecosystem to survive and thrive is built on a lot of Defi applications. I think that's one of the coolest things that's going on right now, is the narrative change and the general excitement about Solana, Solana applications and the underlying l. One value at this point, and I think that that is incredibly important. We've seen people like Ansem really pick up the microphone on Twitter and be broadcasting a lot about this. And other people on CT that have been incredibly negative have started to at least become more neutral, which I think is really big, is when those big players that have large audiences move from a negative to a neutral, that means the ecosystem is doing something right on the narrative and the community side of things that we may have lacked in the past. And I think that that is something that is really exciting, and I'm looking forward to watching that grow and continue to snowball here over the next months to a year.
00:43:34.212 - 00:44:33.380, Speaker B: Plus, I think this sounds so basic, but it really comes down to the community. The best thing about the Solana community is that great, bad, horrible, up, down. Like, people are here, people are hustling. There's energy. There's energy in the chat, right? And I think with really early industries that have a lot of unsolved problems, energy in the chat is the number one leading indicator of success, because you have no, like, you can't, you can't predict how hard the engineering problems are going to be. You have no idea what they even are on a three year timeline, not even a twelve month timeline. For being candid, the energy in the chat is really your indicator of, will there be people that continue to keep pushing through problems, whatever they are? The Solana community, I think, has proven, no matter what, they're interested in continuing to push.
00:44:33.380 - 00:45:09.200, Speaker B: I hope that if the time ever comes, we build the blockchain up from the ground up all over again, if we need to, in a large way. That's what's happening with fire dancer. That's what's happening with these new clients. People are saying, look, this piece of the core infrastructure needs a full rebuild, and that's cool because the technology is so new, right, that in order to evolve, you gotta keep pushing. And pushing could mean massive, massive revamps, right. Of certain pieces of the pie. Um, but, you know, people, people continue to be here, people continue to push.
00:45:09.200 - 00:45:20.256, Speaker B: Uh, I love that about this community. It's been, you know, working, working on margin and being in this, in this space has been the best job I've ever had, uh, I think strictly on, uh, you know, that, that community point alone.
00:45:20.400 - 00:45:36.312, Speaker C: So what advice would you give to young developers who are thinking about getting into the space but aren't really sure, they're not sure where to get started. They aren't sure if they're going to actually be able to be successful. Like what piece of advice or multiple pieces of advice would you give these people?
00:45:36.488 - 00:46:59.988, Speaker B: So I mentor younger startups from time to time, right? Founders of younger startups. I've been mentoring kids college age level for the last year or so in particular. And a lot of them are in a position that I think is very common for somebody who's interested in a space, considering to get more involved and in a position where, where they currently are is more traditional, right? Maybe you're in school, maybe you're in big tech, maybe you're in high finance, right? Maybe you're working for a big finance company or a big media company and you see web3. It seems exciting, but every time you look into it, the same structures aren't there. There's concerns. How real is this stuff? How risky is it to invest in? I tell people one thing, I go, the world is your oyster. It sounds lofty, but the reality is that each of us gets to wake up every day and fight to do whatever we want, right? And so many people with the globalization of the world, right, over the last few decades, are seeing unprecedented opportunity.
00:46:59.988 - 00:48:03.828, Speaker B: Like you can plug into the Internet, you can go to virtual parties, you can go to real parties, you could get into code bases, and you're there, you're part of it, right? The opportunity to get in the mix is so much better than it's ever been in all of humanity's existence, right? The most exciting thing I think you could do with your life is take it in your own hands and push it in whatever direction you want. And, you know, that fear, that risk that you're taking, like, that's just part of the adrenaline, right? That's what makes, that's what makes life worth living. So, you know, my high level, my lofty motivational goal, like, you know, commentary is the world is your oyster. Like, wake up, do whatever the fuck you want to do, and challenge yourself in the world to make that sustainable, right? Um, the people that I've seen that have, like, taken that on and really pushed, have reached absolutely incredible heights, uh, and have done things that, you know, uh, they've, they've, they've never imagined. I know Barrett and I just, with that methodology alone, have gotten way farther than we ever thought we would. So it's a, it's a good time.
00:48:03.996 - 00:48:22.554, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, you know, echo everything Edgar just said, um, and I think it, like, depends on your, you know, what you're coming in here to do. Right. If you're a developer, there's never been, like, a better industry to, like, show off your dev skills. Right. Like, open a pr to a protocols, open source repo. Right.
00:48:22.554 - 00:49:14.670, Speaker A: Easiest way to start building. Those teams out there are, you know, incredibly insightful and are excited for you to even, like, be looking at their code base and helping out in any sort of way, and they're happy to offer, like, resources, insight, et cetera. Right. I think that that's something that is very unique to this space and industry that you don't really see in kind of the other traditional industries to get a part of. On the engineering side, on the marketing side of things, people are writing threads, people are putting out content on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, et cetera. And that's a great way to get noticed. And I think the way to get noticed and kind of get into this space is you got to dip your toes in at some point, and so you can start, like, building, if you want to be a researcher, build a research Persona on Twitter.
00:49:14.670 - 00:49:53.668, Speaker A: I think it's easier than people think to become a part of the ecosystem, become a part of the space, become a part of the community, where if you look outside and you're like, oh, this is some niche group, or these people are all way ahead of me, so why should. What am I going to be able to contribute to value? And you will always be able to contribute value, um, if you want to. Right. Uh, and I think that those. That comes in a lot of different ways from, like Edgar said, the media side, the engineering side, uh, marketing community, et cetera. Um, there's just, like, a ton of different ways to get in here. Uh, and, you know, maybe you don't know what you want to do, but you want to meet some people, go, come to moundao.
00:49:53.668 - 00:50:10.084, Speaker A: Right. You know, we're a big proponent of. Of, no matter your background, no matter your skill set, how long have you been in crypto? You've been in crypto, zero days. You've been in crypto, you know, ten years, it doesn't matter. To us, like, come and experience that. Go to a Solana hacker house. Right? Go to an ethereum hacker house, whatever.
00:50:10.084 - 00:50:44.140, Speaker A: Come to a Solana hacker house. Come to mountain Dow really is where you want to go. And so I think that's, like, the best way to get in. You're going to meet people. You're going to meet people that are going to help you push to get exposure on Twitter, to get more ingrained in the ecosystem. Right? You gotta take the first step, right? And there's, like, a number of ways to do that. And whatever your skillset is, um, you know, just take that first step, and I can guarantee it that, like, people will be there to help you forward whatever you want to do in this space, especially in the Solana ecosystem.
00:50:44.140 - 00:51:15.128, Speaker A: Right? Like, you know, I started with very little knowledge of Solana. Um, and so did Edgar. And we, you know, worked hard and met people and got a lot of help along the way. Right. Because we put that first. We made the effort to get into the space. And I think that once you make that little bit of effort, it just snowballs, and you'll start to see more of the community, more of the ecosystem and industry that is misrepresented in media and on Twitter.
00:51:15.128 - 00:51:38.444, Speaker A: And I think that that's something that you should see for yourself when you're on the ground floor. It's very different than just, like, looking from the outside to end. There's a ton of people out here that are building, you know, revolutionary products and pushing the boundaries and pushing forward with what we can build in this space and on Solana. And I think that, you know, just take the leap right at the end of the day.
