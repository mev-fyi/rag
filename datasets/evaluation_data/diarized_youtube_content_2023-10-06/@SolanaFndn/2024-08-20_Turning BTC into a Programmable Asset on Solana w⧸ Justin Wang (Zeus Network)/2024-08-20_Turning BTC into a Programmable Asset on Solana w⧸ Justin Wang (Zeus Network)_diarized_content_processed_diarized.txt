00:00:05.000 - 00:00:06.632, Speaker A: Justin, welcome to Validated.
00:00:06.785 - 00:00:08.045, Speaker B: Pleasure to be here.
00:00:08.905 - 00:00:39.137, Speaker A: So this is our second episode talking about the intersection of Bitcoin and the Solana universe. So last time on the show we talked to Threshold and Thesis about tbtc, which is sort of a bridge liquidity layer that brings wrapped Bitcoin to Ethereum and then brings that asset to Solana. But what you guys are doing at Zeus is a little bit different. You guys talk about this as the first communication layer between Bitcoin and Solana. What does that actually mean?
00:00:39.281 - 00:01:26.703, Speaker B: This is the type of question that I often get asked from people in a conference, like what is Zeus like? Is Zeus layer 2 or is Zeus layer 2 for SVNs? You know, answer is no entirely. You know me as a founder, I strongly disagree with fragmentation on the layer 1 perspective. First, in terms of usability for the user size, why would you want to change RPC to another new layer? But if a layer 1 Solana is far more usable than most of the layers already. And second, but the most importantly is liquidity fragmentations. We have experienced that for the last two years from Ethereum perspective, from EVNs there too. It's not the solutions. There could be a temporary solution, but for the long term, sustainable solution wise.
00:01:26.703 - 00:02:00.045, Speaker B: I don't think users really appreciate that. We start seeing the reason why Anatolia Raj from two years ago saying that one layer should transact everything instead of multiple layers on top of it. So what Zeus does, we portray ourselves as a layer 1.5, so long as a layer 1 + 0.5 Zeus, which would enable external assets like Litecoin, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, any UTXO chains that are not programmable, we make it programmable on Solana using SPN on the layer web perspective.
00:02:00.205 - 00:02:45.325, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's get into a little bit of how that actually works. I think famously Bitcoin and these other types of assets you mentioned, they don't really have a smart contract system. There's some taproot magic and there's maybe some bitvm sometime in the future. But if you look at all of the existing L2s today, like the Bitcoin L2s today, they're really side chains with some sort of trust minimized bridging. Very similar to how Polygon proof of stake has no direct security relationship to Ethereum. It is a side chain at that point versus something like an optimism which is actually built properly on top of the Ethereum stack. So walk me through a little bit how like you call this a layer 1.5.
00:02:45.325 - 00:02:50.943, Speaker A: How does it differ From a classic like sidechain implementation.
00:02:51.119 - 00:03:45.941, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. First of all, I just want to emphasize on the Bitcoin layer 2 aspect, right now we probably see more than 30, 50 plus Bitcoin layer 2 so called coming out this year or around end of last year that time. And a lot of like Austin said, obviously a lot of these layers are not correlated with bitcoin on the layer one consensus more so they're more like a sidechain perspective with their own POS mechanisms enabling their own security rather than working interchangeably with a bitcoin pow consensus. So that to me they are just creating a layer and then which something called bvn. You are pretty much taking EVN perspective into their own layer. Changing gas from Ethereum to Bitcoins. Is that helpful? I'm not sure because every cycle users, investors, obviously retailers are changing their appetite and they know what is good, what is good for the future of web3s.
00:03:45.941 - 00:04:35.051, Speaker B: So and then that's why here's the reason why I started Zeus almost 14 months ago. All right? I went, I was in Europe, I went to a couple of bitcoin conferences and I was just like diving into all these technical paper on a bitcoin layer to I realized that hey, they're just creating their own layers and why don't we just mix a lot of the L2 for these pow consensus ETXO chains out there. And we have to know that, right? A lot of these miners, they're looking for sustainable yields. They're not looking for crazy incentives like 10, 20% yield. Yeah, sure, he could be appealing for the first few days, but where does the yield come from? Right? We have to know yield comes from users. If a protocol and EcoSystem has no Dapps and users, the yields are inflationary. Most of the aspects are coming from their own native tokens.
00:04:35.051 - 00:05:31.035, Speaker B: So I still think that's law is providing the most sustainable yield right now. If you look at in terms of on chain activities and on chain growth rates. And here's the reason why. You know, a lot of people ask me if ZEUS is not L2 because layer one point for how does that work? Which means Zeus, all these assets are communicated over to Solana by Zeus are safely guarded by ZEUS nodes. And ZEUS node is a consensus. It's a consist of NPC models running on top of Salana validators, which means we don't run our own validator, we have our own nodes and nodes nodes empower on consensus, which is NPC models every asset that are deposited into the external blockchain Address are safely guarded by the node itself. Which means even Zeus foundation ourselves have no right to really take the assets, whatever you deposit and minx on a salon side of it.
00:05:31.035 - 00:06:37.129, Speaker B: So I think it's refreshing in many aspects that Zeus also get asked a lot, are you guys bridge? You know, first of first of all, like, you know, without bridge, you know, we are far more interoperable, composable in a way that people can build on top of ZPL and then creating ZPL assets and then ZPO assets actually derived by token extensions. So we're extremely confident that with ZPO assets, especially like external assets like Bitcoin litecoin room order nodes, it's really going to do the strong showcases of what token extension can do for the Solar Sol ecosystem. And then obviously with the revenue models of Zeus ZPO assets, which is token extension models, the more transaction that is being on chain, the more revenue we earn in cell and the more we kick back to Zeus node itself too. So right now there are already six things that want to build on top of zpl. They want to build like a multi chain launchpad. You know, I'm not sure a lot of you guys have experience using ordinal unisets wallet to purchase order known stats. It takes about 30, 40 minutes.
00:06:37.129 - 00:06:54.445, Speaker B: And not just that, right. You're pretty pretty much paying inscriptions, tokens. On a bitcoin block that has no utilities, that has no programmable actions, you can do governance on top of it. But why can't we migrate these to Solana? I think that could be interesting moving forward.
00:06:54.865 - 00:07:21.207, Speaker A: Yeah, so I want to kind of go back to like that technical layer of how Zeus actually operates. So you mentioned there's kind of this node coordination network that's running on top of Solana. But if I'm taking something like Bitcoin, right. Walk me through what is the journey of me taking from a technical perspective, me taking a bitcoin that's on the bitcoin network and generating something I can use in Solana defi via Zeus.
00:07:21.391 - 00:08:10.063, Speaker B: So Apollo is a first step building on top of zpl. So pretty much Apollo and the mission is Apollo is onboarding millions of bitcoins through Solana. And what it does Apollo leverage the communication portal between Bitcoin and Solana using Solana to validate whatever happens on the bitcoin ends. So which means to walk through, you simply deposit your bitcoins into the address that's being provided by Apollo's and it will provide you another version of a ZPU asset which is called ZBDC on Solana end and your BTC is simply guarded by Zoom souls. No one has the right to take whatever the BDC does depositing in the address. And then you can use ZBDC deposit into this for example, like Caminos or any structure products or bar lendings. I think these are the type of defi action that bitcoin institutions are looking for.
00:08:10.063 - 00:08:15.071, Speaker B: You know, even just 1% of yield sustainably, it's huge for miners.
00:08:15.183 - 00:08:55.755, Speaker A: So where, you know the classic problem with every time you're trying to move a bitcoin off of the bitcoin network is someone or something has to custody it. And because there's no smart contract programming language on bitcoin, you can't do what you typically do on a network like Solana or Ethereum where you wrap it in a smart contract program that is open source and audited and battle tested from that perspective. So what does the actual custody look like on this case? Are you basically taking that bitcoin seed phrase for that address and breaking it up and npcing it throughout the nodes or how is the actual bitcoin secure? Carrot?
00:08:55.915 - 00:09:38.941, Speaker B: So basically we use tab roots. So you deposit into a tab address for your bitcoins and it sends signals to our Zeus nodes and then each of the Zeus nodes is six Zeus nodes will divide their private keys and then use NPC to mix up the private key. So no one knows on chains which nodes are actually holding the key to transact. And then pretty much all of these six nodes have to be operated at the same time to really ensure the transaction from the table address are being validated on SVN levels. So in the short term for non technical people, we're using Salon to validate whatever happens on the bitcoin side. And once Solana validated on our end by Zeus notes and then we release the token which is called zbdc on the Solana ends and you have that ZPO asset on your wallet.
00:09:39.053 - 00:09:50.055, Speaker A: Nice. And so if I want to go the other way, if I've bought ZBTC on Solana and I say I want to deposit it into my bitcoin address, how does that like redemption flow work?
00:09:50.215 - 00:10:32.685, Speaker B: So once you get zbdc, you can also withdraw from Apollos. So pretty much the amount of ZBDC will not inflate unless there are more BTC deposit into totally. And if there is strong demand of zbdc, there's going to be king cheap premiums in some perspective. If the Solana CBDC on Solana side is higher priced than Azure btc, there's going to be average charge opportunities and I believe that more people will actually want to deposit BDC into CBDC and sell on Solana. And once you hit that equilibrium levels, the price will adjust it to a market level as well. And obviously there's no work on bitcoins and I think with this way more demands will cause more supply and eventually if you meet the equilibrium levels for the price itself.
00:10:33.185 - 00:10:56.777, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. But if I want to unwrap, for lack of a better term and get. So for example, with Thesis or Threshold, the Redemption ark is on Solana, you have to bridge it to Ethereum and then you can talk to the Thesis network and you can get BTC back on the other end. How does that work with Zeus? Or you know, maybe completely different.
00:10:56.881 - 00:11:08.257, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like honestly, just withdraw your CBDC to BTC address. Yeah, we're going to ask you to provide your BDC address and within 12 hours you're going to get your BDCs on theirs.
00:11:08.401 - 00:11:13.335, Speaker A: So is that like we still have the loop or how is that kind of managed for that redemption?
00:11:13.635 - 00:11:34.339, Speaker B: It's not a program levels because we have like CO reserve, high reserve on the balance sheets. So we want to ensure that nobody, not everyone's going to reserve and then does malicious attack at one time. So there's going to be co reserves. For example, 60% of BDCs is going to be hot wallets, 40% is going to be cold wallets as well. And everything is done by on the per side as well.
00:11:34.467 - 00:12:00.715, Speaker A: Yeah. So walk me through kind of how that coordination works. So you mentioned that you guys are using taproot addresses and so the Zeus nodes are controlling the npc. How do they reassemble the key to then withdraw bitcoin from that taproot address? Like when someone requests, let's say there's a thousand bitcoin in this particular address and I want to get one out or something like that.
00:12:01.015 - 00:12:39.565, Speaker B: So when you give extra bitcoins ZBTC on a Solana site, somebody's losing it. Yeah, that's how it works. And when you want to withdraw through Apollos, which is the first adaptability on top of zpl, you're going to have to provide your bitcoin address. And then once law is pretty much like a lock and main mechanism, so you release your ZBDC and then one of the address for the CO reserves is going to release to a hotwire address and then you're going to get your bitcoins on the provided address and this way has no censorships. There is no third party. Everything's done by procedures and the programmable weights proceed.
00:12:39.725 - 00:13:01.285, Speaker A: Nice. And so how do you kind of view the future of kind of a Bitcoin Solana communication layer? Like the first use here is sort of not exactly bridging, but something similar to bridging or synthetic asset creation with a one to one backed asset. What are the other applications you see for communications layers between Solana and networks like Bitcoin?
00:13:01.445 - 00:13:26.475, Speaker B: I think Apollo is going to demonstrate the potential of having layer 1.5 between Bitcoin and Solana. You know, I mean Salah can make Bitcoin programable with sv. The potential of Svens and obviously Apollo is the first restaking of a big BDC question. Restaking BTCs from BDC to Salah. And I think the more use cases that we think that people want to collateral their bitcoin issue stable coins on Salah as well. That could be game change as well.
00:13:26.475 - 00:14:28.327, Speaker B: If Dai could work out Evans, why can we do stable decentralized algorithmic stable coins on Salon collect as being collateral by bitcoins could also work very well as well. And more perspective is that there are more than 50 plus thousand of collection order nodes. There are lack of utilities, no governance, no way to really propel the community more even for us with a lot of consensus and decisions. But with Zeus you can really build synthetic Dell tokens from Word Node to SPL, ZPL standards. And then people can really use reliance on Solana votings a lot of things cool thing you can do with that. And then also by the way Launchpad as well, right? I think as a matter of fact that like if you want to use unisex a lot of bitcoin wallets to purchase sats or rooms, a lot of all these like encrypted letters, it takes forever and the user experience are pretty terrible actually. So if we can use Solana deposit your deposit your sold to buy whatever on a bitcoin ends that could be interesting models as well.
00:14:28.511 - 00:14:42.835, Speaker A: Yeah, so I want to kind of go back to one piece which is you mentioned this is all built using Salon as a coordination layer. Why did you guys decide to make that decision and sort of what was that process like what else did you evaluate for architecture decisions?
00:14:43.135 - 00:15:34.447, Speaker B: Yeah, I think frankly speaking, we've been building Aslan since late 2019, early 2020. We were probably one of the earliest Asian developers in Asia that are been advocating Solana since day one. You know, you can't always pick a better chance. Obviously there's a reason why we stay in Solana for the last four, almost five years already is that every year there's always better chain with faster tps. But the chain that has been constantly going through stress tests, constantly going through battles and it has the best social economics, social communities, I think that those are the chains that you want to bid on. And then we have proven that our thesis were right from already this year down. Chain usage for Solana and then daily activity, wallet address has been phenomenal in one aspect.
00:15:34.447 - 00:16:16.809, Speaker B: And why make Solana and Bitcoin together? I think that's very interesting models. A lot of people ask me Justin, what do you think of this first place? I think if there has to be one layer that has to be interacted with Solana, it has to be Solana. I'm sorry, with Bitcoin has to be Solana. You know Ethereum had, they had their own chance last cycles, WBDCs, rain, BDC, all these like so called like communication there they were trying to do a similar what salon does. They couldn't pull it off because layer 2, it wasn't because of the design of layer 1 there, it was because of competition of layer 2 due to high cost, low speeds. And if you have, you have two chains that are low speed trying to work with each other, it doesn't make sense in many aspects. Right.
00:16:16.809 - 00:16:36.769, Speaker B: So I think Solana has proven low cost, high speeds. It's actually buildable and much easier to build compared to before and not to mention user acquisitions. I think a lot of people think that I can be the first product in this chains and I have the market shares but it doesn't work that way.
00:16:36.897 - 00:16:40.697, Speaker A: Everyone tries to run the Lido playbook. Yeah, exactly.
00:16:40.841 - 00:17:16.145, Speaker B: Why would you want to build on anything on top of besides iOS and androids right now it doesn't make sense to me at all. So for Me Androids, Ethereum, iOS is Solana. If we can make iOS work with bitcoins which is on tab liquidities, we have a strong edge over here. And it's not just that, right? Like I mentioned there are six projects want to build on top of zpl. These projects are coming from bitcoin communities, it's not coming from Solana. They have enough frustrations from so called Bitcoin layer 2 too much promising. And then people don't realize that it's actually not that easy to build a layer.
00:17:17.285 - 00:17:50.277, Speaker A: Yeah, this is one of the things people always underestimate. They think oh we'll just build a management layer on top of this thing. And other than base, very few have actually managed to build a strong compelling one. Which I think is very, very interesting. The problems of building a system that's dependent on another system are pretty massive. Not to say it can't be done, but it's just, it's a hard process to get right.
00:17:50.461 - 00:18:03.345, Speaker B: I agree. I mean like there's always better chains out there every year obviously it's going to come out like faster tps, faster this, secure that. But who's actually using it? People actually use it.
00:18:03.725 - 00:18:23.613, Speaker A: So I want to take a little bit of a turn here. You guys have an kind of interesting model and correct me if I'm understanding this right or wrong, but of like a verifiable program library on Zeus. How does that work and what's the reason for needing like a program registry there?
00:18:23.789 - 00:19:23.395, Speaker B: Basically how we differentiate us with a lot of so called questions layers out there is that first of all we are not layers, we're layer 1.5. So we pretty much opens another doors for SLAW to really interact with external blockchains interchangeably and permissionless ways to do that. Second, but most importantly we want to advocate future developers and founders to build the next generation of cross chain products. And I'm still a believer the future should be monolithic in a way. That future should be multichain cross chains in many aspects. If SVN is really propelling the cycles and really helping a lot of users and founders to build next generation web3 apps, why can we enable this to external blockchains? A lot of these UTXO chains out there, they're untapped liquidity. In my opinion they're sitting at around 10 billion to 50 billion, 100 billion like Solon Bitcoin liquidity out there, they're waiting for us to really develop the next generation of devs to really propel moving forward.
00:19:23.395 - 00:19:39.991, Speaker B: So um, I just spoke to litecoin miners three days ago actually. They're very excited. They're very excited. First of all they can be programmable at first ever. I mean there were chains out there that wanted to try it. I also spoke to Miner, one of the big biggest miners for Dogecoin as well. They want to make that happen as well.
00:19:39.991 - 00:19:44.799, Speaker B: Why can Dogecoin work with Solana? It could be a lot of interesting model moving forward as well. Right.
00:19:44.847 - 00:20:15.425, Speaker A: So yeah. So do you sort of see a lot of these networks then as. Because Doge there have been proposals floating around for Doge to migrate to proof of stake for a long time and in that migration there's Always kind of been an assumed, oh well, we could easily add some form of light compute layer on top of that as well. Do you sort of see that as like maybe not gaining as much traction and instead they're looking at oh, what if we could just bring the Doge asset class to other networks?
00:20:15.585 - 00:20:57.613, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. First of all, I'm pretty sure Ethereum foundation spent probably half billion dollars from migrating POW w POS at least for these last four years. And in terms of Doge, if you go to the GitHub on the Cedar commitments, it's not even close to theories, obviously. And if that doesn't work, why can't we so long help? And then frankly, I spoke to two dogecoin miners. They're very optimistic about these kind of collaborations. Right. They have so much Doge sitting there, mostly into institutions, wallets, collateral, getting more stable coins, or just sitting in F2 pools lending their Doge for whatever people want to borrow against you.
00:20:57.613 - 00:21:14.899, Speaker B: So if there are innovations between Doge and the actual dogecoin that could be potentially earning yon Salana or multiple crushing dapps or even Caminos, even earning yields from drips traded dogecoins, native Dogecoin on Solana, that could be interesting as well.
00:21:15.027 - 00:22:01.961, Speaker A: Yeah. So what do you kind of see as like the relevancy for these proof of work assets over the long term? Like I think the bitcoin pitch is fairly well established at this point, you know, oh, like the most secure form of digital asset you can get is bitcoin. Right. There's a whole narrative around that structure. But I think if you start looking at the other proof of work assets, that thesis gets a little bit shakier because there's only one gold, right. And maybe there's two golds now there's bitcoin as well, but people don't have that same sort of fervor for silver or platinum or any of the other rare metals. There's something that's really captured people's minds about gold.
00:22:01.961 - 00:22:27.037, Speaker A: So Doge obviously has this very big meme coin status, but Litecoin as well. Where do you see demand for these assets being programmable? Come in? What is the sort of. I'm not really asking you to justify their existence, but why are these asset classes still desirable in a proof of stake world?
00:22:27.181 - 00:22:48.365, Speaker B: Yeah, obviously PoW came first, then Po PoS and then migration of PoS from PoS for Ethereum, obviously due to scalability and the speed of chain itself. Does Miner really want that happens? I spoke a lot of OG miners For Ethereum a lot of them have moved to AGI marketplace which is AI computing powers.
00:22:48.485 - 00:22:49.265, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:22:49.805 - 00:23:30.799, Speaker B: I think a lot of it are due to speed of a chain sale and then the need to change overalls and then Am I the fan of pow? I'm actually a fan of pow. I think it's probably the most decentralized consensus out there that could be fairly distributed. Two people could really mine the coins with their own lovetime creators from the early days. And then if you have to purchase mining machines right now, it's probably could cost you like a fortune right now for a lot of retailers. But back in the days it was fairly distributed. So do I think POW is going to dry down or go faded? I don't think so. I actually seen a couple of POW chains out there are emerging right now with a lot of speeds, improvements or programmable actions.
00:23:30.799 - 00:24:08.285, Speaker B: Casper so called a lot of POW chains, even file coins are from the early days as well. So yeah, it's probably one of the best way to fairly distribute it not just from a coin perspective perspective but also from a network perspective as well. And yeah, there's always going to be battle between POW pos without questions in my takes and then obviously it's probably coming from the people that with their own intentions and benefits. But it's good for industry, right? There's always debates, there's always discussions.
00:24:08.665 - 00:24:28.015, Speaker A: Definitely. So you mentioned Apollo is the first application that's been built on top of Zeus. Is there anything else you can tell us about what's getting built now? And also for developers who are maybe interested in learning more and digging into the code and figuring out what they could build on the network, where can they go to get started?
00:24:28.315 - 00:25:21.275, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So we are going through Muses testnet right now. It's the last test step before we actually enable Zoo Snow opening on the mainnet betas. We are targeting mainnet betas hopefully around breakpoint time so we can release around Breakpoint for minute betas and then people can really leverage I stake their tokens and delegate into the nodes and together protect the zoos network together. And when that happens the bitcoin could really come into slob in the provision matter through Apollos and Apollo is the first steps and we also want to do Apollo token with points it could be no VC back and actually the token that has dozens of bitcoins behind the debt itself. So lot of way we can do it. And yeah, and then we also want to host the first ever Zeus hackathon.
00:25:21.275 - 00:25:54.189, Speaker B: I want a quarter of this series late this year's with Taipei Hacker House, which is around December. I think Salon is also the biggest sponsor at that time as well. And yeah, and then our goal is to be one of the tracks for next year for Salon hackathons. I still think that Salon there YSVN could probably be the only solution enabling Bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, any ot Excel chains out there coming to Solana. And when that happens, we have a strong edge to compete with Ethereum TVL in my perspective.
00:25:54.317 - 00:25:58.901, Speaker A: Very cool. Well, Justin, thank you for joining us today on Validated.
00:25:59.013 - 00:26:00.645, Speaker B: Thank you guys. It's been my pleasure.
