00:00:00.400 - 00:00:07.838, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we're live here with Norbert, the founder of Synthetify, the future of synthetic assets on Solana. Welcome, Norbert.
00:00:08.006 - 00:00:10.474, Speaker B: Yeah, nice to be here.
00:00:10.854 - 00:00:13.510, Speaker A: All right, take it away, man. Yeah.
00:00:13.582 - 00:00:57.664, Speaker B: So let's start with the synthetic. So maybe, first of all, I give some background about me. Who am I and what I'm doing. I am founder, main developer and product, probably a CEO on synthetic. This project started basically as probably hackathon, but over time it evolved both in the synthetic itself and the underlying framework, which is anchor into something bigger. And this is turning out to be really cool project. And basically I launched a company that will be pushing the limits of the Solana and building a synthetic asset on top of it.
00:00:57.664 - 00:02:15.412, Speaker B: Okay, so let's start. As you guys probably know, the synthetify got a second place on a hackathon, and we are really leveraging the limits of the Solana by giving ability users to create synthetic assets basically out of thin air based on their collateral. And it's a really good experience if we compare it to like, Ethereum based exchanges or NBM blockchain. Solana is so cheap and so fast and that we are able to enable, you know, much more pleasant experience for users. Of course, synthetic file will be, let's say, part of the Defi. And Defi is, you know, super growing ecosystem, both in terms of like decentralized exchanges will currently, if they are built on top of Solana, will be able to compete with, you know, FTX guys or even more. But also there is much more place to, you know, expand, for example, you know, synthetic will be kind of directly, you know, I don't see a competition like, you know, let's say Ethereum.
00:02:15.412 - 00:03:16.480, Speaker B: I'm more thinking about the competition for, let's say, OTC FTX since, you know, I will be probably able to provide, you know, maybe even better prices, but fully unchained. So that's definitely something that I am hoping complete. Most of the problems are coming currently with the Oracles, and all kinds of stuff that is happening mostly on Ethereum chain is caused by just inefficient network and huge risk. Of course, you know, that we are basically kind of competing with platforms like synthetix, and they were suffering hugely from oracles and fronde issues. And this is kind of patched. But right now they are suffering from the huge or enormous transaction fees that on Solana are basically close to zero. And also the confirmation time, I think, is especially important for trades.
00:03:16.480 - 00:04:11.332, Speaker B: You want your trade to be confirmed immediately, not wait ten blocks or 15 minutes for your transaction to be mined. So that's definitely important. And also the liquidation in terms of know when there is black swan event or something like that. Like during the March crash, most liquidation system were backlogged just because people were not able to liquidate somebody because the transaction fee was such insane, so you could liquidate somebody for one k. But the transaction fee was okay, so it was just not efficient enough. So here's our solution. We are building completely on top of Solana and everything will be on chain, so we'll be keeping a lot of compatibility, we'll be able to interact and integrate with other protocols.
00:04:11.332 - 00:05:12.804, Speaker B: Transaction will be close to instant, will be free, and our oracles will be updating probably every single block. This is still under testing, but from current experience it seems like oracles will be super good. We'll be also adding some additional features like for example dev pool control that will enable us to give much more efficient capital allocation so you will not have to keep huge collateral ratio. For example, right now I think on Ethereum average crater is like 500 400. So I think it's still too big. And this still will be dependent on underlying liquidity of synthetic token and other stuff. But definitely we'll be aiming towards low 200.
00:05:12.804 - 00:06:06.214, Speaker B: There's much more stuff. The safety, just the bandwidth of the network will be much more effective in terms of like, you know, the liquidation events. I think the cross pairs are, you know, not expressed enough. People that want to directly exchange, for example FTT to NBB and you know, in other side around, they will be able to do it on synthetic in one trade without going to the USD or any other assets. And you know, the fee will be the same and the price, of course there will be no slip, so price will be the same. There's also whole range of possibilities that we can expand. For example the synthetic futures prediction market, leverage trading multiple collaterals and there's much more, but we'll see how it will evolve.
00:06:06.214 - 00:07:09.714, Speaker B: Right now our current direction is just bringing the synthetic assets to the market. Of course our is important to, you know, to get some info about token, how our token will be used. So my purpose will be a collateral for all the synthetic assets, but we'll be also adding some more features like discounts for performing swaps or exchanges on synthetify. There will be also a governance built on top of this token that will be not only governing like the synthetic platform, but also all the features that we are planning that going to be built on top of syntax and I'm personal that is super focused on the product, not the promises. I think I'm proving this, I think constantly that the product that we are showing people, giving people ability to test it is really important. And getting this feedback, especially early on, is important.
00:07:11.134 - 00:07:11.470, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:11.502 - 00:07:40.244, Speaker B: So let me show you some examples since, you know, this is something that is important. So we will be going to the app synthetic. Synthetic. And this is a platform that is already integrated with the PIV network. So you guys probably already know something about the PIV network. They are providing the oracles for most of the projects and we started using them. Yeah.
00:07:40.244 - 00:08:03.614, Speaker B: So this will be that. So if you want to check out the syntactify, go ahead. App synthetify IO, you can join, you can enter and try testing, try clicking the airdrop. And this should give you like ability to get some tests identified. This is not airdrop like on the mainnet. Please don't confuse it. This is just test tokens.
00:08:03.614 - 00:08:48.414, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is how the, let's say, initial layout is going to use. So you'll be having ability to deposit some assets and you know, after you deposit those assets you will be, you know, getting, you know, your stake value will be increasing and thanks to that you will be, you know, you will be able to mint a synthetic USD, which I'm going to do. Oh, I think it's, there is still some problems validation. So sorry about that. But this is super early version with integration of the PIV network. So we are still, you know, improving stuff.
00:08:48.414 - 00:09:30.202, Speaker B: Yeah. So right now my collateral ratio is super high. It's 1800, but, and my debt is about $50 but it's constantly changing. Every, every block there's new updates. So your debt is changing, you know, every block. And you know, this is really important for, you know, exchanges like this because right now if you are staking the tokens and you are having a debt, you're kind of participating in a deadpool which gives you ability to earn staking rewards and also the exchange fees. But it will kind of force you to take opposite sides of the people that are trading here are going to perform some trade.
00:09:30.202 - 00:10:08.944, Speaker B: So for example, let's exchange synthetic USD to synthetic salt. As you can see, the price of the salt is consciously trading. As I mentioned, this is updating every subsecond so the updates are super frequent. And in that case there is probably zero possibilities of front rank. So you get a window on your extension. We are using Phantom as an extension since it's probably most advanced and yeah, that's it. You got your token, you can also exchange to other tokens.
00:10:08.944 - 00:10:40.550, Speaker B: For example, we can exchange Sol to zero and there is zero cross exchange. You are basically exchanging those two assets directly as there is a pair, and there is zero slippage, of course. And, yeah, that's it. You know, transactions are settled in a matter of seconds, you know, the longer it takes to, you know, the confirmation window to pop up and. Yeah, I think that's it. Are there any questions?
00:10:40.732 - 00:10:58.410, Speaker A: Yeah, any questions in the chat? We'll give him a couple more minutes because he got on a bit late. So if anyone has a question here, please put it in the twitch chat and we'll ask Norbert. Norbert, thank you so much for the demo. Really excited to see this. It's been really cool for context, for everyone that maybe doesn't know, Norbert has been in the serum discourse since the very beginning.
00:10:58.522 - 00:11:22.626, Speaker B: Norbert has also been the person who is Alpha testing the anchor. I think that synthetic is like the first, I don't want to say like over coffee, that's. But, you know, the first major project that is building on, on anchor, and it's really great. I'm, you know, shilling, you know, anchor to everybody. This is the way to go. Definitely.
00:11:22.810 - 00:11:42.988, Speaker A: Yeah. Norbert's been helping Armani a bunch with anchor, so he's just been a big contributor to the whole ecosystem, not just the projects he's building. Want to tell you, Norbert, we're really grateful for all of that, and it's a real pleasure to have you here building with us. Does anyone have any questions? Oh, someone's asking. Norbert got enough support to keep working on this full time.
00:11:43.116 - 00:12:15.020, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm actually, you probably guys don't know this, but I also won the first hackathon, and since first hackathon, I quit my job and been working on, let's say, working like preparing for a next hackathon. Also, I'm working on this full time. There's more people that are working full time, and definitely there is going to a lot of more people in the future, since I'm, you know, I would be expanding a team and there is cool stuff that I am going to build. Definitely. Yeah.
00:12:15.052 - 00:12:29.472, Speaker A: And no need to be super humble. So just for the listeners, Norbert's actually already hired several people to his team. They got an office in Poland. They're moving into the office here soon. So we're talking like, official full time team building this out. Very excited to see how it grows in the Solana ecosystem.
00:12:29.548 - 00:12:55.508, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I see some questions. Oh, I think there is some question about mercurial finance. I think Mercury finance are focusing on a stable assets, so. But we are focusing on mostly on, like, all the assets and, you know, the exchange between them. Great.
00:12:55.556 - 00:13:09.124, Speaker A: Let's see. Any last question? No, that's about it. Norbert, would you. Are you. Are you. I don't know if you're on the Twitch, actually, but Twitter for synthetic, just so people can go, I will post it.
00:13:09.204 - 00:13:18.820, Speaker B: I'll post it in a second. Like, here it is. Here's why. You can, like, adjust it.
00:13:19.012 - 00:13:21.564, Speaker A: You can put your discord there as well. Yeah.
00:13:21.604 - 00:13:42.104, Speaker B: You can also follow me on my, let's say, personal Twitter, since, you know, there is, like, I'm spending there. I actually lost control over, let's say, you know, the synthetic Twitter. I moved to my own, probably. It's not good to be a developer and managing Twitter, so I'm kind of no longer controlling the synthetic Twitter.
00:13:43.724 - 00:13:48.980, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much for coming on, Norbert. All right, next up is the Solrise team, Solrise finance.
00:13:49.012 - 00:13:49.292, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:13:49.348 - 00:13:50.124, Speaker A: Thanks, Norbert. Bye.
