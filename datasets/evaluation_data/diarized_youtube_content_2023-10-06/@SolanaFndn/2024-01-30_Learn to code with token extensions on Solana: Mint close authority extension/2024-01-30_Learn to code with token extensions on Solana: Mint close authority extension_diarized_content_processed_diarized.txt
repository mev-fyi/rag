00:00:00.200 - 00:00:37.034, Speaker A: Have you ever accidentally made a token and needed to close it to reclaim your rent? With the previous token program, this was impossible. Now with token extensions, you can use the Mint close authority extension to add an authority that can close the mint and reclaim the rent. This is great for temporary tokens that you only need for a short period of time. Do note though, you can only close the mint if the supply is zero, so all tokens must be burnt prior to closing the mint. This is to prevent any accidental closures. You can try out the Mint close authority extension in other token extensions today.
