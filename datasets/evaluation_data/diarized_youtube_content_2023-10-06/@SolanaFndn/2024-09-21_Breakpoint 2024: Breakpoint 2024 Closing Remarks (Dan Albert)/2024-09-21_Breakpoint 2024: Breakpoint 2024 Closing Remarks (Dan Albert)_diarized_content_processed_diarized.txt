00:00:05.320 - 00:00:48.285, Speaker A: All right. Oh, my goodness. Breakpoint 2024. Wow. Wow. This is the fourth year we've done this and it gets better every time. I have had the luxury of being on this stage a number of times, and it's really so humbling to me, all of you here supporting this idea, this vision, this crazy thing called Solana and the brighter future that I believe, and I think we all believe we can build together.
00:00:48.285 - 00:01:36.065, Speaker A: And so I just wanted to say thank you all so much for being here this week, for being with us on Twitter, on Discord Online, at the Hacker Houses, whatever that thing is. Being with us for the ups and the downs and all the drama and all the challenges, it just really means so much to me. You know, I was just here talking about Solana foundation and all the stuff we do and are we good? Are we bad? But ultimately, Solana is what matters and you are Solana. And so whether I'm at Foundation or somewhere else, like you all will always hold a really special place in my heart. So thank you. And I just wanted to give a couple quick call outs. Breakpoint.
00:01:36.065 - 00:02:46.375, Speaker A: This year, this has been our biggest Break Point ever. This has definitely been the best Break Point ever, possibly, if Twitter is to believe, possibly the best event in crypto ever. This week we had over 6,000 attendees from all over the world, over 75 product announcements, eight ancillary summits, single day side events, and 700 conference extensions. We really have critical mass and Breakpoint feels like a big family reunion. And it's just so awesome to see people who've been here, new people that I got to meet for the very first time, people that I've seen for years in cities and countries all over the world. Solana is family, and it's really, we're building something great together. So this has been an Incredible Break Point 2024, and it's been great to be here in Asia, in Singapore, and we did Breakpoint for the last three years in Europe.
00:02:46.375 - 00:03:53.235, Speaker A: We were in Lisbon for a couple years, Amsterdam last year. Now we're here in Singapore. And for us and for the Solana community and for the growing global community, it's really important that we keep Breakpoint going. And I'm really excited to tell you about Breakpoint 2025 coming next year. It's not just important for the community that Solana is global and breakpoint is global, but that we can showcase and partner with and support regions and jurisdictions that support the technology that we're trying to build, that are working proactively to pass regulation and legislation that is in support of all of the things that we love and all the things that we believe in. And so really excited to bring to you next year Breakpoint 2025 in Abu Dhabi. It's going to be super exciting, y'all really excited.
00:03:53.235 - 00:04:16.275, Speaker A: And we wouldn't be here without you guys. So thank you from the bottom of my heart. This means so much to me. This concludes Breakpoint 2024. We will see you for the after party. Check your email, check your apps. All the information is there.
00:04:16.275 - 00:04:17.975, Speaker A: Thank you. Good night.
