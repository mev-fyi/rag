00:00:00.280 - 00:00:40.810, Speaker A: I think tickets have evolved with technology from the telephone to the Internet to mobile. And every time a new technology opens up another opportunity for people to get in the middle of fans and the artists that they want to buy tickets for. We believe that fans need to have a richer experience with the artists that they love. All these companies see the fans as transactions, not people, and we really want to allow the fans to bring themselves to the table. Hi, I'm Mike Saunders, CEO of XP. We are a sports and concert ticketing exchange giving power back to the fans. We've seeded the marketplace with 50 million tickets from brokers at 30% cheaper prices than you'll pay from incumbent marketplaces.
00:00:40.810 - 00:00:50.778, Speaker A: We believe that with enough transparency, we can create a true fair market value for the fans. This technology around blockchain forces a more level playing field for people like me.
00:00:50.794 - 00:01:02.402, Speaker C: Who are web3 native XP is really cool because you're not only able to pay in credit cards, debit cards, but you're also able to pay in USCC. So not only does it eliminate credit card fees, but you can instantly see your transaction confirm and get a different asset in return.
00:01:02.546 - 00:01:12.058, Speaker B: Buying a ticket on XP is seamless. Buying a ticket on other platforms is stressful. There's no hidden fees. So whenever you see a ticket price as you're scrolling, that's the price that you're going to get.
00:01:12.114 - 00:01:23.338, Speaker D: There's nothing better than going to a live show. It's really what brings me alive. It's an experience that I cherish with my friends, family and everyone. And now with XP, I get to go. They're cheaper, faster, easier, and it's more transparent.
00:01:23.394 - 00:01:25.930, Speaker A: I got tickets on XP. Absolute game changer.
00:01:26.010 - 00:01:37.502, Speaker B: The ideal experience around finding tickets for a show. You can expect what you're promised you getting to the show, making those memories should be just about that. That's the experience that I want.
00:01:37.566 - 00:01:56.380, Speaker A: We see a world where fans, in owning their data, can connect more with merch drops, with really custom events and experiences that are tailored just for them. If you're a fan of any artist or comedian or team, you should be buying your tickets on Xpath.
