00:00:04.280 - 00:00:30.130, Speaker A: Today, I'm joined by Aiden Neal from Ladderlabs. So, please tell us, what are you building? Yeah, so we built Laddercaster, the first fully on chain game on Solana, and we built buddy Link, a fully on chain referral and attribution protocol. Awesome. I remember the game. So what does buddy Link do? So, buddy Link lets any business, no matter what product vertical, set up any kinds of referrals they want. And eventually, we'll also have other engagement tools, like loyalty point systems, battle passes, and all kinds of other stuff, and all on chain, fully on chain. Awesome.
00:00:30.130 - 00:00:35.354, Speaker A: That sounds really composable. It is. We're trying to get there as fast as we can. Awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
