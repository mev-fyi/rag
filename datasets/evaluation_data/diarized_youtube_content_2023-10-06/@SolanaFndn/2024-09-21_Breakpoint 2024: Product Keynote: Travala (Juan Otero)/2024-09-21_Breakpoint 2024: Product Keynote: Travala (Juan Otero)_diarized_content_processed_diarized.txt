00:00:05.520 - 00:00:31.585, Speaker A: Afternoon everyone. Well, I love the energy in this room. Let me start by asking you a quick question. How many of you here today have booked a hotel, a flight or any other travel product in the last month? Raise your hands please. Wow, that's almost the whole room. So just like you hear today, there's 1.5 billion people, people that have booked a travel product in the last 12 months alone.
00:00:31.585 - 00:01:23.433, Speaker A: And that's exactly the audience that we're targeting here at Travala. Travala, powered by its native token, Ava is the leading Web3 travel booking platform. We set on a mission to target these 1.5 billion travelers and change the way they experience travel with Web3 technology. And when we ask ourselves the question, who can bring the next billion users to crypto, we believe that the answer is travala. With over 3 million travel products globally, we have processed over quarter of a billion dollars worth of bookings to date and reach over 300,000 monthly active users. We see Travala becoming a crypto hub for millions of travelers across the world.
00:01:23.433 - 00:02:11.137, Speaker A: A place where they can connect with the world, with each other and themselves. And why? Because travel does make us better humans. It encourages curiosity, it encourages us to be more open minded and also more understanding. We want to give everyone access to these life changing opportunities in a simple and rewarding way through the power of Web3. So now for the exciting part. Yeah, Travala is coming to Solana. It is my pleasure to announce here today that the Solana network has already been integrated.
00:02:11.137 - 00:03:44.905, Speaker A: Travala. We have several assets including USDT and USDC on the Solana network as well as Sol, obviously with zero transaction fees available on the Travala platform. The AVA foundation has also deployed the AVA Token on the Solana Network following a recent community vote. But yeah, let me show you what it looks like, how seamless it is to book travel with Travala. Cool, eh? Yeah. So I got another question for you guys. What is the point in continuing to use, you know, booking, booking, expedia.
00:03:44.905 - 00:04:43.981, Speaker A: So on where you can book with Travala, you can pay with crypto, you can support the industry where you get the best deals and you get real rewards. It's kind of a no brainer, isn't it? So next up, something I'm very excited to introduce here today is the Open Loyalty, the world's first interconnected Web3 loyalty program for the entire Solana ecosystem. Powered by the Ava Token, this program will bring on chain loyalty to Solana for the first time. Something that is really having an impact. The AVA Smart program already has around 30,000 Smart members so we are off to a very good start. Start with this program and we will allow Solana projects to plug and play to get access to a lot of these members. So what is the AVA Smart program? It's a Web3 travel loyalty program that offers benefits from discounts to gift bags, airdrops and so on.
00:04:43.981 - 00:05:46.065, Speaker A: If you're a top tier member of the smart program holding a travel tiger NFT, you also get access to over 1,300 airport lounges across the world, incredible travel experiences and much much more. You also can get up to 13% back on your bookings in Ava Bitcoin and soon also Solana or Sol Sorry. So if you a project within the Solana ecosystem, come join us as we push forward with crypto adoption. We can offer more utility to your token by integrating as a preferred payment method on the platform. We can also partner with you to give more visibility to your project by doing member airdrops or cross marketing initiatives.
