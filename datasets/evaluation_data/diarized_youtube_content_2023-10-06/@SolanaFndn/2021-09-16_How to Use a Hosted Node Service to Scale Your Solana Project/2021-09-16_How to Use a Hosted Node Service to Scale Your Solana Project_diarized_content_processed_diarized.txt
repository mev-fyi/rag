00:00:09.800 - 00:00:28.224, Speaker A: Everybody, welcome to another ignition hackathon event. Joining us today, we have Amul and Zahil from quick node. They're going to run through some node infrastructure stuff, talk about RPC, I'm sure. And they have a great presentation prepared for you. Amal, sahil, kick it off.
00:00:29.284 - 00:00:52.864, Speaker B: Thanks, Ryan. I appreciate you having us here. We're so excited just to talk to you guys in terms of just how Quicknode can help you in terms of winning this hackathon. So thank you for having us. My name is Amul Shah, the VP of revenue here at Quicknode. I'm joined by my partner in crime, Sahil, who's our developer evangelist. Let him say hello.
00:00:53.544 - 00:00:55.004, Speaker C: Hey. Hey, guys.
00:00:56.144 - 00:01:40.654, Speaker B: And so today, what we wanted to cover with you all is just an introduction. So what the heck is node services? We'll talk a little bit about that. How I explain it to my mom, how node services can help you in terms of shipping your project faster so you can win this hackathon. Then Sahil will walk you all through a how to demo, so you can check out some of the features that Quicknode offers and then play around with it in a little bit more detail. Just in terms of who is quick node and what is nodes as a service. So we are a proud Miami based blockchain startup. What we do is we provide nodes as a service.
00:01:40.654 - 00:02:51.028, Speaker B: What is that? In order to access the blockchain, or to read to the blockchain, or to the right to the blockchain, you need something called a node or an endpoint. And what quick node does is we provide essentially the services to connect to those nodes or endpoints in the same way that you have all of these different apps that are built on top of Amazon or Azure. What Quicknote is attempting to do is basically being this infrastructure layer that helps a lot of amazing web3 projects connect to the blockchain. So the best way of describing it sometimes is just, we're the picks and shovels of this ecosystem, and we have a bunch of amazing investors and backing. So we will be around and we're hoping to scale as you all scale. So three big takeaways in terms of just how node providers like quick node can help you. So one is in terms of when you are building an endpoint, you can either build it in house and that takes a lot of time and effort, or you can use a public endpoint.
00:02:51.028 - 00:03:43.214, Speaker B: But there's all sorts of issues which we'll go into in terms of why public endpoints can sometimes be difficult and challenging and so if you use a service like quick node, you don't have rate limits. And that's really important when you're scaling up your project or app scale in terms of being able to handle major spikes in demand. If you're an NFT project and you have a big drop coming up, or if you are an eco or if you're doing an ICO or something like that, usually you see big spikes in demand, so you want a service that can handle it. And then lastly there's pricing, which is elastic. And so as you use more of the service, as you get more customers, then you have access to volume discounts. At the same time, if you're not having a lot of demand, then you don't need to pay as much either. So that's pretty flexible from a project owner standpoint.
00:03:43.214 - 00:04:26.932, Speaker B: You know, don't take our word for it. So I just crib this from one of the presentations just yesterday. And so it was from Tristan at Zeta. They won the hackathon last time. Right. And so at the end of the day, right. The most important thing is how can we help you go to market faster and how can you help you win the hackathon? So one of his slides, and it was a real key story during his presentation yesterday around how to win your first Solana hackathon was basically around just how RPC, how the setup for that was something which took a lot of time.
00:04:26.932 - 00:05:45.492, Speaker B: And so he described how they decided or they didn't know about these nodes as a service types of offerings. And so they tried to build this in house, and they were up until 02:00 in the morning. You can see that picture on the right where they were linking together a bunch of their different computers to different hotspots so that they weren't facing rate limits, which they were dealing with because they were using the public endpoint. And so the biggest takeaway is if you don't want to be up until 02:00 in the morning when you are launching your project and you only have, I think, four weeks until the end of this hackathon, use a service like quicknode, because what we can do is we can avoid situations like what's on the right. That's the simplest way of trying to describe it, and it's a way for you to go to market faster and sooner. And there's just a couple of other things in terms of just some feedback that we've gotten from some major customers. So Solana, Sols and Solmanders, two major NFT projects, use quick node to power their drops and they were able to handle the sort of the high spikes in demand, something which is really important.
00:05:45.492 - 00:06:29.220, Speaker B: And so we're pretty proud about that. And then lastly, it goes back to the elastic pricing model. That's something which is really important, right? Because as you're thinking about how to not have a ton of upfront costs, if you're not thinking about spending all your developers time building a node in house, use something like nodes as a service, use something like quick node where essentially you have the ability to flex your cost structure. And that's something which we're really excited to bring to the community. I think last thing though is for everybody, that's part of this hackathon. So we worked with the team over at the Solana foundation. The best price is free.
00:06:29.220 - 00:07:08.944, Speaker B: So we're able to offer quick node and the access, full access to Solana Mainnet, Testnet or devnet to all the different participants of this hackathon. So definitely check us out. There's a link which you can see there, quicknode.com, solanahackathon. There's also the dev post that is that a lot of you all are accessing to get information in terms of resources and things like that, you'll find a link there. It's trial, no weight limits or anything to any of the quick node services. You can have your own Solana endpoint booted up and ready to go.
00:07:08.944 - 00:07:39.184, Speaker B: So in case you missed it, rate limits are terrible. And so just sort of an endorsement and a shout out from our good friend Anatoly over at the Solana foundation, check out quick node. It's definitely an alternative, and I think it's going to be a way for you all to scale up your projects faster to avoid those 02:00 a.m.. Moments. And with that, let me turn it over to Sahil who can give you a demo in terms of just how the service works.
00:07:40.494 - 00:08:15.340, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you so much, Amol. And that was a great representation of what quicknode does and what a hosted node provider is. So let me just quickly show you how to sign up for quicknode and then just give you a small demo of how to use your quicknode in your project. So let me share my screen right now. All right, so once you're on the quicknode.com website, just fill in your details and create the account and verify your email. Once you have done that, you should be presented with a page similar to this.
00:08:15.340 - 00:09:04.218, Speaker C: But you won't be having any nodes because your account will be a new one. So you'll have to go to create node, select any plan which you like based on the limits or based on the calls you want to make. I'm just going for the launch plan over here. And then select the chain. So Solana obviously, and then select the network so that we have mainnet, Testnet and Devnet, all of those supported and then continue repelling and then just fill out the details and that's it, you should be having a node. And now let me show you how the node dashboard actually looks. So you just have to click on nodes once you have set up your node and it will load up the notes page and let me find a Solana node real quick for you.
00:09:04.218 - 00:09:54.156, Speaker C: So right here, this node, frostry floral river is a Solana node. So once you have set up your Solana node, it looks something similar to this. And you'll be having a HTTP provider, a websocket provider. You can simply click here to copy the provider URL and plug it into your apps. So with quicknode you don't just get the URL's of HTTP and WebSocket providers, but you also get additional features like metrics, security billing and help. So you'll be having visibility into the number of calls you have made, the latest block, the client your validator is using, and you'll be also having the method call breakdown in this page. But this is an internal node so that's why it's omitted.
00:09:54.156 - 00:10:44.816, Speaker C: And now let's look at the security features. So we have a bunch of security features to make sure that you are the only person in possession of your node, right? So you can turn on and off the token based authentication which is right here. This is the token, this random number of string, this is the token. You can turn that on and off from here. You can even roll that token. So if you ever feel that someone else has possession of your node, you can simply roll the token and the old URL won't work anymore and you'll have a new URL. You can also add reference in your node so that just the website which you are using, or just the website of your project who is making direct requests to the node will be having access to the node.
00:10:44.816 - 00:11:30.662, Speaker C: No other website or no other system can have access to the node after that you can also mask the node so that you can have a custom URL of your node which is right here. And that's it. You can then go to help. And yeah, you will have, you'll be, have, you'll be presented with the different guides and blogs we have right here. So now let's quickly see how we can actually use this node. Right, so I have this really simple HTML and J's file, which is a small Solana block explorer. So this is just a basic boilerplate HTML code.
00:11:30.662 - 00:12:41.434, Speaker C: And the main part, which is right here, I am importing the Solana web3 J's library over here, and then I am importing the node which is over here. So you just have to replace this part, which says, add your quick node here with your quick node URL, and that's it. So let me quickly explain all the other functions which are used in this. So I've simply used a set interval function of JavaScript to run this script after five ms, which is milliseconds. So after that, I am using the get epoch function to get the current epoch, and then printing the absolute slot block height epoch and the transaction count of that epoch into different columns. So let me quickly run this file for you. So now they should start giving out e purchase.
00:12:41.434 - 00:13:13.894, Speaker C: Okay, I think I have not saved the file. All right. Okay. I think I'm having some problem with my node, so let me just quickly do one thing. I'm so sorry. Till then, amul, you can explain them about the archive feature of the Solana nodes we have.
00:13:15.154 - 00:14:21.310, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So this is something which we're really excited about. So for, this isn't a feature that everybody uses, but for analytics providers, for people who are looking at historical data from, like, if you're looking at old trades, things like that, most node services, they usually provide just the last 128 blocks, the most recent blocks, that's what you typically get when you access, like a node through infuria or some other kind of service like that. Full node services take a lot of resources, a lot of time, a lot of effort, and so it's not something which is really offered. But we just recently announced that we are, I think, one of the only ones that's providing archive mode access to Solana. And so that means that you get all historical data going all the way back to the first block. And so that is something which has, I think, a lot of value for certain applications and users, and it's something which we just announced a couple weeks ago.
00:14:21.310 - 00:14:40.594, Speaker B: And so you can check it out. In fact, anybody who accesses quick node through the sort of the trial that we have for all the Solana, this hackathon, would have access to the archive data as well. So we're throwing that in, check it out, let us know what you think.
00:14:42.974 - 00:15:47.574, Speaker C: Yeah. So let me quickly get to the Solana explorer. I just need one moment. All right, so I have it right here. Let me quickly share my screen. Okay, so as you can see, this script is printing out new purchase after every five millisecond. And the columns which you can see are, this is the absolute slot, this is the block number, this is the epoch, and this is the transaction count of that particular epoch.
00:15:47.574 - 00:16:18.584, Speaker C: So this should be the latest block right now, which is block height. And. Yeah, it's that simple. It's just plug and play. You just have to copy the URL from the quick node dashboard and then in your application and you'll be good. So say, yeah, but it's just plug and play. And I will go on talking about more benefits of the quick node API.
00:16:18.584 - 00:16:56.484, Speaker C: With the quick node API, you get access to the global network, to our global network of nodes, so that if a cluster in an area goes down, you have fallover or failover benefits. So that your requests are always served. We make sure that your requests are always served. Even if a cluster in your region goes down, it may take some while to your request to get served, because your request getting routed from another region, but it's always served. So, yeah, I'll quickly close this and go to the last slide. Amal?
00:16:57.184 - 00:17:06.284, Speaker B: Yes. Quick question. I just seen this. Is there a way that you can show us the previous step where you plugged in the quick node RPC URL?
00:17:06.864 - 00:17:07.699, Speaker C: Yeah, sure.
00:17:07.831 - 00:17:12.983, Speaker B: Everyone's benefit. I think there was an issue where we're trying to share the whole screen.
00:17:14.283 - 00:17:53.774, Speaker C: All right, so I'm hoping that my screen is visible now. Yep. Okay, so it was right here. Oh, by the way, I'll be sharing, like, I'll be sharing the link to this repository for this Solana explorer in the discord of the hackathon. So, like, if any one of you wants to hack with this or build on top of this, you can do that. So it's right here on line 67. So I'm just instantiating a Solana web3 object and then connecting it to HTTP provider, which is quick node.
00:17:53.774 - 00:18:05.584, Speaker C: So let me again copy the URL. So you just have to click this button, copy the URL, and plug it right here, and that's it.
00:18:05.884 - 00:18:08.824, Speaker B: Thank you. Vivid underscore truth. Appreciate it.
00:18:11.924 - 00:18:13.664, Speaker C: Do we have any other questions?
00:18:24.684 - 00:18:50.304, Speaker B: I think we got everybody. So the huge benefit is it's as easy as it can be. So the good thing is you guys can all check it out and let us know in terms of how you think about it, what you feel if you use it for any of your projects. We're excited in terms of seeing all the output that comes out of this hackathon. Super excited to be part of the Solana ecosystem. It's an amazing time. So thanks everyone.
00:18:51.204 - 00:19:11.596, Speaker C: Yeah, and make sure to follow us on Twitter and check our guide section. We post daily guides to help our community, and we are also coming up with new Solana guides. We already have a few of them right now and we will be coming with more soon. So thank you everyone. Thanks, Rand. Thanks Solana foundation yeah, thank you both for joining.
00:19:11.660 - 00:19:21.804, Speaker A: Really great demo and hopefully people will check out Quicknode. This will be uploaded to YouTube. Thanks again everybody for joining.
