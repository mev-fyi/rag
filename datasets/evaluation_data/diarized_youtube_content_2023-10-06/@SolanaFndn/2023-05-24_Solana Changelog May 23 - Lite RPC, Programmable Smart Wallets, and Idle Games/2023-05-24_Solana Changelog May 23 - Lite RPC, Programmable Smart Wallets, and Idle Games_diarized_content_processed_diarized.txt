00:00:00.360 - 00:00:37.320, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's Changelog, where we talk about the changes on Solana Week by week. My name is Jacob, and I'm joined today by Colin. And let's get started. So this past week there was another core community call. The core community call is a call amongst the core protocol developers on Solana talking about the upcoming changes and features that they need to agree on in line to build their different clients. So, as you may know, may know, there are currently two clients being built right now, or at least two clients. There's the labs client that the Solana labs team is building, and then there's the fire dancer client that the jump team is building.
00:00:37.320 - 00:01:14.934, Speaker A: There's also the Geeto client, which is kind of like an addition on top of the labs client that's being built. And with the core community call, they're basically agreeing on the implementation of different things. So this past week, they were talking about a optimistic restart automation. So what this was is a way for the different clients to agree upon a optimistically confirmed slot in the case of issues on the cluster. Okay, Colin, and what was the SRFC that you saw this week?
00:01:15.274 - 00:02:05.544, Speaker B: Yes. So today we're going to highlight SRFC zero, zero nine, which is titled sign in with programmable wallets using off chain delegates. And I guess the problem that this particular SRFC is trying to solve is that there are some programmable wallets that don't have a corresponding private key. Therefore it's like somewhat very difficult to be able to authenticate a user. So this is suggesting that there's a particular delegate that can be made to a key pair, and that particular key pair can sign on behalf of the programmable wallet. So I think this is probably a problem that is plaguing multisync wallets mainly. So, yeah, begin to address that particular problem.
00:02:06.564 - 00:03:11.758, Speaker A: Right. I think this is very related to all the hype recently about account abstraction in the ethereum community, which what's great about account abstraction on Solana is that it's always been available on Solana. With PDA's, you can always do account abstraction and I guess CPI as well. This is improving on that. Something to note about srfcs, for those that do not know, these are just standards that are application standards for people to implement and agree upon. So things like how to sign in with a programmable smart wallet using off chain delegates, that's something that people want to agree upon so that different wallets within the ecosystem can implement the same standard. What this kind of gets into is that, like, you don't need a protocol change for the majority of srfcs, especially with this one where programmable wallets are already a possibility on Solana, you can just do it.
00:03:11.758 - 00:03:30.166, Speaker A: And if you have like say for example, if the top wallets implemented, it would take, it would just, that's all it would take them to implement it. It would take no actual protocol change. So that goes back to account abstraction, even though it's a new big thing on Ethereum, has always been possible in.
00:03:30.190 - 00:04:26.844, Speaker B: Solana because we're talking about the ability to authenticate. Users probably just want to take this opportunity to plug in the authorization spec that is part of the Solana pay repo. I think there's been a ton of work that's been done on that particular spec that is almost like somewhat related to this in almost to have a particular way for, almost like for the client that you have to be able to sign in with your mobile wallet and just like a quick plug, if the current wallets on Solana can take a look at that particular spec so that we can begin to get some kind of adoption from the wallet side. Because in terms of like the spec, it's already written out. There's already a reference wallet implementation for that as well. So please check that out so we can get some adoption on actual wallets that users use.
00:04:27.544 - 00:04:59.390, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be awesome. And then the commit that I saw this past week is that there was a different way to get the leader schedule up to one epoch in the future. This is so that people can kind of understand of what the current leader schedule will be in the upcoming epoch. It gives them a lot more information. This can also be helped out with testing. It can kind of give you an idea of you as a leader, how you're going to do, etcetera. So it's a really cool commit.
00:04:59.390 - 00:05:10.974, Speaker A: I'm glad that and what? I'm glad that someone was able to do it. And not only that, it was someone within the community, not someone at like the labs, fire dancer, jito or mango team, which is really cool.
00:05:11.134 - 00:05:12.054, Speaker B: Yep, cool.
00:05:12.094 - 00:05:15.094, Speaker A: And then what kind of resources have you seen this week?
00:05:15.254 - 00:06:19.074, Speaker B: Yes, so the resource of the week that I saw was around clockwork and Soulplay. Jonas, who's one of the dev rails at foundation, created like a tutorial on how to build a game using clockwork. So if you want to learn a bit into how clockwork works and also want to build a cool game, definitely check out this, this resource that exists. The second one that I saw was the light RPC by manga markets, and it's kind of like purports to be a more efficient way, or, sorry, it's slightly more efficient to send and confirm transactions than the typical RPC is. So this is not to actually replace RPC providers, it's just a way to reduce the load on the RPC infrastructure itself. So definitely check that out. And if you want almost like, faster confirmation times, that's the route to go down.
00:06:19.894 - 00:06:43.194, Speaker A: Yeah, those really, both of those resources are really cool. So part of Jonas is what he's creating. So he created an idle game. That's the resource. Right. What he's been doing is he's been building different genres of games and putting him into the game development kit on the Solana developers.org and then on the RPC lite client.
00:06:43.194 - 00:07:13.754, Speaker A: It's kind of like it takes less hardware to run an RPC node with that, which is great. Like, that's a huge thing, and it will allow more people to run RPC clients that couldn't possibly do it before. So two awesome resources this week. Glad to have them. So, yeah, thank you all for joining us this week on the Solana Changelog. Come join us next week where we will talk more changes on Solana. Adios.
00:07:13.914 - 00:07:18.754, Speaker B: Out. Don't forget to join us on Fridays for our Twitter spaces called Devrel chat.
