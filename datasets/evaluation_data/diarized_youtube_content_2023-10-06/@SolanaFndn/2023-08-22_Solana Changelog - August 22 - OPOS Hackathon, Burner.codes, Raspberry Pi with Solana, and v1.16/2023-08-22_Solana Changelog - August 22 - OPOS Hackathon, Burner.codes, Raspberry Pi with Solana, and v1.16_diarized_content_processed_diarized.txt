00:00:00.600 - 00:00:17.518, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. Welcome, everyone, to this week's Changelog, where we talk about the changes week by week on Solana. My name is Jacob. I'm joined today by Nick. And let's get started. So this week, what we had is we had the Opos hackathon finish up.
00:00:17.518 - 00:01:00.734, Speaker A: So this is a only possible on Solana hackathon hosted by Lamport Dao. So it should have finished yesterday on Monday. And what you can do is you can go check out all the submissions. If you're interested in seeing what was built and if anybody actually participated in this hackathon, please go out on Twitter and tweet about your project, talk about what you built, how you built it, and what's special about it. We would love to see what people have built, and we want to also know more of, we want to know ahead of time, of like, what is special about it. And we're more than happy to retweet it if you tag one of us. What do you think, Nick? Did you build anything this time?
00:01:01.314 - 00:01:35.114, Speaker B: I did build some stuff. I have yet to submit it, but we'll see how it goes. But I'm really excited to see what the rest of the community builds. I think something's going to be, there's probably going to be some really cool stuff built out of it, I guess kind of in tandem with the oposs hackathon. I did build this burner codes thing wasn't necessarily for the hackathon, but just for all the workshops and things that are going on in the ecosystem to help out the ecosystem. But it's at burner codes. It's this cool little app to actually create a burner wallet directly just within your browser.
00:01:35.114 - 00:01:55.666, Speaker B: Really. There's no download, no app, just your browser. Open it and go. And it's on Solana Devnet. You can get Devnet Soul. You can request an airdrop using standard web3 Js. And the cool thing is you can send Devnet Soul to anybody, either directly to their address or using a link, which I think is just like a really cool thing.
00:01:55.666 - 00:02:01.346, Speaker B: You can scan a little QR code, transfer some soul around. It'll be a really cool thing.
00:02:01.530 - 00:02:21.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm looking forward to using this at like, hackathons, like in person hackathons that we go to for sure, as well as like, events. It'll help out a lot with getting Devnet sold to people so they can try out demos and try Solana for the first time. What do you think your plans are for the future of burner codes?
00:02:22.014 - 00:02:44.394, Speaker B: I think the easy to do list that's on it is direct camera integration and Solanapay support. So you'll be able to launch your camera directly from the website itself. Again, still no download, and then you'll be able to scan Solanape QR codes, interact. You'll probably see some more stuff coming out in the next month or so for it. Little teaser there.
00:02:45.014 - 00:02:56.494, Speaker A: That'll be super exciting to see this evolve. And also it's open source, so if anybody wants to contribute to it, go ahead and go to GitHub or go to burnout codes and just go click on the open source link at the bottom.
00:02:57.314 - 00:03:04.018, Speaker B: Have you seen any other cool projects come out? I mean, there was the really cool deep end style project from Jonas on the dev rel team.
00:03:04.146 - 00:03:18.460, Speaker A: Yes, there was a deep end project. So skipping over to his project, there was a really cool project that Jonas built that was basically showcasing what's possible with hardware in Solana, as you can see here.
00:03:18.572 - 00:03:19.388, Speaker B: So cool.
00:03:19.516 - 00:03:52.478, Speaker A: It's really cool. He just has a proof of concept of like a light bulb turning on and off with Solana pay transactions. And this small idea is just suddenly blown up into like, oh my gosh, I can do so much more with this. And he has an example on GitHub for you to use, as well as the installation instructions of how he did it. So you can try it out with just your led or you can move on to. I think people were talking about putting this in like vending machines to.
00:03:52.526 - 00:03:53.582, Speaker B: Oh, that's really cool.
00:03:53.678 - 00:04:30.598, Speaker A: Yeah, I was thinking of some things that like, you can go around with the, like, maybe you have like some deep pin vending machine thing. This maybe is a bad idea. Maybe it's a good idea. But you have like a way that you can use vending machines to basically, like, instead of one person owns it, you can stock it up and get your payment based off of the, the ones that are sold that you stocked up. And then you have to put some deposit to open all sorts of weird things. Anyways, lots of different ideas that you can come up with through Deepin on Solana. So check this out from Jonas.
00:04:30.598 - 00:04:34.194, Speaker A: It'll be on GitHub. We'll put a link in the description if you're interested.
00:04:34.574 - 00:04:47.784, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think the next thing to talk about is what else is going on in the ecosystem. I mean, version 1.16 of Solana is slowly starting to be rolled out. So can you share any details about version 1.16?
00:04:48.244 - 00:05:14.980, Speaker A: Yes. So 1.16 is currently slated for the beginning of September. You can go find the full schedule of 1.16 of what the proposed release schedule is on the Solana GitHub repo. With that said, so right now there's a lot of testing. What they're doing is they're basically pen testing the Testnet cluster with 1.16
00:05:14.980 - 00:05:46.526, Speaker A: and they're downgrading to 1.14, making sure all the same features are set, updating or upgrading from 1.141.16, downgrading again, changing the feature set, doing another upgrade, and just keep doing that while performance testing, pen testing, all sorts of reliability tests to make sure that whenever this upgrade goes on Mainnet there won't be any issues. What do you find interesting out of 1.16? Nick?
00:05:46.630 - 00:06:08.962, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the cool things is confidential transactions, like having this rolled out will be, I think, just like a really great net win for the whole ecosystem. Giving a little bit of extra bit of privacy within the blockchain space in general I think is always a good thing. Like people like privacy and more optionality for developers and consumers is always amazing to see.
00:06:09.138 - 00:06:34.974, Speaker A: Yeah, 1.16 comes with a lot of features with like confidential transactions. Confidential transactions, just to note, is a feature gate. So it might not come out day one, but it will come out soon afterwards. With that said, also, that ties into like token 22. I believe token 22 is waiting on Windows 16 for general recommendation of adoption, which will be really cool to see as well.
00:06:35.274 - 00:06:40.442, Speaker B: All right, I guess that's it for the week. This has been the Solana change log, and thanks for watching.
00:06:40.578 - 00:06:40.954, Speaker A: Thank you.
