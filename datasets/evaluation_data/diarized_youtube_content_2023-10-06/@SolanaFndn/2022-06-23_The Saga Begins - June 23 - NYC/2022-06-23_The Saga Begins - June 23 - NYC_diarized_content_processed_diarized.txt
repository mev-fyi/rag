00:00:30.104 - 00:00:48.664, Speaker A: Wow, look at this. We got a full house today. Well, thank you so much for coming out. I'm Austin Federa. Welcome to New York City. And thanks for joining us for some exciting announcements from Solana Labs. So you may have noticed there's this thing on Twitter called SMS, and we're going to talk about that today.
00:00:48.664 - 00:01:16.614, Speaker A: There's been a little bit of excitement for this. And so you're going to hear from anatoly, you're going to hear from some of the engineering leads. You're going to hear from some builders who are actually using some of the announcements we're going to talk about today. And you're going to hear, really, about what this new stage of growth is for Solana developers. So after the presentation, there'll be some time for questions from the press. There'll be two microphones set up. If time allows, we'll take questions from general audience as well.
00:01:16.614 - 00:01:30.934, Speaker A: But just let the press go ahead and line up beforehand, because that's what they're here to do. Afterwards, we'll have some time to chat downstairs as well, and we can say more about that later. But here's Anatoly.
00:01:43.794 - 00:01:44.574, Speaker B: Wow.
00:01:47.654 - 00:01:48.174, Speaker C: Hi, everyone.
00:01:48.214 - 00:02:31.300, Speaker B: I'm Anatolia Yakovenka, co founder of Solana, CEO of Solana Labs. Sincerely, like, wow. Just thank you guys for joining us. It means a lot to me, like, so much that you guys came. I'm sure there's tons of other places you can be, and it's just awesome that you're here. This is, like, the first time we got this many people together since Lisbon, since breakpoint, you know, last November, less than a year ago, we had, you know, 3000 people show up to Portugal. And this was after, like, almost two years of us building online, never seeing each other face to face and, like, not even knowing, like, are these people real? And when I showed up to Lisbon, it was just incredible.
00:02:31.300 - 00:03:06.040, Speaker B: Like, the energy was magical. Like, meeting people face to face, talking to them, just seeing the devs builds was just awesome. All the devs saw everyone around and decided we got to go find our own spot. And they built the first hacker house, and it was sweaty and dark, and they built a lot of demos. I think there was a $100,000 prize for one of the demos, but it was a really fun experience. So we did hacker houses. And these have become, I think, a cultural movement.
00:03:06.040 - 00:03:41.164, Speaker B: I think at this point, we've been in 15 cities. Dubai, Bangalore, Paris, Prague, Seattle, Miami, New York. There's actually a hacker house happening right now in Barcelona. So why are you guys here. Over 9000 attendees, over 600 demos. Just wild to see this happen and I think it really shows. Solana has the fastest growing developer community in the world.
00:03:41.164 - 00:04:12.864, Speaker B: It's growing at an exponential pace. Number of programs being used on chain, number of repos on GitHub. It's just awesome to see me as an engineer, I just want my technology to be used and this is the biggest thanks that I can get. So our hackathons are not just for, these are not just tinkerers, these are real companies being formed today. 500 million in funding. That's an astounding number. That's more money than Solana raised.
00:04:12.864 - 00:04:48.264, Speaker B: It's crazy. And this is funding coming in from top vc's in the world, funding new businesses, new projects. Some of these companies are going to be the biggest companies in the world in five to ten years. So it's unbelievable to me. Over, yeah, 30,000 participants, nearly 2000 teams formed. It's just awesome. A lot of these folks have never met each other and they just come together at a hackathon and find like minded people on a project that they want to work on.
00:04:48.264 - 00:05:20.972, Speaker B: And some of these teams get funding before the hackathon is even over. And of course, decentralization. So we started with 40 validators in about two years. It's nearly 100 x. Wow. Like, none of this stuff works without decentralization. And I think because of the devs, because of the users that are using those programs, this is what makes the network decentralized.
00:05:20.972 - 00:06:05.534, Speaker B: It's the products that users love that brings everyone else to the network. And devs are doing something. We had ten major releases since launch, and that is a stressful release schedule. Our core devs are busy all the time, and every one of these releases makes the network better, makes it faster, makes it more robust. We have this vision of a single giant global state machine, one giant computer that synchronizes millions of transactions as close to the speed of light as physics allow. It's a magical thing that doesn't exist. But each one of these releases gets us closer and closer to that goal.
00:06:05.534 - 00:06:33.314, Speaker B: And why are we doing this? It's for the users. Go to Nansen, look at the numbers that they report. This is the industry standard in multi chain analytics. We have the. I think we've eclipsed every other chain. Some of these peaks have been bigger than all the other chains combined. Wow.
00:06:33.314 - 00:07:14.866, Speaker B: So there's one thing that I rave about all the time, one metric that I really care about more than others, and this is the hardest one, this is the number of full self custody users on Solana. These are folks that have for some reason figured out cryptography. They learn how to store seed phrase, they know how to sign transactions, they understand self custody. And this is the biggest blocker to growth in crypto. How many people actually know how to do this? This may seem impossible, but go back 30 years. Nineties Internet, nobody knew what a web link was. Nobody had a mental model for the web.
00:07:14.866 - 00:07:54.284, Speaker B: It's a complicated thing, but slowly but surely people figured it out. And you saw explosive growth in a number of users on the Internet that led to the great big tech companies that exist today. I think the same thing is going to happen in crypto and I think that because we see the same exponential growth, people figure this stuff out, they get a mental model. They don't need to understand elliptical cryptography, but they understand what self custody means. They understand understand transactions. And it's driven by all these amazing use cases. Gaming, nfTs, social defi payments, daos, hundreds of projects on every use case grow every day.
00:07:54.284 - 00:08:27.252, Speaker B: But wow, nfTs. Yeah, we launched Solana. We called it blockchain and Nasdaq. Speed had nothing to do with nfts. In fact, nfts have only been live since May last year and none of us expected this. So nearly 15 million nfts minted, 2 million wallets. Over 3 billion in primary and secondary sales.
00:08:27.252 - 00:09:04.778, Speaker B: This is insane. The craziest number is the 100,000 estimated creators and builders for nfts. That's real people that build these projects and launch them. And they're able to do that because they figured out the complexity of all these tools. They figured out cryptography and they're able to go build these projects and build these new communities, build these new ip brands. I honestly believe that the next Disney, the next marvel, all the big stories that are going to be told 1020 years from now are going to come from NFT projects. If you're thinking about that as your dream, this is the best place to start.
00:09:04.778 - 00:09:41.724, Speaker B: The best place to start working on it. We hear stories of just awesome creators. This 14 year old girl from high school made this belugi's NFT set. It sold out, minted for over, I think, a million dollars. It raised in 24 hours for the Belugi conservation in Alaska. This was life changing for that girl and life changing for that nonprofit. And this was, you know, like one artist out of this 100,000.
00:09:41.724 - 00:10:37.524, Speaker B: The D gen trash banned us. They formed a dao and used the funds to build the plastic sculpture that was outside of Miami, outside of a lot of our hacker houses. And in Nairobi, the UN delegation used it for a ban on single use plastics. So this stuff, these are the stories that are being told. These are the stories that are being created as part of this web3 experience. But most of it is happening on desktop. I see pictures on Instagram of people on dates pulling out their laptops from their backpack just to go get into an NFT mint, or having to get up in the middle of family dinner to run to their computer because they don't want to miss that mint.
00:10:37.524 - 00:11:11.586, Speaker B: And that's sad, especially to me. I literally started my career at Qualcomm. I was there for over a decade. I worked on every mobile device under the sun. And I worked on this platform called Brew. I don't know if you folks remember it, this was one of the first developer platforms for mobile. This is at the time when the only thing people did with their phones was call and use ringtones.
00:11:11.586 - 00:11:48.604, Speaker B: And we built the first platform. We had a ton of developers actually building applications. And I remember the first breakout app, this was a huge deal, was Jamdat bowling. It had 2 million downloads, which was wild. It meant that 2 million people downloaded this kind of silly gaming app and were playing it while they were commuting or whatever. And we could see that our dream of having a computer in your hand that can do anything is possible. And little did we know that in three years, there is going to be nearly a billion people with that dream actualized.
00:11:48.604 - 00:12:37.034, Speaker B: It's crazy, right, how fast it can happen. So that can happen in crypto. I don't know if that three year period starts now. I think it might. So I think it's time for crypto to go mobile. So everyone that's been following us on Twitter, I think it's time to learn what is SMS? Introducing the Solana mobile stack. And I'm going to be joined by Steve Laver, who's going to tell you all about it on stage.
00:12:46.494 - 00:13:24.250, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. I'm Steven Laver and I am the mobile engineering lead at Solana Labs. So I've spent of my 20 year career most of that working on mobile devices, particularly on smartphones. Mobile devices are the center of our lives for everything, except somehow web3 still kind of feels like it's in the year 2007. My goal is to help bring world class Solana applications onto mobile devices. With that in mind, I'm pleased to be announcing the Solana mobile stack, or SMS. It's a web3 layer for Solana, built on Android.
00:13:24.250 - 00:14:08.204, Speaker D: That allows developers to build those mobile applications and bring them those experiences they want to bring to the community. It'll unlock our developer community to treat SMS devices as first class citizens of Solana. There's three technologies I want to announce today. The first, seed vault, a key custody solution. Second, mobile wallet adapter to bring transaction signing for DapPs to Android. Third, Solana pay for Android, bringing some of those mobile payment innovations like tap two pay to mobile devices with Solanapay. First, the seed vault.
00:14:08.204 - 00:15:01.494, Speaker D: There's a pretty wide gap in terms of user experience between software wallets. You have them running on your phone, great user experience, but they can't offer the same level of security as a dedicated hardware wallet can. Whereas a dedicated hardware wallet, very secure, but just not usable enough. And so our solution to this is the seed vault. With the seed vault, your Solana private keys and your seeds are stored securely protected by a dedicated hardware security module called a secure element that's commonly found in mobile devices. Your keys and seeds are only used in a highly secure execution environment and only to sign transactions. And what does this mean? It means that your keys are never shared with the Android OS or with Solana applications running on the phone to help keep your crypto safe.
00:15:01.494 - 00:15:35.344, Speaker D: So here's a diagram showing the seed vault. Starting in the lower right, we have that secure element, that hardware security module that's commonly found in mobile devices. From there, your keys and seeds move into a secure execution environment. For example, ARm trust zone, where we do the key processing and do signing. And then at the highest layer, we have Android UI, which provides that rich software wallet like experience for doing your signing. Altogether. This will bring easy transaction signing to Dapps on these Solana mobile devices.
00:15:35.344 - 00:16:11.774, Speaker D: This will be transformative for Solana on mobile. It's a highly usable and secure key custody, which will be a foundational technology for developers building on SMS. So the second thing I want to talk about is the mobile wallet adapter. On Solana. The web wallet adapter has been a key piece of infrastructure for signing transactions with from your dapps with wallets. It's the method by which a Dapp can ask a wallet to sign using the user's keys on their behalf. Mobile devices have the same a technology to connect dapps and wallets.
00:16:11.774 - 00:16:27.474, Speaker D: We're releasing an open source protocol mobile wallet adapter. It's an analog of wallet adapter, but brought to mobile devices. It will allow wallets to sign transactions from dapps using those users keys. In conjunction with the seed vault.
00:16:29.534 - 00:16:29.870, Speaker B: These.
00:16:29.902 - 00:17:18.242, Speaker D: Apps can be running anywhere, they can be native apps on the device. Whether they're native or react native, they can be web based apps running in the mobile Chrome web browser or even remotely on a nearby desktop or laptop. We're releasing a reference implementation of the protocol for Android. And just personally for me as an engineer, this one, I'm really excited about the idea that I can put my seeds and my keys on my phone, carry them everywhere, use them securely on either this device or alternatively on a nearby desktop or laptop. I think that's really going to open up the web3 ecosystem for mobile quick video showing how this might work. We can see here you want to purchase an NFT straight over to the wallet. As soon as you click approve, we bring up seed vault to authorize.
00:17:18.242 - 00:18:17.428, Speaker D: Tap your fingerprint on the sensor and there you go, it's in your wallet. A huge amount of engineering work went in behind the scenes to make this happen. There's a complex protocol that Dapps use to discover wallets available on the device. Connect to those wallets, establish an encrypted channel, and there's security baked into the protocol throughout. And this required cooperation. The between the Solana mobile stack and then wallets and dapps. One more thing I want to announce is the Solana Dappstore, an open Dapp store without the extractive fees, allowing for proliferation of crypto native apps, digital services, and digital goods like tokens, dapps don't always fit well into the existing App Store ecosystems.
00:18:17.428 - 00:19:15.226, Speaker D: So we built the Solana Dappstore from the ground up to be the best place to find Solana wallets, Solana Dapps, and more, all without the App Store fees and in line with the open ethos of crypto. Our eventual goal here is to empower the Solana community to participate in the moderation of the Dappstore catalog and just a sneak peek at some renders of what the Dappstore will look like. We're excited to bring this Dapp store to builders on SMS. And the best part, the software development kit for the Solana mobile stack is available now. It has libraries and documentation for developers everything that has been created on a desktop. I'm so amazed at the creativity and innovation of the ecosystem. The community is full of ideas and I'm excited for them to get their hands on this SDK so they can start building for the Solana mobile stack.
00:19:15.226 - 00:19:29.774, Speaker D: Solanomobile.com please go check it out and download it. That's all for the Solano mobile stack. And with that, I'll hand it back to Anatoly.
00:19:36.724 - 00:20:07.464, Speaker B: Thank you, Steven. So, wow. Right? Solana mobile Stack. Four new technologies for mobile the seed vault, which turns your phone into a hardware wallet. The mobile wallet adapter, which integrates all the dapps and wallets on your phone. Solana pay pay with any token anywhere, and the world's first open Dapp store without any extractive fees for developers. So as long as a secure hardware element is included, any oem can implement SMS on Android.
00:20:07.464 - 00:21:05.692, Speaker B: We're in conversations with major oems and carriers, but you don't have to wait. Introducing Saga, a flagship Android phone running the Solana mobile stack. And it's here, right here in my hand. It has all the Google services you expect. A bunch of privacy features, obviously. Solana Mobile Stack Seed Vault Mobile adapter Solana Pay world's first open Dapp store secure element of course, this device is built by a legendary team. Awesome.
00:21:05.692 - 00:21:32.184, Speaker B: It's led by Jason Keats, the architect of the iPad pro. It's a beautiful device machine, precision steel finish. It's awesome to hold in your hand. I'm just delighted to have it. It's got ridiculous stats. I think this thing could run a Solana validator. Amazing.
00:21:32.184 - 00:21:54.224, Speaker B: Beautiful screen, 6.67 inches, 512gb of storage, twelve gigs of ram. The latest Qualcomm chip. This is the latest one they just released. Integrated secure element. And there's more, of course, nfts. So the Saga Pass is a community passport for SMS.
00:21:54.224 - 00:22:28.944, Speaker B: The long term vision for this is for the early adopters and developers to govern and influence the direction of the platform. So join a community of early users and get access to special experiences, games and benefits so available for the first time to early adopters. So we want to take care of our community. This is a flagship device. This device, if it was built by anyone else, would be sold for $1,300. But we want to take care of you guys. We want to give you the best possible Android device on the market and like in Solana's fashion, cheapest and fastest.
00:22:28.944 - 00:23:18.824, Speaker B: So go to solanamobile.com, comma, pre order it. It's shipping in Q 120 23 and developer devices will be available before Lisbon. Thank you guys so much. So I'd love to get Sam Bankman fried on stage here to talk to me about FTX, crypto and mobile.
00:23:39.964 - 00:23:41.516, Speaker E: It's super cool.
00:23:41.660 - 00:23:44.308, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, thank you for being here.
00:23:44.396 - 00:23:45.224, Speaker E: Of course.
00:23:45.844 - 00:23:48.092, Speaker B: So what's latest with FTX?
00:23:48.268 - 00:24:22.114, Speaker E: I mean, a lot. It's been a busy month, but no, the biggest things remain regulatory. I spending probably a third of my time in DC, and I think the thing I'm most optimistic about is that it seems like in about a six month period, we may go from no regulatory frameworks in the United States to fairly reasonable ones that hopefully will help give clarity, help allow the ecosystem to grow in the country, give customer protection, and allow institutions to feel comfortable getting involved.
00:24:22.894 - 00:24:44.702, Speaker B: That's awesome. I mean, I remember in the nineties, the MCA, right, that was like Congress had to pass something to get Internet companies and everyone else worked well together and all the explosion and growth happened right after. So super excited about that. So you've often talked about FTX as being the exchange of everything. What does that mean?
00:24:44.878 - 00:25:40.888, Speaker E: Yeah, so there are a few sides to it, and maybe one of them, when you look in the vertical direction, is it's a full stack product. So it goes from the back end matching engine, custody clearing settlement risk engine, to the front end mobile app, website API. What that allows us to do is offer direct, equitable access to everyone, rather than saying, unless you're like an HFT firm, you can't get direct exchange access. Of course that serves as the crypto standard. And I think it's one of the most compelling things about crypto market structure is that it actually does implement much more equitable access than what you see. The other thing I think in the horizontal direction is that we want to be able to give as comprehensive of financial experiences as possible. And on the back end you can look internationally where we have tokenized stocks, addition to cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies and prediction markets.
00:25:40.888 - 00:26:28.584, Speaker E: On the platform in the US, we'll be launching stocks on FTX in the next couple months. And I know, right, that'll be not exactly revolutionary, but what it is working towards is trying to have a platform where everything you want to do, you can do. And I think that's been a big missing thing from the US fintech ecosystem in general, is a platform where you can have a card, direct deposits, crypto investing, stock investing, peer to peer payments, and where you can do all that with blockchain rail. So it's super interoperable with everything in crypto, super easy to send payments to anyone. So that's been sort of another long term goal that we're probably two thirds of the way through.
00:26:28.964 - 00:26:37.472, Speaker B: That's awesome. So what are you excited about? Like web3 and mobile, given your vision for being the financial services for everything?
00:26:37.588 - 00:27:13.652, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, everything is going to mobile. I mean, the United States is maybe one of the few places where that's less true. But in most countries, most of the access happens through mobile phones. And the mobile financial access in a lot of places, including the United States, is pretty bad right now. I mean, this is just across the board true. Your bank probably doesn't really work on mobile. If it works anywhere, you can't access traditional financial exchanges, but also you can't really use web3 wallets right now on mobile.
00:27:13.652 - 00:28:07.296, Speaker E: If you want to go try and trade on uniswap on your phone, it's a mess. I think one thing which is super exciting is the best solution to this is having your actual wallet built hardware into your phone set. Your phone is natively like, you don't need to have any other sort of like interplay between two different tabs in your wallet and to be able to just natively access web3 from your phone. And that's true for using on chain whatever NFT platforms. Dexs, it's true for sending money to and from crypto exchanges too, right? Just like one tap to send it in and out of crypto exchange with your hardware wallet. And I think it's a big step. And obviously peer to peer payments, there's nothing more purely peer to peer than literally my hardware to your hardware happening seamlessly and instantly.
00:28:07.296 - 00:28:09.924, Speaker E: And so I think it's a huge step forward.
00:28:10.224 - 00:28:27.540, Speaker B: So what I mean, that's awesome. What gives me a visceral belief that crypto is money is if I can pay for coffee with it. And this is like one of the key features that I'm really excited about, saga, is that we can integrate the NFC tap to pay directly with token payments.
00:28:27.612 - 00:28:28.220, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:28:28.372 - 00:28:32.460, Speaker B: So how are you guys thinking about payments? And how's that exciting for FTX?
00:28:32.532 - 00:28:50.108, Speaker E: Yeah, totally. I totally agree. Like that is the key is when you actually want to pay for something, you can do it with crypto, right? Not just like in theory, crypto could move, but like when you actually go to buy something. Because right now I don't use. I try to, but I never can. Right. It's like 1% of my purchases can be with crypto.
00:28:50.108 - 00:29:27.694, Speaker E: I would way prefer. And when we acquire a company, frankly, we ask if we can pay with stable coins. I mean, it's a lot easier in wire transfer, but when I get a donut, it's hopeless. And so there's one step of this is literally just having web3 enabled devices. And I think like a hardware wallet built into a phone with software natively running on it to facilitate payments is super powerful. The part of it that we're working on with FTXpay. And that we super excited to partner with you guys on here as well, and see what the right way is to stack these together is basically effectively converting between fiat and cryptocurrencies.
00:29:27.694 - 00:29:58.054, Speaker E: And so traditionally, we look at FTX as like, it's an exchange and there's a sort of auxiliary wallet. But if you flip that around and say, well, it's a wallet, and you can convert on it, right, then it's a way where you can just use, as a payment processor, send in SPL, USDC, send out dollars or whatever you want. And I think the main goal is being the connector port between a point of service that wants dollars and a payer that wants to pay in crypto or vice versa.
00:29:59.274 - 00:30:19.422, Speaker B: Exactly. But the problem that you guys are solving, which we can't, is those rails between crypto and the real financial world. So, I mean, I'm really excited to partner with you guys on this because there's no way we can do this alone. So what's next for FTX?
00:30:19.558 - 00:30:46.952, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, we'll see that the world keeps changing. So will we. But obviously, one of the biggest things is trying to launch a first class crypto experience in the United States, which is something that has never been done. I certainly wouldn't say that we have done it yet, but we're trying. And regulation is the big blocker there. But I'm optimistic that over the next year, we're going to be able to get much more feature parity between what we have in the states and what we have globally. That's one of the things.
00:30:46.952 - 00:31:12.624, Speaker E: Second thing, continuing just to get licensed more and more jurisdictions. Building out payment rails, we now have instant bank transfers in Japan. We have regulated exchange there, and that's super exciting. And there's a bunch of different variants of that. Building out and then adding more and more consumer financial features to the app. Direct deposits, I think, are one of the things that's going to be coming next in the US to the app, along with stocks.
00:31:13.004 - 00:31:16.384, Speaker B: So you think I'll be able to pay my phone bill on FTX?
00:31:17.044 - 00:31:25.148, Speaker E: Well, sort of. You can get the FTX card, right, tied to your FTX account and then use that card number, and that sort of works.
00:31:25.236 - 00:31:29.084, Speaker B: Cool. That's awesome. Yeah. Well, thank you for being.
00:31:29.124 - 00:31:29.572, Speaker E: Of course.
00:31:29.668 - 00:31:36.508, Speaker B: Yeah. All right.
00:31:36.636 - 00:31:38.308, Speaker E: Thank you and congratulations.
00:31:38.356 - 00:31:51.464, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you, Sam. And I'm going to hand this off to Austin, who's going to show you guys all the builders and partners building on Solana mobile Stack, Austin.
00:31:58.364 - 00:32:47.804, Speaker A: Thanks, Anatolian Sam, for that. So you've heard about four new technologies we're bringing to mobile today. The Solana mobile stack, which includes seed vault, turning your device into a hardware wallet that can securely manage your keys the mobile wallet adapter, which allows both web apps and dapps built on the Solana mobile stack to communicate with any wallet on your phone and interface with the seed phrases stored in the seed vault. And Solana pay for Android, which enables new kinds of payments, whether that's token payments, tap to pay for Solana Pay, and lots of new features that we'll be talking about more later this year. And the world's first open Dapp store without extractive fees for developers. So it's now time to talk to some of the builders who are actually already integrating this technology into both their Dapps, their web applications and new things they're building on Solana. So first up, you're going to hear from Magic Eden.
00:32:58.284 - 00:33:25.488, Speaker C: Hi everyone, my name is Jack Lu. I'm the CEO and co founder of Magic Eden. Super great to be here today. I'm very excited to partner with Solana on SMS. So, Magic Eden, we're the leading NFT marketplace on Solana and we're also one of the largest decentralized apps globally across all the chains. So we started nine months ago and today we serve over 20 million. We served over 20 million unique user sessions per month.
00:33:25.488 - 00:33:49.784, Speaker C: And each user session on average is around 14 minutes. So where. So we have more engagement than a lot of the web, two marketplaces, as well as some social media applications. Earlier this week, we were also very proud to announce our Series B fundraise. We raised $130 million at 1.6 billion valuations. Thank you.
00:33:49.784 - 00:34:43.404, Speaker C: So while we've been super thankful for the traction we've had so far, that traction today has been primarily built on top of a desktop experience. So for context, a couple of months ago in November, we did launch a mobile app and we launched that primarily as an experiment to understand user behavior on different platforms. And we saw just insane demand for our magic Eden users for a full fledged, polished mobile experience. So we did very little marketing on mobile app, we got 200,000 downloads. And then outside of the mobile app, we found that 50% of our traffic today comes from mobile browsers. And on those mobile browsers, the users tend to convert like 30% more frequently than users on Chrome on desktop. So there is just a lot of pent up demand for our users for something that's on the go, easy and crisp in terms of mobile experience.
00:34:43.404 - 00:35:21.634, Speaker C: Unfortunately, our mobile app experience today is really limited. We don't even have some very, very basic functionality like trading, minting. And these are the core use cases that an NFT user would like to experience. And the reason we don't have that functionality is because of today's App Store restrictions around digital asset purchases. So we've been always searching for the perfect solve to have a breakthrough mobile experience for our users. And if you sit back and think about it, NFTs are inherently a social experience. It's a way for users to connect to each other and for users to express themselves.
00:35:21.634 - 00:36:01.864, Speaker C: And we think mobile is the perfect modality and the perfect platform to explore that expression. It allows many, many more innovative and much more flexible ways for users to connect to each other. And for us, it's magic Eden as a platform to also connect to our users. And we want to bring those new use cases and explorations to life so that we can grow the NFT ecosystems over the long term. So that's why we're here today and that's why we're so excited to partner with Solana on the Solana mobile stack. At Magic Eden, we've always prided ourselves on being innovators. We want to be the first to experiment with new things and explore new use cases.
00:36:01.864 - 00:36:53.190, Speaker C: So we were the first to have immersive gaming within the Magic eater marketplace itself, where users can play the game. We were the first to have Launchpad, a creator tool within the marketplace. And we really want to be one of the first launch partners to explore what's the future of a web3 mobile platform. So our goal in this partnership is to deliver a full fledged, full lifecycle mobile experience that's at parity with desktop and over time also explore new unique use cases that only mobile can serve for our user. So I'm very excited today to also kind of show you a few illustrative marks of some of the experiences that we want to explore on SMS. And of course, these things will change as we get our hands dirty with the developer toolkit. So the use case I want to talk about today is minting.
00:36:53.190 - 00:37:21.624, Speaker C: So in the NFT world, minting is one of the most important moments for a user. It's a thrilling and exciting moment because collectors, they wait months for the creator to drop their nfTs. The main thing is when the collector purchases the NFT from the creator for the first time. So they've been waiting months. It's a moment of anticipation. It's like getting a, you know, you've lined up for hours for that, like really hard to get concert ticket or that really rare sneaker job. Right.
00:37:21.624 - 00:38:04.738, Speaker C: So it's highly emotive and users want something really fast, really crisp and really seamless to get their hands on this NFT that they've been waiting for. And today on desktop, they have to whip out their laptop. They're not on the go. It's very inconvenient. But as you can see here on mobile with SMS, we could have this really seamless notification wallet connection and then a minting experience that drops securely into your wallet. So we're really excited to deliver these use cases and serve our user needs. Yeah, so that's it for me and yeah, very, very excited to partner with Solana on the next frontier for mobile in crypto.
00:38:04.826 - 00:38:05.454, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:38:26.534 - 00:39:45.094, Speaker F: Hey everyone, my name is Brandon Millman. I'm the CEO and co founder of Fanta and today I'm super excited to talk about Saga, the Solana mobile stack, and why these technologies are a major breakthrough for mainstream adoption of web3 technologies. But first, what is Fantom? So Phantom is the leading wallet for the Solana ecosystem and one of the biggest applications in web3. With over 3 million users across desktop, iOS and Android, Phantom is your gateway to a world of web3 applications and serves as your identity in this new digital economy. By focusing on industry leading user interaction and design, Phantom creates an inviting and familiar experience for users, making them much more likely to stick around and continue exploring the web3 ecosystem. We first launched the first Phantom mobile applications just five months ago, and since then, the mobile user base has grown to 35% of our total active users, with the majority of those active users actually joining in the most recent months, there are actually 5.1 million transactions made using Phantom mobile applications in the month of May alone.
00:39:45.094 - 00:40:36.186, Speaker F: With the advent of fast and cheap transactions that Solana enables, we believe the path to onboarding a billion users to web3 goes through mobile. But for web3 to succeed on mobile, it needs an ecosystem. The Solana mobile stack and the applications that are built on top of it is the start of that ecosystem. The wallet is the cornerstone of the web3 experience and we're excited to be updating our mobile applications to support the Solana mobile stack. In the coming months, our Android app will be updated to support key features being announced today. We'll be supporting the mobile wallet adapter so that you can sign transactions from the Phantom Android app for your favorite mobile and web dapps. For saga users, we'll enable secure key management via the seed vault.
00:40:36.186 - 00:41:03.634, Speaker F: Fantom wants our users to have the safest user experience possible. And the seed vault will give saga users an even safer way to store and sign their transactions. We're excited to be part of this big step forward in the mobile space and to continue to support the growing ecosystem. You'll see more about what the new Phantom experience on mobile looks like very soon. Thank you.
00:41:17.614 - 00:41:19.302, Speaker G: Hi, everyone, I'm Ori.
00:41:19.398 - 00:41:20.318, Speaker F: And I'm Etaro.
00:41:20.406 - 00:42:07.770, Speaker G: And we are the co founders of Orca, the leading amm on Solana and the trading experience you love to love. You may have heard of us from our catchphrase, Defi for people, not programs. I love this catchphrase because a capture is what we're all about, bringing the benefits of Defi to everyday people. But if we think about where everyday people are, they're on their phones, right? I'm thinking of people like my dad. He's retired, he's got a lot of time on his hands, and he would love nothing more than to spend that time Degen trading on orca. Right, right. Your dad probably too, right? But it's just so hard, you know, if I thought about trying to teach him to do this, and it's like, fire up a laptop, you plug in a ledger, you put a browser extension.
00:42:07.770 - 00:42:52.370, Speaker G: I don't want to explain what a browser extension is to my dad. And so, like, okay, this is just not going to happen, right? Like, I'm just going to go back to building orca. But fast forward to where we are now. We have the Solana mobile stack, and finally we can realize these experiences, these radically simple user experiences that will bring the benefits of Defi to a new generation of users. Let's see what that might look like, shall we? So in this little demo, as the markets move in real time, you can be out there, get a little notification on your phone, go ahead, authenticate with your finger. And just like that, with a single touch, your trade's executed. You're on your way back to whatever it is you were doing before.
00:42:52.370 - 00:43:07.174, Speaker G: Simple, right? But radically simple. Thank you. Thank you. Love the claps, man. All right, so this is the Defi trading of tomorrow.
00:43:07.554 - 00:43:52.470, Speaker F: Yeah. And so at Arca, we understand that there's going to be this mass migration of users from the desktop experience to the mobile experience. So we're committed to taking our existing responsive UI and turning that into a mobile first experience. And we're going to start with the saga phone, and we're going to start with the Solana mobile stack. On top of that, we're going to. So we're also going to can't commit to anything. However, we do understand that with this migration, there's going to be new user behavior, emergent user behavior, and we've been thinking about that, and we've been thinking about a new mobile experience that's powered by the liquidity layer of orca.
00:43:52.470 - 00:43:59.062, Speaker F: And that's something that we're definitely going to explore with Sagafone. So we're incredibly excited about that, too.
00:43:59.158 - 00:44:00.394, Speaker G: Between you and us.
00:44:00.854 - 00:44:34.490, Speaker F: Yeah. One other thing. I'm going to talk a little bit about the SDK as a developer. One thing that I love about it is that if you're already familiar with the typescript Solanaweb3 JS SDK, then it's going to be very familiar. You still get to connect to an RPC server, you can still fetch accounts from the blockchain. In a similar way, you can construct transactions, send transactions, et cetera. So it's going to be a fairly seamless experience to transition to supporting the Solana mobile stack.
00:44:34.490 - 00:45:06.844, Speaker F: There's also going to be a Kotlin SDK for anyone that wants to create a native experience using the Android platform that you're familiar with. And finally, one of the plans is to create a react native SDK. And so that'll allow developers to support the full spectrum of options, whether it be the web application, a react native application, or a fully native application for Android. So I'm really excited about that.
00:45:07.004 - 00:45:12.704, Speaker G: If you're a little bit less big brain than Utaro, all he's really saying is that building on mobile is going to be super easy.
00:45:14.284 - 00:45:33.964, Speaker F: Yeah. And one other thing is, if you are a developer, if you're a developer and you're interested in a mobile experience built on top of our whirlpools program, we have a builders program. So please come to us with any of your ideas and we'd love to support you.
00:45:34.544 - 00:46:10.624, Speaker G: Build on orca, maybe get money. Fun. But long story short, the north Star of Orca has always been to bring these financial opportunities of crypto to as many people as possible. We see this as a first step in that saga, and we're really honored to be a part of it, building alongside the Solana ecosystem as a whole to ensure that the experiences that result are truly human centered. Thanks for having us all. It's been a splash.
00:46:21.784 - 00:46:22.120, Speaker B: Wow.
00:46:22.152 - 00:46:51.304, Speaker F: This is insane. Yeah. Hey, everyone, my name is Armani Ferrante, and I am one of the co founders of Coral. So at Coral, we are a big part of the Solana developer ecosystem, and I'm super excited about the potential that the Solana mobile stack and saga has to improve the developer experience. And this is something that we are pretty intimately familiar with. So we're the creators of Anchor. Anchor is everyone's favorite toolkit for building smart contracts on Solana.
00:46:51.304 - 00:47:38.164, Speaker F: But today, I'm not here to talk about anchor. I'm here to talk about something else. So we're building a new product, a next generation crypto wallet that we call backpack. So, unlike anything else, backpack is built for one thing and one thing only, a new protocol that we're developing that we like to call xnFts. So today, NFTs are these amazing profile pictures that we all love and adore. They represent these incredible communities of people around the world, but honestly, they're a bit static, and there's no real reason why they have to be that way. Nfts should be rich, they should be dynamic, they should be living and breathing representations of the communities they're supposed to reflect.
00:47:38.164 - 00:48:04.804, Speaker F: In fact, they should have all of the capabilities of a program. And this is exactly what we're doing with xnfts. So x stands for executable. This is an entirely new way to build applications for a crypto wallet. Like other crypto assets, you can buy your xnfts and you can sell them. But unlike anything else, xnfts turn the wallet into an open, programmable platform for anyone to build on. And I'm excited to show you what we've done.
00:48:04.804 - 00:48:43.044, Speaker F: So this is backpack. If you take a look at the image here, you'll see but your icons, but everything here is a token. So on the left, we have this beautiful Aurorian, and surrounding it, we have all these application icons. But whether it's an NFT or whether it's an application, in backpack, they're one and the same. Everything is an xnft. And so what I'm about to show you is going to be a video. But the one takeaway I want you to have when watching this video is that when you see backpack, not only will you see your tokens, and not only will you see your nfts, but in fact, for the first time, you'll see all of your crypto assets, every protocol, on every blockchain, inside of a single user interface.
00:48:43.044 - 00:49:43.524, Speaker F: So, yeah, that's backpack, I'm excited to say. At the end of the summer, backpack will be available for download. And we're super excited to be part of the launch partners with Saga. We think that the combination of Saga, the Solana mobile stack, and XNFTs will allow web3 developers to make brand new experiences that have never been seen before. And we can't wait to see what you build. Thanks for listening.
00:50:07.644 - 00:50:45.764, Speaker H: Hi, I'm Kais, co founder of OK bears. Since our launch seven weeks ago, OK Bears has been breaking records and making history. What started as a clean, inclusive NFT collection quickly became one of Space's most impactful digital brands. Through OK Bears, we will channel our platform, art and community to instill hope where it is needed most. But today, I'm here to speak about the people behind the brand, the OK bears community. Together, we inspire optimism through online activity. Every single day, we spread the message that you're enough just the way you are.
00:50:45.764 - 00:51:28.414, Speaker H: And it is totally ok to be ok. Because often in good times, we share joy together. But when the chips are down, we tend to struggle alone. So before a single bear was minted, our community took to Twitter to tell the world that we're all going to be ok. Thousands of people from over 100 countries walked outside to take a breath of fresh air and tweet one unified message. Now, one tweet that I'm never going to forget is from a father from the Philippines who wrote, Life is full of struggles, but my child is my inspiration to keep me going and fight and keep moving forward. Father and daughter, we are ok.
00:51:28.414 - 00:52:33.804, Speaker H: The building our brand on Solana meant that our digital products were inclusive and accessible to everyone around the world, regardless of their spending, power or location. Which is why after a history making launch, our community continued to grow as original holders found life changing exit points. Now, sometimes we get lost in the tech, but everyone here in the audience today has been making and building things that make those messages on screen possible. By contributing to the Solana ecosystem. By building tools that make it possible for someone to escape poverty, to take a well earned break after years of hustle to secure their future at just 17 years old, or, as my friend perks puts it, just simply become a better person. Now at OK Bears, we set the standard for a community centric brand by taking the time to know our community. As it grows, we see that Justin has been making charts about OK bears every single day.
00:52:33.804 - 00:53:30.342, Speaker H: And when the bear market got tough, JP and slick started hash OKdrip, giving the community an outlet to express themselves through fashion during what was a really difficult time. Nate takes to every Twitter space to spread Wagbo vibes, and chef continues to send his heartwarming ramen noodles all across his country. So, inspired by our community's conviction, our team creates art to thank them for supporting each other. Because when bears build, we build together. But today, we're ready for our message to transcend the Internet into the real world. Which is why I'm delighted to announce the launch of our OK Bears shop, the first Solana token gated e commerce experience in collaboration with iconic and powered by Shopify. Just a quick mention to the iconic team who's in the crowd today.
00:53:30.342 - 00:54:14.054, Speaker H: Thank you, guys. Now, this is nuts. Iconic is one of the leading digital art brands in the world, with inspirational artwork displayed in hundreds of thousands of homes and office spaces. And somehow, our OK bears message feels at home next to iconic collabs like giants like Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan, and absolutely incredible brands like Monopoly Peanuts and many, many more. Now, that's not the only thing we're launching today. We're also launching our first set of OK Bears products, including a cozy hibernation blanket for winter and a beach towel ready for Solana Summer. Now let's take a quick tour through the shop and listen to some lo fi beats in the process.
00:54:14.054 - 00:55:55.974, Speaker H: So we've worked with iconic and Shopify to create a beautiful token gated experience for our community and beyond. And now, with the launch of Saga, our team cannot wait to implement some of our upcoming digital products utilizing the Solana mobile stack. But with all the incredible things being revealed here today, I have a good feeling that we're all going to be okay. Thank you.
00:56:29.924 - 00:56:34.932, Speaker B: Should I go? All right, guys. So, hello, everyone.
00:56:34.988 - 00:56:37.188, Speaker F: My name is Ervin, and this is my co founder, Shawn.
00:56:37.276 - 00:56:38.184, Speaker B: Hey, guys.
00:56:39.924 - 00:57:23.974, Speaker F: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. And I think it's an honor actually to be here, standing on the same stage as the same products and the teams that are building or redefining the Solana ecosystem as we know it through the use of the Solana mobile stack in general. And over the past hour, really what we've come to learn is really about a paradigm shift. A shift in the way that we develop native web, three mobile applications and the way that we interact with them. It's fundamentally different. And it comes down to really not only just the way the applications, but also how we experience them overall.
00:57:23.974 - 00:58:14.624, Speaker F: And when you think about it, it comes down to three main points. The first one is security, the ability to have key management that provides hard guarantees, that have hard guarantees by the hardware. The second one is really interoperability, the ability for silo applications or ecosystems to interact or communicate with each other under one cohesive development stack. We don't have that currently in blockchain, as you can know. And I think the third one is really more important is mobile accessibility, the ability to interact with the blockchain or interact with the blockchain on the go. That means actually touching grasp because everything will be mobile. But fundamentally, really to achieve this, what we need is an all in one solution that provides a seamless user experience.
00:58:14.624 - 00:59:02.074, Speaker F: An experience that actually abstracts the transactional part of dealing with the blockchain or interfacing with smart contracts, as you guys probably experienced in this context. T ome is a solution for that, that all in one solution. Kiome is a place where you can interact and transact with all your digital assets in a seamless user experience. Kiyomi is a place where you can create interactive and engaging experiences with your nfts. Kiyomi is a place where you can actually connect with communities through the concept of the mini apps. Because when you look at nfts and communities such as the ok bears, they both have their own cultures, they all have their own necessities. So they want to, they want to employ and deploy, and Kiomi really allows you to do all these things in one.
00:59:02.074 - 00:59:32.844, Speaker F: But most importantly, Kiomi is a way to securely store your digital assets and bring them to life. And that is why we're committed to actually integrating the Solana mobile stack into the versions of Kiyomi that are on Android, iOS, and perhaps smart TVs. So what we're going to show you today is really a walkthrough of what Kiyomi provides and what you can do within a lite version of Kiyomi.
00:59:56.164 - 00:59:57.464, Speaker B: All right, there we go.
00:59:57.964 - 01:00:33.224, Speaker F: All right, so this is for this purpose. This is actually a fully working Android version of Kia me. We have a version iOS and Android, and hopefully pretty soon on Saga that leverages the Solana mobile stack. And so Kiyomi lite is really built so you can chill and chill with your nfts. Because fundamentally, if you came to NftNYC, you didn't come just to shill Solana, you came to shill your nfts. And for those NFT bros or broettes in the crowd, you can think about the experience of actually shilling your nfts. What do people usually do? Either take a screenshot and you go ahead and shove it in someone's face.
01:00:33.224 - 01:01:24.132, Speaker F: Or maybe if you're silly enough, you have your hot wallet filled with ten ok bears and you just walk around with it, and he still shoved it in someone's face. So then what is the next generation experience? How can we engage communities? How can we create content that inspires, that turns everyone into a collector, a creator, a curator. That is the question. And so Kiyomi provides you this answer where you can, instead of actually shoving your jpegs in someone's face, you can go ahead and display a multitude of nfts. And instead of actually just shoving someone in their face, you can create a world and an experience around them that they can consume. Kiyomi is a different way to consume the media, not just create it. So in this context, if you guys have actually followed our game, which is called openera, then you might have gotten a few things, like an airdrop.
01:01:24.132 - 01:01:31.628, Speaker F: I won't show you any alpha, but besides that, if you're a fan, you can go ahead and create multiple content. I think the sound is not working.
01:01:31.756 - 01:01:33.346, Speaker B: If you guys could help us with that.
01:01:33.540 - 01:02:02.854, Speaker F: There you go. So then essentially with this kind of application, you can go ahead and turn, like, again, a creator, a collector, a curator, and create content that is only engaging, but then inspires people besides it. Share on Twitter. And so, of course we have to go ahead and share it to our socials.
01:02:07.354 - 01:02:08.242, Speaker B: Let's do it.
01:02:08.338 - 01:02:25.938, Speaker F: Servitude in life. All right. So really, to do this right, when you think about the way that wallets or mobile are currently cryptocurrency modifications, they're usually just literally react js or HTML five applications wrapped on a native casing.
01:02:26.066 - 01:02:26.842, Speaker B: But when we look at the things.
01:02:26.858 - 01:03:18.194, Speaker F: That we're doing, we're doing augmented reality without the need for a lighter. And this involves, this involves our research in computer vision and also image processing around different objects and locations, something that is done natively on the phone and could be created through Kiyomi. Thank you. But so the last part, as I mentioned, is that when you think about what it's like to perhaps hold, ok, bears or djing trash pandas, you want to create unique content and share with people. A lot of times what I do. Ok, so probably is the question you guys have seen, what if people do at clubs, they probably want to show them like this. What if instead you could just pull up your nfts and show it to someone and share that experience? These are things that we could do with Kiyomi in reality.
01:03:18.194 - 01:03:54.094, Speaker F: But beyond that, Kiaomi also employs a concept with the mini app so that communities can develop mini apps for particular collections. And this is through an open source SDK that we'll be launching pretty soon. And here's an example of one mini app that we've been working on alongside the Cupcake team in Jordan. Two demo. So if you guys are familiar with cupcake, and you've seen cupcakes around. Cupcakes are a way to actually mint an NFT without the loose of a wallet. It's a non custodial weight, and you can essentially embed the minting process on a chip that could be placed anywhere across the world.
01:03:54.094 - 01:04:32.574, Speaker F: Now, this seems pretty fun and pretty simple, but what else can we do natively? Think about Pokemon Go, perhaps a Pokemon go application that connects directly to your wallet. Think about treasure hunts. Think about maybe the future. But with that said, I invite you guys to come test our test flight and also reach out to us to get access to our Android version that's currently in Alpha. And I'll end saying that Kiomi is more than just a wallet. It's a way to experience nfts and beyond. And it's currently coming to Solana and Saga through the use of Solana mobile stack.
01:04:32.574 - 01:04:34.294, Speaker F: Thank you very much.
01:04:53.244 - 01:05:24.454, Speaker A: All right, well, we've heard from a number of builders now who are excited to be developing on the Solana mobile stack and building on saga. These are just a few of the great projects that are already looking at this technology and committed to building and integrating it into their applications. This is, again, a small list of the folks who have already committed to integrating and building this tech. There's a lot of fan favorites out here. Really excited to see. There's actually a ton more that we couldn't fit on this slide. So make sure you check out the website.
01:05:24.454 - 01:06:10.500, Speaker A: There'll be a pretty regularly updated list of logos there. But these are some of the favorites we're looking at, from games to wallets to AR experiences like you saw. And what's really great about something like the mobile wallet adapter is you see someone like Orca is able to actually integrate a full experience as if it was an app running on the phone, but it connects through the browser, so it's a really easy load for developers to actually add this to their systems. And we're really excited to see what folks are going to be building. So in order to help people build, the Solana foundation is here to support people building on the network. And developers really are the life of the network. So there's a $10 million developer fund for developing on Solana mobile stack and Saga that is open now.
01:06:10.500 - 01:06:28.914, Speaker A: You can check that out@solanamobile.com. Dot well, you can also, it's going to be great. $10 million guys to build apps. It's great. So visit solanamobile.com dot. You can download the SDK which is available today.
01:06:28.914 - 01:06:56.954, Speaker A: You can apply to the developer fund, and you can also, of course, preorder the saga, which will start shipping in early. Q one. So thank you all for joining us today for the unveiling of the Solana mobile stack and saga. And before we end today, we'd like to bring up Anatoly, Raj, and Steven to answer some questions from press. There's two microphones on either side, so feel free to line up there.
01:07:11.704 - 01:07:13.964, Speaker I: All right, what do you guys think?
01:07:21.184 - 01:07:22.444, Speaker F: Excellent. Pretty cool.
01:07:23.324 - 01:07:24.584, Speaker B: Anybody coming up?
01:07:26.484 - 01:07:28.024, Speaker I: No lineup behind you.
01:07:29.004 - 01:07:42.148, Speaker B: You gotta start. All right, so. All right. Oh, hello. I'm Danny. I'm from Coindesk. So I'm interested in hearing more about the developer fund.
01:07:42.148 - 01:08:01.200, Speaker B: The $10 million has, like, we have all these commitments already where someone has all these commitments already from Magic Eden and the like. Has the fund started deploying yet to developers? Have you heard any interest or is this all been kept under wraps such that only now it's getting rolled out? Yeah.
01:08:01.232 - 01:09:00.578, Speaker I: There haven't been any grants or investments from the fund that contributed to any of the builders that you saw on stage that chose to build on SMS or saga. That fund is dedicated for mobile developers. But there's also other funds like you may have seen in the last two weeks. We announced $100 million fund focused on korean web, three companies, and specifically focused on games. And then when you saw the partner list that Austin showed of folks that couldn't be here, you probably noticed a bunch of games. So both with partners on gaming funds, we have two other funds with FTX and Forte and others, and just the independent investment community that's been pouring money into the salon ecosystem. We expect to see that there should be a good amount of funding for new teams, but we're making sure there's definitely $10 million right away for the small set of developer kit recipients that we expect to receive devices this year.
01:09:00.746 - 01:09:40.702, Speaker B: And Anatoly, I'd love to hear a little more about how your experiences at Qualcomm have shaped your. Yeah, I mean, the brew experience was pretty important in retrospect because at that time, nobody really believed in mobile. We couldn't convince Facebook to build a mobile app. The browser experience sucked, literally. Ringtones were the only non call thing that people used. But everyone believed that there's going to be some moment in the future where you have a supercomputer in your hand, and I think all of us believe crypto adoption. You're going to have your hardware wallet in your phone.
01:09:40.702 - 01:10:09.104, Speaker B: It's a device that you use every day. So that's going to happen. So this is something that I just fundamentally believe the industry needs to do. And we didn't see a single crypto feature at the Apple developer conference, 13 years after bitcoin has been live. So I think it's going to take us to do it. And from a historical perspective, this is actually before my time in crypto, but in, in 2018, Siran Labs had cryptophone. It didn't work out so well.
01:10:09.104 - 01:10:45.622, Speaker B: Now, I'm not saying that this is equivalent to that, but it is certainly the biggest, most high profile web3 phone since. How is this project going to kind of avoid, or attempt to avoid the pitfalls that. Yeah, I think what's different now than previous times is the number of developers entering the space. You know, you see folks leaving Facebook, leaving Google and start companies in web3. And to me it means that we're now at this precipice of adoption. It literally took three years. From Jamdap bowling to iPhone is like in half a billion people's hands.
01:10:45.622 - 01:11:00.348, Speaker B: I don't know when that three year timeline starts. I feel like it's going to. It already started, like just simply because of the number of amazing founders entering the space and the amount of funding that's pouring into it and Tess. Oh, wow.
01:11:00.396 - 01:11:00.612, Speaker F: Okay.
01:11:00.628 - 01:11:25.892, Speaker B: That's a big difference. It's the Osom phone, right, sorry, what? The phone itself. The hardware? Yep. How did you pick that company, that phone? It's really Jason. I don't know if you ever get a chance to meet with him, but he is just like one of these founders that is just so driven. He's a crazy hardware developer. He like Bill Champs, Cameron submarine door, just an amazing entrepreneur.
01:11:25.892 - 01:11:37.944, Speaker B: And we just mind melded, just immediately felt like this is like a relationship that we can get joined at the hip. I don't have any other questions at this point.
01:11:39.964 - 01:11:42.024, Speaker D: Can the text bubbles be purple?
01:11:43.524 - 01:11:51.258, Speaker B: You know, we can make them any color you want if we tried. Yeah.
01:11:51.266 - 01:11:55.498, Speaker A: If there are other questions from the audience, feel free to line up at the microphones and happy to take a.
01:11:55.506 - 01:11:56.134, Speaker F: Bunch.
01:12:05.914 - 01:12:08.374, Speaker A: Or maybe we just answered everyone's questions today.
01:12:09.434 - 01:12:10.294, Speaker B: Go ahead.
01:12:15.054 - 01:12:32.470, Speaker F: So with 21 million users or wallets right now to scale to a billion users, what is the approach or what are the considerations on the hardware side that you're thinking about for scale from the 2200 transactions per second to the.
01:12:32.502 - 01:12:35.654, Speaker B: Millions on the network itself?
01:12:35.774 - 01:12:36.590, Speaker F: Yeah. On the hardware.
01:12:36.622 - 01:13:02.364, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So that just takes a bunch of cores, like literally, if you had systems with 512 cores in them, it could do a lot more transactions. On paper, that looks like ten gigabits worth, which is millions. The software has to catch up to that. It has to be performant enough where the locks are efficient. It's moving the data, the pipelines through all the memory and PCI interfaces as fast as possible.
01:13:02.364 - 01:13:29.014, Speaker B: That's just, there's a major release every three months. Devs are grinding. That kind of systems work. It takes time, but it's all downhill. I think we'll get there as fast as humanly possible, and I think we'll get here as adoption grows, because that hardware cycle, it's also exponential. About a year ago, AMD had a 64 core chip. Their next one is 128 cores.
01:13:29.674 - 01:13:31.054, Speaker F: What about the m one?
01:13:31.914 - 01:13:55.602, Speaker B: So Apple's chips are not designed for servers, but they're awesome. If Apple made a server chip with a big pile of cores, that would be a perfect piece of hardware. Hey, guys.
01:13:55.738 - 01:14:12.314, Speaker F: Super, super cool, super excited. As a user, I love it. As an engineer in the space and somebody who believes in decentralization and the power of the phone in our pocket, is there any plan or thought in the future that the phone can be used as a decentralization point?
01:14:13.854 - 01:15:03.494, Speaker B: So obviously, like clients, like, there's a bunch of stuff we can do to make sure that when users interact with the network, that they're getting very high guarantees on safety. So things like that are totally possible. I think as phones get more and more powerful, who knows? There's going to be some inflection point where maybe this thing runs more than just a like line, but it's hard to predict how hardware grows. I think what's really important is that the custody piece is extremely robust and is scalable to a large number of people. Like, people need to be able to trust this thing as much as they do any other hardware wallet, and there's a lot of cool stuff we can do with all the biometrics and everything else on this device to make sure that is actually user friendly but also secure.
01:15:14.154 - 01:15:14.890, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:15.042 - 01:15:18.850, Speaker F: So outside of the US, Android teams.
01:15:18.962 - 01:15:21.174, Speaker C: Tends to be the most popular.
01:15:21.964 - 01:15:26.424, Speaker F: And I guess what is the plans for iOS integration with the stack?
01:15:28.004 - 01:15:42.304, Speaker B: I think if we need to succeed for Apple to make a change, everything's open source. Everything we're doing is completely open source. Anybody can pick it up. It'd be amazing to work with Apple to get them to do it, but really, the ball is in their court.
01:15:43.204 - 01:15:44.504, Speaker F: Yeah. Thank you.
01:15:53.784 - 01:16:36.534, Speaker B: So I come from the AR VR space, doing quite a bit stuff in there, actually, with the man who just talked recently, very recently at MIT. But my question is, so you. Qualcomm just dropped a AR concept. Very slick pair of glasses that look like they're going to shake some things up in that space. Any details on Solana hardware integrations partnerships? My last project at Qualcomm was getting the form factor device to run project Tango, which was like the first AR thing out of Google, so no comment. All right.
01:16:44.404 - 01:17:16.004, Speaker G: Hey, totally. And Raj, melody here, long time. I actually want to ask you, because Samsung had a phone with a wallet integrated a few years ago and never really took off, why do you think we can make it a success? Even one of the biggest hardware or mobile phone manufacturer couldn't make it work. And how do we get this operating system on other Android phones?
01:17:17.064 - 01:17:58.998, Speaker B: So SMS can be adopted by Samsung? That would be awesome. It's an open platform, a bunch of open source code. I think the reason why it's different is because it's us doing it for our users in crypto that we know really well and we really care about their experience and we know their use cases, and we're really targeting those hardcore people that understand what self custody means. And that's really important. You got to start with a group that's going to love this product and grow from there. And that's really hard to do for companies outside of crypto that just want to come in and build a crypto product, it often doesn't quite match. And you also need devs.
01:17:58.998 - 01:18:30.334, Speaker B: You need devs that are willing to build applications for crypto users. You guys still remember the 2018 2019 bear market, right? There was not 2 million people signing transactions, but there were still devs grinding, building product, trying to figure out product market fit. So those are the devs that we really need to enable for this device. The people that are true believers that believe that sometimes that timeline, three years to a billion users, is going to kickstart and they're the ones that can do it.
01:18:31.194 - 01:19:14.142, Speaker I: Just to add to that, as this market downturn happened, we watched our metrics that we care about, the ones that Anatoly showed on screen, and we were kind of surprised, but kind of not surprised that these armies of people that really care about nfts basically didn't care about the market swings. The numbers just kept going up. They are behaving exactly as they were before. I think many of them see themselves much more as part of a cultural movement than a technological movement. And so we see a sticky user behavior that seems to be growing independent of market conditions. And the builders are coming, and they're higher quality than before. If you saw magic Eater and Phantom.
01:19:14.142 - 01:20:26.084, Speaker I: So many of these applications already built on Solana are super high quality designers and developers and they've been feeling and seeing these pain points and they're ready to position for the next leg of user growth and we all just see it. We know that mobile needs to be unblocked and I think the goal here and the commitment from Solana Labs, everyone working on Solana mobile stack and awesome on the hardware side is to see this thing through. This is built from the ground up all the way to the App Store, the fee model and the no restrictions on tokens or nfts to be a completely free sandbox for all of those power users, the degens and these thousands of developers that have already been building on Solana for a few years. And we're willing to see this through for years if that's what it takes to catalyze adoption and growth in mobile. And if it ends up being that we just prove out some applications and use cases that get Samsung and Apple moving faster, that's a huge success in our mind here. Hi, my name is Ashik Ed. I'm really intrigued by what you've built.
01:20:26.124 - 01:20:44.124, Speaker F: Here and I had some questions about seed vault. So, specifically curious, have you given much thought to social recovery? If I lose my phone, what do I do? And also what sorts of things can I do? At seed vault, you talked about signing transactions, but I'm also curious about like, you know, if I want to encrypt a message with my private key or things like that.
01:20:45.384 - 01:21:17.604, Speaker D: Yep. So the seed vault implementation that we announced today is going to start with bit 39 passphrases, very traditional and everyone knows them, but that's not where we wanted to end. We know that to scale this phone up to a much larger audience, we need to explore other ways that users can recover their seats. And so we're excited to explore the whole spectrum there. So when we launch Bip 39 passphrases, but we will be definitely looking towards what we can really deliver to a better user experience of seed phrase recovery.
01:21:20.344 - 01:21:44.204, Speaker C: How's it going? My name is Grant. I kind of come from the Kevin chu rally forte lineage. So love seeing what you guys are building. Now we're spinning off doing block tackle. I wanted to get you one of the slides that you guys had up there was gaming and how gaming fits into saga. I want to know what your guys thoughts are with mobile games. Web MMO games kind of built on saga as we see forte investing in some of these projects.
01:21:44.204 - 01:21:47.064, Speaker C: Where do you guys see gaming featuring out through Solana.
01:21:47.484 - 01:22:25.586, Speaker B: So gaming, I think, is just obviously tied to crypto in the future. One of the first games that I really started playing was Ultima online. That was probably the first social network that I was a part of. And I remember going to the bank, getting a cashier's check and mailing it to some rando to get a digital item. So, yeah, that was my teenage years. It was really popular. But that experience of people getting together around a digital thing and valuing those digital items is just so obvious and natural.
01:22:25.586 - 01:22:46.694, Speaker B: So I think how crypto works, nfts work, I think, is extremely tied to gaming. And obviously the Dapp store that we're building has no extractive fees. All digital items can be traded, sold, whatever. That's perfect for gaming. That's really where things should go. And it's very different from how Apple and Google think of those App Stores today.
01:22:49.294 - 01:22:51.934, Speaker D: Hey, guys, Bruno from Agna. I have a question.
01:22:52.014 - 01:22:53.542, Speaker B: I'm thinking about using this phone and.
01:22:53.598 - 01:23:26.554, Speaker D: My day to day life and all the interactions that I have with my phone. Have you thought about other hardware interactions like NFC interactions or peer to peer payments or even just can I get my empire Dao NFT and then use my phone to tap in and get in? Yep. So best part of this device is it's. It's a full Android device. It is the full GM's stack on there. This isn't going to be some device to carry as just a second device. This is going to be a phone, and it's going to support all the awesome things that Android does.
01:23:26.554 - 01:23:47.578, Speaker D: And so with SMS on this device, you'll be able to build all the traditional awesome Android experiences and tie them in to your web3 world so you can tie them into nfts, your wallet experiences, et cetera. That sounds awesome. And I would love to be able to unlock the door of Empire Dao by tapping my saga on it.
01:23:47.666 - 01:23:47.890, Speaker F: Yeah.
01:23:47.922 - 01:23:59.734, Speaker A: And you saw just a taste of this too, with a kiyomi demo using cupcake, which does use nfcs to direct you to minting. So developers are starting to experiment with that tech and I think we're all really excited to see where it goes.
01:24:03.074 - 01:24:18.326, Speaker B: Yeah. Hey, guys, over here. It's Aidan. Love your, love your talk today. Quick question. So I love the fact that we're now moving natively towards mobile, but I'm always wondering about cross chain compatibility. I know we're a little, a few years out.
01:24:18.326 - 01:24:44.884, Speaker B: So people building on this stack, what kind of future plans and roadmaps do you have for more of a cross chain native UI future? It's open source, so people need to, they can contribute code. Like, we will see this, think, develop and grow. Obviously we're Solana Maxis. We're thinking Solana first for all the features, but everyone's welcome. It's a bunch of open source code. Apache 2.0.
01:24:46.784 - 01:24:48.284, Speaker D: Put up pull requests.
01:24:50.584 - 01:25:00.540, Speaker B: Hey guys, Nam from monkeydao. First of all, how many GitHub commits do I need for whitelist for the phone you're in?
01:25:00.652 - 01:25:24.456, Speaker I: Definitely. Connect your GitHub account on the pre order. I saw a bunch of people already pulling up the pre order flow on their mobile devices. Connect your GitHub, connect your Twitter, tell us what you've been building. Anatoly, emphasize this in the presentation. But I'll just say it again, we are absolutely prioritizing developers who have been. Anatolia calls them eating glass for years.
01:25:24.456 - 01:25:44.604, Speaker I: You know, building, using smart contracts on any chain and trying to find product market fit for this technology that we know is really powerful and has a lot of potential. So those are the ones we're prioritizing. No strict rules to announce today on how we're prioritizing developers, but I think I know you. I'm pretty sure you'll get in.
01:25:46.264 - 01:26:25.694, Speaker B: I appreciate that. My real question is, Anatolia, you mentioned that you think the phone is powerful enough to run a validator one day. Obviously, maybe that's not validator connection requirements notwithstanding, and handling the network throughput. Are you at the point where you think, sometime in the next five years, or we could actually run mobile validators? So I think if we are growing to a billion users, we're likely going to need bigger boxes to run the network than the phone. But definitely stuff like. Like lines doing, like, verification of a partial state from a known checkpoint. I think that should totally be totally doable.
01:26:25.694 - 01:27:06.314, Speaker B: But, like, the real complexity in running these networks is keeping up to date with the latest state in real time, and that takes just a lot of bandwidth, but actually getting the part of the state and validating it and just checking it locally, maybe? Yeah, we'll see. But those chips are getting twice as big every two years, so who knows? I started really building in 2003 those straight out of college, and in those ten years, we went from four megabyte microcontroller to smartphone supercomputer. And it's crazy how fast that goes.
01:27:09.314 - 01:27:10.498, Speaker C: Hey, I'm Jackson.
01:27:10.546 - 01:27:22.162, Speaker B: Over here to the. Over here. Yeah, no worries. So I work on helping individuals who aren't necessarily like web3 native kind of get into the space and unlock.
01:27:22.178 - 01:27:25.554, Speaker C: Some of the cool things that you can do with web3 technologies.
01:27:25.674 - 01:27:29.938, Speaker B: And it sounds like obviously this phone is geared towards the core community who are developers.
01:27:29.986 - 01:27:32.130, Speaker C: But as a developer who focuses on.
01:27:32.242 - 01:28:13.884, Speaker B: Bringing in those other billion users, where are some of the friction or pain points that you see right now that we as the Solana developer community can work on to help that become a reality? So I mean, try to pre order the phone right now. I did with USDC Phantom is doing an awesome job trying to make that as smooth as possible, but we just want that to be a delightful experience like you have with apple Pit. Like, why isn't that the case? So stuff like this, that applications that you imagine would work once you have full control of the stack, I'd love to see dev start imagining those.
01:28:15.104 - 01:28:44.664, Speaker D: I would also add that there's so many people excited to build mobile stuff in this world. People love their phones. They live on their phones. The fact that you haven't been able to as effectively build for Solana on a mobile device device, I am thrilled that we're going to get to make that a thing of the past. Take your phone, build web3 and Solana applications on something you take with you, and find those use cases that don't exist today, find the things that people care about that they just don't have a channel to deliver and build that.
01:28:44.784 - 01:29:23.604, Speaker A: Yeah, and part of what that dovetails into is the idea of if we are going to live in an NFT based metaverse, this technology is really going to become the way you get into your office, but also very valuable artwork or your character in a game. The existing custody solutions are pretty rough. For that, you either have to trust a lot in a pure software solution or you have to bring a full hardware wallet with you. Neither of those. They both have compromises in them. And you see something like seed Vault is really an ability to meet in the middle and try and figure out new ways that users can feel secure bringing stuff with them that is valuable, but also they want to make it part of their daily lives.
01:29:25.504 - 01:30:02.484, Speaker G: Hi Galena Fundakevitur here. I have a two part question. The first one is some context. The tools that are being released are allowing for some pretty cool products to come out, but the use cases aren't as compelling for a product to hit network effects. So how do you imagine these tools are going to allow for someone create a network effect product that's going to hit the mainstream? And the second part of that is how are you going to fix the reliability issues that would allow the mainstream to trust such a product.
01:30:04.144 - 01:30:05.324, Speaker B: I'll take the second.
01:30:05.664 - 01:30:06.784, Speaker I: Can I start with the second one?
01:30:06.824 - 01:30:26.624, Speaker B: Yeah. So devs are doing something. There's a major release roughly every three months, and every time we'll ten x users, the implementation is going to get stressed. Every time we ten x the validator numbers, things are going to get stressed. But that's just one more release. This just takes one release to fix shipping. L1.
01:30:26.624 - 01:30:49.464, Speaker B: Software is probably the closest thing in software world to shipping hardware. There's a lot of things that can go wrong and you got to be really careful. Every line of code is stomach churning. But we've gotten pretty good at it and things are getting faster and cheaper and better. And you can see that with the latest 1.10 release, network is humming. Serum was awesome during the crazy volatility.
01:30:49.464 - 01:30:57.424, Speaker B: So like, you know, let's get the users and the engineers will fix. We'll figure out everything else. Yeah.
01:30:57.464 - 01:31:46.816, Speaker A: And in terms of looking at something like the use cases, you know, what you see here today is a very early look at people, people who've spent maybe a few weeks looking at what an implementation could look like when they have access to a full Android phone they can build native apps for. If you go back to the early days of smartphones, I think it would have been a real stretch to look at the first iPhone and be like, yeah, Tinder. That's what's going to come out of this thing. So a lot of these use cases, they're not apparent at the beginning, but you get there over time. And to be fair, this is exactly what happened with nfts on the network. NFTs were not something that was originally a place of like, oh, this is going to really hit product market fit. That was a bunch of developers taking creators, taking tooling that was pretty early stage back in the day and doing something on it that was not really anticipated.
01:31:46.816 - 01:32:22.352, Speaker A: And so the dynamics that made the network really great for DeFi also make it really great for large nfts that you don't have to think, especially in early days, you don't have to think a lot about before you buy because there's not a $400 transaction fee associated with creating that piece of art. So I think we'll see where the tools lead people. And the other part of that is it's a very open platform that's being built here. So if there are needs that developers find in that process of, oh, I wish I could do this thing, or we see that there are a lot of different developers rebuilding the same framework to do one thing. That's how the open source process works.
01:32:22.508 - 01:32:38.736, Speaker D: And myself and my development team will be on Discord. If you have ideas you want to talk about the SDK, find out what's in it, learn more, come find us. Solanamobile.com has more details. Hey, as a developer, super stoked on.
01:32:38.760 - 01:32:47.056, Speaker F: The focus of developer tooling today. But as a customer, I'd be super excited to hear about OS level or.
01:32:47.120 - 01:33:38.864, Speaker D: System, apparently integrations that you guys are able to do, kind of controlling the full stack. So with the full stack, one of the things we talked about as we were conceptualizing SMS and what's going to go in it is how do we make sure that we can deliver the most cool things we can for as many people as possible. And so some parts of SMS seed vault, for example, are going to be delivered first on the saga. But other parts, like mobile wallet adapter, those are going to be reference implementations and protocols that are free and available for everyone to pick up and start using outside of saga as well. And so that part of SMS, the impact that we're looking for there, is opening up the Android mobile ecosystem very, very broadly to the creators to start building those cool experiences.
01:33:39.604 - 01:33:40.504, Speaker F: Thank you.
01:33:41.304 - 01:33:41.872, Speaker H: Awesome.
01:33:41.968 - 01:34:10.236, Speaker A: Well, thank you all for joining us today. There will be immediately following this, please join us downstairs for some time to chat about SMS, and Antoi will have a saga that he might show you. Thank you all.
01:34:10.340 - 01:34:10.964, Speaker B: Don't drop it.
