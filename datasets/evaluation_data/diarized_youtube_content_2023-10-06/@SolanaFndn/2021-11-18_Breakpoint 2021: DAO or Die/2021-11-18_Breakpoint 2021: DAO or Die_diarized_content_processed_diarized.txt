00:00:15.560 - 00:00:17.510, Speaker A: Oh, watch it.
00:00:17.542 - 00:00:39.994, Speaker B: Testing, testing. Hello, everyone. Welcome to our panel. Today we're here in the Dao or dai panel with some of the DaO experts in the field, Solana ecosystem and other ecosystems. So very good to have you all up here. The format for this panel is actually going to be very loose. I'm not going to try and give these guys too many questions because they're much more experts on this subject than I am.
00:00:39.994 - 00:01:00.914, Speaker B: So I just want them to talk in between themselves. If anyone has a question for someone else on the panel, please feel free to do so. Don't need to wait for me to have a question to start. But I guess to get this kicked off, my question to each of you is, what do you see as a dao and what are you working around in the world of Daos, if you'd like to start, Gustav?
00:01:01.814 - 00:01:09.194, Speaker C: I mean, I think, like, is it working? Okay, there we go.
00:01:12.534 - 00:01:16.766, Speaker D: Okay, stick it, stick it.
00:01:16.910 - 00:01:17.982, Speaker E: We're off to a great start.
00:01:18.038 - 00:01:19.156, Speaker D: Stick it like this.
00:01:19.350 - 00:01:22.048, Speaker C: Maybe. Julian, you can go first. Yeah, I think it fell off.
00:01:22.096 - 00:01:23.352, Speaker B: Max, you want to take it off?
00:01:23.448 - 00:01:26.352, Speaker D: Okay, can you repeat the question?
00:01:26.448 - 00:01:27.224, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:01:27.264 - 00:01:27.844, Speaker A: So.
00:01:29.744 - 00:01:36.280, Speaker B: I'd love to hear what is a dao to you and what are you working on that pertains to this subject?
00:01:36.432 - 00:01:37.104, Speaker D: Okay.
00:01:37.224 - 00:01:37.456, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:37.480 - 00:02:08.024, Speaker D: For me, Dao is really about bringing people together with a shared vision, but without claiming ownership of their whole identity. It's really about bringing people in an anonymous and very easy going way to work on something. Maybe on the weekend, maybe more full time, maybe their whole fucking life, but without demanding like total loyalty. So for me it has really like a hardcore anarchist vibe, like we're giving people something, but we're not forcing them to anything.
00:02:10.023 - 00:02:10.335, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:10.359 - 00:02:44.224, Speaker E: I mean, for me I just see it as the natural evolution of what's been happening in the concept and the philosophy of open source to begin with. So if you look back about eleven years ago, GitHub really started to drive a lot of the open source development, which meant teams could come from all around the world and collaborate on open source software. And now Daos are actually expanding that well beyond just software developers. It's basically anybody that wants to participate in a network and share their skills, be a part of a community. And I think that that's extremely powerful because it takes the open source philosophy and extends it way beyond just software development.
00:02:47.204 - 00:03:34.598, Speaker A: Yeah. So my personal experience with Daos are like, I'm involved in four different daos, like Curve, finance, Stake, Dao, Blackpool and Rec News. And this is like full time. So the point is with Daos, you can be involved in many different projects without having the title of full time in just one company. So even if I'm full time in those different projects, I can still be involved in all the different projects in the ecosystem. And just by participating inside those projects, I can earn those governance tokens that in traditional finance you can associate them to equity. But that's, that's the point is like, whatever you do in this car system, you wake up in the morning, you walk all day, you acquire Dow shares in the entire ecosystem.
00:03:34.598 - 00:03:43.194, Speaker A: So you feel you actually be part of this entire family of building this entire new paradigm that is competing with traditional finance.
00:03:45.294 - 00:04:28.010, Speaker C: Yeah, I think my microphone works now. So, yeah, I've been like part of megadal for almost three and a half years now. So kind of like seeing the progression we've had there where we went from working on a centralized foundation to now being a full on DAO when I just decision making. But salaries, like basically everything, even product direction, is taken under a DAO format. And apart from that, I also work with a lot of the portfolio companies we have at stable node with building their governance frameworks and structures. So at stable node, we both build, help them define what the problem is. Process frameworks needs to look like, but we also become like an active participant afterwards.
00:04:28.010 - 00:05:06.884, Speaker C: So we are like an active participant and active delegate in several other protocols, both DeFi protocols and like layer one networks. And I also think, like today we see there's like many different types of Daos, right? I think we've also seen especially like the investment Daos and like art collection Daos really like gaining momentum where it's just like a way for people to collaborate under like a different setting, I guess a setting where I can share the financial outcome of what you're doing in a fair and equal way. And there's of course, many types of governance and many types of daos. So, yeah, it's a very broad topic, I guess.
00:05:07.424 - 00:05:43.050, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And I think you touched on something quite interesting, which was at maker at the beginning, it was a team that came together, it could be considered centralized, and then it had this progression to becoming a DaO. I think that's a very not contentious, but a subject that everyone needs to discuss and think about, because in this industry, a lot of these different businesses will have to move to that model to be safe in a regulatory environment. But I'd love to hear like advice or a roadmap from you guys on how companies that maybe start with two co founders or three co founders can expand that into a DaO format and actually get to a place where it is decentralized. Julian, you want to kick it off?
00:05:43.162 - 00:06:33.294, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. We started a year and a half ago. Two years ago, that was like five people. And now, like, I know, like, there's a 40 chairs on Twitter, but now we're, like 75 people across those many different projects. So you can start really quick, quickly into, like, an idea and then bootstrap a project. But what's really cool is by using those, like, building a Dao right now, there's, like, few different aspects of the Dao you can follow, and that will make at least the functioning of the Dao pretty efficient. So you'll do, like, snapshot that basically, and then a forum that basically will incentivize or will get people to add value to your project or add feedback.
00:06:33.294 - 00:07:11.184, Speaker A: And snapshot is for voting mechanism on top of your Dao. And then you have the Telegram group, the Discord channel. But, like, having all those different mechanisms, you can just buy one idea and a few different smart contracts. You can bootstrap an entire idea that will normally take, in traditional finance, a couple of years to reach. So you can, like, yeah, we start, like, five guys, five people last year, two years ago, and now we, like, 75 people. The company is registered, multiple different companies, and we paying high salaries, like governance tokens, participation in all those different projects. So it's fascinating.
00:07:11.604 - 00:08:01.526, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, from my perspective as an american, it's extremely hard to do this correctly and legally. And so one of the downsides to trying to create a doubt within the United States is that the regulatory landscape is so gray and unclear that you actually have a lot of teams leaving the United States to actually do this or having to do this pseudonymously. So I'm not suggesting leave the United States to actually start a dao. I'm just saying, if you are an american, it's one thing you have to consider, is that me and a couple of guys were hacking on a project, actually, in one of the Solana hackathons, and we went two months into talking to lawyers about this, and we got nowhere because it's so difficult to actually do this in a compliant way. And so I think it's actually, you're going to continue to see a rise in pseudonymity with members of daos, especially those for those coming out of the United States.
00:08:01.630 - 00:08:05.510, Speaker A: That's what people do. They build daos in Europe and they raise money in the US.
00:08:05.622 - 00:08:06.474, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:08:06.854 - 00:08:08.958, Speaker A: Perfect. Big money in the US.
00:08:09.046 - 00:08:09.838, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:08:09.966 - 00:09:35.000, Speaker C: I think also, like, the panel title is kind of like saying in that way, too, that everyone right now is in this situation where a lot of people speculate that if you don't move towards this decentralized setup, we might actually die. As a project, you become much more exposed to centralized risk, not only on your team side, but also just from a regulatory standpoint. Everyone needs to think about at what stage are we actually mature enough to move into a full DAO structure. For example, what we did at maker, and I thinkmaker is probably the furthest one on this topic here, where you have even the product decisions, where I think a lot of the teams in this space, they have decent decision making in some form, but it's not really there yet, where even the community decide the product direction. You would still see a lot of the big teams deciding which products to build, when to release them, and prioritize the development resources. I think from my perspective, and also what we did at Maker was basically saying, at what stage is the product mature enough for us to release it out to the community? What do we need to have built for them to kind of like, take over? So with Maker, it was, you know, releasing and bootstrapping multicollateral die and making sure that they had been running for, I think it was six months or something, nine months. Then, of course, March 12 happened, which then made it very clear that we needed a new liquidation system.
00:09:35.000 - 00:10:00.004, Speaker C: So that kind of, like, got prioritized. And then, like, once those building stones were put in place, then, you know, they kind of, like, the team and the foundation was at a stage where we could actually release the product back to the community. Right. So that is, like, where we are now, where there's no foundation, there's no centralized corporation. Everyone works directly for the DAO. Everyone gets paid by the DAO to get a job at maker. Now you basically have to apply to the Dao for them to onboard you.
00:10:00.004 - 00:10:21.254, Speaker C: So, yeah, it's like, from my standpoint, it's like you need to figure out at what stage are we mature enough to actually do this? And this is, you know, like, steps on, like, the road of, like, the path towards decentralization, where you use the term gradual decentralization. You shouldn't do it from day one. That will make your life very difficult. But you should definitely look at what stage are we able to actually release this.
00:10:21.754 - 00:10:30.018, Speaker D: Well, I tend to disagree. We tried to launch the Dao before everything, actually. Yeah, it was kind of crazy.
00:10:30.106 - 00:10:31.014, Speaker C: How was it?
00:10:31.394 - 00:10:55.876, Speaker D: Awesome. Really awesome. I mean, it also meant building shit, tons of infrastructure around it. Maybe made a slower and first few steps, I would say. But then it created, like all these incentives for people who are really, really smart to get into the project and decide this is their thing. We have a hedge fund trader. He's running his own fund and his free time, he's trading on mango.
00:10:55.876 - 00:11:34.484, Speaker D: He literally comes home and continues trading with, instead of equities, it's perpetuals. And he's giving support while he's at work. I was just wondering, how in the world could this be possible if it was, wouldn't have decided to open up right away, even when the product isn't finished yet. Right. While it's still shaping and bringing all these people with different perspectives together, especially from day one. Make sure that you don't have this team barrier, which is something we've been always really, really aware as founders, like the people who start the project. Everyone tells you, oh, you're a founder, but what does it mean, right? Because by now there's so many people working on this project.
00:11:34.484 - 00:11:57.264, Speaker D: I hope they're working harder than me. Actually, I think most of them do and aren't data founders. Don't they deserve to be called the founders? So what's the point where we say it was founded, right? And I think it starts with the Dao. It doesn't start with a tech demo or something on GitHub. It's when you actually sit down, decide, okay, this is how it's going to roll, and this is everyone's stake. Right.
00:11:59.024 - 00:12:00.804, Speaker E: And how's that working out for you?
00:12:02.064 - 00:12:38.474, Speaker D: I mean, I would say the part that we kind of messed up was the fair launch part. We tried to do something that gives equal access, but then in the end, you know, it's like, I think it's the same story with Leia ones it's often not talked about. But there's some actors who are willing to take the risk and go in really early in, really, really high stakes. And that, of course, poses a huge risk to the idea of decentralization, because suddenly you have these mainly financially motivated people who are like 10%, 20%. Right. Of the, of the voting stake, and you need to figure out how you deal with that.
00:12:38.594 - 00:13:03.366, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, that's what happened to curve finance. Yeah, yeah. Big players trying to take control of the Dow. And it's tough. Yeah. Then you end up with, like, players that playing 40 chess, not necessarily in the interest of the Dow, but more in the economical interest for themselves. So that's why it's dangerous.
00:13:03.366 - 00:13:45.314, Speaker A: The DAO is like people getting involved in the DAO, they're not necessarily having the same vision as you, as a, as a builder, as building the project. It doesn't necessarily mean that they know they don't have a great vision or they don't actually pushing the product for the best of the product. But most of the time in this ecosystem, people are pushed for economical reasons. And so it's very likely that people that have a huge, huge stake in the protocol will short term or medium term sell the asset and try to make it. Sure. So then they can jump into another project. So that's why my personal experience building a Dao is good.
00:13:45.314 - 00:14:22.324, Speaker A: But having a fully decentralized Dao from day, from day one, I haven't seen any dao that's successfully made it. So in a Dao, you need strong leadership. And also after the DaO is like kind of like fully decentralized, you still need strong leadership. Even if those people that wait their voice online have hold stake and shares in the protocol. Because people, it's good to say like people, they understand the vision, they understand how to push the product, but most of the time, 99% of those people are more like incentivized by the money.
00:14:22.364 - 00:14:56.516, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, you can also have like a lot of different shapes of a Dao, right? Like, I'm like a big supporter of like delegates as well as like domain experts. So, you know, you would, you would have like in like for example, like at mango markets, you would probably need people who's like experts within like trading or like derivatives, like auction methods. And I would say, like, from my perspective, I think putting extra responsibility over to people who got voted in by the rest or delegated tokens too, because you trusted their work, their expert opinion. I think that works better than having a completely open voting process. Right?
00:14:56.580 - 00:15:18.080, Speaker A: Yeah, but still, you can still build a layer of bribing on top of it. Of course, then the people that bribe, tell or direct, like incentivize governance decision in such a way that will incentivize the delegates to delegate in that specific path. And at the end, you just like have an extra layer on top of an extra layer and then govern the Dow.
00:15:18.192 - 00:15:30.164, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, like, of course, like influencing delegates or something like that can always happen, but of course, like, hopefully you would be able to spot it at some point and people would hopefully remove their delegation from them.
00:15:30.584 - 00:15:32.804, Speaker A: No, because they will make money, more money for them.
00:15:33.144 - 00:15:33.712, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:33.808 - 00:15:37.684, Speaker A: It's like the situation at the moment with convex and curve.
00:15:38.024 - 00:15:40.776, Speaker C: Like curve is also like a very special example, right?
00:15:40.840 - 00:15:58.868, Speaker A: Well, like in, I think it's git coin or like ens. Now they're starting to think about introducing rewards for the delegates. What's easy, you can just like build an incentive incentivization program that will just direct the out, do certain things.
00:15:59.036 - 00:16:27.622, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a question, actually. So going back to Max's point around the IDO and around trying to think of mechanisms that you can have fair distribution of these governance tokens so that you actually perhaps get a spread out participation across the field. Now that you did the way that you went, and you guys have seen other models, have you thought on ways that you could have done a better model of token distribution for the DAO? Or like, what do you guys as well think are interesting ways to actually have a fair distribution of DAO tokens? Max, if you'd like to start, I.
00:16:27.638 - 00:16:38.994, Speaker D: Mean, we thought the whole time maybe we should just do an airdrop to everyone who got liquidated. Kind of like, yeah, but then maybe that's not the smartest people to start with.
00:16:41.094 - 00:16:42.154, Speaker E: That's cold.
00:16:44.494 - 00:17:17.572, Speaker D: I don't know, it's really, really tricky. I mean, fundamentally, you're trying to solve like, you don't want to give like huge stake to people who are never going to contribute back, right? So you want to incentivize people who are actually really active by themselves. You also want to give them the power to change the project and the direction. Because usually the knowledge sits on the outside, right? It sits where people are actually working, doing the work, seeing the code, talking with the customer. It's not necessarily in the VC office that the strategy is decided.
00:17:17.698 - 00:17:23.524, Speaker B: Like, how do you do that? It's clear who deserves the tokens. How do you make sure those people get the tokens?
00:17:23.904 - 00:18:03.764, Speaker D: Our plan still is that there's a huge part of the treasury on spend and we're just going to distribute it, hopefully mercilessly, to developers. I personally would love that, but unfortunately, there's no more opinions than the DAO. But I think if we keep the spirit of just overpaying people and governance tokens purely, that means that people have a very long term vision for the project when they accept this kind of reimbursement. And if we manage to distribute it in a way that really the, I would say top 100 people that built this project, right. The people who really committed their lives in the end are large owners of it. That would be ideal, Joe?
00:18:04.584 - 00:18:48.854, Speaker E: Well, I mean, I'll say I may or may not have participated in the public sale. So I actually thought it was brilliant. I thought it was really fair for outsiders that actually weren't actively participating in Mango, because if you saw Mango and the path the product was actually taking, it felt like there was cohesion amongst the people that were actually building it. And you could see that the roadmap was, excuse me, going to be creating even better features, a better experience for trading perpetuals, excuse me, joining your spot, trading, et cetera, et cetera. And so I felt like this is something I want to actually support irrespective of how the price actually maps out. It's ultimately, of course, gone up in value because you have more and more people using it. More and more people are evangelizing it.
00:18:48.854 - 00:19:08.544, Speaker E: I'm evangelizing it. I think it's actually a great product. So I actually think it was a fair approach to actually distributing tokens on the public sale. That's different, I think, than how you would actually distribute them with people within the DAO. Myself being a software developer for a long time, I completely agree. I think the people that are actually doing the work are the ones that should be compensated the most.
00:19:10.484 - 00:19:52.468, Speaker C: Don't you think if you overcompensate people who are the contributors to a DAO, don't you think that you would end up in a situation where you have not just a concentration of the tokens to that team, but also the team that is the easiest for them to collude because all of them are in the same chat channels, slack, discord, whatever you use Telegram, they know each other, they build this project together, and they're also now probably at least like the majority of the largest token holders. That is like the easiest way to create a concentration of power that would exclude the external community to maybe want to participate because that, you know, like now the majority of voting power lies within the team structure. How do you avoid that?
00:19:52.516 - 00:19:54.544, Speaker E: Well, I was going to say, what do you suggest is an alternative?
00:19:55.044 - 00:19:55.404, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:55.444 - 00:20:14.056, Speaker E: So on the one hand, if people are going to be actively contributing, shouldn't they be getting compensated? On the other hand, if they're going to be to the tier point, could potentially be colluding because there's a group of ten X developers that all get together and they have this large chunk of the treasury. Well, how do you, what's the alternative to that?
00:20:14.200 - 00:20:31.794, Speaker D: I really like actually the model you guys are doing. I think Mango will transition into that. We can't do it like from day one because I think for most people it's too spooky. I don't expect anyone who met me in Lisbon to go and you know, found a Delaware corporation and apply for a grant from the Dow.
00:20:34.214 - 00:20:36.134, Speaker B: What is that model that Max is mentioning?
00:20:36.214 - 00:21:51.180, Speaker C: Yeah, so I mean, so at mega right now, we have, we have like kind of like two parts of it, right? There's of course like the compensation where like right now actually, I'm not sure if like the MKR vesting is live for the contributors yet, but you know, like you get paid directly by the DAO, like everyone, everything is like out in the open, like very transparent. And then we also have a governance process, like a governance method and setup where we actually, I wouldn't say remove the power from the token holders, but reduce the power from the token holders. Most of the governance process is actually done without the need to have any significant amount of tokens. We of course have on chain polling where you need tokens, and on chain voting in the end, like the executive order where something passes in the end where you need tokens. But whatever ends up in both the poll and in the executive vote in the end is defined in a preterm process. So there you can actually, we have tried to build a setup where you can eliminate the strong hand that in most of the governance systems we see today, where they are heavily reliant on token voting as the significant truth and what actually gets put in. You can only make a proposal if you have tokens and then it goes to voting, and if you have a lot of tokens, you can just pass it through.
00:21:51.180 - 00:21:58.356, Speaker C: So instead we had a different process where the power of the token itself is kind of removed from the governance structure.
00:21:58.540 - 00:22:00.704, Speaker B: Thank you, Julian. Any thoughts on this?
00:22:01.204 - 00:23:24.730, Speaker A: Well, I've got one or two stories fair launch. The problem is, what we experience is so in token, like in product you have yield farming, but you also have contributors farming. So what happens is when you launch a project, you will find some people like anonymous, and they contribute to your project, but the intention is just to grab like this kind of fairlance tokens and acquire a lot of shares, but then they disappear and this happened a lot of different projects that I've met and also personally and also like, you have this, I mean, we're writing a story like on rect and, but you also have some entities in the world that are specialized in this, like kind of like scamming entities that basically specialize in early stage projects to acquire a percentage of the governance and then they either disappear or they dump or like they threaded the project. So it's difficult that to select. Back then we are like Merkel trees, airdrop type of things for gitcoin community, for people that participating in the governance of projects. But what you realize is that most of the time those people are not actually contributing back to your project. You can track those addresses and they're like, they had an airdrop.
00:23:24.730 - 00:23:48.134, Speaker A: They contribute, they vote into curve or they vote into aave or maker. But the reason for that is they either got incentivized to do so or they were bribed by someone and then they completely disappear. Yeah. I mean, for me, Dao, without strong leadership from start, it's kind of like difficult. And we've seen it in a pain in a place, like a lot. Yeah.
00:23:48.994 - 00:24:10.060, Speaker C: I mean, touch upon like another really good point, which is also something you're like, if you're like incentivized to participate in governance, like, if you paid for the actual vote itself, that also just like lead to, like much poorer, like, outcome for the project itself. Right. You should never, like, incentivize people to vote because then people would just vote without actually necessarily knowing what they vote for, like care about what they vote for.
00:24:10.132 - 00:24:13.028, Speaker A: The entire Defi is turning into bribing.
00:24:13.196 - 00:24:51.174, Speaker C: Yeah. We've also, we held like a workshop with a lot of the cosmos validators on Sunday governance workshop, where they say that they have a similar problem now, where if there's a vote out, for example, which is something that the people staking to them think is what they should vote for, but they actually want to vote opposite because it's better for the network. Well, if they go against the people delegating their stake to them, they will actually remove their stake. Right. This is like another example where you kind of have this, like, we have to vote this way, or we have to do like a vote that we don't even think is like the best, or we just vote because we're incentivized to do so. And that actually creates, like, very, very poor decision making. Right.
00:24:51.174 - 00:25:04.544, Speaker C: So you should be very careful around implementing economic incentives around voting itself because it would just lead to very poor decision making because people will just have to vote because they're getting paid. Right. Without necessarily being interested in the vote itself.
00:25:05.524 - 00:25:11.172, Speaker D: How many times did you have to text a whale on telegram, be like, hey, you need to vote on this every day.
00:25:11.268 - 00:25:12.184, Speaker B: Every day.
00:25:15.764 - 00:25:17.628, Speaker A: You see, we have the same experience. Right?
00:25:17.676 - 00:25:18.264, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:25:20.964 - 00:25:52.244, Speaker B: I have a somewhat specific question. This is something Max and I have talked about a ton. I'd of love to hear if people have ideas. So part of the issue is if you want to incentivize DAO members with locked tokens, if those tokens already have a high enough valuation upon reception of them, depending on the tax laws of the places those people are, it's taxed as income. So if you give someone a million dollars, perhaps they have 300k they have to pay, but they can't sell those tokens to pay. What are some mechanisms in which you can actually use locked tokens to incentivize DAO members? Or does it just have to be unlocked?
00:25:55.954 - 00:25:57.594, Speaker C: I wish I could give taxes.
00:25:57.634 - 00:25:59.106, Speaker E: None of us are lawyers or tax.
00:25:59.170 - 00:26:02.974, Speaker A: People, so we're like, I'm scared it's being recording.
00:26:03.994 - 00:26:04.954, Speaker B: Fair enough.
00:26:05.114 - 00:26:10.854, Speaker D: If someone knows about it, I mean, if anyone knows, please come. We all have a problem.
00:26:14.634 - 00:26:43.154, Speaker B: Okay, sorry. So transitioning out of that one, but that is something that needs to be solved. There needs to be a way to be able to incentivize people, people in daos with lock tokens. Would you guys say then, like, from what you're saying, even though the DAO could be a programmatic structure, initially, at the end, like any human thing involved, it depends on integrity more than like. I guess my question here is, what's more important? Like, powerful leadership, as far as someone that can bring and have guidance and a vision, or just having a group of people that may not have that much vision, but all have integrity and trust between each other.
00:26:43.774 - 00:27:17.252, Speaker C: So I think, like, also like, I think, like, from my perspective, whenever we talk about daos, a lot of people think, oh, we are going to create this community. It's going to be only amazingly smart people, and we're going to end up with better decision making. And it just very rarely happens. If you have a small internal team that are the true experts, they will almost always take better decisions than the community. You can have really smart people coming in, in the community, of course, but it will also be a lot of noise. People who have a very different perspective than you, or a different view. What is even the best objective outcome.
00:27:17.252 - 00:27:56.984, Speaker C: It's all about which direction we're going into. So the way that I often see a dao, and especially what we also see with Maker, I don't know if you guys have been following the drama that's been there lately, but with the whole delegates and these people, who takes on these roles, where they are facilitators of some kind of vertical or program, I often think that it shares bigger similarities to a democracy. They become protocol politicians, and they're having to govern the system rather than being directors and managers in a company. Right. For me, it's much more similar to a political system than to a company structure often.
00:27:57.724 - 00:28:30.646, Speaker E: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think one of the things that cryptocurrency has done is that it's digitally enabled, a concept that's been around for thousands of years, which is something we've all made up, which is money. And now daos have more or less digitally enabled politics or governance. And I think that there's ramifications that we're just not fully aware of yet. I think the incentives piece around if you're going to be getting paid for this in a token that has value. Well, politicians also get paid. And so there's going to be that kind of tension, but it's going to be in a decentralized and pseudonymous or anonymous way.
00:28:30.646 - 00:28:38.434, Speaker E: So we're basically taking some of the stuff that's happened in the real life world of politics and applying it into a decentralized environment.
00:28:40.984 - 00:28:41.764, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:42.344 - 00:28:43.568, Speaker D: Any thoughts or no?
00:28:43.656 - 00:28:59.784, Speaker A: Well, I mean like it's, it's funny because before like Defi and people in blockchain, they were chasing money. But then over the past year, now they're chasing lobbying and lobbying. Now it's starting to be more important than money because you can lobby is money?
00:28:59.824 - 00:29:00.264, Speaker C: No?
00:29:00.384 - 00:30:06.626, Speaker A: Well the thing is like if you have lobby you can direct money, but if you have money, you don't necessarily have lobby. So what's happening now is like all this new platform being built for bribing, incentivizing people to do certain, direct certain things. Because what we realize is when you have a stake in maker or staking curve or stake in Aave and all different things, those people that want to build on top of it, if you think about it, a project might have a TVL of 20 billion or 30 billion, but at the end of day what you want is to be connected to that project because you want to tap into that liquidity, you want to build on top of it. So the most important aspect is not actually how much money you raise because you will never be able to buy with the money. If you raise $20 million or $30 million, it's very unlikely that you can actually get yourself inside this protocol. What really counts is how many people will vote for you to get inside this protocol. So then the only way for you to get listed inside this protocol to build on top of it because we're talking about lending market, auto market maker, the basically the infrastructure of the entire traditional finance.
00:30:06.626 - 00:30:52.426, Speaker A: What we're currently building is not new. And you say like before it was a thousand years ago there was money, but whatever we're seeing in the Defi space is just that copy past of the traditional finance, financial products, but with a different stack, a different technology. And now what's happening is, as you mentioned, it's like the European Commission, it's like Europe. You have parliament, you have the European Commission, you have lobbyists around those big projects that then if you have sufficient power, sufficient lobbying, you can basically tell, okay, you can get listed, I will incentivize you to get there. You basically control the entire defi. And that's what is fascinating. But at the same time, it's very scary because now it's not a question of money, it's a question of governance, of lobbying.
00:30:52.426 - 00:30:53.454, Speaker A: It's happening.
00:30:53.834 - 00:31:09.304, Speaker B: Well, thank you so much to all of you. I actually am going to extend an invitation to perhaps do a podcast episode because I think we all touched on a lot of problems, and it'd be good to do an hour on solutions to these problems and then perhaps people can learn from that. So I appreciate your time here. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you to everyone.
