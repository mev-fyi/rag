00:00:03.760 - 00:00:57.320, Speaker A: Good to see everyone. Yeah, so this is the first time we're going to announce the winners of our online Hackathon Live. And yeah, before that we can just talk a little bit about the Solana hackathon program, generally go into some stats that were specific to hyperdrive, and then we'll get into the winners history of the hackathon program. So when Solana went to Mainnet, we had a small group of developers that were building projects, and we were trying to figure out how do we bring more really talented just developers, but also specifically startup founders to build companies on the network. And we did a bunch of different things. And one of the things we did pretty early on was running an online hackathon. And immediately we saw that there was a lot of success with that.
00:00:57.320 - 00:01:51.484, Speaker A: Even though there was only about 66 project submissions in 2020, it was still, that was a considerable amount given how many developers total were in the ecosystem. And so we decided to double down on that and really make Solana hackathons not like a traditional hackathon. So if anyone has participated in these events, you'll know that, one, they're online and global. Two, they're mostly focused on startup founders. While we do want people experimenting with Solana, and we want to welcome in new developers to learn about the technology and experiment and have people get hired into ecosystem companies, all of those folks are more than welcome to join our hackathons. But at the end of the day, what we're optimizing for in the structure of our hackathons are startup founders. And so we sort of stripped away a lot of the things that you'd normally see in hackathons, like specific bounties.
00:01:51.484 - 00:02:52.354, Speaker A: We want developers to come in with their own creative ideas and to build the startups that they could see building ten years from now. And so let's see, just to give some stats about the last three years of the hackathons we've been running, we've run eight. There's been about 4000 projects launched out of these. Total venture funding into hackathon winners has topped out at 650,000,080% of all vc backed startups in the Solana ecosystem started in our hackathon program. Thanks. And yeah, as I mentioned, wormhole was our first one in 2020. It was at the time a big success for us, and we've run eight over the course of the last three years, ending with hyperdrive most recently, where we topped out at 907 project submissions just to get into some more stats.
00:02:52.354 - 00:03:26.564, Speaker A: Like I said, these are online and we see participation from many, many different countries. So there was over 120 countries represented from builders. In our last hackathon, there was roughly 7000 total participants. Like I said before, there was 900 project submissions. And even of the finalists, there are 25 different countries represented. And so these are truly global events that I think mirror the global nature of an adoption of Solana generally. Okay, so this is the winners.
00:03:26.564 - 00:04:21.420, Speaker A: Took us quite a while to come up with these winners. And I just want to say that we feel that these winners are the best of the bunch, but there's at least 100 to 200 projects that are really fantastic that come out of this. And they don't necessarily get the winning prizes, but they are very much encouraged to continue building, and many of them do. There's been many examples of venture backed startups that have become very, very important to the ecosystem that entered hackathons but were not chosen as winners. Before we get into the actual winners, just want to really give a shout out to all the builders who, who participate in these events and make it the most competitive hackathon in the world. All right, so we're going to start with the tracks. So there was seven different tracks.
00:04:21.420 - 00:05:04.154, Speaker A: We'll start with the winners in each one of those, and then we'll move on to the individual prizes. And then finally the grand prize winner. So, finance and payments track. First we have Alexandria. First place, Lux House two, surfer, finance three, juicer four, and siegel one, five. And congrats to the finance and payments winners. Crypto infrastructure track.
00:05:04.154 - 00:05:56.984, Speaker A: We have epplex number one, ping number two, soul keeper three, fire three, four, and dau five. It's just awesome to see also some of these participants here. It's like so cool to see their reaction to winning these. It's amazing games and entertainment. Soulsieve number one, sync Studios. Number two, hyperdrive havoc number three. Fourth place went to geovers.
00:05:56.984 - 00:06:22.314, Speaker A: And five was football club owners. Next we have physical infrastructure networks. This is a deep end track. This is the first time we've ever run this particular use case track. And we saw some, but some pretty interesting stuff, and we'll probably continue to see it. Actually, IO.net came out of our last hackathon.
00:06:22.314 - 00:07:20.864, Speaker A: And so actually, we're sort of inspired to start with this track because of them. So first place goes to Chaga. Dane is second, albedo is three, four is vax choice chain, and five is cluster mobile consumer apps. This is a really competitive track. A lot of interesting ideas, but we feel that the first best team was solinked two, kizzy three clicks four, bind app. And five is three, tv. This is another new track.
00:07:20.864 - 00:07:53.874, Speaker A: We saw some really interesting takes with AI and using AI in different ways than we could have imagined. So, yeah, we're happy that we ran an AI track, and we'll continue to do so in the future. First is wisdom. Second is aperture. Third is byte in four is Friday. Five is Guardian. AI Dao is in network state's track.
00:07:53.874 - 00:08:17.014, Speaker A: I don't know if anyone made it out to the network state first day event, which is really cool. And so, you know, Bellagio was even a judge for this track, so it was exciting. Number one, pub key link. Number two, Tatami. Three is hub. Three. Four is dao create.
00:08:17.014 - 00:08:50.936, Speaker A: And five is Onda. So the next tracks are, we have a university award, a climate award, and a public goods award. These are individual prizes. So there's not tracks around these, but we just choose one individual project that we feel best exemplifies these individual attempts. So, university award, space fight. The public goes. Award goes to radiant and climbed.
00:08:50.936 - 00:09:25.004, Speaker A: Award goes to carbon pay. Okay, grand champion. Yeah. This was unanimously chosen by the judges. We got by far the most judges for a winning project, and we felt it was very deserved of it. And I hope they're here, but it's fluxbot. All right, thanks all for coming out.
00:09:25.004 - 00:09:46.476, Speaker A: It was really excited to announce the winners here in person. It's a lot better than just a blog post. We'll have a full blog post coming out just right now in a tweet thread. I just covered the winners. There's a lot of honorable mentions that we're extremely competitive and very close to winning. And so we're going to be running these hackathons two to three times a year in the future. And so, please come back.
00:09:46.476 - 00:09:58.324, Speaker A: Keep going at it. It often takes teams multiple tries to becoming a winning project. And so really appreciate, again, everyone coming out and really respect all the builders in the ecosystem who compete in these competitions. So thank you.
