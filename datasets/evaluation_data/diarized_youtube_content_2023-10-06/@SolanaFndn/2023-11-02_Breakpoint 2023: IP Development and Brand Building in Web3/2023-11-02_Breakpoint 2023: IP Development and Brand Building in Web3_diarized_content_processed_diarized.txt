00:00:02.840 - 00:00:27.194, Speaker A: My name is Tiffany. I work on the Solana foundation, primarily focusing on games, media, and entertainment. My background, I joined from Polygon, and I got started in web3 through games, through a studio called Dustbreakers. But love to welcome everyone on this panel. So let's just go down the line. I'll start off with Tariq, so feel free to introduce yourself.
00:00:27.554 - 00:01:06.274, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. Tariq here, aka boring dad. The boring part is supposed to be sarcastic, but I've been partying so hard, like, for the last few days that I can make absolutely no guarantees about today. So forgive me in advance. I've been in crypto since 2016, margin trading a lot. I was a pretty big dgen for a while. I was an investor and an advisor to Voyager, which is a pretty big crypto broker that went down with the whole, like, FTX three, AC, Luna Celsius.
00:01:06.274 - 00:01:36.024, Speaker B: So don't hate me. I have nothing to do with that. My background is actually, like, creative. I've been working in the creative field for 20 years before some of you were born, probably writer director, worked mainly in film and animation, and basically started a game studio in 2018 called Vitel XP. And we've been working on this game called Low Life Forms. Is that right, intro wise? Time wise, yeah. All right.
00:01:36.064 - 00:01:37.808, Speaker A: It's a great intro. All right.
00:01:37.936 - 00:01:58.348, Speaker C: Damn, that's impressive. Okay, so I'm Peter, and I'm creative director at Trailblazer Games. My background is mostly from the web. Two side of things. I kind of came into this through Trailblazer games, actually. Background started in AAA at Crytek, first person shooters. Just a gamer at heart.
00:01:58.348 - 00:02:21.552, Speaker C: Basically made my way into Facebook gaming, and from there into mobile gaming and various creative services to different game companies. And now here I am in the wonderful world of web3 and having a blast. It's been a pretty crazy ride, but it's been awesome. Yeah, love it. Every minute of it. Minute of it. Yeah.
00:02:21.608 - 00:02:52.874, Speaker D: And I'm employs. I'm one of the co founders of reverse. My background, primarily from web two, stems from I've been a creative director mostly in fashion, and then hopped off to tech. Worked as a CEO for a bunch of years. Started off my crypto journey as a simple deacon, aping in for literally the apes of the NFTs. Started off working with reverse with my colleague Mape, who's in the audience today as well. Been grinding on it for a year, and we launched it late September, and it's been a hell of a ride.
00:02:52.874 - 00:02:54.374, Speaker D: Like the hurricane outside, man.
00:02:55.834 - 00:03:28.314, Speaker A: Thank you guys for the wonderful introductions and all of you guys have very interesting creative backgrounds which I want to touch upon later today. But just want to kick us off today a little bit focused on kind of the NFT launches that you guys have all had. So Peter, I know last year Trailblazer did a very interesting NFT launch where you guys didn't mint out the entire collection, but did it in weeks. So love to hear kind of that experience and maybe some learnings there.
00:03:29.134 - 00:04:27.680, Speaker C: Yeah, that was, yeah, last year. It's like a lifetime ago in this space. We minted a thousand. We launched 1000 nfts every week for ten weeks to create the full collection. The rationale behind this is that we wanted to actually introduce every single week and focus it around a particular class of the dragons in our case, which are the kind of the core fundamental building block for the IAP that we have. It allowed us to, week on week, gradually introduce facets and aspects of the law while gaining live feedback and kind of a degree of space to react to what they, our users, were telling us as well as gradually introduce concepts for the game as well. So week by week, almost chapter by chapter, it fostered a really strong and overwhelmingly positive response actually from our user base.
00:04:27.680 - 00:04:45.264, Speaker C: And we sort of created some phenomenal ties that we still have to this day. Basically kicked it off with Edcon in Berlin at the end of that successful mint. And that was amazing. Yeah, it's been awesome.
00:04:45.684 - 00:04:57.580, Speaker A: Yeah, lovely. Tariq? I know you guys also did a mint fairly earlier this year, so walk us through kind of the logistics. How did it work? Were you guys happy with it?
00:04:57.772 - 00:05:57.048, Speaker B: Tarik well, we chose pretty much like the worst week, I think, of the year to mint. Not really proud of that. But the mint went well. We sold out pretty fast. It was like a small, almost like confidential mint because it was like 1111 units. But we were really looking at it like a testing ground, like a sample where we could grow the community of hardcore OG like web3 gamers, I see a few here and I think what we really realized that for a game that has the time of development like we do, where we haven't launched yet, the game isn't live and we've been working at it for three years and there's still a few months basically before the launch, there was no point going too hard, too fast on the NFT side. Now we're growing the OG community.
00:05:57.048 - 00:06:17.016, Speaker B: We have about 17 to 18 collections that are planned over the next two years. Some of them are already fully designed. We're just timing it to correspond to the right milestones of the game development. So that's basically what's been going on there.
00:06:17.080 - 00:06:27.694, Speaker A: Love to dive a little bit deeper into the game later as well. Employees, I know you guys also reversed, I guess, pretty recent NFT drop earlier, two months ago.
00:06:28.794 - 00:07:33.704, Speaker D: I think it was 19 September. It was official, like international talk, like a pirate day. So we thought it was a fitting day to launch. But yeah, so we launched at that time. We had to kind of find a good balance of when we launched, when the interest was still hot, but also when we felt ready to launch with the game and felt that people, people also had a decent understanding of what the game was and what our goal is with it and how to play it because we wanted to essentially attract those that were interested in actually playing the game and not just flipping the NFT. And then we would have had to kind of redo the entire marketing again to attract those gamers. So finding the balance between people that were interested in the project and the NFT side of it, kind of use them in a sense in terms of pushing the narrative and the lore and the marketing and the brand of side of the project to attract those that would be interested in playing the game but doesn't necessarily read and have that trickle down into what we have today.
00:07:33.704 - 00:08:39.800, Speaker D: And I think the launch went, at least in my opinion, better than I expected. The pre sale went flying too fast, unfortunately. It was fortunate, but it was definitely faster than I would have preferred because it kind of put a couple of pressure points on us. But it was also like it challenged you. And you just have to navigate through that space and find what works and what gives you the reaction, but also gives you the ability to try out how to bring that patience of the people, the potential holders that are going to be holders, essentially, where you will need to have the patience with them, essentially, while building the community project long term, finding the way where they bought a presale quickly and early, like two months before we actually launched and still have that interest kept high and how we take that with us today in terms of just now with the Solana pumping, NFT prices dropping, how do we still keep that interest going forward?
00:08:39.992 - 00:08:47.905, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. I remember seeing on Twitter that your, I guess, website game got attacked or.
00:08:48.009 - 00:09:20.664, Speaker D: Yeah, so we had an exploit like four minutes into launching the thing. I was kind of expecting it. So as soon as I saw a blimp on the radar, I think I told the lads who were sitting there like, just shut the withdrawal down. Unfortunately took longer than we were hoping to fix it. It took around ten days ish to patch things up. But that also, I mean, you can look at it in multiple ways. I think what the positive I can take from there is that people kind of build a trust in us as founders because they saw that we were there.
00:09:20.664 - 00:09:54.954, Speaker D: They saw that we were called and collected and were there talking and understanding with the community and not just necessarily defensive or hiding and trying to fix things in the shadows. And I think that helped a lot because, I mean, it gave us definitely a quick chance to just prove ourselves as creators in this space. But yeah, it was mentally tough. It was 22 hours of just grinding a day and then having people yell in your ear, concerned. And I mean, I understand it. People are afraid, people have had horrible experiences, but just kind of showing that we got this and we will move forward. And essentially people have forgotten about it today.
00:09:54.954 - 00:10:07.534, Speaker D: And I think it shows in terms of how to manage and also not just manage the community, because essentially it's also building the brand of it. It's setting the stone of what we, the foundation we want to do with the project.
00:10:08.204 - 00:10:13.156, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. And also you live and you learn. And hopefully this is like a blessing in disguise.
00:10:13.260 - 00:10:14.316, Speaker D: It is what it is.
00:10:14.460 - 00:10:31.624, Speaker A: It is what it is. It's part of the space, definitely. Peter, I want to get to know a little bit more about the iP, eternal dragons, the gameplay, what you guys have planned coming up in the next three months to 2024?
00:10:34.294 - 00:10:53.854, Speaker C: Well, we're currently. I mean, we've launched, we're live. So that's news there. The game is out. We're out in test markets right now. Kind of adapting, I guess, like a pretty standard process for agile development in a typical sort of web two game space. It's an auto, auto battler, sort of auto chess.
00:10:53.854 - 00:11:45.376, Speaker C: If people know about that and you. It's been, I think the thing that's been the most interesting and challenging, I think, from my side of things involved in the project has been to come into project where normally in a game dev situation you have your pre production, where you develop the IP. When I arrived, the IP was essentially established. We have these immutable assets that now are there forever. And working around that and understanding how that changes and shifts my relationship to the creative process has been a really interesting one. I think what it led to was this concept of law markers where we basically, our NFT collection is an immutable set of assets. But we also know that we're going to lens them in different ways through different products.
00:11:45.376 - 00:12:23.306, Speaker C: And in a way, the NFTs are not the end product. They are sort of a filter through which you can experience multiple products differently down the line. And some of the challenges there is also you have the people who own nfTs. And at the beginning the idea is like, oh, well, I own the NFT, so I own the product. And this is the thing. And actually we have to sort of work a lot on our narrative and how we relate, communicate with our audience to actually explain to them that, look, it's in your best interest and it's in our best interest. We're not necessarily making this so that we can make, I don't know, whatever it is out of the nfts.
00:12:23.306 - 00:12:46.364, Speaker C: It's actually because we want to build an ecosystem which will bring in a massive audience from outside of the space into the web3 ecosystem and leverage this kind of brand new technology and awesome potential and possibilities around asset ownership in a digital environment. I don't know if that answered your question, but that's great.
00:12:46.864 - 00:12:50.576, Speaker A: I also recently checked out the game as well, and I think it's on mobile.
00:12:50.680 - 00:13:15.886, Speaker C: Yes, that's right. Yeah, we're live on Android. You can go to eternal dragons.com and get the Apk or the test flight builds. It's every two weeks we push an update. We have a league system going on. There's already kind of the possibility to earn and gain immutable assets that will be, well, more on that later.
00:13:15.886 - 00:13:17.654, Speaker C: But yeah, it's exciting times.
00:13:17.814 - 00:13:33.234, Speaker A: Yeah. And then, tarik, I really want to better understand where you want to take the vital XP, the IP forward and how you envision kind of where your assets will exist and how you want to develop this as a brand.
00:13:33.934 - 00:14:26.262, Speaker B: So I'll step back a little bit on that one, like, for people to understand a little bit, like how we came up with the IP because I think that is quite important and on topic. So I started writing low life forms like about eight or nine years ago, right? And it was originally for an animated series. And the idea was like relatively simple. It was the intersection between science, fantasy on one side and the underground criminal world on the other. And I think like when we talk about IP development and in particular entertainment IP development, which is really what we're talking about here, first things first, right? What's the territory? You know, like how would you like one line it? How do you define it? And for me, you know, I was always looking at like Sci-Fi and we were writing a lot of things. It was part of this like writers group. Some of my writers group actually now working on the next GTA to give you context.
00:14:26.262 - 00:14:59.578, Speaker B: And essentially, like, each time I was seeing, say, you know, crime and Sci-Fi together, it was always cyberpunk. And I was like, I want to do something a little bit different, right? So I was looking at, say, science fantasy, like, more generally. And you think about, like, star wars and you think about for the geeks in the, in the room, episode four, and you're on Tatooine and you're in mosaic, and that's the best moment, right? Han Solo is there. Guys try to fuck him up. He works for Jabba smugglers. This and that. I'm like, okay, let's capture this moment and let's build an ip.
00:14:59.578 - 00:15:28.330, Speaker B: Just about that moment. It's really important. And then your name, your graphic identity, everything comes from that. That is what is building an iPad for entertainment is about. So low life forms says a lot of different things, right? Because you have the alien life forms, right? That gives you, like, the Sci-Fi side, and then you have lowlife. That gives you the gangster side, but it says also something else. It says, like, it's tongue in cheek.
00:15:28.330 - 00:15:57.038, Speaker B: We're not going to take ourselves seriously. We're going to take the piss, right? Like, so that we sang a lot with just that. Then you look at the graphic identity and we try to build something that has, like, a signature look, right? Everybody's gone to vaporware stuff. So we try to do something a little bit different. We do, like, retro futuristic. So the color palette is coming from there. Every piece of design, every piece of ux and ui in the game, outside the game, everything comes from there.
00:15:57.038 - 00:16:41.220, Speaker B: I think, like, you know, if I had to give advice, because I've been building worlds for, like, 20 years now, right? Like, to anyone that wants to start a project and is thinking about really, like, building a world, you have to start at the very beginning. Are you able to define your territory in one sentence? And is everything consistent across the board? This is not specific to web3. So how do you integrate them? Like nfts. So for us, and I think that's very specific to games, because games are a different kind of entertainment product. It has to do with the game design. So the low lives that are out there, collection, generation zero, they are playable characters. A playable character is not like any kind of character.
00:16:41.220 - 00:17:11.782, Speaker B: A playable character for a game like ours, which is a shooter, they need to be able to handle, like a one hand gun, a two hand, like rifle. They need to be able to throw grenades, slide, crouch, ads, blah, blah, blah. You know, there's all of these things so all of our characters are already like rigged animated. And we did like a very, very complex collection, almost as like a test. It was actually the first collection in the world to be based on ue five metahumans. Parallel did that like a few months ago. We did it a year before them.
00:17:11.782 - 00:17:23.646, Speaker B: We really closed with Epic and we were testing a lot of technology with them, but all the other collections are basically tied to the game design, so I'm not going to go too deep on this. Right.
00:17:23.710 - 00:17:27.406, Speaker A: But there's a lot of history and lore behind it.
00:17:27.430 - 00:17:55.774, Speaker B: I know there's a lot of storytelling because we've been at it for like eight years, which is. Is crazy. Even before, like, you know, we pivoted to a web3 game. I actually don't remember your question at all. So I'm just like talking about the thing, but I could give like a TED talk about thing. One thing I'd say is that our CTO is the guy who actually built the engine for Call of Duty. Usually that's the mic drop, but I cannot drop the headset.
00:17:55.774 - 00:17:58.174, Speaker B: I'll just move on, please.
00:17:59.394 - 00:18:28.656, Speaker A: Thank you for the answer. I really like the IP and lore. We've went into your office, playtested the game, saw the worlds and different game modes, and it's very impressive. And eight years in the making, which is crazy. Thank you, employees. I want to better understand the reaver's ip and also, what does the game look like right now and how do you envision the game to. To kind of expand as we kind of go on as well?
00:18:28.720 - 00:19:19.588, Speaker D: Yeah, so, I mean, essentially, Reavis in its core is a staking, idle game. And we've seen a couple of those, especially recent time with the meta popping up. And I think the important thing is to, especially as an investor or as a holder or a mentor, you have to kind of see what separates each one of them and what makes them unique and what is the co foundation of their. Their vision, essentially. And what me and my team have been kind of talking, essentially, since we started looking at this, is that our primary goal is to try and make it immersive constantly along the way. And the way the game is designed is that it allows us to fluently, kind of not adjust, because that's how people see it. They see the things that might be done as an adjustment to the reaction.
00:19:19.588 - 00:19:43.634, Speaker D: But a lot of the things are kind of, by design, built that way where we are allowed to push or pull the handbrake when needed based on the progression of the players. And in itself, right now, the first chapter consists of three islands where the players progress through. Island two came out on Monday. Start of breakpoint and people.
00:19:43.714 - 00:19:45.178, Speaker A: Is it breakpoint themed?
00:19:45.346 - 00:19:45.810, Speaker D: Sorry?
00:19:45.882 - 00:19:47.426, Speaker A: Is it breakpoint themed?
00:19:47.610 - 00:19:48.412, Speaker D: If it's what?
00:19:48.498 - 00:19:49.848, Speaker A: Is it breakpoint themed?
00:19:49.976 - 00:20:46.504, Speaker D: No, it's plunder themed. But yeah, kind of. No, but. So island two came out and it's quite fascinating to see the reaction between holders of those that have been playing the game as it's intended, leveled up and progressed, and kind of set their strategy early on because that was also something that we believed were very important where we allow players to kind of design their gameplay because some people have a lot of time, some people have few times, hours per day to spend on the game. But also kind of the beauty of doing your own strategy and sharing it with the community and kind of sharing the tips and tricks between each other where it's not a one size fits all. And now with the island two stepping out, you kind of see how those who have played it a little bit slower and kind of not necessarily understood that leveling up is the meta with our game are catching up and are seeing how those that have progressed a lot harder and have gone to island too. How much a lot more they earn.
00:20:46.504 - 00:22:01.828, Speaker D: But also for us, the long term vision essentially is just how can we make every aspect of the game immersive and try to push the needle step by step. One thing that we're doing now is we're building an in game marketplace powered by an actual player in this space by sniper. And they're providing incredibly fast APIs. And what that does allows us is that we end up keeping the player inside of the game where they can trade their NFTs still on the marketplaces they prefer because we allow them to pick and choose whatever marketplace they want, but we don't require them to leave the game and break that ux flow. And even one challenge we met along the way was how do we break the flow where people have to withdraw the game, sorry, the NFT from the game to unfreeze it in order to list it. And just figuring out that flow in one click where they can list their NFT that's in the wallet and it just streamlined unfreezes and lists and go in the game as well as reverse order where you buy and automatically be able to send it on the game. So things like that is, I mean, a lot of people ask, why are you guys doing it? Why are you putting resources? Is it important? I mean, I can just send people to magic, eat and sniper.
00:22:01.828 - 00:23:21.898, Speaker D: Tensorflow I think for us in the core team, the reason we're doing this is to build cool shit and hopefully be able to push this space a little bit step by step, and find ways to collaborate with other creators in this space, other builders, other developers, and bring the forces together and share ideas and make each IP strong. In a sense, that's what I love just going into the challenge of the marketplace. It allowed us to figure out a lot of problems that are in gaming. And Solana specifically, like, haven't been necessarily catered to or paid attention to or even given any thought and care. But it also allowed the marketplaces, because we noticed that, okay, one thing that's happening with NFT, where NFTs used to be very static in their metadata, now they're kind of changing constantly, especially with us, with the level up and the island eligibility and stuff like that, the metadata is updating constantly. And how do the marketplaces keep up in order to provide the accurate stats? And I think just me nagging on every marketplace allowed them to kind of improve on their aspects on their sides. And I think just coming together and pushing each other will help figure out how to, as Peter said, bring in a lot of new people.
00:23:21.898 - 00:24:08.330, Speaker D: Because from my point of view, the biggest challenge we have is that we're finding for the same people, instead of trying to solve, how do we get more people in? Because that's essentially what we want. We want more users in Solana. We want more traders in Solana because that's how we're all going to win in the end. So that's, I mean, for us, especially with the game, the way it's built. And my primary challenge, and that comes very into the topic of brand building, is how do we get people to understand what we're trying to do? And that's the most challenging thing, because you have the whales that read, and they're whales for a reason, because they read, they do the diluted sets and they do the strategies, and you have the shrimps that just think about the 0.1 salon of profit, and they panic when things dump. And if they.
00:24:08.330 - 00:24:51.244, Speaker D: For example, in our case, if they leveled up, they would have earned more and the ROI would shrink tons in time. So how do we, with Ux and proper gameplay guides, like, guide them through the game where they understand that this is the next steps you need to take? Like, if you're stuck, this is what you need to do. And I think we're doing it step by step. It's adapting, adjusting, and trying to, trying to move on. And keep calm. Essentially. People will always have concerns when Solana pumps and NFT prices dumps, but I think it's just keeping it calm and collected and kind of believing in what you're building and keep pushing the narrative and the lore that, especially from our side that we have, I think people slowly get it and slowly see it and it trickles down, essentially.
00:24:51.404 - 00:25:30.034, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely agree. And I'm a huge fan of the kind of gameplay and idle staking games that are now on Solana as well. It's a new esque djen way of playing games and exploring kind of what Solana has to offer. I want to shift gears a little bit. I know all of us here on stage have had some history of doing something in web two, too. Curious of your thoughts on how web3 has enabled another side of IP brand building and ways that it's helpful or maybe ways that it's not as helpful, I guess. Popcorn to Peter first.
00:25:30.974 - 00:25:35.274, Speaker C: Damn good question.
00:25:36.814 - 00:25:43.684, Speaker A: How has web3 helped develop with your AP and building a brand?
00:25:46.984 - 00:26:40.696, Speaker C: I think where it's been really interesting is in the community side of things and the amount of connection that we have at a very early stage with the people who are basically involved with us from the very get go. That's probably one of the biggest, biggest spaces. I think it's also been interesting to see that there's so much passion on the kind of like the ground floor. Like everybody kind of brings this energy and sometimes, maybe not always good energy, but there's a lot of good energy to be had, right. Like coming in and people want something that we're making to succeed, so they'll give a lot of their energy into it. And you really, you build strong community. I think that would be one of the biggest standout things that I can think of right off top of my head.
00:26:40.696 - 00:26:44.444, Speaker C: Probably think of something really good as soon as you start speaking. But yeah, I'll throw it over.
00:26:45.824 - 00:27:52.434, Speaker B: I mean, clearly community is the number one, I think, factor in terms of web3. I would say together with it, you have incentivization, which is kind of the same thing for Web 3d gens. I think in general it's double edged though, right? Because you need to keep the community like happy, which means like, numbers goes up, you know, and it also means like always, always releasing stuff, which I think for, you know, entertainment like products such as games is not always easy because we have like development times that are like relatively like long. And sometimes it's a little bit difficult to keep like communicating all the time. It's a little bit like having a really, really demanding girlfriend or boyfriend. I guess it's literally, I think it's the best parallel. But the other part of the web3, web two thing that's quite interesting, I think, is that a lot of people wonder about crossover, oh, kind of big traditional brand crossover to web3.
00:27:52.434 - 00:28:57.530, Speaker B: I'd say if you look at, at least since I've been in the space, so like seven years, like the answer is kind of like no traditional brands, pre existing brands, existing ips, what we call them, right? They haven't been very successful. Even big powerful ones. Like Marvel comes, like Porsche comes, nothing happens. I think the big winners in terms of web3 ips are going to be native ips. Ips that have been like built, written thought for this community, right? And I think, like, that's one of the things that we're trying to feel as far as a gap with low light forms is that you have on one end like DJ's that are building games on the other end, you have like big studios trying to build like web3 games, but with no, like, connection with like the culture, like the DJ and culture. And we're trying to do that like aaaa ish game with like a long development, like cycle. But from people who actually been in that world, you know, I know what it is.
00:28:57.530 - 00:29:32.238, Speaker B: Like, I know the pain of like, you know, losing all my money, you know, at night and not being able to look at my kids in the eyes. No, I'm kidding. But like, you know, I know what it is. Like, it's pretty fun. And when you have, like, lived that shit, like, it totally transforms your vision. So the jokes are different, you know, like, I'll go back to an ip thing again because I tried to be as didactic as possible for people who want to be inspired building stuff. So for me, when I was talking about the Sci-Fi meets underground, so there was an image in my head, very simple.
00:29:32.238 - 00:30:01.688, Speaker B: I could visualize it. It was basically an alien with russian prison tattoos. I could see it. And that's how I built the lowlife. And they were kind of inspired also by part of my life, which I won't talk about on this stage, but, you know, don't dm me either, but talk to me when I'm a little bit drunk, I'll tell you a little bit about it and it's half a secret. But also that's another thing. And I'll stop there also because I'm going to go on tangents.
00:30:01.688 - 00:30:53.994, Speaker B: Like, if you're going to build like, an IP, write something. Write about something, you know, and you understand. You know, it's like any kind of like, startup, right? People like sometimes, oh, this great idea. Yeah, but why you, if the idea has nothing to do with your skill set, nothing to do with your experience, nothing to do with your personality, you know, like, it's, you know, when I speak with, like, Nick, right, from Kleinosaurs, like, I could, like, he embodies like, kleinosaur is a chill guy. He's nice and everything, you know, low life is me, you know, it's about like, fucked up DJ's, you know, so I'm building something that correspond to, you know, what I know. So how I relate that to the original question is that I think that's why, like, the big winners of the big ips that are going to be web3 are going to be native.
00:30:54.774 - 00:31:33.632, Speaker A: That's very interesting. I feel like, you know, when we talk, all three of us in conversations, like, there's a lot of these AAA game studios or large major brands coming into web3, but most of the time you don't see them do a lot on chain or just very minimal things. So it's very interesting that you bring up a lot of the IP that you think will succeed are very web3 native IP. And probably that's because they understand the audience, they understand who they're building this for. But, yeah, I think that's super interesting. And employees, I also do want to give you the chance to answer the question as well.
00:31:33.728 - 00:32:11.874, Speaker D: I mean, I'm gonna catch up on these guys because the community side of it is definitely what I mean, you can have an ip in your head, but if nobody believes in it or listening, it's not gonna matter. So the community side definitely helps. And I think, like you said, tariq, just especially building a game. I was talking to a fellow developer the other day and I was like, I don't think people realize how long and how tough it is to build things. Like, you can be a good coder, but you also have to be a good ux designer. You have to be a good, like, it takes a lot of effort to actually build the smallest things. And building a game, it takes time and it takes effort and takes a lot of thinking.
00:32:11.874 - 00:33:01.330, Speaker D: Especially with our case, that is an idle thinking game. Like, our tokenomics is our heart in the project, and we can't just shit out anything that anybody suggests in the community because we have to do the math. We have to evaluate, we have to evaluate the resource it takes to build it. Versus the value it's going to give. And I don't think people also realize if I take time to build this, then this will not be built and just sticking through with your ip and also again, try to push the narrative and push essentially the culture. Because in comparison to web two, I told it to one of my friends the other day because we were standing in line and I was standing for a calls release and he was like, why are we standing in line? I was like, dude, this is web two, NFT. Like, this is hype.
00:33:01.330 - 00:33:45.960, Speaker D: I'm going to resell this for ten x tomorrow. And just having that culture where you kind of resonate with an NFT or a project or a community. And as a founder, I think the biggest challenge we have is to, and I was talking to you about it in the lounge, is to find the balance where you give the community what they need in terms of transparency, in terms of the vibes and the marketing and the communication and just having them feel heard. But also extremely important to allow yourself to build in peace. Because as soon as you build with the community, that's when you lose focus on what you're building. And as soon as you build in silence, then you're going to lose the community. So I think having the balance is, is extremely important.
00:33:45.960 - 00:34:24.479, Speaker D: It's extremely challenging because web3 is in massively fast paced environment. Like in web two, I can do eight to five and if you want something dm me on LinkedIn, I might answer. And it's just, that's just the way it is. And I think the community side is so small that people have a direct link to you as a founder or a builder or whatever you do in the community and they have a voice. And I think you mentioned it, Tariq, like, or if it was you, like, you buy an NFT and you essentially buy the entire project. And I'd be like, sure, I would love to see it. But it also doesn't give the right to dictate how the project is built.
00:34:24.479 - 00:35:43.184, Speaker D: Like, you bought it essentially as an investor with the belief and trust in what we're building. And having that type of communication in your brand building is extremely important, where you allow yourself to actually build what you're supposed to build, what they actually invested in to begin with, and finding that tonality and the type of voice with the community so that they trust it and they believe it with you. And they see the long term vision and not the short term small pump of NFT price and also be able to, because like you mentioned Klanosaurs and one thing I love about Klanosaurs and a couple of other projects there, that their strongest ip is the voices of the community because they massively believe in the, in the projects and the communities and the brand and they resonate with it and they just want everybody else to see it and come in and vibe with it. And I think Max said it early on in his speech. Like, just posting about your newly bought NFT and get rated with 100 Twitter pings, like, that's just, it's the beauty of it. And if you use it properly to your advantage to push the ip and the narrative of the brand, I think that's when you win. But as soon as you lose focus of what you actually are supposed to build, that's when it all falls apart.
00:35:43.344 - 00:36:40.224, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's very true in terms of the community aspect. Because in web two game development, I myself as a player, will one day never talk to a game developer or the CEO or the founder of this game project. In web3, you're kind of building together with, you know, the co founders and the game directors, right? You're able to ping them on Discord, you're able to find them on Twitter and kind of message them, whether that's good or bad. But that availability is there as a community member. And I think that really empowers how you want to build your brand and company and game. Shifting gears a little bit. I know all three of you guys are building games right now, but very curious down the line, will there be any other developments? I know you mentioned lowlife was initially started out as a tv animation series.
00:36:40.224 - 00:36:45.824, Speaker A: Curious if there's any other plans down the line or the roadmap for you guys.
00:36:46.564 - 00:37:29.928, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, yes, I think when you're building an ip and there's a trend, we've seen crossovers from games to tv and streaming. It used to be, like, usually not that successful, but the last of us obviously, you know, like that, that was like a massively good example going back to Star wars. You know, like, they really started the whole, like, merch coming from, like, the ips. So I think, like, generally speaking, the North Star, right? Like, when you build, like, such ips to be able, like, to cross over, cross media and also, like, through. So for us, like, that's definitely the plan. We have a five year plan for, like, the game. The game is episodic.
00:37:29.928 - 00:37:41.336, Speaker B: So already, like, that's like pretty, pretty big. But when the time is right, we're also going to be like, spinning off, you know, like for an animated series and launching like some serious merch and.
00:37:41.360 - 00:37:43.444, Speaker A: Merch with the russian tattoos.
00:37:45.264 - 00:37:46.312, Speaker B: Pretty much.
00:37:46.488 - 00:37:50.752, Speaker A: Peter, are we going to be seeing plushies or dragons?
00:37:50.848 - 00:38:27.548, Speaker C: I don't know about plushies. Maybe anything's possible. No, we have an ecosystem of games kind of in the works right now, in the back rooms, so to speak. Our biggest objective right now, I think, though, as a company has become to mainstreamify the technological advantages of web3. And there's a weird analogy which I don't know if it's going to hold up so well in my head it works, I'll try it out. Basically, I think this has happened before. If some of us who are a little older remember the advent of Napster, when that came on the scene, changed the relationship to how people saw music.
00:38:27.548 - 00:38:48.304, Speaker C: And then suddenly you thought like, oh yeah, music should have it easy. Fraught with problems. It was difficult, a difficult space to navigate. There was a passionate community that was behind it. Similar parallels are happening. Flash forward to the future. You have Spotify comes on the scene essentially delivering the same serviceability.
00:38:48.304 - 00:39:25.362, Speaker C: You get what you want instantly, but in a format that can be adopted by the masses without jurisdictional issues. And that's when it really took off and it just changed the entire ecosystem. So we think that the digital ownership aspect, the identity aspect, the interoperability kind of component is the key, or one of the keys, let's say, behind web3 technology. And that's something that we, through the ecosystem of games and products that we're going to be building and partnering with, are hell bent on bringing to the, to the wide world of web two or web3 or all of it.
00:39:25.378 - 00:39:27.322, Speaker A: Really super exciting.
00:39:27.418 - 00:39:28.094, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:28.874 - 00:39:29.986, Speaker A: Poise are we?
00:39:30.090 - 00:40:52.672, Speaker D: Oh, I would love to have a plushie, man. I love the Kleinosaurs plushies when I saw them. But yeah, I mean, essentially for us, the main target right now is just continue building the game and continue making it as immersive as possible and with as much partnerships as we potentially can do together with other builders and other strong providers of tools and cool things. Because by the end of the day, we're just huge nerds, want to build like dope things for the space. And I think that was like the first things I said when we came out with the project and I was talking in space, is like the one thing I want to primarily just try to break is how do we have people come together for sole goal, essentially. So one of the things we're looking at is how can we have people play together? Can we do team ups? Can we do battles where potentially projects can create their own clans and go together and just kind of push their project inside of our game. And can we add different providers of tool where they would, where it helps contributes with the use of the NFT, where it makes it more usable and more immersive and gives the player essentially the web two experience they might be used to in games? Because I mean, I think the possibilities are definitely there and I think we all know the abilities to build in Solana is amazing and there's limitless possibilities.
00:40:52.672 - 00:41:13.234, Speaker D: It's just about figuring out how do we do it and how do we do it together with others to just kind of strengthen each other and not just that, speed things up and push the needle little by little as well. But yeah, I mean, we're going to focus on building the game and making the cool shit that I have in plans. That's all we can do for now.
00:41:13.354 - 00:41:33.208, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I'm looking forward to it. And as we wrap up for this panel, one last question. If you give any advice for someone who's trying to build an IP game brand and web3, what would it be? I'll, I guess, put you on the spot, in place.
00:41:33.336 - 00:42:15.174, Speaker D: I mean, I think if it was to you, I told it. Like, for me, the only advice I can tell people, like, if you want to build something, try. I think people are either too scared to try or to explore or to ask. Like, there's extremely smart people in this space, connect with them and ask for help. And I think a lot of people will be amazed in terms of how many are willing to just share knowledge. And for me, that's how I progressed in this space when I started off as a degenerate and lost money during the night. But just connecting with people and getting knowledge and go about it and not being afraid of trying, at least I think that's the only thing I can say.
00:42:15.174 - 00:42:17.674, Speaker D: Century, totally.
00:42:17.794 - 00:42:18.962, Speaker C: And have fun doing it.
00:42:19.058 - 00:42:21.934, Speaker D: That's really it. Don't lose money.
00:42:22.634 - 00:42:38.194, Speaker A: It's like a rite of passage. You lose money and then hopefully, I don't know, one day you'll end up here on stage. But yeah. Thank you guys for hopping on the panel with me. Love the conversation about IP development and brand building and web3. So thanks.
