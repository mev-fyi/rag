00:00:12.560 - 00:00:49.228, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Hope everyone had a good lunch. We have a really exciting panel. We're going to be talking everything kind of cross chain, I think, you know, it's pretty obvious now to me that we're living in a multi chain world, which has been great. There's been all these ecosystems popping up across l one s and l two s. But how do all these things connect? And how do the downstream ux, how does that work as well? So we're going to be discussing all of that. But first, before we dig into things, it'd be great if you guys could just introduce yourself, tell us a little about your project as well.
00:00:49.356 - 00:01:04.052, Speaker B: Sure. Hey, everybody. So my name is Chris Hart. I'm the CEO at Civic. Civic has been in the blockchain identity space since 2016. So we're kind of ogs. We've been around for a little while.
00:01:04.052 - 00:01:53.854, Speaker B: We've worked with blockchain companies, we've worked with non blockchain companies and actually think this is a really exciting time because what we're hearing from projects unlike what we had heard previously over the last couple of years is identity is becoming really, really important. Whether that's for DeFi, whether that's for nfTs, it's becoming really essential and it's something that they need and they want inside their project. So for us, that's really cool, because what we've built basically is an identity Lego that you can pull off the shelf. It's fully composable, it works cross chain. And in 2018, we launched our sister company, Identity.com. And Identity.com is a nonprofit and they have something called the identity Gatekeeper protocol.
00:01:53.854 - 00:02:32.276, Speaker B: And basically our identity token lives on that identity gatekeeper protocol. And we basically provide identity. And I think it's important just to say identity doesn't always mean KYC. It can actually mean other things. It can mean fully anonymous, as in the case of ignite, which we launched on Solana on Monday, which is for NFT mints and drops. It can mean pseudo anonymous, like we're doing for NFT creators who want to be instilling trust in their community, but they want to be semi anonymous. Or it could be full KYC, like Solarise Dex Pro, that awesome team.
00:02:32.276 - 00:02:56.564, Speaker B: Or we've got snow Crash, which is an NFT platform based on metaplex launching on Solana. You're going to hear a lot about that project, I think, soon. So we're really fired up about like the cross chain identity. It needs to be elevated up beyond one chain, but we're doing it all on Solana, because it's fast, cheap, and the time to finality is really good. So that's us.
00:02:57.064 - 00:03:39.990, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, I'm Gabe Cohen. I work at three box labs, which builds out a product called the ceramic network. And the idea is that we have mutable data on decentralized storage. So you can bring your own blockchain and bring your own decentralized storage. Ipfs, arweave anything else and have high integrity data that can change over time. Think about dynamic NFTs or any data that you want to associate with your decentralized applications. And we're really trying to realize the power of decentralized identity, putting users in control of all of their data, independent of any centralized institution or even any centralized storage solution or blockchain itself.
00:03:39.990 - 00:03:42.514, Speaker C: So free your data on ceramic.
00:03:44.254 - 00:04:23.950, Speaker D: Hey everyone, Simon Harmgart here. I'm from Parsec in IQ labs. So we've been around since 2019 with Parsec, and what Parsec is all about is about making it really easy to access data happening on chain in real time. So it's all about streaming data. So whatever data you want to monitor, Parsec has its own programming language that's super easy to use, called ParsecqL. And if you want to monitor custom event within your smart contract or internal external function calls, we can detect that in real time. And then you can send notifications to users, telegram, discord, or alert an endpoint by leveraging web hooks.
00:04:23.950 - 00:04:58.226, Speaker D: Or even if you wanted to integrate email, you could go ahead and send an email again in real time by just detecting that event on chain. So Parsec started off with streaming, and now we're moving again into historical data soon as well. We're cross chain ETH, BSC Solana. We're heavily invested in Solana. We really believe in the future of Solana. So that's all about Parsec. And then we launched a new protocol that's called iQ protocol, and it's all about making it really simple for users to build their tokenomics.
00:04:58.226 - 00:05:46.854, Speaker D: And what we noticed is that the incentives of all users aren't always aligned in protocols. So you're going to have users who just want to hold the token, might not want to use it for whatever utility it has, but then you're going to have users who actually just want to access the service, not be exposed to the price fluctuations of that native token. So what this protocol allows is to actually rent wrapped, expirable versions of that original token from lenders. And everyone wins at the end of the day, because people who want to access the utility can pay, like a monthly fee or an annual fee, like, if it's a subscription, in order to access whatever it is. And the fees they pay go back to the lenders in the form of interest. So, yeah, that's all about iqlabs. And we're also doing collateralist renting of nfTs.
00:05:46.854 - 00:05:58.814, Speaker D: So you can think of, like, in game content, being able to rent these versions of the NFTs in order to access whatever utility they have in a game or other application.
00:06:00.074 - 00:06:32.458, Speaker A: Great. Thanks, guys. So one common theme, I think, is between some of your projects is the notion of identity and its importance. And honestly, when I've used crypto protocols, I'm just using my address associated with my wallet to interact with these things. I don't necessarily think of that as my whole identity. So I'm curious, like, how do your projects kind of expand on that notion of identity and including more data to be able to utilize in a lot of the Dapps that we see today? So, Chris, do you want to start?
00:06:32.586 - 00:07:20.724, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a great question. And there's this notion of identity that is kind of baked into blockchain today, which is my wallet is my identity. Why do I need anything beyond my wallet? I've got my private key, I've got my 24 word seed phrase. But I think the problem comes in when you try and do things where you need multiple wallets. And I think all of the guidance suggests when you're doing purchases, you should use a burner wallet, and then you should put it to your other wallet. And then what if you want to get an ethereum NFt? Or what if you want to do something on Casper or Polkadot or whatever? Pretty soon you end up with 510, 15 wallets, maybe more. And also, the wallet doesn't actually express anything about your identity as a person.
00:07:20.724 - 00:08:24.060, Speaker B: Right. So there needs to be an abstraction layer above the wallet that basically rests, we think, on a did or a decentralized identity standard that's also on chain. We think it's really important that identity live on chain in a fully decentralized way and that it's not sort of siloed away into a database, but it's actually readable on chain because it allows other Dapps, other protocols to actually access that information. So the way we're thinking about it, Maddie, is we're taking this notion of identity and we're saying, yes, it's associated with a wallet, but there's a layer above that really can tie all of these wallets together. And by the way, you can have more than one identity. It doesn't mean you should have just one identity. You could have an identity that's very narrow and it's being used for NFTs purchases, or it's being used for something very specific, or you could have a very robust identity that has multiple wallets associated with it.
00:08:24.060 - 00:09:15.384, Speaker B: That's more KYC. Like, you've gone through document provision, all that stuff. And the last thing I'll say is, I think it's really important that it's reusable, because this is one of the things we see in crypto where people get this fatigue. Right? It's like, oh, my God, do I have to do Kyc again? I have to go to another Dex, I have to go to another protocol, and it's like Groundhog Day every time you go do it. So I think there's a real advantage from an adoption point of view, on the retail side, to be able to provide identity. And then on the institutional side, we do kyb at civic, and we also provide identity of an institution tied to a wallet. So this is going to crack open so many use cases, we think, for crypto and on one chain, yes, but cross chain as well.
00:09:16.324 - 00:10:00.734, Speaker C: Yeah, that's awesome. I totally agree with a lot of most of what Chris said. I love the use of decentralized identifiers, which we also make use of at ceramic, which is technology from the w three C. That's up and coming. And we see that your solana or ethereum or any other blockchain address you have is not your identity, but it facilitates your identity. And the more of these keys that you attach to a common decentralized identifier, it makes your identity stronger and less fragile. And dids are really needed to have more traditional security controls, like key rotation or a vacation, or even assigning access control rights to different pieces of data that you want to read.
00:10:00.734 - 00:10:20.254, Speaker C: And I would also just warn everyone that viewing your financial data as your identity is a huge risk. Telling everyone, here's my Solana account. And also, this is me. Bad idea. You want some anti fragility there. You need higher level control, like decentralized identifiers.
00:10:21.954 - 00:11:39.904, Speaker D: No, I agree with a lot what everyone's saying. It's sort of with parsec just going off the identities, there is that parsec sort of tries to bridge the gap between web3 and web two. And I know, like, we're trying to build identities on web3, but with Parsec, we like working with a lot of different projects. So whether that's like, I know civic has some AML stuff, so being able to a detect a transfer happening on a chain in real time, and being able to communicate with a different protocol that, hey, this deposit just happened, and being able to combine, for example, their risk data, would love to work with them on that, for example. So, yeah, I think cross chain is super important, and we've been talking to some protocols as well that want to do some cross chain stuff. So, for example, detect something happening on ETH in real time when a specific event happens, and then send that data to their Solana implementation on the other side as well. I think this cross chain data is going to be really important, whether that's to monitor all these dexs automatically, to get data off of them for arbitrage opportunities, or just to build your cross chain experience more seamlessly by detecting the data and then being able to send this data to an endpoint, to automate code or whatever you want it to do.
00:11:41.084 - 00:12:03.844, Speaker A: Great. As you build out a more comprehensive identity system and be able to surface that to decentralized apps, what are the most exciting use cases that you have seen unlocked through this ability? Or if you haven't seen them yet, what do you want to see built with this primitive?
00:12:04.864 - 00:12:56.130, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. So one of the things we're seeing at civic is the advent of permission Defi. And so I mentioned at the beginning, we're working with Solana and Solarise Dex Pro. Alameda is one of the big market makers coming into that Dex, and it's really interesting, like, what is permissioned anyway, in the context of a Dex? Well, basically it means the counterparties can be known. So if you're trading with somebody on Coinbase, for example, you know, they went through the Coinbase onboarding process, right? They had to provide their identity. They had to go do all this stuff, whether it's an individual or an institution, if you trade with somebody on Coinbase, you know who they are. We need to actually take that model and blow it out into the decentralized world, and that's where identity can really come into this.
00:12:56.130 - 00:13:42.748, Speaker B: So what we've done with the permission pools on Solana with solarise Dex pro is to say you're going to do a certain level of identity verification as retail trader or as an institution. And once you do that, you get access to these pools of liquidity that are now available for you to trade inside this little ecosystem. Now, where it gets really interesting, I think, is when you take that and you blow it out across chains. And you say, okay, I'm a yield seeking investor. I want to go look for the highest yield, but I want to be able to do it cross product and cross chain. I don't want to have to care. Is it on Ethereum? Is it on Solana? Do I have the right KYC? Am I allowed to do it? I just want to be able to go use that product.
00:13:42.748 - 00:14:19.634, Speaker B: So I think what we're building at civic and these guys as well, on this middleware kind of enablement layer, is to say, how do we get to that next level of adoption? How do we connect everything with these sort of abstracted identity elements and middleware pieces with notification? That unlocks institutional money, because the amount of money in Defi, whatever it is, it goes between 150 to 200 billion. That is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of money that wants to come in and can't yet. But pretty soon it will come in, and that's going to be a game changer.
00:14:20.534 - 00:14:21.030, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:21.102 - 00:15:16.994, Speaker C: One of the big things I see is making your data more powerful by making it your own. And one of the examples I like to give is, if you think about all the streaming services you use, whether Netflix or Hulu or HBO, you all have preference data in all these separate services, and depending on how much you use them, they have different levels of accuracy, and you often have to repeat much of the same behavior across all those sites. But if they shared a common format or even had an interoperable format, you could own the preference data yourself and share that out to any service you interact with. So I think we're seeing a transition from services competing on their user tables and more on the quality of their services. And that's what something like ceramic enables, by giving you control of your identity and your data and not requiring you to re enter it and recreate it everywhere you go.
00:15:17.854 - 00:16:08.680, Speaker D: Totally. Yeah. No, with Powersec and IQ labs just going off with, like, what we were just saying there, with, like, those streaming services, a lot of screen streaming services, they require, like you, some personal identity, which shouldn't always be the case. There's going to be instances where you need your identity, you're going to need KYC AML, but there's also going to be those other instances, more like a Dex, where you don't need that so much. So, yeah, what Parsec has built with IQ Labs is more like being able to any decentralized application, be able to use their token more as like, a decentralized SaaS subscription. That's sort of how we use it at Parsec, no one necessarily needs to. We don't need to know their identity, we just, they can purchase our tokens or rent our tokens in order to access our services as well.
00:16:08.680 - 00:16:19.014, Speaker D: But again, there's going to be both use cases, both for the decentralized and more KYC AML in order to bring that money into the ecosystem as well.
00:16:19.714 - 00:16:20.454, Speaker B: Great.
00:16:22.314 - 00:16:40.414, Speaker A: What do you guys think? We only have a few more minutes here. What do you guys think are still the biggest friction points when building a cross chain app? And what do you think needs to get solved in the next two years to make it completely frictionless for an app to connect to all these different chains?
00:16:40.874 - 00:17:47.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I think largely getting these connection points between chains to such a status that you can actually send messaging across notification services like Parsec, identity layers like what civic's doing and then getting, I think, people to understand the power of having applications that can access cross chain protocols, cross chain defi pools, being able to bring your NFT, you know, from point a to point b and represent it on any chain you want, whenever you want. Some of these consumer driven use cases have a tendency to remove friction because creative projects see the potential and they have communities they want to serve and suddenly they're out there innovating. And to the extent that we can be ready with these kind of middleware and identity layers to meet them where they are, I think things can just explode. I think in terms of friction, just because it's such a dynamic space, it makes it challenging to know which chain is ready for what at one time. But I think we'll get there. What do you guys think?
00:17:48.112 - 00:18:24.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there are many chains that are really interesting and have their own respective strengths. And to truly leverage the strengths of different tools and technologies, we need strong commonality. And that looks like really good data standards around how we interoperate on data, whether it's schemas or signature types or key types, like having a place to centralize or at least agree on how we can work together across these ecosystems will make our data more free and more powerful. And a lot of that work is happening in the w three C, decentralized identity foundation and other standards bodies.
00:18:24.794 - 00:19:00.180, Speaker D: I think the biggest thing is we see one of the trends happening right now. There's all these bridges that are being launched right now and cross chain bridges as well. One of these big trends that is happening at the moment, and you see all these different competitors pop up. So I think that's really important for cross chain to be able to ultimately get to the goal for the end user not to know what chain that they're interacting with. Obviously, we'd probably all love for it to be on Solana, but I think there's going to probably be different ecosystems just like you probably have your preferred brand. There's going to be people living in these different areas as well, I think. Great, ux.
00:19:00.180 - 00:19:23.664, Speaker D: So you eventually don't know what chain you're interacting with, but also being able to have notifications, have data, go cross chain. Hey, this deposit got transferred. It's now arrived in your other wallet or your wallet that you use across chain, and now it's ready for use. Or just to notify that, hey, this happened for your application, so you can do whatever you want to do.
00:19:25.184 - 00:19:44.072, Speaker A: And last question. We'll have a few time here, but one of the things that's important is creating a shared set of standards. And so I just quickly, if you can just talk on how you think about your specific dids or data layer becoming the standard and how you approach that.
00:19:44.208 - 00:19:59.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we agree w three C did standards should be adopted and should be implemented. There's been a ton of work that's gone into it. I think it's an important foundational stone in identity and it will foster greater adoption. Gabe?
00:20:00.132 - 00:20:09.984, Speaker C: Yeah. Ceramic is building out a data warehouse, essentially, where you can define any type of data schema and tools like that, facilitated by these standards bodies is key.
00:20:10.364 - 00:20:30.844, Speaker D: Yeah. And with Parsec, we're cross chain solution. And yeah, you can make it really easy to access that data across chain easily. But with Parsec QL, we have the standard both for real time data, but also in our historical data as well. So it's like a one stop shop. And parts of QL makes it really easy to access that data happening on chain.
00:20:31.144 - 00:20:33.664, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much, guys. Great insights.
00:20:33.784 - 00:20:34.304, Speaker B: Thanks, Matt.
