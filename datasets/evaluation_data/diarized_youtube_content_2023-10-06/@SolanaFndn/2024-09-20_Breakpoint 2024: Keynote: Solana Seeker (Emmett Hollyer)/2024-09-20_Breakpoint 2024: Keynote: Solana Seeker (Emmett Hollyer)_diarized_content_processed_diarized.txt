00:00:03.680 - 00:00:39.963, Speaker A: Hey everyone. I am Emmett. I'm the general manager of Solana Mobile. But today I come to you as the regional associate of a humble phone salesman. We founded Solana Mobile because we believe it's time for crypto to go mobile. That means bringing things that we love about web3defi token dapps to mobile phones and the things we love about mobile phones, GPS cameras, sensors to Web3. For developers, we wanted to create a free and unrestricted app store.
00:00:39.963 - 00:01:23.595, Speaker A: One without a 30% Apple and Google take rate and one without any cryptophobic censorship for users. We wanted to create a cohesive web 3 mobile experience experience with the highest level of crypto security available on any mobile device. In doing so, we thought we'd open up a new frontier for Web3 and lay a path towards breaking up the Dappstore duopoly. When we released Saga in early 2023, we were in the depths of the bear market. We knew it would be challenging and honestly there were times we doubted we'd make it at all. In fact, there were times where it seemed like everybody doubted that Saga would make it. But we became an award winning phone and things changed.
00:01:23.595 - 00:02:04.713, Speaker A: Awards happened, Meme coins happened. Bonk happened. We sold over 15,000 devices in a single day. Saga sold out. And 93% of our users have engaged with the tab store, which is now home to nearly 100 Dapps, Solana ecosystem projects and developers and distributed millions of dollars in awards to Saga users kickstarting the Web3 mobile flywheel. And although I'd love to stand up here and take all the credit, it was the ingenuity of the Solana devs and the maniacal energy of our community that made this all happen. What they showed us is that a phone is only part of the product.
00:02:04.713 - 00:02:44.401, Speaker A: And what makes the device possible is the real magic. It's more than a phone, it's Web3 magnet. Getting 20,000 devices in our users hands was a major milestone. But for crypto to go mobile, we knew we needed to make the phone more accessible, more affordable, and keep the native integration of hardware and software. The next phase, what we call chapter two, depended on us selling at least 100,000 units. It was a huge step into the unknown, but the response has been overwhelming. Chapter 2 sold more units in its first day than Saga sold in a year.
00:02:44.401 - 00:03:21.895, Speaker A: With our community support, we exceeded our target in a matter of weeks. So now, with over 140,000 units pre sold in 57 countries, our flywheel is fully in motion. With $150 million of recurrent flowing to Chapter 2 preorders. So far, it's clear to us that we're onto something special here and we're so honored that you put your faith in us. It's what drives us every day. The progress that our team is making is really impressive, but today we can start to show you just some of the reasons why we're so excited for Chapter two. That's why I'm here to show the next chapter for Solana Mobile.
00:03:21.895 - 00:05:13.285, Speaker A: Chapter two for Salon Mobile is Seeker, and I actually have a prototype with me today. Want to see it? It's amazing that we've come this far that we have a working Seeker prototype in my hand, but what exactly is Solana Seeker? We see it as the definitive Web3 mobile device. Clearly, the team has been deep in build mode for the last few months and we've made a ton of progress, but there is plenty of work left to be done. But let me show you around. Seeger is a beautiful mobile phone engineered to harmonize its hardware and its software for Web3. It's lighter, it's brighter, it's got better cameras, and the battery lasts longer, all at a much more accessible price point than its predecessor. Like its predecessor, the Seabolt is at the heart of Seekers.
00:05:13.285 - 00:06:10.625, Speaker A: Seed Vault lives in its own environment, abstracted away from apps and the Android operating system to keep your seeds safe, it's designed to give the highest level of crypto security available on any mobile device. But with Seeker, we've taken things one step further, introducing SeedVault Wallet. Created exclusively for Seeker with our friends at Soulflare, the SeedVault wallet is a mobile first wallet that's natively integrated to supercharge your cvault experience. That means we can provide major UX upgrades for our users so you can send transactions with a simple double tap and save your fingers from a workout. You can also choose between a primary mode and a burner mode to ensure peace, of mind, save time, and never have to worry about complicated account management again. Where we built C to offer the best possible security for our users, we're building Seed Vault Wallet. To offer the best possible experience.
00:06:10.625 - 00:07:21.595, Speaker A: In the Seed Vault Wallet, we'll plug into an updated Solana DAPP Store. We've equipped the DAPP Store with new features like rewards tracking to monitor all of the earning and rewards opportunities you have on Seeker in one place, we'll have support for web apps and we'll have improved discoverability. We think that's going be really important because there are tons of teams already building for Seeker with zero fees and crypto friendly policies, the Solana Dappstore will continue to be the home of the best mobile Web three experiences. And of course every Seeker comes with a Seeker Genesis Token. It's the key to unlocking rewards, access and content across the slot ecosystem. For our users, the Genesis Token is a proof of a VIP membership into the heart of Solana and for builders it gives the confidence that whether you're testing new features or launching new rewards programs, you're connecting directly with real live Solana mobile OGs. And until Seeker launches, the Chapter 2 Pre Order Token will help keep those rewards flowing to anybody who has pre ordered Seekers.
00:07:21.595 - 00:08:42.205, Speaker A: Seeker is a beacon for Solana Dapps, Defi, Deepin Payments, AI, NFT games, you name it. If it's happening on Solana, it's happening on Seeker. This is the Solana ecosystem in your pocket and since we've announced the interest from not in, the ecosystem has been crazy. We have a lot of teams building a lot of great things that I don't have the time for today, but why don't we give a brief glimpse of what's to come. Whether you use Seeker as your daily device or your secondary crypto burner, you can put it to work earning for you with various Deepin apps and Helium Mobile will be providing four free months of coverage to Seekers and introducing Seeker exclusive earnings opportunities for mapping the growing Helium network. We worked closely with Helium and other Deepin teams to make sure that Seeker and all of its sensors are optimized for builders, enabling them to build more advanced Deepin apps custom for Seeker. And as many of you know, earning rewards is great, but with Seeker you can create the rewards you want to see in the world.
00:08:42.205 - 00:10:05.623, Speaker A: Moonshot, powered by Dexcrainer, will be launching its token platform with Seeker only optimizations. Seekers will be able to launch their own tokens and even auto allocate a share of those tokens to other Seekers with a single click and tokens launched on Moonshot via Seeker will enjoy automatic boosts for both Discoverability and rewards on their platform. Solana was the first blockchain to integrate AI and Seeker carries that one step further. Seeker users can use Aletheia AI to generate tokenized AI agents of new or familiar faces that can interact on chain with your favorite programs or with the rest of the slot community. And gamers will find a slew of Web3 games and Seeker exclusives, including limited edition assets and rewards in Parallel Colony, which will be launching in the DAPP store when Seeker releases. In addition to the Great DAP exclusives that will be coming to Seeker. Helios is launching air Trip, a CK compression tool that makes AirDrops 4,000 times cheaper.
00:10:05.623 - 00:10:45.795, Speaker A: Where previously it used to cost over $40,000 to AirDrop to the whole of the Solana Mobile Pre order community. Airship reduces those costs to as little as $100. And every airdrop initiated on air will have the option to auto allocate to the chapter 2 preorder token holder group. And that's just the beginning. Like I said, it would take all day to stand up here and walk through all of the great experiences we've got in store. The story of Solana Mobile has been written by the Solana community. And chapter two of that story is the Solana.
00:10:45.795 - 00:10:59.001, Speaker A: We invite every team in the Solana ecosystem to participate in writing what comes next. Our team is here. I see a lot of familiar faces. We're here at Breakpoint. We have a booth. Come find us. Come get in touch.
00:10:59.001 - 00:11:30.395, Speaker A: We are very excited to hear what you're building. Seeker will be shipping in mid-2025 and we cannot wait to get it in your hands. To those of you that have already pre ordered, you'll know that the chapter 2 pre order token is proof that these rewards are just. And to those of you that haven't, we've reintroduced the founder window presale price back down to $450 through the end of Breakpoint. Breakpoint. Thank you so much for having us. Like I said, our booth is out there.
00:11:30.395 - 00:11:39.445, Speaker A: We've got some great swag we'd love to hand off. We'd love to hear what you're excited about for Seeker, what you're building. So come speak, spend some time with us. Let's talk. Thanks so much everybody.
