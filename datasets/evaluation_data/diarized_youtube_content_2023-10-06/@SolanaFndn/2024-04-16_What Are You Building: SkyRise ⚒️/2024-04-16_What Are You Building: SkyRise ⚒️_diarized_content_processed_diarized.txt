00:00:04.240 - 00:00:36.376, Speaker A: Hello. Today I'm joined by Chico from Skyrise. So please tell us, what are you building? We aim to elevate products by giving them the resources that they need. That way we allow devs to dev while we bring all the other stuff into the mix, all the way from business development to go to market strategies. We got into these because for the longest time I've been in the Solana ecosystem and helped put together a lot of initiatives like hacker houses and even accelerate early projects. And we realized that there was not enough resources, so we decided to bring them in and just connect these founders with the different things. Well, that sounds super useful.
00:00:36.376 - 00:00:49.064, Speaker A: It's like perfect for Mountain dial here. Yeah, Mountain Dwar is a great place to get to know more founders and we actually working on Mountain Dao, helping them produce the whole thing. So it's actually great. Awesome. Thank you so much for doing this and thank you for being here. Thank you.
