00:00:04.320 - 00:00:43.091, Speaker A: Today, I'm joined by Simon. So, please tell us, what are you building? I'm building Solana id, which is the flagship identity protocol for the Solana EcoSystem, catering to Dapps and users. So our vision is to bring identity systems to every single user on Solana and help them to get more value from their data and their wallets, and squeeze that value out of the dapps that can now target the right users for the right app that they're building. This will help with spam, right? This will help a lot of things. So it helps with spam, it helps with bots, it helps apps to find users that actually stick to the application and find the power users that don't just farm and run away, but stay with them and actually use the product. Awesome. So get your idea, everybody.
00:00:43.091 - 00:00:46.075, Speaker A: Exactly. Get your solid pass on pass. Solana ID.
