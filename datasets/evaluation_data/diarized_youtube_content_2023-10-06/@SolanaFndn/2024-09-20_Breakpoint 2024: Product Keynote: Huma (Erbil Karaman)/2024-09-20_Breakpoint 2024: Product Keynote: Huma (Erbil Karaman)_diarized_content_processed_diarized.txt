00:00:07.520 - 00:00:37.319, Speaker A: Hello everyone. My name is Abiy Karaman. I'm co founder of Human Finance, the first PayFi network. Let's first define what payment financing means. Payment financing is the trade of time value of money. The vast majority of business and people around the world today depend on a form of payment financing. Credit cards alone facilitate $16 trillion in merchant payments.
00:00:37.319 - 00:01:19.365, Speaker A: Trade finance enables $10 trillion in business to business payments. One in every six families depend on remittances. Money sent back home cross the borders. And that system alone depends on trillions of dollars locked in pre funding accounts. The list goes on and on. And while the demand for payment financing is increasing every passing day, the financial institutions are unable or maybe unwilling to fulfill this demand. What do we do? It is so ingrained in our lives that without payment financing, the entire economy stops growing.
00:01:19.365 - 00:01:54.615, Speaker A: Crypto was supposed to solve this problem. We introduced Bitcoin to solve peer to peer payments. Stablecoins improve user experiences and accessibility. Helped get us to a point where today the stablecoin payment volume is comparable to the VISA network. However, it's not enough. If you really want 100x the growth of payments, we need payments financing. A form of payment financing that leverages blockchains and stablecoins natively.
00:01:54.615 - 00:02:37.083, Speaker A: And that's what we call payfi. If we can give people the control of when to get paid and when to pay, that is financial freedom. How do we make this happen? To answer that question, we need to go back a little bit. We need to go back to the beginning of Internet when we first started using networks. Networks were called intranets. These were proprietary networks that didn't talk to each other. A few visionaries came together and defined what we call OSI model, an open systems interconnected model that was built for Internet of data.
00:02:37.083 - 00:03:12.987, Speaker A: And with that we have Internet. Today it's a seven layer architecture that has actually created this interoperable network. And with that for the past 30, 40 years we have enjoyed so many innovations, our lives are reshaped. So to solve the problem of payment financing on chain, we thought about the same model applied to the Internet of Money. We published an article defining the PayFi stack. A six layer stack. On the bottom you have a transaction layer, L1s and L2s.
00:03:12.987 - 00:03:59.891, Speaker A: Solana is one of the best. On top of it you have the currency layer, you have custard layer, the wallets, you have compliance layer, financing layer and the application layer. All of this can define an open model for us to create the payment financing leveraging blockchains and stable coins us at Huma are focused on the financing layer. The financing layer is about connecting capital, demand and supply. It deals with risk and assets, pricing, structuring, tokenization and distribution. If you think about what this enables, it enables things like digital asset backed credit cards. It enables trade financing with verifiable invoices.
00:03:59.891 - 00:04:48.925, Speaker A: It enables deepin machine financing, cross border payment financing T solutions that work 247 because financial institutions don't, the PayFi customer has been growing. There are many amazing applications that are gaining momentum. I don't have the time to go into every single one of them, but you should check them out. So far Kuma has done more than $1.9 billion of PayFi transactions growing 10% month over month with $0 of credit default and with more than half a billion dollars of demand in the pipeline per month. Think about this. Think about the curve of this growth and how faster we can grow if we can fulfill all of that demand.
00:04:48.925 - 00:05:29.963, Speaker A: The exciting news today is this Shima protocol is coming to Solana. We have been building a pretty sophisticated platform in the Ethereum ecosystem and in a few months we're launching on Solana. It is the most advanced RWA protocol to ever launch on Solana with large Solana foundations focused on PayFi. We love this ecosystem and we are putting all of our efforts to grow this together. PayFi is a new front of RWA. If you think about defi, it all happened for too long. Unsustainable yields coming from Ponzanomics and dilutionary emissions.
00:05:29.963 - 00:05:58.083, Speaker A: With Ondo and others we credit this our delay season 1T bills bringing real yield. But with the Fed cutting rates aggressively, that's also going down. What we need is to support the business and people around the world with sustainable yield, double digit yield coming on chain and that's possible with auto glaze season two that as possible with PayFi. Let's wake up. It's PayFi time on Solana. Come talk to us to become a lunch partner. Let's fucking go.
00:05:58.083 - 00:05:58.635, Speaker A: Thank you.
