00:00:04.400 - 00:00:30.869, Speaker A: Today I'm joined by Kyle from Hedgehog Markets. So please tell us, what are you building? So we at Hedgehog are building permissionless prediction markets on Solana. The goal is to build out a great UI and great user experience so that users can interact easily with the on chain prediction markets. We actually have three different types, so one is like the traditional AMM style where you're trading yes and no shares. And then we also have paramutual and soon PVP markets. So we're excited to get those live in the next week or so. Awesome.
00:00:30.869 - 00:00:43.525, Speaker A: Can everyone just create their own markets right now? You can create your own paramutual market. We're trying to streamline some of the other market creation processes just to make it more clear for resolutions at the end of the markets for users. Awesome. Thank you so much.
