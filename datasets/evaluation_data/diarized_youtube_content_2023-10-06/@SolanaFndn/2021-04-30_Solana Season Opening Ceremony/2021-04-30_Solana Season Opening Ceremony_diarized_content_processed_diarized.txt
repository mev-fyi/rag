00:08:24.954 - 00:08:28.734, Speaker A: To have faith is to believe unconditionally.
00:10:53.784 - 00:10:59.684, Speaker B: I don't see us up yet. It still says offline for me.
00:11:03.344 - 00:11:04.244, Speaker A: We're up.
00:11:05.264 - 00:11:18.024, Speaker B: I'm not. 1 second. Okay. There we go. Awesome. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the opening ceremony, talk of Solana season.
00:11:18.024 - 00:11:34.044, Speaker B: Sorry we were a little late. We're having some technical issues, but we're back online now while we're getting things wrapped up. Would love to just kind of get the soul symbol, the sun. Everyone say hello. Introduce yourself in the chat. Let's make some friends. Things are kind of already blowing up there.
00:11:34.044 - 00:12:19.162, Speaker B: If you have any questions during this presentation, feel free to drop all your questions there. And I'll be scrolling through the chat towards the end, and we'll try to answer as many as we can just to kind of kick things off. We have Anatolian Kovenka with us, who is the CEO and co founder of Solana. And then we have Raj Gokul, who is the COO and co founder of Solana, with us. And during this talk, we're going to take about 25, 30 minutes, and we're just going to go over, really, what the Solana season hackathon is, the different global tracks that are involved, the prizes that are involved, projects we would love to see you all build, and just really what we're excited about. There's a lot of really, really interesting things going on in the ecosystem right now. Projects are popping up quicker than we can keep track of.
00:12:19.162 - 00:12:50.450, Speaker B: People are getting incredibly innovative, and we're seeing tons of new use cases really utilizing the speed, latency, and efficiency of the chain. And we're hoping to see that just continue to compound through this hackathon. So just a quick overview. Solana season was officially announced yesterday. Hacking is going to start on May 15, and there's a 1 million global prize pool. Underneath the 1 million global prize pool, we have four specific regional tracks. We have a track specifically for eastern Europe.
00:12:50.450 - 00:13:34.274, Speaker B: We have a track specifically for China. We have a track specifically for Brazil, and we have a track specifically for India. And we've received a lot of questions around what these specific tracks mean. And essentially, when you submit your project, if you have one of these regions in your location, you're then pulled together, and only folks from that region can access that prize. And so this is kind of our way of starting to really incubate and help help projects in those regions grow and receive tailored help from advisors and partners in that region. And so I think, without further ado, I'm going to toss it off to Anatoly Anatoly, just if you want to give a little more in depth intro of yourself and just some overviews of some projects you would love to see build.
00:13:34.894 - 00:14:30.654, Speaker C: Hey, folks, this is Anatoly. So, if you guys have never heard me present about Solana, I'm just an engineer. I had kind of the idea for proof of history and had a bit of luck getting all my friends from Qualcomm to come together and build this thing over the last three years. And our goal is to make the fastest, cheapest, most censorship resistant network in the planet. Because we think that if we succeed there, then we can really empower the world with cryptography. And that's kind of a unstoppable force. The people that can use this stuff together coordinate around the world, simply by signing some elliptical curves, can basically disrupt all the bad things that we see in the world right now.
00:14:30.654 - 00:14:46.224, Speaker C: Facebook, Google, all the data thefts and things like that. And all the financial inequality can be dramatically reduced just from people empowered with cryptography. So we're pretty excited about building this with you guys.
00:14:49.204 - 00:15:06.574, Speaker B: And so, Anatolia, as far as projects you would love to see, we've just seen an accelerated growth in the ecosystem. Projects are popping up left and right. I think just this morning we discovered another three or four projects that had launched. What do you think is currently missing, and what would you love to see built from this hackathon?
00:15:08.034 - 00:16:32.920, Speaker C: I mean, it's always like, the hardest thing to find are those founders that have that kind of killer instinct and drive to eat glass, as we like to say, for two to three years. And if you have that, then the ideas are not as important. But in my mind, some of the more interesting ideas to explore are there's always a ton of permutations of finance, even things that seem like Ethereum is doing this thing. If you build it on Solana with rust and serum, the design is so different that it's going to be a different product and a different permutation of it with its unique characteristics, even just starting what's missing on Solano today, go build it. But if you start thinking about, how do I take this idea and then scale it to 100 million people, that becomes an interesting, challenging problem on its own. How do you actually take a lending protocol and make it usable by 100 million people around the world? There's a lot of stuff to explore there, and we need those founders with the killer instincts to do that kind of thing. On the non defi side, I'm really excited for folks that want to explore community building.
00:16:32.920 - 00:17:23.100, Speaker C: Daos really like, the true web3 ethos of how do we socially coordinate people into groups and start creating ecosystems without necessarily a single independent coordinator? You still have, you know, Cyril from Cope. Like, you have, like, people that start those things and move things forward, but it's really cool to see a community that kind of takes. Takes it over and kind of starts moving on its own legs. That's always exciting. So if you have, like, an idea for social tokens, right, you're like, you really believe that every human in the world needs its own token that. Go try it. Like, right? Like, the tech is there, so let's go.
00:17:23.100 - 00:17:24.344, Speaker C: Let's go try it.
00:17:25.834 - 00:17:34.014, Speaker B: Raj, I know social tokens and daos are something that you were tweeting about recently. Anything else you wanted to add? That or any other thoughts you wanted to expand on there?
00:17:37.194 - 00:18:38.134, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty clear to me at this point that taking a community that already exists, that feels like it's on the verge of being a Dao, like, it feels like it's bursting at the seams. People are finding janky ways to coordinate their actions and especially their capital. And I think we all saw it with Wall street bets last year. That was the one for me that made it immediately clear we're going to see probably 100 different DAos that are hedge funds, that are running complex strategies and building logic for when to cascade and coordinate their capital toward different strategies. And that stuff is definitely happening on Ethereum. I think Solana ecosystem has been catching up with building all the DeFi primitives, but it feels like in the last 60 days, we've really seen a lot of that flesh out. We've just seen a couple of borrower lending protocols launch and that was one of the last few pieces.
00:18:38.134 - 00:19:34.434, Speaker A: The NFT stuff I know is really coming along. I think if people are skating to where the puck is going to be, building daos, building social coordination tools, chat is a big one. I think it kind of went under the radar a little bit, but satellite launched recently. I think their beta is on matic, but they're going to be porting to Solana pretty soon. I think that project is totally open source, so I can imagine people repurposing it, using it, finding things to plug into satellite, or finding ways to plug satellite into their app. I think a lot of people have been dreaming about control boxes in every Solana app and I haven't seen it yet, but I'm 100% positive it's going to happen within the next 90 days. So it's just a matter of who does it.
00:19:36.054 - 00:20:12.304, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I think expanding on that, we already have several projects on Solana that are really moving forward with this web3 interface, which is one of the tracks we have available projects like Audius that have. I think they're like 4 million monthly actives at this point. And then there's several other projects being built out. Star Alice is another one who's building out a metaverse on Solana. And so there's these projects that are realizing the pain points of their existing infrastructure that are seeing Solana as really the only viable option to grow to this mass adoption. On that same note, we have three tracks for this hackathon.
00:20:12.304 - 00:20:26.904, Speaker B: We have a web3 track, we have an NFT tract, and then we have a defi track. Raj, for you. Specifically, outside of just the Dao and social tokens, are there really any types of projects that you would love to see build or anything that you're particularly excited about?
00:20:28.964 - 00:21:14.754, Speaker A: I think there's a few, like some would consider less sexy. But if you look. If you just look at, like, doing analytics on Ethereum and any VM compatible chains. I remember last summer, some of the most viral sharing was just showing graphs and seeing within 30 minutes, a couple hours, or the first 12 hours of a project, how its key metrics were exploding was what guided most of the market. And we don't have that graphing. Solana is still a small team. Dune has been focusing on EVM chains.
00:21:14.754 - 00:22:04.084, Speaker A: The graph is coming, but it may take a little while. So I think in the meantime, there's a lot of opportunity for anybody that just makes it super easy to show what's happening on the chain, what's happening with a given project. I think within two weeks, you could probably bang out something. Larry Cermak from. From the block actually put together a really comprehensive and pretty easy list of requirements that he'd like to see for any introspection tools that just show basic analytics on new projects. I think if somebody knocks that out of the park, that's a viable business in itself, and it's very differentiated, needs to happen natively on Solana, and it would be used heavily out of the gates by a lot of people.
00:22:06.784 - 00:22:26.976, Speaker B: Definitely. And I think we've also partnered with a few projects internally who have their own prize pool. Serum has a 25k prize pool. Ken has a 25k prize pool. Radium has a 40k prize pool. Pith has a 25k prize pool. And then our network actually recently just came on for a 25k prize pool.
00:22:26.976 - 00:23:07.306, Speaker B: And so I think there's a lot of these other projects just that are really willing to throw money behind the right team, the right developers that are looking to scale and build on top of Solana. I think wrapping around the last hackathon, because I'm assuming a handful of folks here probably already applied. If you haven't, it's just salon.com hackathon that'll redirect you to the proper page where you can find out all the information and submit your application. You don't need to have a full fleshed out product. Any free agent can apply, and then we'll actually start to pair you and help you find a team to get building. I know you were really involved with this, Raj, but we had two main winners from the last hackathon.
00:23:07.306 - 00:23:30.514, Speaker B: We had mango markets and psyoptions. But outside of that, there was huge demand for some of the other winners. Do you want to just kind of expand on what folks can expect? So let's say they apply, their team gets to the final end. What can folks expect as far as support and resources from us? So what's really the benefit of winning the hackathon here? Why should folks put their time and effort behind it?
00:23:31.654 - 00:24:46.704, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, totally feel free to jump in, but I think there's pretty clear support from engineering team. Every major investor in the industry takes, I would say, a pretty hard look at winning projects. I think probably ten or 15 projects from the last hackathon got seed funding on their own, so it's not even really dependent on winning the seed funding prizes. Folks are really excited about what comes out of Solana because they know that there's a competitive differentiation in having no scaling ceiling and being super fast, being cheap, being efficient. They know it's going to be a web to like experience. And obviously from Solana's end, I think just like we're bringing folks from the last hackathon into this one, we're always really excited about showing success case studies and highlighting progress for teams that have built. So winners of the hackathon kind of get pretty consistent exposure as long as they're executing, which tends to be the case.
00:24:46.704 - 00:26:14.824, Speaker A: And I think one thing I'll add is you don't have to wait until you win. I think Mango markets and psy options. Last year, it was like two months ago, I'm pretty sure both of them had a Twitter, launched a landing page, had a logo, had an emoji, and started collecting waitlist and talking to their target audiences about what it was they were building, what their approach was and started getting feedback immediately even within their telegram group as they were building inflight within the hackathon. And that's part of honestly, I think what made them successful. Everybody that decides to build on Solana, I always tell them go name it, call it something, give it an identity, put it out there. I promise you it will be like Rocket fuel because you have to integrate with the community and start talking to your users. And the best way to do that is to just get out there and showing traction with those users and that audience and showing that there's demand for it is as important as just writing really great code or building a great product, connecting with the market and showing that you can grow the thing is critical and it's considered as part of the judging criteria.
00:26:16.484 - 00:26:19.184, Speaker B: Yeah. Anatoly, do you have anything you wanted to add to that?
00:26:20.004 - 00:27:15.474, Speaker C: Yeah, this like starting early with the actual product kind of like community building side makes a huge difference because you kind of get almost instant feedback from the folks that are going to be your customers. If you have an idea that's worth funding, you know, that's worth like product market fit. But it's like all the stuff that you read in every Paul Graham essay or every startup book in Silicon Valley. Talk to your customers, go figure out what are the key critical pieces of your idea that have product market fit and then iterate, execute as fast as you can. Having that instinct is pretty important. I want to make sure that, you know, like the space is so early, right? Like the next Facebook is going to be built on blockchain. It's going to be using cryptography.
00:27:15.474 - 00:28:11.174, Speaker C: None of this stuff exists yet. So if you have those ideas, like how do I like really super connect the world, it's perfect time to start because it's going to take you like, you know, you're going to, if you have a little bit of success now, you're still going to be iterating for the next two or three years before you really hit that like crazy point of inflection where all of a sudden everyone in the world is using this. So we're still pretty far and it's still pretty early, but it's just growing so quickly that there's a ton of energy in the space. And if like, I don't know, like this reminds me of like 1996 Internet, like when I first started programming I saw like how the world was connecting, how Linux and open source for sharing these ideas for free without the hand of Microsoft being involved. And it seemed like a pretty powerful thing.
00:28:14.234 - 00:29:02.466, Speaker B: Yeah, most certainly. I think I just wanted to emphasize a point that Raj made as well, which is just starting early and getting your social channels up, like developing a brand, developing design. That's something that a lot of the projects that really stood out and ended up winning already had their own established community like Solana can really help kickstart that because things are thriving and growing exponentially. But developing that brand, talking to potential customers and just getting out there is one of the easiest ways to get ahead, and it really, it's something that drastically gets overlooked. But the importance of that community and those early adopters of your products can't be stressed enough. Toli, there are a handful of comments in the chat that are in Russian. I have no idea what they say.
00:29:02.466 - 00:29:20.734, Speaker B: If any of them are good, feel free to answer them. But a couple of folks were asking about rust. I think this is something that comes up frequently. I saw that you were multitasking and tweeted out resources as well. But if folks are joining and they're not super familiar with Rust, what's the best way to get started?
00:29:21.514 - 00:30:17.852, Speaker C: There's a playground and a rust book that's fairly easy. If you've done development in any modern day language, it really takes about a week or two to pick up. So if you're already like an engineer, it shouldn't be a big lift. It's a language that's gaining a lot of popularity in the traditional tech world. So Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, they've been contributing GitHub projects in Rust. So there's a lot of engineering resources, I think, from the big companies we've seen recently, some very first baby steps of using rust in the Linux kernel. To give you an idea why that's a really big deal is because the Linux kernel has a similar performance security constraints as Solana.
00:30:17.852 - 00:30:36.414, Speaker C: It really can never go wrong. It must be as fast as possible. And that's something that we're super excited about, because if it's a language that gets adoption in those really critical areas, then we just have this amazing alignment for the rest of Solana's lifetime.
00:30:37.754 - 00:30:40.634, Speaker A: These are systems that are used in space, right?
00:30:40.714 - 00:30:41.946, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:30:42.130 - 00:31:27.434, Speaker A: Battle hardened for decades, and a community of people that are using the same language that are also engineering for space and for all these other mission critical systems around the planet, is a community that's more durable and that will have more support and more entry points for people of all skill sets. And that's why it's important to use a language that's not specific to any one chain and develop specifically for that chain. That's a decision that you made very early on that I think we're starting to see the fruits of, because what do you always say? You made this as close to the. Can you describe how you approach smart contract scripting in rust?
00:31:28.014 - 00:32:30.624, Speaker C: Yeah, we wanted to make this as close to a vanilla rust development experience as possible so people that can go look at the publicly available resources and then just look at Solana as like, oh, these are the set of APIs that I need to use and they can get started. And that's really important for developer adoption. We need the devs to be self serve. They need to be able to figure out and unblock themselves. And we've seen some of the projects, like serum, have been on a tear, building out libraries and tooling to make, launching new smart contracts, new tokens, new markets, as easy as possible. Yeah, I would recommend folks that are starting, once you figure out how rust works, to go look at the anchor library that Armani has built from serum. It's pretty wild.
00:32:34.484 - 00:33:17.344, Speaker B: I think, to jump in here for one other question, because this is something we also get a lot is, can you join with just an idea, not a lot of coding skills. And the answer is yes. A lot of these projects apply, and they're just engineers. And unfortunately, they don't have the resources on the marketing or community side to build out that infrastructure of the project. And so if you're a community developer, you're a marketer, you're a business development person, like, please, please, please apply. There are going to be hundreds of really high quality teams that could use your skill sets to really help take them to the next level. And we have plenty of resources available once you apply to help you get paired and help you be as impactful to those projects as possible.
00:33:17.344 - 00:33:34.824, Speaker B: And so we actually have some special guests that are going to be joining us, but before we bring them up, totally. Raj, did you have any last comments or words of encouragement for everyone joining? Is this going to be easy? Is it going to be hard? What should everyone get excited about and look forward to? Here.
00:33:38.264 - 00:33:52.124, Speaker C: Go build. I mean, just don't even, don't even think about it. This should be fun. That's really. Just focus on having fun. Focus on learning something new and trying out a crazy idea and have some experiments.
00:33:54.984 - 00:34:27.734, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. I think the entire ethos of Solana is about enabling someone to just get started and, and build something that might be a piece of the future and have a ton of fun doing it. And I think if you just start small, think of a feature even if it's like a feature for the Explorer that you want to, that you just want to see and do a pull request, start somewhere, learn rust if you haven't, and learn through the work, through the project, through the feature that you want to build.
00:34:28.514 - 00:34:59.883, Speaker B: Perfect. Thank you both. And joining us today, we have psyoptions. They were actually one of the winners of the Defi hackathon, so we wanted to bring them on. I appreciate you joining Taylor, Tommy, and they're just going to take a few moments to really talk about their experience building the last hackathon, any tips they have for folks that are joining, and really what things were like after they won and how things have grown since then. So, Taylor, Tommy, I'll allow you all to make some introduction to yourself and take it from here.
00:35:01.343 - 00:35:04.054, Speaker D: Thanks, Austin. Thanks for having us.
00:35:08.394 - 00:35:47.434, Speaker E: I mean, this was an idea. Taylor and I just kind of were like, we got denied access to our brokerages API, and that's what made us think like, well, if we built options into the blockchain, then everyone would have inherent API access built in, and that was the genesis. So this was just like, we just want to build this for ourselves. And we kind of talked to the Solana team about what we were thinking and they were like, you should enter the hackathon we're about to launch. We're like, okay, let's do that. And then a week later, we put out a Twitter and got some traction. And I mean, like, it was just this parabolic curve that just like, changed everything since.
00:35:47.434 - 00:36:10.924, Speaker E: So, you know, we've had to figure out how to deal with, like, legal structures and make sure we can launch this thing appropriately. And, and there's just a lot of stuff we had to catch up on. But it's been an incredible ride with a ton of support from the Solana team, a ton of support from the community. It's just incredible. I don't know if you have anything to add to that specifically, Taylor.
00:36:11.944 - 00:36:45.854, Speaker D: Well, yeah, no, I mean, definitely to Raj's point earlier and Ty's point and kind of what everyone's been saying, but, you know, it's never too early to start the community. I think that, you know, had a huge impact on how we did in the hackathon, but also the trajectory of the project post hackathon. I mean, just having the support from a community, not only during the hackathon, but post hackathon kind of gives us the motivation to continue working on the project. And I think it's, you know, something that's, that's super valuable. And then allowing you to collect feedback as you go, you know, no matter what your project is, is great.
00:36:49.514 - 00:36:52.138, Speaker E: Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
00:36:52.226 - 00:37:19.284, Speaker C: That's awesome that you guys were inspired by lack of easy access to this stuff and in the centralized world. Part of, like, I mean, one of the reasons, like, why I started Solano is because I couldn't get access to, like, trading APIs through, like, interactive brokers. Everything was expensive and, like, a huge pain in the butt to use. So I was like, what if it was all on chain? Then it would all be free. That's pretty cool.
00:37:20.464 - 00:37:47.204, Speaker E: Yeah, that's exactly why we started, you know, and we're hoping to get it. Get it out there soon. I know that's the one thing is, you know, this was, like, kind of part time, and I guess the other thing changed is, like, you know, it's probably going to change my career trajectory here pretty soon and, you know, really be able to focus on this, because now you have this community and this, you know, you know, 10,000 plus people following you, asking, when is this going to launch? You know? So kind of got to give the people what they want, right?
00:37:49.584 - 00:37:51.404, Speaker C: Yeah. No pressure.
00:37:56.814 - 00:38:26.370, Speaker B: Yes. So, Taylor and Tommy, I would love for you all just to kind of take a few moments to talk about your experience. So it kind of seems like out of necessity, psy options has come to life. And so what were things like when you were actually going through the building process? And then do you have any tips or suggestions for individuals that were in your place just two months ago, three months ago? It feels like a year ago, like Raj said. But tips or suggestions you have for folks that are just starting out now?
00:38:26.562 - 00:38:45.554, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I would definitely say, you know, start. Start reading the Solana documentation and, you know, like, start. Start breaking up your. Your idea into as small chunks as possible. I mean, in terms of development, the Solana building space has, like, changed completely since. Since a couple months ago. Right.
00:38:45.554 - 00:39:32.914, Speaker D: Like we were building before. I think anchor was really launched, so haven't had a chance to actually play with it, and I highly recommend it. Using a framework will save you a load of time, but at the same time, it's also important to understand what's going on under the hood. So if you can read rust, at least, I highly recommend digging into the Solana source code. I know we spent plenty of late nights digging in the source code to figure out how we can best architect it. And to that point, with the way Solana is built and how the runtime works, I highly recommend understanding that before you start building because it's going to take some time. You can't architect your protocol the same way you would on Ethereum or on some other EVM chain.
00:39:32.914 - 00:39:40.134, Speaker D: So I highly recommend taking some time upfront to think about how you want to design your protocol or program before you start building it.
00:39:41.034 - 00:40:17.854, Speaker E: Yeah. To that point, I think one of the big changes is the fact that you kind of, you kind of have to know, like, the account size or like, what data you're storing on chain and how big that data is going to be up front. Like, that'll really help because you can't, it's not flexible like the EVM or not expanding. So with that, like, I think really dig into like, the account architecture and kind of figure out how you're going to, like, model your, like, I guess, different structures and how that's going to be stored on chain. That's probably like the biggest thing to think about when architecting.
00:40:23.554 - 00:41:31.122, Speaker C: That's kind of like, there's this developer Paul, that wrote a really good blog post that recommend everybody reading first that kind of goes through how the account model works and why everything is a program. If you've had experience dealing with, I would say, like, old school databases that are super, like those transactional systems or, you know, operating systems, you know, or scatter gather, if that makes sense to you, then you'll be in the right place. But we design this not because we wanted to make developers suffer. It's designed for speed, and usually that means people, somebody has to suffer, right. If you're building for speed, it means, like, somebody has to pay for it and it's a little bit more awkward. But the folks like anchor has done a really good job putting the stuff together, so it's fairly easy to get going and get started. I don't know if you guys saw Armani posted like a 500 line rust implementation of swapping on serum, which is pretty cool.
00:41:31.122 - 00:41:35.094, Speaker C: I'm surprised he got that down into that small of a program.
00:41:36.474 - 00:41:40.014, Speaker D: Yeah, I saw it, but I haven't had a chance to dig into the code yet.
00:41:40.754 - 00:42:33.846, Speaker E: Yeah, we've kind of been running with our archaic stuff. I mean, I guess for context, Taylor and I didn't know Russ before we started taking to Solana. And I mean, we had a little bit leg up once we started sign options because we had a failed project for the first hackathon. Started digging to Solana last summer. So we started reading up on rust, but we built our own integration test that deploys our program and runs a bunch of the, you know, sends a bunch of transactions and sets everything up and tears it down, like, all of ourselves. So, like, we have this kind of understanding of what anchor has done, and it's like, if you can use anchor and figure it out, like, use it because our thing is a hairball to get what we wanted out of it. But, you know, having that confidence and having those integration tests, you know, when you're just getting started with a runtime or a language can, can be a world of a difference to moving fast.
00:42:33.846 - 00:42:55.744, Speaker E: And especially when we got something out very quick for the hackathon. But when it came time of like, all right, we got to take this on because people really want us to actually launch this thing and use it, and we got to get it audited, and we need to make sure everything's right. We had to refactor our architecture completely from the protocol standpoint. So having those integration tests, too, made that way easier.
00:42:57.404 - 00:43:05.916, Speaker C: Awesome. I mean, that's like the true MVP. Get to an MVP, then iterate. That's awesome.
00:43:05.980 - 00:43:06.944, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:43:07.724 - 00:43:08.156, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:08.220 - 00:43:09.156, Speaker D: Still iterating.
00:43:09.300 - 00:43:10.024, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:14.244 - 00:43:45.674, Speaker B: So I think, Taylor and Tommy, I would love to hear quickly just what your experience was like after winning the hackathon. I know there's been a lot that's going on. Just support resources that were available to you, how you feel like that really helped propel your project forward. While they're talking about that, totally, a lot of folks are asking for the link to this blog post that you mentioned. I don't know if you have it on hand, but if you can drop it in the chat or send it to me and I'll drop it in the chat for them, we can get the folks that, but take it away from Taylor Tommy. That's a mouthful. Taylor Tommy.
00:43:48.334 - 00:44:38.864, Speaker D: TNT yeah, I mean, post hackathon, I mean, the community has been outstanding. I mean, I feel like there's more and more developers building on Solana that you can bounce ideas off of every day. The Solana team itself has been super helpful, and, you know, especially when it comes to development or whether it's community building or even general things like legal structure and stuff like that building in the crypto space is. It's all a gray area. No one knows exactly what they're doing. So getting consensus from other people about what the best paths are, what mistakes have been made in the past to avoid, is invaluable. I think the Solana team, CRM team, and the community as a whole has kind of been super helpful with us guiding us down that path.
00:44:39.884 - 00:45:14.362, Speaker E: I think also after the hackathon. I mean, even before we were announced, actually, it was really just, I think there's this hunger from investors and just other people in the space looking at things coming out of Solana. As soon as we put up our Twitter account, we had a few people reach out and try to get in touch with us just to hear more about what we were doing. And, you know, from those conversations, these, everyone's so open to making connections left and right. And so that helped with a lot of, like, I mean, we're engineers. Like, we live in the weeds. Like, I don't know, lawyers.
00:45:14.362 - 00:45:42.264, Speaker E: Like, who the hell do I talk to, right? So, you know, you ask 1520 people that reached out to you about, you know, wanting to hear more about your project, potentially investing or doing whatever, and the Solana team and everyone, you get a handful and you can see who is well recommended and all that stuff. So a lot of those tough questions that come by leveraging the community and the interest that is in this community.
00:45:46.884 - 00:46:28.904, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we've taken a lot of time over the past two years to really do our best to cultivate this welcoming, helpful community and really striving to empower the folks that are within it to be able to do what they did, which is help you guys directly after you won. So that's awesome to hear that it was that seamless. So, really coming up on time here, folks are still popping, questions in, the audience continues to grow. But I guess, Taylor, Tommy, any words of advice, words of wisdom for folks that are just going to jump in here and start launching a product? Like, what were the, what were the two biggest lessons that you learned that could save some folks some time here?
00:46:30.644 - 00:46:58.380, Speaker D: I mean, I think the biggest one is definitely design. You know, try to design a protocol ahead of time. I think we've refactored ours twice now, maybe. And, you know, each, each refactor takes, you know, takes a fair bit of time. And I think we could have been a little further along if we, you know, sat down and really thought through it for a couple of days before just digging in. But at the same time, right, like, when you're trying to learn, you know, a new. A new system, new language, whatnot, you know, sometimes jumping in is just the best thing.
00:46:58.380 - 00:47:06.704, Speaker D: So, like, definitely don't wait till the end of the hackathon to start building. Start building. But if you have the time, you know, make sure you design things ahead of time.
00:47:10.444 - 00:47:27.182, Speaker E: Yeah. And then I'd say the biggest thing we learned being engineers is we kind of had someone who was like, hey, you guys should launch a Twitter account. Mango markets just did that, like, and they're getting serious traction. I think you could do well, too. And so then we're, like, scrambling. Like, oh, man, we got to find a look. Like all that was put on the fly.
00:47:27.182 - 00:48:23.454, Speaker E: We asked, like, everyone who was involved or even remotely just associated with our project. Like, what should we name this thing? Like, our repo is Solana options. Like, you know, we didn't come up with, like, it was all put together on the spot. You know, people love the name now and have commended us on it, but, like, it was all pulled together very quickly just to be like, oh, man, there's another project that launched a Twitter account. And, I mean, not being marketers and being engineers, like, and then doing that and seeing it firsthand, it's, like, tremendously valuable. Like, the amount of feedback you get, you know, we have people posting what kind of Uis they want to see now. And the earlier you can foster that community and show some traction, I think it'll pay dividends down the road as we can now start pulling, you know, pulling some developers that we're talking to that want to get involved and pulling contributors and pulling designers, and we pulled some from the community, start running our twitter because, I mean, we have no idea what the hell we're doing.
00:48:23.454 - 00:48:31.414, Speaker E: But, yeah, definitely get started on that. I know everyone's mentioned that, but as engineers, we kind of forget that sometimes.
00:48:31.834 - 00:48:51.194, Speaker B: Yeah, if it keeps coming up, it's a very important point, so can't stress enough if you're not an engineer, if you're into marketing, you're in the community, you're into business development, even if you just make badass memes, like, apply, like, there's a space for you in these teams. And so just really, it's a really wide net.
00:48:51.494 - 00:49:15.540, Speaker E: These teams probably don't even have, like, the ability for to apply, and some of them probably don't even know that they need it. So, like, don't be afraid to, like, you know, reach out. And don't just say when. Token, when airdrop, when whatever. Like, and don't just say, hey, I'm here to volunteer. I want to do whatever, like, actually give, like, what you can do. And, like, you know, because there's so much interest in these communities and so much, you know, just messages flying back and forth.
00:49:15.540 - 00:49:25.828, Speaker E: But if you write out, like, hey, this is what I can help with and be specific and detailed, like, you'll get a response, like, much better than if you're just saying random stuff or just saying, hey, I want to help.
00:49:25.876 - 00:49:29.932, Speaker B: Like, there's so much, right? Like, yeah, or just start.
00:49:29.988 - 00:49:30.636, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.
00:49:30.700 - 00:49:42.016, Speaker A: I think this is a little known story, but Dominic, our head of BD, like, started in our telegram. He was just a guy, like, ghetto cryptos. This is telegram handle.
00:49:42.040 - 00:49:42.344, Speaker B: And he.
00:49:42.384 - 00:50:07.780, Speaker A: And, you know, we were inundated, and in, like, 2018, thousands of people were coming into the group, and we just kept seeing, like, Scott, ghetto crypto is, like, kind of knows what he's talking about. He's answering questions, he's being helpful. He's, like, assembling resources. He's kind of, like, saving Anatoly's time. And, I mean, it took a day before I got him on the phone. I was like, dude, I want to hire you. Like, where are, where do you live? What do you do now? Drop it and get in here.
00:50:07.780 - 00:50:18.984, Speaker A: And, you know, that was his entry into, you know, being full time at Solana. He's been here for three years. That that's immediately the easiest way to show value and show that you know what you're doing.
00:50:22.644 - 00:50:24.344, Speaker E: Yeah, couldn't agree more.
00:50:26.084 - 00:50:56.622, Speaker C: Yeah, just start, start helping and kind of, you know, don't, don't hesitate to talk to people. I think, like, just starting those conversations and talking to folks is, like, the first step. Um. I I, uh. I guess what do you guys would like to see in this hackathon as, like, your. As, like, builders in the space, um, and, like, in the eco. So you guys kind of hit it.
00:50:56.678 - 00:51:16.860, Speaker E: Uh, for what I like is kind of in my mind, like, long term, like, the dao functionality. Like, that's. And talking to some of the other teams or, like, projects that have come out and are further along and, like, launching our own stuff, like, at the end of the day, right, we built this for our own needs, but it's not something that, like, we're going to, you know, it's not solely for us. It's for the world.
00:51:16.892 - 00:51:17.012, Speaker D: Right.
00:51:17.028 - 00:51:38.374, Speaker E: It's for the community. And so we want this to be fully decentralized and, you know, uncensored and all that kind of stuff. So we're all talking about it, but we're all really focused on our projects currently. So, like, start trying to figure out how to architect that and build that for something that all these projects can use will be super valuable.
00:51:39.874 - 00:52:08.594, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a governance kind of reference implementation that's been in the works in the Solana program, library, repo. So if you guys want to, like, if anyone's just thinking, how do I build a really slick governance UI that could be like a project that requires less rust and more design, more ux kind of iteration. And I think that would be immensely helpful to the entire community.
00:52:10.574 - 00:52:18.726, Speaker D: Yeah. And to add something else, I also think there's other projects off chain. Like, I think it was Raj I mentioned, like, doing analytics on Solana.
00:52:18.870 - 00:52:20.118, Speaker E: I think there's a lot of stuff.
00:52:20.166 - 00:52:40.274, Speaker D: Around the data that could be done right. So just making it easier to read historical transactions, logs, whatever, you know, I think that's super valuable for the entire community just because it can showcase more of how Solana is interacting with what projects get traction and things like that.
00:52:44.334 - 00:53:04.168, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think. I think with that, we're already over time. But I would love to just kind of wrap this up with, with a few last words. Raj, Toli, anything you want to share with everyone that's watching? This has been amazing. Thank you, everyone who's joined us for this. This is just the first of many events.
00:53:04.168 - 00:53:24.984, Speaker B: So if you want to stay tuned to all the upcoming events, make sure that you're following the Solana on twitch. This is going to kind of be our home base for events for the next couple weeks. We're going to test this out and see how it goes. So if you want to be involved with everything there, make sure you're following here. I think before we jump out, Raj, toli, anything you want to share with the people watching?
00:53:25.104 - 00:53:40.244, Speaker A: Yeah, I just want to reiterate something that you guys said earlier, like, you didn't know Russ, really, before working on Solana, you learned it as part of building on Solana. Right. And you participated in the first hackathon as well.
00:53:40.824 - 00:53:41.604, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:53:42.824 - 00:54:18.018, Speaker A: So this, like, this is not a one and done thing. The hackathon is not, you know, like an event where you come try it out and then, you know, just give up. It's. Everyone is an opportunity to grow and learn and plug into the community more, get past that next hump, whatever that hump is. Take vacation, take off work, quit your job, just like, just dive in and I promise it'll work out. And, you know, if it doesn't work out on this hackathon or if you don't find your footing, like, just get started, there will be enough. There will always be hackathons, right? So get started, get ahead, and just keep working.
00:54:18.018 - 00:54:26.974, Speaker A: The hackathons are just a place to showcase, you know, what you've been doing and drive it to a point and force yourself to get over the hump.
00:54:28.434 - 00:54:32.134, Speaker C: Not financial advice, not career advice.
00:54:35.154 - 00:54:54.404, Speaker B: But really, that one of the other projects tweeted something out that yesterday they were like, we. I think it was like we dropped out of school and just went all in. Like, haven't looked back since. And internally we were like, wow, like, that's wild. Like, that's so cool to see. Toli, do you have anything, anything you want to add?
00:54:57.264 - 00:55:54.458, Speaker C: Yeah, I've never seen, like, this kind of, like, crazy amount of development and smart people coming into crypto as this is like a bigger cycle than 2018. It seems like Internet, when the Internet was built in the nineties, we seeing the same cycles repeat here, but they're even bigger because we now have this super connect. We have the Internet across the entire world, and everything is happening much, much faster. I couldn't think of a more leveraged, bigger opportunity for a couple people to know how to code, to go build the next thing, the next global financial thing, the next global social thing. It's crazy. It's pretty wild. So get excited and take those big ideas and just go test them out and see what happens.
00:55:54.458 - 00:56:01.454, Speaker C: And it may take a couple times, you may build the worst possible implementation, but that thing, that's what takes off.
00:56:05.574 - 00:56:47.474, Speaker B: And we can't stress enough that Solana is here just to provide the infrastructure, like, to provide the foundation for these projects. And really, the growth of the network comes from everyone in the audience right now. Like, folks like the side options team, like Taylor and Tommy, the ones that are deploying these projects, that are actually utilizing the infrastructure and scaling to the now millions of users. And so, like, this is really all because of you all. And so, so, thank you to everyone who's participated in past hackathon, thank you to everyone who's joined us for this stream. Thanks everyone who's been a community member and has been hanging with us for the past couple of years. It's been a hell of a ride, and things are really only growing stronger from here.
00:56:47.474 - 00:56:57.794, Speaker B: So I think with that, I don't have anything else. Taylor, Tommy, before you kick off, anything you want to say to the folks watching, just happy hacking.
00:56:58.214 - 00:56:59.646, Speaker E: Yeah, well, happy hacking.
00:56:59.670 - 00:57:19.554, Speaker D: But I will say one other thing. Just because there's something out there that's built, developed, deployed, similar to your idea, I would not let that deter you from building the same thing. There's going to be different implementations. I know it's pretty daunting seeing another protocol doing something similar. Just build.
00:57:21.974 - 00:57:23.798, Speaker B: Don't let the Twitter trolls get to you.
00:57:23.846 - 00:58:15.818, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. The similarities really end at the idea because, like, just every, every path, like, every decision that you make, you're going to make, you know, 100 decisions that are. That are just going to take you down a totally different path than somebody else. And even if the protocols are, you know, similar, like, once you actually get to that product iteration phase where you have your own customers, you will start kind of building your own thing, and you may end up that your competitor and you decide to share code because it's easier and better and more secure that way. But you've already established your own products and everything else, and it's no longer like us versus them and more collaborative. That's something that has been really amazing to see about serum.
00:58:15.818 - 00:58:33.344, Speaker C: You look at radium and serum and the success both of those projects had working together and sharing liquidity and, like, combining kind of, you know, code bases in a way, something like that is pretty rare anywhere else, even on Ethereum.
00:58:37.444 - 00:58:48.028, Speaker B: Yeah, completely. Oh, Raj dipped off again. Okay, so I think with that, we're back. And I think what that was.
00:58:48.076 - 00:58:49.624, Speaker A: Sorry, I had to sneeze.
00:58:51.694 - 00:59:22.498, Speaker B: With that. I think we're going to call it. So thanks again for everyone who's hung out with us for the past hour, there will be plenty more of these. We have a stacked event scheduled for you all. We will be bringing in a ton of really high quality speakers to bring you all as much value as we possibly can. We're going to have fireside chats where Tolle and some folks that are significantly smarter than me go into really technical deep dives. We're going to do some workshops where some of the engineers on our team are going to walk you through kind of everything you need to know to get started.
00:59:22.498 - 00:59:54.620, Speaker B: We have some panels on investing, panels on defi, panels on nfts. We're going to be bringing some of our ecosystem projects to talk about what they're building and a ton more. So once again, Solana.com hackathon will direct you to the most current hackathon page, which is the Solana season page. From there, you can see all the judges speakers. You can apply for the hackathon, and you can also view the event schedule. But really, the easiest way to stay up to date once going to run is making sure you're following Solana on twitch.
00:59:54.620 - 01:00:02.004, Speaker B: And I think with that, we're going to kick it out of here. So thank you all so much for joining, and everyone have a great day or evening.
