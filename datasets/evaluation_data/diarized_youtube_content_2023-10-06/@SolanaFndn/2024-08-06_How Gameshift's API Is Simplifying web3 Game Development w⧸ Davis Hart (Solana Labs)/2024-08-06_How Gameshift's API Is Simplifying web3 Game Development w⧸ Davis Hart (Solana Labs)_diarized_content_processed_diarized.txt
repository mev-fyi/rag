00:00:05.040 - 00:00:06.650, Speaker A: Davis, welcome to Validated.
00:00:07.310 - 00:00:08.654, Speaker B: Thanks. Great to be here.
00:00:08.782 - 00:00:26.910, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to get into a bunch of stuff today. Let's talk about games, games infrastructure. We're talking in part because you guys over at Solana Labs a few months ago launched Gameshift. So tell us a little bit about what Gameshift actually is.
00:00:27.070 - 00:01:11.960, Speaker B: Yeah, at a high level. Gameshift is a single API service that helps games build on top of Solana. When we started working on this project over a year ago, we just realized that it was still very difficult for any game developer that wanted to use Solana to get integrated with all the basics that they would need. Wallets and assets and payments marketplaces. There are great vendors that provide individual services, but we felt like there was nothing that tied that together in a really easy to consume package. That's what game shift is. The way I like to describe it to games developers is that we're a blockchain backend service for the game, and this allows the developer to focus on their game in the traditional infrastructure they normally use.
00:01:11.960 - 00:01:18.488, Speaker B: And then on the backend they integrate with us and we provide all of those features that they need to do anything they need on Solana.
00:01:18.664 - 00:01:31.220, Speaker A: Yeah. So talk a little bit about what that interface layer looks like, because people have been building blockchain based games for a while, but a lot of them have had to develop their own infrastructure to actually talk to the underlying blockchain.
00:01:31.960 - 00:02:17.350, Speaker B: Yeah, we actually approach this a little bit different than some of the other solutions that have been in the market outside of Solana in the past. We take a very traditional approach in terms of how we deliver the product. So we're actually providing a rest based API, and what that means is we're essentially intermediating from the game and the chain. So we're in between. It's a little bit different than other approaches that might connect the client directly on chain. There's a project in Solana called Magic Block that helps with that, and it's great for certain use cases. There's other approaches that orchestrate on chain deployment of programs on behalf of the game developer, but then the developer has to maintain their own keys and maintain control and management of all of those programs.
00:02:17.350 - 00:03:12.292, Speaker B: That's a different approach that has its trade offs. We picked this intermediated approach because we think it is the most simple approach for the average developer. It requires the least amount of blockchain knowledge, it requires the least amount of key management, blockchain programming, rust programming, any of that. We really wanted to provide the greatest flexibility for ourselves to serve the existing Solana community of game developers, which are pretty facile when it comes to Solana. But we really wanted to be able to welcome game developers that are blockchain aware, blockchain interest, and maybe on other chains, and then in the future to really go convince traditional gaming studios to take blockchain seriously. And we think the way to do that is to give them an answer that looks very familiar to any other infrastructure they're using, say for cloud services or if they're using a payments provider. Our interface is going to look very similar to that.
00:03:12.476 - 00:03:26.960, Speaker A: Yeah. So what are they in a traditional model without something like game shift, what are developers having to actually build? And talk a little bit about how that abstraction layer actually makes it easier for a game developer to do something like mint an NFT or move a token.
00:03:27.380 - 00:04:13.400, Speaker B: So if you're building a game today and you want to, I like your examples, you want to mint an NFT. The approach today is you, without any help from a vendor, you would have to go figure out how to use whatever the right NFT standard is. As an aside, we can talk later about how standards get set in Solana, which is a little different than in other environments. And so you have to decide, am I using the Metaplex NFT standard? Am I using core, am I using compressed, am I using pnfts, xnfts? These are all exist, these are all things. So first you have to go understand that. And lets just say the documentation for some of these things is not great. So you have to go understand that, figure out how to implement it, deploy the relevant programs, create all the accounts, et cetera.
00:04:13.400 - 00:04:42.870, Speaker B: And in order to do that, you have to find your RPC provider. And so you're starting to get into a world where you need rust development experience. You need to understand how the Solana blockchain works in the architecture. You need to find RPC providers in this on chain, off chain infrastructure. So that's one approach. The other approach is you go find a vendor that can provide that particular service. So you might work with a cross mint, for example, and that will be more of a traditional API approach.
00:04:42.870 - 00:05:02.496, Speaker B: But you go down that path and you solve for that particular need. And then let's say you get that done. Now you're thinking, okay, well, now I'd like to go do a fungible token, go repeat that entire process all over again. And then now you have a, another implementation that sits alongside your nfts and so on, right?
00:05:02.608 - 00:05:08.700, Speaker A: And so like, how are people actually using this today? Like what games are actually built on top of gameshift?
00:05:09.480 - 00:05:37.578, Speaker B: Yeah, so we have a couple of games I could talk about. So the first would be earth from another sun, which is a galactic lunar shooter rpg game. They've been working on the game for about two and a half years before they started doing the blockchain integration. Just a quick background. This is a team that comes from AAA gaming. Theyve been focused on building an amazing game. They always knew they wanted to put blockchain in somewhere, and when they got to that point, they looked around, they decided they wanted to be on Solana.
00:05:37.578 - 00:06:03.922, Speaker B: They came to us and so now theyre integrating with us. Theyre using a whole host of features with us. So theyre going to do token incentives with Gameshift. Theyll have a token for the game. They it's an rpg, so it's a resource economy. So they're going to mint and manage all of their resources, both semi fungibles and non fungible tokens, representing their resources with us. They're going to be doing crafting marketplaces.
00:06:03.922 - 00:06:06.750, Speaker B: They're going to connect all that through to fiat payments.
00:06:07.410 - 00:06:19.270, Speaker A: And so like their work of actually integrating this, what did this look like using game shift versus if they'd done it natively or if they'd gone and actually had no web3 component to this at all.
00:06:20.380 - 00:07:14.600, Speaker B: With us, they come and they worked with us to come up with their integration design. In terms of actually building with us, it looked like start with the user registration API and then you just start plugging everything in after that. It's all designed to work really nicely together, as you would expect out of a stripe or anything like this. They could have gone down one of these other paths we've talked about before. Uh, they were looking at do we hire one or two additional engineers just to do the blockchain integration? And for an early stage games team, that's a huge amount of spend. It's also a huge amount of distraction away from the core game, which this team is really focused on because they're really wanting to build a high quality gaming experience, first and foremost. So for them, spending more resources and time on the blockchain integration internally would actually distract from what they're trying to build.
00:07:15.020 - 00:07:25.560, Speaker A: So for teams like that that are sort of trying to decide what blockchain do I build a game on, how are they going about making that decision and how did these guys end up choosing Solana?
00:07:26.500 - 00:07:46.900, Speaker B: I think for games teams, what they're looking at that's most important in the blockchain choice is technology it's the potential to acquire players, it's the broader set of ecosystem activities that are going on. And then the fourth is what types of integration partners they can find that makes the job easier.
00:07:47.020 - 00:07:47.684, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:47.852 - 00:08:22.960, Speaker B: To go back through those. So on the technology side, it comes down to a lot of things that we know being deeply in Solana, transaction speed, block times, throughput. I think Solana, its a very easy comparison to make with Solana. That ones pretty easy. Then it comes down to how big is the player base in the ecosystem. Games are looking towards blockchains as sort of de facto distribution channels. They sort of think that if they can get into the ecosystem, that players will discover them more easily.
00:08:22.960 - 00:09:15.360, Speaker B: I don't know how true that is, but that's the belief that's out there. And then beyond that, there's the question of, well, what is the broader set of economic activities or user activities that are going on in this ecosystem? I think by way of example, what's really exciting about Solana that teams are definitely interested in working in, is you think about gaming and what are the adjacencies alongside gaming. DeFi is certainly one for a certain set of players and game types. And so having a robust DeFi ecosystem is actually helpful for a game that wants to plug into that kind of player mentality or that kind of infrastructure. So if token trading is part of the game, that's a very natural adjacency. The other adjacency that has become really popular in the last, call it, 612 months is the meme coin world. And meme coins are so pure in their use case that they are kind of games in and of themselves.
00:09:15.360 - 00:10:06.850, Speaker B: And so I see a lot of teams looking at Solana and getting excited about the opportunity to work with those meme coin communities and provide new activities around that meme coin. And in a way, this is extremely complementary. Sorry to take a quick aside on this point, because I think its actually really important. When I first got into crypto a number of years ago, this is when we still had this narrative of game asset interoperability, which frankly, we just havent seen. That hasnt evolved. And I think for some very good business reasons, that hasnt happened, and I dont know that it will. Meme coins are different though, because a meme coin, once it gets past that initial hump of adoption, that team is welcoming of any other opportunities to drive value and excitement around the token.
00:10:06.850 - 00:10:34.570, Speaker B: In the case of a bonk or a whiff, having games come into Solana and give bonk holders whiff holders an opportunity to do something in that game with their token, with other token holders. This is a great compliment. And so I think there's a growing opportunity for meme coins and games to work more together. The community aspect of all of the other things that are going on in Solana or on chain that do motivate games teams in their choice.
00:10:35.310 - 00:11:00.760, Speaker A: So the sort of community into game flow and funnel was something that a lot of the NFT projects thought they were going to be able to build back in 21 or 22. But I think what we saw is very, very few NFT projects that set out to build a game actually ended up building anything that we really call a game. So why do you think there's a more natural fit there between meme coins and sort of what was tried last cycle?
00:11:01.140 - 00:11:30.352, Speaker B: Yeah, well, a number of things come to mind. So in no particular order. First, with the NFT communities, those were often minted with like a ten k mint or whatever the number is. And so you're sort of limited from the get go as to the distribution of your community, how big it can be. So you get people that go to the mint and they buy ten or 100 or 200 of these things. So you ultimately, you ultimately only have so many holders that can actually do things. So that's one problem.
00:11:30.456 - 00:11:31.024, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:31.152 - 00:12:42.876, Speaker B: I think the other is the NFT communities. In order for an NFT to really turn into a game, that's a big leap in terms of developing all of the content, the lore around whatever that original NFT was built on the. And so you have to do a lot more to take an NFT into a game than to sort of harness the excitement around a meme coin and sort of give those holders something to do with it. And I think the third is meme coins because they have bigger distribution. And maybe this is also a timing aspect because the NFTs into games is kind of a narrative from a couple of years ago, and here we are now. But I think with the greater distribution in meme coins and the fact that the fun of the meme coins is the trading and is the price, thats the points of the game of meme coins, I think theres just a lot more energy around them than I saw with some of these smaller NFT communities that have these ideas about becoming games. And maybe the last point is the way you frame the question I actually think is worth coming back to, which is some of these NFT communities said were going to do this mint and then we're going to build a game around it.
00:12:42.876 - 00:13:18.560, Speaker B: I don't think any of the meme coins ever said that. And I don't think that that's largely what their strategy is. What I see are games coming in, and we have a couple of games we're working with right now that are building, say, tournament features where you can compete with other players, but you compete under the banner of your chosen meme coin. And then you could do all these really cool dynamics of like, if you're playing for Whiff and I'm playing for Bong and I win, I get your whiff and I automatically sell it and then buy bog. So my winning in the game against you creates sell pressure on whiff and buy pressure on bonk. And that just plays into the game of the meme coins.
00:13:18.680 - 00:13:47.020, Speaker A: Right. So blockchain games are sort of something that's been talked about for probably four or five years at this point, as an industry that's kind of about to break open. And it always feels like there's one or two things missing, and that's sort of been the narrative over the last few years. So where actually are we in the sort of breakout game cycle moment? We kind of keep being told is coming soon. And why do you think it has not happened yet?
00:13:49.920 - 00:14:58.160, Speaker B: For me, it comes back to game quality. And actually, before I even say that, it's probably worth segmenting a little bit, I think there have been successes in web3 gaming. For web3 players, it's a small niche. Games that are more trading oriented, can be successful and have been successful, but it's just not been in a scale that's gotten the attention outside of web3. And I think even folks that are in web3, they're looking at that and they see those things as sort of trading games, not as games. Yeah, and so that's really the point here, is we're still waiting for the quality games to come that are built as fun games first and then successfully leverage web3 infrastructure for their asset economy or for something interesting around tournaments or payments and some of the other things that we see that are really nascent in user generated content or on chain gaming. There was a big investment cycle in games in 2021, 2022, and started at the beginning of 23.
00:14:58.160 - 00:15:27.644, Speaker B: For a team like going back to Earth, window of the sun, this is a team that has been funded for a couple of years. They've been building for a couple of years. That's the scale on which you have to invest and build these kinds of really high quality games. And so I think it's a matter of seeing some of those projects launch, which is supposed to be happening this year. EfAs, for example, is coming in q three, q four. We've seen a number of other names like Jungle just announced they're coming to Solana. I think that's an exciting project.
00:15:27.644 - 00:16:10.444, Speaker B: Parallel is coming to Solana. That's an interesting project that has some success. So I think it starts with that game quality first. But then the second thing that these teams need to demonstrate is sustainability around the on chain components. One of the things I see changing is six months ago teams were rushing to launch tokens, teams that were working with. Now they're starting to experiment with more ring fenced economies in the game that they will open over time as they feel confident they can manage those economies. So I think we may see games get a little bit slower in how they put things on chain in order to avoid the boom and bust that we've seen in the past.
00:16:10.444 - 00:16:23.628, Speaker B: Because once one of the. Once that cycle happens for your game, you're kind of done right. And so you have to be super careful in rolling out the web3 component of at least like the on chain price, discovery, liquidity, et cetera, around your game assets.
00:16:23.764 - 00:16:37.752, Speaker A: Yeah. So with game shifts and other tools that exist today, like what dynamics and what type of games are kind of easiest or best to build on blockchain today, and what are the classes of games that maybe the tooling isn't quite there yet.
00:16:37.936 - 00:17:07.470, Speaker B: So I think today there's a whole host of games that probably don't make sense to do anything on chain. Probably a lot of single player games, just. It's a little harder to see. So first and foremost, I think you have to look at games that are trying to do something. They're either a multiplayer game or I do think that we're seeing a lot of. A lot of development in the tournament, real money gaming space where you can take single player games and you can actually kind of create a multiplayer experience. But multiplayer, some element of multiplayer probably has to happen.
00:17:07.470 - 00:18:02.214, Speaker B: So far, web3 has demonstrated that any game with a rich asset economy makes sense to do on chain. So RPG's are really good for this. I think on the other end of the spectrum, where we're still waiting for more technology potentially would be getting more towards fully on chain games. I do think that an on chain game, meaning where you're putting your full game state and game logic on chain, you have no backend game server, or if you do, it's not the authoritative source of truth. I do think that opens some very interesting use cases, particularly around guilds and around open modding. That's a very exciting space. But frankly, even Solana probably doesn't have the technicals out of the box that are necessary to fully enable those kinds of games.
00:18:02.214 - 00:18:34.416, Speaker B: You look at Star Atlas fully on Gene game and Solana, I think, I don't know the stats on top of my head, but I think six months ago they represented something like, I want to say, 20% of all transaction volume. I mean, if so, if you have five star atlases, you crash Solana. So we need to get beyond that. There's some interesting projects in Solana. I don't know if you want to call them l, two s or side chains, that may solve some of this, but there's a whole host of infrastructure that if we really want to move into on chain games, that has to get built. Those are, I think, are the two ends of the spectrum. The space is in the middle, right.
00:18:34.416 - 00:18:43.560, Speaker B: We're starting to work our way across that space. But the ends of the spectrum, I think, really exemplify what really can work easily and what's really still needs a lot more development.
00:18:43.720 - 00:18:52.540, Speaker A: Yeah. Does something like game shift work with the onboarding component too? Or is it really just interfaces with the blockchain for calls?
00:18:53.390 - 00:18:54.678, Speaker B: Onboarding of whom?
00:18:54.854 - 00:19:03.094, Speaker A: User side of. So I sign up to use a game. There's a whole process of having to create wallets and other types of infrastructure to support that.
00:19:03.262 - 00:19:56.924, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. We build in embedded wallets. So our approach to this is kind of like a stripe for Solana in the sense that we support games bringing players that maybe already have wallets, so we can connect to existing wallets, but then we also support embedded wallets. We work with a company called Metakeep, which is in the Solana ecosystem to provide embedded wallets so the game can sign a user up and provision a wallet silently for that user, and then later when it's time for that user to approve a transaction. These are non custodial wallets. There is a web based flow for them to approve, where the security and non custodial nature is preserved through the way that Metakeep has implemented the approval approval flow. And I think for us, we think about, it's not just onboarding, it's the whole player experience, where some games want to make that player experience very accessible for many different kinds of players.
00:19:56.924 - 00:20:57.734, Speaker B: And so one way we do that is not just the embedded wallets, but we also support fiat payments, both on the pay in and pay outside. We connect that through on the marketplaces so we do in game branded marketplaces with fiat purchasing built in so you can buy assets off the marketplace using a credit card if you want. And I think that resonates with, with a lot of teams that really want to, out of the gate, be able to serve as many players as they can. The end of the day, gaming is a hyper competitive market and I think the teams that can be successful, the ones that come in with an understanding of the demographic they're going after, and I don't know that demographic is ultimately necessarily going to be like, I just want to serve, you know, web3 players or, or web two players. I think it's more about, hey, my game is attracted to this kind of gamer and that's the kind of person I want to serve. Okay, so I'm going to go find those people. You know, it's people that are interested in a certain type of rpg or people that are interested in this kind of a trading card game.
00:20:57.734 - 00:21:19.928, Speaker B: And so I'm going to go into those communities where people are congregating around that genre, not around web3 or web two. And I'm going to deploy my game. And as they come in, if they want to do the full web3 experience, connect to wallet, pay with soul, whatever that is, game shift can help them support that same time. If that player comes in without any of that stuff, then we can support that player as well.
00:21:20.064 - 00:21:39.060, Speaker A: Yeah. So gameshift is your typical, let's call it for profit, SaaS style product. Out of all of the scope of things that slant labs could have chosen to build, what was it about this market and this product opportunity that was worth building out a whole product suite for?
00:21:40.080 - 00:22:36.180, Speaker B: I think it started with a philosophy and a belief around games as a core use case for web3. When we talk about games that have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of players transacting globally with assets of value, that really makes sense to do on chain doing that in the web two domain. Some of my background has been in payments. You just do payments is incredibly complicated, let alone everything else you have to do for marketplaces, etcetera. It started with a thesis and unbelief that this is a great use case for not just blockchain, but specifically for Solana. We're Solana Labs, so we're going to look first and foremost, okay, what is Solana predisposed for and what can we do? Well, so that's really what drove the development here. And then the next step was to look at, well, is the ecosystem well served with infrastructure providers today.
00:22:36.180 - 00:23:28.884, Speaker B: And what we identified was there was good vertical providers that could do, say, payments, that could do a marketplace that could do wallets, but no one was really tying those all together and deploying a full package and then committing to expanding that package over time in the way that we have. So that was sort of the gap that we identified. And to your point, Solana Labs is a for profit company. Gameshift is a for profit company. So we are also looking at, is this a space where we can add enough value that theres a revenue potential for the product? We think that were unlocking a lot of value with teams that come in, as I said, they can avoid hiring a full time developer just for blockchain. Thats a huge amount of savings plus the opportunity that we become their web3 consultant. If you were where were keeping tabs on everything thats happening in Solana.
00:23:28.884 - 00:24:06.866, Speaker B: I think as labs were well positioned to do that, just given our history and the people we have on the team, we're keeping tabs on everything that's going on and we're building into the product over time we think are the most interesting web3 enabled use cases. So just by way of example, we're working on real money gaming and tournament management now. Uh, I've been spending a lot of time with, you know, foundation and folks in the gaming space talking about, hey, what's the role of salon actions and blinks? You know, how do we use those in games? Are there some interesting use cases and token 22? Right. There's a whole bunch of opportunities there. How much of those to games? And so as we identify those, test them, then we'll bring them into the product.
00:24:07.018 - 00:24:38.710, Speaker A: So the sort of thing you've been describing here of like there's a product need here that wasn't being served kind of in the market. What sort of convinced you that there was a big market for this, though? Because I think probably a few years ago, there were a bunch of game infrastructure companies across many different blockchains that were getting built, and none of them really caught on at the time. So what changed between the market of 2021 and the market of 2023 that something like game shift was needed.
00:24:39.090 - 00:25:30.276, Speaker B: So I think the difference from 21 to 23 is the breadth of what people were trying to do or even what was theoretically possible for web3 and gaming 2021. I mean, that was still like basically defi summer, NFT summer. That was the focus. And so the set of features that you could provide from an infrastructure perspective was pretty narrow. And frankly, I think at that time, those features would have been and even at that time were commodities, right? NfT minting is not the most difficult value add thing to provide. Its important and its not trivial, but it becomes commoditized pretty quickly. And if you dont have a breadth of things you can go do, then you can't provide this better together value, you can't continue to expand the breadth of your services.
00:25:30.276 - 00:26:16.276, Speaker B: So I think that that's a major difference where now we've got better infrastructure, we have better infrastructure around payments, we have many different asset types. Some of the things I mentioned about like tournaments, real money gaming. So there's more that you can do here where there's a bigger space for someone like us to provide value. I think the other thing that has changed is the narrative around gaming. And I think what the ecosystem is expecting out of gaming has evolved beyond those first experiments which were very NFT based, that were very play to earn based. And we've seen people trying many different types of economic models in gaming. Some that use tokens, some that don't, some that are more focused on competitive aspects, some that aren't.
00:26:16.276 - 00:26:50.624, Speaker B: And so theres hopefully more opportunities to find what really works and then scale up from there. Admittedly, web3 gaming as a percentage of overall gaming is roughly 1%. And in a sense that is both the opportunity. But its also leads to the question of, well, when that we talked about earlier, we happen to have a belief that this will connect for us and for the teams we work with. The question is, okay, how do we maximize the amount of time that we have and how do we take as many shots on goal to figure out what those things are going to be?
00:26:50.792 - 00:27:18.870, Speaker A: Yeah, so the teams that are coming to you now and saying, hey, we want to use this, we want to build this stuff on Solana. What is those conversations like? Is this sort of more of a, are they approaching you saying, we don't really know much about blockchain, but we want to have some blockchain component to this game, so we want to use this tooling? Or are these folks who are saying, hey, we've pretty much already decided we're going to build on Solana, but this just makes it easier for us to do something we were already going to do.
00:27:20.290 - 00:27:55.580, Speaker B: It's a mix. Teams that come to us, if they come to us, they found us because they at least knew enough about blockchain to understand that, hey, there's this thing called Solana so on. So we don't really run into teams that are saying, hey, we don't know anything about blockchain, but let's work together. So there's always some degree of awareness. I think from there it spans a spectrum. There's two dimensions here. There's what do they want to do on chain? And then the question is how do they want to do it? I think the how do they want to do it we talked about earlier.
00:27:55.580 - 00:29:03.420, Speaker B: They are looking at options and they see how game shift fits relative to say, hey, I'm going to build my own or I'm going to go put together a bunch of vendors. So that's, I think, pretty clear to get through the variation in what we see of what people want to do on chain. I think the bookends would be on one end you have teams that come and they're looking at taking a game model and bringing the asset aspects of the game on chains. RPG's are a nice example where it's pretty clear how you take an rpg from web two to web3. We run into some just great teams to work with. There's some names I wish I could share that we haven't announced yet, but there's a couple of teams that we're working with that are coming more from the web3 background and they're very fun to work with because they're really thinking about how do they take some of the true web3 degeneracy that happens around tokens and bring that into a game. And I think it's just fun to ideate on those initiatives because it just represents a different way of playing games that just kind of breaks the mold and so that can be very fun.
00:29:03.420 - 00:29:46.998, Speaker B: Beyond that, we do occasionally talk to teams that ultimately decide to go and build their own because they want to do a lot of custom stuff on chain. And I think thats super important because those are the teams that then we follow to figure out, okay, what more should we be building through that process? We identified, hey, we need to have an on chain rewards program that can reward players for committing tokens over time. And then they do things in game and with all of that combined they get access to rewards in game or on chain. And we identify that because we saw that happening in a lot of games. So those teams that are outside the scope of game shift because they want to build their own, because they want something more complex, those become the people we follow and we watch and we.
00:29:47.014 - 00:30:16.650, Speaker A: Look for inspiration from nice and the actual components themselves. You mentioned that this handles the entire process of token management, item creation. Some of that work where people are bringing their own wallets or connecting into embedded wallets. What is the future scope of what gameshift looks to touch look like? Is this the sort of thing where you actually could see other types of blockchain specific tooling needed for enabling other types of game use cases?
00:30:17.310 - 00:31:04.724, Speaker B: So there's a couple of things I mentioned, tournaments and real money gaming. I think that's a natural use case for web3, because anytime we're talking about moving value around globally, you really have to. It's typically a natural fit for this technology. So managing a real money tournament, entry fees, prize pools, commissions, all that kind of stuff, doing that on chain is a natural fit for not just the infrastructure, but also for some of the players that are in the space. If they're going from trading meme coins, it's pretty natural for them to also throw a couple of dollars in to play a game. Beyond that, as I mentioned, we're looking at things like Blinks and Token 22. That's more technical driven.
00:31:04.724 - 00:31:45.638, Speaker B: There are opportunities to use those technologies for more user acquisitions. Blinks is potentially an interesting way to go out and acquire players and really break the silo between a game and the rest of the world by putting that blink that can render on a different platform. Beyond that, some of the things that we're looking at come more from what some of the teams are doing on chain. So what happens if you do publish your player profile, your leaderboards, that sort of thing on chain? This is more sort of research oriented for us, but gets into the spaces of player identity and reputation, potentially some distribution potential, open modding, that kind of thing.
00:31:45.814 - 00:32:12.120, Speaker A: So you mentioned something interesting there, which are like money based games, which gets a little bit closer to betting than the traditional blockchain games market's been in. But obviously sports betting and other types of online gambling are quite profitable and dominate the real world of sports as well. So do you see this as an area of expansion for game shift tooling as well for those type of more overtly financial games?
00:32:13.300 - 00:32:54.248, Speaker B: Potentially. So I think in the space of real money games, there's, in my mind, roughly speaking, there's three major categories. There's single player games of skill. So this is like what skills build. It's a whole company that builds this stuff. Then in the middle, which is where we're focused, would be more competitive multiplayer games that are using real money as either esports, more traditional, rewarding really skilled players with lots of value. I think theres a lot of interesting opportunity of lower dollar or lower value games that really just engage the lizard part of the brain once you have a little bit of money on the line.
00:32:54.248 - 00:33:40.924, Speaker B: And then to your point, theres this third category that gets into the traditional notion of gaming, which is sometimes referred to as gambling. Thats a space that we may get into. Its very early to say because of the regulatory exposure thats there are at least it's fortunate to be able to say this. Being in web3, there are clear regulations in that space, unlike what we do in web3. Normally there are clear regulations in that space. In some places it's easier to do than others, so we'll sort of take that on a case by case basis. But right now we really want to get that middle category launched and I think there's a real opportunity to prove out what you can do when you're talking about having players engaged in a multiplayer game with $0.50,
00:33:40.924 - 00:33:57.988, Speaker B: with a dollar worth of value on the line, where it's not about the money, but it's about the money triggering this emotional response to the game that just makes it much more engrossing. I think that's a whole space that's underexplored. I'm really excited to see what happens in a space and then obviously what we can do to power that.
00:33:58.164 - 00:34:32.920, Speaker A: So over the last year or so, we've seen a huge amount more interest from institutions in building financial products on blockchain and Solana in general, whether that's the launch of new stable coins, real world assets, large financial institutions deciding to build on the network. That's been like a really big new trend over the last probably twelve months or so. How are you seeing more traditional game companies look at blockchain? Is the sort of excitement of 2022 back or are we still waiting for them to pivot back into blockchain?
00:34:33.690 - 00:34:36.714, Speaker B: I think we're still waiting. And I think they're still waiting.
00:34:36.802 - 00:34:37.470, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:38.570 - 00:35:31.432, Speaker B: What I hear when I talk to those companies is on the positive side. Those conversations are more welcomed than they were, say, a year or two years ago. These traditional studios are open to having the conversation, to talking about web3. They don't shut the door on you like they did a year ago, like post FTX, but very clearly they're still saying, hey, we need to see something work at a big enough scale that it starts to make sense for us. I think it's important to understand that the overall gaming industry has been in a bit of state of introspection over the last couple of years. Was this Covid boom in gaming. We were all locked up and the gaming industry did great for a couple of years, but then everyone started to get back out, touching grass, seeing humans again.
00:35:31.432 - 00:36:21.480, Speaker B: And theres been a bit of retrenchment in the gaming industry. I think so far this year theres been, I want to say 100,000 or more layoffs in the gaming industry. And so whats happening I think with these more traditional studios is theyre pulling back. Theyre focusing on the core of what has worked, both from a game dynamic ip user acquisition go to market. Theyre really just focused on whats working and trying to figure out what theyre going to do next. And so where web3 fits into that conversation, theyre completely open to anything, including web3 that shows them a path forward to increasing revenue, increasing revenue per player, increasing player engagement stats, et cetera. But they need to see it happen at a big enough scale that they can imagine scaling it up to where they are.
00:36:21.480 - 00:37:05.042, Speaker B: I mean, were talking about larger gaming studios here. And so a game thats successful with 10,000 maus or 20,000 maus is probably not a big enough scale to get the attention of really anyone in that space. Im thinking that theyre going to need to see sustained like 100,200, 5500 thousand maus before theyll look at something as a potential template for what they can do. When we can get there, theres potentially a big unlock because then maybe we get access to a whole bunch of ip that these games, these game studios just continue to wash, rinse, repeat, and maybe there's a really cool opportunity to layer in web3 with some of that awesome ip and maybe that then becomes really the next step function of web3 enabled gaming.
00:37:05.146 - 00:37:12.938, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, if folks are interested in learning more about gameshift or building on it, where can they go to find out some more info?
