00:00:10.360 - 00:00:50.547, Speaker A: Hello Breakpoint. Great to be here. We're Daniel and Nadine from Obligate and we present you today Margarita Finance. We at Obligate, we issued structured products for quite a long time on chain. And we decided to bring it to a next level with Margarita Finance, while leveraging Obligate's legal and tech capabilities. But before we jump into the presentation, let me ask you a question. Are you bored and tired from choosing between low staking yields or high risk meme coins? If so, I have great news.
00:00:50.547 - 00:01:34.205, Speaker A: With Margarita Finance, you can choose your own risk return profile for your own investment and mix your own yield booster directly on Solana. So why we are doing this? We think Defi needs to grow up. If we look at the tradify world structure, products have a volume of over US$7 trillion as of today. That's a lot. But these products are very complex, not accessible for the crypto community. And these products running on outdated trades rails. So that means the settlement cycles are very long and the fees are very high.
00:01:34.205 - 00:02:18.395, Speaker A: If we look at Defi, we have here the staking yields, which are not very exciting, or we have really high risk, high return products, but also very intransparent. So we decided with Margarita Finance we take the best from both worlds and combine it. So you can choose the quote and trade it directly. Your own investment contract on chain with us. It's your choice. So how will you do that? First you choose your underlying cryptocurrency. This could be Sol, Bitcoin or eth.
00:02:18.395 - 00:02:48.585, Speaker A: Then you decide how spicy your investment should be. So choose your apy. And also what's the lock up period of your investment? You want to have it locked up for one week, one month or three months. And then also you decide how much you want to chip in. It's totally your call. And everything is executed directly on Solana and comes into your wallet. But you know what, enough about the theory.
00:02:48.585 - 00:02:59.825, Speaker A: I would say let's jump into the tool, into Margarita Finance. And our CTO Daniel will show you one trade live here on stage.
00:03:05.015 - 00:03:33.085, Speaker B: Alright, so we're going to choose a new trade here. And I'm on Margarita Finance. I'll be investing 10,000 margarita bucks. And I'm choosing with my very high risk appetite, quite a bit of yield that I'm ready to accept. Today I'm going to go with slightly above 72% that says per annum and I'll be paid back in a week. So I'll earn like 1.5% over that week in yield.
00:03:33.085 - 00:04:28.221, Speaker B: I'm going to be requesting the quote. And in the back end, our trading partner STS Digital is going to price up the new yield booster. And I can tell now for 72% yield per annum, I'm going to be having a barrier at 115 price for SOL, which just means that if SOL stays above $115, I'll get the 10,000 plus yield and I'll, if it falls below the barrier, I'll just get SOL at today's price for the 10k that I put in. But I still get the yield anyway. So it's kind of like dollar cost averaging with last week's price. So I'm going to buy this now. And in the back end, we're now setting up the escrow contract.
00:04:28.221 - 00:05:13.233, Speaker B: We're setting up the structured financial product which is a bilateral agreement between you, the investor and the issuer, STS Digital. And we're setting up also a pay off smart contract which at the end of maturity will, based on an Oracle price, determine if the barrier has been broken and determine what the payout will be. So at maturity based on these parameters, you'll just be paid back one of those two amounts based on what the pricing contract says. And this was the trade already done. I have this in my wallet and I'll be paid back next week. And we have one more slide here.
