00:00:04.240 - 00:00:28.339, Speaker A: Woo. Cool. Hi everyone, my name is Paul Koss and I'm going to share with you today around how Desai decentralized science is kind of breaking ground, putting a flag in the ground on Solana. Actually, some background about me. I've been in crypto since 2016 building, and I used to be an Ethereum maximalist. And so this is my first break point. And I just want to say the incredible energy, the warmth here is absolutely infectious.
00:00:28.339 - 00:01:08.455, Speaker A: So we're really excited to bring scientific research onto Solana. We live in a time of science friction and not science fiction, unfortunately. So the scientists we work with scientists all over the globe and we help them tokenize their research. We create decentralized biotech organizations on chain in fields like longevity, fertility research, and a lot of biohacking communities. And the scientists that we work with often say they spend 80% of their time applying for funding and 20% doing the science. Imagine if you were doing that in software development. Most of the world's scientific talent remains untapped.
00:01:08.455 - 00:01:49.421, Speaker A: So there's scientists all over the world that are essentially just not getting funding for their research. Desai stands for permissionless science. So in D Sci, we really want to connect creators that are scientists with users that are patients that want their products. So we all want to live longer. And what if there was a game that gives users time? We'll actually hear from the next speaker, Brian Johnson, who is super deep into this. But so testing new compounds for longevity literally takes a lifetime. So the question is, what if we could run experiments at the speed of pump fun? So what we've built, it's going live today.
00:01:49.421 - 00:02:13.731, Speaker A: We let people fund, run and trade their own tokenized longevity experiments and they can own the outcomes. So this is Wormbot. We partner with a company called aurobiomedical to do this. They mix different compounds with worms. This is C. Elegans is a test that's often done in biotech. You get automated imaging resulting from that and then computer vision in real time detects the survival rate.
00:02:13.731 - 00:02:55.721, Speaker A: So essentially you get a live stream. And the death and survival rate of these worms takes about 20 days and costs on average $300 to $500 to run an experiment. So we're super excited to introduce pump science. Where you can see on the right is essentially a marketplace of different early stage longevity cocktails or compounds that you can now test live in worm experiments. So let me tell you how it works. So there's a researcher that has a new longevity cocktail idea. You can then list it on pump Science, he can fundraise for that experiment with a bonding curve, or the liquidity that is raised automatically goes in to fund that experiment.
00:02:55.721 - 00:03:46.159, Speaker A: It's then tested in worms, and then you can trade the live data stream on Pump Fun. And so what it does is in essence, this creates prediction markets for early stage biotech experiments. What would come after this? Like, how does this actually work? The next thing would be testing in flies. After that you could run mouse experiments that are now tokenized. And ultimately, if you all take this a step further, you could even apply personal testing so people could safely test longevity compounds on themselves and kind of report the outcomes. So what do these tokens actually represent? Is this a meme token? No. So these tokens actually represent real world IP governance, rights to the underlying compounds, data to the experiments that being traded.
00:03:46.159 - 00:04:37.245, Speaker A: And in the next step, even in the interface that we're building, you could kind of auto deploy a patent around this patent application. Token holders control the treasury management that is raised. They can define the experimental roadmap and help with commercialization of any of the interesting compounds that come out of this. You can imagine kind of direct to consumer place where token holders now get early access to these new longevity compounds and treatments. The first two markets actually went live to trade about, I think, 15 minutes ago. And again, the way that it works is when a market cap on any of these compounds that you saw earlier crosses $10,000 on Pump Fun, then the experiment data is deployed live on Pump Science. So on pump sign, it essentially provides you now with a live stream of how the worms are doing.
00:04:37.245 - 00:05:09.743, Speaker A: Cool. We're launching today. You can already find two markets that are live and deployed. And the hope is really that this empowers biohackers all over the world to begin deploying their own experiments. You could come on Pump Science, you could say, I want this compound to be listed. And then within hours, if you get other people interested in that idea, they can begin trading it live. If you're interested to learn more or connect with our team member, we literally built this in about three weeks.
00:05:09.743 - 00:05:21.815, Speaker A: You can connect with Benji Labo on Twitter. Huge shout out to the Solana foundation that provided us a grant in building this and a huge shout out to our friends at Builders for making this happen. Thank you so much.
