00:07:54.454 - 00:08:14.984, Speaker A: All right, we're live. Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's first event of the Solana season, Hackathon. We were a few minutes late there. Sorry about that. But today we have a really exciting guest joining us for Fireside Chat. We have Kevin Rose, partner, true Ventures, founder of Dig, founder of Zero.
00:08:14.984 - 00:08:20.144, Speaker A: Bless you. I actually didn't even know you founded Zero, by the way. I use that app all the time.
00:08:20.804 - 00:08:21.864, Speaker B: Oh, awesome.
00:08:22.284 - 00:09:10.264, Speaker A: And he was actually our most recent guest on the salon podcast. And so if you haven't had a chance to listen to that episode, it's going to be sitting in the top spot this week as well because we're skipping. So go ahead and give that a listen. It's one of our highest rated episodes of the season. So we cover a lot of really interesting things that we'll expand on within this chat, and then we'll also cover a lot of really other exciting things. Kevin's one of the judges for the hackathon as well, and NFTs are something that he's incredibly passionate about. So everyone here, if you're involved building an NFT project, this will be a great chance to ask him any questions live, get direct feedback on features that might be interesting and ways that Solana is a superior alternative to some of the existing applications available.
00:09:10.264 - 00:09:15.404, Speaker A: And so I think with that, totally, I want to toss over to you and Kevin and you'll have fun.
00:09:17.344 - 00:09:18.656, Speaker C: Thanks. Thanks, Austin.
00:09:18.720 - 00:09:19.684, Speaker B: Thanks, Austin.
00:09:20.104 - 00:09:28.044, Speaker C: Yeah. Awesome to chat with you again. So I think it's been like a couple weeks or a month. I can't tell in crypto time.
00:09:28.784 - 00:09:29.486, Speaker B: Years?
00:09:29.640 - 00:09:38.814, Speaker C: Yeah, a couple of crypto years, I guess. I'd love to hear, like, what you think has been interesting since our last chat in the NFT space.
00:09:39.554 - 00:10:38.566, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is a space that's just moving so fast and in a lot of ways and in a lot of, like, I don't know if we should be doing this kind of ways, but I would say the exciting stuff is that the original projects, like things like crypto punks and what theyve done have just been continuing to be validated by traditional art world. We had that Christies auction, which is just crazy. I think the fully realized price, which is theres always a buyers premium on top of the hammer price. It was somewhere around $19 million for the one alien and then a few other punks thrown in there as well. So it was just insane to see this mixture of the traditional art world. You have Banksy's and these other paintings in the background that are actually going up and dropped in as the crypto punks in the middle of it. But I think this is, not only is it validation, but it's also exposure.
00:10:38.566 - 00:11:06.412, Speaker B: It's just really nice to see traditional art collectors getting exposed to this world. And I think that's an awesome thing that Christie's is doing. Sotheby's has talked about doing it. Phillips is likely to do it next as well. These are the biggest auction houses that deal with traditional art. And, you know, you can tell it's more old school because they're on the phone, like, talking to bidders. Like, you know, you can always tell if it's a crypto bidder or not, because, like, you're like, they're like, oh, a new online bid just came in.
00:11:06.412 - 00:11:44.394, Speaker B: You're like, okay, that person knows how to use a computer. And then there's somebody on the phone like this, right? That's just like, should we go up? Oh, yeah, you want to go to another bid? Okay, one more bid. You know, it's like super old school. Like someone that doesn't even know how to use a computer yet, so. No, but all jokes aside, like, it's, yeah, it's really important to have that world come along for the ride and to explain to them what these NFTs are all about. Um, you know, uh, the cryptopunks founders also launched a new project called me bits, which is, uh, these little three dimensional characters, uh, 20,000 of them in total, um, all with different attributes to them. So different types of hair color and shirts and pants.
00:11:44.394 - 00:12:08.494, Speaker B: And like, they're these cute little characters. They're not trying to be, uh, too realistic. They're more like, uh, you know, voxel kind of blocky style. Um, and they just sold out, like, immediately. Like, it was, they, they were doing this, um, uh, dutch auction. And I think the floor that it hit before they all went was around two and a half ETH, um, per, per little me bit. And, uh, yeah, it was crazy.
00:12:08.494 - 00:12:36.088, Speaker B: Um, it's just, uh, these are cool little characters because they're not just art, you know, like, they're actually things that you can use. They come with three dimensional models. So, you know, you can imagine in every single metaverse that's being created, there will be the capacity to say, okay, I have my character. I just want to bring it with me and run around with my little character. It's just going to be, it's going to be a fun world, like three years from now kind of thing. A lot of desserts just now being built.
00:12:36.216 - 00:13:21.660, Speaker C: So yeah, that's what I'm excited about. You know, like we talked about on the podcast, how, to me, this stuff really feels like nineties massive multiplayer online games just coming to the forefront and being like, that sucked up, like, hours and months of my life in aggregate. Do you think that this Christie's thing is really legitimizing this form of art? I kind of look at this stuff and think, what if Andy Warhol just painted soup cans all day long? And the little errors and differences in each one is what makes it unique. I want soup can number 42 because it's got that particular air in it.
00:13:21.812 - 00:14:14.468, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, it's a good point. I think that there's certainly a depth that may be lost there in the digital format that you would get in something that's traditional, that's hanging on your wall, that you can visit. But then there's also a complexity that's added that you wouldn't get meaning, like some of the programmability of the pieces of art and the creativity that can come from that side as well. So it's not to say that we should stop painting altogether, but it's like, there's something really. There's an artist that I like. It goes by Zero X death beef that is just this crazy artist that has come up with, um. Essentially what it does is every time that you trade the NFT, it loses some of the fidelity.
00:14:14.468 - 00:14:33.436, Speaker B: So, like, it loses some of the quality. So it looks at how many times it's kind of been passed around, and it starts getting shittier and shittier the more it's been passed around. So, like, he has one. I think he might have sold it already, but he had one minting left. Uh. Cause, you know, I think he minted. I want to say it was like seven of them, one fresh minting left.
00:14:33.436 - 00:14:54.904, Speaker B: So it was like, you know, who wants to buy the fresh minting? The one that hasn't yet hit a wallet, you know? And there's just some of that creativity that is just so freaking cool, you know, like that. That is just. That's just like, one of probably a dozen examples of artists doing really interesting things with the different programmability side of the art. So I'm excited for that. That unlock.
00:14:55.644 - 00:15:13.490, Speaker C: Yeah, that's really cool. And you kind of have to suspend your belief a little bit because you can always go back in time and look at the original. Right. But. But this idea that this digital thing has this, like, baked in algorithmic degradation is really, really interesting.
00:15:13.562 - 00:15:33.724, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, well, I mean, it's interesting to think about, yes, you can go back in time and look at the original now, but, like, what about when there are. There is the ability to go in and say, okay, actually, that piece of the code does go away or get encrypted or get locked down, so you won't be able to see. I mean, I guess you could if you figured out how to capture it in a high enough resolution.
00:15:33.804 - 00:15:42.404, Speaker C: And so is there randomness that's baked into this? Like, it, does it randomly degrade? Like, whether it pulls some entropy from the chain or something like that?
00:15:42.484 - 00:16:36.184, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not sure exactly. I'd have to go look at the code, but I know that the one thing that it does refer back to is the number of times it's been moved. So I'm not sure how it's looking at that on the ETH side. But, yeah, the craziness, though, right now, and this, this is very applicable to Solana. And it's something that I'm excited for, for you all, is just that, you know, the hottest projects that we're seeing that, that when they launch, they have a fixed set of them that go, you know, so, like, you know, art blocks, which is doing the majority of the generative art stuff. If they have a really hot project that has a 200, let's say, 256 pieces of artwork, people are shoving through, like, four or five x gas fees just to get their transaction in. And it's like, it's really sad because you have something that could be very collectible that people would be into, meaning that a lot of these floors are very approachable, like, you know, a couple hundred dollars kind of thing.
00:16:36.184 - 00:17:09.184, Speaker B: And then you have people shoving through several thousand dollars in gas just to get one of them. And it's just like, it's such a bummer. It's such a bummer because it could be such a very approachable, beautiful thing. And then, and then we have these, you know, whales that come in and just, you know, kind of eat it all up, and there's no chance for the average person except in the secondary market. And then, of course, they're trying to flip it for ten x as much and. But, yeah, that, man, this gas thing is. It's actually really awesome for Solana because it's such an opportunity.
00:17:10.884 - 00:17:29.680, Speaker A: Kevin, do you think open editions and random drawings, how does that play into, like, bypassing gas fee issues where a lot of platforms offer options for, you just submit a dollar for a ticket. They randomly pick one out of 99, and then you kind of avoid this.
00:17:29.712 - 00:18:15.442, Speaker B: Gas overload yeah, I mean, that's definitely one way around it. I've seen a couple different ways that are starting to emerge. People are starting to move projects over to matic to try and figure out if they can do this on L2 to avoid some of this. Yeah, there's a handful of creative little hacks. I've even spoken with someone that they will try and block the same address from, requesting too many from the same auction. But these are all just like cat and mouse, like, little simple things to try and figure out ways to prevent people from coming in, snagging a bunch of them. But I really like the idea of rewarding long term collectors.
00:18:15.442 - 00:18:47.834, Speaker B: So people that have held certain works of art, um, and, and saying, like, oh, if you, like, if you go into art blocks and you just have a naked new wallet, like, maybe you should have to get in through some type of random drawing initially. And then once you're in, it's like, okay, does this person own another art block that they haven't moved out of their wallet? That there's, you know, like, how, how true are they to the community and to the collectability side versus just wanting to come in and flip things and just looking for the, at their public wallet to say, to prove some of that? So, I don't know. We'll see what they decide to do.
00:18:49.534 - 00:19:05.594, Speaker C: I mean, like, I think the auction in this, like, it drives a lot of the value, right? Like, it's a spectacle of it that, like, makes it valid in a lot of ways. Do you think that that's still possible without high gas fees?
00:19:06.894 - 00:19:32.998, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. These don't really come into play. Play. I mean, you still see the beeples going for crazy amounts of money and, you know, there's a handful of artists that are just kind of starting to emerge and, like, XCoP is another one that is just, his stuff is going for, you know, over a million dollars. Actually, I shouldn't say his. I don't even know if it's a. It could, it could be.
00:19:32.998 - 00:20:03.636, Speaker B: I don't think it's a totally anonymous artist. I'm not sure who it is. But they, their stuff is going for over a million USD for the stuff. But they were very early crypto artists as well. So, yeah, I mean, the auction stuff is, is definitely a great way to bring like, a concentration of, of high net worth individuals to bid this stuff up. So I think, you know, Christie's and Sotheby's and the others are, are going to continue to do this. I mean, for them, they just get, they get these insane and they're still demanding them.
00:20:03.636 - 00:20:10.114, Speaker B: They get these insane, like, 2020, 5% hammer fees just to pull this stuff together, which is nuts.
00:20:10.694 - 00:20:12.022, Speaker C: Yeah. Yep.
00:20:12.158 - 00:20:22.598, Speaker B: But they'll continue to be that bridge for traditional collectors because, like, you know, there's no way somebody that's using a cell phone to place a bid is going to be like, okay, let me figure out this metamask thing, because I want to cut out.
00:20:22.686 - 00:20:24.254, Speaker C: They don't care about the fees.
00:20:24.414 - 00:20:25.358, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:20:25.526 - 00:20:27.566, Speaker C: The gas fees are the smallest part of that.
00:20:27.630 - 00:20:29.114, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
00:20:31.414 - 00:20:43.100, Speaker C: Is there like a world where we'll start seeing algorithms being sold on Christie's? Like, is just like going away even to the bottom of this. Like, this is the PSeC generative code.
00:20:43.172 - 00:21:07.264, Speaker B: Yes, I believe that will be the case. I mean, in some sense, we are on our art blocks. Like, there is real JavaScript and code in here that is doing the generative stuff that you are buying. So, yeah, I mean, how crazy is it to think that, I mean, so much has changed. I used to get picked on for being into computers, like, now, like, the algorithm designers of the rockstars. Like, what universe? Like, we definitely in a parallel universe, like, we took a different path.
00:21:08.684 - 00:21:26.228, Speaker C: There was this project a while back for music generation that had a infinite black metal YouTube channel that you would like. You would just listen to this live stream of black metal. And they had singing generated the music, all the riffs and everything. And it was pretty good.
00:21:26.356 - 00:21:27.064, Speaker B: Wow.
00:21:27.604 - 00:21:45.072, Speaker C: Because you can't really distinguish that from norwegian black metal ones do, which is kind of awesome. There's a way to, like, if you constrain the design to like something like cryptopunks or like me bits, like the small generative pieces.
00:21:45.208 - 00:21:45.600, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:45.672 - 00:21:54.044, Speaker C: Once it's constrained, that's where, like, you can start seeing the innovation happening to the level that an algorithm could start doing beautiful things and that.
00:21:54.704 - 00:22:40.794, Speaker B: No, it's happening. Actually, the last year there was an app called Indel, which won app of the year from Apple for the Apple Watch that would create this generative tones and music, like kind of background, soundscape type music, all based on a series of stems that it had access to. And then it would change the different frequencies based on your HRV, your heart rate if you were like, trying to relax you or chill you out. And it was all based on this kind of little AI model that they had running on the Apple Watch and then back on phone as well. So it was just so cool that this was all being dynamically generated based on inputs from your own personal health. Like, it's happening. It's crazy.
00:22:40.794 - 00:22:42.474, Speaker B: And it sounds great.
00:22:43.094 - 00:23:11.344, Speaker C: Yeah. I've always suspected. I have this theory that based on some wacky high school physics, my impressions of quantum mechanics as a kid is that the universe is lazy evaluated. There's some end state that's already known and just everything that we see is this like lazy evaluation. Kind of like, you know, the photon experiment with the split thing. Right. It's the result that drives every.
00:23:11.344 - 00:23:20.664, Speaker C: All the paths. So, you know, us building these blockchains, and then it's a synthetic form of life that can never be shut down, right?
00:23:20.824 - 00:23:21.564, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:22.624 - 00:23:41.884, Speaker C: Where else would, where else would the singularity occur if not inside, like, one of these systems? And then all of this interactions that we're into, it, the art, the ability for this thing to start tracking our moods and sensor data, that's just like kind of us bootstrapping this thing. It's so weird.
00:23:42.304 - 00:23:48.440, Speaker B: It is amazing. I hadn't thought of it that way. That's some of the inputs as well. That's crazy, right?
00:23:48.472 - 00:24:14.380, Speaker C: Like, if this thing gets big enough and it's 10 million people all connected into one shared computer program, right. Ten that's tracking our data, our financial stuff, our moods. You know, we're like, the ants are no longer aware of the intelligence of the anthill, right. This thing is like, has feedback loops that give us money to go, like, go buy more silicon to make sure this thing keeps running.
00:24:14.532 - 00:24:20.184, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, you're kind of talking about Facebook in some sense already.
00:24:20.924 - 00:24:38.884, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see what happens. It's an interesting world. This is like the theory that the singularity is already here. We're just aware of it. Right. But back a bit to reality.
00:24:38.884 - 00:24:51.584, Speaker C: What would you recommend to folks that are out there thinking about nfTs, especially the artists that are not as tech savvy as somebody that's been coding in solidity for the last two years.
00:24:52.364 - 00:25:16.638, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a. It's a good question. I think that a lot of artists are frustrated right now. A friend of mine that's a traditional artist that paints these very beautiful canvas kind of oil paintings around, um, waves. Uh, he actually just reached out to me, uh, last week and was like, I can't afford these gas fees. Like, I cannot even mint something if I want to go sell it. And he thought, you know, this stuff's been selling for around 1500 or so us dollars per nft, which is great.
00:25:16.638 - 00:26:06.444, Speaker B: But he was going to go spend, you know, six, $700 on just minting fees. So I think that the main thing is that we just need, like the on ramp for, for artists needs to be dead simple because you know, you're going to have different, of course, the, the Photoshop native. You know, I've been using Photoshop since version two or four or whatever. The people that are really into tech, they'll, they'll get it and they'll figure out hacks around it and they'll figure out ways to make this stuff all work. But there's just, it'd be a shame if we left a lot of the more traditional artists that don't have the more digital experience behind. And so, you know, I'm just really excited to see some of these tools evolve and mature and actually get creative for the first time. Where the on ramp is, is so much simpler for a traditional artist to come in and interact.
00:26:06.444 - 00:26:46.410, Speaker B: Then there's also the display side. Like, there's just, there's a lot that needs to be built up there as well. I mean, there's no real good way to display these in my house. There's these little infinite object screens, which are cool, but there's no big displays. No one has really hacked that Samsung frame tv, which I hope they will. It'll support nfts because that thing's beautiful for other artwork, but it needs to be, someone needs to crack the entire thing open and just make it an NFT box just so that we can have a tv NFT box. But aside from that, I just think that there's, there's even mobile display of these things.
00:26:46.410 - 00:27:30.394, Speaker B: Some of the wallets is just really crappy way to display the pieces of art that you hold and own. So my hope is that I bought a solana NFT like a week ago when I saw it going out or maybe two weeks ago and I have it now. But I need to figure out how do I actually get that into some form that I can present back and be proud of showcasing and showing off some way? So the wallets will eventually support this stuff. But then I hope there's an app called gallery right now that works for displaying nfts. That's more on the Ethereum side, though, but more stuff like that. I think it's gallery. So yeah, gallery.
00:27:30.394 - 00:28:01.204, Speaker B: So if you go to gallery so slash, you can see basically all of the NFTs that I chose to kind of pick and highlight and you can drag them around and if you can click on one, it'll tell you more information about it and where it was generated. So that's kind of a good first step. But we're getting there. I feel like every couple of weeks I see another really cool piece of this puzzle being solved. So I'm excited to. I think we just need time. We just need another six months of development.
00:28:01.664 - 00:28:09.364, Speaker A: Kevin, did you buy a Solana branded NFT or did you buy an NFT on the salon network? And if so, are you able to share what you got?
00:28:10.144 - 00:28:23.330, Speaker B: Yeah, it was the, let's see here. I have it. It was the sol. I'm gonna. It was a. Solarians. Is that it? Yeah, Solarians.
00:28:23.330 - 00:28:28.482, Speaker B: Click. Is the NFt the first generative NFTs on Solana?
00:28:28.578 - 00:28:32.734, Speaker A: They've been flooding the chat, so I'm sure they're gonna be happy to hear that.
00:28:33.714 - 00:28:40.066, Speaker B: Yes, the Solarians. I was like the first generative NFT on Solana. This is awesome. So of course I had to jump on that right away.
00:28:40.170 - 00:28:40.986, Speaker A: Yep, they did.
00:28:41.050 - 00:29:00.134, Speaker B: And it's just like, I, I'm so, you guys don't even know how pumped I am for the fact that I can just go in there and, I mean, everyone in this already listened to sard knows, but I mean, when, when you just see it work without having to wait like an hour for, like, these things to happen, it's like, oh, my gosh, why can't everyone be on Solana now? Because this is just so much better. Just a better experience, you know, this is fast. So much faster.
00:29:00.474 - 00:29:03.634, Speaker A: Are you plugged into phantom wallet as well then to kind of just do.
00:29:03.714 - 00:29:04.114, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:04.194 - 00:29:05.034, Speaker A: Everything seamlessly.
00:29:05.074 - 00:29:14.606, Speaker B: Yeah. So I, I've started to mess around with the fandom wallet. I haven't. I know they're going to, they're doing the support for NFTs. You know, I'm a little, I'm a.
00:29:14.630 - 00:29:15.694, Speaker A: Little on the wallet side.
00:29:15.734 - 00:29:50.100, Speaker B: I'm always like, oh, why don't we just give this a few, couple more months before I start moving things over to a new wallet? You know, I tend to sit back and wait a little bit for some maturity there before I mess around with wallets. But it's very cool to have it running. You know, I have it in chrome and I, and I always check in on, on it and, you know, obviously you could send a few dollars and play around and stuff like that. But given that teams pedigree, I met with them, had a, you know, zoom with them. Super, super excited for that project. I mean, just rockstar team, really thoughtful, well funded now. It's going to be great.
00:29:50.212 - 00:29:50.764, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:29:50.804 - 00:29:50.996, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:51.020 - 00:30:08.444, Speaker A: I think one other active NFT project, we have several coming in through the hackathon that you'll get to see. But another active one, one that people would talk about a lot, is star Atlas. They're doing reality posters as well, which has been the first of its kind that we've seen on the ecosystem, which has been a really cool, cool experience.
00:30:08.944 - 00:30:23.804, Speaker B: Yeah, I need to get in there. And, you know, I listened to Tully, I listened to your interview with them that you did last season. I thought that was great. It's just like that when you listen to it. You get super excited and they're like, yeah, we're probably like two, three years out, and you're like, come on, I need this, like, tomorrow.
00:30:24.864 - 00:30:25.648, Speaker C: Do you know what I mean?
00:30:25.696 - 00:30:29.330, Speaker B: Like, it sounds so exciting. And then they're like, it's take like years.
00:30:29.402 - 00:30:30.210, Speaker C: Are you kidding me?
00:30:30.242 - 00:30:32.890, Speaker B: Like, this want to happen sooner.
00:30:32.962 - 00:30:44.614, Speaker C: Building, like, a full space game. Right? Like, you know, freelancer. Right. That played that thing to death. Like, having. Having a really rich experience. There is just so much work.
00:30:44.614 - 00:30:53.694, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's a crazy ambitious project. I'm hoping that they, like, you know, move as fast as possible and break things.
00:30:54.034 - 00:31:11.474, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope that, you know, one of the things that I did, like, that they did the NFT thing, I saw that. I'm hoping that they can kind of, like, not try and boil the ocean, but break it into components where we can actually kick the tires a little bit, to your point, on the earlier side. And, like, who cares if a lot of mechanics aren't there, but let's just, like, start playing, you know?
00:31:11.554 - 00:31:48.870, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That that's their plan is to, like, start shipping mini games and stuff like that. And, like, as soon as you have, like, a few interactions, you can build with. I think the exciting thing for me there is that it's possible that, like, in those three years, it develops into, like, an open source project where people are just, like, adding more and more interactions and interplay into the game development. And this was what I think failed for a lot of massive online games, like world of Warcraft, Ultima online. Those games kind of died as soon as the company. It became, like, not a huge growth factor for the company.
00:31:48.870 - 00:31:49.198, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:49.246 - 00:31:49.910, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:50.102 - 00:31:55.258, Speaker C: If their revenues are not going up, they're like, okay, give it to the B team and just put it on life support.
00:31:55.386 - 00:31:55.746, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:55.810 - 00:32:20.064, Speaker C: And, like, if it's an open source ecosystem, I think there's just, the possibilities are endless. This is where, like, it can actually, I think, outpace Epic and Fortnite and any of those companies, and, like, that, that's like, my dream. Right. It's like, how do we build the universe? Not, not how does, like, Fortnite build, like their own version of the Metaverse and like, that we get to import our crypto punks up to.
00:32:20.524 - 00:32:30.904, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. I think. I think it's going to be indie developers that loosen up a little bit and say, actually the community can play a bigger role here that eventually, yeah, that'll happen.
00:32:31.364 - 00:33:05.342, Speaker C: But that conversation of, like, for artists, have you talked to any of the folks that whether they build the art and that ownership of that artwork passes to the owner of the key where they can do whatever they want with it, they can import it into games and stuff like that? Have people, like, understood that component? Because usually artists have this idea that they still own the artwork. It's their copyright, right? They kind of can do whatever they want with it. Is that something that, like, people are starting to understand or like, deal with?
00:33:05.518 - 00:34:06.392, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. It's funny, you know, it's, it's tricky because there's, I think that you're right in that most artists still believe that they own it and they're not quite sure how to come to grips with anonymous owners and, like, the transfer of rights. And you know what licenses is fall under. One of the things that I had this conversation with crypto punks founders when I interviewed them for my podcast, and they were saying that they're fine with, like, someone taking a crypto punk and saying, that's my identity. I want to have that as part of, like, my, you know, my Twitter avatar and I want to put on t shirts and, you know, that kind of thing. But they also want to say, we own this brand so that it doesn't just get knocked off. It's a really, it's a really tricky and fine line to walk, right? Because if you just give up all rights, all of a sudden there could be crypto punks with like an x, two x's at the end or something, right, that can use the exact same design language and confuse people, you know, and they can launch the second project.
00:34:06.392 - 00:35:08.431, Speaker B: People could be buying these thinking they're buying the original cryptopunks, uh, larva labs, but it's not, it's, it'll be a knockoff, right? So owning the actual rights to that gives them the ability to legally chase down and squash a lot of that. That and prevent that from happening. So I see what they're saying. I mean, it's, it's, it is tricky. So it's like, in some sense, you want to give individual owners a lot of rights, but not make sure that doesn't bleed out to something where, um, you know, well, I'll give you a great example. I was, uh, in crypto voxels the other day, and I was walking around and I went through a lot of these kind of virtual nft galleries that you can walk through, and people were hanging up their different arts, and I was talking to actually, one of the curators, and I'm like, okay, so who can put these up? Like, what's the authentication process look like? Someone has to come in here and add their wallet, and they're like, no, actually, you just tell the software whatever you want to hang wherever you want it. And there's something awesome about that, because then you can have your own gallery of stuff that you really admire.
00:35:08.431 - 00:35:45.224, Speaker B: But it's also like, there can be some imitation and potentially some ways to create fraud if you create a fake gallery that's selling stuff that isn't yours. And so there needs to be at some point in time, and I'm sure this will happen. It's just a sign of maturity of these platforms. But when you walk in and you see someone has a me bits avatar they're running around with, if you click on them. And I hate to use the, I don't think blue checkbox analogy is a bad one, but something that says that this is actually owned by the person says that they own it. Like a verified, like they've identified their wallet. And this person does own this piece, I think is going to be important long term for the space, because we just can't.
00:35:45.224 - 00:35:49.764, Speaker B: Otherwise, it's just going to lead to a lot of really bad actors and bad things.
00:35:50.624 - 00:36:03.434, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we have. The irony is that we have, like, the most sophisticated technology to do that. Right. Everyone's got private key infra. Like, that's like the best in class at this point.
00:36:05.454 - 00:36:22.062, Speaker B: Yes, it's definitely doable. Yeah, I always think about this stuff, and I'm just like, yeah, if Elon's re landing rockets on barges out in sea, like, we can figure out how to, like, put a blue checkbox next to somebody's NFT. Like, we can. Coding can be done.
00:36:22.238 - 00:36:36.644, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, PKI, we have it. We have the technology. It is like a cool part of the space. Right? Like, I think it's here. It just takes education and a bit of, like, human hustle to get it out.
00:36:38.344 - 00:37:09.852, Speaker B: Yeah. That's the other thing I would love to see on the Solana side, if there's any hackers listening out there, like, you know, it's interesting. I think there's a really, I don't know what it is from a product standpoint yet, but I think that when you go into crypto voxels or you go into some of these 3d worlds, they're pretty much dead. Like, I don't know if you've all, you've been in there, but when you walk around, there's like, not a whole lot of people doing much of anything. Like, they're spread out now, they're great. We're saying we're going to have a party, you know, then 100 people all show up at the same destination, right. But like, I almost feel like they're being these.
00:37:09.852 - 00:37:58.524, Speaker B: The fact that they don't have any constraints and they are really built for anything leads you to be like, well, what am I doing here? Like, it's fun to build a gallery and stuff like that, but if someone purpose built like, an NFT world that was just for, like, what would you do differently? That if it was just maybe you wouldn't have floating little human bodies going around, maybe there would be a different way to walk through galleries, maybe there would be a different way to have discussions, like, what would that look like? So I just, I hope that people are thinking on that level as well. Like, what can we do to interact with? And I almost think more of a geocities like, type environment. I'm super dating myself, but like, you can just like own a little plot, like top down 2d style versus it having to be some kind of crazy, complex 3d world, you know?
00:37:59.024 - 00:38:29.334, Speaker C: Yeah, I had one of those geocities, like, I think I always, like, I don't know, this is part of like, maybe going through the startup grind is you need to like, build the product that people want first. And then these are features. Importing all of the world, Ethereum or Solana's NFTs into this star Atlas mini game would be awesome. Having a spaceship that looks like a mini bit that's just flying around.
00:38:31.634 - 00:38:31.994, Speaker B: Start.
00:38:32.034 - 00:38:55.084, Speaker C: Doing these ridiculous things and then see what sticks within the product market fit cycle for that thing where you're adding users. What do users want? Like the open ended stuff. I've always seen that kind of failover, like fall over outside of like, second life. That was kind of a interesting, weird experiment before it's time.
00:38:55.504 - 00:39:18.828, Speaker B: Yeah, second life had a massive economy. Yeah. It's funny how a lot of these things that even though in the virtual worlds as well, I feel like the ones that tried to take themselves too seriously, like, tried to make the characters look too lifelike was like, it would have been. Everyone's like, let's make this look more and more like humans. Let's get. When they talk, their mouth moves exactly like humans, and then it ends up being these little, like, boxy, pixelated guys running around. That actually ends up winning.
00:39:18.828 - 00:39:23.796, Speaker B: You know, people didn't need that. They just wanted something simple and fun, you know?
00:39:23.860 - 00:39:24.504, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:26.404 - 00:39:27.660, Speaker A: Both of you actually in that same.
00:39:27.692 - 00:39:28.028, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:28.116 - 00:39:29.052, Speaker A: What. What do you think?
00:39:29.108 - 00:39:31.460, Speaker B: When people go into these virtual worlds.
00:39:31.652 - 00:39:56.244, Speaker A: What are they looking to get out of? Because a lot of the times, the creators build something, and they focus on complexity of the environment, and they build these really robust, like, metaverses, but you kind of lose a sense of community when it's so large that you find yourself running around worlds by yourself. Like, what do you guys. When people join, what. What are they looking to get out of it?
00:39:58.184 - 00:40:13.036, Speaker B: That's a good question. Uh, you know, uh, maybe I'll comment and then totally can as well. I I think for. For me, the frustration I I have personally is when I get in there, it's like, it's. They. They clearly boiled the ocean. Like, it's not good at anything.
00:40:13.036 - 00:40:32.794, Speaker B: Like, you. You get into crypto voxels, and you walk around and you're like, okay. It's. It's like there's these building blocks and there's these galleries you can walk into, but it is like, there's nothing you can do from a utility standpoint. Like, there's nothing, like you can. You can't play any, like, any games inside of it or anything like that. It's just kind of display of buildings.
00:40:32.794 - 00:40:58.322, Speaker B: Right? And so display of buildings. Some hanging artwork, lack of humans, no easy way to connect with others. There's nothing like. Even though when you do see other people there, it's just more little. Like, little bots, like, standing in front of you that are walking, and some are, like, flying awkwardly, and some have their head stuck in a wall, and you're just like, you know, it's just. There's not. There's no purpose outside of just coming to look at a few pieces of art.
00:40:58.322 - 00:41:46.984, Speaker B: And that stuff, that display for me, can be done just as well in a web browser or somewhere else. So I don't see that whenever I see these systems really work. And I see this on the venture side as well, like, on the investment side, it has to be a true, like, at least close to an order of magnitude improvement over something that's already existing for you, for people to really say, this is so important, I must spend my time there. It can't just be a small, little incremental improvement over. Over a web page like people just bail on, especially if it's more complex in terms of the lift. I mean, this was the problem with VR initially, right? Like, we had these really heavy, massive goggle things hooked to computers, and it was like, it was sweaty, it was awkward. There was no multiplayer experience in terms of, like, if someone was watching and they were laughing at you and recording you on their phone at how stupid you looked, like there was.
00:41:46.984 - 00:41:53.764, Speaker B: It wasn't a big, big enough jump leap forward for. For me to spend any considerable amount of time in there?
00:41:55.284 - 00:42:31.844, Speaker C: Yeah, same. I think, like, you have to be really into, like, video games and VR to get into it. I've got a VR set that's just collecting dust, and I had, like, the first Oculus SDK. I really like the more, like, display based augmented reality experiences, like, where you have, like, some big display that displays something like a star Atlas poster that you can kind of, like, look through, like, through the three dimensionality of it, right. It's almost like a window to another world that feels less, like, nausea inducing.
00:42:32.744 - 00:42:33.264, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:33.344 - 00:42:54.452, Speaker C: And kind of, like, kind of cool, right. Because you can it, like, you know, it can be part of the design aesthetic of your house. Right. And give you that, like, out of world experience, right. This is like a window into space, but that kind of stuff, I think, is really cool. But, yeah, like the. Some of the holographic things that are.
00:42:54.452 - 00:43:04.724, Speaker C: People are researching where you just look at the screen, like on a table and you see that. That part of it, too, is something really cool that people are developing.
00:43:04.844 - 00:43:09.684, Speaker B: But, I mean, we've been one that's in Star wars, right? Like, it's been a long time coming.
00:43:09.844 - 00:43:34.740, Speaker C: Yeah, it's just. It's just early, right? Like, I had this idea, like, a while back. Like, if you. When those, like, magnets came out, like those, like, teeny tiny magnets, it. To make him, like, electromagnetic and have them automatically reassemble and, like, starting 3d, like, 3d art out of that. That's, like, that morphs. But it's just, like, too early for any of this.
00:43:34.740 - 00:43:36.984, Speaker C: It just takes too much time to develop.
00:43:38.804 - 00:44:00.344, Speaker B: Yeah, that would be huge if you could do an auto assembling, like, magnetic. Oh, I gotta mute for a second. Sorry. I have someone in the backyard cleaning real quick, so I'm just meeting the old hand signal. Okay. Sorry about that.
00:44:00.504 - 00:44:08.640, Speaker C: Yeah, no worries. Are. Are you planning on making in your own art or.
00:44:08.792 - 00:44:25.964, Speaker B: It's a good question. I like it from the coding standpoint there, I might dabble on that. Like, I don't consider myself a, you know, quote unquote artists. Like, anytime I do. Um, on the design side, it's more on the product side, you know, just, like, functionality, usability side. That's always been my roles.
00:44:34.504 - 00:44:37.964, Speaker C: Hey, Austin. Did we lose Kevin?
00:44:39.024 - 00:44:43.718, Speaker A: I wasn't sure if that was me, but I think. I think that is Kevin. We'll give him a second, and I'm sure he'll jump.
00:44:43.766 - 00:44:44.374, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:44:44.534 - 00:44:47.534, Speaker A: I was like, on my twitch thing.
00:44:47.694 - 00:44:50.714, Speaker C: The lawnmower went over his fiber off the cable.
00:44:52.334 - 00:44:55.110, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh, this is good.
00:44:55.182 - 00:44:56.126, Speaker B: I don't know if you've been paying.
00:44:56.150 - 00:45:15.184, Speaker A: Attention to, like, the twitch chat or anything like that, but people, people are loving this. I think these are conversations that, like, we typically don't have as part of our normal content map. And so incorporating a lot more of this and seems to have done really, really well. He'll be back.
00:45:16.364 - 00:45:16.956, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:17.060 - 00:45:20.660, Speaker C: You got questions I can answer. Just throw some stuff at me.
00:45:20.772 - 00:45:21.092, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:21.148 - 00:45:38.412, Speaker A: So just kind of like, what do you want to see people build? I think this is the main thing. The hackathon started what? Last night? Yesterday. Like, hackathon officially started yesterday. Like, we're under wraps. Like, what do you want to see people build? And for everyone in the chats, Kevin will be back. Just give us a moment.
00:45:38.548 - 00:46:10.082, Speaker C: Like, I don't want to be prescriptive because I am not, like, I'm not like, a, you know, the good test. Like, you know, you got to have your own vision. So with NFTs artists, such an open design space, what you believe in. Like, I really feel like, sorry about that. Oh, no worries, man. We were just asking, like, what. What do you think people should build? Like, my thoughts were like, build what you're really passionate about, because art is such a, like, space where conviction is almost the most important part.
00:46:10.082 - 00:46:39.364, Speaker C: Like, you know, don't worry about, like, what other people think or what you think other people want. Like, some of the coolest digital art experiences that I've had were, like, the visualizers for winamp that were, like, pretty impressive. Like, made a huge impression of you. Like, watching the interplay of, like, art and music. So doing that kind of stuff, like, plug that. Plug a visualizer to audience and, like, make that an NFT. That would be pretty wild.
00:46:39.364 - 00:46:42.720, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:46:42.832 - 00:47:05.144, Speaker B: Yeah. 100% agree. I mean, it's also what you'll stick with long term. Right? Like, these things are not going to be when you choose something that you're really personally passionate about versus something that we're going to tell you to go do today day. You know, like the second you run into any, like, as you always will, something's gonna, like, not work or be a pain in the ass. Like you have to have that internal drive and passion for, otherwise it never works.
00:47:06.364 - 00:47:19.512, Speaker C: Yep. Yeah, that, that, that's 100% true. You know, like in any kind of startup, if you're really thinking about as an artist or a startup, you're gonna have to eat glass for a while before you get, get some success.
00:47:19.648 - 00:47:20.496, Speaker B: That's right.
00:47:20.640 - 00:47:25.364, Speaker C: I think artists probably know that more than anyone else. More, more even than like founders.
00:47:29.824 - 00:47:31.444, Speaker B: What are you, hopefully you all can see.
00:47:32.504 - 00:48:16.234, Speaker A: What are your guys opinions on loaning and fractionalizing nfts? So I kind of wanted to ask this earlier on the conversation we were talking about, like, the blue check marks. So let's say you're able to authorize that this is the real crypto punks, for example. And then someone puts it up on an NFT lending platform. Like, what are your thoughts on how ownership of that should be decided as it gets moved around from parties that are not the original owner? Because I foresee this being something that really, I'm sorry, I see this something that really blows up in the future, especially like collateralized loans against your nfts where then someone can borrow it. You are an interesting, as they're out using it at like a party in a virtual metaverse or something. So like, what do you, how do you think that should be handled?
00:48:17.974 - 00:49:11.644, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's no easy answer here, right? Like, I, I've seen this already done in a, in a couple different ways. I mean, NFTX does it to some extent where you can wrap a punk and throw it into a pool and pull out some, some, some cash while it's sitting there in that pool, but you don't guarantee to get the same one back out. I've seen, um, the, the way I've seen it done most successfully has not been how do we tokenize it and divide it up? Because that's like, how do you figure out the buyout price? How do you figure out how to get people out of the ownership if you want to bring it back together as a single unit? Those mechanics are challenging. I have seen daos come together and purchase nfts and hold them as a group. And I think that's the cleanest way. You don't try and do some weird fractional ownership. You can do the DAO takes ownership of that entity and then there's the fractionalized ownership actually happens at the Dow level, not at the NFT level, if that makes sense.
00:49:14.104 - 00:49:23.352, Speaker C: That's a cool approach, too. There's something. Yeah, then you kind of guys, everybody comes together and buys a gallery, effectively, right?
00:49:23.368 - 00:49:47.432, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we have that. I'm a member of a Dow called Flamingo Dow. We've just a ton of different crypto punks, and you name it. And essentially what happens, for those of you that don't know and don't see it because it's a kind of backroom discord, is there will be anyone can bring up something new. Like, hey, I found this great new artist. Look at this.
00:49:47.432 - 00:50:32.184, Speaker B: What do you think? And then there's like these little simple, like, voting buttons that you use in discord, you know, like for anything else, like a thumbs up or thumbs down. And if it gains enough momentum, then it's just like the treasury funds are deployed and the purchase is made and is transferred into the secure vault. The dow then holds. If it's over a certain price and it requires a bigger vote, then it's actually done on chain, and there's smart contracts for all that. And then you go in and you actually authorize your wallet, and you go and you actually place a vote. But, I mean, they were able to acquire crypto punk alien like that, which at the time was, I think it was like something like $800,000 for it, which was crazy to see them come together and actually make that big purchase. But, yeah, it's a really clean and dynamic, and they can just move so quickly.
00:50:32.184 - 00:50:39.784, Speaker B: Like, this stuff happens. There'll be something will go up for vote and be purchased within a couple hours, you know, which is, which is great.
00:50:42.324 - 00:50:58.954, Speaker A: I didn't realize that you were part of Flamingo Dao. That's really cool. Actually, the Dao in social token space is something that I'm personally really interested in for a lot of folks here, they might not be familiar with what something like Flamingo Dao actually does. Do you want to just take a moment to expand on that?
00:51:00.054 - 00:52:05.934, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, Flamingo was a purpose built, a dao, a decentralized, autonomous organization that comes together to just collect NFT art. And so essentially, there was the original DAO project on Ethereum that did not work, that had that hack that everyone heard about and everyone gave up for a while. And then a couple of the original folks that created that, then started the Lao Lao, and then from there created Flamingo Dao, which was just for NFTs and this was all done under or working with a legal group called Open Law. And essentially they created this organization that is very much run. I mean, there's an llc behind it, so there's a real corporate entity behind it in that, um, it's, you know, you get actual tax paperwork at the end of the year, all that good stuff, but you come in and when they have open available slots, new members are voted upon. And then if you're accepted in, you buy in with some ETH.
00:52:05.934 - 00:52:39.356, Speaker B: So we'll say, okay, the overall collection of all of the NFTs in the project is probably worth this much. So it would cost you this much ETH to actually come in and buy, you know, 1% of the pool or whatever it may be. You transfer your money in all via smart contracts, and then you're accepted into the membership. You get access to the chat community, and then inside of discord, there's all these different private channels. And, you know, they're, they're kind of dedicated to all the different topics you could imagine. There's a channel on generative art. There's a channel just for people, there's a channel for all the top artists that are out there.
00:52:39.356 - 00:53:35.042, Speaker B: And so, you know, the group comes together and does weekly calls, and, you know, there'll be like a call where you jump on and you talk about all the latest, new, hottest nfts. Um, and then they decide collectively, like, is this something we want to talk to the artists about? Do we want to go out and try and buy some of this artwork on the secondary market? Do we want to try and buy it when it's being minted? Do we want to have one off commission pieces done? You know, it can be a whole different ways, different ways of going out and collecting this art. And then, um, once the purchase has been made, it goes in and you can see all of it publicly. You can just go to Flamingo XYZ, and then on inside there, there's a section where you can just, you view the gallery and see all the different works of art that the Dao holds. And then eventually there's a vote that says, okay, I think we should sell this particular piece of art, or it's appreciated this much. And we have two of them, so let's get rid of one of them. And when any sales happen, it's just like any other thing on that.
00:53:35.042 - 00:54:07.974, Speaker B: There's distributions back to the owners of the daO. And so Flamingo is a very overarching kind of like built for all NFTs. Then there are very specific ones. Like, there's one called squiggledow. That is just these little squigglies that were created in art blocks, which was snow Fro's original generative squiggly little guy. And those little squigglies you can still pick up for, I think it was like seven or $800 the floor price ones. And if you just own one of those squigglies in your wallet, they'll let you into the dow.
00:54:07.974 - 00:54:30.604, Speaker B: So it's kind of like a way of, you knock on the door and they say, show me your squiggly. And then you're let it into the secret room where you can talk about all these different things. So there's a, there's a bunch of different ways that people are approaching it. Some you have to own auto glyphs to get into their NFT Daos. And it's just a, it's just a fun way for collectors to get together, discuss new projects, and then collect them under, under a structure.
00:54:36.184 - 00:54:36.536, Speaker C: Totally.
00:54:36.560 - 00:54:40.184, Speaker A: We're gonna say something, and I wouldn't interrupt you for like the third time.
00:54:40.684 - 00:54:45.624, Speaker C: No, I was just agreeing with Kevin. Yeah, I had like a.
00:54:48.124 - 00:55:37.224, Speaker A: I think this is, this is something that's really interesting, being able to have communities that you have to prove ownership of a specific asset or number of assets, because it just means that everyone has equal, equal skin in the game. It allows for more of an authentic community to be formed around something that everyone, everyone believes in enough to put capital up for. And I think there's a lot of really interesting things from a community building perspective that we're going to see with incorporating NFTs and Daos in the future, where a lot of artists are going to open up websites or specific discord groups where you need to prove ownership of X, Y and Z, and then that way all these collectors can come together. Outside of Flamingo. Pleasured out is doing some cool stuff there. They're around a new one. Seed club has been another interesting project involved with all of that, and they're all just taking really, really unique approaches to it.
00:55:37.224 - 00:56:08.604, Speaker A: But for anyone that's watching, if you haven't explored the DaO space, there's a lot of amazing things going on there. It's a great way to build community, meet people that are really dedicated to this space, and get involved with something that's actually trying to make a positive change within crypto. And I suggest everyone, everyone checks it out. Out. Toli, we have about four minutes left. Kevin, I'm sure you were slammed. Anything you want to cover for the last minute or two here, and then I might ask a couple of questions of them floating around the chat.
00:56:10.664 - 00:56:39.024, Speaker C: Yeah, I just want to reiterate, folks that are building for the hackathon, just try something, whatever it is, and then iterate. Like, don't think too much about having the most important thing as a hit on your first go. I failed a thousand times before I did something right. So just keep that in mind and have fun. Go build something, ship something. Have fun doing it.
00:56:40.004 - 00:57:07.264, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And then also, I'm obviously a huge fan of all things Solana and continue to track it and was an early investor there as well. So if people want to ping me on Twitter, I have open DM's. So if you're working on something for the hackathon, you're just like, hey, I think you think this is cool and you just want me to take a look at it. I'd love to, love to do that and see, am I allowed to do that as a judge? Am I allowed to look at things early? Maybe not. We didn't hear.
00:57:08.324 - 00:57:19.738, Speaker C: Yeah, we don't have any strict, you know, like, if you're like one of those founders that knows how to hustle and talk to the judges beforehand, those are the people that we're looking for.
00:57:19.906 - 00:57:26.122, Speaker B: Nice. It is dawn on me. I might be helping them cheat, but yeah, I'd love to see stuff if.
00:57:26.138 - 00:57:35.614, Speaker C: You can find a way to cheat, but you're like, you might have the right kind of mix of characteristics to succeed as a startup founder.
00:57:37.634 - 00:57:57.876, Speaker A: It's now self selection through Kevin's DM's for Wednesday. Yeah, I think just closing out here. Kevin, any advice for people that are building, aside from them hitting your DM's, which you're a bold person for, keeping those open at your follower account.
00:57:57.940 - 00:58:51.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Tilly's got a great point here and it's definitely worth mentioning, again, is that some of the things, especially around hackathons, where your time is fixed and you don't have a ton of, you have to get something out. It is so easy to say, I want to go do these 10, 15, 20 things and this is going to be so huge and awesome. And then you just get stuck not launching anything or actually shipping anything. So just boiling it down to what is the one thing I do want to ship and have ready to go and actually have it working by that time is much more important than having a feature complete, like, version of something. So just get something up and running that you can continue to iterate on later. And what is that minimal viable product they always talk about that you can get to that is enough to where it wows people, but it doesn't feel fully polished or fully functional yet. That would be my big piece of advice.
00:58:52.424 - 00:59:08.144, Speaker A: Kevin, real quick, someone's been asking a ton of questions. I've ignored most of their questions, but they just popped a new one in here. Do you think nfT markets can move from ETH to soul? Like, do you think that's something that we're going to see in the future of like, entire markets moving from the ethereum infrastructure of Solana?
00:59:09.324 - 01:00:07.234, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, as much as I don't believe that, well, I have high hopes for Solana on so many different fronts, but I do believe there's a lot of pain points right now in the ethereum world. World. And there's no real reason why they have to be on Ethereum. Some of the, like, original collectors are saying, well, I want to be on theorem because I know it's just going to be around and it's like it was the, it was the first, you know, even though I guess Namecoin was probably the first to actually do nfts. But you know, those, those questions around longevity of a blockchain, they just need time, right? Like, people become more and more comfortable moving things over. And especially if you can prove to people that the tooling is there and that it's just so much easier to do it on the Solana side and cheaper. And it's just like, it's, you know, I have a feeling that in six months time, when we look at what's being built on Solana around all the tooling side, and if an artist can come in, I can.
01:00:07.234 - 01:00:41.260, Speaker B: You know, my earlier example about a friend that didn't want to spend $800 in gas fees, and they're definitely going to have a hard time trying to figure out how to do some of this matic stuff. If I can point them to really easy Solana tooling, like, there's no for them, they don't care. They don't have the kind of, like, they're not stuck to Ethereum. They just want to get their artwork out there. And I would imagine a lot of these, like, opens and others, they're going to some other, other chains. Like, there's already a considerable amount of nfts that are being mentioned on wax. And, you know, there's, I mean, there's three or four other chains that are producing nfts every single day.
01:00:41.260 - 01:00:49.734, Speaker B: That people are collecting. So it's not like this is going to be one chain to rule them all. I believe it's going to be multiple chains.
01:00:52.714 - 01:00:53.534, Speaker A: I think.
01:00:55.234 - 01:01:25.654, Speaker C: I think one chain will be 80% of the world, but we'll see which one that is. I'm pretty sure it's going to be us. But it is such a pareto efficient space where every trade off has a different result somewhere else. So definitely see BTC not going away anywhere. And ethereum as well, especially, there's a world where ETH one sticks around, even if two launches, which would be interesting.
01:01:27.074 - 01:01:59.820, Speaker B: Yeah, it's crazy how just it's. I think about when I think of Ethereum and how much innovation there was there back a few years ago, it was just, like, mind blowing. You're like, whoa, what can be done? This is crazy. And now when I think of it, it's just like, I feel. I feel bloat, you know, I feel bloat and a lot of, like, side hacks to make things happen. And, I mean, this is probably going to happen to everyone, you know, unless we can continue to stay really nimble. It's just like the, with time, this, like, something will happen to where people be like, salon is no longer good for this like it used to be.
01:01:59.820 - 01:02:41.792, Speaker B: You know, it's like, how are you going to, how are you going to prevent that from happening? But I do feel like, you know, in all my spidey senses, when you watch what's going on with Solana and you look at, like, the different wallets that are coming online and just different projects are moving over and USDC coin coming over and, like, all these different assets are starting to shift. Like, it just, it feels like now is the time. Like, things are all really, really starting to happen. And I don't know, I have a feeling that this is going to be. NFTs will have a great home if the tooling is built, I think it's going to be a big deal for Solana. We'll see. You guys know more than I do on that front, so I'm excited to see what's coming.
01:02:41.968 - 01:02:57.638, Speaker C: Yep, me too. Cool. Yeah. On that note, I mean, it's. I've got meetings back to back, but really, really awesome to chat with you. I hope the folks listening to this had a good time and, like, build some really cool shit for the hackathon.
01:02:57.736 - 01:03:02.266, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm excited. Thanks, Tilly. Thanks, Austin. Appreciate it. Thanks, everyone, for tuning in.
01:03:02.290 - 01:03:04.654, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone, for tuning in. Have a good one.
01:03:05.434 - 01:03:06.034, Speaker B: Have a good day.
