00:00:00.960 - 00:00:23.886, Speaker A: Proof of history enables the blockchain to work fast while maintaining security and decentralization. Here's an analogy. If snapshots of dye diffusion were scrambled, you would know how to place the resulting images in order. Again, because of the laws of entropy as a function of time, proof of history uses a recursive, verifiable delay function.

00:00:25.190 - 00:01:09.944, Speaker A: Events and transactions. Every event has a unique hash and count along this data structure as function of real time. This information tells us what event had to come before another, almost like a cryptographic timestamp, giving us a verifiable ordering of events as a function of time. Each node gets a cryptographic clock that helps the network agree on time and ordering of events without having to wait to hear from other nodes. Unlike slower traditional blockchains, oftentimes throttled by various consensus mechanisms, Solana achieves high throughput without sacrificing network security. Visit solana.com to learn more.
