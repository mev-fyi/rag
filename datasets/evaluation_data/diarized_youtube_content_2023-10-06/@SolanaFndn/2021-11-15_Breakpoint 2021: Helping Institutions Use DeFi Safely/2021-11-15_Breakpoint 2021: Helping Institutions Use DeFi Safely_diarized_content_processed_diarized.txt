00:00:12.120 - 00:00:46.744, Speaker A: Hey, guys, I know that I'm the last piece between you guys and lunch, so I'll keep it quick. So, yeah, my name is Van. I want to talk a little about Defi and how institutions, which are our current set of customers, work with Defi. A little floating point group is that we help traditional financial institutions trade, settle, and custody their cryptocurrency. Yeah. So without further ado. So, yeah, what is DeFi right now? DeFi has grown a large, large, large amount in the past year.
00:00:46.744 - 00:01:05.364, Speaker A: In fact, the yields have. Sorry. The year to date growth has been 57 billion. And that's a lot more than. Yeah, that's a lot more than I expected when I started a floating point group, as well as when you guys probably started exploring crypto. Right. We're all excited for this.
00:01:05.364 - 00:01:33.438, Speaker A: Yeah. The change that's happening right now. Now, with respect to traditional financial institutions, they're excited about DeFi, but not for the top right corner. They're not excited for 9999% yields. They're not excited for getting the best nfts. They're not looking to make $20,000 on an NFT. What they're looking for is something a bit less grandiose.
00:01:33.438 - 00:02:18.412, Speaker A: But just as important, they just want the ability to beat the current ten year treasury bond. Right now, that is less than 1%. If we offer, and by we, I mean the DeFi community as a whole, offer something that is a little bit better than 1%, in this case, 4.48%, then we're golden. And that's how we can get at least the financial interest of traditional financial institutions on our side. So, yeah, with respect to how floating point group advises are the institutions that we work with, we generally have a list of blue chip stocks. Generally, blue chip stocks has a variety of criteria.
00:02:18.412 - 00:03:00.044, Speaker A: They're traded on Coinbase. They're traded on Kraken. The SEC has not explicitly said anything of injury to them. And lastly, the contracts are all auditable. And that floating point group ourselves have read the details of it in order to recommend to our customers in good faith to use these DeFi products. So, yeah, what are these products? I'm sure you guys know all of these products listed here, but the one that we will talk a little bit more about, at least with respect to tradfi, is borrowing and lending traditional finance. They have a lot of capital.
00:03:00.044 - 00:03:39.632, Speaker A: That's why we're so interested in working with them. But they're not looking to make, again, the next NFT. They're not looking to do anything better than 5% which is what a yield aggregator would provide. And in addition, yield aggregators are an issue because they, well aggregate a bunch of use from different protocols. And having more protocols mean more surface areas for ATT and CK. So, yeah, here is a little landscape of what DeFi is and how traditional financial institutions are judging it. The green is what traditional financial institutions consider safe.
00:03:39.632 - 00:04:13.954, Speaker A: The yellow is a little bit more risky. These are where hedge funds and asset managers tend to play a part. And the red are very adventurous hedge funds. So I don't think you guys are going to be surprised about anything here. We already know that synthetics are a really big issue. The SEC, Gary Gensler, specifically said that synthetic stocks are definitely under the purview of the SEC, just by virtue of the fact that they represent, they're representation of stocks. On the top left corner, you have just simple cryptocurrencies.
00:04:13.954 - 00:04:54.028, Speaker A: This would be where you can imagine the government buying it, some kind of corporate treasury buying it. And yeah, on the diagonal is the space for hedge funds. And in FPG's case, our set of customers are hedge funds. So, yeah, what are the risks that are involved with, with Defi? Well, the first risk is default risk. I won't go into more detail. I'm pretty sure there's one word that you guys are all familiar with, and the word is rug pull. Rug pulling is a big issue for Solana, mainly because the code is less readable by virtue of the bike.
00:04:54.028 - 00:05:51.974, Speaker A: Yeah, by virtue of how it compiles. And in addition, there is a lot more, a lot more nfts being minted out or being created in Solana, just by virtue of the lower cost inhibitions of Solana. The second part is the tech, as I mentioned a little bit, audits are quite important. Audits are, of course, a little bit more challenging in Solana because it's a different language compared to Ethereum. The auditors that are popular on Ethereum are only slowly moving to Solana right now. And yeah, they're getting their bearings, but it will be a while until the auditors for Solana have the methodology to actually move forward with a lot of the new projects in Solana. And lastly, I want to give a shout out to the crate project on Solana.
00:05:51.974 - 00:06:59.144, Speaker A: It's creating a more understandable, basically an API for API specification for auditors to read, for the hedge fund engineers to read, for us to read, in order to understand what's actually happening in the hood for Solana. So, yeah, this last part, the second part is regulation. So regulation has been pretty substantial in the past year. I'm sure you guys are familiar with AML, which is anti money laundering. What that entails is that we have to make sure that all of the money, most of the money in cryptocurrency is clean money. We don't want to be using some of the, we don't recommend to our set of customers to be using tornado cash, for instance, because the set of customers that use tornado cash are not the set of customers that hedge funds want to be involved with. The second thing is that the SEC has been tough on DeFi.
00:06:59.144 - 00:07:54.040, Speaker A: The big issue here has been CFI lending. Originally, traditional financial institutions have actually been using the CFI lending platforms just because that is a third party solution for them. They didn't have to access defi themselves. But now that CFI has been getting into much more trouble, hedge funds and whatnot, are looking into deFi just directly in order to solve the problems that they want to solve, which is make money. And lastly, the CFTC luckily is not being very stringent on the regulations of crypto. So yeah, go with them. And the last, yeah, and the last thing I want to talk about for, yeah, for traditional financial institutions to get into defi is transaction monitoring.
00:07:54.040 - 00:08:58.202, Speaker A: So as you can see here, this is a, yeah, this is a DeFi platform. I've hidden the name, but you can see that the level of severity, even though there's a few high risk and a few mediums, it is still considered low risk at the end of the day. So what does it mean to be high risk? Well, it's connected to a high risk exchange. I won't name any exchanges or there could have been a rug pull and the money was sent to said exchange or defi venue and liquidated, and the proceeds were liquidated there. The tradvi does not want to be a part of that. Now I want to give you another platform, and as you can see, this platform, you know, it looks relatively alright if you look right to left, but there's just this one big red blip and that one big red blip. Despite the fact that there's less risk indicators, just that one blip has made this, the severity of this project quite high.
00:08:58.202 - 00:09:41.712, Speaker A: And therefore this project is, you know, eliminated from the purview of traditional financial institutions. And lastly, yeah, I want to talk about yield aggregators. So the issues with yield aggregators is that they're connected to much, much, much more projects. They make money, as you guys know, from aggregating the yields of different protocols and yield farming. And the issue with yield farming is that you're moving tokens from one protocol to another to another to another. And so what traditional financial institutions have to do is analyze all of the different protocols. So, in our case, we can see that everything is medium to low to high, and you can even see a sushi swap considered high.
00:09:41.712 - 00:10:24.604, Speaker A: But then this is definitely eliminated because of harvest. Harvest is a. Yeah, harvest is a less popular blockchain. And right now, before we actually move into. Yeah, I won't speak anymore about harvest. And, yeah, so the future of DeFi is that, provided that we actually address the concerns of tech auditing, as well as, you know, increasing the honest participants of DeFi and decreasing the probability, as well as the potential for rug pulls, we hope to see that, you know, blue chip stocks or blue chip defi can be recommended. As, you know, we're.
00:10:24.604 - 00:10:33.074, Speaker A: I'm sure all of us are big fans of serum, solenart, mango, and sunny. Yeah. So that's it. Are there any questions?
00:10:35.094 - 00:10:38.714, Speaker B: There's questions. I am here to give you the microphone.
00:10:46.174 - 00:11:36.254, Speaker A: I think it's time for lunch. Then if there's no questions. Okay, so how big is the demand or interest from tradfi and defi? What's the kind of feeling? Yeah, so the demand is, at least from our perspective, and a little bit more about us. We have offices in New York, Singapore, we have an office in Cayman, and we see a lot of demand from everywhere in traditional, whether it be Asia, whether it be the US, whether it be Europe. What's stopping them is. Is effectively a stamp, a green light from government to actually move in. They're happy to move in right now due to COVID, as well as the stagnation that's happening.
00:11:36.254 - 00:11:40.814, Speaker A: They're looking for yields in any way they can, and this is one of them.
00:11:44.434 - 00:12:26.054, Speaker C: One question, given the kind of lack of flexibility institutional investors have, like, they have their mandates, it takes them time to kind of change, like, the type of investments they can make with the funds they manage and so on. What's your feeling or your understanding of the situation of the industry in terms of how much institutional players and how much capital is kind of locked? Like willing to get into crypto, willing to get into DeFi, but not able, because they haven't been able to sort out all the issues they have to sort out with their limited partners and so on? And how will it play out in the following months, years, and so on?
00:12:26.834 - 00:13:18.402, Speaker A: Yeah. So just going back into the matrix. So, just to summarize your question a little bit more, you're asking what information do I have that I can share that traditional financial institutions are interested? I would say that a lot like the green is lending, borrowing and staking. I would say that a lot of the Ethereum staking is traditional financial institutions. That is a very clear cut case where traditional financials can just say, hey, we can be a part of this and there's no issues with that right now. That's how they're generating their yields. Now, as for this market size of ethereum staking right now, I'm not too sure off the top of my head, but it's drastic.
00:13:18.402 - 00:13:22.574, Speaker A: The number of stakers are drastically favored towards the institutions.
00:13:25.074 - 00:13:26.894, Speaker B: We probably have time for one more.
00:13:34.654 - 00:13:40.634, Speaker C: Would you say that stable coins are the entry point for institutionals into this field?
00:13:43.534 - 00:14:08.154, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. So not particular. There are two set of institutions. One that is trying to generate yield and one is that it's trying to generate. That's just trying to take some risk and, you know, buy bitcoin and hold bitcoin. For a long time I've been talking about a lot about the former. There is also cases of the latter as well.
00:14:08.154 - 00:14:31.174, Speaker A: You know, microstrategy is a great example of the latter. But as for the former. Yes, it's mainly doing. Yeah, it's mainly using stable coins to actually generate yield. Stable coins are in a great area for my risk matrix. Doesn't really list stable coins here, but stable coins is definitely in the top left. Yeah.
00:14:32.634 - 00:14:39.274, Speaker B: All right, great. Thank you so much, Van. That is all. Please give a round of applause to van.
