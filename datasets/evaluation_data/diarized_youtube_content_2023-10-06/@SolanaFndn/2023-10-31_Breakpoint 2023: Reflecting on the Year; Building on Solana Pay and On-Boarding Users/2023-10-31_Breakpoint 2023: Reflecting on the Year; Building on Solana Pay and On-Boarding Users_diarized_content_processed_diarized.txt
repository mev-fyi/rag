00:00:02.520 - 00:00:18.398, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. How's it going? Good. Having a good breakpoint, safe from the rain. Hi, everyone. My name is John. I run the ecosystem engineering team at the Solana foundation, and I've had the privilege of working with every one of the folks that are up here. We're going to be talking about Solanape.
00:00:18.398 - 00:00:21.606, Speaker A: But before we start, why don't we do some quick intros? I'll start with Siem.
00:00:21.750 - 00:00:33.040, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. I'm Siem. I am co founder of Monstray. And what monstray is, is onboarding merchants on just Lana pay.
00:00:33.152 - 00:00:45.884, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm Isaac. I'm managing director of Venta right now. Venta, for those of you that haven't used it yet, it's like the fridges and all the poss you've seen all around campus, as well as these wristbands.
00:00:46.584 - 00:01:07.164, Speaker D: Hello, I am Fernando Ordona, and I am the co founder of Decaf. What we do at Decaf is mainly two things, payments through the decaf pos that now is Venta. And we also focus on international payments on and off ramps and. Yeah, mainly remittances. Yep.
00:01:07.284 - 00:01:24.856, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, you mentioned this, Isaac, I want to start with you. We have this wonderful activation here at breakpoint where folks can buy stuff with Solana pay. I would love to hear a little bit more about how that came to be, how, you know, tell us a little bit more about the stuff that you've been doing with Monstre and how they all kind of fit together.
00:01:25.000 - 00:02:02.988, Speaker C: Yeah, so, like, day one, Venta didn't just, like, come out of nowhere. We've been working together at least, like, these three teams for probably the past eight months now working with Monstre and some of their NFC tech. They're tap to pay the Decaf team, which is like the best pos I've personally ever used. Like, really getting comfy with them. And then I was working with Sammo as well, and we were doing like, a reward system program. So you'd go to these hacker houses, you would buy some, like, Samo merch, you would get Samo back, you'd use their pos and you could also pay using the wristband. And we did that all the way up until, I think, play GG, which is when you kind of first saw us.
00:02:02.988 - 00:02:19.904, Speaker C: Yeah. And we started talking. We were like, why don't we just, like, offer an all in one payment solution? If you're doing something like maybe breakpoint, a massive festival with like, 3000 people, and you want to do everything on chain and you want to make it easy, why don't we provide that for people? And that's kind of how vento came to be.
00:02:20.844 - 00:02:26.660, Speaker A: I'm curious, from the Monterey standpoint, tell us more about the NFC wristbands and how that whole system works.
00:02:26.812 - 00:03:10.674, Speaker B: Yeah, so how it usually work is, like, initially, we started off as gift cards, and we thought, like, that was unlike the PMF, and we wanted. And onboarding merchants is extremely hard because the attention span is so limited. The moment you're talking about, oh, it's digital currency, and you immediately lose interest. So when we started, we kind of used it as a closed ecosystem. So, like, vouchers or, like, stuff they can relate to, and we put it on, like, this response that organizations can white label it. So I think that's how we start, and I think we have been very lucky to be able to work with such amazing teams to help us to push this product forward.
00:03:11.214 - 00:03:19.670, Speaker A: I'm curious, given that you've done this at a few different hacker houses now, do you see differences in the regionality between each of those activations?
00:03:19.862 - 00:03:55.148, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I think, one, it's like, every hacker house is a little different, and what people want out of certain hacker houses depends where that hacker House is. I think the first time I worked with you guys was over in Ho Chi Minh. That was really, like, nitty gritty. They want to see the blockchain side of things. They want to understand the tech, and it's kind of using things for the sake of using crypto and seeing if you can break and what you can build with it. Then you look at the activation we did in New York, and it was very much like, how can I do this transaction to make it not feel like crypto? How to the end user that's maybe not like a solana maxi.
00:03:55.148 - 00:04:04.386, Speaker C: How can we get them to transact and not, like, make it feel like crypto? Make it feel like using a card, but better. So, yeah, it really depends on the audience, like, and what the activation is.
00:04:04.570 - 00:04:27.514, Speaker A: Speaking of regionality, Fernanda, in decaf, you are operating a wallet, and you have all of these off ramps all over the world. I'd love to, like, maybe make that a little bit more tangible for the folks here. I saw a tweet where I think it was, might have been Rick. Someone went to MoneyGram right here in Amsterdam to pull out some euros. But I'm curious, you know, know more about the regionality and some of the problems that you've seen with that.
00:04:27.674 - 00:05:25.912, Speaker D: Yeah, for those who haven't seen, we did, like, this tweet where Rick is getting cash out of a monogram location that is like 500 meters away from our hotel. And he's getting cash, euros from his USDC, really low fees. So it is actually really, really great. And it is like an innovation that we have done in our wallet, and now we also have it in DCAF pay. So with these people basically can go from USDC to any local currency in 184 countries, thanks to this partnership with MoneyGram, but also in six countries. Now, in Latin America, you can send USDC to your bank account for really, really low fees, which is great because this means that people can send money internationally and then off ramp whenever they need or hold into us dollars USDC till the moment that they need to use it. And this is really cool.
00:05:25.912 - 00:05:55.468, Speaker D: And I think that it's really relevant for this because people were asking us, well, what if I put money in this band? And then at the end of the band I still have some money left? And we are like, well, you can actually off ramp this money into fiat, into euros by going to a moneygram location. And you can do that in the decaf wallet or in decaf pay. That is a web version. So. Yeah, pretty excited about that. We are actually about to release the web version.
00:05:55.636 - 00:06:06.348, Speaker A: Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, I'm curious, of those many countries, where do you see the most pickup? Are there specific places that find this to be really, really useful more than others?
00:06:06.516 - 00:06:53.858, Speaker D: Yeah, it's interesting because we always said that our focus was Latin America, and we have seen mainly from Latin America, places like Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico. That is where people want to hold value in us dollars is something really important for them because of the inflation, devaluation in these areas. But something that we saw is that we started getting traction from places in Africa and we never marketed for these regions. But I think that these people are so willing to look and find new opportunities and new ways to off ramp. And that makes sense. That is cheap. That brings them some value, that they are able to just find it, find us even without any marketing.
00:06:53.858 - 00:07:01.282, Speaker D: And that's what happened with Africa. So now the most users are between Africa and Latin America.
00:07:01.458 - 00:07:05.574, Speaker A: That's amazing. Have there been people who have asked for other stable coins?
00:07:06.554 - 00:07:30.028, Speaker D: Yeah, sometimes we get asked for the euro coin and actually we at, we are not like close to a single chain, a single coin. We just add what makes sense and we always listen to the market and based on that is how we are developing our products. So if at some point we decide that it makes sense to add a eurocoin, we will do it yeah, that's amazing.
00:07:30.196 - 00:08:02.244, Speaker A: I'm going to switch gears a little bit and talk a little bit about the human side of all of these things. So we have seen Solanapay as a specification, as a protocol. If you're not familiar with it, it specifies a few different things from transfer requests to transaction requests that we see in QR codes. It seems like it should be pretty easy to use, but we don't actually see it that often. Maybe even here. But a lot of people still have trouble with here. I'd love to hear a little bit more about what you think is sort of the hurdle to get to the point where people have mobile wallets and it feels easy to use.
00:08:02.244 - 00:08:03.864, Speaker A: I'll start with Isaac Kip.
00:08:03.944 - 00:08:38.266, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's kind of funny. The hardest part is getting in, and then right after that is getting out. We've worked quite a few events now. We've been working with, like, every hacker house since inception, especially, like, from a samo standpoint, we've pretty much been here since day one, and we've seen every type of payment possible. And the hardest part wasn't doing payments. Since I first started using Solana pay, it's been really easy to use, and it's just, like, really well built, and it's kind of a no brainer use case for Solana. High through a put high TPS, really low fees.
00:08:38.266 - 00:09:08.900, Speaker C: It's just like, it's made for payments. Like, what's the issue? Like you said, and I think it's just getting people on. If you don't have Solana, you don't have a crypto wallet, you don't have USDC. It's really hard to justify walking up to a register, going to pay with it, then being like, wait, let me swap out real quick. I got to go on Coinbase and I got to buy Solana, and then I got to send my Solana to my phantom wallet because the coinbase wallet wasn't working. So then I'll scan this QR code and I hope that works out. And then if that doesn't, like, do I get a cool shirt with a dog on it? It's like, yeah, fingers crossed.
00:09:08.900 - 00:09:32.928, Speaker C: And that's just, like, not a good way to do business. People that do business that way were purely doing it for the sake of it being crypto. I know, that's why I did it. I wanted to support it, and it was crypto. It was cool. I'm buying stuff with this money that I talk about all the time, and I'm actually existing with it in real life. But what we ended up finding out is if you can make the onramp easy, you don't have to be like a crypto maxi or a Solana Maxi to want to buy something.
00:09:32.928 - 00:10:07.582, Speaker C: You can actually build a product that is better than the product that's used right now and that people don't even have to know that they're using a better product like what we're doing right now, right? We partnered up with Unlimit. So you can use a debit card, you can use a credit card, you can onboard just by tapping this wristband. And if you put in $20, you'll get 20 usdc in. You pay with that wallet. It's tap to pay something we're all used to with a debit card. And it goes through right away. Our Dev Kai actually over from monster, built it out, and it's like, it takes seconds and it just feels really natural, like, it's a good product.
00:10:07.582 - 00:10:28.594, Speaker C: It's something you're used to. And for a lot of people, if you use it, like, if I gave this to my mom and she used it, she wouldn't even know it's crypto. And, like, that's the beauty of it. And then the hardest part after that was, okay, like we just talked about, it's like, I have money on here. I'm leaving breakpoint now. It's Friday night. How do I get it out? And then that's where it's like, this decaf pay thing is just, like, completely changed it.
00:10:28.594 - 00:10:46.194, Speaker C: We're now at a point where you can exist and transact using crypto. Not know it's crypto, and you're not using it for the sake of crypto. You're using it because it's actually a better product. Like, my favorite example is I drink a lot of coffee. Like, big surprise. We all work in crypto. We're all caffeine addicts.
00:10:46.194 - 00:11:20.644, Speaker C: And every day I buy coffee from the same shop, and we have, like, this little punch card, and I notoriously forget to, like, get my punch card punched, right? So it's like, what's a crypto use case there that can, like, fix that? You look at, like, payments on Solana, and you can bake in a system where every time you pay, you receive a CNFt back, right? Cnfts are cheap. We actually talked earlier. It's like, I'm sure we all saw the report. Like, what if Solana hit $3,000? Like, I wonder what it would cost to mint an NFT. It's like, well, if it was a normal NFT, it'd be $75 just to mint the thing. But with the cNft, it's $0.01 still.
00:11:20.644 - 00:11:29.844, Speaker C: So if you're a coffee shop, you can mint a ton of these things. It costs you nothing. And that's your loyalty program. You buy ten coffees. I don't have to remember. Like, I can show you my wallet. I think if I have it on me.
00:11:29.884 - 00:11:31.024, Speaker D: You left it there.
00:11:31.444 - 00:11:31.868, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:31.916 - 00:11:35.788, Speaker C: Let me see. This is. So I go to this coffee shop every day.
00:11:35.956 - 00:11:36.228, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:36.236 - 00:11:55.804, Speaker C: And I think I have one punch. Cause I forget every time. And it's like, we could bake it in. Where I buy my coffee, I receive the cnft for the loyalty program. And when I buy that tent coffee without even knowing it's free, they know because it can check the wallet and translate it, and then the sale goes through. It's just like, no more using crypto for payments for the sake of it being crypto. It's using because it's a better product.
00:11:55.804 - 00:11:58.348, Speaker C: That's just, like, got me most excited about vento right now.
00:11:58.516 - 00:12:21.894, Speaker A: That's pretty awesome. I'm curious, just to pull on that thread, what are some of the other reasons why merchants might want to do it? One example is people that are using the selected machines might be getting some other extras. But what are the other ideas that would help incentivize merchants to go beyond the loyalty and find different ways to justify, excuse me, using crypto payments?
00:12:23.074 - 00:12:23.934, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:12:24.474 - 00:13:19.884, Speaker B: I think if I can touch on that, because we come from a very long way of onboarding merchants back then, because I'm based in Singapore. So although we are a very crypto friendly industry, not a lot of merchants that accept crypto, I think that's the main thing, is that they want cash right away. So back to the thing is that if, let's say we were to onboard merchants with crypto, why Solana or why Webtree is because it has an international market, so they can immediately access. I think what we have did with Shopify is really cool. You can immediately buy goods, you can pay with crypto and stuff. And I think we have a bunch of merchants from selling accessories, pet products that can use Solana pay, assess the international market, assess the Solana committee that we have, and, you know, they can have the funds, and then we'll have, like, an off ramp that allows them to get their fiat into. Straight into their bank.
00:13:19.964 - 00:13:41.092, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I've heard of the international payment case for places like Japan, where they have a lot of tourists, and they want to participate in the digital money system there, but they can't because they don't live in Japan. They don't have the japanese bank accounts, but they're accepting crypto, then they'd be able to get that. And the merchant, you know, it settles in whatever, whatever they want. But I think that's a pretty cool use case.
00:13:41.228 - 00:14:54.782, Speaker D: Yeah. And I also think that another perspective of why merchants would want to accept crypto payments is if you focus in, for example, again, Latin America, these merchants will be getting payments, international payments, but holding their payments in us dollars, which means that they are protecting themselves from the valuation and inflation of their local currencies. And this is very important for them, because this is what people struggle a lot with. Currently, in places like Argentina, for example, people don't want to accept card because the money takes one month or arrives at the end of the month to their bank accounts, and by then it's worth maybe 20% less. So imagine if these merchants are able to get the money in USDC, then they protect themselves from inflation and the valuation, and then they can offer them whenever they are actually going to use the money. So this is, I think, a huge advantage and a reason why people and merchants should be interested on start accepting these crypto payments and also for us to develop these type of products that other people are interested in using. And not just stay in the Solana community, but getting out of it and getting everyday people to start adopting us.
00:14:54.782 - 00:15:46.934, Speaker D: Because actually makes sense, not because it's cool and because it actually saves them money, protects their wealth, everything. And also other cool thing that they could do is like, for example, I don't know if you saw the announce of etherfuse that now they are allowing stable bonds. That is basically through crypto, you invest in the mexican government in bonds. And this is super cool because, for example, as a merchant, you could be holding your value in us dollars, but then on the top of that, you can invest that money in a stable bond and then maybe making 11% on that money. So instead of losing so much money, you are actually making more. And that's why people should be interested on these technologies and adopting it, because it's really helpful and it's really cool. It's not just cool, it's like, you know what I mean?
00:15:47.094 - 00:15:47.574, Speaker C: It's real.
00:15:47.614 - 00:15:47.766, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:47.790 - 00:15:48.918, Speaker D: It's not a meme anymore.
00:15:48.966 - 00:15:49.494, Speaker C: It's awesome.
00:15:49.574 - 00:15:55.510, Speaker D: Now it's like, it actually has like a real, real impact in real world problems. Yeah.
00:15:55.582 - 00:16:19.994, Speaker A: Makes total sense. Kind of continuing off of this like, what are the obstacles? What are the things that need to happen? What is, I guess, maybe looking forward, how do we get to that world where a lot more countries are accepting it, that merchants want to accept this? Is it a ux thing? Is it just trust? How do we get to that point where everyone is ready and transacting with crypto all the time and maybe they don't even know it's.
00:16:19.994 - 00:17:02.104, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one part of it's going to be time. Right? And I also think a lot of the things that I see as blockers is like, very much like, I live in the states, right? And crypto is not nearly as widely adopted as some of the places that, like, decaf, has experience with. We're like, crypto is needed, and it was, like, needed yesterday, and you're seeing huge adoption there. So I think there's going to be time where people get more comfortable with crypto, and I really do think we're seeing it every day. It becomes less and less taboo to talk about it and people are more and more interested. But I think what it really boils down to is having an experience that feels natural and is providing benefits. And the issue there is always going to be adoption.
00:17:02.104 - 00:17:36.880, Speaker C: How do we have a conversation with a coffee shop and say, hey, I know you probably don't get asked this a lot, but you should probably start accepting crypto? And how do we get them a little bit more open to it and show them that this isn't going to turn away customers. It's actually a better product. The loyalty program's better. The fees are lower. I'm thinking about places even, like gas stations, where it's like, you go to purchase something and I don't know how many times I've walked away. When you walk in and there's a dollar five minimum, never mind, I'll just go keep pumping gas. I'm not going to spend $5.
00:17:36.880 - 00:17:55.324, Speaker C: All I wanted was gum. They don't have to do that anymore. There's no more minimums. Teaching them that, showing them that, showing them that's a reality, and it's not that difficult. And then again, it just really goes back to, we've done a lot of great work with the onramp. I'm really proud that we have, like, zero fees. It takes like, three minutes and you can start paying right away, but it's got to be even better than that.
00:17:55.324 - 00:18:16.172, Speaker C: It needs to be at a point where somebody can tap with a credit card and it gets swapped immediately into, like, USDC. The transaction happens on Solana, because it's just a better way to transact and then comes out the other end however they want it, using something maybe like decaf pay, where you actually get at the end of the day, like your digital fiat, if that's what you want. But, yeah, this education and showing people, like, it's worth the time and it's a better product.
00:18:16.348 - 00:18:18.084, Speaker B: Yeah, I. Can I add something?
00:18:18.164 - 00:18:18.836, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:18:18.980 - 00:19:00.304, Speaker B: I think I just want to add on to what Svik has said, and I think Venta is the solution, not only because, like, we have such an impressive tech set where, you know, our dream right from the start when we were building Monstra, is to make everything as seamless as possible, as easy as possible for, like, the merchants and for the consumers. And I think with Venta, what we have did here at breakpoint, using a band to pay with crypto on Solana, pay with the selector smart features, or, like, you know, with the barista who knew nothing, but they are able to operate like a pos. So simple for them. I think that's the dream. So, like, I think if anyone or any merchant out there that wants to try things, vantage the solution.
00:19:00.904 - 00:19:41.178, Speaker D: Yeah, well, I will also add something. Yeah. And I think that it's super important when people actually experience it and see that it is real. So an example is with decaf. My parents would never understand what was I doing. Like, they didn't get it till one day I told my cousin that lives in the US, she sends money every month to my mom to give it to her brother. So I told her, you know what? Now you can start using decaf, and then you will save money, and the money will get faster to my mom.
00:19:41.178 - 00:20:29.358, Speaker D: And then she actually did it. And in the moment that that happened, now, my parents were like, ah, it was like an aha moment. Like, now they actually get what is my business about what are we doing? And I think that the same will happen in the payments space. That when people start seeing that they can use crypto to pay for things, but also that there is an easy way to send that crypto that they got to their bank account or get cash, is when the switch will happen, and then people will start adopting it. And, I mean, we have been working on this for, like, two years now, and a big blocker that we saw was that the ecosystem wasn't there yet. Like, everyone was talking about nfts and things like that. No one was really focusing on real life problems.
00:20:29.358 - 00:21:23.404, Speaker D: But I think that now, two years later, the ecosystem has started to actually look at that, and we have seen, like, way more companies focus on payments on and off ramps, all of these stuff that are popping up every day. Like, sometimes we are like, oh, now that we have this new potential partner, this new potential partner, and then I think that is something that is helping a lot, because now there are more people focusing on that, which will make that it is easier for these businesses to own an off ramp because there are more partners. And if there are more partners, that means that the competition will be better. They will offer better rates. It's not predatory fees. It's not just, I don't know, Moonpay charging 9% to get on and off of the ecosystem. So I think that now we are getting into a moment where this is actually starting to make more sense.
00:21:24.284 - 00:21:48.584, Speaker A: Totally. I'm glad that your parents know what you do. My mom thinks I work at bitcoin, which is obviously true. Another question I have is, what is the dream scenario five years from now? Let's see. Where is Solanape? Where would be the coolest use of Solanape that doesn't exist today? It's open for anybody.
00:21:50.624 - 00:22:01.168, Speaker C: It's tough. I feel like for every cool use, Solana pig could exist. We just have to convince people to let us do it. That's kind of like my. My mentality. Like, we're looking at something like, breakpoint. The activation we have now.
00:22:01.168 - 00:22:41.802, Speaker C: Like, something I talk about a lot is, like, if anyone's familiar with, like, lollapalooza, like, way back, I guess. Way back, like, two years ago, which is, like, ancient days in crypto times, Solana was at Lala. And for anyone that's never been to, like, a music festival like that, but it's like, everything happens on these wristbands. It was kind of like, the inspiration here, where everything you're doing, you're tapping to pay, you sign in by tapping. I think it'd be awesome if that kind of stuff happens on chain. Like, going to an event like that where you're tapping to go places and you're tapping to pay, and it's like you're almost being tracked, but it's not attached to you because it's all on chain. They know you as, like, three x 483, lowercase j, whatever your wallet address is.
00:22:41.802 - 00:23:07.174, Speaker C: So you don't have to give personal information. They just know you that way, and you can actually do. It's, like, learn and, like, gain from experiences that way. Whether you're buying a beer, whether you're checking in, whether when you walk into a certain stage it's like, oh, you saw this band. Like, we will send your wallet an NFT. Like a poet for seeing them. Also, if you've seen like five of our concerts next time, you see us next year and you check in like, this hoodie's on us, like, you're a loyal fan, you can prove it.
00:23:07.174 - 00:23:29.686, Speaker C: It's like back in the seventies, like, they used to have like, these, like, classic rock clubs where it's like, if you were like a big fan, you could sit in certain sections and stuff and it's like, that's kind of gone now. But, like, you could bring stuff like that back. You can bring back, like, very real, tangible loyalty programs where it's not a punch card. You can lose, like I do every three minutes. It's like part of you, but it's still anonymous. Like, that's something that gets me personally really pumped.
00:23:29.830 - 00:23:49.128, Speaker A: I've heard a lot of big brands where that's actually a big problem, is that they have so many touch points across different mediums. Being in person, all this sorts of stuff, and this is where we sell them as well, is basically, hey, you can have digital assets and they can add up to something else more meaningful in a way that you can engage more closely with the customer. So totally, totally aligned.
00:23:49.256 - 00:23:49.632, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:49.688 - 00:23:54.444, Speaker A: How about you guys? What are the things that you would love to see Solana pay be a part of?
00:23:54.784 - 00:25:10.926, Speaker D: I mean, I would like to see more adoption in, like, everyday people that, for example, you go to the store and then you pay with USDC, but that person doesn't even have to off ramp to a bank account or get the cash out and go back again to the same system, but just keep that money and then use that money to pay for other stuff. And you know what I mean? Like, get to this level where crypto is so adopted that it is just in the same ecosystem. And then people can transfer money internationally, can pay for things in the grocery store, and they don't have to be, again, going back to the same system and paying for fees and all of this. So that is what I would like to see, that money is being moved. Like Internet. Like, being able to move money as easy as it is to send a text message on Internet and being able to use it not just to transfer, but also from one country to another, but also to pay at your store, at the supermarket, and then have like, this circular economy in crypto where people have more ownership of their money and don't have to be paying these predatory fees. That's my ideal scenario.
00:25:11.030 - 00:25:15.862, Speaker A: It makes total sense. I have a venmo balance that I never off ramp. It's just sitting in there doing literally.
00:25:15.918 - 00:25:17.286, Speaker C: I think we all do, right?
00:25:17.350 - 00:25:20.270, Speaker A: And so, yeah, it could be much, much, much better.
00:25:20.382 - 00:26:01.786, Speaker B: I think for me, it may be like, it may feel like I'm dreaming a little bit, but I think we can all dream a little. So I was thinking, because I come way back from events like managing coplay concerts, like UFC and stuff, I think my ideal world would be having this bands using crypto, doing event check ins, doing registrations, and then you can type to when you check in and check out, and then you can also pay as you go pay with your merchants. I want it to be as seamless as possible where you can. You literally feel like it's just another daily thing. Like, you can take trains with it. You can spend at, like, a food court.
00:26:01.850 - 00:26:14.746, Speaker A: And so, yeah, I totally agree. I think that, like, Solanapay has so many different capabilities. We could use it for, well, more than just payments, right? It can just be tickets. It can be all sorts of different things.
00:26:14.890 - 00:26:15.654, Speaker D: Yep.
00:26:16.634 - 00:26:50.474, Speaker A: So we have about three minutes left. If there's any questions in the audience, we'd be happy to take one or two. Any takers? Yeah. What's the most crypto friendly jurisdiction? If I were to count today, which country would you count in? My company was truly accepted. Just to repeat the question, it is, what is the most crypto friendly jurisdiction for you to found your company if you are accepting crypto payments? Is that correct? Okay, does anyone know?
00:26:50.854 - 00:26:54.274, Speaker D: That's a good question because we are still trying to figure out.
00:26:54.734 - 00:26:57.234, Speaker C: Yeah, let me know when you find out and we'll join you.
00:26:58.094 - 00:27:23.956, Speaker D: We have been thinking about this for more than one year now, and we're still like, I don't know, maybe if you want to talk to Rick, he's the one in the team that is now investigating. He can tell you about every country and what are his findings. But, yeah, it is a tough questions, and it depends a lot on each company. What are you like, what is your business? What do you want? Are you in the US? You are in, I don't know, many things.
00:27:24.060 - 00:27:53.360, Speaker A: One thing I've found, too, is that depending on where you're operating, you do need to pay taxes. It's not a way to get away from taxes. Even in the context of the vending machines, the money has to go to different areas. Even though crypto peer to peer payments may be simple, operating with merchants and all them, they have their own restrictions, too. Some folks cannot hold soul for whatever reason, they only can do USDC. Sometimes they have to pay taxes. So it's also important to understand the local regulations too.
00:27:53.360 - 00:28:07.334, Speaker A: It's not just peer to peer for everything. Probably take one more question if there's other things. Awesome. Cool. Well, thank you so much for talking about Solanape.
00:28:07.424 - 00:28:07.794, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:28:07.834 - 00:28:08.154, Speaker A: Thank you.
