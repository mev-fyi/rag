00:00:00.320 - 00:00:29.468, Speaker A: Hello everybody. Solana transactions have three different commitment statuses. There is finalized which means that there is 31 blocks being built on top of the block your transaction is in. Then there is confirmed which means 66% of stake already voted for your block and there has never been a confirmed block which did not finalize in the end. And then there's processed which has a tiny chance that your transaction doesn't land on the current block. But then your RPC will just retry it and it will land eventually or when the block has exposed fired it will fail. So lets look at a real life example here.
00:00:29.468 - 00:00:56.036, Speaker A: So I am doing a few transactions and you can see that Im getting the processed one already after 230 milliseconds. This is due to the dragon mouth plugin running on my RPC. So ask your RPC if they already support mid block transaction updates then theres confirmed which takes one block so around 450 milliseconds and then theres finalized which takes 31 times 400 milliseconds so around 12 seconds so its totally fine to use confirmed so try it out and see you guys next time. Bye.
