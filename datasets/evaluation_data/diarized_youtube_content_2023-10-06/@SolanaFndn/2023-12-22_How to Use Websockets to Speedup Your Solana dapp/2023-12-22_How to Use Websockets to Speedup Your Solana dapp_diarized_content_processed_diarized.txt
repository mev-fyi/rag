00:00:00.200 - 00:00:24.966, Speaker A: Hello everybody, today I want to show you one of my favorite Solana features which is websocket connections. So here I have a JavaScript client and you can see as soon as I chop a tree here in the JavaScript client I also directly see the update in the unity client and this is done via a websocket connection. So in JavaScript this is actually super easy to do, you just do a connection on account change and then the address to your account and then as soon as this account changes on chain you will immediately get the data pushed.
00:00:24.990 - 00:00:26.246, Speaker B: In here and you can directly use.
00:00:26.270 - 00:00:38.792, Speaker A: It and you can do the same thing also in unity or in c sharp you just use your anchor client, you subscribe to your account and then as soon as the data changes you get it pushed in here. So I think this opens tons of cool functionality.
00:00:38.848 - 00:00:40.016, Speaker C: For your apps so try.
00:00:40.040 - 00:00:42.296, Speaker A: It out and make them a little bit faster today. Bye.
