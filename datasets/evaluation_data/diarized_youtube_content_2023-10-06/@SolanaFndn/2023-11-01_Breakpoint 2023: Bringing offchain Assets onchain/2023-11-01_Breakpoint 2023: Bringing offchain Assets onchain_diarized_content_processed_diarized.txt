00:00:03.720 - 00:00:15.274, Speaker A: All right. I love the energy out here. Thanks for keeping it up for everybody here on day two. I love it. Thanks everybody. I am Ben Sprango. I am the head of strategic bd at the Solana foundation.
00:00:15.274 - 00:00:31.896, Speaker A: I'm here joined with an awesome, very large panel today. Looking forward to talking about off chain assets, otherwise known as RWAs. First, I'm going to go down the line and have everybody introduce themselves and the projects that they're working on, starting with maximum. Perfect.
00:00:31.960 - 00:00:45.804, Speaker B: So Maxim Pisa, you call me Max, CTO and one of the co founders of Credx. And what we are doing is really reinventing how debt, capital markets and private credit work and we leverage Solana for that. But more on that later.
00:00:46.224 - 00:00:55.444, Speaker C: I'm Svi Weisel. I'm the co founder and CEO of Baxis and we are focused on the wine and spirits industry and how we can bring that on chain for increased liquidity.
00:00:58.004 - 00:01:07.664, Speaker D: Thanks for being everyone. I'm Trevor Bacon, the co founder and CEO of Parcel, which is a decentralized exchange focused on perpetual futures contracts in real estate.
00:01:08.804 - 00:01:19.664, Speaker E: Hi everyone, I'm Mary. I'm one of the co founders of Bridgesplit and we provide the technology, compliance and capital for other platforms to offer collateralized financing to their users.
00:01:21.124 - 00:01:34.334, Speaker F: My name is Adam. I'm part of the Rockaway team. We are investors in the space through our VC fund and credit fund, but we are also builders. We are behind projects like Observatory Zone and stake bar and smart delegation program.
00:01:36.954 - 00:01:43.894, Speaker G: Hey everyone, I'm Domingo, one of the co founders and CEO of Homebase. We let people invest in fractionalized residential real estate for as little as $100.
00:01:45.154 - 00:02:08.070, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, guys. All right, so I'm going to start with the most niche or newest products up here on the stage. When people think of RwAs, a lot of talk about credit, things that already exist in the current financial system. Todd, I'm going to kick it over to you first to talk about Baxis just because you guys recently launched, so can you give the crowd a little idea about what you're doing with Baxis?
00:02:08.182 - 00:02:33.598, Speaker C: Sure. So when you look at the total global wine and spirits market, somewhere between $801,000,000,001.3 trillion. Most people don't even know that. That number seems really crazy. But you think about the amount of wine, the amount of alcohol that sits in a liquor store, the amount of stuff that's sitting in a vineyard, sitting in a distillery, of that $56 billion is sitting in people's basements right now. Collectible wine, collectible spirits.
00:02:33.598 - 00:02:56.254, Speaker C: And the issue with all of these assets is they're highly valuable. They increase in price, they move opposite in the direction of the economy. They're known as safe havens of wealth. They're illiquid. You have to find the right buyer. You have to find the right seller. And more importantly than anything else, you can't just pack it up into a little cardboard box and ship it to someone across the country like you could necessarily a baseball card.
00:02:56.254 - 00:03:34.638, Speaker C: You have liquor laws. You have international tariffs about alcohol regulation, and most importantly, you have risk. The bottles themselves. Is this a real authentic bottle of whiskey that I'm buying? Is this the real bottle of wine that I'm buying? So when you take kind of all of those factors, you take the price discovery issues and you take this merging of buyers and sellers. I mean, we look at crypto and we look at what crypto has done for all types of markets around the world, and we say, okay, how do we take that same technology, provide the custodial services, the tokenization, and then open up $56 billion of liquidity just for the stuff that's already sitting in people's homes? So really, that's what we're. I mean, that's what we're doing at Baxis. We actually vault people's bottles.
00:03:34.638 - 00:03:49.648, Speaker C: We authenticate them, we scan them, we tokenize them, we give them all the information, pricing history, so that people get a better understanding of how much is my collection worth, how much can I sell it for? And just bringing that marriage between those buyers and sellers into one place specifically.
00:03:49.776 - 00:04:11.908, Speaker A: On that, what other things does that enable thereafter? So, one of the things that we have talked at length about is capital efficiency of these assets. And that's why I'm particularly interested in what you're doing with Baxis is previously, you have no way to account for these types of assets. They just sit in a vault or they sit somewhere, and that's what they are. They're a collector's item. But what can you do now with the technology that you're building?
00:04:11.996 - 00:04:54.184, Speaker C: Yeah, and I mean, this is the reason that we built this out on blockchain to begin with, is the composability element. So it's the fact that you now have these bottles that are verified, you know where they are. You know, we're working with helium to actually put the trackers on them. So not only do you know the GPS location, but, you know, the temperature, the humidity, you can actually monitor the actual, like, you know, life cycle of the barrel of whiskey, the bottle of wine. And what you're able to do on top of that is actually build out more efficient capital markets. You're able to build out lending products. And that's actually something that we're working on with Mary at Bridge split is rolling out like a really cool kind of capital and efficiency way for a distillery, let's say, which has all of their upfront costs, making the whiskey, putting it into the barrels, and letting it sit for six years, 20 years, 30 years.
00:04:54.184 - 00:05:50.830, Speaker C: They have no access to capital while that stuff is sitting there. So what they traditionally have ended up doing is selling off the barrels to private equity firms who sell it back to them in 60 years at a 400% markup. So it's great for the private equity guys, it's pretty bad terms for the distilleries, but hey, they take the money where they can get it. What Baxis does with these kind of more capital efficient markets, and that transparency is it allows for a platform like bridge split to come in, for us to tokenize the assets, for bridgesplit, to bring in their lenders and their capital, and to start to say, hey, we'll lend you money for 15% interest. So you're paying a lot less money to be able to actually physically own and store and hold those assets when they're ready to bottle. There's a lot more profit in it for the distilleries, which means more distillers are able to open, more brands are able to get quicker access to capital. It basically takes this trillion dollar global market, which has been around for thousands of years on the wine side and hundreds of years on the whiskey side, and it brings it into the 21st century.
00:05:51.022 - 00:05:56.254, Speaker A: Perfect segue over to Mary to talk about the infrastructure you guys are building to support some of this stuff.
00:05:56.414 - 00:07:03.650, Speaker E: Yeah, that was a great segue. Like Todd mentioned, we're focused on the financing infrastructure that kind of manages and escrows the collateral and the capital, to let those end users borrow against those assets. And what we're excited about is the emergence of platforms like Baxis, focused on these new, what we call like, primitive asset classes. So these are asset classes that are relatively unfinancialized compared to some other asset class. And so you're not asking them to change their behavior or change the product that they're using to access financing, but rather you're giving them a brand new thing that they weren't able to access before. So, like Todd said, with these distilleries, who before didn't even have the ability to account for that collateral and access affordable financing are suddenly able to do so as a function of these assets existing on chain in a trusted way. And so that's what we've been focusing on, is working with these different platforms that secure, serve not only as a distribution channel for borrowers and folks that have these assets, but also as a liquidation venue.
00:07:03.650 - 00:07:23.414, Speaker E: And so you're now able to price this collateral and manage this collateral in a way that banks in traditional finance can only do for like one type of real estate effectively. And so you're able to serve a much broader group of businesses and customers and give them access to affordable financing with the value that they have.
00:07:23.964 - 00:07:29.348, Speaker A: Can you give the audience an idea of what other types of projects that you guys are working with in addition to Baxis?
00:07:29.436 - 00:08:11.504, Speaker E: Yeah, so there's a wide variety. It includes both tangible assets like spirits and intangible assets like intellectual property. A new company that we have started to work with XP, who I think was on the stage a few days ago, they're working on tokenizing sports tickets, which is also surprisingly like an analogous use case to spirits and spirits brokers. You'll have folks that are buying season tickets that are $100,000 at the start of the year and need to finance them and make money over the course of the year to pay that off. And so you have these different financial participants in these markets with assets that have clear value in secondary markets and just no way to recognize that value in a traditional financial system.
00:08:12.364 - 00:08:42.674, Speaker A: Awesome. All right, well, I'm going to shift gears over to a topic that is very near and dear to my heart and also to my father, who I hope is watching at home. Dad, that would be real estate. I'm going to start with you, Domingo, down there. Give us an idea of what homebase is doing and the progress that you guys have made, specifically over the last six months and what you guys are looking forward to in the fractionalized real estate space and how you're giving access to an asset class that has been traditionally guarded from a lot of the population.
00:08:43.384 - 00:09:19.072, Speaker G: Yeah, I mean, a big motivation for even wanting to launch a company like homebase. And I think it's a sad future of where the state of the world's going, where you have to fractionalize real estate to make it affordable for people. But a big thesis behind this was just real estate's gotten way too dang affordable, not only in the US, but even across worldwide. And like my parents came to the US, literally came with nothing, were able to buy property. I worked at Google for five years could not afford anything in the Bay Area and I was like, this is nuts. What can we do to make this more affordable for people? And so that was a big piece of why we even launched homebase. Just giving people access to residential real estate.
00:09:19.072 - 00:10:09.964, Speaker G: A NASA class that gives dividends stable. If you look at just us housing prices that gone up like over three x over the last 30 years, and it's just something that not that many people can access, especially now where interest rates are around 8%. And so a big piece of home base is just giving people access to this, to residential real estate. In the US right now it's limited to just us investors, but we're planning on broadening it up to LATAM investors as well, potentially working with an exchange and giving a lot more liquidity to residential real estate. But a big piece of how that works in the US, there's a lot of us regulation around securities law. Is this reg d? Is this Reg A? And that's all just jargon for us, securities regulation. I'm sure everyone's seen Gary Gensler and the SEC around that, but just making sure complying with what they consider securities or not.
00:10:09.964 - 00:10:48.668, Speaker G: So for us, it's really just like 70% of our user base is new to real estate investing and got access to that through homebase. So that's something we're really proud of. Over the last six months, we've tokenized two houses, getting ready for our next looking at making it more scalable. But a big piece of it is just adding liquidity to something that is quite illiquid. Takes about like where we have properties, takes about 70 days to sell a house. You can imagine if these shares were in a public blockchain, there could be a lot more liquidity. Working with bridge, split and Mary to provide collateralized loans on these assets, I think the opportunities really open up once these assets are on chain.
00:10:48.668 - 00:10:49.624, Speaker G: Awesome.
00:10:50.364 - 00:11:09.006, Speaker A: Trevor, I'm going to kick off to you. I think that you're working on a particularly interesting tangent to the real estate market, where it allows you to get some kind of exposure to the real estate market without the specific ownership stuff that David Go has been talking about. So can you give a little bit more about parcel and the progress you guys have had?
00:11:09.110 - 00:11:54.424, Speaker D: Yeah. So parcel is not touching the physical layer of real estate. What we've done is created price indexes that track the price per square foot based on sales and listings. So basically that is, I guess, the, the pricing information or the spot price of real estate. If you think about the price points that are being offered to view to users. So every day, a subsidiary of Parcel called Parcel Labs takes in all this information, aggregates to a median price per square foot. That price per square foot is stamped through an oracle and into the trading platform where users can go long and short with leverage in a perpetual futures contract.
00:11:55.284 - 00:12:16.344, Speaker A: Awesome. So given that you guys have been around about, I think we met in 2021, it's been a long while, long path to get here. A lot of progress that's been made. What have you seen from a user perspective over that period of time versus how you originally viewed your user and how the user is actually using the platform today?
00:12:17.504 - 00:13:04.084, Speaker D: Yeah, so, you know, it took a while. The data here is quite an undertaking and we've made tremendous progress on that. Think of it like a next generation case Shiller index, and we're in the US today and in the UK as well, and parts of France in terms of price indexes. So that took about a year to get up. And we've had a couple versions of the product. We just finished up the second version and saw a pretty big uptick over the last three months in terms, terms of, of notional dollars traded versus the prior three months, so doing about a million dollars in notional volume a month. What we've learned is the market wants spot real estate prices, which don't exist except for what we offer.
00:13:04.084 - 00:13:48.878, Speaker D: They also want more liquidity and dynamic fee structures. So what we've been working on over the last, call it three months, is creating a more scalable architecture to allow larger tickets, more sophisticated traders and institutions to come in and get exposure to either speculate or create products, to retail or to hedge for people that are long real estate. When you think about the vast majority, there's really no way to short specific market in real estate except for through like mortgage security. So this does offer a localized product for people to mitigate risk and diversify risk.
00:13:49.006 - 00:14:10.556, Speaker A: Awesome. All right, let's shift gears over to the credit side. Max, I'm going to kick it over to you. Would love to hear a little bit about the credits thesis and also the progress that you guys have had. I know the receivables pool as of late was your most recent product, but tell us a little bit more about the impetus around creating the company and where you guys are today.
00:14:10.700 - 00:14:49.520, Speaker B: I have to do so. So, in what our mission is to connect institutional investors with credit opportunities, it's one thing. Second thing is that we also want to give them their money back. So we want to have risk adjusted returns achieved by robust underwriting, how we call it. And then lastly, we want to do that in a scalable way by really using the most advanced technologies, like Solana, for example. So those are three things, and that's also where we started. So at the first one, connecting those institutional investors, institutional investors, they also have institutional regulations.
00:14:49.520 - 00:15:19.960, Speaker B: So we focused a lot on building a legal infrastructure. And we have investors mainly from the US, we have investments. So credit fintechs in Brazil. So we set up this whole legal infrastructure to make that very sound. Then second thing is at the robust underwriting, you need to have a local team as well. In Brazil, you cannot just build a technology and expect that everything will go well, because every local market has our local problems and local people understand those and can solve those. So we set that up as well.
00:15:19.960 - 00:15:55.722, Speaker B: And then lastly, using very advanced technologies like Solana to achieve scale. That was really where we made a difference, not where we improved how it currently works by 1.5 times, it's really by hundreds of times. So may I give an example how traditional credit investments work? Let's say you have several investors, institutional investors in us, they want to invest in a credit product. They would have to go through a trust, they all invest, then they issue notes, they have to go to a depository to deposit the notes, etcetera. So that already takes a very long time. Then the funds have to move to Brazil.
00:15:55.722 - 00:16:26.104, Speaker B: That's through the very famous and fun swift network. Takes a lot of time, costs a lot of money, can go wrong. And then there you have to do a VIX transaction, then you have to off ramp it, and then your borrower can start using the funds. Now with Credx, what we actually do is that we tokenize this securitized asset. So it's really a structured product that we put on chain. So it's not just issuing tokens, but there is also a lot of data on chain. Then investors invest using USDC at the same time.
00:16:26.104 - 00:16:55.162, Speaker B: They get their tokens. Then we actually off ramp the USDC straight into Brazil. So our fintechs, our borrowers, don't even need a dollar bank account, they can go through an exchange and get it in their bank account. So that's already super efficient. Then every month, of course, there needs to be a repayment to go back to the investors. And that is really funny. If you look at the traditional world, there you have like a calculation agent that has their very sophisticated excels, do all the calculations.
00:16:55.162 - 00:17:19.266, Speaker B: Then they call with a paying agent to say how much should be transferred to every investor, depending on the risk laws they're in, then the investors have to say that they agree to those amounts. Then the paying agent actually makes the transfers. Then oftentimes that goes wrong. So then you have to reconcile, you have to correct all of those things. And that is what we now do in 300 milliseconds. Only possible on Solana.
00:17:19.330 - 00:17:45.258, Speaker A: I would say that was a fantastic overview of the disintermediation of Credx here to drive the point home for the audience, since I am most familiar with the receivables pool, give an idea of the market dynamics for that product. You have customers who need access to capital in Latin America who are getting quoted what APR from their banks.
00:17:45.346 - 00:17:48.570, Speaker B: It's between 30 and 200%.
00:17:48.722 - 00:17:51.914, Speaker A: And what is the APR that they're getting by using Credx?
00:17:52.074 - 00:17:55.214, Speaker B: So there we provide that 15%.
00:17:55.674 - 00:18:13.822, Speaker A: There you go. I think that's all that needs to be said on that. I am going to kick it over to Adam. Adam, backstage we were talking a little bit about rather than bringing rwas to blockchain, let's bring blockchains to rwas. Can you talk a little bit more about that and what you guys are focusing on over at Rockaway?
00:18:13.998 - 00:19:06.200, Speaker F: Sure. I think like lately, what we have or what we see, a lot of it, you know, with the real world assets is basically we have this front page infrastructure where you're moving funds kind of out of blockchain. But what I would like to see more is, for example, are we able to use native tokens or stake native tokens, something which can solve problems in the real world. I think, for example, very good use case is insurance and reinsurance business. So the idea is basically, if you are able to solve the hedging problems, which I think you are able for really liquid tokens, you can use derivatives. And for less liquid tokens, you could use, for example, tranches. If you are able to solve this problem, then you could use actually stake native tokens and double the yield and solve the problem for insurance companies.
00:19:06.200 - 00:19:52.734, Speaker F: Because insurance companies, to issue insurance policies, they need additional money. And the money are usually just like somewhere lying idle. Usually the insurance companies or insurance companies invest them into treasuries, they generate additional yield. But usually these money are not used or only portion of those money is used. So if you were able to actually structure the product the way that you could use native tokens or even better, stake native tokens as a collateral for insurance companies, I think this is some use case which would finally, which blockchain and the native tokens could actually bring to the real world. So this is something we are looking at right now. We are already talking to insurance company, which is interested in it and they are able to accept native tokens as a collateral.
00:19:52.734 - 00:19:59.164, Speaker F: So if somebody wants to talk about it or participate in it, I'll be happy to discuss.
00:19:59.784 - 00:20:42.000, Speaker A: I think that's a really good segue into what I want to talk about for the second half of the talk here is everyone here is working on something really interesting that I think is providing immediate value, which is apparent from the conversation. There are issues that everyone is running into and I would say that probably 75% of them have to do with the government from that panel that we just all experienced. I would love to hear a little bit from you guys. What kind of processes have you had to go through to build these products and what roadblocks, what things need to change in order for you to really proliferate the businesses that you're working on. So maybe, Adam, I could start with you on the insurance side. What kind of stuff goes into insurance regulation when it comes to launching a product like that?
00:20:42.072 - 00:21:23.404, Speaker F: I mean, first you need to have the insurance company to be comfortable with native token as collateral. Because if you think about it, native tokens are super volatile and they need something what is like dollar equivalent, then you need to pursue it. The regulator that basically you can manage the risk and that the money will stay on chain and that the money will not go anywhere. So like most of the insurance companies there in Bermuda, so like the regulator there is quite open and you can actually talk to them, but they apply LTV to each token. They look how the token is liquid. How big is the token? Of course, the most LTV you have for bitcoin. And then when you go down the chain then it's like, you know, lower and lower and lower.
00:21:23.404 - 00:21:51.808, Speaker F: So I think this is the most important issue you deal with. And yeah, then it's up to the insurance company to have all the insurance licenses which they usually have. So. But if you want to build a reinsurance company from scratch, then you're just going through one year talking to lawyers and establish to get license and everything. So I mean, it's much more easier to partner already with somebody who has that and then just basically scale it.
00:21:51.896 - 00:22:05.764, Speaker A: Yeah. Domingo, I'm going to go back to you and then to trevor since I feel like you guys have two sides of a similar coin here when it comes to fractionalizing real estate and offering that to retail. What all goes into that from a legal perspective?
00:22:06.514 - 00:22:22.946, Speaker G: Yeah, I think for us it's really about following us securities regulation. And so there's so many different pathways. You can go down that rabbit hole. You do like a reg d offering which is a private placement. You basically don't let the government know that you're doing this. But you do file with the Sec. It's not as big of an IPO.
00:22:22.946 - 00:23:19.316, Speaker G: And there you're limited with how many non accredited investors you can have or accredited. And the way they define accreditation in the US is do you have a million dollars in net worth or do you make 250,000 per year? I think a lot of people in crypto aren't accredited investors, myself included. So can I even get access to my own product? And so a piece of this as well is as you do a Reg D, there's different sides to it. Like 506 B or C. Can you do general solicitation with that? So these are all quite nuanced but they matter because as these things get traded and you're doing AML checks on people and you're doing KYC checks on people, you have to make sure that who holds those tokens actually didn't launder the money to buy these tokens. You actually know who they are as a customer because you as a company are liable if some of these tokens go into the wrong hands. And so when it comes at least to real assets like real estate, I think getting to truly defi is tough.
00:23:19.316 - 00:23:52.970, Speaker G: At least in today's like in the US today, just due to how much compliance you have to do as a company. And even when it comes to accounting for that and giving everyone their taxes and k one s at the end of the year when it comes to secondary trading, you then need to start looking into broker dealer licenses. Do you have an ATS or an alternative trading system license to allow for trading on these securities? So we've been able to get around a lot of that just through those exemptions. Won't dive into the details for that. I'm happy to talk about it after this, but a lot of talks with lawyers. A lot of money to lawyers.
00:23:53.092 - 00:24:15.630, Speaker A: Yeah trevor. So in a similar vein, yours could effectively be classified as a derivative of a physical asset. So what goes into allowing that asset? I know that for example, the user interface of parcel is restricted in the United States and there's definitely a reason for that.
00:24:15.702 - 00:24:44.350, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. There's just no clear regulation for us to follow. So you know if there were, we'd love to, we were, we were going down the path of. You were pretty far down the path of being regulated in the Bahamas. But, you know, that kind of went out the door last year, so we. We decided to just pause on that. And then the environment just moved so quickly across various jurisdictions.
00:24:44.350 - 00:25:45.162, Speaker D: You have London or England making progress, Dubai, other places. But, you know, if you go too far down one path without, you end up. Just given how fast it's moving and how unclear it is, you end up spending needless amounts on lawyers. So it's almost more prudent to take a wait and see approach and just play conservative and do what you can. I mean, we incorporate AML stuff for sure on every wallet that connects. And then we have a hunch that anything in the US will require some form of KYC. There's some other headwinds on the back end where institutions who want to actually participate and interact with DeFi protocols, their insurance fees or compliance fees are greater, like much higher premium.
00:25:45.162 - 00:26:00.214, Speaker D: So I think once some form of regulation across, like, the major geographies comes into play, the cost to enter will go down and people can operate more efficiently and market more efficiently.
00:26:00.514 - 00:26:05.254, Speaker A: Is the fee disparity due to the fact that it's just crypto related?
00:26:06.234 - 00:26:13.424, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, pretty much. Just unknown counterparties. Pretty much.
00:26:14.644 - 00:26:27.464, Speaker A: Max, on the credit side, I feel like you have your own host of things that you guys have had to deal with. The credits platform is fairly well built at this point, so give us an idea of what that process has been like.
00:26:30.084 - 00:27:08.876, Speaker B: Yeah, we started very simple and then expanded in more technical terms. Everyone here knows a liquidity pool. That's what we built up as a first thing. Then we could bring a very simple, structured investment, live in that, like a bullet loan, where you just pay interest at the end, you pay the principal. Only one type of risk loss therein. And then you start talking to both sides of the market, and you get to know all the intricacies of credit. And slowly we started adding those and those and those, and now we have a pretty complete platform that can have different waterfall configurations, different risk, loss of investors, different kinds of schedules.
00:27:08.876 - 00:27:22.340, Speaker B: You can have a revolving phase where you reinvest. You can have an amortization phase. So it's very, very. Let's not say complex, but well rounded now, but I always advise to start very simple, get feedback, and then iterate.
00:27:22.372 - 00:27:38.182, Speaker A: On that, and specifically with interfacing with regulators. As you built that, was it a step by step process. You said, hey, here's what it looks like. Now. Are you okay with this? And you incrementally moved up the chain to make it into what it is today.
00:27:38.318 - 00:28:25.034, Speaker B: I think the good thing with our field that we operate in is that it's pretty established in traditional world. We're just making it more efficient. So there are rules, so we know the rules of the game and we complied with them. Of course, then we have the stablecoin aspect that comes into play. So there we work very closely together with the central bank in Brazil and also with the Sevian, which is a local sec. So that is also something I would advise if you do really innovative things, try to be close to those organizations. They all have sandboxes in which you can apply, then you can try out things without having to go out of business, and then you can grow together because they also want to learn, they want to regulate all of this, but they, they can only do that by looking at real use cases which are sitting here in the audience.
00:28:25.154 - 00:28:34.378, Speaker A: Sure. And Mary, from an infrastructure perspective on this, how are you guys tackling compliance on bringing rwas on chain?
00:28:34.546 - 00:29:24.454, Speaker E: Yeah. So similarly, the loan space is a little bit more defined and you don't have, we're facilitating bilateral loans like single borrower, single lender. So there's were mostly subject to lending regulation, which while onerous, is better defined. And those regulations actually are primarily about protecting borrowers against unreasonable interest rates. And so as a byproduct of us focusing on collateralized loans and trying to bring down traditional interest rates, they were generally protected from those. Like you said, there's still a lot to do at the platform level to be able to facilitate these loans in a compliant way. And so right now on our platform, all borrowers and lenders go through a Kyc or KyB process.
00:29:24.454 - 00:30:13.794, Speaker E: And actually all of the loans, like in addition to, obviously there's a smart contract enforcement of the different payment schedules and the defaults, but it also kind of has this parallel legally enforceable element to it where the borrower and the lender are signing a legal agreement that is enforceable in a court, a lien is filed on the collateral, which I think is kind of in contrast to a lot of decentralized applications today where you are escrowing that collateral and it goes to the lender. And I think that works in all of your best case scenarios. But in a world where a borrower says this collateral is mine or there's a law, a lawsuit that follows or something, you need to have all of those filings in place to actually ensure that the lender can get their money back.
00:30:13.914 - 00:30:24.962, Speaker A: Sure. Todd, admittedly, I don't know anything about the regulation around the high end spirits market. So I would love to hear a little bit about what that process has been like for you guys.
00:30:25.058 - 00:30:56.514, Speaker C: Yeah. So to kick it off, I mean, when we were first launching, we were looking into, do we do fractionalization of casks, do we do co ownership? And then you get into the reg, DS, the reg as all of these things. And we're like, okay, we're going to avoid the SEC for now. We're going to stick with the TTB. We're going to stick with the ABC, the alcoholic beverage commissions. And what's a little bit complex about the United States is that most of the alcohol laws and regulations that exist were actually enacted at the repeal of prohibition, and they haven't been updated since. So if we think that finance laws are outdated, like, wait till you look at alcohol.
00:30:56.514 - 00:31:44.850, Speaker C: And what we ended up finding over there was that you're not really, you're actually dealing with 51 independent districts, you know, like individual laws, because each state plus DC has their own laws. So how they interact with each other, who is actually able to ship alcohol? Who isn't? And so it was a lot more on the navigating the complexities of liquor laws. So, you know, our company holding liquor licenses, how many can we hold? Can we hold them in these states? Like, does it have to be held by an individual or a corporation? Like all of those little complexities. Complexities, because at the end of the day, in order to avoid some of these bigger things is we're not selling investment products, we're not selling tokens that have promises of future or whatever it is. You're buying a bottle of alcohol, you're buying a barrel of alcohol. If you want to drink it, you can redeem it. Again, assuming your state allows us to ship the alcohol to you, we can ship it directly to you.
00:31:44.850 - 00:32:29.032, Speaker C: If they don't, you can redeem it from one of the vaults itself. And so there's all those kind of more complexities about the actual physical goods, how we get them in, how we get them out, a lot less on the investment side, because again, while these things have a tremendous amount of value and we're looking at billions and billions of dollars, they're not, you know, it's not being traded in the same way. It's not being treated like somebody's treating it like purely an investment, you know, an investment or an investment vehicle. So that side has been kind of interesting for us. And even that took time because when we went to, you know, alcohol and beverage, beverage attorneys and we kind of presented to them how we're working in our model. They kind of looked at us and they're like, can you draw this for us? Like, we had to literally draw it out on a piece of paper because they're like, yeah, we're used to somebody coming in and saying, I'd like to open a liquor store on this, in this corner. Can I get a license here? And we're like, yeah, I'm looking to open a liquor store on this.
00:32:29.032 - 00:33:27.254, Speaker C: And this sector of the blockchain. Can we get a license over here? And so that was like a very, very different kind of pitch and explanation to them. But ultimately, that was one of the things that we really looked into, is how do we take, again, the benefits of blockchain and that ability for people to connect with buyers and sellers all over the world to get transparency and pricing, because that's one of the biggest issues, is just the lack of transparency and then even looking into partnering with Bridgesplit because we don't want to look into having to handle the lending laws itself and all of those criteria working with Neoswap, because they're building up these smart auctions that allow for people to trade bottles for bottle value, really building out these kind of smart systems, which is one of those things that's only possible on Solana and only possible, really, on blockchain in general, is being able to be able to give people that type of freedom as if this asset was just as mobile as if it was sitting in their home. But with the extra risk that your brother in law doesn't come over and drink a $5,000 bottle of bourbon and kill your investment.
00:33:27.414 - 00:33:59.546, Speaker A: Sure. Before we move on, I want to specifically touch on a key point that you had mentioned earlier about your integration with helium and how you guys are using that within the vault. Whenever I talk to people about long tail asset tokenization, one of the biggest things is knowing the condition of the item as it is in the vault. And that has always been the sticking point for a lot of people. Oh, you need to use some sort of centralized service to know how it is in the vault. Can you talk a little bit about the helium integration and how that effectively makes your entire product decentralized?
00:33:59.650 - 00:34:41.326, Speaker C: Yeah. So we kind of like our first co working space. We got started at Empire Dow in New York City, and while we were sitting there, like, we were discussing how do we build out? Do we work with an oracle network? Do we verify the information? Do we verify the data? How does somebody trust us that this bottle is sitting there that the temperature and humidity are what we say they are, and we're at a happy hour, and all of a sudden I meet this guy from helium and he's like, yeah, we built out this Lorawan system and you can tag things and track temperature. And I immediately ran upstairs and grabbed my co founder and CTO, Carrie, and I'm like, you need to meet these guys. And we went downstairs and within five minutes, they had gotten us set up. We ordered our miners, we got everything set up, and we started tagging our vaults with these thermostats, smart thermostats that are able to basically, you don't have to trust us at all. There's actually something that's pinging.
00:34:41.326 - 00:35:23.794, Speaker C: We rfID tag the bottles so it doesn't tell you where they're located, for obvious security reasons, but it tells you that they are pinging off of this sensor. We do audits, we have people that come in to verify that what we're saying is really there. But that product ended up evolving into this distillery product, where it's like, hey, we built this, just this technology to make sure that, you know, that your bottle is sitting in the right temperature conditions. Because even in the wine auction markets right now, that's one of the big issues. If this is sitting in somebody's cellar, their basement, you assume they kept it proper. But did they have a blackout for three days? Did the temperature get really hot in there? Do they even know what's going on in their own vault? And frankly, would they admit it? If all their wine's spoiled? Would they admit that? No, because it's Schrodinger's bottle of wine. You don't know it's bad until you open it.
00:35:23.794 - 00:35:48.434, Speaker C: But for us, we're like, ok, we need to create that same level of trust, or rather, trustlessness, that is able to enable that kind of cross border trading. And so by finding helium and having, again, this blockchain based component that can measure things like temperature, humidity, rainfall conditions, we're able to put that verification and return that back to the hands of the users. Like, do you trust the sensors? Because the sensors are really what's reporting it. It's not coming from us.
00:35:49.334 - 00:36:17.844, Speaker A: Awesome. Let's go quickly down the line. Kind of touching on everything that we've talked about here today. We have an audience of builders. I would love to hear from you guys, what infrastructure, what other products are you guys looking for that can better enable you to build what you're building? What are missing components right now that you would love for the ecosystem. To facilitate you guys in moving forward. I'll start with you, Max.
00:36:20.144 - 00:36:46.662, Speaker B: I think for us a very important one is EVX on chain. So you now have USDC genius, for instance, settlement. But if we have to go to real, we still have to do fiat things with exchanges, et cetera. And we also like our asset side is denominatorials liability site in dollars. So if we can have one first start. But I'll talk to pit later today. Like the FX feed for real in USD on chain.
00:36:46.718 - 00:36:47.222, Speaker C: Perfect.
00:36:47.318 - 00:36:52.806, Speaker B: But then also the liquidity to do the actual transactions, that would be fantastic for us.
00:36:52.830 - 00:37:40.424, Speaker C: I think it's really the web 2.5 infrastructure. So we work with coin flow for credit card payments, magic for logging in with your email because I'm pretty sure we are the largest platform that has a crypto backend that has 70 and 80 year olds logging in every day to use it, because they understand bourbon, they understand whiskey, they understand wine, they know how to use an email, they know how to pay with a credit card. But the second you start telling them, oh, download this wallet and remember these 24 words. And by the way, if you lose them, you lose all of your money, they start to get a little bit freaked out. And so having more systems that allow for the normie users, people who are out there in the real world who want utility but don't necessarily want to learn an entirely new technological stack and infrastructure, that's what helps them kind of benefit from all of these things from blockchain. So stable coins and really all of those types of integrations for real world users.
00:37:40.764 - 00:38:14.904, Speaker D: Jeffrey yeah, I think so. Real estate's priced in local currencies and it's actually kind of tricky to create synthetic markets in USD. So more, I know someone's working on euro e on Solana, but more currencies in a stable coin type format would be really helpful to allow various exchanges in local currency. And it opens the door to a lot more markets across the world.
00:38:15.924 - 00:38:36.544, Speaker E: Yeah, similar to Todd, we've bonded over this, but all of the infrastructure structure that helps make blockchain products look and feel like fintech products. So NPC wallets on and off ramps, like Auth with wallets, all those things are relatively undifferentiated across, like, all of our platforms, but still a hard job to do.
00:38:37.604 - 00:38:57.712, Speaker F: Yeah. Investing into real world asset protocols. I think what we need to solve is the back end because the backend is still on the traditional rails. So all the legal stuff and everything. So you have front end basically on blockchain and backend you have on the treadfire else. And I think this brings a lot of inefficiencies. In the end, the products are less transparent, more expensive.
00:38:57.712 - 00:39:09.044, Speaker F: So there is even more pressure on the founders to have, to have really good products like Credx. So it would actually attract investors. So I think if we would solve the back end also, not only the front end, I think that would be very useful.
00:39:10.104 - 00:39:25.254, Speaker G: I think for us, there'd probably be some level of KYC and AML checks. I think most people probably use Persona. There's some big players in the space. There's a more web3 native product that you don't have to re authenticate yourself for. Every other platform would be a great experience.
00:39:26.394 - 00:39:33.394, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, that is all the time that we have for today. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. Let's give a round of applause for our panelists here.
