00:00:02.000 - 00:00:07.790, Speaker A: Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for being here. Pateo de Galet, the laboratory. Day three breakpoint.
00:00:07.862 - 00:00:08.754, Speaker B: Day three.
00:00:09.054 - 00:00:10.754, Speaker A: Who's pumped? Yeah.
00:00:12.534 - 00:00:14.942, Speaker B: You'Re here. It's early. We appreciate you.
00:00:14.998 - 00:00:45.720, Speaker A: Thank you for being here. We have an awesome, awesome program for today. I was so thrilled yesterday to see this place absolutely packed for jump and fire dancers and all the great content, and we just roll on into today. It's going to be wonderful if this is your first time at this venue. Pateo deglai. This is the laboratory, the place for technical deep dives, workshops, and other great technical conversations. You have plenty of space for your laptops and for working.
00:00:45.720 - 00:01:17.544, Speaker A: This is also the only venue where, if it's a little too echoey and you're having trouble hearing, we have noise canceling, sort of silent disco headsets. I see some already here in the front. You grab them, you put them on, cancels out all the noise. And you could just hear our microphones without any of the echo or reverb. So take advantage of that if you're having trouble hearing what's happening up on stage. As always here at Pateo, we have restrooms this way, refreshments behind me and around the venue. Lunch will be served.
00:01:17.544 - 00:02:16.354, Speaker A: Breakfast is already out, so please get yourself some food and drink so you stay hydrated and well fed for all of our content today. We have a wonderful slate of events here today, but also there are three other venues, as you hopefully know, where content is happening all day. And if you'd like to take a little bit of time and explore the other venues, there are shuttles running on loops throughout the day. It is Monday here in Lisbon, so the traffic is a little heavier. We're expecting a little bit of rain in the afternoon, so if you're trying to get to another venue, make sure you leave plenty of time to get to that venue. But the shuttles will continue to run no matter what, no matter how bad the rain is and no matter how bad the traffic is. The day will end at around 650 at the forum, which is convento do Beato and Rajanatolli will sort of summarize breakpoint, have sort of a closing session and then a closing ceremony and celebration this evening.
00:02:16.354 - 00:02:57.494, Speaker A: You've probably seen it on the slides, an incredible slate of DJ's. If you were here last year, the closing ceremony was absolutely insane. I expect more of the same this year, so please be sure to join us if you're not leaving town. Our first talk today is from my friend Chris at Dialect. I'm super, super happy that they're coming up on stage this morning. Dialect is going to talk about smart messaging and notifications. I work closely with them because I work at Solana Labs on the payments team and notifications and messaging is key and core functionality that many of the wallets in the Solana ecosystem are starting to integrate so that everybody knows sort of what's happening in real time.
00:02:57.494 - 00:03:04.174, Speaker A: But Chris is going to talk about use cases well beyond just notifications. So please join me in welcoming Chris from dialect.
