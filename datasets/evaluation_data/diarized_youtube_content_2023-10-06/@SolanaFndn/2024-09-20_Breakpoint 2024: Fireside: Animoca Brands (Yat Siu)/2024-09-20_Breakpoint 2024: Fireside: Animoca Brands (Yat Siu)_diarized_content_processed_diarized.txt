00:00:04.760 - 00:00:17.681, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. All right, good to see everyone. I'm Jason, I'm here with Yat. Yat, you want to give a really brief introduction? We've got 15 minutes.
00:00:17.753 - 00:00:28.935, Speaker B: Sure. My name is Yad. I'm chairman, co founder of Animoca Brands. We're known as an investor in the space, but we're actually a builder operator known for gaming. But actually we do everything and today we have over 540 portfolio companies.
00:00:29.355 - 00:00:48.939, Speaker A: All right. And I'm Chief innovation officer at OkX. We're an exchange, we're a wallet. We do a lot of stuff to support the ecosystem today here. Yeah, we're going to talk a little bit about the institutional layer and how that affects tokens. What is the meaning of tokens, where we are at today? And hopefully we can help some of the token projects here take something back.
00:00:48.987 - 00:00:57.505, Speaker B: And I mean, so, I mean, I guess this is a crypto conference, but maybe I'll just add to a survey. So how many of you here are actually planning to launch a token or.
00:00:57.545 - 00:00:58.585, Speaker A: Have launched a token?
00:00:58.705 - 00:01:25.015, Speaker B: Raise your hand. Yeah, okay, interesting. It's kind of like left hand versus right side. But anyway, it doesn't matter anyway, it's a lot of you, maybe sort of 40% of the room. And actually I think this is basically, you know, when you launch a token, a lot of people think about it as a way of fundraising and all that kind of stuff. But actually, fundamentally our belief on tokens is that they are represented representations of network effects. So you can raise money on them if you want, but know that when you do so, you're actually selling a piece of your network.
00:01:25.015 - 00:02:06.519, Speaker B: And when we describe it as a way from network effects, which is, we think, the most valuable thing, it's like when you, for instance, join the Ethereum network or the Solana network. Sorry, I'm in the wrong conference. In the Solana ecosystem, owning the tokens actually give you access to the network and the opportunities in the Solana ecosystem. And you're not actually in that ecosystem because you're expecting the foundation to build everything for you. You're actually here because you've got exchanges like OKX participating or you've got Builders, or you've got Star Atlas, or you've got all these other companies that are actually doing some stuff in the space. So actually the network effects inherent is why you join the ecosystem. The stronger the network effects are, the more valuable the ecosystem becomes.
00:02:06.519 - 00:02:42.747, Speaker B: It's not the yield that you make from it, it's the network benefits that come from it. And so When. But what's happened, of course, is that these are representations of networks. Networks can be small as well. They don't all have to be big. So we're a believer that there's going to be many, many, many networks. And I think this year, with, you know, pumpkin fun and a bunch of other ones, we've basically seen the advent of millions and millions of new tokens being launched, which on one hand you could say, oh my goodness, attention dilution, my project, how it's going to sort of stand out, or the other way to look at it is actually you can stand on more because if you have certain capabilities, you will stand out from essentially the masses.
00:02:42.747 - 00:03:46.961, Speaker B: And my mental model of the meme coins that we see today is actually very much like chat rooms in the early days of the Internet or mobile apps in 2010, 2011, right? You've got first a concentration of a few popular places and then next thing you know, you have all sorts of chat rooms, all sorts of places, and what do they do? They're all about drawing your attention, right? And that's actually what tokens represent when you talk about network effects. They're actually ways in which you can measure the value of your network effect, which is essentially a form of an attention economy. And I think, you know, as we sort of delve deeper into this, the one thing I want to stop here with is that the institutional aspect heralded with Bitcoin ETFs now means that if you want to stand out, then actually you need to be able to demonstrate that your token actually is institutionally interesting. Because an institution won't buy a meme coin, but they will potentially buy your project if they believe in the long term value. Because to me, pricing is actually the app Store. If your project has a reasonable pricing level, that's a discovery in the App Store. We're a mobile game developer.
00:03:46.961 - 00:04:16.111, Speaker B: In the early days, we used to have something called the top grossing charts. And the top grossing charts was actually the way in which people found which apps were popular. Why? Because you saw from that measure the value of things. Apple didn't like that. Because Apple didn't like the fact that the applications that were actually most popular weren't necessarily the ones that they wanted to succeed. Right? So they took away the gross ranking charts, but actually what they did was they removed essentially discovery. But in crypto, the discovery, the initial discovery layer is pricing.
00:04:16.111 - 00:04:43.657, Speaker B: And so if you're a project that does well, you get discovered. Right? And what are the projects that are the narratives are the ones that are in institutional backing. Bitcoin, of course, Ethereum, Solana and Ton. Right. And actually now with moca, we have a similar one in that area because institutions can back it, because they can understand it. And maybe the closing thought is that if you're able to pitch to institutions, that's how you stand out. Institutions are only going to invest in things that they understand and they basically can take a long term view on this one.
00:04:43.657 - 00:04:49.665, Speaker B: So I think that's something that wasn't the case a year ago, but now basically is absolutely important.
00:04:49.825 - 00:05:08.769, Speaker A: And you know, at OkX, we obviously work a lot with institutions globally. We did a survey with the Economist magazine just came out earlier this month. And it turns out that actually you wrote a piece recently too in Cointelegraph that highlighted how few institutions have yet have already come into the market.
00:05:08.817 - 00:05:10.249, Speaker B: It's low single digit percentage.
00:05:10.337 - 00:05:26.421, Speaker A: Exactly. They're all still on the sidelines. Our survey with the economists found that over the next three years, 60% of institutions are going to deploy capital into these markets. And so any advice for these projects as they talk to institutions, how do you get their interest in the first place?
00:05:26.493 - 00:06:01.139, Speaker B: Well, so I think the parallels are very similar to actually the markets at large. Right. But except that with tokens, they're connected into one. So when you think about sort of a startup in the traditional pre token world, pre web3world, you build a startup, you raise money from VCs and then actually what happens is that they develop it up to a point and then maybe you get to a point where company might be able to go public. And so what we now have as a public narrative is actually a token launch and that accelerates much faster. So the entrepreneur that needs to be able to navigate a sort of product company now has to also manage a kind of public company. Right.
00:06:01.139 - 00:06:28.905, Speaker B: And that's not necessarily one skill. So often you have founders who are building the company, then when they go public, someone else comes in and runs this. And basically when you launch a token, actually it happens pretty much sometimes even before the product is even launched. So there are some differences around how to do that. So that means it's not just a roadmap, it's basically whether you are able to project your plan, explain your story. Obviously you have to be doxxed, depending what kind of project you're running. So all these things become relevant.
00:06:28.905 - 00:07:15.815, Speaker B: But I think that's the opportunity because that's how you stand out. So the capability is to stand out because you're able to communicate to them. And by the way, Institutions are not just all over the world, right? And because of Bitcoin ETFs, we now have reason why we think it's an opportunity is also now people are in it, right? You have about 50 or 60 billion dollars in the Bitcoin ETFs. And so the next wave of thinking, okay, great, I've got this sort of macro assets, like buying gold, right? It's like an index to the whole space. But now I kind of want to sort of go into certain other narratives that I might understand better. Whatever project you have, whether it's deep in, whether it's gaming, whether it's entertainment, culture, identity, it doesn't really matter. There are actually investors in the space who actually really understand those business segments.
00:07:15.815 - 00:07:49.049, Speaker B: They are the ones that you can appeal to. Now I would say the other thing also is that there are different flavors of VCs. So at Animoca and I think OkX Web, we have obviously an early stage VC fund as well that's out of our balance sheet. But some groups like ourselves and others also have a liquid fund. So what that means is we actually also support and buy tokens on the market. That's not true for every vc. And I think it's worth discussing a little bit the narratives around where people say, oh, VC backed projects are not good because they basically dump on retail.
00:07:49.049 - 00:08:41.661, Speaker B: But it depends what kind of VC, just to be clear, right? Because some VCs, and it's not because they're negative about it, because their mandate, they're running third party, they're running funds from third parties, it's not their money. So the mandate is essentially after three or five years they have to make a return, right? That's normal. So they are forced to sell the token. It's not that they necessarily want to, but then there's some institutions where they invest on a balance sheet or so they actually invest from their, you know, they can invest in liquid tokens. So that means that when you think about raising capital, depending how much you're raising, right? Whether, which stage you're raising, you have to look at also say, well, do you have the capacity to be a liquid investor? Do you have a team that can do that? Or is your participation in your project going to bring liquid funds into your company as well? Right. So there is this value add. And of course from an attention standpoint, when you are a consumer, you want to also be able to see who has done the homework about the project.
00:08:41.661 - 00:09:12.455, Speaker B: And we always say dyor, right? They do your own research. But the problem is that who, when you have millions of tokens in the space, it gets harder and harder to be able to do that research. And so you'll find more and more that these institutions, as they enter the space, as we do in the traditional markets, they will start posting their research and posting their publications and explaining why they have a thesis, which will become more helpful. That part is still lacking in web3. You only have a few research outlets, but you'll find them doing that more and more. Pantera doing that with TON recently, for instance, and other institutions like that.
00:09:13.365 - 00:09:47.751, Speaker A: Speaking of, just to highlight your point about how many tokens are coming to market these days on our wallet, every week we mark and certify 120,000 new tokens so that you can search it in the search bar and make sure that you're finding the right one and things like that. It's crazy. It's an explosion. I mean, Jupiter over on the other stage made an awesome announcement earlier that will continue to lead to these sort of explosion of tokens. And so what you're saying is really good advice, both for the projects themselves, but also the people that are looking to participate in these networks, Right?
00:09:47.823 - 00:09:48.079, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:48.127 - 00:10:00.543, Speaker A: And I think, well, so how do people actually find who's. Who are the liquid funds that are, you know, and what are, which tokens are they supporting or participating in? Where do we get that information?
00:10:00.599 - 00:10:20.763, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, there's groups like us, but there's many other investors out there. You can just simply ask a question. Hey, great for investing, by the way. Can you help us make introductions to liquid funds? Or do you have a liquid strategy, for instance? Right. This was something. Those were questions we didn't have to ask three years ago. Because remember three years ago when you were talking about gaming, there were really three or four projects to look at.
00:10:20.763 - 00:10:57.255, Speaker B: We look at Metaverse, there were like two. Right. So the concentration actually is only on these few projects. So it was easy, you know, now with millions, just a data point, the Altcoin space, not just Bitcoin and Ethereum and Solana, the Altcoin space actually increased by almost $300 billion from a year ago. But yet it feels like, oh my goodness, if it's gone up so much, why are my tokens from a year ago not actually increasing in value in the same way? And that's because you have this attention, you know, we're at 2,3 million more tokens right now and there's going to be 2, 3 million probably in the next six months. Right. So again, the way to stand out, that seems to.
00:10:57.255 - 00:11:25.835, Speaker B: And I guess the kind of investor you bring in who has institutional capability and relationships is also important. For instance, the institution will say, oh, okay, if this company was involved or this partner is involved, or this VC is involved, then there's a certain level of homework that was done. I'm willing to talk to them and you can look at the partnerships. It's easy. Like who has this VC worked with in terms of funds and what announcements have they made. There's ways to do that. Of course, there's not unlimited capacity.
00:11:25.835 - 00:11:52.963, Speaker B: And by the way, just to be clear, I'm not saying that you must go to a PC because it's only if you want to make a stand on project that ends up being very large, you probably need that support. But you know, that's the other thing I want to sort of comment is that, you know, not every token has to be a billion dollars to be successful. Right. I mean, I think we've gotten a little spoiled in the narratives of previous years where everything is like billion FTB or nothing and. No, no, of course not. Or 100 million market cap is circulating. No, it's okay.
00:11:52.963 - 00:12:34.835, Speaker B: I mean, the world is run by SMEs. They're run by businesses that are very, very successful running good projects that could be worth millions or tens of millions, and that's fine. And maybe they're not necessarily VC investable in the classic sense, but that's okay. Look at everything you experience in the real world, whether this is a restaurant or whether this is a business or an artisan or art whatever, these are great businesses that are making decent money have to necessarily be worth what people used to think they would be. So I think that's part of that. I think the markets previously had kind of spoiled that because also we want to bring more people into space. Maybe another data point, 80% of the US equity market being the best equities market in the world, is institutional.
00:12:34.835 - 00:13:04.475, Speaker B: And that's the reason why it's stable. Many of the markets that are, which I won't name that are very retail driven, are not actually institutional, are very, very volatile. Some relationships. Right? And I think basically what you'll find is as institutions enter the space, you end up finding basically more of a balance. And maybe another counter argument, a lot of people say, well, if institutions come in, aren't they actually going to. Is it against the ethos? Are we going to sort of worry about sort of, you know, becoming more centralized? Because Bitcoin is owned by the ETFs, whatever. Well, let's be clear.
00:13:04.475 - 00:13:33.787, Speaker B: I think the number of Bitcoin that's owned is still less than 7 or 8% in ETFs. Right? That's okay. We're not actually saying that it should go to 80%, but if it goes to roughly parity between consumer, broader market and institution, that actually creates essentially maybe a better balance. Because mass adoption isn't just about bringing users in, it is about bringing the institution in. If it wasn't for the institutional adoption, we wouldn't have the market we have right now.
00:13:33.941 - 00:13:47.903, Speaker A: I mean, also institutions represent people too. Right. I think we often forget that it's collective business interests of a group of people that are behind these institutions. So it's not like it's some alien thing that's coming.
00:13:47.959 - 00:13:48.151, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:48.183 - 00:14:05.425, Speaker A: They're also humans and they also have economic interests. And I think it is part of the maturation of our space. No doubt. We've been talking increasingly with a large number of institutions as they come into the space and they want access. Right. They start with. What we're seeing is sort of this bifurcation of the market.
00:14:05.425 - 00:14:31.569, Speaker A: You've highlighted Bitcoin, ETH, Solana, others where there are Trad 5 products where they can now touch the space. But yet, you know, inevitably they will want to explore down the risk curve. And that inevitably means looking at smaller networks and up and coming token projects. And we're hopeful that we can provide some of that education and that bridge. But also token projects themselves, like you've said, have work to do too.
00:14:31.617 - 00:14:59.787, Speaker B: Right. I think they need to be ready to manage and handhold these institutions. But I think again, when you're a builder, think about the other narratives that are going around. There's a big narrative that's been floating around, sort of basically high FTV type of conversations around that. And it's not to say that there aren't arguments around that. But if you have a fundamental project that is valuable instance, it has nothing to do with the valuation. It has everything to do, whether you have a community and the support for that.
00:14:59.787 - 00:15:25.209, Speaker B: Right. There's plenty of projects that have value as well, that are high, that we've backed as well, that actually when they launch, do very well because it's fundamental support, whether it's institutional or from the consumer level, because it's utility, for instance. I think there is that aspect as well. So it's all relative, of course, but we can't sort of create. I guess what bothers me a little bit is there's broad brushstrokes like, oh, because everything has to be low value. No, of course not. Right.
00:15:25.209 - 00:15:43.577, Speaker B: Because maybe it's not fair as well. If you're a builder in the space, you want to get the fair value for what you're building. That could be high or low. It doesn't matter what the value is. But you need to do what's fair for the project. Because after all your community, who was there building something that's the one you're building, you're not necessarily giving it to someone else. Only the participation is the projects that you bring in.
00:15:43.577 - 00:16:09.829, Speaker B: If you're a game, you want to reward the gamers that built your network effects. They spent the time, they're the ones who should be maybe receiving more value relative to latecomers. We get that. But that's basically how the game needs to be played to build a network. And I go back to the network effect. You have to build valuable network effects and if you don't do that, then you basically create these kind of extractive networks where you can't create sustainable network value. Right.
00:16:09.877 - 00:16:15.105, Speaker A: That sustainability is super important. Thank you, Yat, thanks for your insights.
00:16:15.925 - 00:16:16.285, Speaker B: Thank you.
