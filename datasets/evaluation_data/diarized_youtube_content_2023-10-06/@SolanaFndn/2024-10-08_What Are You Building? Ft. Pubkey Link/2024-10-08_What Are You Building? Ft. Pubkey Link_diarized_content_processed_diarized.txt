00:00:04.600 - 00:00:29.239, Speaker A: Today I'm joined by my favorite bman. So please tell us, what are you building? I'm working on a project called PUBG Link, which is an open source discord verification system. Awesome. So what does it allow me to do? PUBG Link allows you to set up role verification in your Discord server based on the assets you have in your wallet, either fungible tokens or non fungible tokens. And it's open source, so you can extend it yourself. You can self host it if you want. It's MIT licensed, so all yours.
00:00:29.239 - 00:00:32.455, Speaker A: Super cool. So everybody go fork it and try it out. Fork it.
