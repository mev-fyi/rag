00:00:03.920 - 00:00:35.970, Speaker A: Hi, guys, can you hear me? How's it going? My name is Max. I'm the founder of Sniper, formerly Sol Sniper, if you've used it before. But, yeah, it's really good to see everybody here today. And, yeah, we're going to go over the past and the future of nfts through the lens of our journey at Sniper Labs from inception to today. So I'm really excited to be here and thank you for coming. So a little bit about myself. I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2019.
00:00:35.970 - 00:01:21.914, Speaker A: I was a software engineer at Amazon, and I was very, I define it as a crypto adjacent person. So I had a little bit of ethereum, I had a little bit of bitcoin, but I didn't really do too much besides let them kind of sit in my Robinhood and Coinbase account. And it wasn't really until November of 2021 did I really kind of get red pilled into crypto. I was on, like, YouTube, and I got all these, like, crazy YouTube videos about how you can make thousands of dollars a day flipping nfts, how to make thousands of dollars flipping nfts in 15 minutes, how some nine year old made half a million dollars flipping nfts. And I was like, what is this? This is so crazy. I really want to try it out for myself. It was this super fast growing segment of crypto.
00:01:21.914 - 00:01:40.794, Speaker A: And basically I went on Openseas. I tried to make some transactions. I realized, oh, wow, this is $100 per transaction. This doesn't really make any sense. I'm a brokey. I can't afford that. Let me go look at what other kind of alternatives are there because I do really want to try nfts out.
00:01:40.794 - 00:02:37.222, Speaker A: And so that's really how I landed in Solana. It was the combination of it having this super vibrant community as well as having really cheap transaction fees so I could actually do stuff. And basically, since kind of joining, I realized that, wow, nfts are really kind of this crazy new asset class where it's this intersection of tech, finance and Internet culture. You can flip jpegs and make ten x in an hour, and you can also put a new profile photo on Twitter and get rated by hundreds of djens that kind of have a little catchphrase like, let's lf something. And then also, at the same time, the longer I had these jpegs, it just started feeling more like a piece of myself. So that famous fox, I rocked that as my profile photo for over a year. I was like, I'm never going to sell this.
00:02:37.222 - 00:03:06.938, Speaker A: This is me I'm the fox. And it just, for me, it became the most fun thing to trade ever. I had dabbled before in stocks, dabbled a little bit in crypto, but this was just, like, a way cooler and more enjoyable experience. And so because it's this brand new asset class, openseason only started in 2017. It didn't really take off until 2020. I joined in 2021. There are a ton of new problems for, like, such an immature space.
00:03:06.938 - 00:03:33.032, Speaker A: So, like, one of the very first things that I noticed was, like, it was really immature when it came to tooling and infrastructure. Like, nobody had any idea what they were doing. We're all flying blind. We're running around in discord. I remember I would buy an NFT and then someone would tell me, oh, it dumped an hour ago. I was like, oh, I did not know that. And you'd literally have to ask people, hey, what was the price? I thought that was kind of dumb.
00:03:33.032 - 00:04:17.980, Speaker A: And then at the same time, what I saw was a ton of scams were, like, minting these projects that were like, hey, we're going to build you this new cool portfolio tracker, floor price tracker. And I was like, wow, that's kind of dumb. And they're making $200,000 off the mint, and then they go silent for literally next week. And so just for myself, a big reason why I started what was Soul sniper at the time was just to prove to myself that, hey, we don't need a 200k mint to literally write JavaScript. That graphs stuff. That's really how it got started. It was originally shipped as sole NFT trade dash Vercel app.
00:04:17.980 - 00:04:38.152, Speaker A: So kind of a mouthful. And really, our core customer has always been the snipers. I always think that's a cool name. And so, yeah, it was like, one morning I was like, all right, fuck it. Let's name it soul sniper. Most recently, we rebranded to Sniper XYZ. And then it was just such a cool time.
00:04:38.152 - 00:05:18.782, Speaker A: So this was now we're getting into 2022. So we've been live since day one. It shipped Christmas of 2021. And then in 2022, we really started getting a lot of great traction during this kind of NFT bull market. A lot of people were adding us on Twitter. One of my favorite comments is actually at the bottom right corner, someone wrote, I spend so much time with soul sniper that my wife gets jealous, and that always touches my heart at a very deep level. And then in terms of, at least for me and my friends starting to work on this little project, it was just a really cool experience.
00:05:18.782 - 00:06:11.234, Speaker A: As a software engineer, all I've ever wanted was to just build something cool with my friends that people actually want to use. And so we really got that. We started basically I did an LA hacker house demo back in like February of 2022. And then I kind of was like, oh wow, it looks like VC's are kind of interested and we were able to raise a little bit of funding. And then the crazier part to me is I somehow convinced all of my other engineering friends at Amazon to quit their jobs and do this weird little thing with me. And then, so like, obviously like something that, you know, we've really taken a lot from Amazon is like the idea of this customer obsession and listening to the community. And so that's really kind of what drives us in terms of like when people asked us for a portfolio tracker, we made a portfolio tracker.
00:06:11.234 - 00:06:51.234, Speaker A: When people asked us for an iOS app, we made an iOS app. When people wanted to buy and sell directly in the app, we added that too. And we became the best aggregator. And so that's really kind of the North Star for us. Ever since the beginning and really through kind of listening to these customer feedback and their experiences, we've really been able to see the NFT space grow into a much more mature in some ways sophisticated and much more efficient market in general. So yeah, a little bit about sniper today, some of our cool stuff. We definitely consider ourselves industry leaders in this NFT trading niche.
00:06:51.234 - 00:07:09.238, Speaker A: We have the best prices, we aggregate the most shit. We have the fastest speed. So our n ten latency for transaction sending and reading is like sub second. So that's only possible on Solana. And then, yeah, most recently with the rebrand. So we dropped the sol in sniper. We're not changing chains.
00:07:09.238 - 00:07:52.436, Speaker A: We just figured that like soul sniper with like the Solana colors was very 2021. And we kind of wanted to do something a little more original. We rebranded to Sniper and we kind of launched our native marketplace as well. And so yeah, this is just like another screen grab of some of these kinds of really innovative features that we're proud of to have started and see propagate throughout the entire market. So when we initially launched the candlestick charts, it was because our users asked us for it and it was kind of like a wacky idea. We had no idea if it would work. But then it's really cool to see because at first people were just clowning it like, oh, like, how can you chart nfts? Like, you're so stupid, ha ha.
00:07:52.436 - 00:08:29.492, Speaker A: But now it's like quite normal to see this get posted. And then like something I didn't know about candlestick charts until like we shipped it and talked to our users is like they were originally made for like japanese fish markets. Like that's where it came from. And it's like, okay, so we have japanese fish, we have stocks in crypto, like why not nfts. Other cool features we have that our users really love that we start to see propagated everywhere. So we have this cool iOS widget. So you can actually just look at the prices of your nfts just on your home screen if you're on the iPhone, the heat map.
00:08:29.492 - 00:09:20.398, Speaker A: So it gives this stock market overview experience for nfts. It's sorted by market cap and volume, the colors or the price changes, and also kind of other cool features that now are very standard for all marketplaces, such as our grid view for traits. Our front end lead, she wanted to make the traits look like a chocolate box. So that's kind of why it looks like that. And then also with Amm pools, we also really like to look at kind of the consumer psychology, what we noticed when Amm pools first launched. So for those who aren't familiar, you can basically shove a bunch of nfts in a pool and they'll automatically trade on a curve for you. One really interesting thing was we saw was like the retail consumers that weren't very financially sophisticated, they were like, oh my God, it's bricking the floors.
00:09:20.398 - 00:09:53.352, Speaker A: And then the hardcore traders and engineers would be like, no, it's not, you're just stupid. If the market's efficient, it'll resolve itself. And so we thought, okay, maybe there's a solution that's somewhere in the middle. And so we created this stacked pool card. And so it's really cool to see like basically this is standard feature for every marketplace now. And so with regards to like our vision for the future. So I think like definitely like way back when it started, like the market was very immature, very inefficient.
00:09:53.352 - 00:10:38.114, Speaker A: There were a lot of scams. I think in the past like year or so, we've seen a lot more financialization and like technical advances in nfts and we're really happy about that. We think that overall kind of to fight against a more efficient market doesn't make sense. But that being said, we've also kind of seen the pendulum swing really hard in the direction of traders and buyers. But at the end of the day, a marketplace is actually all about bringing buyers and sellers together. And so what we've seen is when the pendulum swings a little too hard towards buyers and you have that imbalance, it basically harms the NFT market as a whole. So a really great example is when royalties stopped being a thing.
00:10:38.114 - 00:11:31.676, Speaker A: I think magicine was the firm that turned off royalties for a little bit, and then Metaplex was the firm that introduced the PNFT standard to bring it back. But during that time, it was pretty grim for the NFT market in general. And that was a big reason why that pendulum had swung a little too hard. So now, as a marketplace, a big part of the future that we believe in is actually supporting a lot of these creators. So some of these really great projects that we've worked with include Bodago's heist, Brohalla Primes, Badreavers. We really love working with these creators, and through working with these creators as a new marketplace, we've really been able to identify a lot of problems that we can actually help solve and help create more value for these NFT projects themselves. At the end of the day, we really believe Solana is the best and most innovative chain for NFTs.
00:11:31.676 - 00:12:02.950, Speaker A: We think that in the next bull cycle, 80% of that market will actually be on Solana. Instead, we're really excited in terms of creating new protocols and really pushing the space forward through not only just the buyer side, but also the seller side as well. So that'll do it for me.
