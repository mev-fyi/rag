00:00:00.160 - 00:00:12.734, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Here we are with a special edition video. Today we're going to be talking a little bit about Saga, about SMS. We're talking a little bit about some need to know items. And we have a very special guest here. Why don't you introduce yourself, Andrew?
00:00:12.854 - 00:00:18.262, Speaker B: Yes. Hey, I am Andrew Watson, and I am one of the Android developers on the Solana mobile team.
00:00:18.438 - 00:00:31.314, Speaker A: Awesome. And we're going to be asking Andrew all kinds of questions to kind of fill you guys in on what you need to know about the upcoming sagaphone, which, by the way, dev kits have dropped as of this recording or will be dropping very soon.
00:00:32.044 - 00:00:33.724, Speaker B: Stay tuned, right? Yep.
00:00:33.764 - 00:00:40.716, Speaker A: Stay tuned. But anyway, yeah, so let's start asking some questions. Let's get some need to knows out of the way. Jacob, you got any questions?
00:00:40.900 - 00:00:47.024, Speaker C: Cool. So first off, just, like, basic, for those that don't know, like, what is saga and what makes it special?
00:00:47.364 - 00:01:33.534, Speaker B: Yeah. So the saga itself is a really, really high end Android smartphone that has some special stuff on it, namely the seed vault, which is a hardware implementation of secure seed storage. And so it is fully in this environment called the trusted execution environment. It's protected from the host OS, and so it's an incredibly safe place to store your seed phrase and have it with you on your phone, which is really awesome. And then we've added some additional software to support the seed vault. And so that is what the saga brings to the table.
00:01:33.954 - 00:01:43.306, Speaker C: Okay, so with the seed vault, like, it's separated from the OS, meaning, like, the main OS can't see anything that goes on it can't see, like, your private key and things like that?
00:01:43.330 - 00:02:09.438, Speaker B: Yes, yes. It is completely separate from the host Android OS. In fact, it runs its own little mini version of Android. I'm pretty sure it's a little mini version of Android. And so when you actually do anything that is interacting with the secure portion of the seed vault, it's actually taking over the screen and drawing itself to the screen. And again, the host OS can't see it, you can't screenshot it, you can't do anything. It's really cool.
00:02:09.566 - 00:02:15.398, Speaker A: Oh, fascinating. And was that developed in house? Like, who created that actual seed vault?
00:02:15.526 - 00:02:23.670, Speaker B: That is being done by our partner. Awesome. Nice. Alongside the rest of the, you know, the development of the phone itself and that sort of thing.
00:02:23.822 - 00:02:24.754, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:02:25.174 - 00:02:39.014, Speaker C: Sounds awesome. And then, like, with the developer kits going out, like, as a developer, say, I don't know anything on developing on Saga. Most people don't. It's like, what do I need to know to actually start development on Saga.
00:02:39.174 - 00:03:29.540, Speaker B: Yeah, the nice thing is that the way to develop on Saga is the same way that you would develop on any other Android device. So if you're doing native Android development, you can use Android Studio. If you're doing react native, you can use react native tooling, which I think ends up talking to Android Studio as well. But as far as the development flow, the developer tooling, the way you would do it, it'd be the exact same way as developing on Android in general. And so what I would say for people wanting to kind of get into it, you don't have to go and look at anything saga centric to start. The best place to start would be to figure out, are you developing a native app? Are you developing a react native app? And then start from there and learn how to get that process bootstrapped.
00:03:29.652 - 00:03:37.532, Speaker C: Okay, so say I don't have, like, a saga. Like, I know that there's things like the sea vault, like, how do I develop for it without a saga?
00:03:37.628 - 00:04:51.494, Speaker B: Yes. Well, so the good news is that the seed vault is predominantly meant to be accessed by Solana wallets. And so it is the Solana ecosystem wallets that have opted in and will hopefully continue to opt in to supporting the seed vault on device dapps, react native or native dapps really don't have to worry about talking to seed vault per se for those apps. What you want to be looking at is the mobile wallet adapter, which is a way for your on device dapp to talk to an on device wallet. And so the nice thing is, is that if you can, if your app needs to initiate a transaction, if your app is performing on chain operations, you'll be doing that through the mobile wallet adapter, and then any wallet can pick it up and respond to that transaction and execute it on your behalf. If you want to test your app with the seed vault, then you need to have a crypto Solana wallet on your saga, you can start testing your flows from your app to the wallet, which then interacts on your behalf with. For the seed vault.
00:04:52.314 - 00:05:01.250, Speaker A: Okay, makes sense. And then also, like, for your development purposes, like, if you're building a dapp, and you obviously want it to be a mobile dapp.
00:05:01.362 - 00:05:01.842, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:01.938 - 00:05:09.506, Speaker A: You basically, you're on ramp to the rest of the community through this, like, mobile dev space is going to be the Solana Dapp store.
00:05:09.530 - 00:05:09.754, Speaker B: Correct.
00:05:09.794 - 00:05:12.850, Speaker A: Like, that's how you can put your Dapp on any saga.
00:05:12.962 - 00:05:44.942, Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes, yes. You will be able to publish your Dapp on the Solana mobile Dapp store and that will be, you know, sort of a single point of contact to go and look for on device crypto dapps, which is going to be really, really nice. You can go there and find, you know, we'll have categories and all sorts of stuff for finding apps by, you know, various, various kinds. So that is getting opened up a little bit later. There'll be another announcement for that, but it's coming cool.
00:05:44.998 - 00:05:48.726, Speaker C: And then I've heard a lot of things about, like the Solana mobile stack.
00:05:48.830 - 00:05:49.214, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:49.294 - 00:05:56.358, Speaker C: So, like, how do I, like, what is it, how do I use it to develop for saga and like, mobile dapps?
00:05:56.446 - 00:06:30.834, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. So, yeah, the Solana mobile stack is sort of, we're, we're thinking of it as just all the software that we're putting together to support mobile Dapp development. And so one of those things is the seed vault SDK. But again, that's only really relevant for wallets. There's something with Solanapay for various things that people might want to do there. But the big one in my mind is what I mentioned before is the mobile wallet adapter.
00:06:30.834 - 00:07:25.306, Speaker B: The vast majority of on device dapps are going to be most concerned with mobile wallet adapter. And again, just how when you go to any Solana Dapper website, when you click connect to your wallet, there's a little piece of JavaScript code that I actually think it's actually a big, it's actually pretty complicated. There's a piece of JavaScript code that connects that web dapp to your in browser wallet. That's an adapter that the adapter is what connects the website to your wallet of choice. Similarly, the mobile wallet adapter is what connects your on device dapp to your on device wallet. And so the idea is that, you know, we're not trying to be a wallet with the SMS stack. We want the wallets to do wallet things and we want them to be responsible for signing transactions and managing all that stuff.
00:07:25.306 - 00:08:02.802, Speaker B: It can actually be pretty complicated to, you know, be a wallet and filter out spam and all sorts of stuff like that. So the mobile wallet adapter is a really nice way for app developers to have a way to communicate and do transactions and stuff like that, and then leave the rest up to the wallets. And then again from there, if there is a seed vault present, it can use the seed vault to sign the transactions. But if there is no seed vault, it can do transactions just the way it has been before. All of us have mobile wallets and our seed phrases are stored very securely, just not on a hardware implementation, and it will just work the same.
00:08:02.978 - 00:08:21.410, Speaker A: Interesting. In theory, because you can leverage signing the way that you traditionally would, if that was possible, through different, you know, corporate motives. You could run these kinds of, like, mobile Solana Dapps on any smart device, like any smartphone.
00:08:21.442 - 00:08:21.730, Speaker B: Yes.
00:08:21.802 - 00:08:23.562, Speaker A: You wouldn't need it to be a saga per se.
00:08:23.618 - 00:08:26.218, Speaker B: It does not need to be a saga. Nope. Nope.
00:08:26.306 - 00:08:32.392, Speaker A: Interesting. Maybe we'll see some stuff shake out with that. I know that stuff's actually changing in Europe right now around that, right?
00:08:32.448 - 00:08:58.656, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Well, and so, you know, in my mind, that is one of the most exciting things about the SMS stack is that it actually isn't dependent on saga. It will work on any Android device. And, you know, you could release your crypto dapp on the play store, for example. Like, you could try and see if it gets, doesn't get rejected. You know, who knows, right? But then there's also the.
00:08:58.656 - 00:09:29.914, Speaker B: So the Solana Dappstore is going to be just on the saga, for starters. And so, you know, that'll be nice. But yeah, so, you know, who knows where this ecosystem will go and how these apps will become available? But at least in general, you're not siloing yourself to just developing for the saga if you're developing these react native or native Android apps. Right. They will be runnable on other Android phones. And who knows, maybe even. Maybe even other types of devices too.
00:09:30.854 - 00:09:31.238, Speaker C: Cool.
00:09:31.286 - 00:09:34.924, Speaker A: That's awesome to know, though. I'm glad you mentioned that. Very cool.
00:09:34.964 - 00:09:52.988, Speaker C: I think we have one final question that I'll throw your way is like, say I'm a new developer, I just got my saga in a shipment, I got my DVT unit. We're all good to go. What would you recommend me to do first so that I can start just hitting the ground running and developing on the saga?
00:09:53.156 - 00:10:24.376, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I would say look into react native or native Android development. Google has awesome developer documentation for developing all manner of Android apps. There's a lot of good react native documentation. Probably a lot of people are coming to this with a web app, for example, React native could be compelling there. Then from there, going to our GitHub, Solana mobile. GitHub is just GitHub.com, Solana Dash mobile, Solana Dash mobile, and checking that out.
00:10:24.376 - 00:10:46.442, Speaker B: But then another big thing I would recommend is going to our discord. Joining our discord because we're all there. We want to answer questions. This isn't interacting with a blockchain is sort of a different type of mobile app development. Initiating transactions, these sorts of things. It's a little different. And so you can come on the discord, ask questions where we really want to help, that sort of thing.
00:10:46.442 - 00:10:56.814, Speaker B: So that's discord, GG, solanamobile as well. But everything can be found on our website, which is solanamobile.com dot.
00:10:58.484 - 00:11:11.504, Speaker C: Well, thank you, everyone, for listening on with us today. We're just going through a technology dive with Sauna Mobile. Look forward to getting y'all's developer units and developing on Saga. Thank you.
00:11:12.284 - 00:11:14.924, Speaker A: Thanks, Andrew. Appreciate the time, man. Yeah.
