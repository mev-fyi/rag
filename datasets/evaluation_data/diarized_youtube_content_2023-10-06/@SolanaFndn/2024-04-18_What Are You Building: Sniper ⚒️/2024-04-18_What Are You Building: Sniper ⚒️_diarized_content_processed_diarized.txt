00:00:04.160 - 00:00:04.958, Speaker B: Today I'm joined by Max.
00:00:05.006 - 00:00:05.814, Speaker A: From Sniper.
00:00:05.894 - 00:00:07.350, Speaker B: So please tell us, what are you building?
00:00:07.462 - 00:00:14.990, Speaker A: Sniper is an NFT marketplace and aggregator on Solana, and we're really focused on financializing the future of nfts. Awesome.
00:00:15.022 - 00:00:16.558, Speaker B: So what is your favorite feature?
00:00:16.726 - 00:00:28.614, Speaker A: My favorite feature is the latest one that we built so far. It's adding token extensions for nfts. And what's really cool about it is we're seeing a lot of interesting activities, such as deflationary nfts from the extensions. Awesome.
00:00:28.654 - 00:00:29.502, Speaker B: It's super early.
00:00:29.598 - 00:00:37.938, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely us. It's the motto is if you're not early or late. And so we want to be really fast in terms of adopting, like, new and exciting technology.
00:00:38.066 - 00:00:39.754, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you so much for telling us.
