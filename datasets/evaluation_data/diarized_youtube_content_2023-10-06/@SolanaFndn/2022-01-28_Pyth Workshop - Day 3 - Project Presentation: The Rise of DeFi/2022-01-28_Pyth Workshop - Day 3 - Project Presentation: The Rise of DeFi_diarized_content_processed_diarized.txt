00:00:05.720 - 00:00:14.406, Speaker A: This is the rise of defi panel. So a lot of the people you've heard from today, we're going to start with a brief round of introductions.
00:00:14.590 - 00:00:15.342, Speaker B: Kevin.
00:00:15.478 - 00:00:41.640, Speaker C: Hey. So just real briefly. Yeah. Like I said in my talk, I studied electrical and computer engineering, worked in software for a short while. That's probably what made crypto so interesting. When I stumbled into it was that intersection of game theory, economics and computer science, and worked as an engineer. Crypto was kind of my intro to finance, to be honest.
00:00:41.640 - 00:00:51.604, Speaker C: So that's where I started branching out and learning about a bunch of tradfi topics was from getting into crypto, actually kind of reversed, but yeah. So thanks.
00:00:52.044 - 00:01:24.694, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm Daffy from the Mangodao. Yeah. My background, I was sort of crypto my whole career. Just before building protocols on manga or building on Solana, I was a market maker, trading on centralized crypto, centralized exchanges and. Yeah. And then after seeing salon, I was hooked. And since then, I've been building.
00:01:27.714 - 00:01:28.002, Speaker B: The.
00:01:28.018 - 00:01:32.574, Speaker D: Mango protocol and helping with the Mangodao and all that stuff.
00:01:33.754 - 00:02:01.714, Speaker B: Dan Gunsberg, co founder at Hero Hero Network. Been in derivative space for 27 years now. I got into crypto in 2015 as a chief operating officer, principal at a proprietary trading firm here in Chicago for a number of years prior. Yeah, and just been building hero since 2018.
00:02:03.734 - 00:02:11.373, Speaker E: I'm Bernd from Bernd Finance. Prior to this, I was at an injective protocol, decentralized derivatives on cosmos.
00:02:13.033 - 00:02:16.113, Speaker B: Cool, awesome.
00:02:16.233 - 00:02:31.773, Speaker A: So very diverse panel. A lot of tradfi experience building DeFi products. So as DeFi starts to enter the mainstream, how do you guys explain Defi or describe Defi to your non native peers?
00:02:34.593 - 00:03:04.894, Speaker E: I think for me, a lot of it is just the idea of access. I think it's the easiest way to get to people, is just kind of pointing at what happened with AMC or GameStop. Right. I think you're having this rush of populism and this ability of understanding where people know that they're not sitting at the table with the big boys. Sometimes I give, like, the example if you ever saw the big short where the guys are sitting in the JPM lobby and they don't have enough money for an ISDA and that kind of feeling on the global level, not your defi cells.
00:03:06.474 - 00:03:47.314, Speaker B: I always thought, or I guess the way I've explained it to people is just simply, it's a way to open access and a way to manage your own personal assets or whatever it is that is sitting on chain and removing any intermediaries that could potentially utilize your information, steal from you do any of the sort. And just, I think that's probably the way that somebody who's newer to the industry.
00:03:48.134 - 00:04:46.458, Speaker D: So, I mean, for me, it's, I would say, well, before Solana, I think I would just go around saying, like, it's all fake. There's bitcoin, and it's money that's not under the control of a state. And this is, like, interesting to sort of my friends, but not really interesting to my mom, so I just don't talk to her about this. And then after Solana, I would go, again, this two tiered approach with, like, my friends, I would say, look, this is like what the Internet used to feel like, and you're just flying around. Even in the previous demo where I was looking at random people's accounts and then going on this link chase of, oh, this guy traded with this guy, and that guy traded with that guy. And looking at their. And that's how I felt.
00:04:46.458 - 00:05:37.744, Speaker D: The Internet used to be where you just wildly exploring your interests. And so that's how I explain it to my friends. And they basically agree. And also there's the financial component, which they agree with. But I would say, again, I think there are multiple tiers to this where there's your tech bro friends who will get it and who are on board already, and then there's, again, like, if I try to explain this to my mom, I don't even think we're, I don't think we're there yet. And so I feel like that's one of our goals, at least. My personal goal is to build up mango markets so I could very cleanly, clearly explain it to crypto non native people that are really far down.
00:05:37.744 - 00:05:39.584, Speaker D: Far down the pipeline.
00:05:41.064 - 00:06:16.646, Speaker C: Yeah, it's kind of an ungating of some certain financial services that were previously difficult to access for retail is what I always think of. And that doesn't mean that it's easy to make money. Right. It's difficult, and you have to learn a lot to get into it. But, for example, providing liquidity, amms have kind of enabled people to do what market makers were doing before. And as well, taking out loans on your assets was something that just was pretty gated. And so it's kind of cool that that's open, and if you want to put in the work to understand it, you can do that.
00:06:16.646 - 00:06:45.754, Speaker C: And the only other thing that this makes me think of is my boss sent me a podcast a few days ago. It was with David Mercer from Elmax Group, and he was talking about how a more open platform with more very diversified types of people is just good for everyone in the end. So I think by extension, you know, the final form of this will be. Will be a good. A good thing in, say, five years. You know, more people will have access.
00:06:46.134 - 00:06:46.990, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:06:47.182 - 00:06:49.514, Speaker A: There's, like, a financial system that's.
00:06:51.374 - 00:06:51.638, Speaker B: You.
00:06:51.646 - 00:07:23.284, Speaker A: Know, kind of takes away those intermediaries. I think pith being a publisher network versus a reporter network, that one of the things that we try to do. You mentioned David Mercer. He's on the board of fifth. So we're all doing it in different ways, but having the same effect on the market. So many people today said the word composability. A lot of people in this space are talking about 2022 as being the year of composability.
00:07:23.284 - 00:07:32.492, Speaker A: What does composability mean and what does it mean for your protocols? You can go first.
00:07:32.548 - 00:08:00.376, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think. I mean, I mean, I think that word has obviously been, like, kind of coined by Kyle Somani, where especially, like, kind of the idea of, like, Lego blocks. And I think that's a really good concept. And just, you know, I definitely don't want to be shouting into an echo chamber, but, you know, Lego blocks is definitely the best description of that. Right. You know, where you're going to see the future being a castle of Lego blocks. And so, you know, I think when you kind of look at the ecosystem, you look at everything, like with serum, right? Everything that metaplex is doing.
00:08:00.376 - 00:08:26.606, Speaker E: And we work very closely with metaplex, including the standard, you know, but then being able to use what we built, you know, with the metaplex standard and everything like that, and kind of entering to this world of defi based off of what we had been provided by Metaplex to create this kind of all encompassing ecosystem and then even NFT perps, right? Being able to then link that out like a Lego block to something like serum. This is how we create this ecosystem and how it becomes amazing, I think.
00:08:26.630 - 00:09:53.324, Speaker B: You have, on the upside of it, you have this amazing, like, the real power of decentralized finance is really, like, at the seams between, you know, the different primitives that would compose to make an exchange. You know, you take hero, you take serum, you take pith, put it together, you have an exchange. And which is incredible, there's. I'll take the kind of other side of the coin for a second because I think in a lot of these talks, like, people always just are kind of up only and everything is. You have this insane level in a world that's supposed to be completely trustless you have this insane level of trust that you have to have, have for the community that is surrounding the developer community that's building the primitive that you're composing with. And it, like, it kind of has this little Google Glass feel to it where you had all, like, I think Kyle Smani, again, Kyle Smani and Solana can't say the two in a different sentence, but the reality is you have this thing where you may spend all of your time and energy and resources into building on top of something, and then what happens if that thing you've built on top of fails, goes away, changes direction? Which brings to me the power of governance. And one kind of angle that I see in the future of Defi.
00:09:53.324 - 00:10:59.924, Speaker B: And you see it right now with, like, I don't know how this isn't specific to the Solana network, but like the curve convex relationship or like the curve wars they call them now. And this idea that really what that is, is like you have this thing where this application had actually accumulated so much vote power in curve that it is able to kind of sway the governance around curve. And it goes much deeper than that. But that's the basis for it. And I think over time, this is where governance kind of comes full circle and becomes a very powerful element, is that the, the primitives that you're connecting to, it's vitally important that you actually are a stakeholder in those primitives and that you get involved in the governance aspect because you need to have a voice in how that primitive evolves, because ultimately you become very dependent on each other. And so I think that's something that, as the whole world of defi evolves, is going to be something very important to pay attention to.
00:11:02.044 - 00:11:41.054, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, that's a good point about, like, composability being. It's something people don't actually talk about very often, is, you know, there's all these other teams building stuff that's on top of mango. And one of the questions that they have and worries, like, very understandably, is like, oh, what if this part of your code changes? What's going to happen? You know, what if there's this liquidation event? Or. And that's. Yeah, and I think we're actually just working through those solutions.
00:11:41.174 - 00:11:42.382, Speaker B: What do you say to them?
00:11:42.558 - 00:12:44.784, Speaker D: Well, I'm like, it won't change. You know, we're like, here's the, here's the. We can't promise. Yeah, we can't promise that it won't change because there's some things like, you know, how mango actually, how the program upgrades actually work is, at least right now is there's a council of seven voters and there's a reason why we did it this way. Like we didn't want to put it all under the Dow control because what if there's a bug? Are we going to do a three day vote to say, like, hey, let's fix this bug and publicizing the bug. So there's like a council of seven people, all public, doxxed, whatever. And so I can't tell those people, I can tell them, here are all the changes that are upcoming, and they can even put in their continuous integration in GitHub and write tests so that we know, okay, if we change this, this will break their thing.
00:12:44.784 - 00:13:20.344, Speaker D: So there's all these checks built in, but I still can't promise it because what if there's a bug in that feature and the choices vote to change it and break their protocol, but save mango or not do it? So, yeah, it's really tough. And it's a good point that you bring up. And there's lots of downsides of composability. One downside is you can't just go change the thing itself whenever you want to. You have to work around the API that they've, they've given.
00:13:20.844 - 00:13:24.024, Speaker A: What does the future of the council of seven look like?
00:13:25.164 - 00:13:54.990, Speaker D: Maybe, what's the genesis of it? Maybe we'll just pack the council, we'll just put more and more people on there until it's everyone. I don't know. So the future, I think. Okay, so ideally we get to a stable place. We get to a stable place where we get rid of the console, we get rid of the upgrade key entirely. And it's purely a protocol. There's no upgrades, and it's done.
00:13:54.990 - 00:14:24.194, Speaker D: I don't think we're close to that. Yeah, I don't think we're close to that, but I can, even if we're close to that, on mango version three, which is just now completing an audit, there's like mango version four, and that will have its own bugs. So it's, yeah, the future looks like probably five years or something. We'll have these as sealed protocols, but.
00:14:24.234 - 00:14:26.026, Speaker B: We'Re all kind of, all this stuff.
00:14:26.050 - 00:14:28.178, Speaker D: Is like fresh, like literally last year.
00:14:28.266 - 00:14:36.794, Speaker A: You know, is it contingent on mango or is it contingent on other things like Solana or the people that, you know, potentially pith?
00:14:36.914 - 00:15:06.104, Speaker D: No, it's contingent on mango. Like, yeah, it's the, yeah, Solana also is changing rapidly. So that's, that's why there's going to be a mango version four, because there's going to be new stuff in Solana. So, yeah, I guess you could say ecosystem wide, we're like, undeveloped to some extent and we will get to a developed stage, in which case we can just throw away these kind of concerns.
00:15:06.184 - 00:15:06.776, Speaker A: Cool.
00:15:06.920 - 00:16:15.198, Speaker C: Yeah, so, yeah, composability can just mean so many different things, right. For jet at the moment, I guess in a small way, liquidating the serum is an example of composability. Another, like, non technical ways with DaO is like one when you crowdsource, like, a protocol like that, eventually you can have so many voices cutting in with ideas that would never have been come up with, and your protocol is composed of them in a non technical way. And, yeah, like, we're not working on this, but something that I look forward to is like, you know, Katana is on Solana, they do structured options products, so you can throw some, some USDC in a vault and make, you know, not risk free, but make pretty good yields from put automated, put selling strategies that the vault runs. I would love to see something where, you know, we could take the tokens that are placeholders for the position of a user in the vault and then allow them to further, you know, take out some USDC with that as collateral and then, you know, you can wind up, wind down whatever you're comfortable with. Don't go too crazy. But it just enables all kinds of different strategies.
00:16:15.198 - 00:16:29.474, Speaker C: And, and the curve wars are a good example. Like you're saying this is. I think it's really interesting because it's, like, debatable whether or not this is good for curve in some ways. I think, and I never hear that discussed in the long run. I think it's still going to be seen, even in a way.
00:16:31.034 - 00:17:32.842, Speaker B: It's such an obvious concept, but it's such a new thing that's really come to, I mean, even things around, like, not only. I mean, curve's obviously the biggest one, and then, like, badger getting involved with curve, but it's going to happen. As any primitive layer, application or protocol evolves, it only makes sense to happen. Right. And it's so interesting how it creates this weird kind of interesting level of competition of, like, my interests versus Daffy's interests. And like, are those aligned? And if they're aligned, then we need to work together to implement the changes that need to be implemented. I think another thing too, like we've been talking about the last week is just like what we've been doing, getting involved with more with serum or like, things like that, that, like, I think are kind of flipping on its head, like some of the more powerful ways where you can get a group of people together and say, look, there's things that we want to do that maybe are going to be for the better, for the common good of everybody.
00:17:32.842 - 00:17:47.094, Speaker B: Let's try to find ways to make that happen and like, kind of cool, like, nobody's getting paid to do it. There's just right incentive alignment because it just makes sense in honor of the longevity of the ecosystem that we're all trying to build together.
00:17:47.194 - 00:17:48.822, Speaker C: Yeah, lots of room for creativity.
00:17:48.918 - 00:17:49.310, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:49.382 - 00:18:56.274, Speaker D: Like one thing about composability, like, I mean, on the, on the plus side of it is you get to start on something without having to worry about all the pieces coming together. So, like, for us starting out, imagine we had to, you know, we would do margin trading. Imagine we had to figure out the order book and provide liquidity on it. And the Oracle, actually, initially we did run our own oracle and that was like the worst part of the Mango V two. That was horrific and I'm glad now we don't worry about it, but instead of doing the thing that we're good at, we also had to, because this ecosystem was undeveloped, we also had to do this thing in a really kind of shoddy way. But now that the ecosystem is more developed, we could have just done the margin trading aspect on top really well. And that's an advantage of composability.
00:18:56.274 - 00:18:58.974, Speaker D: It's just easy for new people. Yeah.
00:19:01.794 - 00:19:02.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:03.114 - 00:19:53.414, Speaker A: Can you draw analogies to web two and how. We saw way more products over time because a lot of the primitives in web two were built out or the pieces that were required to launch apps or applications kind of came about. Right. And that's kind of what we're experiencing here. We're seeing some of these things that enable developers to kind of grow and be able to launch faster and more robust products. So there was this great tweet, I forgot who wrote it, but it basically said kids today can open a wallet before they can, you know, before they get a bank account. So there's nothing stopping like an eleven year old from opening a phantom wallet or playing on Solana or doing any of these things.
00:19:54.354 - 00:19:55.274, Speaker E: What do you, how do you guys.
00:19:55.314 - 00:20:11.574, Speaker A: See the future of personal finance? How do you see like some of these users, these very young crypto users that are doing pretty advanced stuff on some of your protocols? Potentially, maybe not, but what are your views on the future of finance?
00:20:12.114 - 00:20:39.330, Speaker E: I mean, for me, the reason I opened up my first bank account ever was. I was playing Call of Duty competitively, and I was getting paid. Other than that, I had no reason to open up a bank account. And I think it's so interesting as you see it today, you have crypto TikTok. Imagine if you would like bank TikTok. That's the most boring thing in the world, me being in that position as a kid. I would have been on axie Infinity, probably, instead of Call of duty, and my mom wouldn't have been yelling at me for wasting my time.
00:20:39.330 - 00:20:57.710, Speaker E: I would have been like, yeah, no, I'm making money. I think this just goes all encompassing of just this new age of access and everything. I think allowing people to monetize off of what they enjoy without them even realizing it is such a key part of the future of defi.
00:20:57.902 - 00:22:37.764, Speaker B: Yeah, that's good. I can say, just from a personal perspective, I have two daughters, and both are below the age required to get a bank account, which is, like, fucking crazy, right? And so just from, like, the domestic aspect, using crypto has, we've been able to quickly start teaching them financial responsibility very early, which is great, great. I think from a more holistic aspect is it's kind of like, I want banks to continue to allow that to happen because it will drive this whole generation to utilizing on chain crypto digital assets. And for us to have real long term positive change, that generation needs to grow up not knowing any different. Like, you want that nine year old, when they're 21, just instinctively using a crypto wallet or whatever, it's going to be in that 13, you know, the 1213 years later and not even thinking twice about using a bank. Because to me, that's like, that's what it's really going to take. Like, those, the people that are the nine year olds now, the kids that are nine year olds, nine nine year olds now, when they're 25, 30, 35, they're the ones that are going to be driving the world when I'm like an old guy sitting in my retirement home, right? And so that'll never happen, by the way.
00:22:37.764 - 00:23:08.996, Speaker B: I'm eternally young. But the idea being that having that just ingrained in them, like, my kids now, like, don't. I mean, the kids now have no idea, like, of what a world looked like pre mobile phone, right? So that's like an obvious one. And so the evolution to the metaverse seems obvious. Like, to me, when I look at my kids, I'm like, they're already in the metaverse. Like, they dial into their phones, they're staring at their screens. They don't, they lose all sense of physical awareness around them.
00:23:08.996 - 00:23:59.580, Speaker B: Already. It's pretty crazy. And it's that same idea that is just going to evolve the world and which is so incredible. What we're all doing here is like, we actually don't know it yet, but like, we are laying these foundations that are just going to be naturally evolving into the lives of everybody in ten years, in 15 years, in 20 years, which is the last thing I want to say that, sorry, I'm taking too much time here, because this is one, this is why it's so important not to just look at the price of a fucking token. You have to sit back, you have to understand what's going on in the ecosystem, you have to understand white papers, you have to understand what the long term objectives of the platforms are. And think about that in that context. How can this evolve to the world that you want to see in 1520 years? That's all.
00:23:59.692 - 00:24:00.744, Speaker A: Solid answer.
00:24:01.554 - 00:24:37.148, Speaker D: Uh, it's interesting, I mean, you said, like, kids not having bank accounts, like, I don't know if you've ever been a crypto trader, like enough, like a fully, like a full adult crypto trader and try to open a bank account or have anything to do with crypto in your business, and try to open a bank account. It's not just kids. Like, kids are not allowed. Obviously, anybody involved in crypto is not allowed, and honestly, it's a service because I don't like mango Labs. You know, we don't have a bank account. I hope we will never have a bank account. You know, we have a, we have a USDC wallet.
00:24:37.148 - 00:25:13.584, Speaker D: You can go check what's, you know, what goes. You know, we got funded by the Dow and where it goes, but, like, bank account. So there is some aspect of this where, you know, you can't buying groceries with your Solana wallet. And I really think that we should probably, we should be putting a lot more of our effort to solving that problem of maybe it'll never get there, you know, maybe no one will ever.
00:25:13.624 - 00:25:14.204, Speaker B: Accept.
00:25:16.944 - 00:26:02.694, Speaker D: Native crypto thing, but maybe it could be something like you cut out the bank accounts altogether, you have a FTX us account, which. And then like an FTX pay card and you pay groceries with, you know, you shop with it. And the connection between, you know, FTX us and like, the whole crypto world is extremely easy. And so, you know, you use like, mango as your savings account and FTX us is like your checking account. That would be really cool. That's what I would like to see. And I'm kind of bearish on everybody having a wallet that they custody.
00:26:02.694 - 00:26:27.026, Speaker D: And you have to think, maybe kids can do that. But I also think you have all these people who have. They struggle with Google. Yeah. And, you know, if you lose your keys, like, that's sad. Like, that could happen to me. Some people don't even understand that you lose it.
00:26:27.026 - 00:26:36.466, Speaker D: It's gone. It's really, really gone. So I don't know. I'm not super bullish on everybody, like, self custody, but, yeah.
00:26:36.530 - 00:26:56.120, Speaker B: Unless they. Unless we really start abstracting away these complexities, if you can do that, combine it with, like, this is where there's, like, a emerging of c five and Defi to make. Yeah, there's. That's never gonna be a whole. The whole world. The whole world may be using Defi. They're just not gonna know they're using it.
00:26:56.152 - 00:26:59.232, Speaker C: Like, to me, that would be a huge, huge victory.
00:26:59.368 - 00:27:02.912, Speaker E: And I think it's just, like, the largest catalyst of financial literacy we've seen.
00:27:03.008 - 00:27:04.444, Speaker B: In a very long time.
00:27:05.424 - 00:27:42.698, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's what I was gonna say without, like, arguing that everyone should and will have their own wallet in the store that it's in. It's like, I mean, I know the comparison to the Internet is a bit of a tired one, but the Internet allowed people to go work on their own motorcycle and figure it out from YouTube videos or documents. And, I mean, the Internet allowed me to start learning about these more esoteric financial concepts. And in a way, crypto allows people to not just read, but do some of them with that ungating like I was talking about. And, I mean, younger people are just so, so much more open minded to. To trying new things in general. Right.
00:27:42.698 - 00:28:01.054, Speaker C: I taught English. That's why kids are better English. It's because they're just not afraid to make mistakes, and they get into it. And I've been joking for, like, years that half of my investment thesis for crypto is that there's all these young people getting older who are going to be more willing to accept this technology and give it a spin.
00:28:02.234 - 00:28:09.798, Speaker B: I think that's why it's a long ballgame. You have to keep that arc in mind when you're with whatever you're building.
00:28:09.926 - 00:28:12.686, Speaker C: I mean, it's so true. Just looking around here, too, right?
00:28:12.830 - 00:28:13.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:13.214 - 00:28:15.790, Speaker C: A lot of cool students I met here, like, this week, so.
00:28:15.902 - 00:28:16.674, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:28:17.094 - 00:28:21.234, Speaker A: So how can tradfi start participating in Defi?
00:28:24.494 - 00:28:25.918, Speaker C: They should get their hands dirty, right?
00:28:25.966 - 00:28:55.208, Speaker E: Yeah. Own forks. That's the first place to start no, I mean, I think there's always going to be a place for tradfight, right? Because again, to the point of looking at the arc, right. The arc isn't done for a large percent of the population. And I think just as time goes on and everything matriculates, there's always going to be that market. And with that market, there's always going to be this combination between Tradfi and Defi or C five and DeFi. Whether there's going to be two independent markets, it's going to be the person who wants the appraisal.
00:28:55.208 - 00:29:20.134, Speaker E: There's going to be someone who wants to know that whatever they're buying is secured, whatever that means, even if it's for a peace of mind. But then you have this newer generation that frankly doesn't care. Right. It's either that they don't care or they felt something out of 2008 where they don't trust anything anymore. And I think both markets are going to live in this really nice, harmonious fashion where if one market were to try to tap into the other market too much, you would see kind of a disorder, really.
00:29:25.034 - 00:30:46.620, Speaker B: I think just continuation of what we were just talking about, the abstraction of complexities of what we're doing. Like, I always say this at home, or to like, to my co founder, Rob, like, you don't, you don't go to the bathroom in the copper pipe that's under your house, go to the bathroom in the toilet and like you do some people. Yeah, and, but the point being is that there needs to be something at the application layer and oftentimes to service the majority of the population like that, to abstract away the difficulties, the complexities and to make it easy. But still at that base layer, that's where I think decentralized finance really lives in the long term. You have these tectonic plates, like we talked about, they're all sitting underneath the earth. And then, like, you have land, and things are being built on the land above it, but moving below it are these big open pieces of software that work together to allow the system to live on top. And it's not going to be the responsibility of everybody to need to learn to manage your own keys and the risks that come with it.
00:30:46.620 - 00:31:06.844, Speaker B: It's going to be more along the lines of like, hey, there's going to. There's an option to do that, but there's also an option to do something a little easier where that's how I think traditional finance and e five will end up coexisting like tradfi at the application layer, Defi underneath.
00:31:07.904 - 00:32:13.756, Speaker D: I don't know, maybe, maybe tradfi like slowly loses it's capital and labor, like all the people involved to defy where I don't know the intent behind the question of like how does Tradfi get into DeFi, but how do they get involved? Yeah, I think probably right now it's very hard. Based on what I've talked to, based on the trad five people that I've talked to, really, I think they have to go talk to Brett at FTX. That's really, that's kind of like their only option. And Brett has to succeed. FTX has to succeed in what they're doing because there's a lot of just regulatory uncertainty or there's just some things that just don't mesh well and just like don't make a lot of sense. Like, you know, they need everybody to be KYC'd, stuff like that. It's like a totally different way of thinking in Defi.
00:32:13.756 - 00:33:12.198, Speaker D: So I do see, okay, setting aside maybe FTX us brings them on board in some fashion, or a lot of the people, you were in track five, but you quit or whatever and you went into Defi. I think that's like a common story for a lot of people. Like the institution itself doesn't get involved, but the people bring their skills and they come involved and like money just flows around where I think, like probably five years ago SPF was broke and now he's one of the wealthiest men. And that's actually a common story in crypto. Not to that degree, but like, you know, capital shifts labor and capital has shifted and it will keep shifting.
00:33:12.326 - 00:33:47.634, Speaker B: I think the labor piece for sure. Like you're going to have some kind of turning point where the rest of the world's going to catch up to the fact of the value of like, of providing value to a network, whether it's in some form of labor or whether it's engineering, whether it's providing some other type of resource. I 1000% agree. That's where things are going to move. Like the whole construct of the labor force globally is like, that's one place where the whole ideals of decentralization I think are going to massively win.
00:33:48.934 - 00:34:37.327, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it really is just about getting your hands dirty. And there's so many glaring market inefficiencies where you can make money, especially when you have more capital. Now this is closing a bit as compared to how it was three or four years ago, or even more than that. But I mean, just getting used to how block explorers present data. For example, working with the data from a blockchain stack, it's an adjustment, but it's not so radically different. It's just a different form of technological infrastructure. As much as you can with regulation, I guarantee you your accounting department will hate you less than my CPA hates me for messing around with this stuff, you know? So, like, I think spending time on Twitter is also, like, a good way to start, like, kind of prepping yourself to it.
00:34:37.495 - 00:34:37.919, Speaker B: Crypto.
00:34:37.951 - 00:34:58.780, Speaker C: Twitter has really taken well. I resisted joining it for years, until a couple years back, but, like, it's indisputably the best place for, like, in the moment data. Seeing all these. These figures in the space talking, and some even trad five participation in those talks occasionally. It's a shame I resisted Twitter for so long, because it's a sweet way to get involved in the space.
00:34:58.932 - 00:35:01.204, Speaker B: Very powerful sentiment engine also.
00:35:01.324 - 00:35:03.304, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For that, too. Everything.
00:35:04.364 - 00:35:04.908, Speaker B: All right, guys?
00:35:04.956 - 00:35:10.144, Speaker A: Thanks. We can take questions if anyone has any questions.
00:35:10.524 - 00:35:11.744, Speaker B: We were that exciting.
00:35:12.404 - 00:35:14.316, Speaker A: All right, well, we're all very comprehensive.
00:35:14.420 - 00:35:15.444, Speaker B: Yeah, good job.
