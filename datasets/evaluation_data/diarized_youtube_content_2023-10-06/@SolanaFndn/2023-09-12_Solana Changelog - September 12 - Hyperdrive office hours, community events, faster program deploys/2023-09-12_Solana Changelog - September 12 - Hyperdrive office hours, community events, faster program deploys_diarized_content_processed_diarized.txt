00:00:00.440 - 00:00:40.304, Speaker A: Hey, this is John with the Solana Foundation Devrel team, along with Jonas for this week's Changelog. To start off, we now have a community events page where folks in the community can submit events that are posted here where everyone can join. We also have a hyperdrive hackathon office hours throughout the few weeks that the hackathon is running, so feel free to join those, and the Devrel team will be in the Discord channels to help you out. Next we have this Rust and Solana advanced development course created by ideasoft. So feel free to check out this course to get started learning how to build on Solana and let us know how you like it, what other resources we got. Jonas.
00:00:40.684 - 00:01:10.624, Speaker B: Yeah, nice. I can't wait for all the workshops and office hours. It's always nice to see what you guys building. And yeah, we are very happy to help with everything, of course. And yeah, we just wanted to give a little shout out to Solandi, who's like, always doing great content. And the last videos were all very good, like about security, account ownership, about compute. And now today, the memo program, which I haven't seen yet, but it's always good to know how memos work if you want to add extra information to your transactions.
00:01:10.624 - 00:01:30.090, Speaker B: Another thing that we found is very nice, John Wong, we found it on Twitter. He wrote an article about how to jump into Solana when you're coming from EVM. And yeah, the article is really nice. It also has like a mister bean reference in it, counting cheap in a little video. So it's also entertaining.
00:01:30.202 - 00:01:32.014, Speaker A: What other commits we got, Jonas?
00:01:32.474 - 00:02:08.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I found a couple of very interesting commits. One I'm very happy about is TPU clients speed up performance by awaiting all feeders at once. So there was a problem recently that was the 116 version. It was very difficult to deploy your programs because the block has expired and you had to retry. And after five times, some people were not even able to deploy programs. So this now fixed. So there's this one commit by Jean Cinque, and then there's another one, which is also speedup, send and confirm and parallel, which will also further decrease the time that it takes to deploy your programs.
00:02:08.222 - 00:02:45.254, Speaker B: So I'm very happy about that one. And then there's another one, which I find very interesting. On the hacker house in Berlin, I met the team from light protocol and they were talking a lot about Poseidon and that they want to do their ZK Poseidon hashes on chain, but it needs too much compute. And I think how I understand it is that this will now be a syscall. So you will be able to do this. And the compute will be measured by the input parameters of the Poseidon hash. And yeah, the compute will be based, calculated on that.
00:02:45.254 - 00:03:17.724, Speaker B: It will be calculated directly on the validators and not directly take the compute that you need for that. So that's how I understand it. And this will help a lot with Z code proofs on chain and all kinds of things that need these hashes. And another one, a little shout out to our friend Joe who was here in Devrel before, and now he is at labs. And yeah, we found a commit from him. Now, the stake accounts of the test validate how it's written to Jason. So whoever likes Joe, he is now improving the protocol with his commits.
00:03:17.724 - 00:03:36.300, Speaker B: So it's very nice to see. And yeah, I'm very happy for everyone to join the hyperdrive hackathon. It's going to be amazing. And I can't wait to see all your programs. And then at some point we will also see each other all at breakpoint. So see you guys next week. Thank you everybody.
00:03:36.300 - 00:03:37.076, Speaker B: Bye.
