00:00:00.440 - 00:00:02.406, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other, we're not gonna make it.
00:00:02.510 - 00:00:11.790, Speaker B: Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew. Most of the time I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life. A face full of glass hurts like.
00:00:11.822 - 00:00:12.726, Speaker A: Hell when you're in it.
00:00:12.790 - 00:00:17.038, Speaker B: That's weird. That glass looks half full to me. Eating glass. Eating glass is staring at the abyss.
00:00:17.166 - 00:00:17.954, Speaker A: Glass.
00:00:18.574 - 00:00:20.094, Speaker B: Who gives a shit about glass?
00:00:20.174 - 00:00:21.434, Speaker A: Who the fuck is this?
00:00:22.774 - 00:00:54.406, Speaker B: It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass. Gotta get some safety goggles next time. Hey everybody, and welcome to Chewing glass, the show where we talk to developers building in the Solana ecosystem. Today we have with us stranger, former developer at Metaplex and currently working at Genesis Go, which is a web3 infrastructure and cloud storage provider. How's it going?
00:00:54.550 - 00:00:56.110, Speaker A: I'm doing good, how are you?
00:00:56.262 - 00:01:20.874, Speaker B: Not too bad. So the way we usually start this show out, just to get to know a little bit about you and how you ended up where you are today, is we're going to ask how did you like, what's your sort of journey in general? So, like, how did you get started in software? Because I've seen you around on Twitter and it's probably been about a year and a half now, so just curious to know like how you even got into software in the first place. What was that like for you?
00:01:21.294 - 00:02:11.198, Speaker A: To be honest, I'm kind of like a late bloomer. I didn't get my first engineering job till I was 27. I was a spanish teacher and I started on my lunch breaks doing free code camp and learning JavaScript. And then I moved to New York City and I was interested in doing a boot camp up there, taught myself some ruby, got accepted, and unfortunately that didn't work out at the time. I ended up pursuing the boot camp route ultimately when I lived in Columbus, Ohio, did a Java boot camp, did exceptionally well there, and I found my first engineering job here in Jacksonville, Florida right after graduation. The boot camp was about three months long. Took me about a month after graduation to get that role there.
00:02:11.198 - 00:02:43.628, Speaker A: I transitioned from a Java developer to full stack JavaScript, engineer node and react, and that company was called availity. They're based here in Jacksonville. That's kind of what brought me down here. And then I started in grad school about 2020, fall 2020, and that's when I got more interested in like cloud services and beyond basic web two programming, and that's kind of everything leading up to my time in web3.
00:02:43.756 - 00:02:52.878, Speaker B: Oh, wow, man, that's a short stint just to get here. So you took the bootcamp. So your software experience in general for learning is like boot camp model, right?
00:02:53.036 - 00:02:55.194, Speaker A: Yep. Extremely hands on.
00:02:55.354 - 00:03:25.582, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I wish I would have actually had the opportunity whenever I'm a pretty much of a, I'm a pretty much a crypto boomer at this point. I had to go for four years to learn how to basically do code and like, I wish those, they did really exist whenever I started, so that's pretty sweet. And you, so you started, I actually started out with Java as well. Did you, when you got into the full stack stuff, were you have a, did you have a favorite whether you were into the Java side or like the JavaScript sort of client side stuff?
00:03:25.758 - 00:03:32.094, Speaker A: Ironically, I hated JavaScript. My company was using like angular one.
00:03:32.214 - 00:03:34.714, Speaker B: Oh, I used angular one, I know about it.
00:03:35.694 - 00:03:59.126, Speaker A: And I was like, okay, I hate this, this is awful. And then once I kind of switch over to like react, teaching myself on my own, I grew to love JavaScript and hate Java. And then the rest of my time at my previous company availability, I was a JavaScript engineer. It grew on me slowly, painfully.
00:03:59.190 - 00:04:21.273, Speaker B: But I think you're going to have a lot of people watching this show that have that same general sentiment, although some of them probably still hate it. So beyond that, after you started working in software, what actually brought you into crypto in the first place, or like when, and like what got you into crypto?
00:04:22.013 - 00:04:41.765, Speaker A: Actually in college, like 2011, my buddy in college, you know, was talking about bitcoin, early investor in bitcoin. So I've known, yeah, I've known about crypto for a long time. I never really had enough extra funds to really go all in.
00:04:41.909 - 00:04:44.381, Speaker B: Did you understand it? Did you know what it meant at the time?
00:04:44.437 - 00:04:58.712, Speaker A: No, no. It all seemed very like I might go to jail. So, you know, I was like, I kind of want to like have this, but like I don't really know like what's gonna happen. I was cheap, it was cheap, it.
00:04:58.728 - 00:05:00.288, Speaker B: Was cheap back then, so I guess.
00:05:00.376 - 00:05:22.684, Speaker A: It was cheap and you know, I could have at that time got in for, you know, pretty cheap and done well for myself now, but it just, it seemed really technically complex and I wasn't quite there yet. I'm sure if I really tried I could figure it out, but I was also very scared of, you know, clicking in the wrong link and like, okay, now something bad is going to happen and the feds are at my door.
00:05:23.264 - 00:05:48.144, Speaker B: The good old days of the Internet. Cool. So you like, you know, you knew about bitcoin like, all the way back in 2011, but, like, still in that. In that same time, whenever you weren't, like, even into the coding side yet, did you, like, continue to invest in crypto throughout those years? Was it, like, gap time? Did you, like, get back into it, like, whenever the bull market of 2017 started or something like that? Pretty much like I did, yes, actually.
00:05:48.724 - 00:06:09.644, Speaker A: So, again, I wasn't, like, you know, super baller in 2017. I was going to my boot camp. But, you know, I did have ETH 2017. I was definitely paying attention. I didn't get very far with it just because I was not in a good career at that point. But, yeah, I kept up with it. You know, I paid attention to it.
00:06:09.644 - 00:06:38.020, Speaker A: It was nothing. It was just kind of, like, from the outside looking in. Like, I wanted to invest, but I couldn't. But, yeah, I remember when ETH, the boom in 2017 happened, I was like, oh, my God, I was texting my friends. I was like, you know, invest now. Like, what is this? And, you know, bitcoin was. I forget the price of bitcoin at that time, but ETH was a little bit in my price range still, so I invested a little bit.
00:06:38.132 - 00:06:39.660, Speaker B: Yeah, it was my first investment, too.
00:06:39.772 - 00:06:49.620, Speaker A: And kind of, like, fell off until, you know, people are gonna shade me for this until the dogecoin, you know, pandemic boom.
00:06:49.732 - 00:06:50.380, Speaker B: Okay.
00:06:50.492 - 00:06:58.944, Speaker A: And that's when I came back and was, like, kind of on the Internet crypto Twitter present. I was like, oh, okay, these people are talking about crypto.
00:07:00.364 - 00:07:17.438, Speaker B: And then that's whenever it started. Cool. So that's. Yeah, that's interesting. So you started to pop around on the. On the Twitter sphere around the time that that dogecoin started to go wild again. That was what? That was like, mid 2021 or something like that, I think so.
00:07:17.486 - 00:07:45.516, Speaker A: It was still, like, stimulus check time, and people were just, like, blowing money, blowing their stimulus checks on crypto, and kind of, I guess maybe that kicked off the bull market. But, you know, at that, I've been on Twitter since my senior in high school, 2009. So discovering that part of Twitter and that I was consistently seeing crypto trends, I was like, okay, I'm getting in the conversation with people, networking with people, learning a little bit more.
00:07:45.660 - 00:07:56.064, Speaker B: Yeah. So you got onto Twitter when people would just write things like walking my dog, going for a run, and then you get on there and be like, yo, buy my monkey jpeg for $100,000.
00:07:56.844 - 00:08:02.244, Speaker A: Yep, exactly. Like, Britney Spears follows me on Twitter. That's how early I was on Twitter.
00:08:02.284 - 00:08:05.624, Speaker B: That's a pretty nice, that's a pretty nice claim to fame.
00:08:06.534 - 00:08:11.950, Speaker A: I'm sure she has no idea, but she does still follow me. I checked the other day.
00:08:12.062 - 00:08:38.664, Speaker B: So dogecoin stimulus checks, you're into it. So what actually ended up leading you when you're still working in software at the time? What actually led you into finding out? Solana, and actually more so along the lines of, this is something that might be interesting for me to sort of explore, like writing code on. Like what? Like, how did that happen for you?
00:08:38.824 - 00:08:47.768, Speaker A: So it actually kind of came from cloud computing. Nader David, he's one of like my biggest inspirations.
00:08:47.896 - 00:08:51.804, Speaker B: Oh, we did a podcast together with him, or it's Twitter spaces. I remember now.
00:08:52.384 - 00:09:31.376, Speaker A: Yeah. So yeah, he was always a huge inspiration. When I was in my cloud computing class and, you know, I was searching aws things, I found him and, you know, I started replying to some of his tweets, especially with AWS amplify. And then all of a sudden at that point I was like, I want to be a cloud infrastructure engineer. I decided I wanted to go from JavaScript engineer to cloud infrastructure. Then all of a sudden he left AWS and he went to, I think, the graph edge node or something. And I was like, oh my God.
00:09:31.376 - 00:10:17.420, Speaker A: And then he started putting out all of these tutorials and content on ETH, of course. But I started taking a look and I was like, this is actually not as hard as I expected. You know, I expected getting in and learning crypto development to be very intense and something way above my skill level. Once I started breaking down, going through these tutorials, I was like, ah, okay, I think I can do this. And then buildspace came out. So once buildspace came out and they had, I think it was like there was two ETH tutorials, there was nothing. Solana at the time I started going through those, and at the time you had to do 48 hours all in a weekend to get the NFT of completion.
00:10:17.420 - 00:10:26.420, Speaker A: So I would spend my weekends pouring over it to finish it. And then Nader David posted a tutorial of Solana in Phantom. And I was like, whoa.
00:10:26.572 - 00:11:05.390, Speaker B: Yeah, he actually, the funny story is like, Nader, I had reached out to him and I was like, yo, would you be interested in doing anything on like, Solana? And he was like, I'm actually already working on something right now. And I was like, hmm, let's talk. So we talked for a while and then he put out that Dap scaffold tutorial and I was like, this was in the days when all we had was our core documentation, and I was like, thank you. Finally, somebody does something that is an easy to follow tutorial just to get people a little taste of how to build on Solana. So it was a super important piece of the early days of this. And, like, we gotta thank Naderdabba for getting that together for us.
00:11:05.532 - 00:11:14.282, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, once he put out that tutorial, I was hooked. I was like, I don't care about ETH anymore. Like, let me learn everything I can about Solana.
00:11:14.458 - 00:11:47.144, Speaker B: Yeah. And then, like, mentioning build space, then, like, like, I got reached out to by Farza, who is the CEO of buildspace, and was like, hey, we want to do something on Solana. And I was like, let's go. And then they put out their first, like, ship a dapple and Solana as well. And, like, that was like a really, that was a time when I wasn't sure how the hell we were going to get enough content. And then, like, all these web3 people, like Nader and buildspace started to produce content and. And help ecosystems get that out there.
00:11:47.144 - 00:12:20.224, Speaker B: So it's really cool to hear that that was your entry because I don't always get to know how people got into it, especially at that sort of, like, onboarding level. So it's awesome. And then, so, like, now that we're on that level, like, walk me through it, because my memory serves me correctly, in the very beginning of me seeing you around was you just constantly asking questions on Twitter about how to do things and rust. And I think this was even, like, before you even really got into anchor. I just remember pretty vividly you being like, how do I do this? How do you do that? And you were getting answers from people on a pretty regular basis.
00:12:20.564 - 00:12:39.476, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's completely right. I just, you know, I didn't care about what people thought about me. If I, you know, didn't know the answer. I kind of put myself out there and the women in NFT discord saying, I could do your NFT drop. And I'd never done an NFT drop for anybody. I did, you know, stuff for myself. Test candy machines.
00:12:39.476 - 00:13:14.154, Speaker A: This is before the build, but this is before buildspace had the candy machine tutorial. The only candy machine docs at the time is, I think Levi Korg wrote some kind of tutorial, and that was, like, the only piece of evidence out there of, like, kind of how to do it. And at that point, it was still, like, really complicated, and there was a lot of things that could go wrong, and it was expensive. But I did get a bite. Somebody was like, hey, I want to launch on Solana. I want you to do my drop. And I was like, okay, here it goes.
00:13:14.154 - 00:13:51.504, Speaker A: I'm going to freelance work for the first time. And it went really well. The project did not do well, but I executed as a freelance provider for the first time. And I was like, okay, all right. And through that, I started getting familiar with Metaplex code, back when everything was mostly JavaScript. Sugar did not exist yet, and I hadn't even learned rust one little bit. But I would take a look at the rust code and be like, oh my God, what is this? Yeah, I was like, one day.
00:13:51.504 - 00:14:30.500, Speaker A: So then eventually I went to the Metaplex party in New York for NFT NYC in 2021, in November, and shortly after, probably December 2021, January 2022. I was talking with them about being a community engineer and about, I was in grad school, I was doing freelance work. I was a community engineer for Metaplex, and I was working my full time web two job still. So I was pretty busy. But I was really kind of hell bent on moving eventually towards a full time role in web3.
00:14:30.572 - 00:14:46.944, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's awesome. So you just kept grinding at it. Like, explain to me whenever you sort of first started to get into rust or even like using Metaplex in general, how bad or good, but probably not was that experience.
00:14:47.484 - 00:15:28.804, Speaker A: So unless you've literally looked at anything that's like, this is how to do this in Rust. Rust code looks super like crazy, especially if you coming from JavaScript. If you're coming from a familiar language, persistence programming probably doesn't look as scary. But for me, I was like, I don't know what I'm doing. What is this? So to look at the metaplex contracts back then, I just kept to the JavaScript side. Whenever I was a community engineer at Metaplex and we started, Sam van DER Waals started writing Sugar Cli. That was kind of my community engineer work, was to help homework on that.
00:15:28.804 - 00:15:59.484, Speaker A: That's the first rust that I ever wrote. I read about five chapters of the rust book and I was like, let's start writing. You know, I probably shouldn't have read more, but I think that I learned best by doing so. You know, I was in there and I was like finding myself able to, you know, write this function, write that function, understand what was going on, get basically the core concepts down. And from then I was like, okay, I'm going to be a rust engineer. That's like what I want to do.
00:16:00.064 - 00:16:41.034, Speaker B: That's awesome. So, like that experience at the time, which is obviously known as chewing or eating glass, just learning the Solana programming model and combining that with also learning rust at the same time was like very painful for most people, but that was also, there was, there was no indexers, there was no real infrastructure outside of RPC services. Flash forward really briefly to today, like how different is that experience because we have so many new things that are being built out there. And your experience, like, as you're writing code today with all these different things, like how much easier is life improved on the developer experience side?
00:16:41.854 - 00:17:12.182, Speaker A: God, like 100 x. I used to feel like I would put something. That's why I ended up asking questions on Twitter a lot because I google and there's no results. But if I was still working at web two right now and I had all of the resources out there and, you know, I could just study in my free time, you know, 05:00 hits, I study web3 and I had all these resources available that they're, that are out there now, I would totally be like way more ten x'ed than I am right now for sure.
00:17:12.238 - 00:17:49.334, Speaker B: Yeah. And probably like a higher likelihood of like conversion of younger developers because I'm sure a lot of people got turned off. Like, you're like, I'm doing this. Not everybody is like sort of has that conviction and probably were like, you know what, I'm going to go to something I'm more familiar with. So it's nice to hear that it's, that it's improved a lot. I think I saw Noah Prince talking about yesterday, like how easy his life has become using like combination of like Helios and Triton and some of these different tools to do deal with NFTs that are just like now I have to do is like almost nothing and I get everything I want. So like, now that we're in that world, it's, it's pretty awesome to hear.
00:17:49.334 - 00:18:13.182, Speaker B: So you were, I guess the next thing is like after that you actually did get an opportunity to join the Metaplex team and we'll talk about that briefly. So how did that even happen? So you were like a community engineer for Metaplex and did you just start being like, yo, give me a job for real? Or did they like, hey, like get over here. How'd that happen?
00:18:13.358 - 00:18:46.984, Speaker A: I think if I recall correctly, the Coo at the time wanted me to join full time and I was like, no, I'm not quite ready yet. Community engineer is what's best for me right now. I was basically the sole JavaScript developer at my web two job. So I did everything, and I was like, I asked basically, can I have a higher role at Dev three? Dev two to Dev three, and they said no. And I was like, okay. So I went to Metaplex, and I was like, I'm ready to go full time.
00:18:47.174 - 00:18:47.612, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:18:47.668 - 00:18:50.476, Speaker A: And they, they were like, sure, okay.
00:18:50.580 - 00:19:27.360, Speaker B: Yeah. Like I said, I'm like, you know me, I spend a lot of time on Twitter, and I actually remember whenever you, like, announced that you were moving over to Metaplex. So it's super exciting for me to just, like, see people that are just hung around, like, getting roles in this ecosystem. Like, that's, like, for me personally, just, like, the coolest thing ever to see people just decide to jump in, grind it out for however long it takes, whether it's six months or two years, and then eventually be like, yo, I can't believe it. I finally got a job here in this space. So you were there for a while, and what did you actually end up working on while you're during your time at Metaplex?
00:19:27.552 - 00:20:21.964, Speaker A: I ended up going to the protocol team, and a lot of my time was spent on the read API. But before that, I was working on various contract fixes and not huge commitments, I think, because I was probably more of a junior rust person, junior salon engineer, I guess. But then by the end, I was working on the read API, which was like, you know, that was probably at the time some of the hardest programming I've done. You know, now I look back and I understand everything a lot more, but that repo was an absolute beast. And I was like, you know, looking at, looking at it just from, like, a whole perspective, it's like, oh, my God, scary on the outside. And then once you get in there and you start understanding the code, I felt a lot better and more confident in my rust skills than ever.
00:20:22.424 - 00:21:16.288, Speaker B: I mean, you hear that a lot, like, diving in. The thing is, a lot of people don't actually just do that. And if more people would, they would probably start to realize it's not as scary once you just dive in, start building, figure it out. The hand holding stuff is great for very inexperienced people, but like you said, it was intimidating. You even thought just web3 in general was intimidating until you go through, like, and just dive into some stuff and you're like, hey, this is like, this is a lot like web two in a lot of different ways. So you ended up leaving metaplex, and then you moved on to working at Genesis go, which, like, you talking earlier about how you were sort of intimidated about technology. Well, Genesis Go is working on some pretty, pretty deep, heavy technical work doing infrastructure and cloud storage on web3 on Solana.
00:21:16.288 - 00:21:26.084, Speaker B: So tell me how that happened and sort of just like whatever you want to about like what you're doing right now and like how that whole experience went.
00:21:26.464 - 00:21:56.524, Speaker A: So I can't say too much about the actual technicality of the work I'm doing right now, but the things that are publicly available. I did the shadowy supercoder v two. I was working on that, still working on that. And now I am working on Dagger. Dagger docs are available. I don't want to say the wrong thing, so I'll just refer you guys to the dagger docs and Frank's tweets from Genesis go.
00:21:57.264 - 00:22:01.324, Speaker B: What's the link for dagger docs? Do you know the URL on your head?
00:22:02.284 - 00:22:23.932, Speaker A: No, I will, I will, I'll link it to you, I'll link it to you to put, to put in the comments. So basically, you know, I got laid off from Metaplex and I did like 35 interviews in two or three weeks. Holy shit. Extreme. Oh yeah. I was like absolutely hustle grinding. I was like, you know, I gotta get, I gotta get it.
00:22:23.932 - 00:22:59.082, Speaker A: Why the gettings good? Basically, you know, first to the market and, you know, not everything matches. And KV. KV, cool. Actually, we collabed on like a fun weekend project. You know, I was practicing building Solana programs and I was like, I, you know, what's something I could do to practice? I just want to be able to, you know, show future employers that I can do this and that, you know, hire me basically. And from that collaboration is how I got the job at Genesis go.
00:22:59.258 - 00:23:39.522, Speaker B: Yeah, this is one of the things when people reach out to me or like, how do you get hired on web3? Or like in talking about resumes and like, you're basically describing exactly the sort of grit that it takes to just literally get what you want. I tell this story very often that whenever I was like in another, I was an engineer for twelve years and then I went into web3 and I was at another organization. And then when I realized I wanted to work at Solana, I just started dming Raj and being like, look what I did, look what I did. Hire me, hire me. And like they did. So people need to realize that. And I had, I mean, it wasn't just they hired me blindly like I had, I had worked on Solana and helped with a migration, so they got it.
00:23:39.522 - 00:24:04.940, Speaker B: But people really who watch this show are new. If you're just discovering this, like go out there and just take what you want because nobody's just going to understand that you're the right person. Your resume goes into a huge stack. Go write some code, go contribute to open source code and go do exactly what you did with KV, which is awesome. I mean, like, by the way, like, I love this guy. He's like incredible. So that's, that's a really awesome story.
00:24:04.940 - 00:24:24.860, Speaker B: It's probably still worth talking. I know you can't talk about whatever you're being very secretive about right now, but like, maybe it's still worth talking to everybody about like Shadow Drive and what it actually is because I don't think everybody listening to that actually knows what Shadow Drive is or like what capabilities that it offers currently to everybody.
00:24:24.972 - 00:25:08.144, Speaker A: From a developer standpoint, it's super cheap. You know, you could store, God, I don't want to say the wrong amount of storage here for probably like a penny. You could probably store a gig or more for a cent. You can encrypt, it's linked to your wallets, it's not linked to, it's kind of almost like Dropbox or Google Drive, but, you know, its permanent story just not going to go anywhere. And a lot of people are choosing to build on Shadow. We have a great stash of community engineers who are building products on top of it. You know, like website hosting on top of Shadow Drive.
00:25:08.144 - 00:25:49.154, Speaker A: You know, I think social media type of apps on top of Shadow Drive. So I think that, you know, this definitely trumps arweave. Sorry. But, but I think that it is a little bit, at one point you had to buy Arweave tokens and that's just a little bit cumbersome for some that's not widely available. I think shadow is way more accessible and I think our community engineers built a UI for it. So even if you're not technical, you could go link your wallet, create your storage space, and just, you know, go crazy.
00:25:49.494 - 00:26:00.534, Speaker B: Similar to just like how Google Drive works. Like, I'm non technical, I can go set up a Google Drive and I can start like actually adding just like permanent storage files on my shadow drive on chain.
00:26:00.654 - 00:26:01.318, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
00:26:01.446 - 00:26:28.074, Speaker B: So now we know your story, we know your journey, kind of do this sort of little rapid fire route. It's not necessarily rapid, but like I want to hear because of your experience, like, we've gone from like, extremely bad developer experience because there was really just nothing available and not a whole lot of tools to learn from. There were no tools, very little content. We are where we are today. But, like, for you personally, what still sucks about Solana?
00:26:28.694 - 00:27:20.366, Speaker A: I still don't think that, you know, if I Google XYZ error, that there's enough content to figure it out. Sometimes I'm still in the dark for a long, beating my head against the wall, chewing glass, essentially, on these random errors, especially anchor to goes for the both of them. And I think, you know, combining that with, you know, I'm not a rust guru yet. A lot of times I'll find myself completely blocked. You know, maybe there's, like, one answer and it doesn't solve it, and I'm like, okay, you know, then you're really, like, in the trenches, and I think that it could slow you down. There are plenty of educational content at this point, but, you know, I think that googling a specific error is sometimes still. It doesn't quite get you where you need to be.
00:27:20.550 - 00:27:44.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is one that we hear a lot, and, like, it's obviously a challenging one. You hear it across other ecosystems as well. But, like, it's, like, not falling on deaf ears. I think it's something a lot of people are thinking about. Like, if you get an error and you don't know what it means, that's a problem, because an error should actually tell you what's actually happening. All right, let me ask you to give me one more thing that sucks on Solana outside of that one.
00:27:44.742 - 00:27:48.638, Speaker A: I don't know. I love Solana. It's hard for me to say.
00:27:48.806 - 00:28:09.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I guess, like, what's. What's challenging? Because I'll just, like, bring something up. Like, there's been talk about. I think I saw something yesterday on, like, on Twitter where people were talking about, like, people don't understand. Like, Solana is so simple. It's like, accounts, it's PDA's, it's this and that. But, like, people don't actually really understand how a PDA can be used.
00:28:09.490 - 00:28:31.134, Speaker B: I've even seen this in the early days. They're like, okay, PDA's. They're like, these things, but, like, what do I do with them? Like, what is the actual. Like, there's a ton of things that you can do with them and how they can be used, but, like, maybe there's things like that that are just, like, not very well understood by most people. Like, did you have trouble figuring out how to use PDA's?
00:28:31.654 - 00:29:06.714, Speaker A: Oh, of course. Yeah. I mean, like, I was, like, I felt like the dumbest person ever. I was like, you know, why can't I get my head around what a PDA is. Like, what do I put in here to make the seeds? Like, what determines what goes in here to make the seed? It's like, oh, whatever you want. You know, not literally whatever you want, but, you know, to make it, I guess, the higher chance of being unique and, you know, maybe that's still the wrong explanation, but yeah, for sure. PDA's was a extremely tough topic for me to wrap my head around for a long time.
00:29:06.714 - 00:29:53.874, Speaker A: And I think that if you jump into Solana without ever reading about the account model and structure, you're going to have a bad time. South park gif insert here. So, you know, take the time and read about it before you think about what you're programming, and it will help you write code. The more you have that knowledge, whenever you're thinking about what to write next or how this interacts with that account storage, that could be, I think, also a little bit confusing for people based off of, you know, dynamic sizing or how much do I need? Or why do I need this much? What's the driving factor for, you know, the cost to size ratio?
00:29:53.954 - 00:30:17.174, Speaker B: So cool. So now that we got that out of the way and talking about all the negative side, so, like, outside of the, like, obvious things that everybody says, like, it's fast, it's cheap, etc. Etc. Like, what do you love about Solana? Sort of on the development side of things like what? What is it for you that makes you love it so much? What's good? What's great about it? What's good about it?
00:30:17.514 - 00:30:32.964, Speaker A: I think, like, once you sit down and learn everything, the programming structure just makes sense. Oh, okay. Everything's an account. Okay, I know that now. And, you know, once you sit down and learn anchor and you read through the anchor docs. Oh, okay. Anchor's cool.
00:30:32.964 - 00:30:59.434, Speaker A: I like anchor now. So it's like you have to give a lot, and then it kind of becomes easy. But it's not just going to come easy. You have to put in the work, take time to learn. Otherwise, you know, I feel like you're kind of flying blind. And I think another thing about Solana development that I love is the engineers love developing on Solana. People love developing on Solana.
00:30:59.434 - 00:31:37.254, Speaker A: I don't ever hear people as bullish on developing ETH. So to me, that was attractive. People were like, okay, yes, let's put out all this cool stuff on Solana. What can we do with it? How can we stretch the bounds of what can be done with Solana? What's the craziest things we can build, like the pokemon game on Solana, I was like, that's cool. How did you think of that? Stuff like that, pushing the boundaries, because you can, you can't do that on ETH. It's just, it doesn't work, in my opinion. Solana, you could do almost anything fast, cheap.
00:31:37.594 - 00:32:11.272, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, that's the thing. And I see a lot of people out there that, like, we see a lot of the same stuff. We see a lot of NFT projects and defi. And don't get me wrong, these are important, like base layer elements of any ecosystem. But it's really important to start thinking about what can Solana do that no other blockchain can do right now? And like, let's do that stuff right now. But you also have to think about, is this a feasible thing that's going to get users as well? Unless you're just building some tooling and stuff. But pushing the bounds of is really going to be important over the next few years.
00:32:11.272 - 00:32:48.004, Speaker B: And I think we have a lot of people around here that are starting to be like, I get it. I think I can do this really wild thing on here, and it's going to work. And hopefully we start to see more of that. So we're going to wrap this up, the questions that I normally ask everybody before we end the show. And just from your own perspective, you have a pretty unique journey from how you started to where you are now and just take all that into consideration and just somebody that's thinking about building on Solana a little bit hesitant or just really not sure, maybe sort of just, just doesn't know if they can do it. Like, what's your advice to that person?
00:32:48.544 - 00:32:51.688, Speaker A: Just do it. Insert Shia LaBeouf gif here.
00:32:51.816 - 00:32:56.284, Speaker B: Hey, Nike's not gonna let us, like, share this episode now.
00:32:58.104 - 00:33:45.168, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, just get in there. Just explore. I mean, you're not employed yet, so it's okay for you to be bad and mess up, connect with people on Twitter. I just started commenting on people's things and that they would follow me, and I was like, you know, maybe I was annoying for some things, especially early metaplex day. I was like, why does this cannon machine stuff not work, you know, all over Twitter? And I was just, like, so frustrated. But, you know, eventually people took notice of me and, you know, I was trying to do things and, you know, there were errors, unexplainable errors, and I was just trying to get information. So don't be afraid to reach out to people, especially people that are writing these, the content and tutorials that you're looking at, they probably would love to talk to you because, you know, they love to educate.
00:33:45.168 - 00:34:14.776, Speaker A: Otherwise, they wouldn't be making content, especially if they find that their content wasn't as clear as maybe they intended. But just don't be afraid. I think that whenever I was doing those tutorials on ETH, I didn't feel as strong of a connection to the ETH community on Twitter, but I kind of felt immediate connection once I got into the Solana side. I felt that people were nice and open and they cared about Solana, and they wanted to see Solana do well.
00:34:14.840 - 00:34:24.360, Speaker B: So you can say it like everybody else does. Came for the text, stayed for the vibes. Every guest pretty much says that in some form or another, and, like, we love to hear it.
00:34:24.432 - 00:34:25.324, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:34:25.624 - 00:34:36.994, Speaker B: But anyways, thanks for joining us, stranger, and this was a really great episode, and I'm glad we finally got to do this, so. All right, see you next time. Cheers.
00:34:37.034 - 00:34:48.874, Speaker A: Thank you for having me close.
