00:00:00.120 - 00:00:22.790, Speaker A: Have you ever wondered why no one ever built a habagger stacks for NFTs on Solana? Well, it wasn't really possible before, but now that we have the permanent delegate extension, what you can do is actually create a super authority for your token which will be allowed to burn and transfer any token out of any token account. And while it sounds very dangerous, there's actual use cases for this. So for example, in some new restrictions there might be a stablecoin issuer which needs to be.
00:00:22.822 - 00:00:23.806, Speaker B: Able to freeze the.
00:00:23.830 - 00:00:44.264, Speaker A: Funds of certain sanctioned entities, for example. And you can build this cool thing like the Hauberk attacks which is basically an NFT which is always on auction. And now you can like take this super authority, transfer it into your program and then whenever someone doesn't pay the tax you just transfer this NFT from the old user to the new user. So now that this is possible, I wonder who's gonna build that.
