00:00:12.440 - 00:00:22.646, Speaker A: Hey, folks, this is Anatoly, and you're listening to the Solano podcast. And today I have Jason with me, who's a general partner at Spartan Capital. Awesome to have you, Toli, good to.
00:00:22.670 - 00:00:23.414, Speaker B: Talk to you again.
00:00:23.534 - 00:00:48.980, Speaker A: Yeah. So I am especially excited to talk to you because you were, like, one of the first people that I talked to in crypto, and that was, I think, three years ago at this point, so feels like nothing has changed. But I'd love to hear your story of how you got into crypto and how you actually got into spartan capital, one of the, I think, the coolest venture capital firms in crypto.
00:00:49.092 - 00:01:28.020, Speaker B: Yeah. Thanks. It's pretty wild, because I remember we were introduced by our mutual friend Bonnie from 500 startups, and it was. She was basically, she shared with me the initial white paper. And I think back then, you guys were kind of going by the tagline the Nasdaq for blockchains. And to be quite honest, in our first conversation when I had you on my podcast, I maybe understood, like, half of what you said, and I really tried to, like, rerecord certain questions so that I could frame it for our listeners. But I think the kind of general understanding for what Solana could really bring didn't really hit me until maybe a while afterwards when I kind of started studying deeper into the blockchain.
00:01:28.020 - 00:02:12.618, Speaker B: And that kind of coincided with how I got into Spartan, basically, I was working full time in New York as a consultant at that time, so nothing to do with blockchains, but I decided to kind of learn more about the space and really interview people like yourself and kind of scam people into coming onto the show so I can force them to give me tutorial lessons for, like, an hour just to kind of teach me what's going on. So I did that for about a year, and then I actually lost my visa at that time, so I had to go back to Hong Kong, and I thought that was a good time to kind of just go full time into crypto. And I just so happened to run into the guys at Smarten when they were spinning up a new fund. So I joined them as a research analyst, and in the subsequent two, three years, I just basically helped them build up the fund, and we've been investing ever since.
00:02:12.706 - 00:03:01.274, Speaker A: That's awesome, man. For folks that don't know the story, 500 startups was, like, where salama started. And it's kind of like. It's like a very dingy office. It is a definition of dingy, I think, in San Francisco, and it's kind of, I think, a good start for startups to have, like, a little bit of discomfort in the beginning, but it was a lot of fun. So I guess I'd love to hear, like, what you guys saw in the two years leading up to, I think, this bull run, because it feels like there's a lot of folks that are probably entering the space right now that don't understand the real pain that everyone went through for a very long time.
00:03:01.574 - 00:03:43.636, Speaker B: Yeah, we started in almost the depths of the bear market in 2018, so it was basically eating glass for, like, two years. And at that time, there was a real concern that crypto might not be around, because we saw the excesses of 2017, and not a lot of things from 2017 actually remained. So when I first got into crypto, as people remember, there were a lot of icos, a lot of random ideas. Defi really wasn't a thing. I think there were a lot of promising layer ones, but then nothing was really happening on them. But fast forward to this cycle. We see almost $100 billion, if you include all the chains in terms of collateral locked in Defi, where you see actual activity happening, not just on Ethereum, but on other chains.
00:03:43.636 - 00:04:33.146, Speaker B: So there's something that's very palpably different about this cycle. But in terms of how we got to this bull run, I think it's just a lot of founders that are building throughout the bear market. Even on Ethereum, where we started deploying into Defi projects like Synthetix and ETH Lend, which now goes by Aave, the founders basically just didn't care that it was a bear market and just kept building. And a lot of them started off as completely different projects. So Synthetix started off as a stablecoin project called Haven, and they pivoted into this derivatives kind of synthetic trading exchange. So I think there are a lot of stories where, as the excesses of 2017 kind of subsided, it left behind a lot of remnants that were then picked up and reassembled into things that actually had users and actually had potential for this cycle. So I think that that's kind of how it started.
00:04:33.330 - 00:04:49.498, Speaker A: How did you guys separate the B's from, like, the Keynes and stanis of the world? Like, because I remember that time, and it was really hard to distinguish, even for, like, founders, like, what was, like, a legitimate team and who wasn't.
00:04:49.586 - 00:05:18.022, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that that's where we have the benefit of starting as a fundamentals fund first. So we actually have two funds. So the first one was a fundamentals hedge fund. So what that means is we look into what the traditional finance folks would call fundamentals. So things like revenue, you know, users, you know, usage numbers or KPI's like that. Whereas for traditional venture firms, they would probably go even earlier in the lifecycle and really just invest in an idea, in a founder. So when we started, we had the benefit of kind of looking at data.
00:05:18.022 - 00:05:51.618, Speaker B: So when we kind of surveyed the space, we realized that the only meaningful revenue that was being generated at that time was in DeFi. So people were actually going out of their way to pay like ridiculous gas to use horrible applications with horrible Ux. So that usually to us, is the sign that people care enough about these applications to tolerate the horrible experience and pay these fees to actually use them. So there's something there. So that's kind of how we decided, okay, DeFi is quite interesting. And it started with maker, which had by far the most usage at that time. And then we kind of started branching out from there.
00:05:51.618 - 00:06:32.358, Speaker B: And then this year we started a venture fund. So I think that really builds on the experience that we had from the hedge fund, which allows us to kind of go earlier in the lifecycle to not really require that much data and really kind of build on that intuition about what founders we want to be working with, what ideas we want to be investing in. But I got to admit, I think that the latter is actually a little bit harder because you need a lot more conviction about where you think the space is going, and you definitely need a much deeper understanding of the space. So I think that the general impression that people have for VC's that, oh, it's just kind of allocating capital, throwing money around and seeing what sticks. That turns out to be very wrong. I think it's actually a bit more challenging than hedge fund side.
00:06:32.446 - 00:06:41.966, Speaker A: I, you know, honestly, I think people quite underestimate how hard it is to give somebody else money on, like a handshake, basically. Like on the other side of the world.
00:06:42.030 - 00:06:43.038, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
00:06:43.086 - 00:07:15.586, Speaker A: Like it's, it's, it's a very hard proposition, and you have to really believe in the team or the person first. And most of all, when you guys were looking at Defi, this was really, I think it was pre maker. What was the intuition around maker that you thought that that might be a real thing, or what was the data that you guys actually saw? Because I think Ethereum daily active user numbers are still, even today, quite low compared to a Silicon Valley, fintech or social network.
00:07:15.690 - 00:07:57.538, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think there were a few things. Number one was kind of just the most naive one, which is kind of TVL, right? So total value locked in the system was growing, and the other thing was the stability fees. So maker was one of the first tokens to have some sort of value accrual mechanism. So rather than just a cryptocurrency, it burns a part of its supply based on interest that's charged from people borrowing money from the maker system. So they call this a stability fee. So as an analyst at that time, there's actually something I can model where I can basically model out the rate of the burns and build this counter cash flow model and figure out, okay, how much this thing might be worth in the future under certain assumptions.
00:07:57.538 - 00:08:33.002, Speaker B: So that was really one of the very few projects where there was some basis for financial analysis. And then over time, we started speaking to the team, and we realized that there are some interesting tidbits of data as well. Like, I think 50% of the users were using the chinese language, the GUI for maker. So that signaled to us that maybe half the users are from China. So there's a pretty global user base and also the use case around maker. I think initially they really wanted to bring their stable coin to emerging markets to bank the unbanked. But as with most things in crypto, the initial batch of users are speculators.
00:08:33.002 - 00:08:49.122, Speaker B: So by enabling kind of trustless leverage, that was a really easy to kind of understand use case for us, and it was clear that it would take off. So we started looking into kind of similar projects that allowed other speculative use cases. So that's where things like Aave Synthetix came in.
00:08:49.178 - 00:08:54.898, Speaker A: You know, like, all those guys didn't start in trading as, like, being their main use case.
00:08:55.026 - 00:08:55.734, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:58.114 - 00:09:02.090, Speaker A: Did anyone foresee that being, like, the thing?
00:09:02.242 - 00:09:03.130, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know.
00:09:03.202 - 00:09:07.866, Speaker A: Besides, of course, us, where we said we're going to build Nasdaq. Yeah.
00:09:07.890 - 00:09:47.960, Speaker B: You guys were like, really clear, like, from day one what you guys want to do. And I. I think in the beginning, everyone was talking about banking the unbanked. Everyone wants to make these stable coins and bring it to emerging markets, but it was clear that it wasn't ready for that. So I think for crypto, it almost always happens in three waves. For Defi, my thesis that I've been toying around is that in the beginning, in the first wave, it's all the speculators, it's all the degens, all the crypto natives that are bootstrapping the liquidity that will be trading and levering up and doing whatever with these crypto apps. And then the next wave, you bring in people who are slightly less crypto native, but kind of digital native.
00:09:47.960 - 00:10:39.000, Speaker B: So these are the artists, the musicians, the designers, and you start to see them come in with the NFT wave, and then the final wave would be bridging it to the wider world, the retails or the emerging markets or the institutions. I think that wave is probably a few years out. I think a lot of projects are trying to build for those users right now in terms of stable coins for emerging markets, in terms of tranche products for institutions. But so far, we haven't seen a lot of adoption there. So I think a lot of projects just kind of gravitate back to the first wave where the users are today. And, yeah, I'm actually curious to hear about whether this was something that surprised you, because obviously serum did a massive part in kind of bootstrapping a lot of the attention for Solana as well, and they're completely focused on trading. And I'm curious if that was an intentional choice or was that something that surprised you?
00:10:39.152 - 00:11:20.144, Speaker A: Well, I mean, as a startup, there's a lot of stuff that's not intentional. You just kind of boil the ocean, so to speak. Like taking every meeting you can, talking to everybody you can, and, like, giving the pitch. Right, like that was intentional, right? Like me not sleeping for two years. But. But the accident was finding Sam and him immediately recognizing, okay, there is something special here, and that his vision kind of really well aligns with this. We can actually build this censorship resistant price discovery engine for the entire globe.
00:11:20.144 - 00:12:15.144, Speaker A: And he was like, okay, I get that. That's a cool thing. Let's go do it. That was, I think, an accident, but there's no accident. You just kind of work at it. If any founder, if any folks that are entrepreneurial, listening to this, all those stupid books where they say it's 99% work, 1% luck, it's all true, you gotta put in the work. When you think about the next wave, do you think the companies that are building this stuff now are the ones that are going to get there? Or do you think, like, you're going to see more mature companies be able to capture that market? There's always this kind of balance between, do I build for current users and work on current product market fit, or do I build for this future thing that doesn't have a clear use case yet?
00:12:15.644 - 00:12:57.138, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a really hard question because we saw how users are really fickle in crypto. There's no kind of brand loyalty or no kind of product loyalty. Even in the DeFi summer wave of August 2020 to October 2020, we saw a lot of new projects doing vampire attacks on each other and stealing each other's liquidity, and there was really zero loyalty. So initially my thought was that a lot of DeFi protocols would resemble prime brokerages. So they would compete for collateral and that's the only thing they would compete on. And they would try to do this by vertically integrating and offering more and more services and trying to be aggregators. And you kind of see this with some projects with like Zero X.
00:12:57.138 - 00:13:45.778, Speaker B: They started off as a pure kind of on chain exchange, and then they launched matcha, which is aggregating other exchanges. And you see this with one inch as well. They started off as an aggregator and then they vertically integrated to their own Amm and they're now doing their kind of like lending product. So you see a lot of projects trying to go this kind of vertical integration route. So I think the logical conclusion for that is a lot of that would start to actually look quite similar, maybe in like one to three years, and they start to compete with each other. So my kind of hypothesis is that a lot of these guys that are focusing only on crypto natives and Degen users will eventually vertically integrate to include those other waves of users. And so far I haven't seen evidence to tell me otherwise, to tell me that there are non dgen focused projects that are bringing in a lot of users.
00:13:45.778 - 00:13:52.318, Speaker B: I think the first signs of that might be in the NFT realm, but that's still very early days. That's probably like three months old still.
00:13:52.446 - 00:14:10.034, Speaker A: But wouldn't the team that cracks the nut on getting 10 million people to use something, wouldn't they just vertically build all the features that people want without ever bothering to go talk to one inch or aave?
00:14:10.374 - 00:14:43.318, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's possible. I'm trying to think if there's any examples of this kind of emerging. I guess Terra is a really interesting example. Right? Because they started with like, just, I remember do wasn't even that, you know, convinced about DeFi when I was kind of first looking at the project. But they built this application that a lot of folks in Korea are using to pay. So this app called Chai, and users didn't even know they're using crypto. They just know that, hey, if I use this to kind of shop online, I can get a rebate.
00:14:43.318 - 00:15:13.018, Speaker B: But then what's interesting to me is they actually went the other way. So they started integrating back into crypto and built all these kind of dgemmed products like mirror for synthetic trading and anchor for lending. So I do think that in the short term, if you want to bootstrap any type of attention or usage and really tap into the liquidity that crypto has created, you kind of need to be a little bit degen. But in terms of the big opportunity, I think it's definitely outside of crypto.
00:15:13.106 - 00:15:59.750, Speaker A: Yeah. And to me, I think a lot of the founders, like Andre Stani, they realize that there's almost no moats, or like, the moats are really hard to keep. And I don't know what it is that keeps them. In a lot of ways I kind of see some of these networks that do have some stickiness, like Uniswap and the major defi blue chips, as people call them, maker. I don't know if it's the social network that's gluing them together or the liquidity or the trust that people built into those protocols. Do you guys imagine as a vc that people don't want to try another stablecoin because maker works and there's just technical risks, there's just too much risk to go try something else?
00:15:59.902 - 00:16:24.862, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a few avenues where moats come from. So integrations is one of them. These are all open source and all projects can plug into each other. But I think there is a critical mass where if you integrate with enough projects and enough wallets, then people just stop bothering to try new things. So Dai was a great example of that. They are in basically every DeFi project. If they want to use the trusted stablecoin, they use Dai.
00:16:24.862 - 00:17:03.132, Speaker B: So they have some sort of a moat there. And the security thing is also huge. I think there is strong Lindy effect at DeFi where there's massive, massive risk to using very new products. So people kind of just gravitate towards things that has been around for a long time. Like, I would be willing to put a lot of my savings into something like compound, but maybe not cream, which is relatively newer until they show more history. So that's another thing. And I think the third and most important thing, and you know this much better than I do, is that I feel like innovation, the speed of innovation, is probably the best mode just how fast you can execute relative to your peers and your competitors.
00:17:03.268 - 00:17:47.250, Speaker A: So there's like this really hard tension right between speed of innovation and the slendy effect of like something like uniswap. You know, like serum had three versions in six months. Uniswap, like serum is a much more complicated thing. It's like a central limit order book, like full style matching risk engine, like the whole shebang. And it took uniswap many years to get to v three. So it's an interesting dilemma. I'm curious if you think that that may even break at some point if new projects can get enough proof security audits.
00:17:47.250 - 00:17:59.284, Speaker A: I don't know if the industry can mature to a point where you can have releases of software that people can trust almost from the bat, and that innovation kind of starts taking over.
00:18:00.024 - 00:18:35.604, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's such a hard problem, right? Because most of the buck bounties, I think like the median size of the buck bounty that I see out there is $100,000. Hackers basically can make, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars by exploiting these protocols. So why would they bother to go with these bug bounties? So I haven't been able to think of a solution to that problem. I don't know if you guys have thought about that as well, but just the fact that the TVL in DeFi, this honey pot, is so massive relative to what any project is able to pay in terms of buck bounties, I think that's going to be a huge incentive problem moving forward.
00:18:35.724 - 00:19:12.334, Speaker A: That has been quite surprising for me. I guess, coming from Qualcomm, I kind of looked at the remastered bug bounties to apple. So I think it might be like 500,000 to the largest one. Like a proof of theft of funds or something like that, which to me is actually seems kind of low because the risks are so high. Right. Apple, it's similar like a trillion dollar company that had a break into their trust zone that totally rooted every device in the world. That would have a lot of damage to their market cap.
00:19:14.594 - 00:19:15.482, Speaker B: Relative to that.
00:19:15.538 - 00:19:47.750, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We live in a world where most of the folks with a skill level to pull that off would actually rather take the bug bounty than like live with this kind of like black mark for the rest of their life. Because, you know, all those people are like educated, they have careers, right? They have. There's like other. Other things for them to do. Yeah, I think crypto in a lot of ways is pretty blessed in terms of like, the folks that are in the space. What did you guys think of Faye?
00:19:47.862 - 00:20:19.594, Speaker B: Yeah, Faye is a really interesting one. I don't think a lot of people read the docs before they quote unquote aped into it. They don't realize that there might be a penalty to withdraw your funds if the stablecoin is under peg, they don't realize that your capital might be locked up. So I think it speaks more to the stage of the market we're in than the FAE project itself that people are just aping into random projects. Well, not random projects, but any project without reading, without fully understanding the risks.
00:20:19.714 - 00:20:25.094, Speaker A: Was there an expectation of them to get that much TVL that quickly?
00:20:26.994 - 00:21:01.682, Speaker B: I don't think they. I would be surprised if they were not surprised by how fast it grew. Okay, but then there's also precedent, right? If you look at things like Ampleforth empty set dollars, these things are designed to basically be a proxy for human reflexivity, right? It's basically, people love trading these algo coins for some reason. So they're known to attract huge amounts of capital in a short period of time. But in terms of how much it actually attracted, I think they're surprised, because I think if you consider a fundraise, it's probably the largest fundraiser of this cycle. It's like a billion dollars or something.
00:21:01.818 - 00:21:26.534, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty insane. I mean, the tvls don't necessarily. It's not like the capital can be used to go build Faye. Right? Like, so it's a little different. But it is an absurd amount of funds moving into a protocol. Is this yield farming mechanic? Do you. I mean, like three months ago, literally, Sam and I were like at a clubhouse talking about how this is the seal.
00:21:26.534 - 00:21:29.114, Speaker A: Farming is not sustainable. And yet here we are.
00:21:32.374 - 00:22:11.050, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think there's, I mean, yield farming itself is an idea. I think it's a great idea because it's basically just a method of distribution that's a little bit more active than your vanilla airdrop. But I think what's not sustainable is the 10,000% APIs that you see on some of these projects, which just come from people bidding the governance tokens. And there are a lot of tricky things that projects can do to jack up the APIs. I agree. I don't think the so called interest is here to stay. It's always misleading when they present these numbers as analyzed numbers, and they show you, like, you can get 500,000% returns by staking this coin.
00:22:11.050 - 00:22:43.364, Speaker B: So that's definitely not sustainable. But I do think that, again, I think it's a function of the market. In a bull market, these yields will be there. But in a bear market, as the price for the coins in which the yields are denominated and come down, the yields will also start crashing. And we kind of had a little taste of that back in September, October, when the Defi summer ended pretty brutally for a lot of people when the curve prices started coming down. So I think a lot of people have short memories, and they kind of forgot about that, and now they're back and forth again.
00:22:47.184 - 00:22:51.352, Speaker A: All right, so are you teaching spartan?
00:22:51.448 - 00:23:19.992, Speaker B: Am I being. Yeah, I got a lot of messages about that throughout the years. So it's funny because I think people didn't realize that the spartan indigenous partner refers to the synthetix community, which calls themselves Spartans. So some of my friends thought, okay, it might refer to, like, spartan capital. And we kind of post about the same projects in the same time zone. So people started kind of putting one and one together. But, no, I'm not Degen Spartan.
00:23:19.992 - 00:23:29.680, Speaker B: I don't know if I'm flattered that people think I am. He seems like a fun guy. Like, I speak to him sometimes on Twitter. I don't know who he is, though.
00:23:29.752 - 00:23:36.974, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. What is behind the name Spartan for Spartan Capital? Why is that name important?
00:23:37.094 - 00:24:06.962, Speaker B: Yeah, so, actually, I didn't come up with that name. The founders of Spartan did. I think back in maybe, like, 2018 ish, early 2018 ish. I think they just kind of like the culture that they stand for. They're probably big fans of the movie 300, and they like the warrior culture. And I think we used to have this page on a website about the spartan principles, which we took down, I think, because we thought it might seem a little bit extreme, but basically, it's like, you know, Spartans, you know, embrace challenge. They push their minds and bodies to the limit.
00:24:06.962 - 00:24:22.774, Speaker B: I thought it's a little on the nose, but it kind of embodies kind of what we like to bring to the table when we work with founders, which is kind of. We try to go to war for our founders. So I think that's really where the name comes from. But, yeah, it's nothing to do with Synthetix or Djen. Spartan.
00:24:24.954 - 00:25:07.892, Speaker A: I love the two things you mentioned, eating glass and going to war. For a founder, those are very much close to home to us. We have, like, I always talk about like, that. It's like the early adopters, like, the devs, especially if they have vision, they're kind of willing to eat glass to get there. Like, it doesn't matter, you know? And, like, the early builders on Ethereum, I think, ate a lot of glass to build these products. Like, I think there was a lot of blood, sweat, and tears that went into building aave into synthetics. And, like, pivoting, like is hard, right? Like, experimenting on a new platform is really hard.
00:25:07.892 - 00:25:17.908, Speaker A: Those folks, I think, are kind of cornerstone to what is really remarkable about, like, the Ethereum community. Do you guys see that, like, emerging.
00:25:17.996 - 00:25:25.610, Speaker B: Anywhere else, merging anywhere else in terms of, uh, kind of projects becoming cornerstone.
00:25:25.682 - 00:25:33.570, Speaker A: Like the, the kind of founders that go like, build these things? Do you see more, more spartans outside of Ethereum?
00:25:33.722 - 00:26:01.728, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So I guess, um, I guess they kind of outside of Ethereum, but, uh, this project that we found in Thailand called Alpha Finance Lab, they're building on both the binance chain and Ethereum. And I think they, they're keen to kind of explore Solana as well. So I can actually introduce you guys after this. But, um, they're an incredibly relentless team. So we found them. And I think they kind of struggled to raise at that time because they were proposing this idea about kind of levered yield farming.
00:26:01.728 - 00:26:29.838, Speaker B: So it's kind of yield farming on steroids. But that was really only part of the vision. They really want to kind of going back to this idea about vertical integration. They want to build this whole suite of products across multiple chains for people to manage all their Defi needs. So I think that vision wasn't really resonant with a lot of the early folks that they talked to in terms of investors. But right now, obviously, they're actually one of the larger projects in Defi in terms of TVL and usage. And they working with Delphi to design a new token model.
00:26:29.838 - 00:26:57.856, Speaker B: And those guys are incredibly relentless. And I think my favorite story is when there was an inner protocol exploit. So they designed this thing where they can lend capital to an uncollateralized basis or under collateralized basis to cream. So it's like an inner protocol loan. And then that mechanism was exploited and there was a $30 million hold, so no user funds were lost. But basically the protocols were owing each other $30 million. So that was obviously a huge setback for any founders.
00:26:57.856 - 00:27:33.854, Speaker B: And for investors, it's not a fun day as well. Price are tanking. People are asking, why did you introduce me to this project? There's a lot of animosity those first few days, and there's a lot of accusations going around who might be behind this hack. But the way the team handled it, it was incredibly professional, very collected. It's almost like they've done this before. And the fact that they kind of came back from that and still kept on building new products, I think is incredibly inspiring because we've seen so many projects that got hacked one time, and then they basically just kind of gave up and fizzled out. So that, to me, is actually a kind of confidence inspiring sign.
00:27:33.854 - 00:27:39.442, Speaker B: If the team can recover from something that should have killed them, that's usually a sign that I should be paying attention.
00:27:39.578 - 00:28:08.404, Speaker A: Yeah, that is a really good point. To me, like, one of those moments was, like, the double black swan, like, last year, and you saw this massive crash and maker almost kind of going down. But the fact that they didn't, to me, was. Was kind of, I think, missed on a lot of people because I immediately thought, oh, wow, this whole thing actually survived. This is, like, Defi actually has legs.
00:28:09.504 - 00:28:42.462, Speaker B: Yeah. It's funny because that's how a lot of people got into crypto as well. Like, when I interview people on my podcast, I think a few dozen of them really decided to spend more time on crypto because they first discovered bitcoin, and they thought it was going to die. They thought it was Ponzi. And then after the price crash, and a few years later, it came back and it's still around and it's bigger, and they started paying attention because of that. I think the rough heuristic that I use is if something should have died, but it didn't, and it's grown after that, then it's usually a really, really good sign that it's probably going somewhere.
00:28:42.558 - 00:28:49.342, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, you know, I'm sure you heard of, like, the $50 billion over leveraged loss, right? And, like.
00:28:49.478 - 00:28:50.030, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:50.142 - 00:28:55.710, Speaker A: Like, that is a bigger loss than all of Defi. Like, in one day from a trade fight group.
00:28:55.822 - 00:28:56.714, Speaker B: One guy.
00:28:57.934 - 00:29:32.516, Speaker A: Yeah, it's one dude that was just, like, messing around. Like, in one day lost $50 billion. I think that the stuff that we're building, like, that, the amazing folks that Kay and, like, Stani are doing, those protocols as they get through the gauntlet of hacks and everything else, I think, are a better form of finance, where those kinds of things can't happen. Right. You have, like, so much experience and so many people trying to hack it that you get through, like, this period of volatility. Right.
00:29:32.620 - 00:29:33.164, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:33.284 - 00:29:39.804, Speaker A: That you get to a point of anti fragility, and it's kind of interesting how emergent these things are.
00:29:39.924 - 00:30:08.846, Speaker B: Yeah. And that example about Bill Huang, that family office slash hedge fund that you mentioned, it's crazy because he was borrowing from all these banks, and none of them knew that he was borrowing from all these banks. So it was incredibly intrasparent. Nobody really knew what the risk exposure was until it was too late, until it blew up. Whereas for DeFi, you can monitor the collateral ratio for every single loan on chain. So you know, exactly what's the risk that you're facing. So that, I think is a massive improvement over the existing system.
00:30:08.846 - 00:30:36.406, Speaker B: But unfortunately, I shouldn't say unfortunately, but it's still incredibly early. So most people still kind of perceive defi as fundamentally more risky than CFI or than traditional finance. But Jeff Dorman from ARCA, which is fund in the US, he actually wrote this great post about how DeFi is actually less risky than traditional finance because of those reasons that you mentioned, because of all these hidden risks that you don't really realize until it's too late, until it blows up.
00:30:36.510 - 00:30:52.194, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. I think to me, this is, like, an obvious win for, like, the use of blockchain is, like, so painfully obvious as, like, the right technology. Do you trust banks more than, like, a hardware wallet?
00:30:52.734 - 00:31:33.120, Speaker B: Personally, I actually don't, but maybe I'm a little bit more extreme. I trust my ability to kind of custody. So I have, I think, well, probably same for a lot of crypto. Probably more funds in a hardware wallet than in my bank. And, you know, just my experience with even setting up a commercial bank account for my podcast, it's horrendous. And I have heard so many stories about people whose bank accounts got frozen because they sent money from FTX back to their bank account. So apparently one way is okay, like, if you send money from your bank account to an exchange, usually they don't flag you, but if you send from an exchange back to a bank, they probably freeze your account, and it takes, like, weeks to unfreeze it.
00:31:33.120 - 00:31:46.872, Speaker B: So my friend was basically stuck with no access to his bank account for, like, weeks, which is insane. So I think it's examples like that that makes me a little bit. Have a little bit less faith in banks than kind of defi.
00:31:47.008 - 00:32:34.774, Speaker A: Yeah, those are, I'm, like, seeing the change from at least, like, in the crypto community or, like, today, like, we went from, like, a period of, like, the stuff barely working to it's mature enough for Coinbase to IPO. We're at the level where I think the technology and the actual stability of it is, at the level that it's extremely sophisticated and robust, but we just haven't hit this commercial scale yet where everybody understands hetero custody. Is that something that you guys kind of track as a fund? Do you look at this market of crypto as the set of people in custody, or do you think of it still in terms of volumes and tvls and all this other stuff?
00:32:35.194 - 00:33:34.884, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question, I think in terms of what generates fees for protocols and token holders is the volume. So that's usually what we track the most. But in terms of custody solutions, we paid a lot of attention to that. But I wouldn't say we're tracking it quantitatively daily, but just anecdotally or qualitatively seeing things like argent coming out with their guardian system, which makes it really easy for you to spin up a wallet without worrying about keeping your seat phrase on a piece of paper locked under a mattress or something like that. It's solutions like that that make us excited that we're seeing crypto come to a less crypto native user base. Recently I did an interview on a local podcast here in Hong Kong, and the host was actually sharing. The host is actually Bonnie, so she's hosting a cantonese podcast here and she was sharing with her users about crypto.
00:33:34.884 - 00:33:46.676, Speaker B: And I think she actually brought a lot of people into crypto through argent because it's so easy to use relative to a ledger. So it's stories like that that make me really excited about the fact that this is just the first wave.
00:33:46.780 - 00:34:17.105, Speaker A: Do you think that adoption is going to come from people understanding the cryptography? Not like deep mathematical understanding, but kind of the same level that my parents understand, like clicking a link on a website. Like, do we need to get to that level of, like, adoption where, like, my parents understand a public key at that depth, they're like, oh, there's a secret and I gotta hide it. They can get that. Like, do we need that level of adoption? Like, worldwide?
00:34:17.269 - 00:35:14.504, Speaker B: I think we probably need some behavioral change. Just looking at the web two cycle back in the nineties, ideas like logins or passwords weren't really a thing, but I think that was probably a little bit easier to understand than most of what's happening in crypto. But even on the fund side, I think in the very beginning, in 2017 or 2016, a lot of the funds investing in crypto are very cryptography heavy. These are all computer scientists or engineers. And then this cycle around, you see a lot of more product folks who might not know how to code or might not understand deep level cryptography, but they have incredible product sense. They know how to almost predict what products would take off. So I map that evolution of your typical fund analyst to your typical crypto user, where in the beginning you have these hardcore people who don't even use the interface for these exchanges.
00:35:14.504 - 00:35:49.512, Speaker B: They kind of just interact directly with the contracts. Then now you have folks who might not know how to, might not have read the white paper for bitcoin, but they know how to use uniswap. So I do think there's a lot of abstraction that's happening and it will continue to happen. And specifically, do I think the average user will understand public private keys in the future? I don't think so. I think you start to see, again, going back to the example of origin that kind of abstracts away all of that for you. So there's elements of that way when you kind of spin up your wallet, you do have to kind of think about that. But then I think it's easy to see how this will all be abstracted for users in the future.
00:35:49.688 - 00:36:31.326, Speaker A: So I feel like there's a clear distinction between users having this high level understanding of crypto versus a deep one. And I almost see AOL keywords. I don't know if you remember the nineties. AOL had these instead of URL's and all this complicated link stuff. You just type in a keyword and you go to go to the thing. And that failed miserably because I think people lost the actual core cool part of the web. You can build this intricate set of documentation links and go down the rabbit hole.
00:36:31.326 - 00:36:48.194, Speaker A: There was this brief moment of time where this magical rabbit hole could take you anywhere. Was that like, I feel like folks that try to abstract things too much in crypto, like, almost end up in that, like a old key world keyboard place.
00:36:48.934 - 00:36:53.542, Speaker B: As in kind of, they take away too much of what's meaningful in crypto.
00:36:53.678 - 00:37:07.334, Speaker A: Exactly. Like, I think the cool thing about it is that with a bit of cryptography, I can go get yields on my dollars that are a thousand times bigger than the bank.
00:37:08.874 - 00:37:44.926, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I guess abstractions are very broad terms. It kind of depends on what you're abstracting away. So for things like Coinbase, you're abstracting away all the key management and custody. And obviously you give up that kind of self custody and trustlessness aspect of it, but you could still access things like, you know, aave technically through a centralized exchange where they could still take your assets and deposit. So I think you might give up some, some kind of aspects of trustlessness, but the composability part should still be available to kind of more abstracted applications, right?
00:37:45.030 - 00:38:22.094, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a difficult question. Right. Like, I think we've seen a ton of users go to coinbase and binance, you know, and FTX and all the other centralized exchanges for, like, the trading, the speculative side of it. But binance, smart chain. Do you think that that is like a mix of that kind of in between world. Like, you still have to use metamask, right? And you're trading on uniswap, or you're depositing like, tokens into, like, the binance smart chain farming products. Is that crypto? Is that, is that, like, close enough?
00:38:22.434 - 00:39:09.654, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really hard question because obviously binance gives up a lot of the, I think, the security or the trustlessness aspect of something like Ethereum. But is that crypto? I think the best way to think about it is probably a spectrum. There's degrees of decentralization and trustlessness. So I definitely would not put smart chain anywhere close to ethereum, but there might be a market for that. I think it's clear that these degens, they don't really think about what's trustless, actually care too much if they can earn a yield, if there's products they can use, if they can trade with no fees, then they will go there. So I think that goes back to the point about customer loyalty. I think the metrics by which loyalty is determined is very different for the early users of crypto.
00:39:09.654 - 00:39:26.772, Speaker B: So the Ethereum maximalists, who really care about the tenets of Ethereum versus the users today, where you have the dgens, who really don't give a shit at all, they kind of just go to whatever chains to give them the lowest fees and highest yields. So, yeah, I don't know if that it is crypto, but there might, there is a market for it.
00:39:26.868 - 00:39:59.504, Speaker A: Yeah. These are hard questions, like how much of the stuff is important versus, like, at some level, I kind of believe that the self custody piece is more important than anything else. Because I think, like, if you actually have my parents understanding self custody, then they can move to any network, right? They can hop from binance smart chain to ethereum to solana to whatever, right. That, like, I think, like, that initial onboarding is almost 99% of the work.
00:39:59.664 - 00:40:12.284, Speaker B: How do you think we can kind of get to the point where, you know, you're, I guess, like, even my parents would understand kind of key management is, do you think we still have a huge leap before we can get there, or are we kind of almost there already?
00:40:13.484 - 00:41:11.400, Speaker A: I think it's interesting that the speculative use case forces people to understand it because of the risks they're taking. If I'm taking, if I'm putting some skin in the game in this stablecoin field farming scheme, there's something actually there that's forcing me to understand what I'm doing. And the risk I'm taking and how that's tied to those twelve keywords. That connection, I think, is really quickly established. When the amount of value I put into that goes to zero or like ten, x, it's just like, I think immediately sinks in. But I don't know if that is scalable to a population that's much bigger than what we currently already onboarded in crypto. I don't know if we've captured all the degens in the world already.
00:41:11.400 - 00:41:12.404, Speaker A: We might have.
00:41:13.894 - 00:41:48.242, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, the DJ market is massive, right? I think especially in places where gambling is outlawed. China has a huge market for DJ's, but I think, yeah, I think that's a great point. Speculation forces people to understand. But then you also see, I'm actually curious what we're seeing from projects like Audius building on Solana, because they're not a speculative use cases, but they also have a lot of kind of crypto native aspects. Do you see kind of users being forced to understand crypto through audius or have they abstracted so much of it away that people don't even know it's crypto?
00:41:48.418 - 00:43:14.564, Speaker A: I think people are excited that there's an audience token in that it's decentralized music because there's always like, there's a different censorship resistant element there, which I think is really interesting and almost goes back to the days before crypto where like sharing of music became like such a hot button thing that like, you know, Google ended up on the right side of the history and like, Napster was on the wrong side of history, even though all of them were like serving the same music. I think with Audius, in the long term, there's this really like kind of genuine way to try to connect the artists and the fans without any of the middle people in between. And that's almost like the social networking part of like, you know, the Vecchi tokens, the stable coins, like building the community side of it. Like if you remove the speculative use case, you have this community of people that kind of came together on the meme or an idea or fandom or whatever, right? Like that part I think is really, really cool. And I think crypto enhances it because it's got. Crypto has this property that no other social networking has where I have to actually spend my dollars to be part of it. I have to go buy the audio token.
00:43:14.564 - 00:43:31.224, Speaker A: I have to go buy the yams. I can't be part of every network. There's simple resistance that's baked into it, that skin in the game actually creates stronger communities. It's much more interesting than, I think, building a social network of the same size.
00:43:32.324 - 00:44:13.884, Speaker B: Yeah. That also reminds me of a point that I wanted to make earlier, which is that speculation, as you mentioned, kind of forces a lot of people to learn crypto, but then there are also other avenues that forces other demographics to learn crypto. So music is probably one of them. And then the other huge one was nfts, right? All these digital artists that didn't really give a shit about bitcoin or ethereum before, like folks, like people, they're forced to learn what an NFT is. They're forced to kind of mint their own nfts because of the opportunity there. So I guess they're the kind of subset of speculators. But if you look at the general profile of people being pulled into crypto through nfts and people who are pulled into crypto through uniswap shitcoins, it's very, very different profiles.
00:44:13.884 - 00:44:26.380, Speaker B: So I'm really excited to see different avenues pulling different personalities into the space. And I can't figure out what's going to be next after NFTs, but I'm sure there's something outside of just pure speculation.
00:44:26.532 - 00:45:00.824, Speaker A: Do you think that the NFT market is like, kind of resembles the high art market where you have, like, collectors or, like, it, like the whole thing around people? Right? It really seems like the Basquiat movie. Like, it's like this guy that's, like, awesome at digital art that's just got, like, promoted into this, like, thing. I don't know, maybe that's not what happened, but, like, it seems very much like high art. Like the story of, like, like, you know, like the kind of art that, like, hits those same numbers at a Christie's auction.
00:45:00.944 - 00:45:28.976, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's, it's. I wouldn't pretend to say that. Well, first of all, I think NFTs as an idea, as an identity layer for basically anything, not just art, is really powerful. But I do think the NFT art specific movement is basically just digitized high art. Right. There's not nothing that besides the ownership aspect of it and the digitized aspect of it, the underlying art is still the same. The market is still the same, the auction still held by, you know, the auctioneers.
00:45:28.976 - 00:46:03.786, Speaker B: So I personally, you know, I'm not putting money into crypto art just because I don't understand where the value is coming from. I'm not as excited about the opportunity for the specific pieces of art. I'm excited for the opportunity that seems to be giving to artists. But, yeah, I think there's a lot of same concerns that people bring up for NFT art and high art. People are concerned that these things will be used for money laundering. People are concerned that most of the participants are just whales who have $60 million to throw around for a piece of art. And it's not really that kind of broad based of a user base.
00:46:03.786 - 00:46:06.298, Speaker B: So I think those are valid concerns that are shared by both.
00:46:06.466 - 00:46:36.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I've never been a part of large scale art, but I bought art, but usually it's like $500 would be the most that it spent on something. And there's a lot of artists just make money off that. Like, I am, I'm trying to, like, imagine when would I be in a position to, like, spend a couple hundred bucks on an NFT? Like, do you, do you see yourself getting there, like, at some point?
00:46:36.134 - 00:47:00.092, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that that's why. So I did this two part podcast episode with the guys from one confirmation. They're huge NFT fans and they're really, really insightful and forward thinking. And they actually helped me see the light on a lot of defi stuff. But we disagree a lot of NFT stuff because I think their view is that NFT is more populous than DeFi. Defi is very elitist. It's all these complex instruments.
00:47:00.092 - 00:47:33.936, Speaker B: But then NFT is about art and community and all these things. But I actually disagree with that because as you mentioned, I think a lot of the largest sales or the, or the highest volume of transactions is generated by the whales who can afford to pay $5,000 for a duck, and they'll be like, I'm okay with that. So I don't think most people will get there. I still think that this resembles high art. So personally, I'm not as involved in buying NFT art. Maybe one day I'll get there, but for now, it's not something that I'm very terribly excited by.
00:47:34.040 - 00:48:09.668, Speaker A: Yeah, I would love for the world to get there because I think having this, like, channel for artists, right, like, to get connected to their fans and to get effectively, like, you know, funded. Right, like, to actually go, go continue. Like, doing artful time would be awesome. But I'm not sure I haven't, like, quite nailed it yet. Like, I used to play, you know, like, ultima online everquests. And in those games, I noticed that as soon as you had enough people playing it, they kind of self created economies. People would start selling.
00:48:09.668 - 00:48:47.008, Speaker A: Just the gold was kind of the basic thing. Like whatever the gold was in the game, people would get too much of it and sell it to people that didn't have enough of it. And that was just obvious, right? That just happened naturally. There was like a black market would establish, but there was also like other markets for like really rare items that not necessarily had any like impact or interest in the game outside of being rare. And I don't know where this phenomenon comes from. From people. Like, it seems like whenever we like, start forming societies that we start collecting shiny objects.
00:48:47.176 - 00:49:38.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's also a function of wealth. I think, you know, last cycle we saw nfts kind of take off at the end of the cycle where a lot of wealth was already created in shitcoins and in kind of bitcoin and people trickled a lot of their wealth into art. And I think to a certain degree it's kind of happening this cycle as well, where a lot of people got really rich off of other tokens and they started kind of divesting into art. And it's kind of bootstrapped the emergence of this new market or this new economy. I think what I am excited about for NFT art is the fact that you could create defi markets around this. So we're already seeing projects that create kind of appraisal markets for the value of nfts or allow you to fractionalize your nfts or even put your nfts down as collateral to kind of take out loans. So compared to traditional high art, I think that frees up a lot of the value.
00:49:38.110 - 00:49:53.554, Speaker B: Whereas usually it's basically just a piece of painting that's hanging in some billionaire's wall. Now you can digitize it and actually free up the value and create a new economy around that. So that probably is a little bit far out, but that's something that I think would excite me about art.
00:49:53.674 - 00:50:39.540, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, I mean, the fact that if these things have value and price discovery, that you could actually create markets for them. And if you have markets, you can do borrowed lending, all of finance those mechanisms. I'm curious how they'll kind of play out. I'm worried about the proliferation of the number of items and kind of like the lack of liquidity to support all of them. And that seems like a black swan, not in just crypto, but like the rest of the world too. It's like just, I don't know, like, you know, a lot of companies going public, a lot of aspects like the amount of stuff that you have to like, market make and like, do discovery on just keeps blowing up.
00:50:39.540 - 00:50:41.948, Speaker A: There's 32,000 uniswap pairs.
00:50:41.996 - 00:50:42.904, Speaker B: It's crazy.
00:50:45.884 - 00:50:54.384, Speaker A: Like, if you start making markets for every individual unique item, where's the liquidity going to come from? For everything?
00:50:54.764 - 00:51:20.798, Speaker B: Yeah. So at some point, it will become untenable. There will be too many items and assets to be supported by the same pool of capital. I think that's when the bubble bursts. But then what we saw from 2017, when the bubble subsided, is it left behind all these key pieces. So maybe at the end of the next cycle, maybe at the end of this cycle, there won't be 22,000 pairs. Maybe like 5000 pairs remain, but all the others kind of die.
00:51:20.798 - 00:51:37.406, Speaker B: But then the 5000 pairs that remain might go on to do kind of actually interesting use cases. But I agree. I think there's definitely a concern that we're getting to a period of excess where there's way too many random pieces of nfts just commanding hundreds of thousands of dollars in value today.
00:51:37.510 - 00:51:46.140, Speaker A: What are you guys excited about as the next wave? Have you looked into daos or, like, kind of social networking or social coins?
00:51:46.332 - 00:52:11.962, Speaker B: Yeah, so I guess two things on that. So daos, I do think everything is converging there, because last cycle, you saw a lot of coins talking about governance, right? So Tezos was all about governance. Ethereum's narrative was hugely dominated by governance as well. And a huge part of my podcast was also about governance, but there was nothing to govern. Whereas this cycle around, there's. There's. I think there's like 50 billion in Ethereum alone for TVL to be governed.
00:52:11.962 - 00:53:12.706, Speaker B: So it becomes a necessity. So I've always debated, how would this play out? Is it going to be where every project is going to become their own dao? Will there be some consensus around what Dao frameworks they will use? Will everyone be using Dao Stack or Aragon? I think the evidence is pointing towards the former, where people are just spinning up their own daos, maybe using pieces from here and there, like Snapshot and whatnot. But there's no consensus framework for how a Dao should look like or what key pieces it should be using. So I'm still looking for kind of how to express a view there and for social tokens. I was actually one of the first guys to issue a token on this app called Roll for Blockcrunch for the podcast, but I couldn't figure out a use case for it. So now it's just kind of sitting in my wallet doing nothing, and I feel like that's going to be the outcome for a lot of social tokens where people can't figure out the use case for it. But then I saw Bitcloud, this kind of new project that's issuing a social token for everyone, sometimes without their permission, and people still seem to use it, especially non crypto natives.
00:53:12.706 - 00:53:29.594, Speaker B: I'm hearing so many stories from people who are just really excited about the fact that they can buy tokens for their favorite creators, even though there's no use case for the token. So maybe you don't need a use case. Maybe it's just the meme around the token. But yeah, these two are things that I'm definitely paying attention to a lot and I'm still trying to wrap my head around.
00:53:29.674 - 00:53:46.794, Speaker A: Cool. Very cool. Like, me too. These are, I think, really fascinating things that have come out in the cycle in like the last couple of months. This has been like a super fun conversation. I think we've went over time. So, like, I'm really excited to talk to you and catch up.
00:53:46.794 - 00:53:50.578, Speaker A: It really feels like a decade has passed since the last time we talked.
00:53:50.706 - 00:53:57.506, Speaker B: It's nuts. It's. Yeah, I mean, one year in crypto is like three years, so it's been an insane amount of time.
00:53:57.570 - 00:54:00.290, Speaker A: Yeah, right on. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show.
00:54:00.362 - 00:54:01.874, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. This is really fun.
