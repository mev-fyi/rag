00:00:00.320 - 00:00:18.934, Speaker A: Welcome to the Solana Changelog, where we go through the changes every week on Solana. My name is Jacob. I'm joined today with Joe. Happy new year. It's good to be back. Let's get started with this. So if you've been looking through the Solana improvement document proposals recently, there's been a lot.
00:00:18.934 - 00:01:02.222, Speaker A: I think we're up to number 16 right now, and that's exactly what we'll go after today, is that the SIMD 16 has application fees for writable accounts. That's kind of the title of it. So let's talk about it, see what it's about. So, SIMD 16, what it does is it allows a application like a Dapp to be able to set fees for a writable account. So what does that mean? It's more of, like, every account that you can change, like, say you have a token balance in it and you want to change it from one to two. The application can set a fee for changing that balance. So what do you think about that, Joe?
00:01:02.398 - 00:01:12.634, Speaker B: How does that work in the example that you're kind of describing, like, how does my application have the authority to set those fees? Like, technically?
00:01:13.254 - 00:01:49.894, Speaker A: Right. So as part of this proposal, there's going to be a new program for application fees. So what you can do is you can set fees for. If you. If basically, if you own the program, you can set fees for writable accounts on the program. So that, like, for example, say you have orca trading on a market and people are trading on a specific market, and that market's really hot, you can actually, orca can change it that fees for that market and make it higher or lower at their will so that they can kind of manage the user experience and how people trade on the market.
00:01:51.074 - 00:02:07.142, Speaker B: Interesting. So would you say that. That I feel like that sort of competes with the idea of having more of a market based fee setting? Right. That's a little bit more of like an authoritative, almost centralized way of doing things, wouldn't you say?
00:02:07.198 - 00:02:48.644, Speaker A: Or no, there is kind of a discussion around that, and it's part of the discussion on assimd. It also kind of. It goes hand in hand with, like, okay, SIMD 16 is these application fees that are designated by the actual Dapps that run applications on the network. And then there's also, like, SIMD, I think it's four, which is kind of like changing the base fees and fees based off of computation computational costs. So they're really, like, this is kind of like, another idea for, like, how economics can change to be better for the user, it's still a proposal. So, like, open for discussion.
00:02:49.444 - 00:03:08.356, Speaker B: Yeah. And there's obviously a lot of aspects to it there, like tons of different ways you can look at it. But just, I encourage anybody who wants to kind of, like, weigh in on that. Go ahead. Like, that's part of the proposal process. You know, like, we want public opinion. We want to have as many kind of, like, ideas flowing around and thoughts on different proposals.
00:03:08.356 - 00:03:10.196, Speaker B: So go ahead and weigh in.
00:03:10.380 - 00:03:24.512, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead. There's also the people that created it. They have a PoC, so you can actually try it out and see what it looks like for you and get the hands and feel of it. And then what is the resource this week, Joe?
00:03:24.648 - 00:03:57.914, Speaker B: Yeah, so technically, not exactly a resource per se, but a very, very helpful bit for anybody who's a developer. There's a hackathon being put on by Helios Labs and Lamport Dao, and they've got tons of sponsors, tons of prizes. It's called Sandstorm, and that runs from, I believe, January 10 to the 23rd. It's an online virtual hackathon. You can sign up with Lamport Dao and you can check out the site. We'll have a link in the description here. But, yeah, jump in there, build something cool.
00:03:57.914 - 00:04:04.034, Speaker B: Try to kick off the new year with some cool prize money and start some of those projects you've been thinking about.
00:04:04.494 - 00:04:17.154, Speaker A: Cool. And also, if you have questions on things while you're developing in this new hackathon, feel free to ask them on either the Solana Stack Exchange and discord, etcetera. There's tons of people willing to help out.
00:04:18.014 - 00:04:19.310, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:04:19.462 - 00:04:46.314, Speaker A: And then some commits. That happened this past week. There was kind of a change to be able to count non vote transactions as well as vote transactions kind of separately in the bank. This kind of allows you to get a more realistic TPS view that gets sampled. Performance RPC call so that is a recent change that happened. It's not live yet, but it's been pulled in.
00:04:46.734 - 00:04:54.654, Speaker B: So you'd be able to see the transaction count on Solana with the vote transactions omitted if you wanted.
00:04:54.814 - 00:04:56.154, Speaker A: If you wanted, yeah.
00:04:56.614 - 00:05:02.274, Speaker B: Cool. That'll help give a good amount of insight into, like, what the network's up to. I like that.
00:05:02.734 - 00:05:04.594, Speaker A: And what did you see, Joe?
00:05:06.214 - 00:05:29.196, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a bunch of stuff that people have been up to. The gang is back at work, but I noticed that the closed accounts now appear on the explorer, which is kind of cool. So you can see that account has been closed. You can get confirmation there. And there was some stuff about commission changes too, right? Maybe talk about that a little bit.
00:05:29.380 - 00:06:22.534, Speaker A: Yeah. So there was a pr pulled in, kind of locking, in a way commission changes in the second half of an epic. So what we were kind of saying recently was that some validators were changing their commission rates at the last minute, which is not a great user experience. So in order to kind of, like, give time for users to react to maybe malicious validators changing their commission rates, the commission changes would be locked with this feature at the second half of the epic, giving a decent amount of time for people to react if their validator is changing things. It also makes it more public of, like, someone changed it. It's very easy to tell because, like, it'll be locked for x amount of time versus switching it up and then switching back within a few seconds.
00:06:23.514 - 00:06:31.454, Speaker B: So that obviously, you know, has a lot of benefit for users there. But is there any kind of, like, drawbacks from that for validators, like, for honest validators?
00:06:31.994 - 00:07:01.134, Speaker A: I think it kind of changes the way that you can change commission. Like, if you can't change it as quickly, you'll have to wait until the second half of the epic is complete. Now, note this. It was pulled in, but this will probably have to come up to a validator to vote to actually implement. So it will be a discussion across validators of whether or not, hey, we should vote this to be into the network or should we just keep it the way it is in the current state?
00:07:02.174 - 00:07:05.718, Speaker B: So, no. Did you see anything else for commits at all, or.
00:07:05.886 - 00:07:10.834, Speaker A: No, that was just about it. Everybody's just getting warmed up and getting started for the new year.
00:07:11.854 - 00:07:26.966, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be a big year. You can already feel the sentiment. You know, I think the community's already coming back online. Everybody got a little bit of rest, so it's good to see. And we'll bring you guys more changes next week as per usual. But thanks for joining us. We'll catch you next time.
00:07:27.110 - 00:07:27.774, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
