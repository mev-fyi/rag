Just google how to get definite Sol and you will find this nice article on solana.com which shows you five ways on how to get definite Sol. So the first one is the Solana CLI which lets you request up to ten Sol per day. Then there is the Solana web faucet and here you just put your address and then you can request up to ten Sol per hour. There's also a few RPC providers which are running their own faucets. So if you request an airdrop you can just add the URL behind your request and then you have a way better chance of getting solid. Then theres also proof of work faucet, so in case you need bigger amounts you can just use this and it generates Sol over time.

So for example the 76 devs discord and the Lampard Dao discord. And then heres a little bonus tip, you can just use Solana program show which shows you all the programs that you already deployed on Devnet and then you can use Solana program close to close a few of them. Then you get the sol out of the programs and then you can just use it to deploy the next one.
