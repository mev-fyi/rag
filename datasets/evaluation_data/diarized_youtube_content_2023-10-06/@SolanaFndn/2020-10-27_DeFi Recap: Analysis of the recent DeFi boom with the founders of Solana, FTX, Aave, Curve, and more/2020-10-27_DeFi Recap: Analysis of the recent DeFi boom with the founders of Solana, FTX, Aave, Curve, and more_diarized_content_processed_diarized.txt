00:00:11.040 - 00:00:44.220, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone, to the second event of the Solana wormhole hackathon. Today we are doing a DeFi recap where we're going to do an analysis of the recent DeFi boom and a look into the next future and wave of Defi. We have an absolutely incredible, incredible panel for you all today. We have Sani, who is the founder of Aave. We have Tyron, who is the CEO and founder of Gauntlet. We have Jeremy, who is head of growth from Balancer. Michael, who is the founder and CEO of Curve.
00:00:44.220 - 00:01:19.696, Speaker A: Anatoly, who is the CEO and co founder of Solana. And then we have Sam Bankman Fried, who is the CEO and founder of Alameda Research and FTX, who will be taking my spot in just a moment. I appreciate you all tuning in. It's going to be about an hour long conversation and just a few quick recaps. We have a chat section, which I see a lot of folks already making use of. And we also have a questions tab. So throughout the panel, just kind of post your questions in there, and we'll spend the last ten or 15 minutes answering them all for you.
00:01:19.720 - 00:01:20.284, Speaker B: All.
00:01:20.904 - 00:01:41.314, Speaker A: You can up vote questions in the tab, and we'll probably take the top five to not take up too much time. So once again, thank you. Thank you all for the panelists for joining us. And have fun. I'm gonna jump off stage now, and I'll bring Sam on. Totally.
00:01:41.934 - 00:02:22.404, Speaker B: It's all you. Awesome. Hey, folks. Like, I mean, normally we'd be grabbing a beer at a bar somewhere at a conference, but looks like we get to do this over zoom this time, but, like, really cool to see everyone again. So, like, we had a kind of a crazy, like, summer, I would say, like, we launched, like, three days after the black swan of, like, in, like, march, and we thought, like, the world is going to fall apart. And turns out, it didn't. Turns out, actually, like, a lot of cool stuff was.
00:02:22.404 - 00:03:11.864, Speaker B: Folks have been building a lot of really cool stuff in the background, and I couldn't have even predicted a perfect opportunity to trial this stuff because all of a sudden, you had a million of the most innovative and intelligent people all stuck at home looking for something to do interesting in crypto. And I think that was, like, a big part of it. I kind of want to give you guys a chance to introduce yourselves and briefly mention what you're working on and what you see DeFi coming out of this boom into, I think, how do you see the space maturing? So I'm going to go down the list of you folks, as it looks like on my screen, which could be different. So I'll start with Jeremy first.
00:03:12.964 - 00:04:02.044, Speaker C: Sure. Thanks Anatoly. My name is Jeremy Musigi. I'm the head of growth at Balancer Labs. I support the community driven expansion of the Balancer protocol, previously founded and sold two tech companies. I've been a crypto investor and researcher since 2013, and a little about balancer. It's a generalized AMM protocol, which serves as a building block for DeFi and powers a lot of different types of applications, including decentralized exchange index funds that are managed or automated, fair and transparent, ideal token sales and smart treasuries, and a lot more.
00:04:05.724 - 00:04:17.220, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, really cool. Really good to have you. And Michael Igorov, do you want to kind of introduce yourselves real quick?
00:04:17.252 - 00:04:51.834, Speaker D: Yeah, sure, sure. Yes. Michael, founder of Curve and well, curve started in January this year and worked without any token before August. And now we have a dao and it's fully decentralized and looks like it's got right in time with all the defi boom and all the demand for on chain liquidity. Well, and that obviously applies to balancer too, right?
00:04:54.914 - 00:05:03.586, Speaker B: So briefly, just to focus on now, Prov is primarily focused for stablecoins and balancers. Kind of like baskets of random things.
00:05:03.730 - 00:05:04.694, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:05:06.034 - 00:05:30.034, Speaker B: And to me, it's been cool to see how you go from a very simple concept of an amm and now how things are fracturing and specializing, and that there's just a ton of innovation happening kind of going into the specialization side. So, Stani, if I pronounced your name correctly, can you introduce yourself and Ave.
00:05:31.734 - 00:06:10.088, Speaker E: Sure. So, I'm Stani. I'm the founder and CEO of Aave. Aave is a team that contributes to the Aave protocol, which is a decentralized money market protocol practically. The idea is to have for cryptographic assets on chain interest rate in transparent, permissionless fashion. And I've been hustling this defi thing for a few years now. Before we used to be called ETH lend, which is short for Ethereum lending.
00:06:10.088 - 00:07:09.384, Speaker E: That was the first on chain lending protocol. And I think this year, as we launched in January, it has been very amazing year for us, mostly because we finally see like good amount of ecosystem activity compared to what it used to be a couple of years ago. And for us it has been pretty nice traction so far. And in terms of functionality, how our protocol is interesting is that all the liquidity that's in the smart contracts that isn't borrowed out can be used to flash borrow, so you can take a flash loan for one ethereum transaction and do all kinds of things and then return the flash loan as well. So that's kind of our thing. And now we're focusing on our version two and getting the whole protocol more decentralized.
00:07:12.804 - 00:07:45.374, Speaker B: That's super cool. Like, flash loans are one of those things that kind of, like, mentally blew me away as. As folks both thought, as like, a bug. But I always, like, immediately saw it as, like, almost like garbage collection, like you do in, like, Java or something like that. But for finance, it just seems like a beautiful, like, construct to be able to, like, do this, like, atomic thing within, like, a financial system. It's pretty cool stuff. And, like, actually, Tarun is the next in my screen.
00:07:45.374 - 00:07:52.094, Speaker B: Him and I had, like, a podcast where we argued about the stuff mostly in agreement. So, like, I don't know. Do you want to introduce yourself?
00:07:53.514 - 00:08:53.954, Speaker F: Hey, yeah, I'm Tarun. I'm the founder and CEO of Gauntlet. We basically do economic stress testing and governance participation in DeFi protocols, and we're working on a system to help sort of automate a lot of quantitative decisions people have to do, generating recommendations and making it so that, you know, you don't have to understand what, you know, the analog of Libor is in Aave or compound or, you know, what, you know, what type of portfolio you're holding in curve when you're LP. Yeah, and I guess I've been kind of in the space in a bunch of different ways for a while, and I think it's been interesting to see the financialization narrative finally come true after a few years of kind of watching proof of stake kind of almost get to this level of hyper financialization and then miss it sort of recently.
00:08:57.594 - 00:09:03.094, Speaker B: Cool. Awesome. Yeah, and, like, I think the last person on the list, Sam.
00:09:08.034 - 00:10:01.936, Speaker G: My name is Sam. I'm the CEO and co founder of Alameda Research and FTX, and I've also been spearheading project serum. And, I mean, whatever, there's a lot going on, and I tweet about it, like, too many times a day. So probably this is just repetitive for most people, but I know, I guess sort of, like, newest things coming out here is from a high level, I think on the serum side, we sort of see the order books is like the most impressive and powerful thing that we could release and probably single most useful thing and most powerful proof of concept, but it's not a decentralized ecosystem in and of itself. It's one dap. I think it's the way we think about it. But serum is sort of meant to be way more than one DaP, and I think composability is a huge piece of that.
00:10:01.936 - 00:10:21.894, Speaker G: And so I think what we're looking at over the next month is a ton of other Dapps coming out on Solana, all composing within the serum ecosystem, which I think will sort of take it from the best decks to a fully fledged decentralized ecosystem.
00:10:23.794 - 00:11:25.724, Speaker B: Awesome. So I'll kind of give a brief intro if folks who don't know who I am, you're in the Solana hackathon. I hope you know that. I'm the co founder, CEO, and Solana is like, the weird thing about the project is when I started it, I had this idea that we're going to decentralize Nasdaq, and it was literally pounding the table that these systems are places for traders to connect and figure out a price on something and do it in the most fastest, low latency, open way possible. It was really hard for, I think, folks to get that vision until this defi boom happened. Then I think, in retrospect, it's obvious that almost like Ethereum is like an exchange where price discovery occurs through Amms and other protocols. And now Solana was designed for this idea of a glob style price discovery, which is a bit more throughput intensive.
00:11:25.724 - 00:12:04.924, Speaker B: And I'm excited to see, like, I think both of these roles combined. Do you guys like, from your perspective and how you're building your financial instruments, do you see layer ones as separate ecosystems, all part of the same ecosystem? Is it like Android versus iOS, where you're going to end up building on both? Or is it more like Solana is finance and Ethereum is Huobi? And you're plugged in on Huobi right now, and then eventually you'll move over to another one simply because this is where money moves. What do you guys see layer one as, from your point of view?
00:12:09.244 - 00:13:10.324, Speaker C: I think from the point of view of a project like a Dex like balancer, I think it makes sense for a decentralized project to have a home on a particular layer one. But I also think there's, there can be a lot of value to bridging and connecting and interoperating with other layer ones. I think that one of the big challenges with expanding or building your protocol on other blockchains, like if you're an Ethereum based project, for example, is that it's really hard to manage a project that lives on multiple chains. It's not two times as hard to be on two chains. It might be, I don't know, four times as hard or something like that. So I think there are definitely pros and cons.
00:13:13.184 - 00:13:30.464, Speaker B: Yeah. Kid number three is the easiest. Cause you've already established some scale into dealing with kids, but I could see the second one is kind of the hardest, typically like. Michael, what are your thoughts?
00:13:31.964 - 00:14:25.368, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's usually very hard for a different layer one chain to take off because I think that network effects of layer one are the strongest. And although Ethereum is super slow compared to some other chains, like Solana, it's still, everything lives on Ethereum. Of course, it's very secure. That's good. But yeah, the speed is not really great. And it would be nice to see, like to see maybe either other chains being used as instead of L2 or maybe L2 solutions. But for that to happen, I guess one needs exactly the same form of smart contracts being executable there, so, like, you don't have to rewrite.
00:14:25.368 - 00:15:16.504, Speaker D: And also there is always a question of compatibility, like, how do you interact with everything else? And if one project goes to one l two, another goes to another l two, third project goes to, like, to Solana, another project goes to Polkadot, and then, like, this doesn't compose, and then everything is still on Ethereum, so. And, yeah, so that's, yeah, I don't know, like, but like, of course, if Ethereum scaling in it doesn't come soon in a convenient form, we will be forced to go somewhere. But I don't know what exactly will be the chain where scaling scaling happens. Will it be some ethereum l two, or will it be Solana, for example?
00:15:18.394 - 00:16:12.092, Speaker G: Yeah, to sort of tack onto that. I think Michael really hit the nail on the head there with composability being the brutal thing when you try to do anything other than all congregate on the same l one, because you just very quickly start losing a bunch of pieces of composability and a bunch of sort of the core value of it and anything. Core composability is extremely powerful and also is somehow still underutilized in DeFi right now. I think a lot of the growth potential is utilizing it better than it is right now. And you sort of start backsliding if you start fracture. And that's certainly been one of the, one of the biggest challenges for serum, for salon, and for any other layer one. I think people are underestimating how big of a challenge that's going to be for L2s, as sort of Michael pointed out.
00:16:12.092 - 00:16:25.344, Speaker G: Like, I think people see ll two s as like the magical solution to this. But I think it's actually terrible on these grounds. Like, it's sort of like the whole idea is fracturing everyone between lots of like, only dubiously composable ecosystems.
00:16:26.804 - 00:18:15.932, Speaker E: Yeah, I think like one of the things about even like related to the hackathon here and like ecosystem wise, like the problem, for example, for Aave, is that when looking at this various different L2 solutions, and as Michael pointed out, it's very difficult to be the kind of like a first mover to go somewhere, especially kind of like if the ecosystem doesn't exist and you can't like copy whole system that is for example in Ethereum, and just replicate it, for example, in another blockchain or L2, because kind of like the idea of the ecosystem borns from the roots. So basically, what if you look at something like Solana and this kind of events, like hackathons and building things, the idea is actually to kind of like get some ideas and build new, interesting products. There might be amms, there might be lending protocols, there might be something else, but they have their own twist, and that makes it interesting to get the liquidity there. Projects like AAVE is even more challenging because we have to follow orders, like we have to follow basically the index liquidity, that there's secondary market prices, possibility to liquidate positions, and then of course that there's some kind of issuance, for example, stable coins and assets in general. But it's very difficult. But I think in some way I see, you know, that there doesn't need to be even like a situation where one layer, two wins everything, or that's used because, I mean, you could apply different level of security on different kinds of transactions. You know, if you want the level of security and compatibility of ethereum, settle there.
00:18:15.932 - 00:18:50.344, Speaker E: Settle as often as you want there. If you want something more high frequency, basically you could use Solana and settle transactions, for example, there and a bunch of other things. So it really probably starts to become more ecosystem of categories. It might be like where you want to trade high frequency, where you, for example, just need deep liquidity for lending or some other swaps. So I think categorization might be something that happens, but still liquidity will move from one place to another.
00:18:53.184 - 00:18:55.324, Speaker B: Tarun, what are your thoughts?
00:18:55.744 - 00:19:24.480, Speaker F: Yeah, I guess the thing I would add to this is proof of work is a well battle tested form of security, and it has a lot of advantages over most things for data availability reasons for people dropping out, reasons for some partition types of problems. And I think having a decade of experience with that is the reason that the majority of stablecoin velocity is staying.
00:19:24.512 - 00:19:25.216, Speaker E: On proof of work.
00:19:25.240 - 00:20:53.324, Speaker F: And you're not going to really see meaningful stablecoin velocity off proof of work chains for a while until there is actually really a decade long cv for a proof of stake chain. That really makes asset managers and those with significant funds being willing to rebalance portfolios. That being said, I think it's kind of, there's going to be an evolution similar in weird ways, less to financial systems, but a little bit like the Linux kernel, where the Linux kernel took 20 plus years to actually do multithreading and multiprocessing correctly, to get the scheduler working, get SMP working, get all the requests for ownership, state machines working, all the stuff that you used to do, anatoly in hardware, that type of stuff took 20 plus years for the Linux kernel. That was why Microsoft won for a long time. I see the same thing developing where you have hierarchy of systems with different levels of security. Like Stanley said, kind of different kind of homogeneous ecosystem until all of these kind of threading and processor problems are solved and we're just not. This is the 1970s in computing right now.
00:20:55.744 - 00:21:42.984, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I tend to agree. Like these systems like just require, like, I don't think it's going to take another ten years, right? The next iteration usually takes half the time. So it's going to take five years for these new systems to establish the same kind of gut level security as proof of work. So I'm curious with what you mentioned about stablecoins and how you guys see the space, are the assets that we're going to be trading, are they going to be more native assets or issued assets, like external stuff coming in, or is it going to be like native foreign things that are running on the chain? Like where do you guys see like kind of like the near term.
00:21:45.084 - 00:22:11.564, Speaker G: How would you. There are three law things I don't know how to classify there. Like, you know, would you classify, you know, Huobi token as a native ERC 20 token? Let's ignore, maybe they're gonna come up with their own chain or something like that. Or is that like a know, just some like asset thing? Like how do you, how do you think about something which is neither a stable coin nor like a, you know, and like really fundamental to the chain?
00:22:12.904 - 00:22:24.312, Speaker B: I would say like because they kind of control it. The control it. I don't know. That's a good question. That's like you can. How, what's the difference between that and the governance token. Right.
00:22:24.312 - 00:22:34.994, Speaker B: Like it's just a corporation called Kobe is what's controlling it. It's almost. It's hard to say. Like, I don't know, but I guess.
00:22:35.074 - 00:22:36.174, Speaker E: Do you see that?
00:22:36.914 - 00:22:37.962, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
00:22:38.098 - 00:22:47.774, Speaker D: Yeah, but I guess your question was more like about something like USDC, which is an external asset versus, I don't know. Dai. Right.
00:22:49.114 - 00:22:52.450, Speaker B: USDC is obvious. Right. So it's like maybe euro, right?
00:22:52.522 - 00:23:27.754, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess. Like, I guess both. Like, we will probably see more assets which are coming from the real world. Like more currencies, like, I don't know, euro, swiss franc, whatever. And they probably will work really well for deposits. Like, for example, there is a redeemable korean one which is currently not very much used, but maybe deep liquidity created for that. It will be used because it can be deposited with, let's say, zero fee.
00:23:27.754 - 00:23:53.552, Speaker D: And if it's. If there is a good amm between korean won and USDC, maybe. Maybe it will be used for, like, for korean people to go into crypto and. Yeah, I guess same applies to all fiat currencies. And also, maybe, I don't know, there are also stocks, I don't know, gold, whatever. But also there are native assets. Tokens for Avi.
00:23:53.552 - 00:23:56.804, Speaker D: They are native assets. Right. And.
00:23:59.144 - 00:24:03.312, Speaker E: Maybe we need to have the pool. We need to have the pool in Kirby.
00:24:03.368 - 00:24:19.314, Speaker D: Yes, yes, yes. Right. We need to finally roll it out. That's right. And also there are assets like staked assets. Like, for example, there are like many stakeable projects out there.
00:24:19.344 - 00:24:19.846, Speaker G: There.
00:24:19.990 - 00:24:52.640, Speaker D: I don't know, like nucypher, keep live, peer, that's only on Ethereum. Also like Polkadot, tezos, whatever. And I can see staking derivatives being also some blockchain native assets. So they are not external. They are really native to blockchain. And I can quite see how they can be. They can be useful.
00:24:52.640 - 00:24:56.928, Speaker D: So like, yeah, both actually.
00:24:57.016 - 00:25:52.498, Speaker F: I want to step in on the staking dervish point because I definitely agree that that's the way that proof of stake actually gets the money velocity. That looks kind of like the money velocity associated to proof of work chains. If you think about the history of cryptocurrencies in 20 2011 through 13, everything revolved around miner financing. Everyone who's a miner had a bunch of bitcoin. They wanted to borrow against it. They wanted to sell quanto derivatives, kind of indexed against a bitcoin based oracle, which is how we got bitmaxed. And there was the whole ecosystem of derivatives and trading really grew around minor finance, both in terms of pooling, dealing with the fpvs, for pools, dealing with income sharing agreements, making the derivatives exchanges make sense.
00:25:52.498 - 00:26:49.684, Speaker F: And in proof of stake, we don't see that level of financial activity amongst validators, partially because validators are reminding of miners in 2010. They're kind of very unsophisticated financially, and it takes a while for the infrastructure to kind of be around so that they don't have to really, really know the devil and the details. But once you actually enable lending for validators and stakers in the same way that lenders existed for proof of work vehicles, both for pools as well as for hardware lending and hardware borrowing, you'll start to see a much higher money velocity that will require stablecoin velocity to also be on the proof of stake chains. And whether those are native or whether those are USDC just really depends on the validators financial needs themselves. And that remains to be seen if the validator pool is similarly averse to the BSA as miners are.
00:26:51.064 - 00:27:26.664, Speaker E: Interesting, by the way, how much, even thinking about something like native, kind of stable coins such as Dai, basically how much there is also the underlying that derives from a custodian asset. And kind of like, we actually don't have that many clean stable coins that are crypto native, which aren't at some way deriving from the underlying, let's say, dollar, that it's, that it's flipping on a bank account.
00:27:27.324 - 00:27:51.124, Speaker G: I think there's just no way almost theoretically, to do that. Like there's no concept of a dollar on a blockchain any, any way. Like eventually it's all gonna have to bottom out into a bank account or with a centralized custodian or an oracle onto some company that has a bank account with a centralized custodian, or, you know, you can put different intermediaries there, but I mean, it's all coinbase in the end.
00:27:51.164 - 00:27:57.564, Speaker B: Sort of zero knowledge to other. There's an unknown number of deposits.
00:28:08.744 - 00:28:09.032, Speaker E: I.
00:28:09.048 - 00:29:19.914, Speaker B: Wanted to like clarify. I think that there's like a clear distinction between like a central company or corporation issuing a token like Kobe, and something that is like a decentralized protocol with governance tied to the activities of the ecosystem. And I think those are two different things. Like Kobe is like an interesting kind of like sits in between because they are an exchange that is clearly in the ecosystem in the broader sense. But it's not like Kobe's running on Solana or Ethereum, right? Like I think like Dai or AAve or balancer, like protocols that are like curve. Like, you know, like that they are in the ecosystem and that activity is part of it, right? Like, it's like kind of in the box. Like, do you guys, so do you guys see that in the box tokens, like, as being like higher value, like, in terms of, like, long term? Or do, are we going to just see kind of like a mixed bag of, like, you know, Tesla stocks and apple stocks and all this other stuff or whatever? You know, whoever takes the plunge first in United States.
00:29:26.414 - 00:29:27.678, Speaker G: I guess I get that.
00:29:27.806 - 00:29:29.118, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead, Sam.
00:29:29.286 - 00:30:25.310, Speaker G: I was gonna say, like, I think that, like, there's. I. I think a lot of it, medium term, is gonna be related to something from outside the ecosystem. If you think about, like, and I think the only, like, I think Dexs are maybe an exception to this. Or like, various things that charge on chain fees are like a sort of an exception to this. But, you know, sort of outside of that, it almost has to be have some relation to something from outside. But if e five really grows a lot and a lot of companies are building on it, you might get to the bitcoin point where now bitcoin is money, and you don't need to have some number of dollars worth of bitcoin.
00:30:25.310 - 00:30:40.604, Speaker G: You can have bitcoin. And everyone sure agrees that's basically money. And you might get to that point for other crypto assets over time to the extent that more of the world's ecosystem moves on chain.
00:30:43.824 - 00:31:29.378, Speaker F: I guess this is why I still think these ecosystems grow really well when they focus around validator financing needs. And so minor financing was sort of the necessity as the mother of all innovation for derivatives trading and for a lot of kind of building up the early bitcoin financial industry. And stakers just haven't seemed to care that much yet. And like, you know, I agree someone needs a bank account, but hopefully the bank account is the validator who needs to, like, convert their souls into dollars somehow or like, borrow against their future souls. Like they're. They expect to earn a million souls the next year. They want to go buy some more capital to buying more souls because they're effectively letting verge long.
00:31:29.378 - 00:31:56.904, Speaker F: They somehow need to go borrow against their souls, right? And like, that whole circular ecosystem, money velocity, growth needs to somehow be there. And I think there are a lot of interesting solutions I've seen of like, borrowing stable coins against your staked assets that are staking derivatives that might actually, like, you know, shrink the time window that it takes to go from, like, new asset to like, there's a whole money velocity lending and trading ecosystem around it.
00:31:58.804 - 00:33:05.214, Speaker B: So, like, the point you bring up was kind of like leading to my next question was that like in proof of work there was like a clear need to spend a lot of money for miners to buy more hardware in proof of stake, we don't kind of have that need, right. Like validators set up one box and it gets cheaper every year to run it, right. It doesn't even, it doesn't even get more expensive and there isn't a lot of points setting up ten boxes despite of what people like, trying to pump up full node numbers mean. Like, I think like in governance there isn't like there's some point to having some amount of participants in governance, but like is there like limits to the size of like the governance body that you see in Defi protocols? Like, do you guys like, like what is like the benefit of getting, you know, hundred, like ten x more governance participants? Is there any, or is it like, is more always better? Or is there like a point where you kind of see diminishing returns and.
00:33:05.334 - 00:33:42.574, Speaker C: Does that mean engaged governance participants? Because I think that's like a big part of the question and a big part of the problem with governance today where like, I think I, you know, I personally hold governance tokens for several projects and my level of passion, dedication, prioritization of each of those projects is, it differs. I cannot give 100% as a governance participant to all of them. That just popped up when you said that. For me.
00:33:46.014 - 00:35:17.456, Speaker E: I think kind of like governance is somehow like security and somehow it might be like quantity as well, but also it depends on what kind of like governance in terms of like, you know, who are participating in your system and what are their kind of like incentives and how they're aligned towards what you're doing. But somehow I think with this like a proof of stake systems and where you have staking involved, it could be even on the network level where, for example, in our, we have. I think it's kind of like economics because I think you can be like passively participating and leave the decision making actively just to someone else with delegation or somehow to the extent when things are working well. And basically I come from Finland, which is a small country in the Nordics, and people don't vote much because things are working very well. But I think if working very well, what will happen is that people could vote, but it's not a clear case. There are countries where things are not working and you don't, you don't want to vote either. But the kind of point is that I think we might go to a direction where it starts to look more like a corporate governance in the sense that the underlying protocols are very economical.
00:35:17.456 - 00:35:37.672, Speaker E: If you're speaking of DeFi, if you're speaking Defi, these are practically banks running on chain. I mean, highly likely they will be governed a bit like businesses, but more in community oriented wide, you know, I.
00:35:37.688 - 00:36:48.570, Speaker D: Guess so far we had quite an interesting experience of curve being governed by like non corporate way. Well, it was basically, it was trying to find old whales and ask them to basically vote with regards to one or other proposal. And the hardest thing is of course getting the quorum. So we had like that threshold, we have threshold of 30% and we've been usually getting this threshold, but it was pretty hard with, let's say, when the company was having, let's say 4% or 5% of voting power. So the rest 25% is apparently pretty hard to get. And yeah, it worked. But I think what probably would make sense to do if, let's say, if not go the corporate way, right? That's possible, I think.
00:36:48.570 - 00:37:27.894, Speaker D: But I think it needs, well, first it probably needs some needs delegation maybe. And I think the best, the most interesting one would be liquid democracy where you, let's say, delegate your vote to someone. So when someone votes, if you don't vote, then the vote of that someone else is used. But if that guy doesn't vote, then the one who he delegates to is used as a vote and so on. So you could have this kind of structure of votes. And Twitter.
00:37:28.054 - 00:37:33.434, Speaker B: If I follow you and you follow Tarun and Tarun gets all the votes.
00:37:34.174 - 00:38:09.176, Speaker D: Yeah, pretty much. But, well, unless you decide to vote, then it's you who vote for Tarun. And in the five vote it's like, yeah, so you kind of can override this kind of back off. But if you don't vote, then the default choice is used, if there is any choice at all. And that's kind of, I don't know how it works in practice. I don't think anyone implemented fully working liquid democracy on chain.
00:38:09.360 - 00:38:19.852, Speaker F: Definitely that's their number one marketing point. Yeah. Okay. It's in their code base. I haven't voted, so I don't.
00:38:19.908 - 00:38:20.268, Speaker G: Perfect.
00:38:20.316 - 00:38:22.104, Speaker D: Should be ported to Ethereum.
00:38:25.244 - 00:39:33.198, Speaker B: I think I've always kind of thought that one of the most interesting things to come out of Defi was this governance, like kind of making daos, like version two, like fix a lot of stuff and kind of have it do something. Like, I think it's been like a really cool to see like how people have taken those approaches and have plugged them into protocols that do something. But I still think that, like, the social networking side of it, like, actually building a community is under appreciated right now. Like, do you guys think that these networks can grow to like 100 million people all in the same kind of like protocol, in the same defi, like eco, like in the same defi coin? Do you guys foresee, like, you know, like, Solana can handle 100 million participants to vote? Like, do you think that we can get 100 million people to go all by the same coin outside of bitcoin for non speculative reasons? Go ahead, Sam.
00:39:33.326 - 00:40:28.704, Speaker G: Yeah, I think one thing I'd say is that you can't make something out of nothing with this. I think it serve applies to governance and participation in staking and rewards and staking derivatives and everything like that. They're important scales with how much people would otherwise care about whats going on. I think were sort of past the point where you can just create that skeleton and be like, hey guys, weve got staking and yield and governance and staking derivatives. Its all this one coin we just made up, go do it. And then people are like, great, were going to go do it. Lets see how many people need to govern the inflation of this coin with no protocol, but that if you do have something that people are otherwise starting to use, you can really amplify it with all of these things.
00:40:28.704 - 00:41:29.472, Speaker G: And you can start to get a lot of adoption of the governance and everything else if there's a lot of adoption of the underlying protocol. And I think that one thing that sort of ties together a lot of the, well, I think everyone on this call was a token, is that there's something other than the token going on in the protocol. And so I think it's one thing to say, like, well, how about, like, can you get a bunch of people to, you know, participate in Aave governance? And the answer is maybe. I mean, I think step one is getting a ton of people to use Aave and to be borrowing and lending with it, not for yield or rewards or for governance or staking derivatives, but because they have one asset and they want to borrow a different one instead. And then once you have that as a baseline, you have a lot of people who are invested, and then you have a lot of people who have nothing to do with Aave but start getting involved in the governance because they see all these other people who are using the protocol. And so it's like something to govern. And then you can start to, like, really exponentially grow all of the structure around it.
00:41:29.472 - 00:41:50.144, Speaker G: I think the same is true balance and of curve. Like those are actual protocols that people use. And so I think like, you know, I do think these things can be super powerful, but I also think it's like important not to put the cart before the horse here and to like first have a thing worth governing and then try and govern it.
00:41:51.924 - 00:42:32.604, Speaker D: Right. Well, and also I guess getting back to the like participation rate in governance, it's probably, it is higher when the votes are contentious. Like if everyone agrees with something, obviously, or everyone disagrees. People don't even vote much. And I guess that's where delegates would be actually great. But when something is contentious. So imagine, I don't know, Avi governance voting with regards to, I don't know, raising borrow rate by factor of five and as well as the supply rate.
00:42:32.604 - 00:42:51.404, Speaker D: So borrowers are kind of totally against that, suppliers are totally for that and they are kind of fighting each other or something. Well I don't know if it's a good example, but yeah, so I guess that's, that's, that's where like the people's vote matters most.
00:42:52.584 - 00:44:14.246, Speaker E: And I have to agree with Michael on this, that people may be stressed too much about the, you know, like how many votes are showing up, you know, like, and I think some of the project might stress it out also because, you know, you kind of want to know or understand like what kind of mandate, like how extended mandates you need to actually pass a decision because let's say if you have a big change in the protocol, is it sufficient that you pass it, let's say with, with half a percent or percent forum or let's say four and all this kind of like things, you know, and some of the protocols, they have very high the quorum or devoting threshold. And I think it's just kind of like as Michael said, that if there's something super controversial, people will show up and there's campaigning. But if it's something like, let's say, could be in avid just changing the collateral factor by you know, 5% or liquidation incentives, there's some things that probably like not many will come, you know, but the controversial stuff, that's, that's a different story. And people probably will fight, fight for this one.
00:44:14.310 - 00:44:14.590, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:44:14.622 - 00:45:19.250, Speaker F: One thing about that I think that maybe sometimes needs to be thought of before building these things is sort of what you mean by like fast governance and slow governance, like changing a collateral factor because liquidators can't liquidate because there is a market crash. That's like a fast vote. Right. That's not like something that you want, you even need to really go through like the two week process of like, hey, we want to redistribute tokens to certain people because that's like a very qualitative judgment call type of vote. So I think, I think in some ways, like, yeah, liquid democracy is one of these angles that tries to like, not force the users to have to think about this. But yeah, there is definitely a bit of cart before the horse. And it is kind of sad in some ways to see a lot of the stuff that was invented in 2017 and 2016 kind of be completely useless for proof of stake because no one in proof of stake ever wants to make any decisions.
00:45:19.250 - 00:45:24.954, Speaker F: Everyone's super conservative and DeFi is the only place that like, all of that research is getting applied.
00:45:29.934 - 00:45:55.734, Speaker B: In that sense. Like, there was a kind of one of the top questions about flash loads and those kinds of attacks. Do you think that people are going to, like, how far away are we from like, governance attack vectors? Or like people try to game a particular protocol to cause something to happen for their own benefit? Are you guys already seeing this?
00:45:56.634 - 00:46:59.158, Speaker E: We have a lot of discussion on this. I think there is actually, this is a kind of like a point because I think it was like 50,000 MkR, or if I correctly remember that you need to actually activate the, what do you call it, like emergency shutdown in the makerdao system. And also kind of like this borrowing for voting. It's a big question now, especially if you can vote in the future, let's say with a tokens or c tokens and whatnot, it becomes very challenging. But the question also is for me that, let's say borrowing assets to affect into the governance in, let's say good governance that has been seen in corporate governance. I mean, as a kind of like a not, not so good practice in that sense. But there's many ways to mitigate various things.
00:46:59.158 - 00:48:14.074, Speaker E: But here in, on chain ecosystem practically there is less. So you need to design systems pretty damn well that kind of like you mitigate governance attacks. But the issue, of course, is that we never know how big this opportunity is. So let's say, if you have to lock your tokens to vote, kind of like for how long a period, you're able to take that locking risk by borrowing a lot of assets and making a bigger kind of a profit from that. And I think there isn't clear, you know, like yes or no, what I've been following in the Aave governance forum. It's pretty much like there's sort of kind of like arguments that governance tokens shouldn't be borrowed, but then again, like their assets as any assets and, you know, comparable to shares and why not? So it's really difficult to, and I think what works very well in DeFi is being conservative, especially times like this. And this is practically the reason that every governance token we have listed in AAvE has been practically without the capability of borrowing at the moment.
00:48:16.254 - 00:49:40.326, Speaker D: Yeah, well, I guess. Well, it's probably better to include the protections on the protocol, which uses a governance to token itself. Like if you can take your token vote and leave, that's probably pretty bad because you could manipulate, but even if not, like for example on curvyou, we kind of lock tokens. So there you really commit for a long time and that's good. But I, I can quite see that some, for some protocols, it is possible to even, let's say if you look for some, like if you look for a protocol where, which struggles to get a quorum, and the quorum kind of the quorum requirement is low at the same time with low market cap, then it could be cheap enough to just buy tokens, do something bad and forget about those tokens. So even if you didn't borrow them, even if you bought them, it could be like enough of an incentive. Well, the good thing is that all the voting takes time.
00:49:40.326 - 00:50:54.518, Speaker D: So if there is a malicious vote, it will be visible that it's malicious and people who use the protocol will have time to leave. But basically, I guess the vulnerability here is not so much making an exploit for money, but more like making an exploit like having users of the protocol to either leave or be vulnerable. And obviously racial users will leave and this will destroy the protocol. So that's kind of what the governance attacks open you up to. And I guess another mitigation of the attacks is not allowing to change the code of the protocol arbitrarily by governance. I don't think governance is ready for arbitrary code changes. Of course, when you have the company and the team owning like all their governance, all the governance tokens, then it doesn't, it doesn't really, it's not distinguished from the company owning that protocol.
00:50:54.518 - 00:51:23.434, Speaker D: And then of course they can change the code, but then it's kind of, it's also not, well, not very, not very safe. Like you really need to trust that company to do that. But when the protocol is truly decentralized, then you are kind of open to all these sorts of governance attacks. And if you can do arbitrary code changes with all the state which holds the money, then I guess I wouldn't be comfortable with that.
00:51:25.334 - 00:51:58.554, Speaker C: So it sounds like this. I mean, I think a lot of what's been said is sort of potentially in support of the case for crypto projects really taking their time, it differs from project to project, but really taking their time before, like, making that step to full decentralization because of all of the unknown unknowns and how early we are in decentralized governance right now. I think for some projects, it can make sense, of course, to be feature complete and go fully decentralized from day one. But I think for other projects.
00:52:00.874 - 00:52:01.258, Speaker E: It.
00:52:01.306 - 00:52:08.894, Speaker C: Probably makes a lot of sense to really take time and treat that as an incremental process.
00:52:09.474 - 00:52:34.584, Speaker D: Yeah. Or it's possible to solve it by simply the token distribution. So let's say initial tokens are held by the project. I don't know, investors, whatever. And then the project is centralized at the beginning, although governed by tokens, but then it's gradually transitioned into decentralization by just the way of. The way of token distribution.
00:52:36.524 - 00:53:13.134, Speaker B: Yeah. So we're almost like, we have five minutes left. I kind of wanted to ask you guys, like, you know, what does this look like five years from now? Like, what are we working towards? Like, like, five years is like infinity in crypto, right? Like, you know, what do you guys think will actually change? Like, by, by this? I have a hard time thinking beyond six, six weeks from now, because that's kind of effectively one sprint. So beyond that, it's like a black hole. Like anything could happen.
00:53:15.114 - 00:53:27.324, Speaker D: Most traditional banks being obsolete, most of world finance running on chain with this space. That's. That's not impossible. Well, I would say ten years, though.
00:53:28.984 - 00:53:37.884, Speaker B: Like, what, what does that mean? Do I actually, like, do I have an ATM card that spits out dollars that's connected to, like, aave or, like.
00:53:39.424 - 00:54:01.904, Speaker D: Well, I mean. Well, I guess most probably. Most probably you can interact with Avi or curve directly, or you can go to your traditional bank, which will do nothing else than interacting with Ivy or curve or balancer, and it will be just banks will be front faces to Defi.
00:54:03.724 - 00:54:50.548, Speaker E: Yeah. I'd also, like, shared the vision that practically, you know, this is so unstoppable, and it's already too obvious. So it's very difficult to, you know, put the reverse gear on this technology and basically create something more controllable and less efficient. And I think the only way to kind of, like, for the traditional finance to, you know, keep up with this is practically join the ecosystem one way or another. And provide the access. And the thing is, Michael also pointed out that what they have is the brands and user bases that they can connect. And probably they will become the front end DeFi shop for the DeFi protocols.
00:54:50.548 - 00:55:37.374, Speaker E: And one thing I can predict that if this happens, these DeFi protocols and all of these networks that are now, they might become substantially large. And not just by the extent that they are kind of like eating whatever is out there, you know, but because it's so efficient, and it's so efficient to build things that we never have seen anything like this before. Anyone can just, you know, just deploy code from any part of the world and create the next, you know, curve or aave and whatnot. And this is like the beauty, you know, you can create very specialized products that will be accessible for wide demographic.
00:55:39.434 - 00:56:06.404, Speaker D: I guess I can also tell a pretty dark perspective, which anatoly will like. And this is that in five years, one transaction on Ethereum will cost $100,000 and only banks will be able to transact on DeFi. So they will introduce KYC and everything.
00:56:09.224 - 00:57:03.602, Speaker F: So I mean, but to be fair, validators identities are known. So it's not already a form of KYC improve, but they don't have to be. I mean they're still registering to the network and I can measure their, I can measure latency to their bots, but I think maybe I'll take a different tactical. I think everyone else wants to have the strike version Defi narrative, which I think is definitely, that's the most appealing one. But I'm personally more interested in the privacy improvements over the next five years. I really think those are quite key to actually getting Defi in the hands of more traditional investors. And right now, thanks to the Moore's law that we're having in hardware, there's no more Moore's law.
00:57:03.602 - 00:57:43.314, Speaker F: We're done. Scaling's over, go home. But in zero knowledge proof land, the Moore's law is actually quite amazing right now. And I think it's quite hard to see if you're not really at the conferences, reading papers, looking at the performance numbers and stuff like that. But since the first sort of CK snark paper in 2012, we're about 1 trillion times larger in terms of the compute capacity we can handle and approve. And I think generating private DeFi primitives is the, is the future to really getting to this hundred million voter world.
00:57:50.624 - 00:58:36.688, Speaker G: And I think scaling is just super important. I think in any world that really matters, scaling matters way more than it gets credit for. I think people often think of scaling as needing to get another factor of 100 so that like amms on Ethereum are useful with current adoption, that's with a thousand users. If you want a billion users, you need another three orders of magnitude. And if you want to have something that has like powerful applications, you're going to need another two above that. And so I think, like, realistically speaking, you know, in order for DeFi to really get huge, you need a factor of a million above Ethereum in terms of throughput. And I think it's just like, I wouldn't quite say worth dismissing out of hand any chain that doesn't have a roadmap to get there.
00:58:36.688 - 00:59:34.410, Speaker G: But I actually do like legitimately believe sort of a weaker version of that. As far as the potential for it to become huge. Now, a chain or an ecosystem can absolutely have the potential to become moderately sized without that. If your goal is to have defi be a hundred billion dollar sector that doesn't need a factor of a million, that needs a factor of 1000 or something, and that would still be pretty cool, you know, that that would be a lot more than we have now. And like that, that's starting to approach bitcoin levels or, you know, current bitcoin levels. Um, but if you're thinking that it's going to be a lot bigger than that, like, you know, just need to keep adding orders of magnitude and like, it's not like you need infinity. Like you, there's sort of like, you know, how many people there in the world, like, you know how much, you know how much data the Internet consumes, you know, how much data, you know, NAsdaq traces, like, you can sort of like ballpark these numbers.
00:59:34.410 - 00:59:52.030, Speaker G: Um, I think that's just like incredibly important. And that like, people underestimate how much we need more than just a bit more throughput in order to really scale. And again, we don't need it all tomorrow, we need it all in ten years. But like, I, you know, you better have a roadmap for getting there in ten years, and you better have a lot more than we have now.
00:59:52.062 - 01:00:36.884, Speaker F: Tomorrow, I want to add one other thing, which is that in my mind, the only way to actually scale in the long run is a lot of new cryptographic primitives. The compression from a lot of the user knowledge proof schemes, as well as the level of interactivity going down, means that you're getting much closer to bitcoin like experiences on smart contracts in five to ten years with proof sizes that are 256 bytes or 1024 bytes. So that, that, that's kind of. That's the way you get to a million times scaling. I don't think it's coming from like hardware, you know? Sorry.
01:00:37.544 - 01:00:39.284, Speaker B: We'll, we'll see.
01:00:39.944 - 01:00:45.644, Speaker G: Yeah, I don't know. You can get like a surprising number of orders of magnitude right now if you really try.
01:00:46.224 - 01:00:46.648, Speaker B: Yep.
01:00:46.696 - 01:00:47.552, Speaker G: I don't know if it's surprising, but.
01:00:47.568 - 01:00:48.592, Speaker F: You need a better.
01:00:48.648 - 01:00:51.600, Speaker D: To combine everything and that's where you get it very.
01:00:51.672 - 01:01:03.260, Speaker B: There's a lot of, there's a lot of sand to organize. Surprising amount of sand. What do you think, Jeremy?
01:01:03.412 - 01:01:39.624, Speaker C: Yeah, I would throw in maybe like a macro perspective, more zoomed out, where I think that building in the space will continue continuously grow, maybe in a more linear fashion, whereas adoption and entry into the market or into the ecosystem of new entrants will kind of continue to follow sort of a cyclical pattern where, you know, it experiences periods of booms and periods of slow slowing down. And those cycles might kind of continue to tighten in terms of like, the frequency and the length of those cycles.
01:01:44.324 - 01:02:04.804, Speaker B: I kind of tend to agree with all of you guys, even Tarun, in terms of like, what the future holds. Just in terms of my opinions on scaling or something like that, is like somebody really smart told me to do all the cryptography at the last possible moment because the research there basically changes every two months.
01:02:06.744 - 01:02:16.164, Speaker F: It's like hardware in the eighties, right? It's like people didn't get ten years, they weren't studying the right hardware. That was doubling every 18 months.
01:02:17.104 - 01:03:01.484, Speaker B: Yeah. So that like, I kind of think that that's just kind of part of the, how the system, how the general ecosystem matures. I would say that, like, what I'm excited about is kind of breaking out of the box a little bit. Like having more users than just like metamask users in the space. And not, not like that. There's like another version of matter mask with its own, like just. My mom asked me about bitcoin, not because I'm working on a crypto startup, but because the amount of like airdrops the federal government in the US is giving her, like, is scaring her because she remind, it reminds her of the Soviet Union.
01:03:01.484 - 01:03:55.210, Speaker B: Like that, that's what freaked her out. And like, those kinds of users are like, out there. And I think that's just kind of like the base kind of fear approach, but there's opportunities outside of store value, which is, I think, the simplest version of Defi. Like, I have a savings account to get people in and get them to understand that there's less fees, like, less middlemen trying to screw you, and kind of more open and transparent systems that are not trying to scam every month $12 in your account for some random reason or something like that. That, to me, I think, is like, like, the more exciting part is, like, getting people to understand that there's, like, a difference. Once they understand it, then they can. They will, like, jump over hoops to learn, you know, how to deal with key pairs.
01:03:55.210 - 01:04:00.010, Speaker B: It's not that hard, right? They just have to have, like, a need, like a need to do it.
01:04:00.202 - 01:04:34.654, Speaker C: So I think also the size of the Jups, the hoops that they would need to jump through will continue to shrink. I think, like, the UX needs to continue to improve. And of course, it's sort of basic foundational things like throughput and fees, you know, those things coming into the right place to essentially create, like, a very comfortable bridge from, you know, CFI into Defi, where it actually doesn't feel like you're crossing a bridge that much. I think. I think that's an important thing that'll happen.
01:04:38.554 - 01:05:02.704, Speaker B: Cool. Well, I think we're, like, basically over time, unless you guys want to hang out, but I'm sure you're all busy to have companies to run or three companies to run and tons of other stuff to do. It's been really awesome to talk to you folks. I hope in five years we get a chance to grab a beer together somewhere.
01:05:04.364 - 01:05:04.988, Speaker E: I hope so.
01:05:05.036 - 01:05:06.264, Speaker G: Yeah, definitely.
01:05:10.044 - 01:05:11.124, Speaker B: Cool, right?
