00:07:17.985 - 00:07:57.305, Speaker B: What's up, Solana fam? Are you not entertained? How's everyone doing today? I'm James, the co founder and CEO of Jambo. So I told my team, I know most of y'all are either jetlag or you trying to go to F1. So I hope we got your attention real quick. For five minutes, Jambo is the most distributed web3 mobile or emerging markets and in the entire world. We started shipping. Since January of this year, we've done 500,000 phones, created over 2 million wallets in 128 countries Appreciate y'all. Now I see a lot of familiar faces in the crowd.
00:07:57.305 - 00:08:23.625, Speaker B: My name is James, but for those that don't know me, I'm ethnically Chinese. I grew up in Africa, 16 years of my life. And that is where our supply chain is in China. And the reason we started Jambo is for three reasons. When you grow up in a country like Congo, you have things like cross border payments, remittances, banking, the unbanked. You cannot access your friends very close to you. Even so that is what we are here to do.
00:08:23.625 - 00:08:42.535, Speaker B: We want to bridge that gap using Web3 mobile technology. So honestly, we want to give a big shout out to the entire Solana fam for having us here and you guys for supporting us. Now I know you guys have been here in all kinds of talks all day, so I'm going to just keep it short for you. And please allow me to show you how we got here today. Thank you.
00:08:48.875 - 00:08:52.735, Speaker A: Who makes the loudest noise will get the drummer.
00:09:58.665 - 00:09:59.405, Speaker B: Sa.
00:10:24.325 - 00:10:25.065, Speaker A: Sa.
00:11:00.175 - 00:11:40.417, Speaker B: Awesome. Oh, y'all thought that was over? Nah, you got a little more seconds of me right here. It is my absolute honor to present the Jambo V2 here at Solana Breakpoint 2024. The Jambo V2 $99 exact same price for double the specs. Shipping to 128 countries and including one of the most important features, Jumbo GPT. As you know, ChatGPT and OpenAI has changed all of our lives. But a lot of places, emerging markets, for example, our largest market, Sao Paulo, Brazil, Argentina, Thailand, et cetera, you might not have access to as a 19 year old kid there.
00:11:40.417 - 00:12:30.213, Speaker B: So now through Jambo GPT you can access it through crypto and live feed. You can not only directly do actions inside of Jambo GPT in the phone, in the future you will be able to directly direct your wallet, your Jumbo wallet pre installed in the phone to do certain actions through it. Now Jumbo V2 starts shipping in exactly one month. We have a QR code over here. Not to do a cliche, but right now if you scan this code and you order it, you will have the Jambo GPT and the Jambo V2 at your home within two months. Last part. It is our absolute honor, absolute honor to share with you because you're not here to hear me talk for the entire time.
00:12:30.213 - 00:13:02.281, Speaker B: You're here to know exactly how this pertains to you. Our largest partner at the moment for integrating into the phone that might have something to do with your wallet balance, Mr. Bonk we will be having some drops of air of the bonk into our phone within the next few months. So please, last but not least, shout out to everyone here, Lily, Toli, everyone on stage. Ellie, that got us over here. We are absolutely proud and thank you for supporting us even till right now.
