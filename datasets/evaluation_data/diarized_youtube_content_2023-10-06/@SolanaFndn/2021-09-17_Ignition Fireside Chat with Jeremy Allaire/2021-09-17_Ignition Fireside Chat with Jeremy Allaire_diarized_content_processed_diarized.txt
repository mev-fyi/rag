00:00:19.360 - 00:00:28.700, Speaker A: Hey, folks, this is Anatoly. Awesome for you to join me and Jeremy Allaire for the ignition hackathon. And super exciting to have you here. Jeremy.
00:00:28.892 - 00:00:33.188, Speaker B: Thanks, man. Great to be here. It was nice to see you earlier this week.
00:00:33.316 - 00:00:52.224, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, likewise. Yeah. So USDC, I think, is in my mind, like, has been on the rocket ship ride over the last year. I think it's been pretty obvious to everyone else as well. So what's happening? Why is USDC growing so fast?
00:00:53.314 - 00:02:25.990, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, look, I think basically all of the mega trends in crypto and the growth in those USDC is super indexed to all this. So when you look at the September of 2018, we made a really big priority to kind of work with Defi projects. And as you know, DeFi was pretty nascent back then. But there are a lot of projects that we know and love today were absolutely getting off the ground then and during the crypto winter in 2019, we just put a lot of energy behind trying to work with projects that were getting started, trying to work with this new wave of wallets that could support DeFi. I think last year, the outgrowth of crypto market growth was this incredible growth in the readiness and capabilities of DeFi protocols, which has been a huge piece. If you look at TVL and you look at it across whatever, whether it's on Solana or on Ethereum or whatnot, USDC is a really, really widely valued, accepted, both form of collateral as well as for providing liquidity and as well as something people want to borrow and all this kind of stuff.
00:02:25.990 - 00:03:16.142, Speaker B: And so that's been significant. I think the third piece, which is the one that I think we're really, really excited about, is we've just continued to see more and more, both people and businesses that just want to stay natively in stablecoin and transactional in it as a medium of exchange and who want to use it as a payment method. And so we have like a record number of businesses that are just signing up for circle services who are, they're basically saying, I am going to use this as a payment system. And that's really powerful. And I think about these are network effect businesses. And basically, the more people who have USDC, the more valuable the network is of users. And so it of creates that usage growth.
00:03:16.142 - 00:03:23.874, Speaker B: But we're still really in the early days of generalized payment activity happening with it.
00:03:26.014 - 00:03:51.464, Speaker A: The growth right now seems to be lagging TVL growth. DeFi protocols launch and their tvls go up, and USC kind of follows this collateral? Do you think that's because traders are just looking for stable pairs when they're trading in? Or is it because the protocols themselves need stable coins as part of their collateral base?
00:03:52.364 - 00:04:37.144, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's both, right. I think having stables in the pairs is really, really key. I think this is depending on what the protocol is trying to do. If there's price discovery and, or if it's obviously, if people are borrowing stables and so on, like, it's really intrinsic. Obviously some of these swap protocols are kind of agnostic about what it is that you're providing liquidity around, but it just tends to be that the pairs that have USDC are always, like, right near the top. Very near the top as well. It makes sense.
00:04:37.144 - 00:04:41.264, Speaker B: I don't think there's too many surprises there.
00:04:41.724 - 00:05:15.154, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think a lot of times you see the native token, like Solereth, as being part of the major trading pairs or collateral base. And it was surprising to me that stable coins, like dollar, I guess, both not surprising and surprising that those would be basically usually like 50% of the other, the other side of it, too. Do you think there's like an interplay between the native layer, one coin and the stable that is issued on top of it? Are they like kind of married?
00:05:15.654 - 00:05:55.956, Speaker B: Well, I mean, in a sense. Right. If, like, you know, those are like the, you know, when I think about someone who's going to enter into the Solana ecosystem, right. And you get your first, you know, Solana wallet, and, like, what are the two things that you want to have? First, you want to have Solana and you want to have USDC. And so maybe you go somewhere and you buy some Solana and then you put it in your wallet and then you move some USDC over, and that's sort of like the most base layer. You need, like the native, you know, you need the native token and you need some USDC, and then you can kind of get everything else going from that, for sure. Yeah, yeah.
00:05:56.150 - 00:06:07.164, Speaker A: So, I mean, in theory, this is like, potentially a future without centralized exchanges, right, that you have enough USDC on the layer one that's totally native and you just need ramps in and out.
00:06:08.624 - 00:07:26.748, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, just generally, like that concept of how can we have more and more economic activity just be natively on chain, right. Not having to leave being on chain, whether it's exchange activity or payment activity or savings and lending activity, or whether it's a verb of finance or a verb of commerce or whatever that is, being able to stay native is super valuable to everyone in the ecosystem, but then to users as well. Obviously optimistic about that continuing. Yeah. But having, like, we've built USDC very much on the premise that having really, really robust interoperability with the existing financial system is really, really important. Because, as I like to say, right, you've got $120 trillion of commercial bank m two money. So that's most of the electronic money in the world, or that is basically all the electronic money in the world.
00:07:26.748 - 00:07:59.244, Speaker B: And you got 125 billion in dollar stablecoins. And so there's still a huge need for that interoperability. It's sort of like Netflix was originally a DVD by mail, and then when streaming came, it was really, really limited. You still needed your cable subscription or you still needed your blockbuster, whatever it was. We're still pretty early in terms of substitute goods and stuff, but obviously it's growing.
00:08:00.584 - 00:08:10.044, Speaker A: Yeah, that's also exciting to me. How many users or humans do you estimate use USDC on chain?
00:08:11.344 - 00:09:10.864, Speaker B: It's really hard to estimate. I think the best guesses just come from basically trying to aggregate the number of people who have exchange accounts and the number of installs there are on various wallet apps and stuff like that. Because probably if you're using, whether it be a coinbase or a binance or an FTX, you're probably using USDC in some way. And if you're using a wallet, a mobile wallet, you're probably using USDC in some way. It's not going to be 100%, but it's going to be common. And so when you look at those, I think the best estimates are probably, when you look around the world, it's probably like 30 to 50 million somewhere in there. I think that's probably a reasonable estimate right now, and that's pretty good.
00:09:10.864 - 00:09:39.712, Speaker B: But when you zoom out, that's still really small. I mean, like cash app in the United States, which is only available in the United States, has 50 million monthly active users. That's monthly actives. Right. How many people have ever opened it? Right. So, and whatever PayPal has, whatever it is, 250 million. I don't know if they're monthly active, but accounts opened and then obviously, like, Facebook has a lot, but so there's huge room to grow.
00:09:39.712 - 00:10:53.534, Speaker B: Right. And I think that's one of the things that we're really focused on is how to light up more digital wallets with this. And I think, obviously, we've talked a lot about this, but one of the things that we're really excited about with chains like Solana is it really fulfills the promise of what we set out to do eight years ago when we started circle, which is we believe that it would become possible to have a protocol for dollars on the Internet that you'd be able to transact over the open Internet with anyone at the speed of the Internet, basically for free. And it's taken a long time to actually be able to realize that. But I literally feel like in the last six to twelve months, as things like USDC and Solana have come online, we can actually do it, we can actually deliver this. And so it's one of the most exciting things for me is it's taken eight years to get to, getting to the very first thing that we thought would become possible when we started the company. But the implications are really profound.
00:10:53.534 - 00:12:07.660, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I think one of the things, and it's relevant to ignition and the hackathon and everything that's going on, is we really want to see people who are innovating at the user experience level of payment user experiences, because, like you, someone can build incredible payment user experiences, whether it's on the peer to peer side, or on the person to merchant side or on the business side. All these different use cases, I think there's a lot of focus on trading and markets and capital market primitives, which is huge and so on. But, like, as this moves into the mainstream of commercial activity on the Internet, like, it goes way outside of just people who care about markets and trading, it goes into everyday people and everyday businesses who are saying, like, this is a better way for me to operate commercially, this is a better way for me to operate on the Internet. And so we're really, really supportive of projects that are advancing in that space. And a lot of this can happen just with software. You don't have to have, you don't have to be a regulated e money company or whatever to do some of these things, or a payments company. I think that's one of the things that's out there.
00:12:07.660 - 00:12:13.304, Speaker B: And so, anyway, hoping to see some cool stuff out of ignition on that.
00:12:13.644 - 00:12:35.004, Speaker A: Yeah, likewise. Kind of the question to the users, when you said 50 million maybe, is the top estimate, how many of those do you think are you, like, a lot of folks move back and forth, but how many do you think have never like or like, what is the percentage of them that actually use the blockchain?
00:12:36.104 - 00:13:34.824, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think when I look at certainly other stable coins, there's a couple of things that we know. We know that because of USDC's role in DeFi as the largest dollar stablecoin used in DeFi, it has far more end user wallets than other things. We've seen that from on chain analytics, it's more dispersed, there's more disbursement into individual wallets. That's good. I think end users have figured out how to do that. But in terms of actual numbers in there, I think it's probably a good bit smaller than 30 to 50 million. It's probably, I would guess it's probably more like in the 10 million or something like that.
00:13:36.204 - 00:13:53.204, Speaker A: The founders that are thinking about global pay or payments using USDC, do you expect them to think of crypto as their market? Or like, should they just be, I'm going to build the next venmo. It's going to have a billion users and crypto is just a tool.
00:13:53.944 - 00:15:07.640, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I do think it's crypto, right. Because if you're thinking about how to solve problems, it's not just like there's a point to point transaction settlement mechanism, right. That's in, that's interesting, right. But what makes, what makes stable coins like USDC so interesting is that they exist in the context of a virtual machine where you can write code and you can do things with it. And that's what makes it interesting. A more efficient transaction processing model for a single asset is interesting. You do it at scale, you can do it cheaply, but it's much more interesting to say, okay, how do I build an invoicing protocol that's got invoice factoring built into it, or that can use oracleized data to then hook up to defi to get lines of credit against an invoice and have that tied into wholesale payment flow? I'm just using one example, I'm just throwing something out there to make a point, which is that the building blocks of payment activity, whether it's me buying the proverbial cup of coffee or business payments, are actually dramatically larger.
00:15:07.640 - 00:16:31.750, Speaker B: Visa throws around this number, which is that there's something like $120 trillion a year in business payments that are made using checks, physical checks and bank wires. And so, okay, there's a lot. What is the context for those payments and what could you do with smart contracts to improve that? And when I think about, like, so it's crypto innovation, right? So what kind of protocols can people build that have to do with loyalty and incentive programs? Like loyalty and incentive programs are such an intrinsic part of consumer payment experiences. NFTs have demonstrated that you can build distinct tokens that represent something to someone and can have even a visual representation, et cetera. And so the combination of nfts and stablecoins and smart contracts kind of gives you the building blocks to reimagine loyalty models, incentive models, and payment models that are tied together. And all of that has historically been these completely closed loop, completely proprietary, network specific things. That's a place for protocol innovation and the composability that we think about with DeFi, where you've got these kind of primitives that are composable with each other for financial markets, you think about the composability around payments use cases.
00:16:31.750 - 00:17:23.672, Speaker B: You could have like a loyalty point protocol. You could have a loyalty and rewards kind of thing. You could have an insurance protocol, which is like a chargeback insurance protocol. You could have time locked escrow and refund protocols. But all these kinds of things could be developed and be kind of usable with each other, and you don't have to stuff it all into one thing. And so I'm really interested to see that kind of work happening. And the ability to use tokens as incentive mechanisms, both for people who are involved in payments and businesses that are trying to build franchises of affinity tokens, becoming a hugely interesting part of that as well.
00:17:23.672 - 00:17:53.734, Speaker B: And so that whole space is just completely wide open right now. And it wasn't really possible to innovate in these areas until you had scalable layer ones, scalable and cost effective layer ones, because you'd never think of doing these things when instantiating all this kind of stuff cost you so much. And so I think we're actually at a, we're literally right now at a place where developers and entrepreneurs can start to work on some of these problem spaces.
00:17:58.314 - 00:18:03.654, Speaker A: How much, how cheap do you think? And how fast do you think a layer one needs to be?
00:18:10.274 - 00:18:11.254, Speaker B: For what?
00:18:11.674 - 00:18:13.410, Speaker A: For like global payments, right?
00:18:13.442 - 00:18:57.864, Speaker B: Like for global payments? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think that we're probably looking at needing for the actual on chain mechanism, needing to get into the hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. I think without a doubt, we're going to need to get into the hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. And in terms of cost, I think sort of keeping these things in the pennies and subpennies is pretty important, right? So I think if you're in those ballparks, then I think this can be extraordinary, right?
00:18:58.924 - 00:19:13.376, Speaker A: What about like state size? Like, do you feel like, you know, if we have a billion people, are they all going to just have one account or like a dozen each? What you guys see in patterns how.
00:19:13.400 - 00:20:32.318, Speaker B: People use this stuff I mean, like, it's sort of like the question about how many people are actually on chain with using SDC today, right? So you have custodial and non custodial. And so I think that the world will continue to bifurcate where the majority of people will be interacting with all of this through intermediaries, right? They'll be interacting, people who deal with security, who deal with identity, who deal with compliance or whatever those parameters are. There are going to be a lot of people who do that and who can do that at scale. And so they're going to be able to use a limited number of accounts and omnibus structures and off chain structures and everything else. So I think that's useful. But I think just the law of large numbers, the number who are directly operating on this is also going to grow really, really significantly. I think there's a really good argument to make that humans, people will want to know that they have a digital wallet, whether it's money and assets and identity and other things that they can fully control.
00:20:32.318 - 00:21:26.394, Speaker B: I think that will continue to grow. I think it's just part of the dialectic of the Internet is that the sweep of the dialectic is moving from hyper centralization to decentralization right now, and that will lead. And everyone is sort of aware of that. They're aware of how they're being watched basically by AI's and governments in some cases, but mostly by AI's. And there's just a sort of a feeling of loss of freedom. I think that the dialectic will have more and more people who are running at the edge of the network, so to speak, as well. And I think on a first principles basis, it's obviously really important that everything that gets built has the ability to operate that way.
00:21:27.574 - 00:21:38.774, Speaker A: So you think most people will prefer kind of like bespoke, centralized, or model where their keys are safe, but they want that rail to be able to exit.
00:21:39.634 - 00:22:12.458, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think so. I think so. I mean, it's sort of interesting because you watch this in other areas of the Internet, right, where you had, you know, how open is the cloud service that I use basically? Like, is my g drive, like, what can I, is g drive open? Can I, like. Yes, people can actually build plugins too. I can give them permission and stuff. People can interact with the actual file objects. But like, can I just get all my stuff? Is it portable? What does that look like? Most people are like, I don't know.
00:22:12.458 - 00:22:47.754, Speaker B: It's great because it's just there and I don't have to think about it. And now and then I get asked to upgrade to the five terabyte plan or whatever it is. But like, I think, but there is an awareness of sort of the openness and interoperability that's there for a lot of people. But like certain things like music and video went the opposite way. Like everyone thought, like everyone wants to control their own mp3 s, everyone wants to have their local music library. It was all about ownership of the items and having that. And then it just became too cumbersome and the distribution model was terrible.
00:22:47.754 - 00:23:34.444, Speaker B: And so the celestial jukebox model in the cloud, right. That just consumer preference was like, that's, I'd much rather do that. And so I think with, with money and property and identity and other things, it'll be interesting to see where, where kind of people come out. And it's obviously it's going to vary by, by, by community, it's going to vary by country, it's going to vary by historical circumstance as well. Like people who are very, very aware about like the state seizing their money or who are, you know, are worried about various forms of censorship or other things. Right. It's gonna, it's gonna, people are gonna adapt.
00:23:36.904 - 00:23:47.844, Speaker A: Man. I just had a vision of a Spotify for tokens. You're the tokens. You should be.
00:23:50.304 - 00:23:51.084, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:52.024 - 00:23:53.524, Speaker A: Infinite tokens.
00:23:54.424 - 00:24:03.964, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, exactly. Yeah. So it's interesting. I mean, I guess.
00:24:04.944 - 00:24:05.504, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:05.584 - 00:26:16.134, Speaker B: In terms of defi, I mean, it might be interesting to talk a little bit about DeFi because we talked a little bit about payments. And I think the, a big area that I think we're interested in watching is how do DeFi lending markets evolve from where they are principally today, which is either super, super tightly tied up in yield farming and trading and markets activity and or relatedly, just like margining activity and sort of these over collateralized or significantly collateralized models, which again, largely point to a kind of trading and markets use case to more general purpose mechanisms for capital formation and or capital allocation. I think when we were getting started founding circle, we got really excited about the concept of a long tail capital market where someone who's got a plot of land in a country and is trying to raise capital for it and or borrow capital to do something, could actually, because of the development of programmable money and smart contracts, they would actually be able to participate in a capital market that's on the open Internet, like an eBay of capital, and that you could get to that level of that. But that's not going to be someone who's coming in and posting their bitcoin or ETH as collateral, necessarily to borrow. But they're going to want to be able to have some way for the market to underwrite them and for there to be insurance on that, and for there to be a way for them to do that in a legal way. Right. So that, like, they're able to, like, do it in a compliant way where they have employees or whatever it is.
00:26:16.134 - 00:26:53.754, Speaker B: And I'm really interested to see what people do, you know, now that we're starting to get better oracle technology with, you know, kind of coming in play. And I think one of the missing pieces as well is ways for entities to identify themselves in different ways so that you actually have known entities, as opposed to just being based on cryptocollateral or crypto collateral reputation, and what people might be able to build with those kinds of things. I don't know if you've seen anything in those areas.
00:26:58.894 - 00:27:40.254, Speaker A: There's a few protocols that I'm excited about that are working in the lending space, obviously, in the Defi space. It's pretty interesting to me how USDCs or asset backed stablecoins are usually the preferred choice as the initial pool of liquidity. What is your view of things like Dai or algorithmically back stable coins? Do you think that there's a chance where regulators will eventually look kindly upon these things? Or like, is this always, like, in the shadows kind of banking?
00:27:41.154 - 00:28:50.754, Speaker B: I'm actually very optimistic about algorithmically backed, and algorithmically backed is maybe not the right way. Cause it's not just an algorithm. These are all collateralized in some way, right? It's just, what is the collateral and how is that determined at any given time to maintain a peg? So the notion that you could underlie a stable value currency from a set of other underlying with an incentive system to hold the peg makes it. I mean, we're seeing that happen. We're seeing like, Luna is doing this. There's, I think, a new project that is in the Solana ecosystem, which is trying to basically use the futures funding curve to build a stable value dollar peg that could also be applied to other things as well. So using basically bitcoin futures as a way to actually maintain a dollar peg, because it's actually a reliable price oracle in a sense.
00:28:50.754 - 00:30:14.754, Speaker B: But so I'm actually very bullish over the long run, and I think it's one of the. One of the. So the way I think about it is synthetic, you know, synthetic cryptocurrencies that maintain stable value that ultimately could be composed and built off of a number of things I think hold a lot of promise over the long run. And I think governments actually could be fine with these if they were reliable as a medium of exchange and if they had really, really robust liquidity. At the end of the day, the liquidity will really matter. Can these be widely accepted as financial instruments? Can people, if a given country, you still need to pay your taxes in Fedwire. Can you get into Fedwire somehow? Can it translate down? Maybe I'm being too optimistic, but I actually think over the long run, and these could be really significant.
00:30:16.254 - 00:30:50.344, Speaker A: Well, like, I think, you know, like in the back in the day, we went through, like, an early days of banking. People would offer bank accounts and then those banks would disappear. Right. And this is where regulation came from. Right. Is there a fear that we have this technology that lets anybody basically spin up a new coin, a new bank in some sense? Right. Is that a fear that people lose confidence if these are, like, framed as dollars but are not things going on?
00:30:50.724 - 00:32:27.026, Speaker B: I think you will very likely see greater amounts of regulatory definition, jurisdiction by jurisdiction. If you just take Europe, the UK, Singapore, US, just take some number of big jurisdictions that are super big in global financial markets, and you will have stable coins that are designated as legitimate financial instruments of the financial system that actually are licensed. You get a stamp of approval, you're licensed to do that. And I think that's, at the end of the day, regulation and licenses are like a social contract, and it's sort of society understands who you are because you've got this social contract in place to sort of meet certain obligations. And that then is a signaling mechanism to actors to depend on it and use it. And so I think it's unlikely, I think it's very unlikely anytime in the near term that something like a crypto collateralized, dollar pegged, stablecoin would be recognized at all as something that's an acceptable form of collateral or payment. In that context, market participants who are operating in these trading markets might rely on that.
00:32:27.026 - 00:32:38.194, Speaker B: Certain end users might say, hey, I prefer this for various reasons, and do it. I think it'll be hard to make that full leap, at least in the short to medium term.
00:32:39.334 - 00:32:51.750, Speaker A: I'm not a finance guy, but I'm trying to. My understanding of a bank is that they can have lots of different assets. You look at bank of America's bank, it's a trillion dollars of different stuff.
00:32:51.902 - 00:33:11.012, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. There's on balance sheet and there's off balance sheet, and there's a huge, huge variety. Yeah. Absolutely. But they have, there are fiduciary powers and there's fiduciary responsibilities against that, and there's sort of all these various obligations around it and liquidity covenants and everything.
00:33:11.068 - 00:33:19.588, Speaker A: Else, and they're able to issue loans at a greater amount than the deposits that intel has given them.
00:33:19.716 - 00:33:22.380, Speaker B: That's right, that's right, yeah.
00:33:22.492 - 00:33:28.706, Speaker A: Which is effectively backed by the assets that they have and potentially the equity of the company to make itself.
00:33:28.820 - 00:33:41.834, Speaker B: Right, that's right, that's right. And it's a leverage ratio. Right. It's Basel III reserve requirements, which is sort of that, you know, the outstanding loan book can be basically eight times larger than the deposit base.
00:33:42.414 - 00:33:47.822, Speaker A: Isn't that basically a stable coin, like an algorithmic stable coin?
00:33:47.918 - 00:35:37.854, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, arguably it's sort of the probability of being able to make whole on the claim based on a set of market liquidity assumptions. So if you look at the banking system Basel III, which is the framework that's currently kind of in place globally on liquidity requirements and reserve requirements for banks, it was sort of put in place post financial crisis. It was beefing up the kind of risk management that was necessary because of all the not great risk management that happened. It sort of has these sort of generalized views of, you need to be able to meet in a stress scenario with this amount of outflow demand over a sustained period over 30 days. You need to be able to meet your dollar for dollar liquidity requirements. And then the way that they measure your ability to do that is by basically risk scoring the assets on your balance sheet against liquidity, known liquidity, and they're constantly looking at like, okay, what's the difference between, say, a corporate bond from Taco Bell versus a corporate bond from apple versus a 30 day us treasury instrument and everything in between. And so you rate all these for their liquidity characteristics, and then that gives you a sense for, in an outflow scenario, which whole lot of assumptions around it, can you always deliver that dollar.
00:35:38.754 - 00:35:47.362, Speaker A: So who is coding up the Basel three smart contract that literally we need?
00:35:47.498 - 00:36:27.222, Speaker B: Also, the problem is there's like crypto collateral. None of the crypto collateral would qualify. You have 100% rating. So cash at a central bank is considered 100% liquid, right? And then certain cash equivalents are also considered 100% liquid, and then the thing degrades and like a shit coin only tradable on like this. A Dex is probably not going to fall under the definitions of high quality liquid assets and, and so on. Bitcoin itself would probably get a pretty significant haircut.
00:36:27.358 - 00:36:29.554, Speaker A: Well, we start with what we have, right?
00:36:30.694 - 00:36:35.278, Speaker B: I mean, the principles are all the same, right? Principles are all the same. Absolutely, absolutely.
00:36:35.366 - 00:36:46.394, Speaker A: That's fascinating. Yeah, I mean, this is me learning about finance by understanding like the ave smart contract first and then asking your questions. How do banks work?
00:36:48.534 - 00:36:56.976, Speaker B: I've come at this like you as like a technologist and kind of figuring out this stuff along the way. Yeah, yeah.
00:36:57.160 - 00:37:21.658, Speaker A: Well that's great. I mean, that's pretty interesting. I almost feel like the real path to this adoption is going to be that early startups move on chain because there's more opportunity there. And then they grow and mature and become these very stable revenue, very liquid, very stable, very respectable assets, and then maybe that's like a ten year transformation.
00:37:21.786 - 00:37:46.766, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. Completely agree. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting, it speaks to, I think there's some, some of these like market analysis sites. I think like Masari, some of these have like, yeah, they sort of have liquidity ratings or even like, I guess coin market cap has some of that too. I'm trying to see where that, where that is.
00:37:46.766 - 00:38:29.564, Speaker B: If you like, click on an asset. Let's look at Solana, let's see ratings analysis. Some of these sites have basically they look at the liquidity characteristics of any given asset, but that ultimately would be something that would be a great on chain oracleized data is just like real time. What are the liquidity characteristics of any given token? And then therefore, how could you discount it against an overall basket of risk? That's then something that's underlying an underlying issue, et cetera.
00:38:31.304 - 00:39:09.694, Speaker A: I mean, I wonder if eventually that's possible to do this entirely from on chain data, zero knowledge proof about evaluating the state. Here's everything that's been happening over the last month. But that's maybe science fiction. Yeah, but I mean, in general, like if you can have high quality tokens, I mean, high quality tokens plus oracles that can do some high bird's eye view analysis of what are the maybe structural risks outside of just the chain activity, it seems like very doable. That's exciting.
00:39:10.474 - 00:40:13.950, Speaker B: I mean, over a very long period, of course, if you think about a corporate bond, you have a ratings agency that's looking at a corporate bond and they're looking at the basic rating agency is looking at the, ideally it's a public issuer, so it's a public financials, and there's an auditor who's actually auditing and sort of saying that these financials are accurate. And then underneath that, it's basically a whole bunch of erps and oracle databases of the actual books and records of the actual business and what's going on. And if you step back from that and you sort of say the actual financial accounts of the firm, if the financial accounts themselves basically became on chain. So you have on chain treasury. So the actual. This is like a dao today, is 100% on chain treasury by definition, right? So you can imagine more and more of these corporate forms are actually on chain, where the entire treasury is on chain. The ability to audit it is on chain.
00:40:13.950 - 00:40:50.344, Speaker B: Then the ability to provide a view to the quality of the cash flow or whatever could be done in a much faster, more automated way. And then based on the quality of the cash flow or what have you, you'd have a way to kind of rate it. And then all of a sudden, you have the equivalent of a bond instrument that is, you know, the entire. The entirety of it is sort of happening on chain as well. So, you know, this stuff takes a while, right? But, like, everything's electronic now. We don't. We don't.
00:40:50.344 - 00:41:23.944, Speaker B: We don't, like, have, like, there's not, like a debate, like, can you get to all this stuff in electronic form, right? And it used to be like, well, all that information still somewhere on. On a piece of paper or whatever, or it's electronic, but it's not Internet accessible. Like, now everything's Internet accessible, but still on legacy electronic mediums. So, like, at what point do the really important things, either as proofs or as data itself, kind of move on chain? And that seems over a period of, like 20 to 30 years, not at all science fiction.
00:41:28.044 - 00:41:38.504, Speaker A: What do you think is the. I guess, in your mind, do you think, like, circle is going to eventually be a smart contract? Like, is that. Is that possible?
00:41:39.524 - 00:42:38.834, Speaker B: I mean, it's one of these really interesting questions, which is, like, how do established corporate forms evolve in a world of digital corporate forms? And is this like a world where, I mean, there aren't great. There aren't necessarily great metaphors for this, but I think about, like, there were, like, legacy media companies and legacy communications companies, and then there were companies that were built entirely in software, where the entirety of their media and their communications just software delivered through the Internet. But they were still, like, corporations, right? They still were operating as corporations. And, um, you know, it's a. It's a really open question as to how established corporate forms can become tokenized over time. Um, and. And how that takes place and what kind of laws need to happen to allow that to take place.
00:42:42.614 - 00:42:53.534, Speaker A: I. It's wild, I guess slowly, you know, slowly, then all of a sudden is probably how it's going to happen.
00:42:54.234 - 00:43:16.010, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, things can achieve a lot of scale quickly. Yeah. And it's going to, you know, it's going to be one of those things where like, there's some kind of on chain organization that achieves, I mean, like axie infinity. Right. Whatever. Take.
00:43:16.010 - 00:44:03.126, Speaker B: Take an example like that where it's like this on chain thing with all these members and all this stuff. You're going to have next set of things like that. Maybe it's an on chain uber or whatever, something that happens where it's just like, boom, it just gets this usage and then it forces courts basically all around the world to interpret this thing and be like, what is the grounding of this? How do we interpret this? I actually think a lot of this stuff gets figured out not by, like, you know, lawmakers going and, like, dreaming it up. I think it's. It's like, it's like case law. Like, stuff's just going to happen and it's going to. People going to have to interpret this stuff and then connect it to common law in some way, and then that will, you know, pave the way for established entities to figure out.
00:44:03.126 - 00:44:09.674, Speaker B: Okay, if that's how it works for a native entity that's done this, then here's how we could adapt to that as well.
00:44:11.454 - 00:44:29.564, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah. And, oh, man, it would be fascinating if this is, like, played out into gaming. Like, I feel like gaming is one of the next frontiers in crypto as a way to onboard a lot of users that are, like, malleable to adoption of this.
00:44:29.604 - 00:44:29.996, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:30.100 - 00:44:33.744, Speaker A: They get tech, they get self organization. Yes.
00:44:36.684 - 00:44:39.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. It's fascinating. It's fascinating. Star Atlas is a cool.
00:44:40.028 - 00:44:40.714, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:41.054 - 00:44:51.474, Speaker B: Really cool project that I've been paying attention to. Who knows where that entity kind of goes, right?
00:44:52.254 - 00:44:53.214, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure.
00:44:53.334 - 00:44:54.514, Speaker B: Projects. Yeah.
00:44:55.374 - 00:45:27.014, Speaker A: Well, always amazing to have to talk to you on these shows. I think we have a few minutes. I'm going to see if there's some folks that have questions. Yeah, let's see what can answer. I'm kind of looking at the chat. So I guess there's a question. Are there resources to learn about financial instruments? Like, if I had to learn the stuff, where would I go? What are the books that you'd recommend?
00:45:27.554 - 00:45:46.282, Speaker B: Oh, my God. It depends, you know. You know, it's interesting. So actually, the bank for international Settlements, which is in Basel, that's where the word Basel. Basel, Switzerland. Right. The bank for International Settlements is the central bank of central banks.
00:45:46.282 - 00:46:16.714, Speaker B: And then they work on this huge bodies of policy work that then defines, like all these, you know, all these things. And so if you go through like, their definitions. Right. That's one thing. Like that would be a very, like, looking from the top down, kind of how some of that is viewed is an interesting place. Some of it is really hard to get through, but that's certainly interesting.
00:46:18.534 - 00:46:29.394, Speaker A: Well, are there like, this would be where cbdcs are defined or those defined, I guess, would be at the national level.
00:46:30.274 - 00:47:25.824, Speaker B: Yeah. So actually, the bank for international settlements, the BIS is very active on the CBDC topic. And so they're, you know, you can find a whole bunch of stuff they've published, basically. And so, but what the BIS is, is basically it's like an institute where, I mean, there's full time people there, obviously, but there's basically like people go on rotation through there. So people who work at like the New York fed or work at the People's bank of China, or people who work at the European Central bank, or people who work in all these different bodies around the world will get assigned there and they'll work there for a number of years, and then they'll employ all these economists and they'll employ all these kind of policy people. So it's sort of like this hive of the supranational groups and committees, and they run all these committees from all the regulators around the world. And so it's sort of like where a lot of this stuff gets thought about.
00:47:25.824 - 00:48:06.914, Speaker B: So now they have like a big central bank digital currency practice, and they're trying to convene and develop common principles. And so, you know, they have the committee for payment market infrastructures, the CPMI, which is basically like defines what is an allowable, like systemic payment market infrastructure, like Swift or Fedwire or visa or what have you. And so these are like super, super tightly defined things that exist in those levels. And so that's where a lot of that work comes from.
00:48:10.894 - 00:48:11.914, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:48:13.614 - 00:48:14.394, Speaker B: Cool.
00:48:15.574 - 00:48:34.300, Speaker A: Let me see if there's anyone else. Do you have any advice for youngsters? I guess what would be a youngster, somebody out of college maybe just. Or in college thinking about. What do they do?
00:48:34.412 - 00:49:16.174, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm pretty simple on this stuff. The sort of Joseph Campbell, follow your bliss. Find something that you really enjoy and that you're inspired by and just go after that and, you know, doesn't have to have anything to do with what you studied or what you do. Or what your job is, it's just, like, if there's something that really captures your imagination and you're really excited about and passionate about, just go after that. Like, that, to me, is if you're following your bliss, like, the rest will follow. So that's, like, really basic advice, but, you know, I think, yeah, that's, like, really basic advice.
00:49:16.634 - 00:49:38.282, Speaker A: Yeah, that's good advice. I would honestly offer the same as, uh, you know, uh, take. Take the hardest classes you can on the stuff that you really enjoy, and, like, don't worry about the grades so much. And, like, if you get lucky and you end up going deep into some subject, and that becomes your career, like, you'll be happy.
00:49:38.418 - 00:49:40.346, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
00:49:40.410 - 00:49:43.564, Speaker A: That's. That's kind of the coolest thing, I think.
00:49:43.944 - 00:50:16.084, Speaker B: All those things I, like, studied political science and philosophy and economics, but where did I spend my time? I just spent my time diving in Internet tech, and that's all I. And then I made all my classwork about the Internet. It was in the early 1990s, but that's what I found. I just found myself down the rabbit hole on Internet technology, and so that's what my career became, um, even though it had nothing to do with what I studied, per se.
00:50:16.164 - 00:50:25.396, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good advice. Well, um, I think we're getting pretty close to the end of the interview, so want to thank you again. This has.
00:50:25.420 - 00:50:26.380, Speaker B: Yeah, you're welcome.
00:50:26.572 - 00:50:32.604, Speaker A: Been a pleasure. Um, and thank you for. For sharing your thoughts with all the folks building on Solana.
00:50:32.764 - 00:50:39.188, Speaker B: Absolutely. I'm super excited to see what comes out of all of it. It's just an amazing community, and we're just happy to be a part of it.
00:50:39.356 - 00:50:40.100, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:50:40.252 - 00:50:41.788, Speaker B: Cool. All right, take care, man.
00:50:41.916 - 00:50:42.784, Speaker A: Take care.
00:50:44.124 - 00:50:45.244, Speaker B: What you need?
