00:00:01.400 - 00:00:33.094, Speaker A: So we just finished our saga event here in Melbourne and as part of the presentation, we captured a photo of our audience live here. And I wanted to take that and show you how easy it is to use minty fresh to mint that as an NFT on chain. So I'm going to take the photo. This is what we captured. I'm going to give it a quick title here. This is our saga audience and we took this photo in Melbourne and I'm going to mint this on chain. We're going to give it a quick signature, use our seed vault fingerprints.
00:00:33.094 - 00:00:59.384, Speaker A: And now we're uploading this file to ipfs. Takes a moment to upload, but once it's uploaded, it's going to ask us to apply one more signature to do our NFT mint. So as soon as this is ready, I will come back into our soulflare wallet. Here we go. We're going to put one more signature on this. There we go. We've minted that as an NFT.
00:00:59.384 - 00:01:23.864, Speaker A: I'm going to hop over to our soulflare wallet and refresh our collectibles. Let me just quickly refresh that. And there it is, live on chain. We've minted an NFT from a photo we took just minutes ago.
