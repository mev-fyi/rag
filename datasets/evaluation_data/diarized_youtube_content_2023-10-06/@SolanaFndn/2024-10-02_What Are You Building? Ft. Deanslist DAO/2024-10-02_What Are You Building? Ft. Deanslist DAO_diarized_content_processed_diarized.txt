00:00:04.400 - 00:00:32.027, Speaker A: Today I'm joined by Wade's friend. So please tell us, what are you building? Hello everybody. We're building Dinslies Dao, which is a small accelerator which works with hackathons organized by the Solana ecosystem, verifies that these projects continue building after winning their prizes. Cool. How do you do that? We do this by assembling small teams of power users and a few developers. Check their code and make sure that they are still around. Awesome.
00:00:32.027 - 00:00:37.595, Speaker A: Check out Dean's list if you have participated in a hackathon before. And thank you very much for sharing. Thank you. Thank you for being here.
