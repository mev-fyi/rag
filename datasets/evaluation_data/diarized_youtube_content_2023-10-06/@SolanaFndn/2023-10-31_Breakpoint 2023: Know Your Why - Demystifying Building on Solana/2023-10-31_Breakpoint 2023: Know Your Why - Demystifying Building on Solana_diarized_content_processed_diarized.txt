00:00:01.200 - 00:00:41.030, Speaker A: The title of this talk is demystifying building on Solana. And I don't know that it's really about that, to be honest with you at this point. But hopefully you'll get a little something out of this. You'll smile a little bit, have a little bit of fun. Really. What it comes down to, as I was going over, what I was going to talk about, building on Solana, building in web3, building anything, anywhere, comes down to talent, grit, luck. And I was talking to a couple people earlier today about how the better you get at the first two things, the less of that third one you need.
00:00:41.030 - 00:01:26.314, Speaker A: And talent is really, you know, what's your skill? What's your ability to learn new things? What's your ability to create, to solve problems? That's talent. Grit is how willing are you to deal with the hard part? How stubborn are you? Also, how willing are you to adjust how you define success almost on a regular basis. You know, this time rust yelled at me and the compiler yelled at me ten times, and next time it's nine. That's success. So you got to be willing to define success multiple ways for yourself. And then luck is really time, place, conditions, audience, opportunity. That stuff has to match up.
00:01:26.314 - 00:02:08.006, Speaker A: Yeah, you can make a lot of your own luck, but at the end of the day, the people that make it in this industry, in any industry, in anything in the world, there's an element of luck that is out of our control. And so one of the things I'm going to talk about a little bit later on is if you don't love what you're doing, all the hard work and talent in the world does not mean you're going to get there. You're going to need some things that are out of your control to go right. So you might as well enjoy the process. Little bit about me. You gotta be more dog.
00:02:08.190 - 00:02:30.264, Speaker B: I used to be a cat. Every day the same. I'd be aloof till lunch, then coldly indifferent after. To me, everything was just, yeah. Then it hit me, why be so cat? Why not be a bit more dog?
00:02:34.284 - 00:02:36.304, Speaker C: Savior of the universe.
00:02:38.964 - 00:02:52.704, Speaker B: I mean, look at the world today. It's amazing. Running, amazing. Chasing cars, amazing. Sticks, amazing. Carpe diem. It means grab the frisbee.
00:02:52.704 - 00:03:03.464, Speaker B: Maybe we should all be a bit more dog. Be more dog.
00:03:04.004 - 00:03:34.412, Speaker A: Otun. So I love that video, and I actually use video on my talks because to listen to me talk for 30 minutes straight is probably very painful. And I also need to take a breath because I talk really fast and I'm not good at taking breaths. So it's kind of, you know, dual purpose there. My builder story is a little different. I'm obviously a little bit of an older guy than a lot of the folks that are here. As a kid, I was a builder minded kai.
00:03:34.412 - 00:04:35.166, Speaker A: I used to take old hockey sticks and try to build a guitar out of them by putting pickups on it and all kinds of stuff. As an adult, I decided I wanted to be an educator, and I really wanted to work in school and with programs that were new or dying or unsuccessful, because I love the challenge of building something weak, something small into something big and something strong and working with people to do that. My first coaching job, I took over a program that hadn't won a game in a couple years and went to the playoffs right away. That was super satisfying. My first administrator job as a principal was taking over a school that had gone through fifth grade and adding a middle school program one year at a time. So always kind of had that builder mindset. But in 2019, life kind of smacked me in the face.
00:04:35.166 - 00:05:10.536, Speaker A: I'd been in education for almost 30 years, and I got sick. I am a cancer survivor. That's me holding up six fingers. Cause I was halfway through chemo. So in 2019, if you think about what was going on in the world and in schools at that time. Got diagnosed with cancer in November, had what's called a whipple surgery in December, was in the hospital for two weeks. The whipple is basically, they open you up, take half of what's inside you out, try to replumb it so your body works again and sew you back up.
00:05:10.536 - 00:05:53.468, Speaker A: And so during that time, COVID hit, and a week after I started chemo, we had to go on emergency remote learning. So I was running a school remotely while I was going through chemo. Actually worked out really well, because it's a whole lot easier to go through chemo and work while you're laying on your sofa than it is actually walking around a building. So I considered it a great opportunity, but it also showed me that I was kind of at the end of that part of my life. For the second time in five years, I cheated death. The first one was, I'm also six years sober, recovering alcoholic, and addict. I don't mind talking about that.
00:05:53.468 - 00:06:22.954, Speaker A: I drove my truck into a ravine, almost killed myself. So I was done with all that other stuff. I wanted to feel alive again and get back to building and had an opportunity. One of my former students was big into crypto, and he sent me down the rabbit hole. That's how I got here. So I think it's important to talk about that. And it is relevant because, you know, you have to have a mindset to be in this space and you have to have a mindset to be successful.
00:06:22.954 - 00:06:53.064, Speaker A: And it's, you know, I think, the greatest attribute of Solana that I love most, and I'm going to talk about this a little bit more in a second, is it's resilient. It's easily the most resilient environment. If you think about what's happened over the last year, it's inspiring how resilient the community of Solana has been. And that resonates with me because I think that that's, you know, the attribute that I've been most gifted with. Another video for you.
00:06:53.184 - 00:07:23.234, Speaker C: Evening. Evening. May I ring that up for you? Yes, please. Have a good evening. You repeat after me. A, c, c, d, e, f, g. No, no, no.
00:07:23.314 - 00:07:23.882, Speaker A: Not good.
00:07:23.978 - 00:07:38.314, Speaker C: Not good. Just the sound that words make. Cut, dog, cut. Salamari, trash on the beach. That's it. Good.
00:07:38.354 - 00:07:38.934, Speaker A: Good.
00:07:39.874 - 00:08:16.654, Speaker C: Farm fresh. My son and I mowed the grass. What's the gold score? Unbelievable.
00:08:30.894 - 00:08:31.462, Speaker D: Dad.
00:08:31.558 - 00:08:34.234, Speaker C: Hey, Tubbs, I read your book.
00:08:34.534 - 00:08:45.074, Speaker D: You read my book? Barman, give that man a bell.
00:08:51.654 - 00:09:36.734, Speaker A: So I really love that video. It's inspiring. The irony of it being an alcohol video is not lost on me, but it's inspiring because if you get the whole thing, guy learned how to read so he could read his son's book. As a dad who, a couple years ago, had to learn a lot of really new stuff. You know, I think that if you're, if you, if you know your why, which was originally part of the conversation here, knowing why you're doing what you're doing helps you overcome a lot of the hard stuff. And what, and a big part of my why is my kids, I, you know, my kids inspire me. They're cool.
00:09:36.734 - 00:10:26.854, Speaker A: My daughter's a total djen. She had her first NFT project at eleven, her second one at twelve and a half, and even though that second one was on Tara, which she had about $3,500 in Luna, that's now worth less than Shib. But that's inspiring. And so my kids inspire me. And so I think that videos like that, it's good to watch. So let's talk about why a little bit. What do I love most about web3? I could sit in a room with however many people from all over the world, from all different backgrounds, cultures, races, religions, preferences, everything.
00:10:26.854 - 00:11:10.480, Speaker A: And all those differences. Nobody cares. Nobody is here talking about any of that stuff we're talking about, hey, what are you building? That's cool. And how can we work together? It's almost like this archetypal, utopian, inclusive environment that really what brings us together is the thrill of the build and we forget about all the differences. And so that's actually my most favorite thing about web3. You know, at WBA, when we have our classes, we're all over the world and we're coming together, embodying over this thing. And if you see us walking around, you're gonna see how close we really are.
00:11:10.480 - 00:11:42.488, Speaker A: And that's something that we're really proud of, is the culture and how supportive we are of each other. I already said what I love most about Solana. It's resilient. Don't get me wrong, the tech is cool, it's super fast. But I love the mindset of, you know, let's break this and make it better. You know, the idea that who cares if it was going down over, you know, over a year ago, you know, that's old news. We broke it and made it faster, made it more resilient, made it better.
00:11:42.488 - 00:12:25.380, Speaker A: And what it does is that draws the kinds of people for whom that is the culture that speaks to them. And it's a self sustaining cycle of, you keep attracting more people like that because it is who you are. You stay true to who you are and you just get stronger and stronger. And so that's what I really love about Solana, and it's about finding your people. It's about culture mattering. The projects on Solana that leave, you could look at them and you could think, that really wasn't a culture fit anyway. And the projects that stay and work through the adversity, those are good.
00:12:25.380 - 00:13:13.544, Speaker A: Culture fits. So I was an english teacher, and so I talk about community, and it's all in the articles. So you have the community, a community, and the possessive pronoun, your community. So when I talk about finding your community, find your community, okay? Not a general community or the global community, find the one that speaks to you, because that will be the one that is most inspiring and supportive. And I encourage you also, as builders, figure out what your impact is. If your impact is helping people make a lot of money, great. If your impact is making people feel really good by talking about NFT art, great.
00:13:13.544 - 00:13:40.642, Speaker A: But think about the impact that you want to make. Again, it's going to help you in your process. And just a little bit about building. We always talk about users first. And I think as developers, a lot of times, people think, we got to think about the code first. We work with a lot of people who are new to building, and they want to get into the code first, and we're like, no, no, no. You got to think about user first.
00:13:40.642 - 00:14:50.604, Speaker A: You got to think about what is that person's experience going to be using this application? In our process, we have a capstone project where every one of our graduates has to build a unique proof of concept MVP that is on Devnet in order to graduate. And the first thing we have them do after they've selected their topic is they have to write a user story. And we actually have them go back to that user story with every step after that. So they're always remembering what the primary purpose is, which is to serve that user. I do want to demystify rust real quickly here because people are a little reticent to get into certain platforms because they see rust and they hear that rust is this super hard, complex language. Writing a smart contract or a program in rust requires about 80 to 100 pages of the 630 pages, the Rust book. Okay? So if you know somebody that's like, oh, rust, it's so hard.
00:14:50.604 - 00:15:23.956, Speaker A: I mean, it's not easy. I think it's harder if you know other languages really well because you have some things that you have to unlearn. It depends. I mean, I've got a friend in the room who rushes her first language learning it. I'm like, ooh, great, some of this is going to be easier for you. But, and I know, by the way, that 630 pages printed out, because I actually printed it out because I'm old and I have to actually take notes in pencil. I have graduated from carving my notes on the side of a wall in hieroglyphics.
00:15:23.956 - 00:15:52.854, Speaker A: I am, you know, evolving. But the hard part about building is not necessarily learning the programming language. I mean, there's other really hard parts, like try setting up to develop on Solana using a Windows machine. That's hard. Don't recommend it. Don't do that, by the way. Also, don't even recommend using WSL.
00:15:52.854 - 00:16:50.526, Speaker A: I'll tell you what else is hard. When everything is working perfectly and macOS updates and your XC run gets all messed up and you can't figure out what you did wrong for three days until you ask Dean and he goes, oh, yeah, your XC runs messed up and you just gotta redo this. And, you know, you say to yourself, why didn't I ask Dean three days ago? Yeah. So anyway, so that's the hard part, setting up your environment testing, because, you know, Apple doesn't call up Solana and say, hey, we're going to do an update. Let's make sure that your version and mine works together well. And as much as the coral guys are integral parts of the Solana community, I don't think they call up Solana and say, we're going to do this update. Let's make sure everything is perfectly aligned so stuff breaks.
00:16:50.526 - 00:17:16.034, Speaker A: Figuring it out, that's hard. Writing tests is hard. Things out of your control are hard. Learning how to code and write programs is not the hard part. It's actually one of the easier parts. It's all the other stuff. So just a quick shill about Rust that I think is important, and I don't think I have to shill anybody here.
00:17:16.034 - 00:18:17.404, Speaker A: But for the folks at home watching this video later on, if you don't think that Rust going to be the core of the future of Web three, if you're one of those people who think that solidity on that other chain is the way the guy who wrote solidity when he built his own chain, what did he use? Rust. Cosmosm rust move the hot new language. Rust based every new project that's coming out. I'll give versatis a shout out to Rust. Yeah, I mean, everybody's going into Rust. You know who's not going into Rust? People who think that EVM liquidity is the only way they're going to make it, and they're wrong. So anyway, one piece of advice about building on Solana, 60% of your learning is going to be on three accounts, PDA's and cpIs.
00:18:17.404 - 00:18:50.694, Speaker A: Okay? So don't try to learn everything. If you're going to allocate a certain amount of time to learning a certain number of concepts. There you have it right there. You want to expedite this process and you really want to get yourself ready to do some big work. I mean, obviously, I'd like everybody who's serious about being a full time builder to come to WBA, but you want to do this. Focus on those three things. And I don't have a slide for this, but I'll tweet it out later.
00:18:50.694 - 00:19:45.812, Speaker A: If you really want to have a deep understanding of how Solana programs work, go get the Pawlux escrow article and tutorial. Go through that and understand it. Then go grab iron addict and Dog's version of the escrow program that he built. An anchor. And I like when Dean tells the story because he knows aid and tells the story about. Yeah, he basically just you know, studied anchor for a week and then took the Pawlux escrow and built it at anchor. And so do those two and do a little comparative analysis between how do we get from native Rustland Solana to anchor? And then go ahead and grab the repo called based anchor and look at what we've done with the escrow program and look at the next step of the evolution of how to understand how to build on Solana.
00:19:45.812 - 00:20:13.974, Speaker A: Now. You could just use anchor and learn just anchor. But not understanding how it got to where it is now means you're just going to be using it. If you really want to make an impact, which is what we do, make it better, find ways to break it. You know, I love in class when we're doing a piece of code, and Dean goes, hold on, I'll be right back. And he comes back, he goes, I just whipped up this macro. It makes this step a whole lot better.
00:20:13.974 - 00:20:57.314, Speaker A: You know, that's the mindset that we need to have, because the Solana and the anchor that we're working with today is not the one that we were working with yesterday, and it should definitely not be the one that we're using tomorrow. Did this change? There we go. So what's a good little process here? So, you know, I tell about the house metaphor, talk about building, and the house metaphor is a good way of thinking about the build process. What's the first thing you do when you want to move into a new house? Well, you got to pick your neighborhood. You got to pick your community. Why do you move there? Well, I like the schools. I like the people.
00:20:57.314 - 00:21:18.672, Speaker A: My business will do well in this community. It's a good, you know, it's a good place for my kids. There's people who have shared values. That's the same reason you build in a certain ecosystem. So what do you do next? Well, I need to figure out what my house needs. I'm going to draw a blueprint. Okay.
00:21:18.672 - 00:22:12.684, Speaker A: How many kids, how many rooms? Do I need a big kitchen because I like to cook? Do I need an island in the middle? You know, do I want french stores over there? These are all design decisions that, it's the same way. You build a protocol, build an application. Okay? Then you get your pieces, you go shopping, get all your materials, and you always get more materials than you actually need, because you want to have the flexibility to change in the process of building because something new comes up. That is a better way to have this build. You may think that, oh, I want the double windows over there, and then later, move it over there because the sun's better on that side. You want to give yourself the flexibility to do that. And at the end of your build, you got a big old dumpster in front of your house full of stuff that you can now repurpose.
00:22:12.684 - 00:22:40.478, Speaker A: We tell our people all the time, don't delete code. Have, like, a trash bin of code that you maybe don't want to use there. But on a new project, you might say, hey, this is a great piece of code that I could use. Maybe that window didn't fit in that first house I built, but on my vacation home, I can now use that window. So, you know, have that. That process. And the other thing here is that it seems like riding a bike doesn't fit in with building a house metaphor.
00:22:40.478 - 00:23:12.854, Speaker A: But, you know, if you want to learn how to ride a bike, you're not going to watch a bunch of videos on it. Are you not going to read a bunch of stories about how to ride a bike? Because if you do that and then you get on a bike, you're going to fall. If you want to learn how to ride a bike, get on the bike and ride it. Fall a bunch of times, get back on and ride it. That's building. Building isn't watching videos of other people riding a bike and saying, I'll copy that, and imagine myself on the bike. No, get on the bike.
00:23:12.854 - 00:23:27.016, Speaker A: Ride, fall. Ride, ride, fall. You might need training wheels, which is download some boilerplate code and change some stuff around. Cool. Get those training wheels off. Ride and fall. Find a big hill.
00:23:27.016 - 00:23:46.338, Speaker A: Go down it, jump. Just push it, push it, push it. That's the riding the bike. So, you know, you start with a question. You start with an idea. I always tell people, look in your local community on things that need to be solved. Can that be solved with blockchain? Okay, great.
00:23:46.338 - 00:24:21.604, Speaker A: What's the user story? What's the diagram look like? What's a prototype? This is called design thinking. Okay? Solving problems. Design thinking is very cool. And we start really simple. Sometimes, you know, sitting out, having a burger, draw something up on a napkin. When I coached football, I had a binder of napkins with plays drawn all over it. Still do it today, you know, what's it look like? You make it really simple, then we can make it really complicated.
00:24:21.604 - 00:24:45.028, Speaker A: I love Miro. I think it's really cool. But, I mean, this is part of the process, and it is all about process. And always remember that no matter what you do, right. You could do everything perfect. Everything. You know, what happens? I can't say it.
00:24:45.028 - 00:25:35.454, Speaker A: I don't want to get bleeped out. All right, so always keep the faith, enjoy the process, because there's no guarantee that even if you do everything right, even if you write the most perfect code, even if your UI is absolutely glorious and it's completely frictionless, it doesn't mean it's going to succeed. So you got to enjoy it and enjoy the people you're doing it with. I'm really lucky. So our team at WBA, we're super close. Dean's here, Leo, Juan, a lot of our guys, Andre, people come, people stay. We built a culture that people want to be part of and we're really close because we work really hard together and we do it in person.
00:25:35.454 - 00:26:21.624, Speaker A: And for me, that's the gift of what we do. So real quickly, raise your hand if you're a dev, founder, self proclaimed Djen. All of the above, these people are here, people like us are here. I think to a certain extent, we gotta shift a little bit to building for the people that aren't here because, you know, the people that are gonna be part of this world are already here. We've got to draw the people who are skeptical or not ready yet. We gotta pull them in. We gotta build stuff for people that aren't here to get them in.
00:26:21.624 - 00:26:29.184, Speaker A: Before I drop a little alpha, don't listen to the haters.
00:26:29.804 - 00:27:19.384, Speaker D: They told me it couldn't be done, that I was the lost cough. I was picked on and picked last. Coaches didn't know how to talk to me. They gave up on me, told me I should just quit they didn't call my name, told me it was over but I've been deaf since I was three, so I didn't listen. And now I'm here with a lot of fans in the NFL cheering me on and I can hear them all.
00:27:26.724 - 00:27:51.064, Speaker A: So one of my, it's one of my favorite videos. That's Derek Coleman. I love the line. I've been deaf since I was three, so I didn't listen. Look, in doing what we're trying to do, there's going to be probably more hard times than good ones. So you gotta love what you're doing and you gotta love who you're doing it with. And I love the people I work with, I really do.
00:27:51.064 - 00:28:47.706, Speaker A: Being able to be with them in person this week has been just a tremendous gift. So I'm gonna leave you all with a little alpha here. This is our first public commenting of this. How many of you know little JavaScript or typescript a little. How many of you know anchor? So there's a difference in the number of people who know a little typescript and JavaScript and a little bit of anchor. Can you imagine this fantasy world where you could actually write anchor programs in typescript? Would that be cool? Well, Poseidon is coming. Poseidon is going to let you write anchor programs in typescript.
00:28:47.706 - 00:29:14.648, Speaker A: And so your captain Dean is going to lead you on the journey. Certainly the most brilliant developer I know, and equally a good dude. Yeah, soon. It's already very well into development. If you're interested in learning more about how we're doing this and what we're doing, just reach out to us. But this is happening. It's a long time coming.
00:29:14.648 - 00:29:47.014, Speaker A: We've got a lot of validation from people all over Solana between labs and foundation on doing this, and so it's coming. And we need y'all's help to flesh out the library to make it strong, and to pull in yet another big group of developers to show them how amazing it is to use the Solana blockchain. This is my contact information if you want to get in touch with me, talk about anything, and I'm going to run this right down to 1413 1112. Thanks so much. Enjoy the rest of the week.
