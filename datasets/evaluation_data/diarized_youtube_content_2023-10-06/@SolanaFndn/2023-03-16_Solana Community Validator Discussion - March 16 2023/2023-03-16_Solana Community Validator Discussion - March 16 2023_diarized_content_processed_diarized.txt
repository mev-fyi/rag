00:00:01.880 - 00:00:35.346, Speaker A: All right, welcome, everyone to the validator community discussion. Got exciting agenda today. So some validator updates. I'll do those pretty quick. Then Anatoly is going to talk about a blog post he made about testing and release and all the initiatives that we're doing to kind of harden how we're shipping software. And then at the end, Gito is going to talk about an article they wrote about some spam findings that they have on the network. So first update, which you're already talking about in chat, Solana's birthday today.
00:00:35.346 - 00:00:53.974, Speaker A: So happy third birthday, Solana. The first block on Mainnet was March 16, 2020. Rats. I just want to say I've been here for a little over a year now, and so much stuff has shipped in that amount of time. So it's pretty amazing the progress that's happened since we launched.
00:00:56.724 - 00:00:57.784, Speaker B: Here real quick.
00:01:01.124 - 00:01:21.854, Speaker A: Yeah. The main validator update for this week is about Testnet. So testnet was restarted and downgraded to 113.6. Make sure you are running 113.6 just because that's what we're trying to do with this test. If you're not a 113.6, then we can't really test the upgrade process correctly.
00:01:21.854 - 00:01:46.974, Speaker A: Also, a note, if you use no incremental snapshots during the restart, make sure to remove that flag and restart your node. Otherwise you won't be saving incremental snapshots. So please, please, please remove that and restart your node if you haven't done that already. Any questions on that? Still, happy birthday in the chat. Awesome.
00:01:49.324 - 00:01:50.420, Speaker B: All right, cool.
00:01:50.492 - 00:01:57.904, Speaker A: I'll kick it off to Anatoly. He's going to talk about this article that he wrote and answer some questions.
00:01:59.564 - 00:02:00.388, Speaker B: Hey, guys.
00:02:00.516 - 00:02:51.424, Speaker C: Yeah. Happy birthday to Solana. So when I get into the testing differences, I don't know if you guys remember how 114 came about. We actually intended for this code to be released as 111, but, and that was, I would say, around July of August, July or August last year. But it was taking so long for that code base to stabilize that we effectively killed 112 and created 113, which is 110 plus quick changes, and then 114 became the rest of the code. So from that timeline, 114 has been tested on testnet basically from that July date. Like, all this code has been running and being stress tested.
00:02:51.424 - 00:03:52.022, Speaker C: But I think because of this failure, we, I think, realize that there's some gaps in that testing. So usually we have, like, kind of leave adversarial testing up to our internal teams kind of doing it ad hoc and researchers submitting bug bounties and things like that, and I think that has left some gaps in the kind of coverage that we need. This particular bug took a really long time for us to simulate. Basically, jalsing has been trying it since the crash, and we just got what we thought was the theoretical bug that caused it. We just got it to be actually verifiably triggered in simulation. So these are like really, really gnarly difficult things and involve a bunch of different components. So part of the changes that we're doing is that, like, we have an internal adversarial team, a bunch of folks, basically we call it the invalidator.
00:03:52.022 - 00:04:33.046, Speaker C: It's going to be a private repo because we don't want other users to use these tools that may not, they got to go build it themselves, but we're effectively going to be stress testing testnet, sending like unexpected, like trying to trigger unexpected behavior. It's actually really, really hard to trigger these kinds of failures. Takes a long time. That test that actually triggered, we were able to verify what we thought was the theoretical failure. It took 4 hours of spamming our test cluster. So it's not like immediate. These things are, you know, like generally nook and wood.
00:04:33.046 - 00:05:32.864, Speaker C: The network is actually pretty stable, but there's these like fluke conditions that I think we really need to spend a lot of time tracking down. And it's going to be a lot of work. And that means we got to tighten that process. So part of that is also like inviting folks like Jitto, like block route to run their infra on tusnet to, to make sure that we're much closer to, to what we expect to the real world behavior. And that should hopefully let us catch these bugs much, much earlier. And also, I think what's really important for us to verify is I think the upgrade process can be much improved. I think the reason for us to downgrade to 113 is that we want to actually test the exact same upgrade we're going to run on Mainnet from 113 to 114, run that on Testnet and have Testnet actually demonstrate that the upgrade works and then the downgrade works as well.
00:05:32.864 - 00:05:56.414, Speaker C: I think that that's pretty important. We'll have the full docs and what happened out once we have all the patches out. So that's probably going to take maybe a couple more weeks, just as like, the prs are getting reviewed and getting tested and all that stuff.
00:06:01.714 - 00:06:02.186, Speaker B: Cool.
00:06:02.250 - 00:06:12.934, Speaker A: Thank you. Anatoly, any questions about that? Yeah, Brian, go ahead.
00:06:15.034 - 00:06:27.160, Speaker D: Are you then going to try to replicate that same issue on Testnet, like try to crash test net roll it back, fix it, then roll it forward again. I mean, I realize it's a whole lot of back and forth.
00:06:27.272 - 00:06:27.520, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:27.552 - 00:06:58.450, Speaker C: We've been actually trying to crash Testnet, and it hasn't crashed. We've only been able to crash a cluster in, like, a very isolated one that we hacked up to really try to create that corner case on purpose. It's pretty hard because of, like, these are non deterministic behaviors and really requires that, like, one random validator maybe was rebooting at the wrong time or something like that. And to force that for us to occur on testnet is really, really hard.
00:06:58.562 - 00:07:01.254, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Just curious. I get it. It's really hard.
00:07:01.554 - 00:07:02.334, Speaker E: Thanks.
00:07:06.754 - 00:07:07.178, Speaker B: Cool.
00:07:07.226 - 00:07:08.414, Speaker A: Any other questions?
00:07:14.254 - 00:07:16.982, Speaker B: Nope. Okay, cool.
00:07:17.038 - 00:07:33.870, Speaker A: Thank you, Anatoly. We'll kick it off to judo, then. So let me. Yeah, judo's got this blog post up about some MeV that they investigated, or Mev Spam, I should say that they investigated on Mainnet. So I think Lucas is going to.
00:07:33.942 - 00:08:08.870, Speaker B: Talk a bit about that. Yeah, I have a quick deck to share. Sweet. So, yeah, there's a blog post written about the med spam happening on Solana. There's a lot of teams that are working to solve this. Obviously, labs has put in a lot of work into this with Qwik and priority fees. Max and Mango are working on some SIMD's and things like that, and we're also working on it with the GDA Solana client.
00:08:08.870 - 00:08:48.364, Speaker B: So this is basically, like, how you can make money by reducing med spam on Solana. Yeah, I think we've. I've been on this presentation a few times now, so this might be repeating some parts of it, but the. There's a. There's a lot of, like, spam on Solana continues to remain, like, a big user of blockspace. I'm assuming that everyone here is familiar with Mav. Mav is essentially the value that can be extracted by, like, ordering transactions.
00:08:48.364 - 00:09:34.400, Speaker B: So on Solana, a lot of the math comes from arbitrage. So, like, I'll send a trade that gets executed on chain. You know, people are listening over shreds or on geyser or something, waiting to get an account update on, like, orca. Everyone sees that trade at different time update through geyser, orca, all these bots start to, like, fire off trades. Like, you know, I might fire someone might fire off a trade, like, ten milliseconds after someone else, eleven someone else, twelve someone else. Like, 100 milliseconds are all, like, shooting their priority fees and. Yeah, what ends up happening is like a massive failure rate on those.
00:09:34.400 - 00:10:26.748, Speaker B: So, like, on arbitrages, it's currently hovering around a 95% failure rate for. And then the amount of, the percentage of transactions that this takes up over, the total number of non voting transactions, such as removing votes, uh, it's currently around like 35, 30% to 35%. Um, and so, yeah, I kind of got into, like, why this is happening. Like, ordering is basically a combination of, like, latency, priority fees, and luck. Right now, spam is like the best option to win these trades, and it's super cheap. Um, and we're actually starting to see some, like, searcher PDP, uh, where searchers were like, locking others accounts. And like, this is something that Max brought to my attention and posted SMD.
00:10:26.748 - 00:11:12.216, Speaker B: But you're seeing this PvP start to happen where people are basically wasting compute cycles trying to slow others down. Until now. These are the only stats that we've had recently. Did an investigation on epoch 414. Basically to get into some of the nitty gritty stuff here. How do we label an arbitrage? An arbitrage is defined as a cycle. So basically what we're looking for is someone trying to swap some currency back to the same currency and the same transaction, like USCC to USCC.
00:11:12.216 - 00:11:55.994, Speaker B: There's no reason that a user would do that. Like, it's mainly just arbitrage bots trying to go USDC to Seoul, unlike Orca, and then Seoul to USCC on like Openbook or something. So our algorithm picks up all that. It looked at every single block. There's 379,000 blocks in that epoch. Basically 60% of the compute for this epoch was dedicated to arbitrages, and there was a 98% failure rate. So it ends up working out too, is around 58% of all compute for that epoch was wasted by failed arbitrages.
00:11:55.994 - 00:12:39.818, Speaker B: This is just like block space that these failed arbitrages are taking up just from like spamming, trying to spam, and like, land transactions after, like, users to arbitrage. So, yeah, this is like a main thing that we're focused on at Jito. So, you know, right now, like, spam is the best way to extract Mev on Solana. And with Jito Solana, we added a concept of bundles. Bundles essentially let you define like a very, it's like a well defined ordering of transactions. So I want transaction like ABC to execute, they execute. They're guaranteed to execute sequentially.
00:12:39.818 - 00:13:29.974, Speaker B: If they make it to the validator, they execute all or nothing. So if anything fails, the entire thing will roll back. So it's like a really good way for traders to, like, I know there's a lot of traders that use like, sequence ids where like, things are, you know, you check the sequence id and revert. Or like, MeV traders will just kind of spam to try to land arbitrages. So with bundles, you can basically specify this ordering up front and it's guaranteed to execute in that order. The other thing is, like Mev, on some chains, it's like limited to select few validators that maybe they know how to apply that patch or something like that, and they have the correct contacts to do MeV for them. With our software, we want to make that available to every validator.
00:13:29.974 - 00:14:35.106, Speaker B: Also, like currently, like, MeV isn't really like enough to attract stake. It kind of just goes into your identity account and you can make it make money on that from the priority fees where, like, we want to use MeV to attract steak and kind of use that, like, give validators the option to use that as a carrot to attract steak. And I think that you can also use it as like a carrot to like, decentralize the network as well. And I think the most important thing is, like, the inefficient mev extraction right now in Solana is like kind of clogging Defi. There's a lot of people that are like, right, locking orca or open open book markets with, like, we want to make it extremely efficient so that there's not that much spamming through the use of bundles. And, and I think that there's actually like, massively increased liquidity on defi. Like, if you talk to, like, market makers and things like that on Solana, landing trades is like a big issue for them.
00:14:35.106 - 00:15:24.448, Speaker B: So if we can make landing trades more efficient, then we can bring more liquidity to define Solana. So, yeah, like, how do we, like, what's the path to adoption? So right now, Jita Solana is running on 84 validators. Currently build 16% of all blocks on Solana. The main issue right now is this cold start problem. So, you know, searchers, searchers want to use bundles, they want to use these tools, but it's 16% of stake. It's kind of like, well, I'm just going to wait for some more stake to adopt it or like, you know, I don't want, I don't want to spend the time on this if this isn't going to work out. You know, I can take a while for searchers to, like, get this running on their system, on the other hand, like, validators.
00:15:24.448 - 00:16:02.024, Speaker B: I think after talking to some validators, it's like, we want to see, like, more revenue or more, like, there needs to be, like, more rewards for us to run this. So it's kind of this, like, chicken and egg cold start problem. That's, like, the main thing that we're focusing on right now. Validators, it's like, I think they're, like, the best position to get this file started. Like, the software will, like, for it to work, it needs to be adopted by validators. And so, like, validators are the best position to get this file started. But it takes five minutes to switch over, so it's, like, pretty easy to do it.
00:16:02.024 - 00:16:41.094, Speaker B: And then, yeah, I guess for, like, people that aren't super familiar with me on ETH, it's very mature on ethanol. So you've probably heard of flashbots. Flashbots released Mev Geth back when it was doing proof of work. Now there's mev boost. So 91% of Ethereum blocks are produced by Mevboost. This is like a kind of a chart of, like, the Lido APY and all the purple stuff is the mev, like, rewards. So you can see that, like, mev rewards are increasing APY by 20%.
00:16:41.094 - 00:17:18.550, Speaker B: And then, like, if you look at what happened during the USDC deep, it was like, there was a lot of the rewards were increased by, like, over 100% during those few days. And then. Yeah, like, the. It's. It's very mature on Ethereum, and then it's also very efficient. So I think according to Flashbots website, there's, like, less than 1% of gas, which is, like, Solana's compute unit equivalent is used for me, where, like, you know, on Solana, it's, like 58%. So it's a very mature ecosystem.
00:17:18.550 - 00:17:43.324, Speaker B: Like, we know that this is possible. Flashbots is, like, leading the way for this on Ethereum. We're leading the way for this on Solana. Like, I think we know it's possible. Um, and we're like, I'd love to see the community support this. Um, so, yeah, like, the main thing that, uh, validators can do is run Gita. Solana takes less than five minutes.
00:17:43.324 - 00:18:26.108, Speaker B: There's, like, validators, like, super small validators to, like, institutions that are running this super easy to switch over. The main setup differences are that you have to build from source, which you should do anyway for normal Solana. And then there's, like, five new command line arguments that you have to add. So that's just kind of like, you know, there's different parameters associated with Mev. We have a setup guide linked here that you can run through as well. And then, yeah, we'll share the stack after the presentation, links to our website, documentation, how to set it up. If you're interested in running it, definitely join our discord.
00:18:26.108 - 00:18:45.744, Speaker B: There's. We're here to help. There's like, 80 other validators that will help as well. And then, yeah, you can contact Brian via Twitter or email or tag him in discord. Cool. That's all I had. Let me see if there's any questions here.
00:18:45.744 - 00:19:15.354, Speaker B: See, I'll answer overclock first and then Brian. Brian Cole, and then Brian Long. So, yeah, spamming. I guess spamming is helpful because there's no, like, guaranteed ordering mechanism on Solana. And Lana's not the only one that has this, like, polygon. There's a huge spam problem. Ethereum had a huge spam problem before flashbots.
00:19:15.354 - 00:20:20.824, Speaker B: And what you saw is like, people would bid up the, they call them priority gas auctions or PGA, and you can bid up the gas on transactions. So what happened on Ethereum, or just like, any system is that people will, like, if they have a goal to order transactions, they will find the best way to do that and, like, push it to the max until it becomes, like, until it's not profitable anymore. Like, on Solana, there's basically around ethereum is like priority gas auctions, where people just keep resending their transaction to the mempool with, like, one gas higher than the previous one. On Solana, it's like kind of a combination of, like, priority fees and, like, sending more transactions. Oh, yeah, we're going to validate or see what other nodes are running gas. Solana. Yeah, Brian, can you maybe share a link for that in the chat and then we can add it? I think it's on the documentation as well.
00:20:20.824 - 00:20:22.224, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks.
00:20:22.844 - 00:20:51.704, Speaker F: I was just thinking, for your cold start and adoption question, it could be good to effectively decentralize that. If you can go on validators app or Solana beach or any of the other validators. And see, here's the pie chart of all validators that are running jitto, right. Then instead of anyone needing to come to you necessarily, right. They can be like, oh, my buddy's running judo. I didn't realize it. Let me talk to him and get an easier, more trusted on rev flavor.
00:20:52.244 - 00:21:14.434, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, there's some good talk in the chat validators that you can filter by cheetah validators. Many steak. And then I think there's a few others working on it. All the information is, like, available on chain and, like, decentralized. So you can actually look on chain and see who's running it. It's just like a PDA that's derived.
00:21:14.434 - 00:21:29.934, Speaker B: So, yeah, you can, there's more, doc, there's more info in the documentation there. Thanks. Okay. Brian Cole. I think it's Brian Cole. Brian Long. And then, yeah, so if I'm just.
00:21:29.974 - 00:21:37.994, Speaker G: Starting out and I have, like, the foundation allegations. So it's like 50,000 solar whatever. Is it still worth using the Jito client?
00:21:38.734 - 00:22:07.614, Speaker B: Uh, yeah, so there's the, there's like no performance hit by running the Jito client. It's like 99% of code in there is still on the labs, and there's a one to one release between the two. Um, so, yeah, I think it's still worth it. And I think that it's just like another differentiator compared to others that maybe aren't running this. Like, there have been some validators. I've seen more stake in flow from running the client. So.
00:22:08.114 - 00:22:08.970, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:22:09.162 - 00:22:13.054, Speaker B: Cool. Thank you. Yeah. Brian Long.
00:22:14.794 - 00:22:48.290, Speaker D: Yeah. So on this problem of people kind of maybe maliciously trying to hit an account. Right. Max. I can even give some people maybe just a relative look at this right now. In the last 1 hour on blocklogic validator, I dropped 213,000 transactions because it would either exceed the block max or the account x. So 213,000 total, 73,500 were block max.
00:22:48.290 - 00:23:02.484, Speaker D: So we had hit the block cu threshold. The remainder then just about 140,000 was hitting the account Max. How can Jitto solve that problem?
00:23:03.904 - 00:23:41.542, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think a lot of the problems are related to MeV. So, like, you're seeing basically it's like cheaper for the transaction tax. Cute. Fully. And then revert versus, like, failing in the beginning. And you're seeing a lot of traders just take write locks and try to do stuff and then revert. And so, like, by basically we give traders, like, a system that will basically pre simulate everything ahead of time, and then it will only execute stuff that succeeds and pays the most.
00:23:41.542 - 00:23:59.354, Speaker B: And it's a guaranteed ordering mechanism. So by, like, giving people a guaranteed ordering mechanism and then, like, simulating that stuff ahead of time before it hits the validator, it kind of, you know, takes some of the load off the cluster from the people that are, like, wasting the compute units.
00:24:00.414 - 00:24:04.510, Speaker D: Yeah, but potentially we still have it if they're not using cheeto bundles.
00:24:04.582 - 00:24:07.274, Speaker B: Right. So, yeah, yeah.
00:24:08.774 - 00:24:09.422, Speaker E: Okay.
00:24:09.518 - 00:24:15.674, Speaker D: That's where I think the priority fees probably need to fix that problem, but I'll let anatoly take the floor.
00:24:17.994 - 00:24:27.854, Speaker C: Um, how does this kind of interact, what you think with, like, the write lock fees that mango guys are working?
00:24:29.354 - 00:25:04.314, Speaker B: Um, I think that they're, like, pretty, there's definitely, like, a little overlap, but I think that the way that I think about the application. Right, lock fee, this isn't like a one to one, but it's kind of like a application base fee. Um, so I think that the stuff that they're working on will definitely help to reduce the load on the cluster for manga, and then the stuff that we're working on is just like another layer on top to reduce the, like, amount of stuff that's taking write locks.
00:25:06.534 - 00:25:13.974, Speaker C: Um, why do you think people are spamming with so many transactions instead of bumping their fee still?
00:25:15.674 - 00:25:49.634, Speaker B: Because the, I think it the ordering mechanism and banking stage where, like, each, each thread has its own kind of priority. And then there, I just think, I guess without getting, like, too in the weeds, I think it has to do with probably. Probably the way that banking stage, like, orders transactions, and then the fact that, like, if you have more transactions sitting in the queue, there's a higher probability that you might get processed first.
00:25:51.254 - 00:26:04.344, Speaker H: If I may comment on this a little bit as well, you have someone that's on the searcher side and the validator side. The priority is not synchronized across the banking threads in the banking stage.
00:26:04.424 - 00:26:04.664, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:04.704 - 00:26:26.920, Speaker H: And, like, we've seen this kind of in real time, like, I can submit ten transactions all at once, all with different priority fees. And the order I see them land in the block is often quite different from the ordering that you would expect from the priority fees. Additionally, I think a lot of searchers don't always know why their transactions are getting dropped.
00:26:27.032 - 00:26:27.256, Speaker E: Right.
00:26:27.280 - 00:26:54.868, Speaker H: There's a lot of reasons and a lot of randomness and a lot of jitter in terms of, like, why transactions might get dropped. So it's often just, it's, you have some probability of, like, this transaction is going to get dropped. It probably just makes sense to spam that a few times and hope at least one of them gets through. So I'd say, like, that, like, they're not knowing why transactions get dropped, as well as the lack of synchronization of priority fees across banking threads would probably be the main two reasons contributing to spam.
00:26:54.916 - 00:26:55.504, Speaker B: Here.
00:26:56.124 - 00:26:56.756, Speaker C: Got it.
00:26:56.820 - 00:26:57.544, Speaker E: Okay.
00:27:00.064 - 00:27:04.724, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks. Ben, answer your question? Ancillary.
00:27:05.624 - 00:27:06.256, Speaker E: Yep.
00:27:06.360 - 00:27:08.684, Speaker C: Yeah, that's pretty good. On site.
00:27:13.304 - 00:27:15.204, Speaker B: Yeah. Chris, do you have a question?
00:27:16.704 - 00:27:27.384, Speaker E: Yeah, thanks. I was wondering, are you seeing any significant impact of latency on performance right now, meaning latency between validators and clusters, the judo clusters.
00:27:30.044 - 00:27:34.144, Speaker B: Latency as far as, like, sending trades or.
00:27:34.804 - 00:27:55.794, Speaker E: Well, for example, you know, we were talking earlier, you know, we're in Madrid right now, and I think the closest Cheeto cluster is Frankfurt. So is it better, from a performance perspective to be co located in Frankfurt, or is Madrid? Okay, based on what you're seeing so far, I was curious if you have any empirical evidence right now based on what you've seen so far.
00:27:56.334 - 00:28:37.744, Speaker B: Yeah, we're seeing, like, 100% success rate today. Like, on or not? Not 100%, but very close to 100% on machines, like, anywhere they are. I think closer will be better, but I want to, like, avoid. Like, people shouldn't move to these locations, like, just to get what they think will be, like, a noticeable improvement. We would like to, like, we don't want to end up with more stake in Frankfurt or Amsterdam. So, like, if. If you want to see block engine set up in more locations, please let us know.
00:28:37.744 - 00:28:55.734, Speaker B: You know, we're also focused on a lot of reliability efforts right now after, like, expanding pretty fast. So that's, like, been a main focus for us for q one, but q two, it's going to kind of go back into, like, a little more growth mode, and, like, you know, we could definitely set up something in Madrid.
00:28:57.674 - 00:28:58.734, Speaker E: Okay, thanks.
00:29:04.674 - 00:29:22.616, Speaker B: Sweet. Is there any more questions given through the chat? Feel free to speak up if there's anything. Yeah, Brian? Yeah.
00:29:22.640 - 00:29:28.164, Speaker G: At what point does this make sense to roll into this Lana client?
00:29:29.544 - 00:30:00.912, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. So this is something that we'll probably focus on. Probably, like, end of q two or q three. Like, how do we. You know, Geyser was an amazing addition with, like, adding support for custom plugins. I think that this is, like, another. It's kind of, like, an interesting shift in the way that you can think about making modifications to a validator.
00:30:00.912 - 00:30:21.204, Speaker B: That's something that we're exploring as well. Like, how do we make. How do we get rid of Jito Solana and turn it into, like, the Jito plugin? And then, like, what. What hooks do we need to add into the validator to do that? And then also, like, as fired answers quickly approaching, like, how do we hook into fire dancer as well through a plugin?
00:30:22.664 - 00:30:36.188, Speaker G: And how do you, like, still keep your identity? Because if it does get absorbed to Solana, then you won't have the judo client anymore. But then that kind of would hurt you, I think, as a company. So was there something um, yeah, I.
00:30:36.196 - 00:31:28.250, Speaker B: Mean, I think, like, uh, Jito is kind of like a SaaS company. So, like, most of the, the, uh, most of the, like, service and value add is on the block engine side. So, like, you know, making sure that we're sending the most profitable trades to validators and, like, doing the best we can to reduce spam. Um, so it's definitely a good point, but I'm not super concerned about it. I think, like, the easier it is for people to onboard, like, I guess building the client from source is like, can be like kind of a big learning curve for some people versus just like, downloading it. So if we can make it a plugin and make it super easy to install for anyone independent of, like, whether they're running the labs, client, or fire dancer, then it makes it the reach of it way larger. Awesome.
00:31:28.250 - 00:31:29.134, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:31:29.754 - 00:31:30.534, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:31:36.274 - 00:31:57.180, Speaker B: So, yeah, it looks like we're running up on time. I'll hand it back to Tim. We'll share this presentation afterwards, and definitely feel free to stop by discord. We're happy to help. There's a lot of other, like, really good validators in there as well that are willing to help. So thanks for the time, Tim, and everyone else. Cool.
00:31:57.212 - 00:32:16.858, Speaker A: Thank you, Lucas. Thank you. Judo. Really good conversation. I appreciate it. I want to bring up, well, I guess open up the floor for open q and a. There was a question in MB validators right before we started about another call that Chris from chainflow and Max are organizing.
00:32:16.858 - 00:32:24.914, Speaker A: So maybe you want to give them a chance to just talk about it for a minute if you're willing and kind of differentiated a little bit.
00:32:27.854 - 00:32:54.534, Speaker E: Yeah, I can take a shot. Tim and I spoke last week, and, you know, we had the call that Maxims organized, and he has a lot of really good participation from a lot of different people after the avid change back in February. And there are a number of to dos that came out of that as well. I see fixed mic. Can you guys hear me okay?
00:32:55.274 - 00:32:57.854, Speaker A: It's a little staticky. Hard to hear.
00:32:58.834 - 00:33:17.554, Speaker E: Sorry. Is Max on? Otherwise I can take a minute to try and go for quieter or with better acoustics. Yeah, Max. Dad, do you have something else to go through and I'll try and find it better? Please do talk from.
00:33:18.654 - 00:34:08.808, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. Maybe I could give a little background. So there was a community run post mortem after the outage validators got together and just sort of hashed out what they could do better during a restart. And at first, I think my initial reaction was, why don't we just have this during this call, because it's a community call where validators should feel empowered to take over and, you know, propose topics to talk about. But after joining that call, I feel like it does actually have a lot of value for validators to sort of self organize and follow up on topics that I think are useful to them, that are maybe, maybe get lost easily in these calls. And for whatever reason, maybe there's some sentiment that people don't want to speak up as much in this call. I don't know if that's true or not.
00:34:08.808 - 00:34:33.036, Speaker A: But anyway, I've talked with Chris about it. I think it'd be great to have maybe a monthly call. I think that's what Chris is thinking about, to talk about issues that you all want to work on and maybe organize a little bit around, like initiatives that Chris and the rest of you highlighted in the last call. So that's kind of the background. I don't know if Chris's mic is.
00:34:33.060 - 00:34:35.304, Speaker E: Back or not back. Is this better?
00:34:35.964 - 00:34:39.384, Speaker A: About the same, but yeah, I can hear you.
00:34:40.804 - 00:35:12.122, Speaker E: Yeah. Well, I guess quickly. Yeah, I guess we'll start with the market call. The initial focus will be on following up on the different views that came out of the postmortem. But then we've also had people suggesting other topics. I mean, the beta validators channels that we can talk about, too, like a minimum fee proposal, mitigating DDoS attacks and things like this. So over time, you know, we can focus on the follow up, I think, to keep it interesting and to keep people engaged and coming back.
00:35:12.122 - 00:35:52.494, Speaker E: We can also maybe pick another topic to discuss as well and, you know, maybe take some of the conversation or at least supplement. Some of the conversations can happen in a different discord channel, be able to have a persistent place and follow up with some notes and turn it into something that could be actionable, because there's a lot of good conversation that happens in the channels because everybody being as busy as we are, sometimes things fade away. Chance for us to catch some of those things, too, and turn them into something as well along the way. So it's fully intended to be a supplement to these calls and placement, and anybody would like to join and is able to join, please do.
00:35:56.514 - 00:35:56.938, Speaker B: Cool.
00:35:56.986 - 00:36:42.384, Speaker A: Thank you, Chris. A little hard to hear, but I hope everyone got the gist of that. Essentially, the call will be supplemental to this call. The idea is to follow up on things that are initiatives by validators, for validators that you all want to work on or talk about. And, yeah, one other plug for this call, I guess, is the intention of this call is to be open to everyone. So if you're interested in talking about a topic, if you want to propose a topic or you want to present something, please, please don't feel shy about reaching out to me or just mentioning it, and then be validators. The agenda for this is open, and if anybody has suggestions for ways to make it feel more open for contributions, let me know.
00:36:42.384 - 00:36:44.864, Speaker A: That's the goal of this ultimately.
00:36:46.284 - 00:36:47.044, Speaker B: Cool.
00:36:47.204 - 00:36:48.904, Speaker A: Any other thoughts, questions?
00:36:52.484 - 00:36:53.664, Speaker B: I got a quick comment.
00:36:54.124 - 00:36:56.504, Speaker F: Otherwise done. Go ahead, Max.
00:36:57.124 - 00:36:57.932, Speaker B: I was just gonna say, I hope.
00:36:57.948 - 00:36:58.532, Speaker G: You guys can hear me.
00:36:58.548 - 00:37:26.730, Speaker B: Okay. By the way, yeah? I put a poll, a doodle poll in the, in the discord today just to try and find the least bad time for us to meet. So far, only Wayne and Zantetsu have responded, but I only put options for, like, next week. So it'll probably be a weekday next week, but I'll definitely try and circulate around like, you know, what date is ahead of time because, yeah, we certainly don't want to have it feel like a closed call or closed session or anything like that.
00:37:26.922 - 00:37:27.370, Speaker D: But, yeah.
00:37:27.402 - 00:37:30.894, Speaker B: Thanks. Thanks, Tim, for the support. Yeah.
00:37:37.834 - 00:37:38.974, Speaker A: Dan Jackson.
00:37:39.534 - 00:38:36.204, Speaker F: Oh, yeah. I was actually just going to make a quick plug for this role opening that I've talked with a couple of folks here, so apologies for shameless plug, but I wanted to let folks know I just pasted a link in the chat. Solana foundation is hiring for a head of staking ecosystem role. A lot of folks here, like our engaged validators, our stake cooperators, people touching the infra. The tools are, I think, the people with kind of the most buy in around, like Solana Foundation's position as to our delegation program, our delegation strategies, how we're supporting stake pools, and a lot of things that we're really planning on evolving over the near term. And so just wanted to let you guys know if anyone here or you know of anyone in your network that you think would be like, a good and passionate candidate to sort of help drive a lot of this stuff on behalf of Solana foundation, we are all ears.
00:38:45.664 - 00:38:46.240, Speaker B: All right.
00:38:46.312 - 00:38:50.472, Speaker A: There are no other questions or thoughts. Oh, Brian, go ahead.
00:38:50.648 - 00:38:51.048, Speaker E: Sorry.
00:38:51.096 - 00:38:52.328, Speaker G: Lots of questions today.
00:38:52.496 - 00:38:54.284, Speaker A: Yeah, good discussion.
00:38:54.824 - 00:39:18.114, Speaker G: Do you have any updates on onboarding process? Because I know since the outage and transitioning back to 113, everything's been a bit paused. Any particular updates on that and whether there might be some changes to any prioritized validators who are on the waitlist and maybe are participating more or anything of that nature?
00:39:19.174 - 00:40:08.768, Speaker A: There's no changes right now to the onboarding process, but it's always something we're thinking about. As far as the sort of lack of onboarding lately there's been a number of sort of issues that we've been investigating and making onboarding something that we're just not comfortable with. But I've yet to announce it this week we are onboarding 25. And I think week to week it's always essentially the process is every week we review metrics, we look at how the network's doing, check if there's anything that needs to be investigated and assuming that those investigations are not too concerning to engineers, then we onboard another 25. So I can't really say that every week we're going to be onboarding 25 from here on out, but that's, that's the plan unless there's an issue, of course.
00:40:08.816 - 00:40:18.920, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes total sense. Thank you. Yeah. All right.
00:40:19.112 - 00:40:22.124, Speaker A: Great discussion. Thank you, everybody. And happy birthday, Solana.
00:40:24.404 - 00:40:25.044, Speaker F: Thanks, everybody.
