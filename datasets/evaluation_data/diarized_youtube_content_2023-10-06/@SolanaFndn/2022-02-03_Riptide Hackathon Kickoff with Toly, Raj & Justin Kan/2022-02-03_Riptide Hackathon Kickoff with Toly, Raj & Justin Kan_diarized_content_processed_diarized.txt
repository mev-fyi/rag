00:00:00.680 - 00:00:19.314, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Welcome. So want to first welcome Justin Khan, who is the founder of this, one of the founders of this website. What's up, guys?
00:00:19.734 - 00:00:28.034, Speaker B: Anatoly. Raj, thanks for having me at this kickoff. This is super exciting. Is this the biggest hackathon you guys have done so far?
00:00:29.024 - 00:00:32.728, Speaker A: This is the biggest one, yeah.
00:00:32.856 - 00:01:18.324, Speaker C: The first heck of them we ever had was November. What was it, 2020? I think, like 40 teams formed. And the last one a year later, there were 580 teams, I think, that formed. And I think almost 100 of them got their seed funding before the hackathon finished. So, yeah, this is the next one that we're throwing since the ignition hackathon in November of 2021. And I think we're probably expecting more than that, 580 teams to end up forming. So it's super exciting.
00:01:19.304 - 00:01:19.760, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:01:19.792 - 00:01:50.154, Speaker A: Yeah, we literally, the first one, that was about a year and three months ago, there were maybe 100 teams that, like, showed up. 14 of them built something. And the one before this, we had more teams that actually finished and built a product than all the previous hackathons combined, over 500. So I want to see, like, a thousand people actually take that plunge and, like, start the journey to being a founder.
00:01:51.074 - 00:02:01.694, Speaker B: Amazing. So, like, there's a lot of people who are building real companies that are coming out of this. What are some notable past examples of some of the projects that got started through hackathon?
00:02:02.594 - 00:02:37.414, Speaker A: I mean, some of the biggest projects on Solana, like Mango, Sabre, those are hackathon projects, psyoptions, katana, which was one of the winners. You see folks go into, like, a hackathon, start building a product, and we started noticing that they were getting funding even before the hackathon was finished. So, and, you know, we had, like, a ventures team that was trying to get into those deals, and it was like, too late.
00:02:41.274 - 00:02:48.988, Speaker B: This time. You got to come in with the money gun up front and just, well, that's incredible.
00:02:49.156 - 00:03:16.988, Speaker A: Yeah, we're lucky that we don't have to be that, like, the biggest venture like we thought. You know, we don't need to be that big venture team. There's enough investors that are investing in Solana. That is just awesome that we see this ecosystem growing, not just from the developer perspective, but from people looking into the space and making these big bets on the future, what the future crypto is going to be like, what the future of the web is going to look like, 100%.
00:03:17.076 - 00:03:39.904, Speaker B: And I feel like there's a lot of energy. My experience, I've just been in the Solana ecosystem for the last couple of months. But there's this huge amount of energy of people building stuff, which is really what's exciting for me. What are some of the things that you want to see people try to build? I know there's a request for startups page, but walk people through some of the stuff that you're excited to see them take a stab at.
00:03:42.944 - 00:04:36.684, Speaker A: My personal I think ideas are that it's time for, I mean, people. I think it's also time for people to do very basic things like can you build a Venmo competitor? Can you build a very basic application that just has payments, but it's fully crypto, and really focus on the user experience and nail that idea that crypto can be simple for people to understand and use, but also still have self custody and that true ownership of digital assets. If you can do that, I think this is where you can start making the magic happen. You've solved a real world use case, it's still full crypto, still full self custody, and now it's growing like crazy. So that's what I'm excited about. I don't know, Raj, what do you think? Thinking about?
00:04:37.224 - 00:05:22.440, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, just building up the payments thing. Like Visa is involved with this hackathon and they're sponsoring the payments track. And a lot of you may have seen the news yesterday that Solanapay just launched. So it's basically an open, permissionless, super fast, super cheap payments protocol. Any merchants can spin up QR codes for any transaction and it's a lot of transaction fees. So it's like $25 for a million transactions. So I think what we expect to see is maybe it's Venmo, maybe it's something else, but all the, whatever, 2.75%
00:05:22.440 - 00:06:59.564, Speaker C: to 3% transaction fees that used to go to payment processors are up for grabs in the payment flow to create loyalty programs, viral growth loops, or just finance maybe nfts, and create packages for merchants to make themselves more sticky. So that's a whole track. Outside of that, I think gaming, there's so much to do there. And Justin, I know you guys with Fractal have been engaging a ton with gaming teams, but I think what we've been seeing is like everything from open source, free to play games that might have been created as libraries, getting reskinned and getting their economy swapped out for crypto tokens and their in game assets swapped out for nfts, you can get that stuff off the ground really fast. And I think it's just a matter of time before we see an explosion of those free to play games, getting converted into play to earn games. And then I think one of our winners in our past hackathons was Defi Land, which is creating a really delightful browser game experience on top of Defi. So making yield farming into actual farming and.
00:06:59.564 - 00:07:17.164, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think that track is sponsored. Who is it? I think Samsung sponsored that one. So, yeah, there's a lot of killer mentors and companies involved, and they'll be watching for the output of these projects.
00:07:18.604 - 00:07:26.224, Speaker B: Tell us about some of the other tracks. What are the different tracks that are in the hackathon this year?
00:07:27.244 - 00:08:17.414, Speaker C: Yeah, so the other gaming sponsor is TSM, the esports company. And between Samsung and TSM in gaming, the first prize is $50,000. 2nd prize is thirty k, and then twenty five k, fifteen k, ten k. So five prizes for gaming. There's also, as I just mentioned, the payments track sponsored by Visa. First prize there is fifty k, and then the same price tiers, five different prizes in Defi jump. Crypto, which is the crypto subsidiary of the major market making and trading firm, is sponsoring the DeFi category.
00:08:17.414 - 00:09:06.993, Speaker C: And obviously FTX and serum and all the past defi winners like Sabre are all involved in this hackathon psyoptions as well. They're all judges and mentors, and the projects they built ultimately became their businesses and their jobs. And you can talk to them about how much they love their life. Now there's also the web3 track sponsored by Google. Again, five prize categories. And in that track we'll be looking at social media alternatives and things like audius that focus on music. And then the last track is Daos.
00:09:06.993 - 00:09:57.934, Speaker C: So pretty nascent category. I think this is a year where we expect to see probably five to 10,000 new daos get created, just like last year. By the time half the year had gone by, there were basically no NFT projects on Solana. And then with the launch of Metaplex, today there's 75,000 NFT projects on Solana, probably a dozen secondary NFT marketplaces. I think we expect to see that same kind of boom happen in Daos. And there are Dao platforms like Tribeca, which is built by, I think the saber guys helped out with that one. And we also have realms in the Solana program library, so a lot of code bases you can get started with to launch DaO infrastructure.
00:09:57.934 - 00:10:19.484, Speaker C: And the Dao's track is sponsored by Monkey Dao, which is the Dao behind the Solana monkey business, NFT project, which is the biggest one on Solana. And then also Mango Dao, which is the protocol, Dao for mango markets, which is a decentralized exchange on Solana.
00:10:20.984 - 00:10:37.794, Speaker B: Amazing. I'm super excited about the possibility of Daos and creating these new digital natives, forms of human organization. I feel like that's the next. We haven't seen that much innovation there since people invented the joint stock corporation, like 400 something years ago.
00:10:38.694 - 00:10:57.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's mind blowing how powerful this thing can get. I'm pretty sure that 100 million people through a Dow will buy every coal plant and shut them down. That's how we're going to actually solve climate change. It's just through direct action via doubt.
00:10:59.374 - 00:11:19.474, Speaker B: That's so cool. If you can buy a sports team, why not? This is like, way, you know, way higher stakes. So let's see, what else. How do people get started with the hackathon? Like, what's the, you know, we're kicking it off. What's your, what's the instruction of people for how to get started?
00:11:19.854 - 00:11:50.748, Speaker C: Yeah, everything. Everything you need should be@solana.com. Riptide. Because that's the name of the hackathon, is riptide. If you go there, I think probably the first thing that I would do is jump into discord, especially if you don't already have an idea or a team. Part of the beauty of crypto right now is it's like Internet in the late nineties or the web two boom. It's all about community.
00:11:50.748 - 00:12:05.914, Speaker C: It's about people coming together, sharing ideas and forming teams and complementing each other's skill sets. And then, I don't know, totally, like, do you have any advice for folks that are jumping in for the first time?
00:12:06.534 - 00:12:35.002, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, read the resources. Solana cookbook. Start playing around with anchor as you're building a program. So there's an anchor discord, and that's basically the fastest way to build Solana smart contract. I wrote my first anchor program about a month ago, and I think it's something that would have taken me, like, two weeks to build. I was able to build in 4 hours. So it's pretty awesome.
00:12:35.002 - 00:12:52.778, Speaker A: It's just like, does everything that you want and, yeah, read the docs. It's Rust. Learn. Rust is a wonderful community on its own. It's one of the most loved programming languages out there. So go talk to some rust folks. If you get stuck, they're super friendly to beginners.
00:12:52.778 - 00:13:40.230, Speaker A: If you have beginner questions, all the Rust discord basically will answer your. I still go there and ask, like, why? Why am I getting this compiler error. So, yeah, it's a great community. So, yeah, start coding and start thinking about, like, what is an application that you imagine is going to be popular or, like, used by many people once crypto gets to this, like, scale of adoption of 100 million users, or a billion users, actually billion users with self custody. If you can think of those things now, you should start building them now, because it takes about five years. Five years to build a company, five years to really reach that mature level of success. And I firmly believe within five years, we're going to get to that mass adoption stage.
00:13:40.230 - 00:13:42.954, Speaker A: We're going to have a billion people with self custody.
00:13:46.314 - 00:14:33.658, Speaker B: Everything's being rewritten right through the lens of ownership and distributed, distributed ownership, or decentralized ownership. And so there's probably the opportunity to rethink everything that's been created in web two or on the Internet so far. Like, how will it exist in this new world? And, I mean, that's pretty exciting. I'm self interested in inspiring more gaming, gaming companies to get created because we launched fractal a month ago on the Solana blockchain and as a secondary marketplace and now a primary minting launchpad for game companies. And it's been really cool to see how many people are just, like, kind of rewriting the economics of games and trying different slices, different flavors, and doing it on Solana, it's like, there's so much. There's a. For everything.
00:14:33.658 - 00:14:40.854, Speaker B: Like, one project you've seen launch, there's, like, ten more that are in development right now. And that's really exciting and exciting to be part of.
00:14:42.284 - 00:14:51.652, Speaker C: Yeah. I actually am excited for you guys on the fractal team to go check out. I think you guys are going into one of the hacker houses soon, right?
00:14:51.788 - 00:15:07.384, Speaker B: Yes. I'll be down to the LA hacker house tomorrow afternoon, like five ish. I don't know. So if you're down there, I'll see you tomorrow. Should be pretty cool. Seems like you got a pretty cool space for it. Tell us about the hacker houses.
00:15:08.134 - 00:15:20.126, Speaker C: Yeah, we. So Bartosz and Jordan, who are two product engineers on Solana Labs, they're really awesome. If you ever get to meet them. Yeah.
00:15:20.190 - 00:15:25.422, Speaker B: Shout out Bartosz. He's, like, amazing and helped us out with fractal a lot, so thank you. Thanks.
00:15:25.478 - 00:16:08.104, Speaker C: Yeah, he's super awesome. They're there in LA, I think. Really? The first hacker house was in, in November at breakpoint in Lisbon. I don't think I even really knew that it was happening, but we got there and it turned out that Bartosz had gotten this house and filled it up with monitors and just started bringing all the devs there to avoid all the conference stuff and just start, just pack away. And I think at some point, there were whiteboards up and people were putting out bounties. And somebody was just like, here's a requirement. I'll send you $100,000 in USDC on Phantom.
00:16:08.104 - 00:16:37.646, Speaker C: If you get this done. Somebody across the room is just like, all right, I'll do it. So it's really kind of like a frenzy of development activity and mentorship. And so we decided, let's roll this into a global series of events. So right now, the La hacker house is going, pretty epic venue. I'll see if I can pull up some pictures. But they're all over Twitter.
00:16:37.646 - 00:17:36.009, Speaker C: And then they're moving to Seattle and then Dubai and then Singapore, Moscow and Hong Kong and then Prague. So all these hacker houses are going to be going during the, during the hackathon. And if you're in any of these regions, definitely you should go to Solana.com events to see the schedule and register and go check it out, see what the vibe of the Solana community is like. And then I'm not sure if we have a really great link for it right now. But there's also other community run hacker houses like Mountain Dow near Salt Lake City, which is just like a mountain house full of devs that are hacking away right now. And so I think somewhere on the website, actually, there's a submit event button on the events page.
00:17:36.009 - 00:17:42.373, Speaker C: So if you click there, if you want to go and set up your own hacker house, the Solana foundation will help with that.
00:17:44.033 - 00:18:01.984, Speaker B: Awesome. That's so cool. Like, you're really bringing community around in all these different global cities. That's pretty fun. Um, all right, what else, what else should we talk about? What else is going on with, with the hackathon?
00:18:02.844 - 00:18:16.824, Speaker A: What do you want to see? Like, what would you want to see as someone who's seen, like, social grow up and web two? What would you like to see in, like, web3 and, like, the kind of approaches people should be thinking about?
00:18:17.444 - 00:19:23.034, Speaker B: Well, I think that whats most powerful to me, I was never super interested in the defi side. Its not my primary interest. But whats really been interesting to me and what made me want to jump into crypto in the last, starting about a year ago, was I think now you can build these real interesting consumer applications. I was an advisor to the audience project early on. They actually started out of my years ago, I seeing them work at launch an app that's like a functional high transaction volume app that's built on top of crypto that distributes the ownership. And it was pretty inspiring to me. And so I think I've talked to friends of mine and I say if twitch was being created today, it'd be a decentralized project because you have this community that's making the app like making the market of content and viewers and there should be some reward for the people who are participating to like participate in the economic upside and control and governance of that platform.
00:19:23.034 - 00:20:31.584, Speaker B: And I mean, that's how the Internet should work, right? So I'm interested in like how can you apply that idea to like everything that's in web two? Like every market, you know, every, you know, every game, like with these games, like, you have games that are like doing billions of dollars of revenue where people are just buying stuff that they don't really own, right? Theyre effectively renting all the things inside games. And I think the next wave is clearly going to be blockchain gaming where people have some ownership of the things that they buy and earn inside of games. And then the games realize that by opening their set of nfts up to be this open programmable economy, its actually good for them. When you make your thing a platform and people actually build on top of it, its cool and create all these downstream experiences that people have never even anticipated. I guess I'm primarily interested in the social and gaming aspect of it. And I think it's kind of like I'm most interested in the things that I don't even like, know to invent. You know, I think like when you make all this stuff open, programmable and owned by the community, there's going to be like people are going to invent all sorts of experiences that you never thought would exist before.
00:20:34.604 - 00:21:15.734, Speaker A: Yeah, what I've been dreaming about is like, like if game plat, if games became kind of their own platforms for expression, for art, you know, like we're all NPC's and somebody else's quest because it'd be a lot more fun to play a game where you're interacting with people that are actors, right, that are like actually, you know, interactive with you and trying to like move you along in the storyline. And I don't know when that's going to happen, but it feels like, I don't know, maybe, maybe within like five to ten years we'll get there. That the next generation games you're playing against like the community college, like a theater group.
00:21:19.794 - 00:21:21.458, Speaker B: I think that's. That's inevitable.
00:21:21.506 - 00:21:22.134, Speaker A: Stage.
00:21:23.634 - 00:21:41.814, Speaker B: That's inevitable. You know, as people spend more and more time, like in these digital spaces, like there's gonna, you know, it's kind of gonna be a replacement for the. For the, you know, for the world. Like people are going to. You're going to have all these experiences that are like curated by people who are like playing roles in them, you know. Excited about that?
00:21:47.994 - 00:21:48.774, Speaker A: Cool.
00:21:50.994 - 00:21:57.334, Speaker B: Go ahead, Anjali. No, I was just going to add like what else? What are some other ideas that you want to inspire people to build?
00:21:59.454 - 00:23:00.534, Speaker A: I think theres still a ton of stuff unexplored in Defi as well. I think people think that thats the most mature part of crypto. But I think what I started to realize is that as crypto grows, whats happening is that everything becomes defi. Art is defi through nfts. Gaming is defi through play to earn. And there's a lot of different ways to start building, even leveraging existing protocols and recombining them into higher level applications that not just. What I would love to see is people, folks step away from tokens and yield and start thinking about understanding how the stuff works with nfts, with our low liquidity assets and creating liquidity for those over the long run and start thinking about what are the economics behind those things and building those protocols.
00:23:00.534 - 00:23:52.434, Speaker A: It's really that if you succeed, you'll be like the Avi of that world. There's no big competitors in these other genres of defi. So I think if you're especially coming out of the, you know, traditional financial scene, out of, you know, some Chicago options trading firm, um, there's a lot of opportunities outside of like the core defi applications. But, um, you know, you know, my, my dream was that the Internet of money is going to be backed by nfTs. It's not bitcoin, it's not sol, it's not ETH, it's a pool, a basket of culture from which we mint a synthetic dollar. And that's the dollar that everyone uses. And that's the, that's the money of the Internet.
00:23:53.614 - 00:23:54.750, Speaker B: That's an awesome idea.
00:23:54.822 - 00:23:55.870, Speaker A: I love that.
00:23:56.062 - 00:24:06.434, Speaker B: I love that. It's like you can be backed by like Nancat, NFTs and memes and all sorts of just like cultural stuff. Apes love it.
00:24:07.254 - 00:24:16.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that would be the most entertaining outcome. Right. So that's the future you should maybe sometimes try to build. A hackathon is a great place to experiment on that.
00:24:18.964 - 00:24:22.904, Speaker B: How about you any things that you'd like to see people build?
00:24:24.364 - 00:25:28.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think so. Phantom Mobile just went live. And I think more than any specific product, I'd like to see people that are really optimizing for mobile interface building tools and, and marketplaces and interesting things to do with nfts on mobile. I think Solana is probably the best place in the world right now to be building mobile native NFT experiences. And the Phantom app is super slick. So if you go and really just test and iterate on the UX for something potentially really simple, you've got, I think, 70,000 people just downloaded the, the Phantom app like yesterday. So you've got a bunch of people with a brand new mobile app to browse their wallets, and anything that really gives them something cool to do that's super mobile native is going to be probably a really good hit.
00:25:28.194 - 00:26:24.634, Speaker C: And then we also have crowdsourced a bunch of project ideas from the judges and mentors in the hackathon. So if you go to Solana.com Riptide ideas, or you can click into it. If you go to the Riptide website and click ideas at the top, there's a bunch of project ideas in Daos and Defi and web3 and data and infrastructure. And then I'll also say, like, I guess specifically right now, discoverability and curation for, for applications built on Solana is a really big problem. It's just similar to the early App Store and the early Internet, where Yahoo was the main directory of websites. That stuff really still doesn't exist.
00:26:24.634 - 00:27:45.554, Speaker C: And the repo for Solana.com ecosystem is actually an open source repo that anybody can go and access. I think there's maybe close to 1000 projects that have actually registered and have a description and metadata and a pointer to their dapps within Solana.com ecosystem. But that's basically one or two people that have ever maintained that. And what I could expect to see is if you take that repo and go and decide to build the next product hunt for crypto or the next App Store, or a trust and safety layer using this index of Solana applications, where maybe you build a protocol for verification, what are the top ten or 20 Solana apps that should really have a verified check mark? What does that look like in this ecosystem? And how do you serve that as a product to Phantom and the other wallet interfaces? And how do you turn that logic for verification or fraud flagging over to users into a community? I think that's something that's really important. It's going to come up at some point.
00:27:45.554 - 00:27:59.874, Speaker C: Again, the ecosystem repo is open, so you can just go fork it. It's a beautiful UI. It's got a ranking and voting system for surfacing stuff and just go run with it.
00:28:01.174 - 00:28:16.314, Speaker B: Amazing. Does it, like, this is maybe too technical of a question, but does the Phantom app allow you to authenticate your wallet to another mobile app? Could I make another mobile app that through the Phantom mobile app?
00:28:17.814 - 00:28:47.374, Speaker C: I think right now it's all just. The only applications you can access are through the. The web view within the Phantom app. So you have to type in a URL for a web app that you want to access. And then I think it has a kind of memory function for different apps that you visited before, so you can easily go and tap around them again. But it's just web based.
00:28:48.674 - 00:29:08.454, Speaker B: I have this vision for Apple. Want to. I want to build like a. For fun, that's like an NFT project where if you have the NFT in your wallet, you can authenticate to this other app. And this app would let you control like a physical or project that I'm building for burning man. That's like my campus for fun. We're building like a physical art project.
00:29:08.454 - 00:29:21.394, Speaker B: And I can see you, like, you controlling it from an app and we can sell nfts to kind of fund. Well, we're funding it already, but, like, we don't want to donate the proceeds from like an NFT sale for it.
00:29:21.924 - 00:29:23.304, Speaker A: That's awesome, man.
00:29:23.844 - 00:29:55.224, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to be incredible. It's going to be a 60 foot long art car. That's a giant iceberg, like a synthwave iceberg with lasers that go 17 miles, 220,000 leds on it. And so imagine if you just pull out your mool phone, you connect to the. There'll be like a wlan, like, exposed, and you connect to the thing and then you can press a button. And, you know, if you have the NFT, you, like, I thought this app, you press a button, everything goes like blue or yellow or whatever color you want or whatever visualization you want.
00:29:55.564 - 00:29:59.904, Speaker A: That's awesome. That would totally work. Just wallet connect and just like. Yeah.
00:30:03.004 - 00:30:08.704, Speaker B: So, chad, if anyone wants to, you know, hack on something, like, hit me up.
00:30:10.604 - 00:30:17.180, Speaker A: Yeah, anything that you would work for. Burning man is another good hackathon topic. We'll put it to experiment.
00:30:17.292 - 00:30:25.464, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll make a new track. We'll make a six track or whatever. Justin khan is the sponsor. The burning man track.
00:30:26.324 - 00:30:27.464, Speaker A: I love it.
00:30:28.004 - 00:31:18.764, Speaker C: Nice. Yeah. I think an important note is a bunch of fully formed, funded teams and products came out of prior hackathons, but there's also community choice awards. So if you just even build something really fun that showcases a particular technical skill or your proficiency at building really delightful uis, even if it's not something you intend to turn into a big business, there's a lot of room for it. And then I think we've seen teams get kind of aqua hired from hackathons as well by existing Solana projects, and teams have kind of shown what they could build, and then they ended up merging into a different team afterward. So I would say, you know, yeah, whatever, whatever. Like, sparks joy is what people should build.
00:31:19.304 - 00:31:31.896, Speaker B: Yeah, just go build something. Right? Like, that's the fun. I mean, the fun part of this, it's like Wild west. Let's just, like, build something fun. That's, that's that you're going to have. It's going to put a smile on someone's face, for sure.
00:31:32.040 - 00:32:24.694, Speaker C: We've also seen people like, you know, I think I would say probably on average, it takes about two hackathons before somebody iterates to the right team and the right product to go take a big swing. Or they're just so integrated in the Solana community by that point, after around three or four months, and they've got a few code bases to point back to and say, here's what I built. Here's what I understand, that it's easy for them to get jobs within the ecosystem or find that complementary skillset of other teammates to go go full time, which I think that's the goal for me, is to get as many developers full time working in web3 as fast as possible. And Solana is the place to do it because you're not really scale or cost constrained on anything that you do.
00:32:25.314 - 00:32:38.534, Speaker A: Yeah, the mango markets team formed during the hackathon. These were folks that never knew each other prior to that build this amazing project that is one of the most successful ones on Solana.
00:32:39.394 - 00:32:53.058, Speaker C: Yeah, mango had an ido that was using a drop mechanism that they built. And in the deposit period, it went up to, I think, over $500 million.
00:32:53.226 - 00:32:58.418, Speaker A: Which is more than half the dollars on Solana at the time.
00:32:58.466 - 00:34:06.564, Speaker C: It was more than half of all the USDC that was in circulation on Solana went into their smart contract, and then in the withdrawal period, it came back down to like 70 million. But this is a team that had been working maybe for less than six months and formed and found each other and started in a Solana hackathon less than a year ago and ended with a $70 million treasury. And they're a critical part of the DeFi ecosystem on Solana. It's just incredible how fast teams can get off the ground if they really find their groove. And this is why we haven't really seen or spent a lot of time and effort on something like a Y combinator within crypto, because I think actually a ten week program is way too long. Actually, two weeks is plenty to try and get something out the door and even build a community around it and an audience and a brand and prove out a concept. And then six months is plenty of time to get two or three shots on goal.
00:34:06.564 - 00:35:19.645, Speaker C: So that's why we have this sort of quarterly hackathon cadence, to take whatever project or seed of an idea that you had and just sprint toward an outcome where the whole industry is going to be able to see what you built. We've got literally every major investor from Andreessen Horowitz and even folks that aren't on the website, like from sequoia, are paying attention and will be looking at the outputs, but also multicoin and paradigm and Sino Global. And I mean, just everybody, literally all the investors in the space and now all the veteran builders within Solana, too, are all. It's nice for them to just have one, you know, five or six day period to just look at everything. So I think that's kind of a motivating force for everyone to focus and just like have an artificial deadline to sprint toward. But yeah, you know, it's like whatever you can get get done in this hackathon and then start plotting your path to the next one, because there's always going to be another one around the corner to just evolve toward, now's the.
00:35:19.669 - 00:35:28.264, Speaker B: Time to go build something. It's like investors are there, energy's there, the ideas are there. What excuse do you have?
00:35:29.644 - 00:36:14.952, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. What was kind of cool to see, like, during the early days, is that a lot of the teams that tried to build something in those first two hackathons ended up following through and trying it again in the third one and actually succeeding them at that time. So, like, don't even, don't think about it. As you know, there's always going to be another hackathon. So this is both a learning opportunity, a way to get started, a way to meet investors, talk to them the first time, and we have a lot of folks on our team that are happy to kind of coach you through that first raise or whatever it is that you need to do to get a company off the ground. So reach out.
00:36:14.952 - 00:36:16.844, Speaker A: We got a ton of resources.
00:36:18.984 - 00:36:48.064, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, should we close it up? Any final thoughts on sounds like there's a ton of resources to get started. People should check out the discord if they want to join a team and find a team. Visit the hacker houses. There's a schedule of the hacker houses up on the website on solana.com events. I think you mentioned anything else I'm missing there.
00:36:48.964 - 00:37:19.144, Speaker C: I think that's it. If you want to build using the new Solana Pay standard and protocol, you can go to solanapay.com or I think Solana. Yeah, actually from there you can reach the developer site with all the resources and the GitHub. So yeah, Solanapay.com dot and open source your projects. So I think it may be a little scary to do that.
00:37:19.144 - 00:38:01.920, Speaker C: But I remember in the early days of Solana, Tully was like, first line of code, go open source. And all the discussion in the open on Discord. And I think for folks that are used to building closed source web, two applications, or might work at big companies and aren't used to that kind of thing, I would just say, just trust us. It's going to accelerate everything. It's going to give you more feedback. It's going to get you more engagement from potential team members or other developers that can use the code you're building. And if you drop your project, there's a chance somebody else picks it up later just by finding their way to something that they care about.
00:38:01.920 - 00:38:52.520, Speaker C: And you might end up finding a teammate or a project that you can advise or invest in or be part of even after the fact. So I would say definitely go fully open source and build in the open from the beginning, and then name your project. Go on Fiverr, get a logo for it, make a Twitter account and start building the audience for it. Announce what it is that you're trying to build. Make a landing page. Stuff in crypto can be pretty complicated, but it's also the world's attention is on this industry right now. So it's very easy to start collecting what will ultimately be your first user base and start getting attention and mentorship from the existing community.
00:38:52.520 - 00:39:43.612, Speaker C: That has a lot of pattern recognition and wisdom, but you're not going to get that as easily if you don't put yourself out there and say, okay, here's the project, this is what it's called. This is the two lines about what it is, and here's where to reach us. On Twitter so I'd say this is the ethos of crypto, especially. I think this is especially important for people that haven't been in crypto for the last four or five years that are just coming in, lean over your skis and just be more open from the beginning. And, you know, wear your heart on your sleeve and you're going to get punched in the face probably, but you'll find that that's the beautiful part. That's when you'll start really enjoying crypto, is when you, you know, you go through your first struggle in public and, you know, and you push through it and you build community through it, 100%.
00:39:43.668 - 00:39:50.444, Speaker B: That's been my experience, totally. How about you? Any final thoughts for the.
00:39:52.784 - 00:40:45.424, Speaker A: Yeah, I wouldn't. I would start community as early as possible. Like, as, you know, those first lines of code that we built for Solana, we were in our telegram group, and there was about, like, just us, the devs, and the first people that would kind of join, they're like, what? When? When is I? When is Aco? And our response was, we're working on the code right now. It's all about the tech. And that created that environment in those super early days, that this was an engineering focused team, engineering focused community, and that was really important. And it grew from that, from those early days where there was just 30 people following me and Greg and Stephen, commenting on our pull requests and stuff and seeing the progress. And that was really awesome.
00:40:45.424 - 00:40:54.684, Speaker A: A lot of those folks stuck around. Some of them became validators and really became the heart of the whole ecosystem.
00:40:56.624 - 00:41:25.994, Speaker B: Amazing. Well, I'm super excited to see what the community creates. I've already been super stoked in my short time building in Solana about what everyone's created. You know, if I'm interested in gaming projects, if anyone is out there working on some sort of gaming project, you can hit me up at Twitter. On Twitter justincon. I'm, you know, super supportive and we want to. The goal with fractal is to, like, empower people to build and release gaming projects to.
00:41:25.994 - 00:41:41.814, Speaker B: Incredible, you know, let me know. And if you're interested in art and, you know, burning man art also hit me up. It's incredible. Cool, thanks. Thanks, guys.
