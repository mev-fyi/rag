00:00:14.280 - 00:00:45.344, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Good afternoon. My name is Anand Gomes. I'm the co founder and CEO of Paradigm. We are a large institutional liquidity network focused on derivatives. And today I'm with a fabulous set of panelists here looking to talk about whether the huge options market in traditional finance, what was the likelihood of and when, rather will it move to move on chain. So, before we get started, we'd love to introduce.
00:00:45.344 - 00:00:49.124, Speaker A: Get the panelists to introduce themselves, maybe Orissa, if you want to go first.
00:00:49.464 - 00:01:14.114, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Hi, everyone. My name is Arisa, and I'm the co founder and CEO of C Sega. Sega is a Defi options protocol that built the first exotic options smart contracts in Defi. And we are currently issuing vaults that are investment strategies that users can stake in that generates really high APY. We're currently number one on Solana in terms of volume, and we're number two across all chains.
00:01:14.854 - 00:01:46.274, Speaker C: Hi, everyone, I'm Cindy. I'm the co founder of Drift Protocol. We're a derivatives exchange built on Solana, and we focus primarily on perpetual swaps, though I think options is definitely in the horizon. We launched our v one last year, this time at Breakpoint, did about $10 billion in volume, making us one of the fastest growing Solana Defi protocols. And we just dropped v two live at break point as well. So please check out our twitter and. Yeah, happy to talk more about it.
00:01:46.714 - 00:02:24.130, Speaker D: Hi all, I'm Tommy Johnson with Psi options. Forgive me for the notes, but I've been in the ecosystem for two years, so it's been a long journey and a lot has happened. Scioptions was the win winner of the first Solana serum Defi hackathon. The first to ever launch physically settled, american style options on chain in a decentralized manner. The first to have an acquisition in the Solana ecosystem, with the acquisition of Tap finance, which put us into the structured product space. Sai also had the most successful IeO in FTX history. As we all know, derivatives are a highly regulated space in the US.
00:02:24.130 - 00:02:52.084, Speaker D: So we've been investing heavily in decentralization and governance. We are a leader in Solana governance infrastructure and the first foundation to move all SAfs into locked invested token contracts on chain with governance voting. So with that psyoptions is the underlying options in structured product infrastructure on Solana. But as you can see, we've evolved past that to be a leader in the decentralized organization and governance.
00:02:52.624 - 00:03:06.272, Speaker E: Nice. Hey, everyone. Nice to meet you all. I'm Tristan. And I'm the founder of Zeta Markets. We're one of the premier venues for derivatives trading on Solana. So we do exchange traded futures options and now perps as of a few days ago.
00:03:06.272 - 00:03:11.604, Speaker E: And we also specialize as well in kind of OTC options trading and structured products.
00:03:12.044 - 00:03:23.304, Speaker F: Okay. Hello, everyone. I'm Renan. I'm the head of Latin America for Darabit. Darabit different from the others. I'm a centralized exchange. But we do believe in Defi as well.
00:03:23.304 - 00:03:35.972, Speaker F: So, yeah, we are one of the largest derivatives exchanges out there. The largest one. When it comes to options, we have over 90% of the market share. So, yeah, that's pretty much it.
00:03:36.148 - 00:04:09.328, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, the title of this talk was partially taken from a quartz article last year where they talked about single stock options getting to 450 billion a day and sort of like, beating just like, stocks. But before we sort of get into whether that market will move on chain, maybe it makes sense to quickly tell people here, what is the size of the option market today in crypto across c five and DeFi. Maybe you could start on the DeFi part and then take us on with c five.
00:04:09.456 - 00:04:49.774, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, since DeFi has started in 2020, I think what people have failed to recognize is that we're still so, so early. I think people often think about DeFi at the same size as the entire crypto market, but it's completely different. And Defi derivatives, especially today, is probably around $3 billion. And then c five derivatives is around $90 billion, and tradfi derivatives is at $16 trillion. And so what that means is there's so much potential for the market to grow. But not only that, when you look at the size of tradfi markets, the size of derivatives is actually majority of the market.
00:04:49.774 - 00:05:03.254, Speaker B: But in crypto derivatives, actually like less than 10% of the market. Which means even with the existing market size, there's so much opportunity for categorical expansion. And this is what all of us here are trying to do.
00:05:04.074 - 00:05:15.554, Speaker A: And maybe, Renan, give us a little bit of where does derribit stand in terms of. Because you are the largest player in the industry, some idea about volume and things like that.
00:05:15.634 - 00:05:40.710, Speaker F: Yeah. So today, our turnover daily is between two and $5 billion. We're quite large. But when we compare today, the traditional finance, and not even if we compare it to the perps and futures volume, we are still a tiny bit. So there is a lot of room to grow. Completely agree, not only on c five, but, of course, Defi as well.
00:05:40.862 - 00:06:24.356, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I think it's, you know, just 2 billion in volume a day, you know, for options, let's call it 250 tvl in the Defi space. So definitely a long ways to go. But do you think that a similar. What is the catalyst? Because in tradfi, the catalysts were sort of this gamified trading, zero commission, things like that. And of course, all these meme focused discussions on social media, crypto has a lot of that. But what is the catalyst, do you think, for crypto options to sort of take off not just across defi, but also just in defi? Because like you said, we're still very small.
00:06:24.356 - 00:06:32.944, Speaker A: Right. Do you think it has to be sort of a crypto native set of catalysts, or do you think it's, you know, or just like, you know, like you said, gamify trading, etcetera?
00:06:33.564 - 00:07:22.214, Speaker F: Yeah, well, the fact that our product is we, you probably know, we have inverse products rather than linear products, which is a little bit more complicated to understand. The linear one is you have the collateral and stablecoin or just regular options trading. If we look at Darabit and all the options platforms we are actually having, it's like you were trading Tesla options with Tesla shares. So that's a little bit more difficult for retail to understand. That's one of the pain points, I guess. And also, of course, regulation. It's a difficult time for you not to be regulated.
00:07:22.214 - 00:07:34.934, Speaker F: It's rather, in my opinion, it's a matter of time much more than a question of if it's going to happen. So, yeah, that's some of the pain points for us.
00:07:35.594 - 00:08:18.400, Speaker A: I would love, Tristan, your opinion on this, too, because you're basically building an exchange, but fully on chain. How much you talked about the complexity. Crypto perks are such an easy thing to get into and get leverage out of. And the exchanges have done a fantastic job of just making sure that experience is super easy and simple. But for options, like you said, it's much harder for people to understand a, it's priced and settled in bitcoin, that's obviously one hurdle. But also managing the Greeks, the delta vega gamma, things like that. How do you think about these things as you thought about building Zeta and your go to market?
00:08:18.552 - 00:08:49.413, Speaker E: Yeah, great question. So we definitely think UX is really paramount to the options experience. We talk to a lot of customers, and I think given that crypto and Defi especially is so retail driven, those people come to the platform and they kind of see all these Greeks and they very much scared away from that. It's a very different trading experience. Most people are used to this like long only short only behavior. This is really taking kind of bets on kind of probability of where the price will end up in certain kind of time ranges. So it's a lot more, I guess, different in terms of the trading experience.
00:08:49.413 - 00:09:27.728, Speaker E: We focus a lot on the UX, so not only making it easy to understand in terms of education, but also in terms of the trading interface, trying to break that down. And so something that I know you guys have also been doing really well is stuff like combos, I think are pretty killer for options. I don't expect everyone to come in there and just be like, I'm going to trade all these individual options and make up this iron Condor payoff. Like we want to do these one click strategies and really break it down for people. I think vaults have been doing that really well. I think there's still a bit of a transparency problem where people think they're getting kind of risk free yields. But I think these kind of UX innovations where people actually trade a lot of complex strategies in the backend but don't have this mental overload, I think will go a long way.
00:09:27.816 - 00:09:45.620, Speaker D: I think the UX is exactly why we shut down our order book based trading. That's what we originally launched as and then went more into the structured product was because not enough flow or volume to make it profitable for market makers. So getting liquidity there is hard, and then the UX is just hard for retail and individuals to come in.
00:09:45.732 - 00:10:19.464, Speaker A: So, you know, I definitely share that, you know, because most of our customers are institutional, but we do get, you know, from time to time and they kind of struggle, especially if they're first timers. But I do think UX is still part of the issue. You know, Cindy, I would love your opinion on, you know, has perps sucked out all the air out of the room? You know, because it's such an easy instrument to do, to sort of ape into, you know, is that you think that contributes towards and would love everyone else's opinion on this, too. What do you think?
00:10:19.924 - 00:10:30.620, Speaker C: Yeah, I think perps has definitely been the catalyst for a lot of retail coming into not just defi, but going beyond spot trading.
00:10:30.652 - 00:10:31.012, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:31.108 - 00:11:21.710, Speaker C: It's a very simple one click product. You think Solana is going to go up at break point, you click a ten x long button and you immediately go long versus figuring out all these complexities with options in terms of whether it's, I think, sucking liquidity out, I don't think that's necessarily the case. I think perps serves multiple different functions, even within the options world, to help users hedge their options positions, build different types of combinations together. For instance, like no loss derivatives, where you can long a perp using proceeds from selling, selling options and hedge it as well. And so I think perps definitely is the gold standard in terms of Ux and a lot of options. Innovations like perpetual options is sort of catching up to how simple perpetual swaps have been.
00:11:21.902 - 00:12:11.830, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to add on to that point, I think perpetual futures and options have very different user insights when trading them. And so I think perpetual futures is great, but it's a very directional product, whereas in options you can actually create delta neutral positions that take your position on volatility instead of a directional bet. And so there's so many ways you can actually combine the two products, like Cindy said, to express your view on the market. But the value of options is not only just like the volatility and the direction, but by adding exotic options. For instance, you can add conditions on top of the contract that allows for more flexibility of how you want to structure your view in the marketplace. So you can structure in a way where it's like, you know, higher risk and super high rewards, or you can also structure in a way where you can be more risk adjusted and you can create something that is safer with a good yield.
00:12:11.830 - 00:12:17.114, Speaker B: And so those are the ways you can really leverage both the perpetual products and the options products together.
00:12:17.494 - 00:12:45.524, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. You know, I think I'd go on to say that, to me, it's really a function of market evolution. You know, in the beginning of any market, your views are quite simple in that sense, because the market's getting off the ground. Speculation tends to be the only first catalyst, and that tends to be directional. But then as the market develops, people tend to have more complex views. Maybe I want to be long volume or I don't care about which way price goes.
00:12:45.684 - 00:12:47.100, Speaker B: Like, yeah, exactly.
00:12:47.132 - 00:13:20.252, Speaker A: Or I need to be, I want to have a tailored risk or investment profile. So I'm definitely in the camp that as the market continues, and we've definitely seen this in our own business as well. Well, because complex views institutions tend to be the ones that have complex views, and the options markets and the flows we see continue to increase even in the bear market. And I think that's validating what we're all talking about, that people want custom views. Options are the best way to express those. So, Tommy, any thoughts on that?
00:13:20.348 - 00:14:08.804, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's why I like to answer the question for what this talk is about. I think the answer for me is not yet. You know, the order book based trading we're doing under collateralized european style, like we were developing that for months. But you know, you have to cross the spread as a trader if you're trying to put on more than one option just to buy the two legs, because based how order books are right now on chain, it's you're buying one leg at a time if you're trying to be able to create complex structures with individual puzzle pieces. And that's why I think it's going to take structured products getting more flow in driving those. We just launched a partnership with Zeta markets that's pushing flow onto their order books. So we're a strong believer that structured products are now and then the volume and flow through order books and more complex structures will come.
00:14:08.804 - 00:14:25.944, Speaker D: And I think RFQs and we get things like that on chain will ease the burden into eventually having enough volume going through that order books are justified where you don't have to pay an arm and a leg to a market maker just to have liquidity on the books.
00:14:26.644 - 00:14:50.576, Speaker A: It's a great segue to my sort of next question. Talked about structured products. Do you think so? We talked about two things in this. First, I guess few minutes. One was the theme to me was like, hey, ux needs to be easier. People need to be able to go in and out of things, and that experience needs to be easy and not too burdensome cognitively. And then you talked about custom views.
00:14:50.576 - 00:15:14.284, Speaker A: Now, vaults represent both of those things, right? Do you think dovs obviously ribbon sort of pioneered those friction, came after Sega, obviously is number one. Solana. And do you think dovs and structured product vaults are the killer app? Are you guys feeling that now is the time where we're really moving to that next stage?
00:15:15.474 - 00:15:37.130, Speaker D: I would say yes, for now. Like this is. That's definitely the short and medium term. I mean, it abstracts the complexities away of selecting strikes. I think that's why perps are very easy and they're now as well is, you know, you don't have to select a strike and expiration. You just take a directional position and then manage funding rate, you know, and manage that position. So it's the killer app for now, in my opinion.
00:15:37.322 - 00:16:08.608, Speaker E: Yeah, I have a bit of a contrarian opinion, I guess, to that. I think they're pretty good and they've sold this kind of, kind of problem of actively having to manage and kind of understand how options work. It's almost like a yield farm, right? You put your money in there, set and forget. And this thing, maybe you get exercise and then people get pretty unhappy. But I think options are like a pretty active product. And I think the exchange traded ones, like the really big thing hampering it has been liquidity, right? With the perp, you've essentially got one product to trade with options. You've maybe got like eleven strikes, both calls, puts and then multiple expiries.
00:16:08.608 - 00:16:35.624, Speaker E: You're suddenly having to market make like 50 to 100 products, like the same market. That's really hard. And if we can kind of solve that and concentrate that, I think that will happen. We've been working really hard on that and we've actually seen our dex volumes, like order book traded stuff picking up. It's literally like doubled in the last two days. Now doing kind of more 20 to 25 mil daily, which we think is pretty cool. And there's definitely a market there and we're seeing more people coming in there and like actively, I think, taking on these strategies and kind of trading on order books.
00:16:35.624 - 00:16:41.512, Speaker E: But I think in the meantime. Yeah, like these vaults are pretty great for the people that just want to earn passive yield by selling options.
00:16:41.688 - 00:17:32.704, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And I think dovs are definitely a great business model in terms of driving a lot of adoption. I think the financial engineering in the DeFi options space is still pretty nascent. And, you know, my personal view is that retail users should not be trading vanilla options. They are extremely risky products where when the market moves 5%, you're actually losing money. I think for retail users, it's actually exotic options that are risk adjusted, that creates safer yields in volatile market environments. And I think in terms of what we see in traditional markets, like over 80% of wealth management products are actually risk adjusted, exotic structured products, whereas vanilla options are more used for active trading by hedge funds and institutions, which I think would be kind of how the crypto derivative market will also grow into.
00:17:33.344 - 00:17:57.288, Speaker A: I think, from our perspective. So we've started to host a lot of the dov auctions now. You talked about liquidity. One thing paradigm does well is we bring liquidity to people like ribbon friction, etcetera. But a market's two sided. You need takers and you need makers. I've always believed the liquidity providers will go where the flow is.
00:17:57.288 - 00:18:21.286, Speaker A: You don't really need to convince them once they see the flow. But where is the taker flow coming from in your mind? Because we need to create some sort of native crypto takers or use cases that is not just scammy in terms of driven by the token rewards or whatever, there needs to be some use case. Where do you guys see this TVL coming from?
00:18:21.470 - 00:19:14.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for Sega specifically, it's all about structuring. So it's about figuring out the strategy that is like something that both parties want. And so in our inaugural product, which is an exotic derivative vault called a fixed coupon note, as a user, it is a yield generating product, and there's a fairly low probability that the trade knocks in which like, touches a barrier that exposes you to the downside. And on the other side, market makers are happy to put on this position because it is actually a much cheaper, cheaper hedge for their downside. So they're basically paying for insurance on their book. That generally tends to go long. And so I think figuring out a structure that works on both sides can really help with avoiding, like needing to put like an inflationary, like, token reward or like, you know, trying to structure deals that kind of reduces the velocity of market innovation.
00:19:15.354 - 00:19:37.112, Speaker E: Yeah, I had an opinion on that as well. Like, I think right now you don't see as many people just going out there and just taking, I guess, vanilla options. But I think when you actually start to leverage defi composability, that's when you'll get these kind of natural takers. And I think there are so many options for that. Right? No pun intended. But, for example, imagine a lot of amms. They're exposed to impermanent loss.
00:19:37.112 - 00:19:52.502, Speaker E: Options are great for hedging. What if you could hedge that out? You can kind of create this imperfect hedge using options. Maybe you integrate that with some of the big vaults on Solana, and essentially they use you in the backend as this kind of service for hedging that out. We think that'd be pretty massive, but.
00:19:52.598 - 00:20:18.754, Speaker A: Let'S take that a little bit deeper. But the use case, I think we're all on board, but who do you think? Like this tv out, for instance, do you have any insight on who's depositing money in these vaults? Are they whales high net worth? Some idea? Because obviously I don't have an insight into this, but was curious, at least. I know Tommy, you guys run a vault. Sega, you guys run a vault. Any insight into who's actually depositing money?
00:20:18.914 - 00:20:54.654, Speaker B: Sure, I can help answer that. So Sega is currently number one in terms of volume on Solana and number two across all chains. So we have a lot of depositors, and we can say that they're both institutional and retail depositors. And we feel like in vanilla vaults, it's actually a lot of retail depositors only. The reason is we put exotic derivatives on chain. And exotic derivatives basically have a very complex operation in terms of observations and settlements in traditional institutions. There's an entire middle office, back office that is handling this operation that is a lot more costly and tedious than vanilla options.
00:20:54.654 - 00:21:40.372, Speaker B: By putting it all on smart contract, it is actually automated and it is actually a lot cheaper to run these strategies. And so we see a lot of institutional interest in running this exotic option strategy through our systems and our smart contracts. We also see that these types of products, especially the fixed coupon notes that we roll out, they are very popular wealth management products in the real world or in traditional finance. And in traditional finance. The issue is, because it is such a costly operation to run these products, they're often only available to private banking clients. And they come with kind of a minimum ticket size of around one hundred k us dollars. But by putting it on smart contracts, we make it available for any users to invest from just like 0.01
00:21:40.372 - 00:21:53.212, Speaker B: USDC. And not only do we see kind of an institutional interest for making operations easier, we see a lot of retail interest because we make the products more accessible to everyone through digitalizing the relationship.
00:21:53.388 - 00:22:39.808, Speaker D: I still think we can say there's a lot of depositors, but I think 95% of the TVL, if not more, is coming from institution and investor backers of these projects. You know, we can see a lot of the volume or a lot of the TVL moving out in size after like recent hacks or things, and, you know, changing macro conditions. And so I think that's why I think over the next few weeks, months, you're gonna see probably months, you're gonna see a lot of drastic change of TVL moving. You know, we talk about who's in first right now, but I think that's gonna change many times over the next few months because the real size comes from primary whales institutions who are taking directional risk, hedging it elsewhere or setting and forgetting it when there's a less risky product.
00:22:39.976 - 00:22:53.280, Speaker E: Yeah, and if these big vaults and project treasuries and stuff start also using structured kind of financial products in the backend, these guys have massive treasuries of tens, if not hundreds, billions of dollars that they could potentially be monetizing there as well.
00:22:53.392 - 00:23:04.164, Speaker D: Exactly. So I think the majority of the volume of the TVL. Sorry, I don't think. I know it's coming from institutions in whales and primarily crypto native right now.
00:23:04.624 - 00:23:28.134, Speaker A: That makes sense to me. I mean, I guess going back to what we talked about earlier tends to be institutions that understand these things. So the people that are willing to deploy ten, $15 million capital should be them. I'm curious, how does Derbet, as a centralized player, how do you guys see the growth of these markets? Is it something you can align with? Are you guys thinking about some sort of DeFi offering?
00:23:28.294 - 00:23:28.766, Speaker F: Yeah, yeah.
00:23:28.790 - 00:23:28.926, Speaker A: No.
00:23:28.950 - 00:24:27.404, Speaker F: So, definitely. Well, we see that DeFi poses enormous possibilities, but also some key concerns, a few ones. So to date, we haven't seen any of the DeFi options, vaults being able to portfolio margining, which is a pain, especially when we're talking about institutional invest, institutional traders. Also, the fact that most of them still rely on there a bit to mark price is also a pain point. And the last one, which is, I think maybe the largest, the biggest issue is the regulation. So we've seen what happened with SBF's proposal, regulation proposal, regulatory proposal. It's still kind of unknown where the DeFi is going to go after regulation.
00:24:27.404 - 00:24:58.084, Speaker F: But apart from that, we actually have a stake in a DeFi options vault called thetanets. So we really like it. Yeah, we still believe that there's a lot of room to grow. As I said, we are the largest options exchange and still our open interest is at this month. So it's still a lot of room to go.
00:24:58.204 - 00:25:18.122, Speaker D: I think that's why decentralization and focus on decentralized governance is extremely important and why maybe it's a short term detriment to focus on that. It's definitely going to set, that's my thesis set up for the long term. We don't have just an entity in the US contributing. We have entities all over that are not, you know, they're only unified through decentralized governance.
00:25:18.298 - 00:26:05.476, Speaker A: So, you know, that's great. I agree with that. We've talked, obviously, we know there's a lot of potential here for these markets to grow. Renan, you talked about headwinds, right? So let's spend. What do you think are the headwinds? What are you guys seeing in each of the projects that you're working on? What are the one or two things? I'll go, because I think we deal with mainly in this jewish, and I'm sort of echoing some of the things that reno and do because we do a lot of business together. But I think the performance is one, putting things on chain, especially something like an order book, that requires, even with Solana, obviously being a leader, you're still subject to a 400 millisecond block time. But if you go to a high frequency trader.
00:26:05.476 - 00:26:25.454, Speaker A: They're usually used to 510 milliseconds, so performance is an obvious one. What else do you guys see? Or headwinds, portfolio margin? You talked about that. I think that's a great point as well. I don't think anybody's really cracked the code there yet. But are these the only things, or are you guys seeing other headwinds as well?
00:26:26.674 - 00:27:22.678, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one of the biggest things that's going to bring retails on chain versus on centralized exchange, and what DeFi uniquely enables is having long tail assets permissionless on chain. So we've really built our exchange to be able to support these type of long tail assets. Anything from the enews of the world or random betting coins that are able to drive retail interest and volume into DeFi that centralized exchanges cannot. We think that's one huge tailwind that's going to bring a lot of retails into the DeFi trading space, especially for leverage products. And secondly, I think having super deep liquidity on chain, which we're seeing more of, I think this year, as it's starting to get captured by market makers, trading on DeFi is really going to push more retail traders towards DeFi. Versus signing up using your email on an exchange.
00:27:22.846 - 00:27:58.044, Speaker E: Yeah, I think there are a few kind of major headwinds you mentioned a really good one. In terms of performance. We can't match the kind of millisecond acknowledgement times that a lot of these centralized exchange and have gone through all the problems with market making on chain and how difficult that is, especially where you have to pay all these gas fees for quoting. We're really excited for fydans to come out and hopefully scale Solana to a million transactions per second. I think that's super exciting. Otherwise, on the retail side, I think just in general, most of retail is fairly unsophisticated, and I think we know that. So more education and more pushing towards options education and getting people across that is really important.
00:27:58.044 - 00:28:12.284, Speaker E: And then probably on the institutional side, I think, yeah, hacks have definitely held the space back a little bit. I think it's also some of the infrastructure is not quite there in terms of on chain custody, KYC, other things that kind of scare off the compliance teams of these big firms.
00:28:13.184 - 00:28:17.084, Speaker D: Yeah, I think institutional custody is a big one that's been focused on recently.
00:28:17.784 - 00:28:39.544, Speaker B: Yeah. And another one, I think is financial engineering. I think there was a lot of builders in the space, but not a lot of people who have the experience and have the mathematical understanding of certain types of products. I think with like a lot more people with these experiences coming into the industry now. I think a lot of the products will actually have a higher level of financial engineering and better benefits as a result.
00:28:39.884 - 00:29:24.654, Speaker A: Awesome. I think we're out of time, but I think to summarize, you guys could add to this. I think one tremendous potential market is still a fraction of what it can be. Tons of challenges in terms of ux, some on chain hurdles, things like that, but also sense of hope. And not just hope, but also real traction in terms of you're actually seeing things like dovs and structured products evolve on chain with meaningful TVL. So again, I'm obviously very long this space, so very excited and I think 23, 24 to 2023 and 2024 you will really see an explosion of TVL and just the growth of options market in general, even on c five.
00:29:26.394 - 00:29:26.898, Speaker E: Agreed.
00:29:26.946 - 00:29:27.346, Speaker F: Cool.
00:29:27.450 - 00:29:29.314, Speaker E: Thank you. Thanks.
