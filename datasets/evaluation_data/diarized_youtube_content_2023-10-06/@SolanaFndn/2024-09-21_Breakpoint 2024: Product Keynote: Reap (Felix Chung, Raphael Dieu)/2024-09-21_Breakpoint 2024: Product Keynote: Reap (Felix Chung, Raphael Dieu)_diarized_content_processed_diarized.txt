00:00:09.200 - 00:00:09.876, Speaker A: Hi guys.
00:00:10.345 - 00:00:26.291, Speaker B: Hey guys. Hey folks. I'm Felix. I lead the biz ops team at reap. I look after all strategic partnerships around financial partners, international expansion and our general corporate development functions across the organization.
00:00:26.443 - 00:00:36.855, Speaker A: Hey guys. I'm a product lead arip and we work on building better financial tools for web3 projects to operate and to grow.
00:00:38.515 - 00:01:27.805, Speaker B: So what is Reap? So Reap is a technology provider that provides connecting the on chain and off chain networks of financial payments into one platform. We enable this by meshing both stablecoin issuers on chain and also the banking partners we have. This enables us to optimize financial flow on and off, both on chain and off chain. So the current offerings we have are what we call the REAP card, which is a Visa card that is stablecoin enabled so you can repay the bills using your stablecoins. We have Reap Pay, which is essentially a B2B payments product that allows you to use stablecoin as a way to pay a merchant to Fiat. So if I wanted to pay my lawyers, I could use stablecoins to fund it directly. And all in all, we have a reporting function that enables to aggregate all that data to give better reporting to your financial teams.
00:01:27.805 - 00:02:15.695, Speaker B: So obviously in the last six years we've been working very, very hard in combining both our banking partners and also the on chain financial partners to actually mesh both things to allow USDT and USDC to move on and off and able to make payments move around the world very easily. So right now what we can do is collateralize stablecoins and make vendor payments, immersion payments using the Visa card and obviously making also local payments, making payments to merchants and vendors that only take Fiat and cash by making connecting all those partners directly into those rails. So obviously from year to date in the last 12 months we've done over 2 billion just through using stablecoins and fiat on and off as well as we've experienced over 5x in growth in the last year.
00:02:17.515 - 00:02:41.975, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm gonna show you quickly exactly how it works. So this is my REAP account. I've just onboarded my projects on it. I have a virtual card, but I can also have physical card like this one. I saw some of you guys already have one. I can go ahead get my Solana wallet address right here and I can deposit Stable coins on it. So USDC and USDT on Solana.
00:02:41.975 - 00:03:24.655, Speaker A: So here I just want to use my USDC to operate and some of the Fiat word. So for example transactions being just processed on chain, I can go back to the tool I can go around and in a couple minutes my account will be funded. So we give you the fiat equivalent to collateralize your card. I have $15 just here and I can use it right away. So as soon as the money is credited I get my credit line. I can go ahead. I'm just going to go ahead and buy a calendly subscription for my team for example, right here and boom, using the card detail that I just got, I just have the transaction process by reap.
00:03:24.655 - 00:04:04.731, Speaker A: So super easy instant and I can use it right away because it's a Visa credit card you can use everywhere in the world. Now I can also make payments so I can for example pay a contractor. I have an invoice I need to pay for my contractor. I have stablecoins that I want to use on my treasury and they want to receive fiat for example. So here I can either find my payments using RIP Card or maybe directly using stablecoins. So for the demo I just top up like 50 USDC directly on my wallet here I'm going to send just 200 Kong dollar. We support all the major currencies.
00:04:04.731 - 00:04:28.949, Speaker A: Upload the invoice, I have a breakdown of the payment. I can just use the usdc. We directly convert into fiat and then REAP is processing the payment using the just the traditional banking rails. Right. So coming back to my dashboard, payment is completed. The RIP team has processed the payment and send the funds. And I can even show you on HSBC account funds have been received.
00:04:28.949 - 00:04:50.505, Speaker A: Right. So key takeaways we use, we empower you to use your stablecoins to operate in the FIAT world. You can collateralize your card, you can repay your bills, you can send funds very easily. We are very excited to finally be integrated with Solana to help your community and your projects to grow and to operate.
00:04:52.135 - 00:05:01.015, Speaker B: So we're after this. Me and Raf will be around. So if you guys are interested in learning more, feel free to scan on telegram QR codes and also meet us afterwards.
