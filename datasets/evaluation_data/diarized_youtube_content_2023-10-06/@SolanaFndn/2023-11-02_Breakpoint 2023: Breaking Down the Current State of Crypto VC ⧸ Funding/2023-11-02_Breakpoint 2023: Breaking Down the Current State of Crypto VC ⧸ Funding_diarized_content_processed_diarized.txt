00:00:03.760 - 00:00:21.014, Speaker A: I'm Ben Sprango. I am the head of strategic BD at the Solana foundation, joined here by some venture panelists. I'd love to kick it off quickly, introduce yourselves, introduce your fund, and maybe tell us a little bit more about check sizes and what you guys have been allocating to.
00:00:21.134 - 00:00:50.774, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah. Hello, everyone. My name is Brandon, and I'm with framework Ventures. We pride ourselves on being one of the earliest and largest funds in Defi, and I'm personally a principal there and have covered broadly what I would call the non EVM space. So, of course, excited to be here with the Solana community and crew, in addition to leading kind of more in the meat space, a lot of our emerging market coverage. So, yeah, jack of all trades, master of none.
00:00:50.774 - 00:00:51.634, Speaker B: That's me.
00:00:52.304 - 00:01:27.336, Speaker C: Hey, everyone. Austin Barack here. I'm a partner at Coin fund. Coin fund was one of the first funds investing exclusively in crypto. We've been around since 2015, have about 105 portfolio companies investing out of three main vehicles. So we have a series a fund where we invest about six to 10 million per investment, and then follow on for, you know, additional. Beyond that, we have a seed fund, $160 million fund, where we typically invest one to $3 million checks, as well as a liquid hedge fund.
00:01:27.336 - 00:02:07.364, Speaker C: So we're investing across the full stack, all the way from pre seed through token liquidity. Look to be very active value add investors, and I know that's something that every investor says, but we definitely look to do it. And I've co invested with framework a bunch, so they definitely fall in that camp as well. We have a bunch of dedicated resources on hr, marketing, platform growth, and otherwise. Personally, I've been at Coin fund for about three years. Before that, I was a Defi founder, worked at a crypto ETP issuer, and then was in the pavements industry.
00:02:07.944 - 00:02:37.900, Speaker B: Awesome. And just to round out, I didn't answer the question in terms of how framework participates, we look to predominantly lead seed and series A rounds. Check size totally fluctuates, but we're broadly focusing on defi, on gaming as our sort of consumer expression, and then a lot of the meat and potatoes, the middleware, the infrastructure to enable two of those verticals. So I like to clarify, because infrastructure is kind of too broad of a term nowadays.
00:02:38.092 - 00:03:09.534, Speaker A: Sure. Thanks, guys. So for the next topic, I would love to go into a little bit about what you guys have been investing in recently and, like, what kind of trends you guys are seeing. So I know a lot has changed over the last 24 months. We went from crazy bull market into very steep bear market. And a specific event of last year really changed the whole dynamic. So how has the last twelve months changed your investing priorities and what are you guys looking for right now?
00:03:10.374 - 00:03:11.510, Speaker B: Do you want to go ahead, Austin? Austin?
00:03:11.542 - 00:04:08.896, Speaker C: Yeah, happy to take that. I don't think it's changed our priorities really at all. I think it's actually made our job a lot easier as investors because a lot of the folks that were in crypto to make a quick buck weren't in it for the right reasons and weren't mission driven to build something substantial over the long term left the industry. And you know, I'll probably be back in the next two years and my job will be harder again. But I think the current crop of founders is really strong and focused on what they're building. We've definitely leaned a little bit more, I guess, into investing in things that are true primitive shifts. So we felt like over the last couple of years there were a lot of incremental improvements, but a lot of that base layer of application development, for example, in DeFi or a lot of, you know, existing frameworks for scaling solutions have hit market.
00:04:08.896 - 00:04:56.034, Speaker C: And now we're really looking to invest in things that are going to allow crypto to take that next forward. Whether next step forward, whether it's on kind of wallet user experience, whether it's on novel DeFi primitives like yield bearing stable coins backed by liquid staked assets, or bringing real world assets on chains, some interesting like ZK primitives or intersection of AI and crypto so that you can make AI kind of provably fair in a lot of computations there. So I think our philosophy hasn't changed, but we're definitely looking for teams that are gonna create that innovation that brought about the last cycle, which was Defi and nfts and what's that next step forward?
00:04:56.414 - 00:06:20.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I would match a lot of the sentiment there, but I'd say the broader part of what we've been doing the last twelve months has frankly been supporting and doubling down on a lot of the investments that we've already made. And frankly looking at those opportunities, not all of which work of course, that's the game, but then just getting that data back and sort of reinforcing our knowledge and our theses, questioning them at all times to say what sort of is sustainable, what makes sense, what has longevity versus to Austin's point, what's something that is kind of a bull market phenomena in and attracts maybe folks who come in for various reasons and there's all sorts of pros and cons there, but I kind of alluded to it already. We remain extremely bullish on DeFi, and not just defi today, but all of the different sort of flavors and resources and all of the different opportunities there are to scale DeFi. Maybe it's pushing into more of the tradfi markets, maybe there's a bit of a permission flavor there, if you will. And all of the resourcing that goes into making that palatable to regulatory, legal, all of the sorts of unsexy things that the industry doesn't like to talk about a whole bunch. And then with gaming, we frankly are just having more frank conversations with folks who raise capital. And it's like, cool, I want to play your game.
00:06:20.186 - 00:07:17.860, Speaker B: This is no longer an environment where you can just raise on a pitch deck and a dream. I need to be able to play something. I want to be able to touch and feel and just get a sense of what is the game going to be. And it doesn't need to be a fully 100% polished mobile ready. For example, game ship me a local file. Happy to download it, happy to squint my eyes and get a sense of where things are going. But yeah, I think the other area, and I'm sure we'll get into it too, is just frankly, boots on the ground, traveling the world and just saying what are some of the not fringe cases, but what are some of the new user behaviors? How are they interacting with all of the things that we here are putting on chain and, or looking to service, getting more activity and users on chain? How are people actually engaging with that? And of course, we've had to take a step back as an industry as a result of all sorts of funny business, if you will.
00:07:17.860 - 00:07:33.242, Speaker B: But we're rounding the corner on that. And so narrative moves quickly, the news cycle moves quickly. I'm not here to say we're back and it's up only and none of that, but I'd say we've broadly, as an industry, kind of dodged that bullet and we're rounding the corner.
00:07:33.418 - 00:07:58.954, Speaker A: Awesome. So we touched a little bit on products, things that you guys are interested in. I think that something that a lot of first time founders don't understand is how to approach VC and what specifically VC's are looking for in a founder or in a founding team. Can you talk a little bit about characteristics of the founding team when you do meet these folks, what you guys are looking for?
00:08:00.614 - 00:08:33.710, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah, I'll take this one. I mean, first and foremost, in terms of the founders the individuals, the team. You need to be of high integrity, and we certainly do run our reference checks 100%, make no mistake. And you need to just be someone who people generally respect. It's no longer a function of he's a gigabrain, it's a chad. There are all these sort of crypto Twitter memes you're not going to, maybe you'll get lucky, but framework, more likely than not, is not going to be sold on those value props.
00:08:33.710 - 00:09:43.818, Speaker B: It's more a function of what is sort of unique about yourself, your co founders, the founding team, and either your life experiences, your professional experiences, that lends you an unfair advantage to, frankly, just tackle the market that you seek to tackle. And I would add, more often than not, I think a lot of folks in crypto, at least early or first time founders, they focus explicitly on the technology and architecture and all the nooks and crannies. And make no mistake, that's very important. But you also need to be polished and up to speed and with a robust game plan on go to market, how do you persuade people to, a, take notice of what you're doing, b, just, frankly, care, and then c, you know, sort of close them on committing to working with you, whether that's as a partner or as a client or what have you. So, you know, we look for, I would say, generally well rounded individuals who can kind of run the gamut there. And maybe not all this is bundled into one individual. Across your founding team, you have these skills accounted for.
00:09:43.818 - 00:10:01.426, Speaker B: And then I would say, just in terms of what you're doing, differentiation. So it's no longer a game of kind of incrementalism. And, excuse me, there's a fly here. Get this guy out of here. Yeah. It's no longer a game of incremental improvements. Those are important.
00:10:01.426 - 00:10:31.388, Speaker B: But what's a step function change, or what's something that no one's doing? How can you give yourself an unfair advantage in that realm as well? And how well do you understand that? Like, for me, I love when someone starts schooling me or educating me on something that I'm not up to speed on. That's a key indicator for me, that. Okay, cool. I haven't heard this one before. Let's take note of that. Let's go and dive in and kind of come to our original understanding of such and then revisit. But I'd say high level.
00:10:31.388 - 00:10:34.304, Speaker B: Those are the things that I'm indexing to the most.
00:10:35.124 - 00:11:59.100, Speaker C: Yeah, I think on our end, it's obviously a large amount of overlap I think one of the things that's pretty critical when we're looking at teams is that they're in it for the long haul and they're not going to quickly give up on the idea if things aren't working. There's an incredible amount of tenacity that's required to be a founder. And especially in crypto, there are these bull cycles, but there's also bear cycles. And to see that you're willing to kind of work through those periods, one thing that you alluded to as well is you have to be the subject matter expert in what you're building, and that very quickly comes across. And our expectation is that you know way more about what you're building than you know what we know. But we're going to do a ton of work market mapping the entire sector, speaking to every other company, speaking to customers, and it comes across pretty quickly whether you're really the expert in your field or not on team composition, knowing where you have gaps and knowing where you need to hire and being able to sell the vision of what you're building is probably one of the most critical pieces that often founders miss. And it's something that I don't think it's something you're innately born with.
00:11:59.100 - 00:13:10.804, Speaker C: It's something you can practice and get a lot better at, and people become very skilled at that. But it has such a wide ranging level of importance because, one, if you can't sell the vision, you're not going to be able to hire the best people, especially in the early stage when you're not going to be offering enormous cash salaries, and it's going to be largely driven on equity and token allocations. You're not going to be able to sell customers on the product and be able to successfully go to market. And then also, and this kind of makes sense when you think about it, but founders don't often think about is how well you're going to be able to raise capital in subsequent rounds, because that's one of the key risks for an early investor. Will they be able to raise their series a, their series b, a seed extension? And of course, we double down and actively kind of follow on. But being able to be really good at raising capital and having that skill de risks the success of a business a ton because you're able to fight through these tougher periods and have people tether to the story of what you're putting together. So I think those are some of the key characteristics.
00:13:10.804 - 00:13:31.224, Speaker C: But ultimately, and especially at the early stage, it comes down to the founder, every successful startup on average, pivots roughly once. So we're looking to invest in people. And yeah, that's, I think, probably paramount to everything.
00:13:32.444 - 00:14:02.494, Speaker A: So with the last few minutes that we have here, I want to touch on the post fundraising period, as you mentioned before, like investment from a VC. This becomes a partnership, this becomes like a long term friendship, typically 510 15 years that you guys are working together to bring this to fruition. So with that in mind, can you talk a little bit about how you work with portfolio companies, those kinds of services, and just from your experiences, what that's like and what the audience can expect?
00:14:02.834 - 00:14:39.868, Speaker B: Sure. I mean, to your point, it's a long term partnership, so you want to think about who it is that you're, so to speak, getting into bed with for this long term partnership. It's not so casual as I'll just take the highest valuation or the biggest check. Maybe that's okay, maybe that's what you're indexing towards. But I encourage everyone to think about the quality of the capital as well. And, you know, speaking towards sort of our mentality to portfolio support. I don't frankly have like this formulaic kind of response, or we have x number of people, you know, doing every single function and we have it all figured out.
00:14:39.868 - 00:15:45.822, Speaker B: Our mentality, though, is pretty simple. What's the main friction point? What's your bottleneck? What's holding you back? We don't want to get on catch up calls and hear all the positive. Cool, everything's working well. I frankly get on and I'm like, what sucks? What's keeping you up at night? Who's sort of in your way or what's in your way, what's the problem? And more often than not, I'd say early stage investments need help with two functions, predominantly hiring, recruiting 100%, and just getting access to high quality folks who have sort of the expertise or the knowledge or maybe the network to kind of, you know, set them apart in the industry. And the other is just frankly, product. Like, let's get to building on, not just like back end technologies, but start building the bridge to the front end and make it accessible, palatable, usable, and so, yeah, I mean, the other thing I would just mention is like, we're here, like, we're happy to meet with folks, like, we'll fly out, we'll do team offsites, we'll do whatever. At the drop of a hat, we'll show up.
00:15:45.822 - 00:16:11.364, Speaker B: Maybe it's founder therapy, maybe it's personal. Like there's all sorts of different things, but our impetus and our function is to keep you executing against the vision that you foresee and all of the sort of various hurdles and hoops and all the stuff you have to hop through. We want to help you take that on and just take as much off your plate as possible. So that's the kind of ground truth of it.
00:16:11.664 - 00:17:05.934, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I kind of echo that. Sentiment capital is increasingly commoditized, especially crypto is no longer a secret. It's an industry that people recognize has a lot of potential and there's a lot of investors actively investing. So if you want to differentiate, you have to provide value. And I think we definitely look to do that. We have a whole bunch of services, so we work with teams on hiring, we work with them just on like executive and professional coaching, helping them learn to many first time founders don't know how to run a hiring process, run a performance evaluation cycle, work through some internal troubles that often come up just running a business, thinking about how they should build a sales function and properly sell to a customer.
00:17:05.934 - 00:17:39.784, Speaker C: How you grow from a team that's three to a team that's eight, to a team that's 20, to a team that's 50. Because organizationally, the structure is very, very different for all of those sizes. Also have dedicated support on the marketing and branding side and a whole bunch of other areas. I like to work closely with portfolio companies. A jack of all trades. Think it kind of along the lines of like, what's your problem? Want to help with that? Let me demo the product. Let's go through the entire product flow.
00:17:39.784 - 00:18:37.852, Speaker C: And I use DeFi, I use nfts, I'm using all of these apps actively as a user. So let me share whatever insights I can share. But also thinking about one of our value adds is not even something that we're doing personally, but we have a really large portfolio. We've been investing for eight years, which means many of the companies we've invested in have become quite successful. So allowing younger founders, or kind of earlier stage founders within our network to benefit from the learnings of the folks that we've invested in that have become more successful and have this community where founders can work with each other and pick each other's brain and have this kind of forum that allows them to leverage those learnings. So that's definitely another key component for us. But yeah, at the end of the day, I think it's incumbent on an investor to provide value.
00:18:37.852 - 00:18:45.804, Speaker C: Otherwise there's a lot of money out there. So there's no reason to pick an investor that doesn't and do references.
00:18:45.884 - 00:19:24.766, Speaker B: Check, ask, ask other teams, always 100%. The one thing I would just add is another part of any VC's function, but something you need to index to is not necessarily finding someone who's going to tell you what to do, but someone who will 100% have a database and experience kind of an archive to query in terms of definitely what not to do. So that's a big part of how I approach providing value to port codes is like, I've seen it done this way, I've seen it done that way, you know, put sort of your spin on it and I can tell you, for a matter of fact, that, you know, x, Y and z won't work, whereas a, B and C may have a better shot. And so I think that's a big part of it, too.
00:19:24.870 - 00:19:30.034, Speaker A: Yeah. With the last few seconds, quickly give the audience where they can get in touch with you guys.
00:19:30.694 - 00:19:44.346, Speaker C: Yeah, so you can feel free to send me a DM on Twitter. They're open. It's Justinbarak, Austinbarack. And I check them often. And yeah, happy to chat everywhere.
00:19:44.490 - 00:19:54.122, Speaker B: Epodz 23, Twitter, telegram, you name it, LinkedIn, I'm on all of them. Pigeon mail, Google me, you can find me snail mail. Absolutely.
00:19:54.258 - 00:19:54.834, Speaker C: Sounds good.
00:19:54.874 - 00:19:58.614, Speaker A: Well, that's all the time we have. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. Let's give it up for the panelists.
00:20:01.354 - 00:20:01.794, Speaker B: Thank you.
