00:00:03.720 - 00:00:34.216, Speaker A: All right. I am so excited for this discussion. My name is Amir, and I'm the head of policy at the Solana foundation. And I spent the first part of my career actually working in DC in the Obama administration on a range of foreign policy issues. And so engaging with government is something I care deeply about. And I think there's a lot of misconceptions around how DC works, especially in the web3 community. With me to discuss this, we have Michael Cameron, who's a professional staff member right now at the US House of Representatives and the Energy and Commerce Committee.
00:00:34.216 - 00:01:01.438, Speaker A: And we'll talk about what that means. We have Landon Zinda, who's policy council at Coin center, which is a sort of premier think tank, thinking about crypto related issues in DC. Before this, he used to be an advisor to Senator Pat Toomey. And has anyone here heard of Congressman Tom Emmer? He was in the news last week. Okay, we got a couple. He used to work for Tom Emmer as well. And then at the very left, we have Arjun Ghosh, who is a tax attorney at Kaplan in Drysdale.
00:01:01.438 - 00:01:22.574, Speaker A: He has crypto tax for anyone who's looking for a good tax attorney. And he used to work for Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. You might have heard of the Gillibrand Lummis bill. Arjun's one of the key authors of that bill. So we got some real pros here to talk about how DC works. And so why don't we start going down the line and address the big question first. Is DC veep or house of cards? Michael?
00:01:22.914 - 00:01:23.762, Speaker B: I'm going to say it's a little.
00:01:23.778 - 00:01:50.914, Speaker C: Bit of both, depending the situation. I think Veep. I think when you're managing like a member, it tends to be a little bit more comedic. There is one scene, though, I think in House of cards where they go, he wants an education bill, and Suiki says, give me the four best people on education and lock them in a room until they have a product. I think that is a lot of how the really big 2000 page bills get made in a crisis.
00:01:51.214 - 00:02:16.993, Speaker D: Landon Veeper, House of cards so it's veep 100%. And I can tell one story about why it's kind of like Veep for Tom Emmer. Thankfully, most of this is public and meme. He caught on as a meme. I was working for Tom Emmer on the House financial services committee, and we were preparing for a hearing. It was during COVID so it was all remote. All the members were on a zoom.
00:02:16.993 - 00:02:44.724, Speaker D: Tom Emmer starts playing around with the backgrounds and puts, like, a beach coast behind him. And so it's a bunch of members all in their offices or at their homes, and then Tom, members at a beach. And it was funny to look at and felt like he was prepared. He had everything he needed. So I signed off. Once they got to him during the hearing, he appeared. He had rotated his camera twice, so he was upside down.
00:02:44.724 - 00:03:35.120, Speaker D: He had put a background behind him, and his shirt kind of was a green screen, so it looked like a detached head upside down. And he, for some reason, he thought he'd just go through that and just charge through and say his remarks. And at the best comedic timing, the chairwoman of the committee, Maxine Waters, said, tom, are you okay? And, like, everybody started laughing, and it was hilarious. And the only thing you could do at that point is make fun of yourself. So it was the same time during COVID when that one lawyer went to a remote case and he appeared as a cat, and he had to argue to the judge that he wasn't a cat. So we tweeted and Tom Emmer posted, I am not a cat. With this picture of him upside down.
00:03:35.272 - 00:03:39.964, Speaker A: Tom Emmer, not a cat. Yes, Arjun, is DC veep or house of cards?
00:03:42.984 - 00:04:32.005, Speaker B: I actually wasn't prepared for this question. I thought the question was, is DC Veep or the west Wing? I think we all want to think that it's the west Wing, but in real life, it's like Landon said, it's much more like Veep. It's definitely not House of cards, though. There is no city on the planet that is more sexless than DC. My Veep story is not a single story, but rather every time I've been with any member, you are preparing them on the way to the podium of where they're about to speak with last minute notes, or maybe even first minute notes. The first time you've talked to them, all those scenes in veep where you see the other characters whispering in her ear as she's about to go speak somewhere, that is 100% true. You're really preparing on the fly.
00:04:32.149 - 00:04:40.061, Speaker A: I used to do that all the time. I used to be the note hander and being like, hey, make sure you say this thing in the meeting. And then 50% of the time they ignore you anyway.
00:04:40.157 - 00:04:45.821, Speaker B: And sometimes it's grab the notes back, cross something out, change it, and then put it back immediately.
00:04:45.957 - 00:04:48.197, Speaker A: And then they ask for a coffee.
00:04:48.325 - 00:04:49.473, Speaker D: Totally for you.
00:04:49.814 - 00:05:09.274, Speaker A: So I want to do a little, like, civics 101. Just give us a reminder. Let's talk about the different branches of the US government. And when we say what is DC and who is operating, who are we actually talking about here? So who wants to tell us just the overview of the three different branches of government and what it actually looks like to engage?
00:05:10.094 - 00:05:29.316, Speaker B: Arjun sure. Happy to. The three branches. So there's the legislative branch, that's Congress. There's the judicial branch, that's the courts. And then there's the executive branch. We think about the executive branch as the president, but all of the agencies that are under the executive branch are also part of it.
00:05:29.316 - 00:06:15.214, Speaker B: So treasury, the IR's, the Department of labor, the Department of Agriculture are all also part of the executive branch. And I think so, yeah, this is a really good question because what people always forget is that all of those agencies are part of the executive branch and so much policy is done through those agencies. So, I mean, I'm not going to say you guys do this, but I feel like people oftentimes when they're trying to influence policy, they focus exclusively on the legislative branch. They go and they talk to members of Congress or they talk to senators, and then if something goes wrong, they go to court. Right. They bring a lawsuit and they try to have the courts come and stop it and they skip. What I would say is the biggest area where policy is made, which is in the legislative branch, executive branch, through agencies.
00:06:15.214 - 00:06:45.096, Speaker B: You probably saw earlier this year, the Treasury Department put out some proposed regulations on broker reporting requirements. And those rules are way more specific and will have a much bigger effect on the way you all do your work than any law that Congress passes. And I think remembering that these specific agencies have so much to do with policymaking will be important as we go forward and try to make sure that the rules that come out to regulate this industry are the ones that will help it grow and prosper.
00:06:45.240 - 00:06:55.048, Speaker A: So Congress passes the law, but then there's a lot to interpret because implementing laws is pretty tough. So the agencies end up writing a lot of specifics and telling us how things are done.
00:06:55.216 - 00:07:23.080, Speaker C: And I think to that point, I mean, just to the point on the agencies. So, for example, a good example is clean air regulations. So in the seventies, they were like, we have too much smog. We should have clean, like cleaner air. But they didn't exactly set, like exactly what CO2 level, exactly what, you know, PM 2.5 level should be considered, like clean. And so I think they kind of left a lot of those specifics to be implemented by the executive branch.
00:07:23.080 - 00:07:35.364, Speaker C: And I think that's where there's a lot of interpretation that goes into that, which can be both helpful in some cases, but also can be pretty harmful when you have a regulator that's trying to to harm the industry.
00:07:36.264 - 00:07:48.604, Speaker A: I want to dig in a little bit to Congress, because each of you is either a current or former staffer in Congress. What is the role of Congress and what does it actually look like to engage different members of Congress? Michael.
00:07:49.024 - 00:08:31.506, Speaker C: So I work on a committee, so I'm on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. We can be thought of as like the House technology Committee. Something that you guys are probably familiar with that we recently did was the TikTok CEO hearing. So I think for us, we really focus on the tech aspects of blockchain, especially when it comes to how the blockchain works, especially how it's impacting consumers. When I think of how to engage, and I think if there's one thing that you guys should take away, if you're not at the table, you're on the menu. This is a pretty common phrase in DC. And basically what that means is if you aren't telling your story, people aren't going to care.
00:08:31.506 - 00:09:04.938, Speaker C: And so when someone comes for you, if they don't know who you are, they don't know why they should care, they're not going to defend you. I think so much of just the way that all of you can engage is just to try and tell your stories to members of Congress. My boss has a saying that the shortest distance between two people is their story. And I think that it's just important for you guys to kind of be in charge of your own destiny by telling your story, by engaging people, because that will help you control your own narrative and ensure that you guys have defenders throughout DC and other governments.
00:09:05.026 - 00:09:18.174, Speaker A: So let's dig into that and what it looks like to do that effectively. Arjun, we were backstage and you were saying effective engagement is sort of like the movie inception. And I'm curious if you could talk about sort of how inception might have happened with your former boss.
00:09:19.254 - 00:09:59.934, Speaker B: So I watched inception on the flight over, and, you know, they talk about this idea that the strongest ideas are ones that people came up with themselves, or at least think that they came up with themselves, right? Like, if someone convinces you of something, sure, you might believe them, but you believe them, and that's why you believe in that idea. Whereas if you figure out something on your own, you probably think much more strongly about it. And I think that applies to the way political leaders make their decisions. Political leaders all have relatively outsized egos. That's why they became politicians. To begin with, they don't want to be behind the scenes. They want to be the people that have the ideas.
00:09:59.934 - 00:10:47.960, Speaker B: I think one of the best ways to engage well with leaders is by figuring out what they particularly care about and then tailor your story to them. Mike was just talking about how important it is to be able to tell your story. And while sure you want to be able to tell your story, your goal isn't to share your story. Right? Your goal is to convince this person that they should believe in your story. So you shouldn't think about it in a selfish way, like, oh, I want to think of my story and tell it in the way that represents me best. You should think, okay, what do these people really care about? And then how can I tailor my story to be something that they care about? So I think this is also something that you all are able to do really, really well because your technology is so broad and able to do so many things. You don't have to just go and talk about web3 broadly.
00:10:47.960 - 00:11:48.294, Speaker B: You can go to a urban Democrat and talk about how web3 applications can increase access to banking and financial products for people that traditionally have been left out of the financial sector. Or you can go to a rural Republican and talk about how web3 has capabilities of increasing rural broadband access for people that have had trouble getting big telecommunications character. Character. Big telecommunications organizations to build out broadband in their districts. You could talk to defense hawks about how you can track weapons with blockchains that are not editable. You can make sure that there's no fraud in where a missile goes after it's sold to another country. So I think just figuring out what the person that you're talking to wants to hear and then how to tell your story to them so that you're telling them what they want to hear is a way to have them later think that it's their own idea.
00:11:48.294 - 00:12:24.792, Speaker B: Actually, a good example. There's a really good Greg exithalis. I'll just say his name. He was teaching me about bloggers blockchain years ago and found out that my boss really cared about rural broadband in upstate New York. And he introduced us to the helium people who do exactly that. I learned about what they did. I talked about it with Senator Gillibrand, and a few weeks later, she came to me and she said, Arjun, wouldn't it be great if we could figure out a way to have these guys come up to upstate New York and help our constituents that don't have access to broadband? And at that point, it was her idea.
00:12:24.792 - 00:12:34.240, Speaker B: It clearly wasn't her idea, but by us pitching it in that way, it became her idea and she felt passionate about it. To really push it forward in the Senate.
00:12:34.432 - 00:13:43.292, Speaker C: One thing that I wanted to, I think, add and just pick up on what you said is that, like, members of Congress, they really just want to be liked. And I think they just want to be liked by their stakeholders, by their voters, whoever they can get in to behind them. One person that I first worked for basically was just like, hey, the first member I worked for said that, like, members of Congress, we just want to be liked by people. And I think just showing that there are people out there who are engaged on this issue who would care or would like them or not like them based on blockchain, I mean, I think just, I feel like a lot of people talk about the US government as if it's like a monolith, right? Like they say, like, oh, well, Gary Gensler's doing this, therefore, rural Indiana Republican, like, must agree with that. And I think, you know, there are 2 million people that are employed by the US government. And I think they all have totally different incentives, they have totally different things that they want totally different outcomes. And I think for members of Congress specifically, like, just understanding that they want to be liked and they want to have, like, people, like, respect them and, like, be seen as, like, thought leaders, I think is a great way to just, like, you don't have to be scared to go talk to members of Congress, I guess, because I think they are looking for people who.
00:13:43.292 - 00:13:48.180, Speaker C: But people that engage with them, they're looking to engage back and just to.
00:13:48.212 - 00:14:16.034, Speaker D: Try to demystify Congress a little bit more. Michael's with a committee, so he's a committee staffer, specializes on tech and blockchain issues. Arjun was in a personal office for Kirsten Jellebrand. I was in a personal office for Tom Emmer and then I worked for the Senate Banking committee. If you reach out to your members of Congress, you're most likely going to meet with a staffer from a personal office both in the House and. And the Senate. The House has roughly 15 staffers, far less staffed than a senator.
00:14:16.034 - 00:14:19.026, Speaker D: Senate staff personal office has like 40.
00:14:19.130 - 00:14:23.418, Speaker B: Maybe 40 in DC, another 20 back home. They're big.
00:14:23.506 - 00:14:25.850, Speaker D: And then committee staff. Your committee staff is the biggest, I'd.
00:14:25.882 - 00:14:28.762, Speaker C: Say, like, yeah, I think we have like 90, 95.
00:14:28.858 - 00:14:29.114, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:29.154 - 00:15:00.190, Speaker D: So you. So you'll meet with personal office, but they're also committee staff. And the personal office folks generally cover something much larger than just blockchain or crypto. Covering, like, energy and healthcare and a whole bunch of other stuff. So their time is limited, too. So when you meet with them and when you go to the Senate, those staffers are a little bit more specialized than the House personal staff. So important to kind of be concise and to the point about what you want changed when it comes to crypto, because they're focusing on a bunch of other stuff, too.
00:15:00.302 - 00:15:35.156, Speaker B: So let's talk. But just to add, each one of these levels are different offices. The people there have a different level of expertise in the thing that you're trying to teach them or the story that you're trying to tell them. And it's important to tailor what you're saying to the group that you're talking about, not just in content, but also in depth. So if you're talking to a person in a personal office, their first priority is the constituents in their district. So if it's a senator, it's an entire state. If it's a member of Congress, it's a particular geography, but figure out why the thing you're talking to them about will help the people in their community and talk about that community in a committee.
00:15:35.156 - 00:16:31.004, Speaker B: They're less focused on individual constituencies and more on a subject matter. So if you're talking to the Senate banking committee, talk about why this is good for banking regulations broadly. But you can also get much more into the weeds because the people there are banking lawyers or they're regulators. And we talked about agencies before. I think agencies are the place where they really are deep, deep experts in the subject matter and don't have a constituency other than the american people broadly. So that's where you want to bring your real wonky, either technical experts or policy people, because they're going to ask you questions about tech and about law and about regulation. They're not going to care about like, oh, is this going to help people with banking? They're going to care like, oh, does us CFR particular code section need to be changed to be modified to help affect this rule that we're trying to get into place?
00:16:31.424 - 00:17:12.140, Speaker A: I want to address a question that I hear a lot from founders in the space, just people in the space more broadly. Crypto is an industry of people who often are skeptical of government. I think there's growing skepticism of government, not just across the United States, but I think around the world. I think people are skeptical of institutions. There's a lot of fear, I think, of going and meeting with a staffer on the hill and making yourself known and explaining your story and so I want you to address this concern that by sticking your head out and requesting a meeting and going and telling the story of what your company, your project does, you're going to end up on some kind of hit list. Is there some kind of secret list in Congress of all the companies that have had meetings?
00:17:12.292 - 00:17:13.664, Speaker D: Don't tell her about the list.
00:17:14.324 - 00:17:39.837, Speaker C: I'll say no. Again, back to just like the size of the government, right? Like, what's going on at the SEC is just like very separate from, like, what any personal office will. You know, who they're meeting with and what's going on there. I will say, I mean, I think, you know, it's important on the engagement front. I mean, members typically take meetings. Like, if you sent, like, if you.
00:17:39.845 - 00:17:41.109, Speaker B: Were to go call up, like, you.
00:17:41.141 - 00:18:09.672, Speaker C: Figure out who, if you live in the US, you call up your member of Congress, you figure out who that is, call in and be like, hey, can I get the scheduler's email? I'd like to have a meeting to talk about my company, talk about what we're building. They will typically try and schedule that meeting, and if it's not with the member themselves, it'll be with staff. Someone like us. I think they very, very rarely turn down meetings, and I think they're not going and running to someone at the SEC to try and blow you guys up.
00:18:09.868 - 00:18:23.404, Speaker A: So the way to do this is literally like, go to the web, Google, like, who is my member of Congress? Figure this out. Go to the website, call someone and ask them for a meeting. And should people be offended if they get a meeting with staff as opposed to the member themselves?
00:18:24.184 - 00:18:56.596, Speaker D: No, the member's got to focus on every single issue that's out there possibly. And that's why they're staff, to sort of specialize a little bit better on that. And depending on the office, the staff can have a lot of say in what happens and recommends to the member what to do. And to a great extent, the members trust their staff and the staff has kind of proven themselves about their competency, an issue or what to recommend the member do. So you're still channeling kind of directly to the member when you're meeting with.
00:18:56.620 - 00:19:46.924, Speaker B: Staff and the member is kind of binary. Like, the only thing you need from the member is the. Yes. Like, all of the details about what the policy is going to be are going to be worked out at the staff level. The member just needs to care about the thing and say like, yes, Arjun, you can work on crypto regulation, but then once that happens, it becomes largely a committee staff issue where they're working on the technical details because, I mean, members understand that policy has to be very detailed and very technical, are happy with letting the people that have that expertise do it. And since you mentioned going on the members website, I'll say while you're on the website, there's always a tab called issues. Click on their issues tab, see a couple issues that they care about, and then figure out how to tell your story in a way that makes it so that you're doing something good on those issues.
00:19:46.924 - 00:20:31.820, Speaker B: I think the hit list thing is the double edged sword because I've definitely had people come in, make a pitch thinking that they're saying one thing, but I hear something else. Like, I hear, like, oh, this is going to create an even wider gap between the have and the have nots because it's going to make it easier for certain people to invest in products that others won't. And then you realize, like, all right, maybe this isn't something that we want. So I don't think you're automatically going to be on a hit list. But if you go to the. So, for example, we were talking about the broker regulations that treasury recently put out. A lot of people went into treasury and said, like, oh, one of the reasons these regulations are terrible is because they ruin the anonymity that crypto and blockchain allows.
00:20:31.820 - 00:20:49.154, Speaker B: And treasury doesn't care about anonymity. Right? Like, in fact, treasury wants to know information about people so that they can collect taxes from them. So pitching treasury about their regulations being bad for anonymity is not the way to convince them, but it's not going.
00:20:49.154 - 00:20:51.130, Speaker A: To put them on an audit list. Right.
00:20:51.282 - 00:21:10.722, Speaker B: I mean, if I'm a treasury employee and I learn about a way that a particular protocol is, like, helping people trade crypto anonymously, then maybe a flag might get raised in my head, like, oh, no, I need to figure out how I can get information about those people so that I can make sure that I can collect taxes from them.
00:21:10.898 - 00:21:27.276, Speaker C: On this, I think there's, again, there's a distinction between, like, treasury, which is like, an agency, and, like, a member of Congress who just some people, like, they're in the details. And, like, their job is to, like, stop terrorist financing. That's like, what they, their job. So, like, meeting with them, or, like.
00:21:27.300 - 00:21:28.012, Speaker B: If you have a meeting with, like.
00:21:28.028 - 00:21:56.888, Speaker C: An agency, like, you know, bring your experts and be ready to, like, really get into the details. Member of Congress. Like, really just be, it's about the narrative and, like, getting them to care. Like, what's your why? Right? So, like, we have members on our committee who are from, like, rural Indiana or, like, rural Idaho or, like, you know, some people are from, like, the Bay Area, but, like, they're from all across. They care about lots of different things. And so just, like, really convincing them, like, members, it's like, why should I care? And, like, that's the question you need to be answering for treasury. It's like, hey, this is the mission of treasury.
00:21:56.888 - 00:22:03.480, Speaker C: Like, how are you helping or hurting this mission? Like, those are two different conversations, just, like, know which you're having before you go in.
00:22:03.632 - 00:22:14.954, Speaker A: Can we talk about money in politics for a second? I think there's the thought that to engage in politics successfully, you need to have money and be willing to spend it. Is that true? What do you think, Arjun?
00:22:17.134 - 00:23:08.410, Speaker B: I think it could help, but I don't think it's necessary. I think it's one of many tools that you have at your disposal to influence members of Congress. I'm going to get the saying wrong, but there's some saying about shoe leather, and I don't know how the saying goes, but it has to do with the different ways. One way that you can influence members of Congress is by walking the halls of Congress and taking lots and lots of meetings. If you do like what Mike said, if you go onto the website of every member of Congress and every senator and you request a meeting to talk about your issue, making a connection with their constituents, you will get 90% of those meetings, maybe higher than that. And then if you go and you take each one of those meetings, they'll be 30 minutes long each, and you make a solid pitch that'll do work that no amount of money. Actually not no amount of money, but that'll do work that insane amounts of money will do.
00:23:08.410 - 00:23:39.464, Speaker B: Money will get you in the door, but you don't need money to get in the door. And even if you have money that gets you in the door, once you're in the door, you still have to make a good pitch. Right? Like, there's. DC is not, again, another reason that DC is not like house of cards. DC is not. It may seem that way, but DC is not so corrupt that if you give a member money, they're going to do something against the interest of their constituents or themselves. They're going to do what's right for them and they're happy to take your money and then not do the thing that you asked for because they're not supposed to do the thing that you asked for, in fact, that would be the least corrupt way to do this.
00:23:39.464 - 00:23:53.864, Speaker B: So I'd say money can get you in the door, but there are other ways to get in the door, and it's not a necessary way. And even if you use money to get you in the door, you still have to do other things to, like, close the deal.
00:23:54.404 - 00:24:06.444, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the way I heard described once was it's sort of like having a 4.0 at a college or high school. Like, it helps you get the job, but it's not. It's not necessary. Right. There's tons of different ways to get a job.
00:24:06.444 - 00:24:11.424, Speaker A: There's tons of different ways to get that kind of access. And so it's like one potential path forward.
00:24:11.724 - 00:24:22.790, Speaker B: And if you have a 4.0 and are an asshole in the interview, you're not going to get the job if you have a ton of money, but then at the meeting with the member, you make some idiot point, you're not going to get your bill passed.
00:24:22.862 - 00:24:57.284, Speaker A: That's true. There are famously lots of people who have a lot of money and are assholes that people in DC don't want to work with. I want to. Okay, so we've talked a lot about how do you engage, how do you get the foot in the door? How does it actually, like, this access actually work? Now let's talk about what it means to make a law. And each of you has worked on crypto legislation in different capacities. Take me from the moment where it's like, okay, this issue has been raised. What does it actually look like to craft the bill and what is happening in the mechanics of that moment and maybe a little bit of the office politics and who you're working with to put them together.
00:24:57.284 - 00:24:59.968, Speaker A: Lynn, I know you had a story here.
00:25:00.016 - 00:25:32.984, Speaker D: Yeah, I can start. So I started in Senate banking committee in early 2021. Senators, that was just pre Lumas, Jill Brand, I think senators hadn't quite talked about crypto much at all. And on the Senate banking committee is Elizabeth Warren. And it's funny, she hadn't actually engaged on crypto before then, before two years ago. And so we put on a hearing called cryptocurrency. What is it good for? Honestly asking the question, trying to learn about it.
00:25:32.984 - 00:26:34.614, Speaker D: And that was the first time, to my knowledge, that she came out completely hostile and against crypto. And so she's railing on the industry and criticizing them. And Senator Toomey, who I worked for, was the ranking member, the highest ranking Republican on the committee, turned around to me and said something to the effect of isn't it ironic that the supposed champion of the little guy is railing on this new startup industry that can actually help empower individuals and free them from constraints that put on them by government or by corporations? Whereas the Republicans are typically seen as the champion of big business, like the allies of the banks, and they're the ones actually interested in this new innovation and a thing that could kind of upheave everything in financial services. And it's particularly interesting to work on crypto because in so many other issues, the battle lines are already drawn. You know how your member is going. You have to stick to that. In crypto, it's all over the place.
00:26:34.614 - 00:27:04.260, Speaker D: And there's both, on the republican side, the sense of individual empowerment that the government is not going to have to tell you what to do. On the Democrat side, it's also individual parliament. Corporations are not going to control you. You can have your own data. And so developing policies around this is super interesting and thoughtful. Members dive into it and learn about it before making a judgment. In terms of legislation, it's centered.
00:27:04.260 - 00:27:58.718, Speaker D: Toomey worked on a lot of stablecoin legislation. We saw that it was probably everyone across the aisle could agree there should be some type of additional oversight of stablecoin reserves and to ensure consumer protection and ensure at least people knew what they were buying and what was backing it. And so we started developing that and creating a framework for it, and it's progressed. Representative McHenry has been working on it in the House now, has passed a version of it out of committee. And so it's a very incremental process. I remember doing a bill related to regulating crypto exchanges like Coinbase four years ago, putting out something early on that. And now it's only kind of come to fruition to have a developed package that the leader of the house financial services is pushing and remains to be seen whether it can even get across the finish line these next two years.
00:27:58.718 - 00:28:10.754, Speaker D: But incrementally over that time, you're making progress and pushing that forward. And I think eventually it's inevitable that there'll be additional consumer protection for crypto exchanges.
00:28:11.054 - 00:28:24.614, Speaker A: Michael, I know you're working on some blockchain legislation right now in the energy and Commerce committee. Help me take the journey of where that's at right now and how that incremental process works. How are you shaping the legislation over time and what those mechanics look like?
00:28:24.694 - 00:28:30.638, Speaker C: Yeah, so I mean, just kind of like at a top line. Right? Like, what's the actual process of, like, a bill becoming law?
00:28:30.726 - 00:28:30.902, Speaker B: Right.
00:28:30.918 - 00:29:16.320, Speaker C: So you have, like, introduction, then it gets referred to a committee and then the committee will hold a hearing on it. That's where they bring in witnesses who are like academics or industry leaders, and then they'll talk about, you know, why this bill is needed or, you know, changes that should be made. You have the markup. So a markup is where you go through and you actually make like, different amendments. You change this sentence to mean this, and, you know, make adjustments to the bill based on the feedback you receive. Then there's a vote where you pass it out of committee, you send it to the floor, then there's like a full big vote on the floor, and then you send it over to the Senate. Same process in the Senate committee markup vote and then to the president.
00:29:16.320 - 00:29:40.924, Speaker C: So I think just kind of like understanding that that's like the process of how something becomes law. I think it's helpful to just kind of understand, like, where things are at in the process and when things are different, how. How they're different. And I think that'll help you understand. So for me, I sit on a committee. So the committee hearing and committee markup, that's what I really focus on. We've had two hearings on blockchain this year.
00:29:40.924 - 00:30:15.126, Speaker C: So specifically, we had one in June that focused on blockchain and web, three that Ryan Wyatt of Polygon testified at that you may have seen on crypto, Twitter. And then we had one in September that focused on the Department of Commerce. And so I think a lot of the challenge I think we're seeing in the US is that you kind of have two agencies that are. They're hammers, right? Like they're law enforcement agencies. They have a definition of what a nail is. And so they're just swinging at anything that meets that definition. And I think one challenge is that we don't have anyone offsetting that.
00:30:15.126 - 00:30:56.544, Speaker C: There's no positive force for promoting development, promoting deployment of blockchains, promoting. I mean, there's the electric capital report on how the US developer share has fallen from 40% of developers to 29% of blockchain devs. And I think that's something that the US government should be concerned about. We have some of the best technical talent in the world in Silicon Valley and throughout the United States, and yet we're losing market share in devs for blockchain. So we have a bill that would require the Department of Commerce to promote blockchains. And we've had. So it's through the hearing process and is moving to the markup stage tomorrow.
00:30:56.924 - 00:31:13.594, Speaker A: Amazing I also, I want to comment on how human a process this is. And so, Arjun, I would love to talk about just what the process of helping draft the lummis Gillibrand crypto bill was like for you. And anything surprising that happened through that with just being able to partner with folks across the aisle.
00:31:15.414 - 00:31:30.144, Speaker B: It was great. I was trying to think of a better word, but the way this came to us was Senator Lummis had been interested in blockchain and crypto for a long time.
00:31:30.254 - 00:31:32.004, Speaker A: And Senator Lummis was a Republican, right?
00:31:32.044 - 00:32:05.606, Speaker B: Yep. Senator Lummis is a republican senator. Senator Lummis is a Republican from Wyoming, and Senator Gillibrand is a Democrat from New York. Like those states have very little in common. One's a Democrat, one's a Republican, which are obviously opposites. But Senator Lummis was a person that was very good at doing exactly what we were talking about. She knew how to describe the potential here in a way that would resonate with Senator Gillibrand, which was, Senator Gillibrand really cares about helping people that are underbanked.
00:32:05.606 - 00:32:56.052, Speaker B: You'd be surprised at how many people in America don't have access to traditional banking products, which makes it hard to do things like save money and pay bills and buy things, especially in a city like New York, where you think the financial capital of the world is that there would be so many people that have trouble accessing basic banking products. So she made this pitch, and Senator Gillibrand asked me to look into it. And I met with Chris Land, who is Senator Lummis crypto expert. And honestly, like, if there is a person that you want to talk to in the Senate or in the House, obviously, Michael, but Chris Land is someone that you should talk to also. He may be one of the people that knows more about crypto and has been working on crypto policy for years. Even before the Senate, he was doing it in Wyoming. He's a real expert.
00:32:56.052 - 00:33:42.194, Speaker B: He had a huge role in teaching me and in helping me meet with a lot of you. And like Mike said, you, you learn about the issues, and then you figure out how to solve the perceived problems. And our bill is not marked up. It hasn't had a hearing. So we're really focusing more on building the framework for what a large, broad crypto regulatory framework would look like. And took that in various pieces, like, what do we do about tax? What do we do about securities? What do we do about commodities? What do we do about preventing money laundering? And there's a section that addresses each one of those. And Chris and I would just, on a weekly basis, meet with each other, meet with stakeholders.
00:33:42.194 - 00:34:48.844, Speaker B: Actually, there was a time when I was unable to attend a meeting in New York, and Senator Gillibrand, my boss, took Chris as a staffer to the meeting, which was, I mean, maybe still is, like, relatively unheard of in a town that's famous for, like, not being good at bipartisanship. So I feel like you made a really good point that the lines in the sand of partisanship have not been drawn with respect to crypto and web3, because people don't really know where they are, and people are approaching it more on an issue by issue basis. And I suspect that that's kind of what happened to Senator Warren. She probably got the first introduction to this as, oh, it's used for money laundering, it's used to finance terrorism, it's used for illegal sales of drugs and stuff or whatever it is, and realize, like, uh oh, this is an issue. Let me learn more about it. And then was inception to understand that, like, this is the kernel at the middle of this industry. And, like, we know about inception.
00:34:48.844 - 00:35:10.994, Speaker B: Like, it's hard to shake an idea that you came up with on your own, and that's kind of where we are now. Whereas people that come at it from the other end, like Senator Gilbrand, really see the potential in helping her constituents and people generally. And I think staffers are less bipartisan than you think. I think, like, the news makes it seem like we hate each other way more than we do.
00:35:11.334 - 00:35:13.766, Speaker C: Less partisan. Less partisan. More bipartisan.
00:35:13.790 - 00:35:26.654, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry. I think, like, staffers generally care about substantive policy issues and are happy to talk with another person that cares about substantive policy issues. Yeah. Just maybe have a little bit of faith.
00:35:26.734 - 00:36:00.854, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, on the stage, we have two people who at least have served for democrats and two people who serve for Republicans. And so I think it says a lot about the fact that we're all friends. I'll close by sharing a personal story over the last few minutes, and I would invite you all to share any that come to mind. I think it's really important to remember that Washington is a town run by humans, just like everyone here is human, and humans are imperfect creatures. And so policy is naturally the output of an imperfect process. And the first time I really realized this was when I had my first job in government, which was an intern at the White House in the Obama administration.
00:36:00.854 - 00:36:26.380, Speaker A: And they do, like, an intern photo every spring. They brought out all the interns, like, 100 of us. And President Obama was like, hey, I'll answer a few questions before we take the photo. So he picked up the mic, and it's a beautiful spring day in the Rose garden. And all of a sudden, like, mid answer, he, like, lets out a giant sneeze, and there's, like, a huge piece of snot that comes out of his mouth, and he's like, oh, no. He takes out his handkerchief. He, like, scrubs it up.
00:36:26.380 - 00:36:48.572, Speaker A: It's like, huge loogie. My friend behind us is like, dude, that's presidential snot. And it was just amazing to think, like, man, I struggle with spring allergies, and so does the president of the United States. We both are humans, right? And I think it's really easy to forget that when we think about all these people on tv and on the news. And so I'd love for anyone to chip in on their own. These people are human story.
00:36:48.668 - 00:37:29.832, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think so. One example that I have. So, in July, we sent a bipartisan letter through the chair of the subcommittee that I specifically work on. So it was a bipartisan letter with the chair and the ranking member, and we sent this letter to Apple about their App Store policies and the ways that they were potentially prohibiting innovation and the adoption of blockchain in broader society. So we sent the letter and we put out a tweet, and crypto Twitter got on it. It got, like, 600 likes or 700 likes. Myrt isn't even blinking at this level of likes on a tweet.
00:37:29.832 - 00:38:04.372, Speaker C: But it was one of his most liked tweets in years, and he came back and was like, whoa, all right, let's do more of this. They are human, and having something blow up on Twitter is a good incentive for them. So in the same way that you guys should be just calling people and asking for meetings, if you see something on Twitter just like it, retweet it. Tell your friends to go like it and retweet it because it's not that hard, but it definitely has an impact because people will notice, like, okay, well, maybe we do another tweet like that. Maybe we send another letter because it's just like, a human incentive that people want to be liked and want to go viral.
00:38:04.508 - 00:38:07.212, Speaker A: The trash talk on Twitter, I think, has a negative impact also.
00:38:07.308 - 00:38:08.544, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say it, too.
00:38:10.884 - 00:38:13.224, Speaker A: Any other stories we want to share before we close out?
00:38:14.344 - 00:38:48.424, Speaker D: Upside down, disattached head. Tom Emmer was my humanizing story, but I would. Congress has a thing called recess, where Congress concludes and everyone goes home to their districts, and we get criticisms of, like, why does Congress have recess? Like, that's for kids. They go home and do nothing. If you saw the schedules of these members, like, I worked for Tom Emmer on the campaign prior to him being elected, and it was Minnesota, big, pretty big state. I would get up at 03:30 a.m. To drive to him, to get there by 415, to drive him to the Twin Cities, to get there for early breakfast.
00:38:48.424 - 00:39:12.374, Speaker D: I would take naps in the middle of the day while he's like having a lunch somewhere. And then I would take him to like a dinner or a reception and then bring him home at like ten and then get to my place at like eleven and go to sleep. They're exhausting schedules and they, the good ones, work all the time for their constituents and so appreciate them to the extent you can.
00:39:12.994 - 00:39:14.414, Speaker A: Arjun, any last stories?
00:39:15.154 - 00:40:00.330, Speaker B: Not a story, but I think like an example of everybody's people is that as people, everybody is good at some things and not as good at other things. And you can't be good at everything. And in the way that you guys are really good at blockchain and web3 and tech, we're good at drafting policy or whatever it might be, maybe it's good at politics. And there are so many subjects that. So, for example, I worked at a committee before I worked for Senator Gilbrand, and I was doing tax policy for a broad range of industries, from international compliance to renewable energy to blockchain to childcare. And I was not good at any one of those things. As a person that just did childcare or just did blockchain or just did whatever it is.
00:40:00.330 - 00:40:24.178, Speaker B: And it's your responsibility. I mean, I guess it's not your responsibility, but like, if you want policy to be good, we need to hear about it from you. We're not gonna be able to learn it ourselves. I mean, like, if you put the onus on us to learn it from ourselves, we'll learn it from wherever it's easiest to learn from. Like Mike said, if you're not at the table, you're on the table. Yeah. So you're on the menu.
00:40:24.178 - 00:40:52.760, Speaker B: If you're, if you're not the one that's teaching us about it, then the person that is teaching us about it are the ones that are going to have the say. And there are just as many people that are anti crypto and anti blockchain as there are that are pro crypto and pro blockchain. And trust me, they are doing work to teach us about why this is just for money laundering. So if you're not there to, like, make these points. We're only going to hear a one sided story, and, you know, you only have yourselves to blame. So. I like this guy.
00:40:52.832 - 00:41:02.494, Speaker A: Yeah. I love the spirit in the front row. That's a great note to wrap it up on. Everybody, please give a big round of applause to our three panelists. They put a lot of effort to get in here. Thank you guys so much.
