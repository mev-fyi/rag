00:00:08.920 - 00:00:12.862, Speaker A: But as the industry pre, now and then, before the infrastructure comes in, we gotta figure out what the hell we.
00:00:12.878 - 00:00:14.194, Speaker B: Need to use infrastructure for.
00:00:17.774 - 00:00:24.994, Speaker C: So do you guys think that the killer app is already out there? It's just in the 1995 form of a single HDMI?
00:00:27.114 - 00:00:48.370, Speaker B: I don't think so. If you look at what's mainly going on in that space, it seems like it's games after cryptokitties and decentralized exchanges, which are cool, but I think the best ones are semi decentralized to be able. So I think we're still using the sort of old world models and everyone says there'll be some new world model nobody's thought of yet.
00:00:48.442 - 00:00:50.274, Speaker A: That can be true, but I also.
00:00:50.314 - 00:00:56.994, Speaker B: Think lifting things out of the old world and cleaning them up, blockchain is good and will happen.
00:00:59.854 - 00:01:36.234, Speaker A: I'm seeing gaming as being a big use case. So gambling and gaming, two distinct areas. Gaming being like a fortnight and gambling being gambling online. And then obviously identity, I think identity is something which is in the blockchain. Look, firstly, I think this is my thesis for years now, since I started. One of the best uses of blockchain is voting. So if you can, if you get a situation where people didn't have to go to a voting booth and go on these silly machines and black box, no one knows what goes into it.
00:01:36.234 - 00:01:55.756, Speaker A: That's in the sophisticated parts of the world. Other parts of voting is all done and people counting and recounting and recounting. Whether they're not sure you can do global voting on a blockchain and have instant results, like indisputable, no double spins, no double quotes.
00:01:55.900 - 00:01:57.436, Speaker B: People can independently check their vote on.
00:01:57.460 - 00:02:34.566, Speaker A: Muffin shorts in the right address, and no one's ringing an election. And one of the things around voting, which is, I think is powerful, is that the regulators always go, why don't someone steals your phone? Okay, well, maybe that will throw in a lecture of 50 people, 100 people, when you have 300 million people. It's a lot of vote stealing in one day that has to happen for the votes to go the wrong way. And so it's really, really hard to do that. I mean, the other argument is hacking. Hacking, you know, a highly fragmented Android and any iOS space, putting malware on all these machines, all these devices. And in real time, bringing a vote is going to be difficult at scale.
00:02:34.566 - 00:03:13.852, Speaker A: So I think when you look at democracy and how it scales, I think blockchain, one of the most powerful things blockchain can do to the world is deliver democracy and the thesis behind business. If you have 100 people and they all have to spend, let's say, 4 hours to face the vote, it's worth it for them. Everyone has 1% of the vote. When you have 300 million people and they want to spend 4 hours to go vote, and your vote is now 0.001% of the vote, the value for your time isn't worth it anymore. So democracy doesn't scale. The bigger we get in society, the cost to vote and what the perceived value is in the vote, it becomes hard as society is bigger.
00:03:13.852 - 00:04:11.504, Speaker A: So what has to happen is the cost of voting has to come down. It has to be so easy to do the 60 seconds on your device. Everyone incentivizes to do it because the cost is now equivalent to the result and the value that you get out of it versus spending more hours to test the vote. This is why we have a situation in our country and other countries in the world where democracy doesn't scare well, because people who feel disenfranchised by the democratic system, they want to participate, they don't want to invest the hours of time from South Africa. And it was amazing when Mandela was released how people would stand in line for three days to go place their first impaired boat in some places. And so it's amazing how the personal sacrifice at that point in time was to spend two or three days when you come just to go. We can take society forward in the next five or ten years.
00:04:11.504 - 00:04:19.604, Speaker A: And obviously the costume and the day you need a salon to blockchain and do that, that would be amazing. And that's one of the key.
00:04:28.224 - 00:05:07.546, Speaker B: I can always say, I know from the past that there was a study in the US for people that drive to vote. Your chances of dying in a car accident were higher than your chances of matter decided. So identity, this gets back to identity, because I know some governments are looking at law school based identity, and identity is really tricky. Everybody knows it's not a single unitary good. You don't lose one identity everywhere, all things. You also don't want your identity to be recorded as a fingerprint on all your private browsing. So there's a sort of dance between identity and ambiguity and pseudonymity.
00:05:07.546 - 00:05:12.414, Speaker B: And I think that's going to become even more important as we scale watches.
00:05:13.554 - 00:05:58.282, Speaker C: So that brings me to my next question again, why I'm building this thing is, I hate that my nest knows my Google account. It's just the stupidest thing in the world. Why can't we just sell, generate some key pairs and activate this device? So I think where blockchain can actually matter is where we can kind of replace these central authorities of identity and have these self generated key parachutes. And so my next question is, especially with you guys, where does blockchain actually matter? So far it sounds like I'm just poking you. Well you could just use cassandra, right? You can really aggregate data there.
00:05:58.458 - 00:06:34.138, Speaker B: So we're definitely semi centralized because Ethereum and we started now we don't want to put every transaction on the chain. Mainly for the reason I mentioned. You would be fingerprinted, right. If your micro contributions through grave to your top sites on YouTube and Twitch channels is all recorded in from an address that you control and probably identify. So we use the zero knowledge proof protocol to centralize accounting server separately. We put one transaction every 30 days. Use your on time if you participate in this and that goes to uphold our seminal partner.
00:06:34.226 - 00:06:36.074, Speaker A: And they actually optimize that off chain.
00:06:36.154 - 00:07:00.184, Speaker B: So we're using, period, very little now there is on chain here to be able to flow during settlement. Also moving toward people who just want to get their tokens. They don't want to have an exchange, they don't want to have a hole as the KYC. That's why we're part of the civic Kyc. But you can see there's a need to preserve anonymity that you're in.
00:07:01.924 - 00:07:03.348, Speaker A: Even this week we're talking to people.
00:07:03.396 - 00:07:14.164, Speaker B: About zero knowledge proof systems, things, gate channels, things like that. And I think a lot of these approaches are portable across major chains so you can compose them scalable.
00:07:15.264 - 00:07:23.248, Speaker A: Yeah, I think privacy is another use case and it's kind of a weird esoteric horizontal use case in blockchain.
00:07:23.296 - 00:07:24.656, Speaker B: But privacy is one of the key.
00:07:24.680 - 00:08:11.244, Speaker A: Things that we like about blockchain. Everything from money to identity to payments. The ability to set your identity in a private manner with people who you are. It's very important, especially the browser product, the sites you browse, whether you have got some disease or affliction or whatever, these are things that are private, personal to you. And you want to upgrade the model of advertising, which is what's crazy ways like I've been picked up by some of the ads I've seen recently. Like I was trying to help a family member with alcohol problems. I'm doing it for like substance addiction tenants in South Africa.
00:08:11.244 - 00:08:33.428, Speaker A: And it's kind of creepy advertising and closing off the truth at all. And so sometimes, and then the other thing is like what profile are you building around you right when you do these things often you're googling something because you've never heard the word before.
00:08:33.476 - 00:08:34.264, Speaker B: You Google.
00:08:36.444 - 00:08:39.344, Speaker A: And the ad start following along.
00:08:48.044 - 00:09:15.204, Speaker B: With brave. So post from red. A few weeks ago somebody was shopping for airline tickets. $1,900 for the ticket. You have non private tab in Chrome or credit card. $7,000 in an inclusive tab in Chrome or private tab in Brave, $1,400 in a tour tab in grave price discrimination is real. Probably off Internet barf all dressing afraid.
00:09:18.764 - 00:09:53.884, Speaker C: I bought perforated metal ones and then so one of the questions I was asked the panel yesterday was what are we going to talk about next year? So I'm curious what you guys like, what? You know, everybody, we've been talking about scalability forever. So I'm confident we'll solve it. So wondering what's going to be next? What's the important thing in your mind?
00:09:55.944 - 00:10:21.880, Speaker B: So for us, not least more decentralization, we can push parts of our system like the zero knowledge proof system. We can push peer to peer settlement punching for people who want to go pure crypto. And there are some of our creators and publishers who do want crypto. Most of them, you know, all the big ones you like, Guardian, Washington Post, they're not even business partners.
00:10:21.912 - 00:10:23.000, Speaker C: They just came and verified.
00:10:23.032 - 00:10:24.112, Speaker B: They live in a domain and they.
00:10:24.128 - 00:10:26.048, Speaker A: Get paid, but they don't want tokens.
00:10:26.096 - 00:10:54.064, Speaker B: The legal, it and finance departments do not want crypto for various reasons. I know this is shocking. I don't get paid for this. Getting by with maximalist say this is my problem, that's your job, maximal. Let's go for it and convert the world. But the fact is a lot of businesses just want fiat. So I think for us and still be this exchange partner or setup partners uphold could be others.
00:10:54.064 - 00:11:14.484, Speaker B: Seeing banking move forward towards blockchain is important to this because I think we'll meet in the middle at some point and next year we'll probably be talking about your interesting financial services and e commerce and not just everybody.
00:11:17.664 - 00:12:06.544, Speaker A: Well, first we have to get through the next couple months and price decline because what's interesting now is, you know, that's me. If you look at the previous, the previous cycles and this is my third or fourth day month and it's not gaming, it's like this is what evolves when you hit the bottom. Like even now everyone's like it's not quite the bottom when people are going, it's like the bottom is when the majority of people think it's dead and we keep working hard to build it up. That's when I don't think there's one we'll see. But the nice thing is when you hit the bottom, I always look at the blockchain tourists. They're going to go home, right. You will stay behind the locals and ones you build infrastructure for the next big run infrastructure.
00:12:06.544 - 00:12:27.414, Speaker A: So trying to figure out ways that people can use like blockchain and bitcoin and whatever technology without knowing they're using it. As policy goes mainstream, crypto today is still too difficult for the average person to use. Every time you get close to 120, much higher than the rest of the.
00:12:27.414 - 00:12:28.166, Speaker C: World sits at 100.
00:12:28.230 - 00:12:28.622, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:28.718 - 00:12:55.586, Speaker A: And so when you look at, when you look at the average person out there, I don't know if you guys have tried doing this to like non technical family members and ask them to like download a wallet and transfer coins. The metaphors around the stuff is so they don't understand the aviation, they don't understand volatility issues. They don't want to be part of this ecosystem because it's just very complex for them. Surprisingly, this is a mainstream.
00:12:55.690 - 00:12:56.394, Speaker B: There's two ways.
00:12:56.434 - 00:13:31.644, Speaker A: One is to simplify the UX and Uis of crypto today, which honestly is going to take a while. And even Coinbase has done a pretty good job of it. But yeah, the user base isn't and people, that's. That said, if we could figure out how to play crypto, something like a TCP, IP protocol, HTTPS, etcetera, and be able to just use it when we're doing stuff and I'm running, it's all crypto in the background.
00:13:34.264 - 00:13:49.054, Speaker B: Definitely the Internet for, for me, it goes back to the late seventies when I was using the ARPANET and it was all attached to, but it was the web that really made it usable. I think we did that blue link on and ease of use.
00:13:52.914 - 00:13:54.730, Speaker A: So I'm just curious, how many of.
00:13:54.762 - 00:14:04.884, Speaker C: You, like, manage your own private key, like actually old? That's awesome. It's probably the highest percentage population sample.
00:14:07.104 - 00:14:09.536, Speaker A: But what worries me, keeps me up.
00:14:09.560 - 00:14:30.104, Speaker C: In mind is bringing in portfolios, group of state systems with these, like, you know, virtual six months to a year. So there's going to be tons of zero days that we'll own all these private keys. So I'm very curious what will happen next year in regards to security in terms of actually deploying these.
00:14:32.364 - 00:14:32.908, Speaker B: In terms.
00:14:32.956 - 00:14:46.504, Speaker C: Of like, how do you guys feel about security these days? We're kind of taking all these new infrastructure projects like mine.
00:15:07.914 - 00:15:12.574, Speaker B: What I've seen is security will be guaranteed for our grandchildren.
00:15:15.594 - 00:15:17.034, Speaker C: There's going to be an end to.
00:15:17.114 - 00:15:59.864, Speaker B: Zero days, virtual machines. So there is. I've always been working with this context, but getting all your trusted computer, whether it's what assembly, what you have to do to the. The privacy problem is an issue. I mentioned earlier, a lot of energy. They expect to go back to their bank and recover their passwords. They expect to have the ability to dispute a charge.
00:15:59.864 - 00:16:07.864, Speaker B: These importances probably have to be there. So that's a different level of security code basin.
00:16:12.264 - 00:17:15.324, Speaker A: Well, I mean, so something. So giving us a while, we want to be able to use your identity and because we're not storing data on you, it's just giving the tools to do it. But there are other services out there as well, for society, I guess. You know, when you look at overall security and blockchains right now, the real question on decentralization versus decentralization and proof of work is it's all over the place because of obviously hardware manufacturing being largely centralized in China through the domain, and now Japan's up here in the UK. But bitcoin is the most secure chain today because of my hash power. Like run a physical hardware, you would need to go do a separate bitcoin. It's not actually available today.
00:17:15.324 - 00:18:13.478, Speaker A: So at scale, that's the most secure blockchain. But obviously there are bitcoin as well. So you can now currently it's attached to bitcoin. But realistically, five tips and a hash power. I'm personally surprised at how little interchange and tax have been using hash power up to now. Which makes believe that the economic interests of the mining or people who are aligned with the way they're mining and going, taking other trades, which means there are no real hostile actors in the market yet. Because when hostile actors come in, when governments start buying this stuff, all hell is going to break loose.
00:18:13.478 - 00:18:39.984, Speaker A: I guarantee you. When you have World War three, whatever it looks like, and government charter to cash power, and they can bitcoin themselves, this is the stuff that's really interesting. At that point, trust goes out the window. You don't trust the money pool or the korean government's money pool either. There's no trust involved. You have to value all your own box. You have to check everything yourself.
00:18:39.984 - 00:19:08.324, Speaker A: This becomes very scary. So while we're in a good space where everyone's economically aligned and it's all about money, for now, that's great. And they don't care whether the outcome isn't financial, it's national security. The moment some people suffering national security are the reason to take something.
00:19:13.084 - 00:19:16.464, Speaker B: National security is the root password of the US constitution. Right.
00:19:26.924 - 00:19:30.984, Speaker A: I'm interested in whether it is outside.
00:19:33.204 - 00:19:54.724, Speaker B: China. And I could have. It seems like there's new consistent protocols. Anybody here heard of avalanche? Yeah, not too many. So, you know, gossip based. Seems like it's a new class of consensus protocols that can possibly help us with scalability and other things.
00:19:55.544 - 00:19:56.764, Speaker A: Resistance to.
00:20:01.344 - 00:20:03.624, Speaker C: Technically not a consistent thing.
00:20:11.244 - 00:20:15.864, Speaker B: The consensus thing on bitcoin is not just the puzzle song, that's the longest chain.
00:20:23.684 - 00:21:06.868, Speaker A: Because everyone sounds like there's a lot of different views on how. So what's really fastidized? I think the way we do consistency is replacing. Okay, if you think about this way, the original design at bitcoin, the way it's supposed to play out, my understanding was you can have different implementations of bitcoin being run by miners, etc. And you can disagree on rules, but basically the economic costs to not follow along this chain was just so high that obviously a revolt could happen anyway. You would follow along the chain. The majority of cash bonds supported it. The moment you have reframe, it's a whole different network trading every single time.
00:21:06.868 - 00:21:08.944, Speaker A: So all these books are bitcoin right now.
00:21:10.164 - 00:21:11.716, Speaker D: Bitcoin. So the longest chain doesn't matter.
00:21:11.740 - 00:21:39.784, Speaker A: So some bitcoin cash, people go, well, it's the longest chain. Well, it doesn't matter. It's a separate input. And even if it was the longest trade with the most creative port, it wouldn't matter because you're no real because it's a secondary. So, you know, and the way you maintain this state is by forcing people to have one implementation client on any of these chains. And this is why it's really interesting when you're looking at different cash.
00:21:42.924 - 00:21:43.188, Speaker D: I.
00:21:43.196 - 00:21:59.594, Speaker A: Don'T think it's going to happen. At least there's diversification in that network. But in other networks, there's just a single implementation client. So how do you ever get to the point where true consensus is being judged? Because the focus all using reputation.
00:22:01.654 - 00:22:17.734, Speaker B: Sure. The technical point was that proof of work is an anti spam, that you need something else to get consensus across networks, different rules. And we also know about bitcoin bugs, where they were about to forecast.
00:22:19.234 - 00:22:36.662, Speaker C: Yeah, there's. I mean, I honestly don't think malice will play a lot of role in like, you know, the failures that we're gonna see because like, am I not right? That was just censoring everything. I think those kinds of attacks are gonna be a lot more unlikely.
00:22:36.858 - 00:22:37.982, Speaker B: They can look like accidents.
00:22:38.038 - 00:23:12.130, Speaker A: They can be absolutely. In the short term, given the size of the industry and the money at play. Everyone is focused on the economics of blockchain in their mining. The moment we move to the point where it's not about the economics, guys. Oil has been the perfect example of how something which should be economically driven is not actually funded, manipulated by strategic global interests, not because of the money. It never has been. It's always about strategic reserves for governments around the world.
00:23:12.130 - 00:23:17.934, Speaker A: And that's caused more wars, more debts than any other district. And I think blockchain is not going to be good.
00:23:18.514 - 00:23:21.414, Speaker C: I'd like to get us back to the tarnished.
00:23:23.594 - 00:23:26.134, Speaker A: Happy thoughts.
00:23:26.594 - 00:23:54.498, Speaker C: So while it was working, welcome. And feature films, if you guys ever know, I ran so it's called root. I was a core kernel developer. This thing was really cool. It was all in c with handwritten c cable. But over about six months, we went from 80% feature phone sales to 20. As the smartphone market condition exploded.
00:23:54.498 - 00:24:05.894, Speaker C: Do you guys see like adoption happening? Like in a trickle? Kind of what I remember the Internet in the nineties and the early aughts. Or do you see it as like a bang? Like.
00:24:10.074 - 00:24:40.174, Speaker B: It took Apple to do that, right. Erickson had a glass slab with everyone touch on. It didn't take off. So everyone's expecting that there'll be some Apple are glasses that will be super cheap and light, don't require a battery. That's going to be a ways out. I think just businesses are so I don't know what the new killer device does that a lot of people I talk to, investors say, oh, we're in consolidation. There won't be any iPhone.
00:24:43.754 - 00:24:48.094, Speaker C: Do you see the adoption crypto happening kind of faster?
00:24:49.034 - 00:25:08.578, Speaker B: We're doing our best. I think it's software now, if it's true, and probably as microscopically, but there's consolidation, there are physical limits. We're running the two wars that we now have to work on the software and software sucks, right? I've been doing it for a long time. I remember when all the classic arcade games fit in 4k or eight k.
00:25:08.666 - 00:25:09.986, Speaker A: And those were the best case.
00:25:10.130 - 00:25:17.712, Speaker B: And now we have like a million times more network memory and cpu. Is software a million times better? No way.
00:25:17.808 - 00:25:22.736, Speaker A: In some ways it's different. It's different because you can talk to everybody in the world. That's awesome.
00:25:22.800 - 00:25:31.084, Speaker B: People out of college, it used to be a lot better than gay libraries. So that's not even exponentially bad, just totally different.
00:25:32.024 - 00:25:32.600, Speaker A: For sure.
00:25:32.672 - 00:25:41.184, Speaker B: I'm a fan, but the software we use every day to do simple things like money or browsing the web compared to.
00:25:53.084 - 00:26:22.944, Speaker A: The level of obfuscation that's required and what the mass market means. And we're still trying to figure out what that is. And so Brendan's building it into brave browser. It's kind of sitting in the background. It's called to the experience. It's more like the attention and I'd say disrupting the ad industry collaborate and it's a very big ambition product. But the core software brave is using is a browser.
00:26:22.944 - 00:26:56.582, Speaker A: People understand, they're very familiar with it. The extra stuff in the end is going to take a while to get massive adoption. But if people just trust the brave browser, it's better, safe and more secure browser that he wins. And that's one way of driving adoption, because in the back end, consumers using crypto, they have no idea they're actually doing that now to the right extent. With civic as well. We've all eating stuff which like in our apps and just generally we don't try mention blockchain, etcetera and those things we're trying to. I think that layer of obfuscation needs to happen more and more with consumer products.
00:26:56.582 - 00:28:02.184, Speaker A: You can build these consumer products and make it better, but the key thing is you have to ask yourself, what are you actually changing? Like why is it better than a centralized database? And from a user experience perspective, does it change or improve the experience? And if not, then while you're competing on what is it faster, is it cheaper? Is it the pricing? At the end of the day, you just don't know. Why do you do blockchain? It doesn't change the UX competitive product. I don't see how that helps you blockchain. So it has to change at least the experience or what is possible capable of them being. This is why doesn't make sense unless there's a real reason for it. From a UX perspective, and not always ux, maybe there's like bitcoin to argue. Obviously the money is essential, et cetera, and there's some use cases there.
00:28:02.184 - 00:28:14.904, Speaker A: But outside of that, I'm still struggling to see all the consumer action and I'm starting to see how we actually change the product that's being built visibly regular database.
00:28:18.084 - 00:29:06.836, Speaker B: What we're doing with the token is, like Vinny said, kind of automated and go set. We'll give you grants and trickle back towards your favorite sites and creators. You have to often do it, but it's going to be in the top of the new user interface, so it won't be in the settings. We can probably make it even more discoverable in the sense that when you go to our publishers, there's also opportunities to buy things. A lot of publishers are getting screwed, frankly, by ad assisting players like Google, Facebook. They want to start charging people, but it's really hard to get people to open their wallet, even conventional credit card, to subscribe for an annual subscription, $250, $37 a month. How much easier would it be if you just had a few tokens already in your wallet and you just go there and get margin? That's one of the things we're trying to do.
00:29:06.836 - 00:29:17.504, Speaker B: So there are advantages that depend on blockchain is infrastructure, but to the user just look like a lower friction to give some experience.
00:29:18.764 - 00:29:23.304, Speaker C: I think we're getting well on time. So does anyone have any questions.
00:29:56.824 - 00:29:57.280, Speaker B: Without.
00:29:57.352 - 00:29:57.964, Speaker D: Those.
00:30:03.744 - 00:30:08.764, Speaker B: Lines for social recovery management?
00:30:17.424 - 00:31:13.778, Speaker C: So I think this is where blockchain gets it, right. There's a similar, there's only a fix. Apply these, you can't, you know, can't duplicate them. So when I want to do this private, you know, subgenre keeper dance with my nest, I give it some tokens no matter what activates, right. And the fact that we don't have to like use some other near meteor to do this kind of coordination, I think is what's really key. Revolutionary. Yeah, I agree with you.
00:31:13.778 - 00:31:14.330, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:31:14.362 - 00:31:38.534, Speaker B: I mean, the old days of used, it used to say your public would be a bottom. Every post, some of it just checked by your reputation on the user didn't really look out for PGP. And I think the reputation on chain vision, which you should speak to more than me, is still kind of over the horizon. I'd like to see it happen. It's going to take a lot of reputation. It's going to be subject to, like I said.
00:31:53.454 - 00:32:24.694, Speaker A: So when we look at identity, identity first is attributes which you believe about yourself. True reputation is hard and so a good example is used. Is Nelson Mandela never considered self criminal, but he wasn't his. And so on his identity profile. He would have stolen families. By the way. These things came to a time in the eighties he wasn't.
00:32:24.694 - 00:32:36.760, Speaker A: Identity is very personal. So you need to be true about yourself and the reputation is what others believe to be true about you.
00:32:36.832 - 00:32:42.064, Speaker B: Certainly in terms of this, I tried like some of the stuff that y'all.
00:32:42.104 - 00:32:48.364, Speaker C: Had centralized, like.
00:32:56.364 - 00:33:01.064, Speaker B: Engineering, farewell sales, and it's important to have each of those different aspects of.
00:33:14.644 - 00:33:41.804, Speaker A: So what we did was just instead of having companies look up record blockchain value keys, we get, but it can be done directly available there where you don't have to go because we don't store your information. You can.
00:33:43.784 - 00:33:44.524, Speaker B: See.
00:33:46.464 - 00:33:48.124, Speaker A: This is why privileges sold.
00:34:13.344 - 00:34:17.204, Speaker B: We have somebody workshop too. So we're false.
00:34:18.504 - 00:34:19.524, Speaker C: Anyone else?
00:34:21.584 - 00:34:24.284, Speaker D: I'm just curious about why.
00:34:43.524 - 00:34:44.700, Speaker A: I think so.
00:34:44.812 - 00:35:14.324, Speaker C: I'm a bit contrarian. Everyone says that it's like dirty high energy, but energy demand and supplier to different problems. Someone's supplying, it's green, it doesn't matter where the demand comes from. And I'm actually building a pre state system. So like I don't even care about that. But my understanding of this at least is not even if all the synergies used for bitcoin, we can replace the trillions of dollars instead of moving money around. That money can go back to.
00:35:16.544 - 00:35:17.484, Speaker B: Our foot.
00:35:19.864 - 00:35:39.388, Speaker A: I'll share with you on that. But this is not necessarily my view, this is my interpretation of things. I've learned private conversations with people in the industry for a long time. And I think I would say, I wouldn't repeat it unless I believe substantially true to some extent. So firstly, a lot of the miners.
00:35:39.436 - 00:35:41.076, Speaker C: Who are working on bitcoin mining right.
00:35:41.100 - 00:35:46.140, Speaker A: Now, a lot of them by and large, when we can place it to get energy weight your other energy to be wasteful.
00:35:46.172 - 00:35:48.332, Speaker B: It's not really a little public consumption.
00:35:48.428 - 00:36:35.670, Speaker A: So for example, Iceland, even Norway, etcetera, and then other places. Because obviously these guys are all things, there are new power plants. It's not as simple as saying I think for at least a large portion of it from money. Some of the stuff is modeled and then going forward more and more, it's not wasted energy. The second part is bitcoin mining. This is a, you know, the un population is, you know, we like frogs and you know, the whole frog in one water scenario you throw a frog.
00:36:35.702 - 00:36:36.274, Speaker D: In.
00:36:38.774 - 00:36:44.834, Speaker A: And eventually, you know, the world there you throw into a part of pop water.
00:36:46.214 - 00:36:48.774, Speaker B: Because people differential.
00:36:51.674 - 00:37:29.428, Speaker A: Where. Because well when it was introduced there was a point where our energy consumption was pretty high and we wanted on the back path. But all of a sudden it's brought a lot of attention to the fact that if bitcoin price keeps growing and the industry keeps going into this, we're going to figure out ways to solve energy prices faster. Because now melting down the wall, it's an interesting theory and I hope it perspective. But the fact that we have these conversations now about energy consumption of bitcoin, how it's affecting the credit world buying, we wouldn't be having a discussion about it. We were going at the same pace we're going since 2009. Slowly, slowly, slowly using energy.
00:37:29.428 - 00:37:33.708, Speaker A: And look at the tech that's coming out of the energy efficiency chip.
00:37:33.756 - 00:37:34.664, Speaker D: Efficiency.
00:37:38.164 - 00:37:39.584, Speaker A: Is going to be.
00:37:52.784 - 00:38:19.340, Speaker B: These arguments are sort of like the cold war gave us highways or the moody project. There might be a set of panels. What I agree with when he tells Evelyn, she says it can't. Mathematical consensus is very interesting. And the idea of bitcoin is digital gold is pretty compelling. And gold mining is dirty too, with a dirtier, more energy intensive. But that can't be the last word.
00:38:19.340 - 00:38:23.344, Speaker B: That can't be the one size fits also poh.
00:38:24.724 - 00:38:30.428, Speaker C: Yeah, much more energy than. Yeah, I agree. There's a question for penny.
00:38:30.476 - 00:38:33.254, Speaker A: So you talked about emerging standards and.
00:38:35.314 - 00:38:38.098, Speaker B: Projects from neural perspectives.
00:38:38.186 - 00:39:47.264, Speaker A: You're looking to integrate identity as part of your project and you're evaluating things like unicorn software and civic like from your perspective, how would you think about it? What value? So I think all the countries in this space have got reasonably strong offerings. The real question is what focus do they have? We focus on in use cases in consumer, our competitors focus on more government or big corporate type limitations. Depends what you look for. But if you're a big corporate and you want to roll out this back end infrastructure for you, if you're attaching consumers and consumer use cases, we're probably better student verifications through the marketplace. So again, I think we're all sufficiently differentiated in the space that it will matter which one you choose long term, but in the short term whose roadmap suits what you immediately target. And so with Ray I think, you know we're consumer focused over there and I think this would make more sense that you work with maybe someone who's more focused from large.
00:39:48.524 - 00:39:51.934, Speaker B: Absolutely. Also the attestation on chain option is important.
00:39:58.714 - 00:40:43.584, Speaker D: Thank you. My question is frankly consumer based products were think about adoption. Isn't one big lost adoption that how would you fight this out for that?
00:40:44.124 - 00:41:04.864, Speaker B: We already do on iOS as you say, it turns out Android is our biggest OS by users. Windows 64 2nd iOS third which surprised me because not only does Apple aggressively tie, which is an antitrust term tying they tie the browser to the OS, they get the only default browser.
00:41:06.644 - 00:41:06.932, Speaker A: They.
00:41:06.948 - 00:41:57.772, Speaker B: Have to use their engine and ad blocking us to go through their content blocker model, the new version of the academical engine still I got them pretty privacy conscious and remember three OS thrust so something is still working there and I think it's a late user event. I haven't talked about this here, but crypto itself is the lead user. You get these people who are tech savvy, innovative and they pioneer a new category they invented. You like doing surface. Eric one hippo a lot of cloning tools will be embedded by performers lead user information for technological progress. So what you want to do is get that reduced consumer usability. You want to make new standards that a stubborn minority of lead users and their followers, their friends and family can then drive markets and we do that with Firefox.
00:41:57.772 - 00:42:06.544, Speaker B: Thought the browser market is over Internet Explorer forever. Microsoft had one that was before the iPhone. Now it's a different Microsoft. I think it's a stronger problem.
00:42:07.084 - 00:42:08.460, Speaker A: Nobody's talking about Microsoft.
00:42:08.492 - 00:42:16.584, Speaker B: So if you get stuck thinking we're always going to be in this pseudo memorial the way out is lead users. That's even more fun.
00:42:18.204 - 00:44:42.636, Speaker A: I recently switched back from using macro. I think one of the risks right now seen in certain values, certain value has become north in America and it's something that we always fought for years and years started with myself. I've been here for 15 years total living here for ten. And this place has changed literally has become what we hated about the rest of America. Lots of startups, lots of these financing the whole way through and your books today and because this power concentration I think we're massive hiring engineers in muscle because big guys making so much money this is the long way and that's not uncovered. How do you, how do you decide how do you give your guys to leave great jobs way more than what you can expect as a startup now possibility. It's just getting to the point right now where again corporate jobs are the best wealth right now basically create this instance of New York that you have to work with your company has been MACD because the capital markets are talking about global capital pool available and what I says you figure out is the state.
00:44:42.636 - 00:45:29.194, Speaker A: They haven't quite got the state financing part of the market and it's not school. Everyone's more than a first place by China. This corporate America risk is real. The fact that buying into a safari doesn't the US government step up and you can see Romney's already doesn't government say hey Amazon you're too big google you're too big Facebook and start tearing this guy down. I don't know but it's starting to look a lot more like corporate America.
00:45:29.894 - 00:45:31.502, Speaker B: I guess the feeling broke is going.
00:45:31.518 - 00:45:32.214, Speaker A: To do what Gates did.
00:45:32.254 - 00:45:40.790, Speaker B: Gates said what are these pendant congress people asking me the genius who give the world widows hard questions they should leave me alone or are going to fight them.
00:45:40.822 - 00:45:41.406, Speaker A: They fought them.
00:45:41.430 - 00:45:52.034, Speaker B: They turned out all we're in charge. When the sales alpha sales guy takes over the company. Steve Jobs said that's the end.
00:45:53.734 - 00:45:55.154, Speaker C: So on that note.
00:46:03.454 - 00:46:56.524, Speaker A: In particular one of the most exciting entrepreneurs I've met but I only did one deal with multiple capital and I'm so excited to see guys like we own both companies and have a vision to do stuff and do this in kick coming out of school. But Silicon Valley is still a great place. It's great for simple companies and to bring the right people together but you've got to be able to inspire and bring like super smart people. In other words and now by the way, I'm in San Diego as a result of the recent conference. San Diego might be the best company of both companies right now because we are fantastic super smart like Falcon level engineers coming out of the woodwork. They don't want to do the San Diego.
00:47:07.104 - 00:47:12.758, Speaker C: I think I want to thank everyone for coming. This is an awesome panel.
00:47:12.806 - 00:47:13.142, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:47:13.158 - 00:47:14.174, Speaker C: Vinnie and Brandon.
