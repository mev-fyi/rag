00:00:04.520 - 00:00:41.749, Speaker A: Today I'm joined by Solana girl, Amy. So please tell us, what are you building? I'm working as an intern at Cupcake right now, and Cupcake is a social gaming platform. It's a website you go to and you can play an endless reel of games as long as you have sugar. So Sugar is kind of like the web2 currency that you use in order to play games, and they fill up every 12 hours or so. So I'm doing a lot of utility based stuff right now. Since I'm an intern, I'm learning the code base and studying how to make the app a bit faster, a bit smoother, less annoying things you have to deal with. So really just learning how to build Web3 games from a really amazing team.
00:00:41.749 - 00:00:46.285, Speaker A: Awesome. I'm a big games fan. I definitely got to try it out. Go to cupcake.com and click play Game.
