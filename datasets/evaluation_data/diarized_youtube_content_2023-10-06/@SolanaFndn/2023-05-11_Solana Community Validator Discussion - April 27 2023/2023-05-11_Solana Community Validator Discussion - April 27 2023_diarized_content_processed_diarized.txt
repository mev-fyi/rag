00:00:03.000 - 00:00:50.334, Speaker A: All right, welcome everyone to the Solana community validator discussion, April 27, 2023. On the agenda today, we've got our normal validator updates, a small recap of the validator educational workshop that happened this week, and then scale three is going to demo their monitoring platform. So the scale three guys are here, they're going to take over and talk about what they've been working on. So first of all, updates, 113.7 is still recommended for mainnet beta. I believe as of last call we weren't quite there yet, but now we've gotten the over the majority of the cluster on 113.7 and the root cause analysis has been released.
00:00:50.334 - 00:01:34.488, Speaker A: So if you haven't had a chance yet, definitely take a look at this, uh, read through the outage root cause analysis. What happened there? Uh, there's a nice little TLDR at the top. Uh, essentially there was a big block that got created. Um, that big block would have been fine if, um, maybe some other block forwarding services weren't doing, uh, retransmission of that block. Um, so the combination of sort of some de duping logic that got a little bit overwhelmed and then the block forwarding that also sort of exacerbated the problem, led to the outage that happened. But you can read a lot more detail here. Yeah, that's pretty much it for Mainnet.
00:01:34.488 - 00:02:31.910, Speaker A: We're still kind of in a holding pattern on Mainnet until we go through the downgrade upgrade. Well, sorry, upgrade, downgrade upgrade plan that we're doing on Testnet, which I'll talk about next. So in Testnet 113.7 is also recommended at the moment, the plan here is to do a process on Testnet where we upgrade it to 114 seven, downgrade it back to 1.137, upgrade it again. On that final upgrade to one 1417, we are going to enable all of the features that are not yet enabled on Mainnet that we plan to enable. So we're going to enable all those features on Testnet, test it there, make sure everything runs well, and then assuming there's no bugs found, everything goes well, we'll do that same process on Mainnet.
00:02:31.910 - 00:02:52.864, Speaker A: So this is part of Tolly's blog post about how we're going to make sort of more comprehensive testing plan when we roll out new minor releases. So once, once this whole process is done on Testnet, then we'll be able to start the mainnet rollout. Any questions on other testnet or mainnet?
00:02:58.324 - 00:02:58.876, Speaker B: Cool.
00:02:58.980 - 00:03:30.374, Speaker A: All right, so yeah, a little recap on the validator educational workshop. Steve who's on the call led the workshop and went over important logs to look at when you're starting your validator up, kind of what they mean and how you can help. Just sort of see the progress your validator is making. If you want to check that out, there's a playlist right here that I will put in. Wait a minute. Gotta exit out here.
00:03:33.414 - 00:03:34.234, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:36.734 - 00:03:38.554, Speaker A: Put these in the.
00:03:40.614 - 00:03:42.474, Speaker B: Chat. There we go.
00:03:43.134 - 00:04:27.444, Speaker A: So definitely take a look if you haven't. It's been kind of passed around on discord a couple times already, so I think people are actually checking them out and getting some good info out of them. I personally thought the last workshop was pretty useful, but any questions or just feedback on the last one or we move on. Okay, one more plug here. Planning to do the next one on May 31. Don't have a topic or a presenter yet, but if anybody has a topic they're interested in or passionate about, want to teach or even just suggest, let me know. Uh, we've got about a month till the next one, so plenty of time to get something together.
00:04:27.444 - 00:04:39.764, Speaker A: Uh, we really like to keep these going on kind of a regular cadence because, you know, I think there's a lot of good content out there and people discover it after the fact, so pretty. Pretty good resource to have for the community.
00:04:44.864 - 00:04:45.992, Speaker B: All right, great.
00:04:46.088 - 00:04:57.114, Speaker A: Well, that's all the updates I've got. Um, hand it over to the scale three team. Let them introduce themselves. I'll just turn off screen share and let you all take over.
00:05:00.014 - 00:05:14.534, Speaker C: Sounds good. Thanks, Tim. And thanks to the Solana community for having us. Super excited today to walk you through a little bit about what we're building at scale three and show you the actual meat and potatoes of the platform. Can everyone see my screen okay?
00:05:14.694 - 00:05:15.590, Speaker B: Yep. Yep.
00:05:15.742 - 00:05:33.394, Speaker C: Awesome. Sounds good. So I'll walk you through with a very quick introduction, but my name is Jay Thakrar. I focus on product and strategy here at skill three. I'm joined by Yemi, my colleague, who is one of the senior blockchain engineers on the protocol side of the house. The best way to think about scale three, we're a web3 info company. We're building dev tools.
00:05:33.394 - 00:06:19.024, Speaker C: Our platform is what we like to call the DevOps platform for monitoring and maintaining your web3 infrastructure. So we're multi chain today, however, super excited to announce that we now have full feature support for Solana. So really excited to show you exactly what that means in terms of our team. We're a team of builders. We have deep experience between infra and blockchain experience primarily focused on crypto infra, so spent a lot of time around centralized and distributed computing, both at Coinbase consensys and other web two companies. In terms of our products today, again, I'll fly through this, but at a high level. We have a couple products that are live today and a few more that we're building, but we're basically building again the DevOps stack for monitoring your actual nodes.
00:06:19.024 - 00:06:43.544, Speaker C: Today we provide a product called autopilot. That's a one to one view of monitoring your nodes. We have alerting as well. We have the process, or a whole process for upgrading your nodes through a few clicks. We provide granular logs, and you can do this across multiple protocols. Our second product control center is a one to many view. So again, really interesting for those that are running multiple nodes for the foundation.
