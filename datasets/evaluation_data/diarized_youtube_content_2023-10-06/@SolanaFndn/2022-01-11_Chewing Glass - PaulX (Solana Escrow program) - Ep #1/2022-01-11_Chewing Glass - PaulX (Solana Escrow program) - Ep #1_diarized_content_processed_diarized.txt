00:00:00.520 - 00:00:01.486, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other.
00:00:01.510 - 00:00:02.502, Speaker B: We'Re not gonna make it.
00:00:02.598 - 00:00:05.230, Speaker A: Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off.
00:00:05.262 - 00:00:06.334, Speaker B: More than I can chew.
00:00:06.454 - 00:00:07.598, Speaker A: Most of the time, I work in.
00:00:07.606 - 00:00:14.742, Speaker B: A glass jar and lead a very uneventful life. A face full of glass hurts like hell when you're in it. That's weird. That glass looks half full to me.
00:00:14.798 - 00:00:15.318, Speaker A: Eating glass.
00:00:15.366 - 00:00:16.990, Speaker B: Eating glass is staring at the abyss.
00:00:17.102 - 00:00:17.874, Speaker A: Glass.
00:00:18.454 - 00:00:19.990, Speaker B: Who gives a shit about glass?
00:00:20.062 - 00:00:21.314, Speaker A: Who the fuck is this?
00:00:22.854 - 00:00:25.954, Speaker B: It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass.
00:00:26.854 - 00:00:29.354, Speaker A: I'm gonna get some safety goggles next time.
00:00:38.564 - 00:01:09.248, Speaker B: Hey, everybody, and welcome to Chewing glass, the show where we talk to Solana developers who have been building in the Solana ecosystem. We talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly. Today we have our very first and very special guest, Paul X. Paul X is actually the creator of the escrow program. The Solana escrow program. This program actually saved a lot of lives over the months. Back in the day, all that existed was Docs dot solana.com
00:01:09.248 - 00:01:15.284, Speaker B: and the Pawlux escrow tutorial, sometimes referred to as the Solana Bible. How's it going, Paul?
00:01:15.664 - 00:01:19.444, Speaker A: Yeah, hi. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I'm doing great.
00:01:20.104 - 00:01:46.012, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really great to have you. So just for context, like, Paul and I met probably about six months ago or five months ago when I first joined, I was writing a getting started blog post. I found out about the escrow tutorial. I wanted to talk to Paul to get some feedback and kind of really just kind of get my bearings about me for what's going on in the Solana ecosystem, and also more recently, had a chance to catch up with him in Lisbon unexpectedly.
00:01:46.068 - 00:01:46.812, Speaker A: So that was.
00:01:46.908 - 00:01:57.120, Speaker B: That was pretty great. I guess we're just. We're just going to dive right in. So I guess the first question I got for you, Paul, is, when did you get into blockchain?
00:01:57.312 - 00:02:37.914, Speaker A: First of all, I really enjoyed Lisbon as well and seeing it there, very cool. Just in general, the whole conference, it's really quite an experience, I think. I'm an undergrad in computer science, but I'm just. And I'm in my second year right now. So, like, last year, I was in my first year, and I felt like I wanted. I've been work. I had been working for like, a year already, or actually two, I think just, you know, part time next to university, but just regular full stack engineering.
00:02:37.914 - 00:02:55.366, Speaker A: But I kind of got bored. I wanted something more challenging, and I knew about crypto, so I thought that would be an interesting area to explore. And so that's what I did. I explored and. Yeah, cool.
00:02:55.390 - 00:03:07.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, that's kind of me. I kind of dove in about 2017. My first crypto purchase started kind of building around, like, 2018. Just out of curiosity, what was the first crypto that you ever purchased? We want. The people want to know.
00:03:13.594 - 00:03:19.706, Speaker A: Bitcoin, most likely. I don't remember, but if I had to guess, it would have to be.
00:03:19.730 - 00:03:29.226, Speaker B: Bitcoin if it was three years ago or longer. I think most people's probably, like, really coinbase, like, for, at least for us in the US was it. And there was only three at the.
00:03:29.250 - 00:03:46.510, Speaker A: Time, so I remember, I remember. Oh, yeah, actually, I actually remember how I bought them. It was actually done through, like. Like, not through like an order book exchange, but just like a message board.
00:03:46.582 - 00:03:49.194, Speaker B: In Germany, my local bitcoins. Was that the one?
00:03:50.854 - 00:03:59.454, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe something like that. Someone just posted, you know, and then you send. Sent the money to their private bank account and they sent you their bitcoin.
00:03:59.614 - 00:04:27.094, Speaker B: Yeah, one of my friends did. My. One of my friends did the same thing. I was like, you did what? Okay, so I guess the next question, just to now that we got the. When you got interested in the space out of the way, like, when was. How did, like, when and how did you find out about Solana? Because, like, being so early and writing the first tutorial, you were here before a lot of people. So I guess, like, how did you find out about it?
00:04:28.274 - 00:05:13.284, Speaker A: I think I don't remember exactly when. I know that cirm hadn't launched yet, so I think it was about a month or two before serum launched. Yeah. Like I said, I wanted to explore the space, and I'm an engineer. I want to build things. And so I looked for. I mean, I looked for platforms to build on, and the obvious choice was obviously ethereum, but I wanted to build something that I could play around with, and I couldn't really do that on Ethereum because it still is so expensive.
00:05:13.284 - 00:06:12.044, Speaker A: So that just wasn't really an option for me. So I looked around and L2s also weren't a thing. They weren't live yet. Then there's only so many options then that are left that are legit. Obviously, the 2017 chains, they're still there, but I wanted to explore the new ones, and I just wanted to get started, basically just looked up which chains were there, and I looked for a chain that seemed to have a legit team and legit tech and something that was actually live and working, and Aslana was that. So that's sort of how I got started.
00:06:12.164 - 00:06:23.404, Speaker B: Cool. So what was the first thing you looked at when you found out about Solana? Was it the core innovation articles, or was it just going straight to the documentation? At the time, it was the white.
00:06:23.444 - 00:06:49.024, Speaker A: Paper and the articles, but the articles are not that detailed. It's only an introduction. And the white paper also isn't that detailed. But at the time, because I was relatively early, I could just. There weren't that many people in the discord.
00:06:49.784 - 00:06:52.604, Speaker B: How many? Just curious, how many time we're in there?
00:06:53.584 - 00:07:41.814, Speaker A: Oh, I'm not. I don't have a number. I just remember that there were a couple of regulars that were asking questions. One of them was, like, Daffy from Mango and Smith. But the point is, you could talk with the Solana team relatively easily in the dev support channel, like, and you'd get answers quickly. So we just chatted. And that's sort of how I, how I learned, and that's like, that's also how I got much of the knowledge to, to write the blog post and just, you know, like, the dogs, but at the time, the dogs are better now, but still lots to work on.
00:07:41.814 - 00:07:57.626, Speaker A: And at the, that time that they had end, there was just, like, talking with the, talking with the Solana team about the darks really, really helped.
00:07:57.730 - 00:08:37.850, Speaker B: Yes. So I know, like, I knew Daffy was in there. I knew for these other guys, everybody's listening to you, like, talk about the state of the documentation at the time. I'm sure there's a lot of people who have a lot of words and a lot of grievances from back in the day, whenever there's really, at that time, really only the documentation. But one of the other big things that I've, the feedback since I joined, which I found out about Solana and probably sometime in, like, August, September, October, something of last year. And everybody I've talked to really just talks about how the dedicated support was really the way that they made their way through navigating Solana. Just the discord.
00:08:37.850 - 00:08:49.386, Speaker B: It's still that way today. We actually have some more developer relations in there, outside of core engineering, but they kind of saved the day just to get some of those early movers like you, like, over the hump, I guess.
00:08:49.450 - 00:08:50.094, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:51.194 - 00:09:09.214, Speaker B: One thing I would really be interested to know is, like, so you're, you found out about Solana, you're in the discord, you're trying to play around, and then all of a sudden, you were like, I'm going to write this escrow tutorial based off of all this stuff. It was that kind of how it worked out. And like, what, what made you decide to do the escrow program in general?
00:09:10.394 - 00:09:46.050, Speaker A: It turned out to be like a little bit of a bigger project than I, than I thought in the beginning. So I think it took about one or two months to write, and I still updated it regularly, so that was one reason I thought it wouldn't be that large, so I could just write something rather quickly. But also, it's just an effective learning method. Right. I mean, if you want to learn something, explain it to someone else.
00:09:46.242 - 00:09:47.178, Speaker B: That's right.
00:09:47.226 - 00:10:07.894, Speaker A: That's a good way to learn. So that's kind of what I was thinking. And. Yeah, I think, like, that was, that was my, that was basically it, yeah, I didn't expect it to be like, what it became, to be honest.
00:10:08.314 - 00:10:46.044, Speaker B: It became a lot. It's actually still probably one of the most accessed tutorials that we have. Maybe for the smart contract side, there are some people just like you that kind of learn by doing and learn by teaching. So we're kind of escalating the lots of new content being built. We just kind of launched this thing called the Solana Cookbook, which is kind of lots of code snippets for typescript, the CLI and rust. We just did that two days ago, and there's already so many contributors that like, and a lot of these guys like, I want to try this, but I don't, I don't know how to do it. We're like, it doesn't matter.
00:10:46.044 - 00:11:11.220, Speaker B: This is where you learn. You learn by teaching. So I think we're super lucky to have people like you to exploring new tech, writing things for other people, because I don't, like you said, you had no idea in the beginning what this would turn into. I mean, it's probably in all reality that documents probably been accessed tens of thousands of times at this point. Definitely thousands.
00:11:11.412 - 00:11:39.246, Speaker A: Probably end of the, it's maxing out my Netlify personal plan. I have 100gb a month and it's hitting, it's very close to the limit now. If you know how big a website is and you have 100gb, then you know how many views you can sort of calculate how many views it gets each day.
00:11:39.430 - 00:12:10.776, Speaker B: That's actually incredible. I had no idea. I knew it was a lot, but, yeah. So again, like, I think a lot of people are going to thank you. Whenever I finally found out about the escrow program, which was when I, when I actually ended up reaching out to you, it was a little bit later, after I started, I somehow hadn't seen it, and I started sharing it with somebody who was like, I need to make some sort of escrow program. And then I shared the tutorial, and, like, this ecosystem telegram group I was in, and everybody just jumped in. They were like, that's, that's the Solana Bible.
00:12:10.776 - 00:12:39.096, Speaker B: And I was like, everybody knows. Yeah, we all know this, this, they were like, this is how we all got started. How all got started in Solana. The, the thought about, like, what would have happened if you hadn't written that? I think about this, like, there might have been a hand, like, a pretty decent number of people that started building, never made it to the discord. Your, your tutorial didn't exist and they just never ended up built. It could be somebody that's actually like a live protocol with billions or millions of dollars of tv. All right, we don't know.
00:12:39.096 - 00:12:56.414, Speaker B: I don't know the answer to that, but it's kind of cool to think about that. Like, you might have had that sort of. Well, you have, um, and a lot of ways, but, um. So what was, uh, what was the most painful part? Like, this is a question I have to ask. Like, did you know rust before you. Um. No.
00:12:56.414 - 00:13:25.774, Speaker B: You? No rust at all. So what was the most painful part of this? Because a lot of people, I always thought it was rust when I first started, come to find out for a lot of people, it's not rust and it's actually Solana. It's like understanding accounts, PDA's and CPI's. A lot of things that, like, especially coming from ETH, don't make sense because you can't compare the two because they're completely different. So just curious on your thoughts on that.
00:13:26.714 - 00:14:10.868, Speaker A: Right, right. So, so I knew c from, from university, so that that helped with Rust, but also not that much. But I do think it's true. Like, rust is not. I don't think Rusk is the difficult thing about Solana, mostly because most Solana programs just don't use a lot of advanced rust features. It's just setting values and probably the more complex. Anything with math is probably a little bit complicated.
00:14:10.868 - 00:15:06.314, Speaker A: But you don't have to really think about multi threading in a Solana program or anything like that. The routes you use for Solana programs is pretty simple. I would say that the programming model for Solana is the difficult part. And also thinking about program architecture and related things, that's a difficult part. And, yeah, specifically, it's a little bit far away. Now, when I remember that time like, I pretty much remember, like, a feeling of joy. It was a lot of fun.
00:15:06.314 - 00:15:13.114, Speaker A: Like, it's like, I did it, I made it.
00:15:14.374 - 00:15:14.750, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:14.782 - 00:15:48.934, Speaker A: It's like you're thrown into, like, a really difficult challenge, and doing that is. It's fun. You know, just even not just the process of it is fun, but, yeah, for sure. PDA's were a little bit tricky to wrap your head around, but, yeah, you just put in the work and over time, you'll understand.
00:15:49.314 - 00:16:25.454, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, it has to be rewarding. At the time when you created that escrow program, probably one of the first external people ever to do that with only probably a handful, like, ten to 20 people in the world that even knows what Solana is, let alone how Solana works, is pretty cool, I guess. Another one of the things that we hear a lot about, and honestly, it's kind of been solved. We'll talk about how that's been solved in a way which is like, serialization and deserialization. Most people that build on Solana still have no idea how to do it. There's never really been a.
00:16:25.454 - 00:16:55.854, Speaker B: Obviously, people use borscht, but there has been no guidance to say this is what you should use. A lot of people bring that up, but it's like, this is a feature, not a bug. Nobody wants to tell you, but this kind of leads us into the next thing, which is there is a framework out there that has very strong opinions on how this thing work. And it's called anchor. And I guess, are you using, number one, are you still developing on Solana? And number two, have you used Anker?
00:16:56.154 - 00:17:08.774, Speaker A: So, yes to both questions, but I'm not building any bigger programs right now. But I'm actually helping build anchor now.
00:17:10.514 - 00:17:14.654, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Kind of sides over there.
00:17:18.044 - 00:18:10.728, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think anchor is great, and it's important for this. I think it's really important for future developers and developers that are on Solana ready to. That we improve the framework. Yeah, I took a little bit of a break in 2021, but when I came back, Amani asked me whether I want to help just build stuff. And we sort of thought that it would be a good idea if I come help with anchor. So that's what I'm doing now, which wasn't really like my. It wasn't entirely my intention to work on it that much, but it's a lot of fun.
00:18:10.728 - 00:18:18.840, Speaker A: So I've just been working on it all the time and thinking about what else we can do to improve it.
00:18:18.952 - 00:18:26.712, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, people love anchor. There's actually anchor Maxis out there at this point in time. I've spoken to a few of them.
00:18:26.768 - 00:18:27.364, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:30.464 - 00:19:26.284, Speaker B: And, I mean, it's a strange thing and not really a strange thing, but I've had a lot of these conversations, like. Like, working at Solana Labs. One of the big things that. That I think about is, like, there's just so many things going on right now and different paths to be taken. Like, what's the right one? Like, where do we, like, like, where does labs and all these different people that are building out, like, which path should people be taking? Like, yes, I understand. Like, in order to scale and grow developers, you're going to need something like an anchor to be able to onboard people quickly, because it takes away all this having to add all these accounts to every single transaction. Actually, I'm not sure that anchor abstracts that portion away, but it does abstract a lot of the underlying work, like the serialization and a lot of these things.
00:19:26.284 - 00:19:57.568, Speaker B: You don't have to think about a lot of the hard stuff, which is great. Frameworks are great. But also on the other side of that, you still need these, like, base layer engineers that can understand what happens underneath so that they can actually come and help fix anchor. Because I'm assuming if you never did what you did, you wouldn't be very effective helping build anchor right now if you hadn't, like, kind of suffered through, like, the pitfalls of just building rust. SoLANA Native like, maybe I'm wrong, but.
00:19:57.616 - 00:21:05.064, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, this, like, this is something that I've been thinking about as well. And I do think that if your plan is to deploy, like, a protocol and you expect it to handle hundreds of millions of dollars, you should have people on your team that could write the same program in just regular Solana code. And if you can't do that, then you should probably not deploy right now, but go back and study it a little bit more. But that said, sure, it helps people. Raw Solana programming helps people understand Solana, but then they should move away. Like, eventually they. I can't tell you what you should do, but I do think it would be a good idea to move to anchor, but it depends on your specific use case.
00:21:05.064 - 00:21:55.094, Speaker A: There are cases when maybe, like, a raw Solana program is better, but for most programs, anchor will work fine, and it will take a lot of work. Like, it will do a lot of work for you, so you can focus on the things that really matter to your application. Right. Like, if you don't have to think about, like, there are different kind of exploits, right? Like, sure, right. You can like the exploits that are sort of Solana specific where you, you forget to check an owner of a program, so you forget to check the owner of an account. And that's something that's very Solana specific. And that thing anchor can prevent for you.
00:21:55.094 - 00:22:19.974, Speaker A: But what anchor can't prevent is more complex interactions with other protocols. And maybe there's something wrong with your tokenomics or just generally your, your sort of your actual idea that's independent of Solana, so it allows you to spend more time focusing on that, which I think is very good.
00:22:20.674 - 00:23:22.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess kind of the takeaway from that is that if you are managing tons and tons of money, your core engineering team should probably understand how all this stuff works. And I know that some of these other bigger protocols like Sabre and psyoptions, and they all started out, well, Solana native because anchor didn't exist. But over time starting to add more features and features using anchor, probably saving them lots of times. I've heard the term that anchor. Once you learn it, you can probably ten x your development speed or capacity. I mean, obviously that's kind of subjective, depends on who you are. But your recommendation would be like, if you're coming onto Solana, you're not building this big protocol and you want to start working and not worry about all these exploits and things, and you just want to build something really cool and a lot faster than normal, then just kind of jump onto anchor and get started.
00:23:22.870 - 00:23:33.310, Speaker B: And if you decide to become a big protocol, maybe think about finding somebody who actually understands rust and some of the base knowledge.
00:23:33.422 - 00:24:04.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is more or less true with any programming language or framework. If you want to be an okay or close to good engineer, just do the framework. But if you want to do great things and you want to know what to do when something goes wrong and you want to know how to debug that, and you can really only do that if you understand what the framework actually does for you.
00:24:04.442 - 00:24:52.658, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a good analogy for a lot of people who are probably watching this because you're on the back end side. I don't know if you do much of the web3 or the front end stuff, but you can make the analogy, maybe it's not one to one, but JavaScript. You don't necessarily want to try to go start building react applications unless you understand how JavaScript works, because when you get some errors and you don't understand some of the low level JavaScript stuff, you might have a really pain in the painful experience trying to figure out what is actually wrong. I mean, I'm sure react is probably intuitive enough now to kind of like help get you through that, but if you know JavaScript, you're probably going to get things resolved a lot quicker. And it's kind of the same thing, I think.
00:24:52.706 - 00:25:35.824, Speaker A: Right. Even if you just, you know, you cannot go deeper than that and say, like, you're going to have a better time overall if you know what the, what the actual computer is doing underneath. Right? Like, what lies below that. If you understand what the computer is actually doing for you, what is the stack, for example? That's not really necessary to get started with JavaScript or rust even. But if you want to really understand things more deeply and learn how to fix things when they go wrong, it's probably a good idea to also learn how a computer works.
00:25:36.444 - 00:26:35.750, Speaker B: Yeah. There's actually been people recently that like, I mean, you know, I spend a lot of time on Twitter kind of just like banging the drum about Solana, trying to get people to FOMO out of their web two jobs to come to web3, and there's people that have zero development experience that will reach out. They're like, how do I start developing on Solana? Like, if I have no development experience? Like almost like, not even try to jump from nothing to react, they're trying to jump from nothing to Solana. And my response is like, honestly, if you don't learn some architectural basics and just building programs or like, learn a JavaScript or a python, you almost have a 0% chance of success rate of building something on Solana. And if you are successful, it's probably not going to be very safe. So it's kind of irresponsible to tell somebody to go from zero to Solana and skipping everything in between. Like I said, I don't think that it's, you're gonna have to be some sort of gigabrain to ever even make that leap.
00:26:35.750 - 00:26:38.990, Speaker B: But it's probably possible in some world.
00:26:39.062 - 00:27:47.714, Speaker A: But, yeah, like, if I were to start from zero, yeah, I don't think I would try to, like, have my, like, launch my own protocol one month into my learning journey. I don't think that that's a very good idea. But, like, if I'm, if I'm really interested in the space, then I can still start doing work, I can still contribute from very early on. Not everyone needs to. You don't have to launch your own protocol to start learning and to start contributing. There's a ton of work to do on, on the open source projects in Solana. Or maybe you can have an internship somewhere where you don't work on the core code, the actual program, but you can get familiar, you can get acquainted with the industry and the people.
00:27:47.714 - 00:28:03.178, Speaker A: That way you can build up the knowledge and already be in the ecosystem and without touching critical code. And over time, you'll be able to do that as well.
00:28:03.266 - 00:28:37.210, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean, to that point, the Solana, it's not even just Solana. There's other blockchains as well. But I'm more familiar with the Solana community, and it's super welcoming, especially the developer community. And if you want to get involved and you found and you, and you're a developer and you find a protocol that you really, like, go into their discord, start asking questions, then start helping people, then start thinking about maybe, like, going and fixing a syntax issue and a GitHub repo. It doesn't matter. It can be the tiniest thing in the world.
00:28:37.210 - 00:29:02.526, Speaker B: Just keep doing that next time a little bit stronger. But when people reach out to me from web two to web3, they're like, hey, I want a job. How do I get into this space? I'm like, get involved, right? Make a tool that everybody wants to use. Give to the community. Go contribute to a repo. Like, now my, now my go to is going to be like, go write a recipe in the Solana cookbook and I'll help you out here. I'm kind of just joking here.
00:29:02.526 - 00:29:15.716, Speaker B: But, like, anyways, it's just like, the people that in this space, it's different. They're not looking on LinkedIn. They are looking for people that just go out and just get shit done. And that's what everybody's doing. And it's kind of incredible.
00:29:15.830 - 00:30:02.434, Speaker A: Right? And also, if you really want to do this, then of course, and you start from zero. Of course you can't take an entire degree in one or three months, but there's so much you can learn from online and just so many, so many courses that you can just take for free, and you can basically just learn, like, really all the time in your first, I don't know, six months. Like, you're, you're going to be fine to at least, you know, get a, get a job somewhere, I think in crypto.
00:30:03.054 - 00:30:24.918, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Like, it's really just about passion and motivation and just persistence, and you just keep going at it. If you really want it, you're going to eventually get it. And I think, like, that's the kind of, like, the point that I keep trying to make to people, like, everybody working in this space, it didn't happen by chance. They weren't just lucky. It's because, like, they were like, I want that job. I want to get in here.
00:30:24.918 - 00:30:49.030, Speaker B: And they did it. I get, like, messages that make me feel really good about, like, what I do is I'll get messages. I've gotten a couple from at least one from Phantom and some other places. They'll get a message down the line, like, a month later. It's like, thank you so much. I just got hired at Phantom, and I was like, I've talked to thousands of people. Like, like, when, when was this conversation? And then I would look back, and I'm like, oh, my God, man.
00:30:49.030 - 00:31:22.338, Speaker B: I'm so happy for you. And it's like, it's great because those people took the advice. I know that they listened to what I said, took the advice, just hammered it down, started contributing, and then the next thing you know, like, they're, they're working on, like, in my opinion, the greatest ux wallet there is. But, like, that, it's pretty good. So, yeah, the, it's been, it's been a wild experience for a lot of people. Things are not slowing down anytime soon. We just had 530 some people in our latest hackathon.
00:31:22.338 - 00:31:57.068, Speaker B: If the next one's any more than that, like, I'm not, I don't even know what I'm gonna do with myself doing devolations. But, like, as our content gets better and things get a lot, like, compared to two hackathons ago when there was not, like, hardly anything, basically Paul X and then a couple resources now to, like, having a lot more community content, people were asking less questions in discord. Anchor is actually taking a lot of people out of the Solana discord and plucking them into there, which has been a nice relief. Thank you. Thank you, Armani. That's, that's been beautiful. But then there's just a lot more people.
00:31:57.068 - 00:32:54.230, Speaker B: The more people that you help get over those big humps of Solana, the more people that they help out, and then that just kind of just keeps growing. And, like, the developer, I can't even put a number on it, but, like, the slanted developer community has been, like, super. It's huge. And I wanted to, I guess the final question that I wanted to ask you is probably, like, I wanted to do this, this show specifically to just talk about people's experiences, where they came from, where they are, how they got there, just so that people out there watching can, like, get some inspiration and motivation on, like, to make the jump. There's a lot of people that are literally right there on that cliff of Web two just like every day being like, I got to do it, I got to do it. And then they don't do it. So, like, hopefully just talk, like, talking to people like you, maybe Armani wink wink at some point in time and that they'll just make that jump.
00:32:54.230 - 00:33:22.316, Speaker B: So you've already did a lot of work with the escrow tutorial. Hopefully this interview also has a similar impact. I guess, that. Do you have any, like, words of advice for Solana devs that are, that are just getting started or just like, just something like you made the jump into, into the space. You were in university, you were like, I'm kind of bored with, like, this stuff. This thing looks cool. Any words of advice to some younger developers out there?
00:33:22.460 - 00:34:13.720, Speaker A: Like, the first and most obvious one is to just get started. You don't have to go full time on this immediately. You can just get started with something so you can see whether it works for you. But get started. I think once you do that, I'm not sure if I have really general advice for people. It really depends on the person. But once you get started, contribute to the ecosystem and talk to people, to anyone, to me, my DM's are open.
00:34:13.720 - 00:34:49.854, Speaker A: Twitter and discord and many others you can talk to as well if you need specific advice that's more tailored to your background. But yeah, in general, the way I think about it is the way I think about crypto in general is that it's still quite early and we need a lot of experiments and we need experiments on all layers of the stack. Layer one, L2, maybe the DAO.
00:34:49.894 - 00:34:52.674, Speaker B: Layer above that, maybe design and ux.
00:34:53.894 - 00:36:06.942, Speaker A: Yeah, like everything we need to do those experiments. So if you have crazy ideas, now might be a good time to try and explore them because there's lots of money in crypto right now. You can probably get funding and support from people because crypto is very welcoming and experiments are really good for the space to push it forward because who knows where we will be in five years. I don't even just thinking about that, I have no idea. But the way we go, we push this thing forward is to try a lot of different things. And again, I'm not even saying you should necessarily go to Solana, but you should at least if you want to push the space forward, join an experiment that you think pushes the space forward. And that will already be very good for all of us and hopefully yourself as well.
00:36:06.942 - 00:36:50.434, Speaker A: Solana specific is pretty much the same advice. Get started, talk to people, build programs as soon as possible to learn how it all works. And then again, if you think there's gaps in documentation, write stuff or make videos or something like that, at least that has helped me understand the programming model much better, and it also helps others. So that's great, really. Most of it is just putting in the work every day and grinding.
00:36:51.614 - 00:36:55.470, Speaker B: You mean eating glass and chewing glass and all that fun stuff?
00:36:55.542 - 00:36:59.654, Speaker A: Yeah, pretty much, yeah. But, you know, get, get started.
00:37:00.034 - 00:37:23.754, Speaker B: Yeah. I think you touched on something that I didn't really touch on, which is actually huge. And like, part of my job in general is just to help grow the community. And the way that I do that is by, like, opening up my DM's to everybody. I'll literally talk to anybody when you're interested in this space. Like my, I probably get about, probably 80 to 100 every day. I wake up in the morning, I go through all of them, filter out the NFT drop.
00:37:23.754 - 00:37:44.778, Speaker B: Every day I filter out the NFT drop requests that I usually like. Take about 30% of those. But anyways, this community is welcoming. If you have a question, don't be scared. Reach out to somebody. Follow a couple accounts that seem pretty active. I actually created a list on Twitter called Solana developers.
00:37:44.778 - 00:38:14.504, Speaker B: All you have to do is follow that list and all the alpha is right there for you. Start dming every single one of those people, including myself. Yeah, the community portion is huge. It's probably one of the greatest superpowers that Solana actually has right now, getting involved. Like you said, YouTube videos, this NFT space has blown up. There's people that aren't devs, they're starting podcasts, they're just participating. And it's with this whole new world, we're getting the chance to reinvent.
00:38:14.504 - 00:38:58.122, Speaker B: In my personal view, there's probably some disagreement out there. We're getting to reinvent the Internet, uh, in a way. And so you're talking about these experiments, like, get out there and experiment and like, maybe you come up with something that nobody else has thought about doing on blockchain yet, and it could just, like, it could change your life. Not, I'm not talking about just financially. Like, you could just go into this trajectory of where, like, this is where you were kind of meant to be the entire time. And, and I've seen a lot of people say that they're like, we're unhappy until they actually got into web3, where we all work a lot, but we love it. But anyways, Paul, like, thanks so much for joining.
00:38:58.122 - 00:39:15.780, Speaker B: I know, I know you're, now that you're a full time anchor, Maxi, like, I'm surprised you had time to mute only here. Just kidding. But, yeah, thanks for joining. I really appreciate it. Thanks for the escrow tutorial. Thanks for building on anchor and continuing that. Just generally.
00:39:15.780 - 00:39:23.700, Speaker B: Thanks for everything, and thanks to everybody for watching. So we'll just check everybody later. Bye.
00:39:23.772 - 00:39:24.444, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
