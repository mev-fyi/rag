00:00:04.400 - 00:00:39.025, Speaker A: All right, Excited to be here. Hi, Breakpoint. I'm Mike Kahl. I'm the CEO of Doral Labs and we're building the Pith Network. And today we're going to talk a little bit about a new product update. The mission of the Pith Network is to supercharge defi infrastructure so that apps can compete with dapps. It does this across three cost, speed and trust by relentlessly removing inefficiencies so that better application types are possible.
00:00:39.025 - 00:01:18.545, Speaker A: I'm incredibly proud of where the network has gotten to at this point. So far, 400 applications have been built using PIF. Over $100 billion in transaction volume in July alone. $700 billion in transaction volume of all time, a number that's up tenfold year over year. But we got to keep things in perspective. Defi is still relatively small compared to CEFI. Today we're introducing pith price feeds.
00:01:18.545 - 00:02:24.645, Speaker A: V3. V1 offered synchronized Oracle updates in the fastest blockchain so that new application types were possible. This was a giant leap forward, and we saw the evolution of what was possible on chain. V2 brought the fastest Oracle updates to all chains at Solana speeds, available to over 75 different blockchains. V3, we're introducing Oracle Integrity Staking price feeds with protection. What if application developers didn't need to worry about inaccurate data? Oracle Integrity Staking for the first time will cover all price feeds on all chains, from any sort of misprice based on the staking from publishers to the quality of their data. But what's more is that this is open for anybody participating to stake to a publisher and earn up to 10% yields.
00:02:27.865 - 00:02:51.025, Speaker B: In the world of defi, the strength of the ecosystem depends on one foundation. Truth. Who stands guard over that truth? Pith does. Through Oracle Integrity Staking, pith keeps data pure and unbroken. How can I be a part of this? Stake your pith to become part of the movement. The Guardians of Defi are rewarded for their vigilance.
00:02:53.925 - 00:03:01.885, Speaker A: All right, it's live today. Go to the website. Oracle wrists are a thing of the past. Thanks, guys.
