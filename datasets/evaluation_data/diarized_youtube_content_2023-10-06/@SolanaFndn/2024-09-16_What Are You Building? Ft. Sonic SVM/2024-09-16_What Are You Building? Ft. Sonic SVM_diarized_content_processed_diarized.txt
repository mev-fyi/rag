00:00:00.360 - 00:00:26.763, Speaker A: Jonas, what are you building? I am building a gaming rollup called Sonic. It's a runtime environment we're provisioning for different games. We'll be baking in a few primitives types for building ECS framework oriented gaming programs. We're also using zero knowledge proofs for the state aggregation. We're also building it on top of a framework called HyperGrid. And what HyperGrid allows us to do is to spin up different gaming roll ups. It doesn't only have to be gaming, it could be different environments as well.
00:00:26.763 - 00:00:33.235, Speaker A: Different verticals as well. But Sonic represents the first type of grid or runtime that is using hyper grading.
