00:00:08.800 - 00:00:32.644, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Good afternoon. Welcome to Estufafria, our growth stage. It symbolizes the vibrant expansion of the Solana ecosystem. And so we're absolutely excited to celebrate the blood, sweat and tears of our development developers building on Solana. So, without further ado, I'd like to welcome Tristan from Zeta.
00:00:52.564 - 00:01:36.892, Speaker B: Cool. Is the screenshot working? All right, awesome. Thanks, everyone, for coming here. If I haven't met you already, my name is Tristan and I'm a core contributor at Zeta Markets. Zeta is a best in class defi derivatives platform and offers both futures and options trading. The goal of Zeta is to bring the best of CFI to the world of defi. In particular, we're trying to bring the speed and capital efficiency that you love in some of these platforms to the blockchain.
00:01:36.892 - 00:02:20.868, Speaker B: And essentially, we're trying to fulfill Anatolia's vision of bringing Nasdaq on chain. So, to jump into the demo, which is what you're all here for today, here is the Zeta platform. As you can see, first off, we're basically going to go and connect our wallet. You can see we support a bunch of wallets, your usual ones, and recently integrated some great ones, like slope over here for mobile wallets. So let's jump in and connect our wallet. So here you can see we've actually got a nice little onboarding flow to walk you through the product and how to get started, airdrop ourselves a bit of USDC, which should come through in just a second. So we've got our 10,000 devnet USDC.
00:02:20.868 - 00:03:01.470, Speaker B: We deposit it into our margin account, which is approved through our phantom wallet here, and nice little modal. So now we can get started on the zeta platform and actually start trading. So to basically show you what we have here, we're trying to build this kind of CFI options and futures exchange, something that I guess is parallels, like an FTX or Darabit. We start off with our Devnet balance here of 10,000 USDC. And you can see the UI here. We basically have our chart, which is using the underlying pith Oracle. So we actually open sourced, I guess, the first price chart for pith underlying prices.
00:03:01.470 - 00:03:36.508, Speaker B: And here you can see we have our strike panel, all the different strikes, your bid, your asks, and your break evens, which is really cool. And you're able to trade both your calls and put options. You can see here in the strike panel, we show the current price of where spot currently is. So Solana's at a nice dollar 244, and we can see all our out of the money strikes here. And our in the money calls here. So basically these strikes are auto generated as well. Every time the market goes and expires, we take the spot spot price and we can dynamically generate.
00:03:36.508 - 00:04:07.430, Speaker B: And so this will basically go on in perpetuity in this contract, which is really cool. We've also got multiple expiries, as you'd be familiar with, with options and we can seamlessly change between them, which is great. Yeah. And we can. We see ourselves as kind of the uniswap for options. We can list a bunch of long tail like alt assets for options and we can basically scale to any number of strikes and expiries as we please. So now let's actually go through the trading flow.
00:04:07.430 - 00:04:25.110, Speaker B: This is the exciting bit. We're going to go through what it's like to be an end user on the Zeta platform. So we're going to go here, we're going to select a call. We're on the 9 November expiry. We're going to get a kind of deep out of the money call here. Over 1 second. Sorry.
00:04:25.110 - 00:04:42.754, Speaker B: Here we select the strike here. You can see we've basically got all the parameters here. It gives you a little memo here as well. On this date, I think Sol will be above $280. So that's essentially what an option is doing. And it kind of allows you to speculate there. So we've got the buy and the sell.
00:04:42.754 - 00:05:08.734, Speaker B: Let's go and sell an option. So we're selling a call option here. You can see the order book. So we've got all our bids and our asks on the order book. So to go and see sell an option, let's pick this one on the order book. It kind of autofills the price based on this level of the order book. And we can go and use this scroller to select how many options we want to put on, or we can numerically go and chuck in 100 here.
00:05:08.734 - 00:05:38.024, Speaker B: So the really cool thing I want to highlight here is we are selling 100 call options here on Solana. If you were to do this on a fully collateralized platform, you'd actually be paying what the spot price is. So roughly 250, and we're selling 100 of them. So if you do the math, that ends up coming up to $25,000 that you'd have to post in collateral. However, since we're an under collateralized platform, we can actually do it at a fraction of that. And you can see that the initial margin we need to put up is only 2500. So it's actually 10% of the full collateral that you need to post.
00:05:38.024 - 00:06:02.540, Speaker B: And this makes it really efficient for any kind of market participants, market makers. You can do a lot with that kind of money. You don't have to post up a ton. Let's go through here, and let's actually sell this call option. You can see the little phantom pop up here goes and sells it, and you can see gets executed straight away. We get a little bit of a trade notification there telling us that we got filled on the orderbook. And I guess the order book to preface is actually built on top of serum.
00:06:02.540 - 00:06:22.748, Speaker B: So we're executing all these contracts through the serum settlement layer here. We have our position, and you can see it here. So we're short 100 Solana calls for the 280 strike. And you can see your p and l and a bunch of other parameters there. So that's basically, in a nutshell, how you would trade on our platform. It's as easy as that. And you've suddenly put on an options position.
00:06:22.748 - 00:06:52.718, Speaker B: So that's really exciting. You've also got all your kind of different account metrics here, so that's really cool. We've got options, which is incredible. We're one of the first to bring options to the Solana blockchain, and we would say we're like a best in class platform here, bringing under collateralized super fast options. Not only that, but we also just released last night to the public futures trading. So we're actually the first dated futures exchange as well on Solana, which we think is also really exciting. We're able to ship that out in record time, which is super cool.
00:06:52.718 - 00:07:29.494, Speaker B: You can see we have for our two expiries, our futures listed, our 9th and 10 November ones. And once again, it's a similar trading flow. You can go and basically put on the different size that you want. It will show your liquidation price and a bunch of other things. And I can go ahead and buy or sell a future here, and that will go get executed and eventually show up there. So that all looks really simple and really easy to trade, but there's a lot of science and a lot of interesting stuff going on, going on under the hood. So under the hood, one of our magic mechanisms, I guess, we are using the CRM order book, but we're also composing that with what we call our options market maker, or OMM, as you'll see in our documentation.
00:07:29.494 - 00:08:16.228, Speaker B: This is basically a framework to price all the different options that are out there on the Zeta platform. And we use basically best in class from tradfi, like black Scholes pricing for all these options to give really accurate, fast updating prices that move with the pith Oracle. And so, yeah, we basically think that our platform is almost like the Uniswap for volatility. It basically lets you price volatility and find the fair value there. And given that we know the theoretical prices for all these options, or we have an opinion there, we can quote two sided. And that's why you can see we have quotes across all these different markets. So on some other platforms, you might look at them and they might have no liquidity on all their markets.
00:08:16.228 - 00:08:43.282, Speaker B: We actually, for just Solana, we have two strikes. Eleven expiries, calls and puts ends up being 46 markets. All of them are basically quoted by this market maker. And so you can enter into any position, you're always going to find a counterparty to trade against. The other thing is, we are building on Solana 400 millisecond block times means we can update very quickly. We use pith under the hood as our price oracle. So we're really reactive in terms of some of the pricing that we have.
00:08:43.282 - 00:09:19.442, Speaker B: This also lets us do liquidations in real time, which is really exciting. And that's what basically powers the under collateralization in our platform. We use future style margining. Basically, people can go leveraged on that. And the more leveraged you are, the quicker you get liquidated. And we can do that because it's so fast on Solana, I guess, to wrap up on that, we're currently on Devnet, which is really exciting, and you can go out there and play a little bit on the platform and get a sense for what we're building. The project in general, would love feedback, jump in the discord, post any kind of product feedback.
00:09:19.442 - 00:09:34.454, Speaker B: We'd love to hear from you. Also, if anyone's building composable projects, vaults or automated strategies, also, people we'd really love to talk to, market makers and anyone trying to, I guess, hedge out their portfolio using options. Cool.
00:09:40.854 - 00:09:56.574, Speaker A: Tristan, thank you so much. You were participating in the hackathon and you received our grand prize. I was just wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about your story of how you started the project, and if you have any advice for future hackathon participants.
00:09:56.654 - 00:10:28.518, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So it was just a bunch of like minded individuals who knew one another, and we wanted to build something really instrumental and interesting in the space. And the Solana hackathon was obviously an incredible way to get kickstarted. It basically started as a few guys coming together and working out of an apartment, building a really simple platform, which is now scaled. And it's a huge community, decentralized across the world. 20,000 people in the discord who are all pitching in and giving their different inputs and trying to build out the best platform there is.
00:10:28.686 - 00:10:31.510, Speaker A: Do you have any advice for future hackathon participants?
00:10:31.622 - 00:10:53.198, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think a lot of people are on the fence whether they should go full time into blockchain and into development. And there's a bit of a learning curve, admittedly, but the payoff is incredible. Once you go over that little learning curve, I think the rewards are kind of endless. I think the community are awesome. You learn so much about distributed systems and smart contract programming, and I think there's a really vibrant community around Solana. That's just amazing.
00:10:53.286 - 00:11:04.262, Speaker A: No, it's been amazing to see just so many projects being submitted and the hackathons, and we've really seen, I think, true organic growth through it. Thank you so much for your presentation.
00:11:04.358 - 00:11:04.950, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:11:05.022 - 00:11:05.566, Speaker A: Love it.
00:11:05.630 - 00:11:06.328, Speaker B: Not at all.
00:11:06.446 - 00:11:07.388, Speaker A: See you on main net.
00:11:07.476 - 00:11:09.664, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Thank you, Ron.
00:11:14.804 - 00:11:19.904, Speaker A: We'd like to invite our next speaker, Vito from all art.
00:11:24.164 - 00:11:51.196, Speaker C: Hi. Yeah, I'll just have to do this. Okay. I hope it. It's running now. The power is. No, actually turned off.
00:11:51.196 - 00:12:20.964, Speaker C: So, yeah, this is gonna take a while, probably the battery died. So, yeah, I have to do it on the power. But actually, I would like to take this opportunity while the laptop is powering up to tell you a bit about what we are actually doing. As you can probably see, I'm wearing the hoodie, which is Solsea hoodie. Right. And some of you might know what the salsie is. It's the first truly open marketplace, NFT marketplace on Solana blockchain.
00:12:20.964 - 00:12:59.260, Speaker C: And there are war stories about Solsi, how it started, where it is now. But what I want to do now on the stage is actually do something special. And so behind Solsee is olart. Okay. And this is the first time that you are seeing our new visual identity. And I'll tell you more about what is actually ol art. Ol art protocol is the infrastructure layer that we are creating on Solana blockchain to enable next level of NFT, creating, NFT, managing NFT, organizing, trading.
00:12:59.260 - 00:14:04.776, Speaker C: Everything that has to do with nfTs. All our protocol, hopefully, is building it is doing so together with Metaplex guys. We are using the metaplex protocol also together with them, and we want to extend the protocol for different verticals in the whole ecosystem. So what we have concluded is that actually what is happening with the NFTs is a very strange situation is that NFTs were created by programmers and they were created to handle transfer of the digital ownership. But the problem with the digital item that is represented as an NFT is that it does not have all the metadata, all the ontologies, all the concepts of different verticals, different verticals in business, different verticals in art, in culture, in many different areas of life. So if we want to change the world using nfts, we need to tackle all these different industries. We need to see what they need from the NFTs, which is not only hash in the blockchain.
00:14:04.776 - 00:15:29.264, Speaker C: So I'll show you a couple of interesting things. Now, actually, I have no idea how much time do I have? There is a slight problem, because when the computer turned off, all the pages turned off, it's plugged in. So until the image appears, I also want to say that we are the only marketplace on Solana for the NFTs that is truly open, which means that you can come, you can mint an NFT, and you can list it for sales. And this has been a real struggle in the last two months, since we've been alive, because, as you know, the name of the game is like a create a fake and then sell a fake. And then it all started with also creating a lot of collections that you have probably seen in the last couple of months. And a collection of the collection also requested verification. And then you come to a point to understand, like, what an NFT verification actually means.
00:15:29.264 - 00:16:29.366, Speaker C: Like, who is the creator? What creator does he has the right to publish a collection like that? Where are the artist rights? Who owns the art that he is displaying? And these are all very important elements of this future play of NFTs that actually no one is currently taking care of. Because talking to an artist that is minting an NFT and verifying it doesn't mean that we just need to identify him. We need to identify his work. We need to know whether this work came from him. Is it an original work or is it a derivative work? And there's a whole bunch of problems that are associated with actually managing the NFT sector properly. So what I want to show you here is how Solsi is actually managing an Ola protocol, are managing these things. So when you go to Salsi and when you want to create an NFT, it's as simple as this.
00:16:29.366 - 00:17:21.872, Speaker C: You just go to create page, and then you upload things, upload images, upload files, put a title, put a description. But here is an interesting thing. This is what I want to emphasize. All art is the first protocol, what we know in the world, to include a license, right, embedded inside of the NFT. That means that the license exists on chain and they're linked with the NFT itself. And that means that when a buyer and a seller make a deal, right, a buyer buys an NFT, he actually knows what rights he owns. And if you pay a close attention to what is happening in the NFT sector, very small number of projects are actually transferring any rights or even know what rights mean, what copyright is, what the intellectual property is.
00:17:21.872 - 00:18:20.854, Speaker C: They simply don't know these things. So you, when you buy an NFT, you actually don't know what you are allowed to do with this. And this is a big major problem that needs to be solved if we want to onboard the traditional art market, if you want to onboard museums, if you want to onboard music industry, if you want to onboard movie industry. All these verticals have their own license rights, license agreements, transferring off intellectual property and things like that. So anyway, when you are minting an NFT, you're basically selecting a license like a private use, personal use, public use, public display, reproduction, commercial exploitation. But this is just the start of how structuring the licenses inside of the NFTs should look like. And all our protocol is here to deliver these new standards in the NFTs for the future of not only the art market and the NFT market, but also other NFT verticals.
00:18:20.854 - 00:19:05.058, Speaker C: So what I want to show you next, of course, come to the Solsi and mint some nfts, but want to show you next, is this. So this is a virtual exhibition that we did for a special collection that we are very fond of. It's called God's exhibition. So all art was actually derived from VR Olart, which is our platform for virtual reality galleries, museums and exhibitions. And it runs in a browser, but it also runs on a VR headset. And we have also our own avatars inside virtual reality. So when you jump into VR, you can actually see your hands, you can meet other people as avatars inside.
00:19:05.058 - 00:20:03.214, Speaker C: It's really crazy, but here how the gallery actually looks like when you're browsing through it. So we have the engine for creating these galleries, for editing the exhibitions, publishing exhibitions, both in VR and on the web. And you can see that great care has been taken for these exhibitions to look photorealistic. And this is what we've seen in the last, let's say, three years while we were developing Vrlart. Is that photo realism and making these environments look real is what matters when people enter VR when people go into virtual reality, if the environment is photo realistically rendered, then they take care, they look at the art. And this is what we have seen from all the users that were getting into the virtual reality. So not only that you can see this is a gods exhibition.
00:20:03.214 - 00:20:53.690, Speaker C: But I want to also show you some other exhibitions that we've done with VRL art. And for example, this is a digital art fair that was recently released in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, they had a real art fair and then we built them the digital art fair. It featured, I think, more than 100 NFT artists, from the names like Beeple and puck to some of the less known artists. And all of that was done also in virtual reality and on the web. And you can see that when you go to Vrlart website. But what I want to tell you here is that the fairs of the future, galleries of the future, museums of the future, will all exist in what we call today metaverses.
00:20:53.690 - 00:21:48.476, Speaker C: You know, there's a person called Mark Zuckerberg that took this name, and we don't like it, but it is what it is. So anyway, the metaverses of the future will actually function as places where nfts are stored, where nfts are displayed, where nfts are used. And this is the most important thing that we should all realize is the NFT is a bearer of the digital form and value that will be our, let's say, next level of presence in the digital world. You will own your avatar, you will change your avatar, you will own your sneakers, you will own your shirts as a digital form. And then you will have your own homes, you will have your own galleries. You will be able to put on display the collections that you made as nfts. But I can tell you that this is just the beginning.
00:21:48.476 - 00:22:34.224, Speaker C: When museums start digitizing their collections, putting them in virtual reality, this is where the real fun starts. So we, in all our protocol, understand the need of the community, the need of the whole world to actually make this transformation. And this is what we are building, these new standards for different verticals, making them all fit together. And while doing this, we will be pushing not only Solsi as an open marketplace, but also Vrlart and many other products that we are developing that will plug in to the protocol, together with, of course, the Metaplex foundation, that is, let's say, the core infrastructure layer that is needed. So thank you for your time and. Yeah.
00:22:43.704 - 00:22:47.248, Speaker A: Hey, Vito. Oh my God, you guys have been building so much.
00:22:47.336 - 00:22:50.044, Speaker C: Well, they're the guys.
00:22:51.184 - 00:23:06.320, Speaker A: Well, I mean, this is curious because nfts are going to be huge, and it seems like they are starting to really have a lot more utility. And I was interested in learning more about the unity Solana wallet that you guys were working on.
00:23:06.392 - 00:23:55.768, Speaker C: Could you tell us more about that? Well, actually, the guy there, he's called Vuc, and he will be giving a workshop on Wednesday on Unity Solana Wallet, then explain how to use it. We also now have NFT implementation in the unity Solana wallet. So we will release that during the conference. And what is interesting here is that unity is one of the core game engines on the market, right? So Vrlart was built in unity, and we see that if there is an easy plugin for unity to use, Solana blockchain and NFTs on Solana blockchain, actually, this will give kind of a boost for the whole industry of games apps that are delivered in unity to actually be the cornerstone of implementation of gaming verticals and maybe some other marketing verticals, apps in marketing that will spark the next revolution in VR, AR, things like that.
00:23:55.896 - 00:24:17.504, Speaker A: No, I truly agree, especially because I think that with our recent announcement of the $100 million lightspeed FTX and Solana fund for gaming, I truly do think that, like, a lot of us at Solana Labs really think that gaming is kind of going to be the next level. Like, it's going to be the next level of, like, nfts and just like, mass user adoption.
00:24:17.544 - 00:24:32.048, Speaker C: You know why? The thing is that when you talk to children, right? I mean, children, like adolescents playing. Playing games, like when they're, I don't know, 13 years old, 14 years old, 15 years old, they want to play to earn, right?
00:24:32.096 - 00:24:32.376, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:32.440 - 00:25:06.112, Speaker C: So this is what they want. Because the current state is that the only way that they can get to the audience, or let's say, earn some money is by making it a YouTube channel for them, being a youtuber. And that is not for every child because they cannot go on camera. They don't have the charisma. It's not for them. But they are looking at these youtubers and thinking, oh, my God, if I could earn some money on it. But if the nfts and cryptocurrencies and play to earn models come into, you know, like, we will probably be eating the food that provided the kid and not ourselves.
00:25:06.112 - 00:25:20.680, Speaker C: I mean, this is going to be crazy future. But yeah, I see a lot of potential in play to earn, but we need to kind of think where this is actually going because it's not an easy thing to kind of rotate everything around value and money.
00:25:20.792 - 00:25:21.656, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:25:21.680 - 00:25:36.630, Speaker C: And currently it is, I mean, in the NFT sector, it's a, I mean, complete cash grab. And it's all about, you know, making money on nfts. So we need to move this into the arts space. We need to move these things into the real culture.
00:25:36.702 - 00:25:36.886, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:36.910 - 00:25:45.662, Speaker A: And to more experience, you know, like giving people the experience of, like, NFts as well. Like with VR, AlL art. Like, it's absolutely amazing. Kind of like what you guys have built.
00:25:45.718 - 00:25:52.086, Speaker C: Yeah, but you have to try it in VR. I'm serious. I'm serious. You have to meet in VR. Thank you very much.
00:25:52.110 - 00:25:54.288, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much for your presentation today.
00:25:54.336 - 00:25:55.044, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:25:56.264 - 00:26:26.878, Speaker A: That was a veto from all art. That was a veto from all art. And we're now really happy to announce our next speaker, Matt from Valhalla. And Valhalla is another NFT marketplace. And we're seeing just a ton of growth in the NFT area on Solana today with like 2.2 million NFTs minted, like, in the last three months, which is absolutely insane. But Matt, take the stage.
00:26:26.966 - 00:26:32.614, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. All right, hey, everybody.
00:26:32.654 - 00:27:12.768, Speaker D: Nice to be here. My name is Matthew. I'm starting Valhalla IO with my co founder. And Valhalla is an NFT protocol based on Solana. And the base layer is a NFT marketplace. And we're really focusing on UI UX to really bridge the non crypto to help bring non crypto users over to the NFT space. And I think, you know, what I think this space really needs right now and what we're really focusing on is a heavy focus on UI Ux because at the end of the day, like non crypto users are, you know, they're not going to spend time, you know, setting up wallets, doing all that stuff that's, that's a little bit more complex.
00:27:12.768 - 00:28:00.554, Speaker D: So we're really trying to bridge the non crypto user over to the NFT space. And beyond that, once we have perfected the simplicity of an NFT marketplace that is very usable, we want to expand on that by integrating defi tools to add instant liquidity and helping users extract more liquidity from their nfts. It's been a pretty exciting process so far. We just started building a little over a month ago and entered the hackathon with not too much time, but it was very fun. And we have something that I want to show, which is I would call pre pre alpha. And, yeah, so basically this is what we have so far. So you can go connect your phantom wallet explore.
00:28:00.554 - 00:28:59.656, Speaker D: You can set your profile, you can verify by Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and eventually want to allow users to automatically import content very easily and seamlessly. Again, everything is tailored to the non crypto users so they can come in and access these tools that everybody else is enjoying right now. We also have minting functionality layered on top of metaplex. So you can come in here, mint your NFT, and it will then appear in your created collections. Down here, you can select your NFT and then list it, for instance, sale or an auction. And what isn't really displayed visually here, which I would like to talk about a little bit more, is how the Valhalla token will play into the ecosystem. So we're aiming to have this be the first community run Dao governed NFT marketplace on Solana.
00:28:59.656 - 00:30:00.634, Speaker D: So what we're going to be focusing on is having the bulk of the fees generated from the protocol flow to the Valhalla treasury, and then users of Valhalla, people who participate in the ecosystem, will be eligible to earn those rewards. So that's the Vision behind Valhalla. And then we also really want to incorporate cross Chain. We think eventually this is going to be a very cross Chain ecosystem, and the usability of Solana is just unbelievable. You know, we really think that we're going to see a lot of NFT activity from other chains move over to Solana, and so we want to be able to help facilitate that as much as possible. And eventually, a lot of, I've spoken with a lot of creators from the crypto world and the non Crypto world, and the bulk of them are pretty chain agnostic. They care about their art and not much else about the crypto space.
00:30:00.634 - 00:30:33.354, Speaker D: So we really want to help make that process a lot easier for the artist. And so I think the natural evolution of that is going cross chain. But in terms of the layer that we want to be based on and have everything run off, it's a no brainer for that to be Solana. So, yeah, this is Valhalla started recently, and it's been extremely fun building it, and the Solana community is very badass, and we're happy to be involved in the Solana community. And, yeah, that's pretty much it.
00:30:35.014 - 00:30:53.074, Speaker A: Thanks. Hey, Matt.
00:30:53.114 - 00:30:53.610, Speaker C: Sweet.
00:30:53.722 - 00:30:55.322, Speaker D: Here, I'll unplug for you, brother.
00:30:55.418 - 00:30:56.282, Speaker A: Great presentation.
00:30:56.378 - 00:30:56.882, Speaker B: There you go.
00:30:56.938 - 00:30:57.734, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:30:58.034 - 00:31:01.974, Speaker A: Yeah. So how long has it been since you've started working on Valhalla?
00:31:02.714 - 00:31:16.716, Speaker D: So the entire process started back in April. Funny enough, that's when I got in touch with you guys. But the actual building of the app has, I think we decided to enter the hackathon a week or two after it started.
00:31:16.900 - 00:31:17.500, Speaker A: Wow.
00:31:17.612 - 00:31:30.044, Speaker D: Yeah. So it was like, yeah, it was a rush to actually build in that short timeframe. And, I mean, we've been building out a rust team with rapid innovation, who's our co founder. So, yeah, it's been pretty fun, but.
00:31:30.124 - 00:31:36.264, Speaker A: That'S amazing progress, man. And I also like the aspect of a community driven marketplace.
00:31:36.884 - 00:32:05.810, Speaker D: Yeah, it's pretty cool. I mean, we started, I mean, that's been my whole reason for getting into space. And the previous projects I've been involved in, we've always focused on building out daos and having Everything be community focused and run through a Token economy, basically, for me, that's the most fascinating part about this space. When we announced that we were doing that, there was massive positive FeedBack from the community. Clearly, there's a product market fit there, and people definitely want it on Solana.
00:32:05.922 - 00:32:25.398, Speaker A: Right. I think even with all of these nfTs, for example, you see, like, Monkey Dow, and they're all Kind of centered around community. And I think it's almost like, to a sense, product led growth is incredibly important, but community led growth is just as important, and it's seeming to be more important as time passes.
00:32:25.486 - 00:32:37.378, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm really excited to see how that plays out. I mean, you already see daos being popped up left, right, and center on Solana, and it's just going to get better and better. We want to contribute to that.
00:32:37.546 - 00:32:39.338, Speaker A: We're excited to see Valhalla launch, man.
00:32:39.386 - 00:32:40.666, Speaker D: Yeah, that'll be exciting.
00:32:40.810 - 00:32:41.066, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:32:41.090 - 00:32:51.666, Speaker D: So if anybody wants to learn more, you can just go to Valhalla IO and join the Discord and. Yeah, and we have. We'll be onboarding people into the closed beta in the coming weeks and.
00:32:51.770 - 00:32:52.058, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:32:52.106 - 00:32:54.402, Speaker D: Looking forward to chatting with everybody after.
00:32:54.578 - 00:32:55.498, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:32:55.546 - 00:32:56.774, Speaker C: All right, sounds good.
00:33:00.954 - 00:33:08.444, Speaker A: I am excited to announce our next presenter, Antoine from cryptoplase. Take it away.
00:33:11.424 - 00:33:47.460, Speaker E: Thank you. Super excited to be today to talk about. My name is Antoine. I'm going to talk about a project that we started in February, which is called cryptoplies. So why crypto, please? We were in, beginning of this year, we were in a restaurant. We were thinking, like, would be great if you could pay with crypto. And so the guy would come at the end to give you the bill and how do you want to pay crypto, please? So that was the idea and the vision.
00:33:47.460 - 00:34:30.830, Speaker E: We want to bring crypto everywhere, and we wanted to know how we could bring it everywhere. So it's been many years that I am in the, in the space and everyone here understand how it works. Cryptography understand how it works. A wallet understand how it works. An address. And usually when you want to send some crypto, you still need to know the address of the receiver, you still need to have the receiver, he needs to have a wallet. And so it's very easy to send crypto between us here.
00:34:30.830 - 00:35:27.494, Speaker E: It's not that easy to send crypto to your mother, to your friend, and eventually one day maybe to your dog, we'll see. So why it's very complex, because obviously before being able to send crypto, you need to have done a lot of steps. So we are building a mobile wallet on Solana with a special source. The idea here was what if we could send crypto to everyone with a link, and from this link, the user will be able to onboard into the solenoid ecosystem very easily, very quickly. So we are building a wallet with this special source. I will show you how it works now. Okay, so as you can see, it looks like traditional wallet mobile wallet.
00:35:27.494 - 00:36:01.244, Speaker E: We are building in on footer, on dart. So the experience will be really fast. So let's say that I want to send some Solana token to a friend who doesn't know nothing about Solana, but I have some Solana token. I would like to say give it a try. So I'm going to click on the send button and here normally on all the wallets, you're going to have the opportunity to send to a solar address. But in my case, it has nothing. He has no cellular address.
00:36:01.244 - 00:36:58.794, Speaker E: So I will be able to click on the second option and, you know, type the amount I want to send to him. So let's say $2. I say I'll give you, I'm going to tip you in Solana token and you will see how it's easy. So here I type the amount, I process the transaction, and at the end I get this pre filled message that I will be able to share with any social media platform. So it could be telegram, senial, email, and you name it. So here I'm going to send to my friend Quentin, click on the share payment link and I just click on the button, I share the message and he will get it. Once I share it, it goes back to the balance.
00:36:58.794 - 00:37:28.144, Speaker E: I have a little bit less Solana on my wallet. So how it works. So you can send this message on any social messaging platform. We think that that's an opportunity to actually expand the ecosystem. Why we choose Solana is because we believe that Solana is fast and cheap. So for this use case, it's perfect. The message you see here has two links.
00:37:28.144 - 00:38:05.312, Speaker E: The first one is very smart. He understands if the receiver already has the application, yes or no will be able to get some context around who is this user. If he doesn't have the application, it will provide you just a page. Hey, you need to install that like any marketing tool where you need to do something to get the money at the end. So it will actually click on the first link, install the mobile application. As soon as it arrives in the mobile application, it will show a second pop up. Hey, Monet is waiting for you.
00:38:05.312 - 00:38:37.972, Speaker E: Please click on the second link. And what happens in the background is actually we are having here a private key which is split into pieces. And by actually clicking on these two links, I will be able to recombine this private key. And so as soon as the wallet is able to recombine the private key, he's just moving the phones from a temporary address into his own address. And it's very simple. We spend a lot of time on that. We are almost there.
00:38:37.972 - 00:39:16.684, Speaker E: We think that could be a very important breakthrough in terms of adoption. So if you want to go into the detail of the protocol and how it works, you can go on our website. We are also on Twitter. So, guys, if you believe that payment leaks in crypto are inevitable, like us, please follow us on Twitter. Because, you know, to give some love a little bit. We're here just to push the ball forward and to try to, you know, expand the reach of what we are doing. And we believe that could be a way.
00:39:16.684 - 00:39:29.924, Speaker E: Thank you so much for your time. We are really excited about it. We will launch a mobile wallet end of this year. If you are interested, you can talk to me at the end. And thank you so much.
00:39:43.884 - 00:39:51.904, Speaker A: Anton. Thank you so much for that. Could you join me here? Yeah. So how did you kind of, like, you know, end up, like, tackling this problem?
00:39:52.244 - 00:40:21.234, Speaker E: Yeah. It's been many years that I'm in the space. I've been passionate about, like, you know, bringing more people into the space. Before doing this project, I was working on a name service in the cosmos ecosystem. And at the end, I realized that only way to get more people is not necessarily to have a username, but actually using links as a way to get more traction and get. So it's been a. Yeah, it's a long journey, but I believe we're close now.
00:40:21.234 - 00:40:21.906, Speaker E: Let's see.
00:40:22.010 - 00:40:34.186, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, no, for sure. And I totally agree with the simplification of all the functionalities. Specifically because for mass user adoption, we need to kind of, like, get away from all of that. Right, exactly.
00:40:34.290 - 00:41:19.360, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, we believe, like, with links, people can follow, like, step by step process, and at the end, you know, they can understand during this process what means a secret, secret recovery phase, you know, and with, you know, education in this process, then that's possible. It just needs to be gradual. So, for instance, in our wallet, we explain at the beginning of the onboarding, what is the secret recovery phrase, and then you have later notification to make sure they back up properly. But we don't block, you know, the flow, otherwise they are lost. And especially if you send money to a friend in a bar, they have no paper and no pen, so it's not the right time for him to write the phrase he need to do that. For sure.
00:41:19.360 - 00:41:23.096, Speaker E: It could be maybe, you know, the night after the party or the morning.
00:41:23.160 - 00:41:30.632, Speaker A: So, you know, gradual process payments is going to be absolutely huge. I truly think that Solana is kind of, like the place to be for it.
00:41:30.688 - 00:41:31.096, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:41:31.160 - 00:41:31.480, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:31.552 - 00:41:36.016, Speaker A: I mean, well, excited to, you know, witness crypto flees next year.
00:41:36.120 - 00:41:38.248, Speaker E: Thank you so much for having me.
00:41:38.376 - 00:41:39.484, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
00:41:43.144 - 00:41:50.364, Speaker A: Next we have Stella from Slope finance. So we're really excited. Please take it away.
00:41:50.864 - 00:42:03.072, Speaker F: Thank you, Tom. Can you guys hear me? Yeah. Great. Okay. My name is Stella Kwok. I'm the co founder of Slope Finance. We are the first mobile wallet for Solana.
00:42:03.072 - 00:42:55.592, Speaker F: And, yeah, I'm a bit nervous right now, so I'm not the one with the best speech skills in my team, but, yeah, it happens to be me here. And, like, in my eyes, everybody are cowards right now, so, yeah, and we are mobile wallet, and we launched three months ago, and we have 150K downloads right now. And we are not the competitor with Phantom because you simply can import your Phantom wallet to our apps to enjoy all types of features in our wallet. And there is explainer video. And I would like to show you guys all the ideas of our app. After that, I will give a demonstrator of the app, so please play the video first. Thank you, guys.
00:42:55.592 - 00:43:07.120, Speaker F: And also thank you, the tech team, because I'm the only person who are going to demo straight the app today, so went through some problem there. Yeah, yeah, please.
00:43:07.272 - 00:43:33.300, Speaker G: Glad you came. Here comes a walkthrough of the renovated Slope wallet. Let's get the hang of it. Born in June 2021, Slope finance has been dedicating to building the world's best mobile gateway for Solana ecosystem. Since its birth our first product, slope wallet, is simply not a mobile crypto wallet. Definitely, it contains all the basic functions such as send and receive. You can check the balance of the different types of assets you have.
00:43:33.300 - 00:44:22.068, Speaker G: Not only does the slope wallet support the mainstream tokens from the Solana network, but it allows users to add their custom tokens by themselves. Besides, your NFT collectibles can all be displayed here. Noticeably slope wallet offers something you cannot. Slope browser Adap aggregator can truly facilitate the connection with other popular projects under different categories, for instance, port finance and francium for DeFi, metaplex and rydium for NFT, Star Atlas for Gamefi. Doesn't it sound so cool? You can experience all of them at one go. Moreover, swap as a wallet of course, you are allowed to swap your digital assets whenever there is a must or have. You can swap different token via the liquidity pool.
00:44:22.068 - 00:45:18.316, Speaker G: Furthermore, slope nucleus, the heartbeat of Solana, ensures you can keep in sync with the rank, news and activity on Solana anytime, anywhere. It's a place we display the latest and fresh information about Solana Eco Slope NFT market as a platform for NFT transactions, we provide users with a better transaction experience. Slope NFT market can access you to the hottest NFT collectibles on the Solana network. At the same time, users can also find relevant information by searching for the name of the NFT or the name of the project. Let's stay ahead of the game. It is universally known that some users have multiple wallet accounts. In Slope wallet, you can manage your wallets in my profile and you can make changes for some system functions in the wallet, such as changing the login password, changing the light mode, opening Face ID or Touch ID, etcetera.
00:45:18.316 - 00:45:23.064, Speaker G: More to be explored only on Slope wallet. Enjoy the ride.
00:45:25.924 - 00:46:08.800, Speaker F: Yeah, thank you guys. So I'm going to do a demo of the app right here is my phone right now. So we're on minute and so simply you guys can see we have send and receive and functions and with different type of wallets. Right now I only have one wallet and the second thing is we have NFT markets here. We build this with metaplex and to be the first mobile NFT markets here in Solana. And we have a lot of features. So visualize management your nfts.
00:46:08.800 - 00:47:14.094, Speaker F: And also we have a ranks here so you can see all types of Solana nfts collectibles here and you can see the ranked by owners, ranked by tfbs, even ranked by the full price of it. And you can simply type into any collectibles and with the dashboards, it will show the price within one day and one week and even one month. And it can sort by the number of owners and sort by the number of token listed. And we also have the top ten owners there. And you can even step into the owner's address and to see what nfts they have in their address. I think the Internet is not very good right now anyway. And we also give the tag of the scammer address here so people can see like, which address it has a high possibility to be a scammer address.
00:47:14.094 - 00:48:07.324, Speaker F: And beside this, and we also have like, let's step into one of the collectibles, okay. With the listed of tokens, you can rank those tokens, give them a filter of the backgrounds, like blue and forest or whatever, and green, and to sort it, and you can type, you know, like multi filters and to sort which nfts you like. And we also have the rarities of the NFT for all types of collectibles. So yeah, this is it. And for our NFT market. So our ambition is to lower the entry barrier for all non crypto peoples. Since we are collaborating with Solana Labs right now, we are doing a pilot.
00:48:07.324 - 00:48:45.920, Speaker F: It's to deliver USDC payment to one of the world legislators. E commerce. Think about the scenario. If the e commerce customer come into, they want to pay something with USCC and pop into our wallet, and they can see whole NFT markets there. So it gives them access to all kind of collectibles there. So our logic is quite different from other wallets. So we will do a lot of efforts on user acquisitions and we would like to share the traffic to all types of dapps in Solana Ecos.
00:48:45.920 - 00:49:23.204, Speaker F: So I'll show you another column is dapp browser. So this is our dapper. We've already connected with over 80 Solana projects. It's ranked by defi, nft and gamefi. So when people step into this wallet, they can see there are tons of interesting dapps. They can just simply, you know, use their favorite dapps, for example, like radium. So they just click it and go to radium website and they can just simply swap any assets with here.
00:49:23.204 - 00:50:10.030, Speaker F: And it can connect wallets, it can connect all types of wallets, even like phantom software, etcetera. And yeah, there are a lot of things. And besides the dapp browser, and we have a token swap feature right now, it's only SPL token at this moment. Our new version will be launched in the middle of next month. So it will be a cross chain swap so people can simply just swap your ETH or whatever. We will support ETH, we will support Terra, and we will support BSC and the next version so people can swap their native tokens to SPL native tokens. So the cross chain swap happened before.
00:50:10.030 - 00:50:50.568, Speaker F: Our app is they are all swapped from wrapped tokens to native tokens. So our solution is to swap native tokens to native tokens. This is another way to lower the entry barrier for, you know, like retail users because they don't need to understand what's happening beneath this. We help them to change the reps tokens to native tokens. And the last one is a very interesting one. So this is, we call it Solana nucleus, actually the name is from Solana Capital. They gave us the idea to have this name.
00:50:50.568 - 00:51:49.024, Speaker F: So it's aggregator, it's a one stop aggregator of the whole Solana eco informations. We have ranks here and all types of SPL tokens. And we have news here. It's about all the Solana Eco news. So we have Solana today and we have a lot of news, fundraising news and new product and new features coming up. And also we have the activities, actually we have the latest ido information for different type of projects. And when you step into this column and you can see where they did the ido and if it's ongoing one, you can simply just participate the ido through this link.
00:51:49.024 - 00:52:43.018, Speaker F: Yeah, here is it. The Gucci effects they are doing IO this one is done. And also we have like AMA things for all types of Solana eco projects, like Larix, like Francium. And if you get into this subpage and you can see the links of the AMA's. So you can, you can just get all the ideas, all the questions asked from the AMA's and you can read it afterwards and to get more ideas about the projects there. So why we are doing this is just, we would like the Solana user to get all the information, just one stop. They don't need to jump out of the app to go to Twitter or discord or whatever telegram group to get those information.
00:52:43.018 - 00:53:19.620, Speaker F: It's too many places. So they just need to use our mobile wallet to get those information. And simply they can jump to the token swap page to buy those assets. Or if it's an NFT and you can just jump into our NFT market to buy it. And if the NFT is from like, I mean, different projects or different collectibles in your wallet, happens in your wallet, you can just simply sell your nfts in this market. It's connect with Metaplex. So, yeah, and I think that's it.
00:53:19.620 - 00:54:15.494, Speaker F: This is a demonstration of that. And we are like, we're not only talk, we are not only building the payment option for the e commercing, we are also talking with several different type of web. Two companies, for example, sweatpoint, they have like 50 million users. They are a huge web, two companies, and they would like to do tokenized and they want to involve like crypto wallet. And we think they have a huge amount of users and we can give them a very, very simple, straightforward UI UX to let their users to use to trade cryptos and to buy nfts to get exposure of all types of information. So that is our ambition. And we have another innovation is to even lower the inter barrier for non crypto peoples is we are building.
00:54:18.234 - 00:54:18.498, Speaker C: We.
00:54:18.506 - 00:54:46.176, Speaker F: Are using biometric status to generate and restore wallet. So people only can use their face or fingerprints and they can generate a wallet. They will be a part of the C phase. Since I like try 100 times to explain to my family members, my non crypto friends, what is Defi. And you have to open a website in your laptop. They have no idea about that. And they also have no idea about what is CFIS to write it down.
00:54:46.176 - 00:54:51.504, Speaker F: So we will give them a simple and straightforward option to do.
00:54:51.544 - 00:55:13.678, Speaker A: Absolutely. That's fantastic. Thank you so much for. It's going to bring about another whole level of massive adoption. Thank you so much for your presentation, Stella. So we've come to the end of our demo session today. We do have another demo session moderated by our very own Andrea from Solana foundation.
00:55:13.678 - 00:55:39.684, Speaker A: So join us then for an additional look into all of our ecosystem projects. Thank you once again to all of the developers that are building on Solana. We know the commitment, we know how much effort it takes to really work with teams and, you know, build something out. Like it's truly challenging. We know that. We respect it. And thank you so much.
00:55:39.684 - 00:55:43.024, Speaker A: And I'll give it away to Ryan. Thank you.
