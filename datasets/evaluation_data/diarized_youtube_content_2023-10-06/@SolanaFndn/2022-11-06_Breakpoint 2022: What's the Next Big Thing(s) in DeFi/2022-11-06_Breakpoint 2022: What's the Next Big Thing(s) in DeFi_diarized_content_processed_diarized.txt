00:00:00.440 - 00:00:32.496, Speaker A: All right, good afternoon, everyone. I'm Megha and I'm a research analyst from Nansen. Nansen is a blockchain analytics platform where users can look at the metrics and dashboards for their favorite chains and projects. And today I'm joined by four panelists. We have Daniel, Jacob, Julian and Rupert. And now I would like to invite them to introduce themselves. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself, who you represent, and what your project actually helps Defi in general?
00:00:32.640 - 00:00:58.234, Speaker B: Yeah. Hi everyone, my name is Daniel. I work at Lulu. Lulo is a brand new lending protocol that's built on top of order books. So we've kind of gone ahead and gotten rid of the lending pool completely and rebuilt lending to be more peer to peer results in a lot more capital efficiency. It can scale risk in many different ways. So we're trying to fix some of the issues that that exists with DeFi lending.
00:00:59.494 - 00:01:03.374, Speaker A: Thank you, Daniel. And next we have Jacob from GSR.
00:01:03.494 - 00:01:14.714, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm Jacob. I'm the CEO of GSR. We're a market maker in the digital asset space, Defi trader and also a venture investor.
00:01:15.294 - 00:01:17.878, Speaker A: Thanks, Jacob. Next we have Julian as well.
00:01:18.006 - 00:02:04.204, Speaker D: Hi guys, my name is Juan Butelou, I'm CEO of stake Capital Group. We also do all type of quantitative trading. So market making, liquidation. We also run family office investment in a space and we also create project Stackdao asset management for retail -300 million rec news, the underground investigative firm talking about exploits and also releasing some cool, cool stuff about videos. Blackpool is the asset manager for nfts and we are the biggest one in the space. We run for example, games like surveyor and. Yeah, that's it.
00:02:04.504 - 00:02:08.256, Speaker A: Amazing. Thanks, Julian. Now we have Rupert as well.
00:02:08.360 - 00:02:25.654, Speaker E: Good afternoon everybody. I'm Rupert from amulet. We're a Defi COVID protocol. We're the first on Solana, in fact the only one on Solana right now, built for the rust ecosystem and looking to provide safety for a bigger, wider, more future proof defi.
00:02:26.074 - 00:02:47.578, Speaker A: Amazing. Thanks Rupert. And now in this session, we're going to be discussing on what's the next big things in Defi. And it comes down to, first, the values of the defi itself. We know that what makes Defi ideal are the values in it. We have decentralization. It's being trustless, permissionless.
00:02:47.578 - 00:03:00.834, Speaker A: Everyone can join defi. What do you think the next iteration of Defi will be? What kind of values will they bring in the future? Maybe. Jacob, you can start.
00:03:01.334 - 00:03:42.274, Speaker C: Right. I think last year when we had this similar conversation, everything was around interoperability and that was sort of the buzzword of the time. I think today, there's a bunch of stuff which is very important that is happening in Defi. One is the speed and latency work that is done by a lot of people. Bloxroute came up with their Solana integration. I think it was today or yesterday, which is quite exciting for speed. I think we talked about this before.
00:03:42.274 - 00:04:28.322, Speaker C: Serenowledge proof will have a big impact. I think sort of the permissionless defi trading going forward in the future. And the last thing that we have seen over the, I guess, sort of last few months, particularly in the last few days as well, there's been a lot of debate whether a lot sort of like, how do we improve amms, and looking at LP rewards versus impermanent loss. So that's very important. And the last thing I think is Mev awareness, which is something that we focus quite a lot on. And that's obviously sort of front running, trading, and so on and so forth, which is happening in Defi. So, lots to talk about.
00:04:28.498 - 00:04:32.098, Speaker A: That's highly interesting. Maybe, Rupert, you can have something to add.
00:04:32.186 - 00:05:23.634, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, my traditional defi value, so to speak, I feel included a lot of accessibility, which is something, I think, in Solana, we've done a lot to help normal people getting into the space. But beyond that now, and especially if we look at something like rect, there is now a whole lot of safety issues that we then need to cover off with inside the space. And I think if we add that into our values, Defi is a bit of an unstoppable machine, and we're able to allow everybody to have access to it and be safe and utilize it in the way that it should be, and replace certain elements of traditional finance.
00:05:24.294 - 00:05:27.158, Speaker A: That's correct. Daniel, do you have anything to add?
00:05:27.206 - 00:06:02.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess the one thing I'll add is efficiency. I think Defi, like finance, at the end of the day, is just about money. That's what it drives. Right. And I do think a lot of DeFi primitives are still inefficient in their design, and there's a lot of room to actually become more market driven, more competitive with tradfi, with alternatives. I think a lot of DeFi protocols, they have users that are crypto native, and they're going to be on crypto protocols regardless. So if we want to actually compete and bring in more people, we need to be competitive with everything.
00:06:02.520 - 00:06:08.884, Speaker B: And so I think efficiency in getting the most for your investment or the work you're doing is really important.
00:06:09.344 - 00:06:12.128, Speaker A: That's correct. And Julian, do you have anything to add?
00:06:12.216 - 00:07:22.954, Speaker D: Yes, we mentioned different technological aspect of what could make defile to be stronger. But I think we're missing one of the strongest point is how we could actually integrate with regulators and get institutions and get traditional finance to use DeFi in such a way that's bringing more value to them, but also not stopping people from building. And I think we have, especially in Solana conference and what happened with SBF and FTX and all the discussion about regulations and how we are getting DeFi and the community of builders into this ecosystem without stopping them from building. But then coming back to the point of Jacob, you know, so we have two different big components in DeFi and traditional finance. In order to make this space and the vision of decentralization happen, first we have to work with regulators. We have to work with institutions that they see this space not as a risk for them. And also major, I think this is the biggest thing that we have to focus ourselves is privacy.
00:07:22.954 - 00:08:01.044, Speaker D: Without privacy, then we'll never be able to build decentralization and make this vision of DeFi happens. But at the same time, privacy brings risk for regulators. So we have to think about as a community, as a society, how we can build and bring privacy into the talks and the technology by helping regulators to understand the concept and the tool and stopping the people that will use privacy as risk, posing risk to the society. But without privacy and fully private transaction, I don't think we can make Defi happens.
00:08:01.704 - 00:08:43.624, Speaker A: Thank you, Jillian. So those are the important values that needs to be in the next iteration of Defi. And we have touched a little bit on innovation and regulation as well. Maybe first we can talk, talk about the regulation itself. Julian has intro a bit around that. Do you guys think that it would be a bad thing or is it a good thing to have more regulation in the space? Will it help with more onboarding new users, for example? I do know that at the moment, with a lot of bridgehacks and bad governance, a lot of users are being put off Defi. Do you think regulation will help more users to get into Defi? And Jacob?
00:08:43.664 - 00:09:46.174, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say, if we're talking about regulation in terms of fair and orderly markets and consumer protection, I think it's great. That's sort of if defi can have that same integrity or more integrity than traditional financial markets, I think that's a huge leap forward and something that we should move towards. But as some sort of, you know, we're also talking about the concept of permissionless finance. And this is what I mentioned before, where things like, things like zero knowledge proof, and, you know, other sort of technologies where we need to be able to have a permissionless finance where we still can verify that, you know, we're. We can trade within this space. Otherwise we come into this absurd reality where our most sacred details get shared with every single person that we've never met. And that's what's happening in real life today.
00:09:46.174 - 00:10:05.236, Speaker C: Everybody goes around with their passports, and you show your passport to every man and his dog continuously throughout the day. I don't think that's the future of Defi, but I think fair, orderly markets and consumer protection, super valuable. And permissionless finance, those are.
00:10:05.340 - 00:10:16.132, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's the balance between permission, permissionless, and a little bit of consumer protection. Does anyone have.
00:10:16.268 - 00:10:16.676, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:16.740 - 00:10:16.916, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:10:16.940 - 00:10:47.310, Speaker B: I wanted to add one thing, too, is I think when you think about regulation, like, compliance is almost always somehow tied to it. And I've been thinking a lot about compliance, and Defi has a lot of great things about it. Like, it's transparent completely. It's got. Privacy is definitely something we need to think about. But I think we need to also think about compliance tooling. What does that look like? I think right now, everyone just takes what we have and tries to bolt it on top or on the side of Defi.
00:10:47.310 - 00:11:26.150, Speaker B: I just wonder if there's more homegrown compliance tooling that can be created that is private, is permissionless, but at the same time has, like, the attributes we need for, you know, governments or regulation. And I think the big blocker to that now is we don't really have that much clarity on, like, what the exact rules are. And I think we need those in order to, like, builders to be able to go out and be like, okay, great, these are the rules. Like, I'm gonna go and, like, build something really cool around it so it fits the criteria of governments, fits the criteria of users, and doesn't end up being, like, a very, either, like, permission solution or something that's, like, very not private. So I think that's. I think compliance is a big. A big piece here that we need to think about.
00:11:26.342 - 00:11:29.406, Speaker A: Noted. And, Rupert, maybe you have.
00:11:29.550 - 00:12:26.034, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, look, I don't think regulation is a silver bullet to solve all the problems and to just allow tons of retail adoption. I think it's. It helps. But we can see in traditional markets, people will still skirt around regulations in any which way they can in order to make the highest yield that they can. And it's not a. I do believe that regulation in the space done right is a great opportunity for us all. But regulation that is rushed out with little forethought on how it's going to impact the actual industry is only going to push people to work their way around it, and then there will be more risks in that particular area.
00:12:26.034 - 00:12:34.836, Speaker E: But done right, I think it's a great opportunity for us all. And privacy is a big part of that to tag on. To your point, Julian.
00:12:34.910 - 00:12:58.536, Speaker A: All right, I do actually have something to add, like in one of the books that I read from Harari, is that sometimes the government is a bit slow in following the pace of technology itself. Do you think in the future of DeFi, would it be government? Or do you think the governance of a project itself that will make regulation, for example, Julianne, maybe you have thought.
00:12:58.560 - 00:13:53.948, Speaker D: On this coming back and then jumping to the question is, I believe that the more good regulation, the better, meaning that the more regulation we have in this space that is a little bit quite toxic and chaotic, then is bringing a lot of protections and also pushing the space towards better society. People tend to believe that regulations and states or nations governments are against the people. But it's actually the opposite. Governments, nation states, regulations are built to serve the people. The only enemies to people building defy and all different things is lobbying. Lobbying are the entities that are against nations and regulators. And they're pushing regulators, they're pushing nation states and governments to act sometimes and more often against population because their game and the incentive is to.
00:13:53.948 - 00:14:32.698, Speaker D: They have an economic incentive to do so. So I think with DeFi, what we have as a community and people building builders is to show regulators, governments and nation states that this technology will help them to serve the people on the ground. So they could. This is a good example with central bank. Central bank issuing stable coins, they can if they want. And that was, there's a big fight between central bank and commercial bank. People believe that commercial bank are big friends with central bank, which is the opposite, because central bank, they would like to communicate directly to the people on the ground.
00:14:32.698 - 00:15:10.494, Speaker D: They would like to serve and distribute services. So if we help central bank and governments to understand that this technology will help them to communicate directly with the people, selling them services, having access to insurance, communications and all the different things, then it's a big win for them. That's why people usually say regulations and governments, they are against us. But it's not true. They are normally elected to serve the people. But then you have people in the middleman that try to interfere, but it's a big opportunity for society to regain control, especially for governments and regulators to help people.
00:15:10.794 - 00:15:15.474, Speaker A: Yeah, amazing answer. Thank you, Julian. Rupert, do you have anything to add?
00:15:19.414 - 00:15:20.954, Speaker E: No. In short.
00:15:23.214 - 00:15:38.442, Speaker A: Daniel, do you have any opinion on my question? Whether or not it should be the platform itself, the decentralized platform, maybe the DAO, creating some regulation for the Defi? Or do you think it should be government in general?
00:15:38.578 - 00:16:00.050, Speaker B: I think. I don't know if this is an exact answer, but the way I think about it is DeFi protocols should probably build in a way where they can enable regulation and compliance. I don't think they necessarily need to be. I don't know. It depends on what you're building, obviously. But if you're building just a layer that connects people, there's perfect. Like Swift is a good example.
00:16:00.050 - 00:16:25.314, Speaker B: Like they don't actually enforce compliance, but they are built in a way where you can easily do it. If you're using Swift, I think DeFi protocols maybe have to be thought in the same way where your infrastructure, your technology, you're connecting people, you're offering them services, products, whatever. And compliance regulation is something that's kind of doable and you can, like facilitate it, but it's maybe not necessarily your direct responsibility. So in that sense, maybe it isn't Dao's, I would say.
00:16:25.974 - 00:16:54.914, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, now we are going to touch on the exciting part, which is the innovation. Like previously in DeFi, we have seen the massive growth since, I'd say, 2019, 2020. We started with lending the conventional automated market maker LP's, and then afterwards we have the liquid tokens, liquid staking. What do you think will be the next iteration of DeFi, the upcoming one? Maybe you have some thoughts on that.
00:16:58.114 - 00:17:51.316, Speaker C: So, historically, what really drove DeFi summer back in the day was very attractive yields, which in itself was quite long term unsustainable. Then we saw sort of a bunch of innovations on moving away from a central limit order book, but having a bonding curve driving price discovery in DeFi. It's still the case that DeFi is lagging CFI in terms of price discovery for various reasons. I think we going to see an improvement there. Need to keep building and making that more efficient. Again, as I mentioned in the beginning, I think we need to. I mean, this concept of providing passive liquidity and earning a yield is getting challenged, rightly so.
00:17:51.316 - 00:18:37.474, Speaker C: And I think that's very good. It's a little bit like picking pennies in front of a steamroller. So you're having a huge amount of wing risk and that wing risk, it's what's basically moving your expected return to be below zero, which is unfortunate, but there are a bunch of ways that you can take away those wings. And that brings me to what I think is the move for Defi is everyone who's building, in terms of the option space within Defi. I think it has this property of sustainable yield. So volatility is worth a loss of money. Crypto is very volatile.
00:18:37.474 - 00:19:02.514, Speaker C: So if you hold a crypto that's volatile, it's worth a lot of money. You should get paid for that. Whether it's in centralized finance or decentralized finance, is actually sustainable. And we haven't because of the sort of leverage and staking and air drops and all of that existence. We've all been chasing those yields.
00:19:05.174 - 00:19:05.462, Speaker B: And.
00:19:05.478 - 00:19:11.034, Speaker C: Now, when those are away, I think that is a perfectly viable period for us to innovate a little bit in the option space.
00:19:11.134 - 00:19:11.370, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:11.402 - 00:19:12.498, Speaker C: And we're already seeing that.
00:19:12.586 - 00:19:16.442, Speaker A: Noted the sustainable yield. And maybe Rupert or Julian.
00:19:16.538 - 00:19:57.238, Speaker E: Yeah, so. Oh, sorry, buddy. Just to add on to that, I think the evolution looks like more real business models. This idea that it's just emissions from the token to sustain these wild apys was just never sustainable in the first place. Right. And it brought a lot of eyes to the space, which is great. But actually, the reality is, it's taking those traditional models that work in traditional finance and bringing them into defi, done in the right way, to remove the inefficiencies in traditional finance.
00:19:57.238 - 00:20:38.344, Speaker E: So the classic example is like, if you want to send money around the world, you have to send it through six different banks, right? It's all done in the background, but it typically, it passes, and there's so much inefficiency there. And obviously, updating a ledger is much more efficient. But when you apply financial services sector on top of that, there are even more inefficiencies that can be wiped out. And obviously, if you wipe out the inefficiencies with a traditional business model, you make more yield. And that's how we're going to sustain, and that's how we're going to survive. It's going to make be a very obvious decision for somebody to use a DeFi protocol, or to build a new one, or to build the next evolution of it.
00:20:39.004 - 00:20:42.676, Speaker A: Thank you. And Julian, you were about to say something.
00:20:42.780 - 00:21:47.766, Speaker D: I think there was good points from Jacob and Mullet. Is that the reason why people jump into DeFi is because they were assessing the yield? So if traditional finance institutions and all the new start like existing stock, existing project, like Twitter, Instagram and all different, those different companies, they start offering also financial or services with good yield because they will. What we're seeing is like a yield from traditional finance actually now getting closer to yield in decentralized finance. So if the retail is in DeFi because of the yield, they can quickly move into traditional services and there will be no problem for them. They're not attached to Defi because of the value they attach because of the yield, unfortunately. So this space will need to move into more sophisticated product, meaning that instead of doing some really basic lending and automark and market making, this is not new, this being around for decades. But that's a neutral strategy.
00:21:47.766 - 00:22:51.848, Speaker D: Long term yield, like Jacob mentioned, stability of those field. And then you can borrow against make like in normal life for buying, purchasing a house, or doing all these type of different things. This is the future of Defi, is a future where by basic you get the same products as traditional finance, but a little bit more. You have the same accessibility, you have the same user experience, and then you get stuff that you will normally get if you were wealth manager, or if you add quite a huge amount of wealth and you could have access to those products in traditional finance. Well, Defi will need to provide them to retail, but not people being, lending, borrowing, leveraging, hedging, all different things that they have to do themselves. At the moment, we need to build applications that are super simple. We had a few actors that tried in a space like for example Celsius, blockfi and all different things that failed because they also want a little bit to degen on credit and boring.
00:22:51.848 - 00:23:18.334, Speaker D: But yeah, those type of applications are. The futures of DeFi is trying to offer very complex, very sophisticated products without the need of understanding the complexity of the technology. And this is where we're moving into being able to use Internet without knowing the protocol, being able to use email without being knowing that SMTP basically removing the protocol level. You offer products to retail and they don't need to understand. This is DeFi blockchain nfts behind.
00:23:18.454 - 00:23:22.662, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. And Daniel, do you have any thoughts?
00:23:22.758 - 00:23:47.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Julian has a great point. I think the UX is definitely important. I'd say to add to that, if you look under the UX at the actual protocol, I think there's a lot there too. I think the future of Defi does not look like it looks today. I think we've talked about like Amm pools being inefficient. I think lending protocols are inefficient. There's a lot of things that we've built.
00:23:47.110 - 00:24:23.906, Speaker B: We started on Ethereum, right? We started on Ethereum. L1, it's expensive, it's a little slow. The primitives we built there five, six years ago are probably not the primitives that are going to be the dominant player. At least I think the dominant player in the next five, five years. Right? I think we started with the v zeros, and now the v one s and V two s are going to come out. And I think as we have, like, scaling solutions, cheaper transactions, faster transactions, Ux layers, where it doesn't even matter what protocol you're on, there's a lot of room to build protocols in different ways and squeeze out more yield, because at the end of the day, real yield will be what matters to users.
00:24:23.930 - 00:24:24.138, Speaker E: Right?
00:24:24.186 - 00:24:41.204, Speaker B: Yield, that isn't a Ponzi yield. That's actual, you know, that's real. That's going to your, you know, bank account or wallet. And so I think ux is really important, but the pieces underneath are going to look really, really different. I think that's the most exciting, at least, obviously very biased, but that's the most exciting piece of DeFi for me.
00:24:41.504 - 00:24:57.104, Speaker A: All right, thank you. And we have a little bit of time left. What do you think would be the innovation that people bring from code and would bring from traditional finance into DeFi, like on the next iteration of DeFi itself?
00:25:00.164 - 00:25:01.220, Speaker B: I can take this one. I'll stop.
00:25:01.252 - 00:25:01.780, Speaker A: Ok.
00:25:01.932 - 00:25:33.016, Speaker B: I think it's risk, probably. Shradfy is extremely good at managing, thinking pricing risk, and I think the way they do it, the systems they've built to do that, that's what DeFi will end up having to do, too. It's going to be about pricing risk. Lend against more risky assets, you could trade more risky assets, you could trade volatility, you could not be so exposed. Like, it's all about risk. And so I think tradfi does that really well. So that's what I hope they can bring into DeFi is better risk management.
00:25:33.016 - 00:25:36.124, Speaker B: And then how do we package that up in nice ux, like Julian says?
00:25:36.464 - 00:25:38.936, Speaker A: Do you think there's already a platform.
00:25:39.000 - 00:25:47.494, Speaker B: On that, or I guess all DeFi protocols are, in a sense, a platform for risk? I'd say, yeah, awesome.
00:25:48.034 - 00:26:46.194, Speaker C: I think that was a great choice, actually. I think risk management, coming as a traditional financial risk management, is sort of a little bit foregone. Sometimes in DeFi, especially when you're seeing someone offering a 30% yield, there's a reason why they do it, and that reason might be very damning means you should go out. I think we also have sort of counterparty risk that we don't really think about protocol risk that we have implemented. I think we have a 15 people risk team, which I think is large for digital assets. But if you take the other way around, the things that we get exposed to in DeFi, quite a lot is very sophisticated hacking risk, manipulations of oracles and so on and so forth. These are things that regulation won't help with.
00:26:46.194 - 00:26:58.994, Speaker C: These are things that I don't think the traditional finance can help us with. But I do think that bridging that knowledge to traditional finance probably could have done.
00:26:59.854 - 00:27:02.474, Speaker A: Thank you, Rupert.
00:27:02.814 - 00:28:00.364, Speaker E: I mean, guys, thank you for sharing my own product. You're absolutely correct. Until we smash out the risk, we're not going to be bringing in the institutional funds. We're not going to be bringing in that massive growth of retail as well. And we've got multiple areas that aside from just the price and the huge volatility, like you say, the smart contract risk, the stablecoin dpegs, the manipulations that we've seen in the last couple of weeks on various different protocols, all of this is an education part. All of this ties in to what the future of DeFi holds. And we're only going to be able to grow this out if we cover these gaps, if we utilize things like insurance in order to incentivize and cover those risk areas.
00:28:01.424 - 00:28:03.480, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. And Julian.
00:28:03.512 - 00:28:32.488, Speaker D: Yeah. Monitoring tool like Nansen doing analytics, they are great. But what about the 99.99% of all the assets in the world are not currently in DeFi? What about bounce swaps, real estate? My point is demand, for example, in curve, we're doing 500 million, between 500 million and 3 billion volume per day. This is nice across DeFi. Couple of billions, FX, 6 trillion. We all talking about DeFi as like big.
00:28:32.488 - 00:29:07.444, Speaker D: This is big. But compared to trade fight, this is nothing. This is like a drop in the ocean. So I think what terrify can come is like the big, the big wealth, the big guys, the big assets. And unless we help them to use DeFi and for example, like banks, what societies general did. I think the issue like bounce on blockchain, we have a few different institutions that are starting to do that. When we get those guys jumping into DeFi, then they will bring all this monitoring tool, the risk asset management, also under collateralized DeFi, because for now, this is nothing.
00:29:07.444 - 00:29:29.266, Speaker D: Then this will completely change the world of DeFi. And we'll be playing with guys that been their job for decades. Like quants from all, some good school and good company in the world. But Blackrock, all those guys, those represent the finance in this world that Defi at the moment is pretty much very small.
00:29:29.370 - 00:29:35.202, Speaker A: Okay. So if you could pick one, like, what do you think would be. Would be the most lucrative?
00:29:35.298 - 00:29:35.946, Speaker D: Bonds. Yeah.
00:29:36.010 - 00:29:36.442, Speaker A: Bonds.
00:29:36.498 - 00:29:40.090, Speaker E: All right, so what you're saying is there's an insane opportunity for growth.
00:29:40.242 - 00:29:40.626, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:29:40.690 - 00:29:41.374, Speaker B: Huge.
00:29:41.794 - 00:29:44.134, Speaker D: If they don't kill d five before.
00:29:44.474 - 00:30:02.404, Speaker A: All right, I think we're running out of time. Now. I would like to summarize. So today we have talk about both value proposition, innovation and regulation in the next iteration of DeFi. And we are looking for something in the balance of permissionless and.
00:30:07.704 - 00:30:08.760, Speaker E: Reducing the risk.
00:30:08.872 - 00:30:27.644, Speaker A: Yes. And the next thing for the next big things in DeFi is basically being brought from threatfi, and we can look at how the threatfi has been managing risks all this time. And that's all from us. Thank you for our panelists today, and thank you for Solana breakpoint for this session. Thank you.
