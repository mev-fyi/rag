00:00:04.320 - 00:00:06.809, Speaker A: Today I'm joined by Claudio. So please tell us what are you building?
00:00:06.937 - 00:00:24.185, Speaker B: So oldomaze is a name service protocol that is doing custom anything domains on Solana. Until now we work with multiple projects like Bonk, Wan, Slurf, monkeydao Super Team, just doing, let's say bonk or let's bonk domains for example.
00:00:24.305 - 00:00:26.535, Speaker A: Awesome. So everyone can just use them right now, right?
00:00:26.665 - 00:00:38.011, Speaker B: Exactly. So they're usable, they are integrated. You can use them on Phantom and Solflare. You can see them in Bird Eye, so in Solana fm. So really, really happy about this.
00:00:38.123 - 00:00:39.899, Speaker A: Awesome. So get yourself a domain.
00:00:39.987 - 00:00:40.235, Speaker B: Thank you.
