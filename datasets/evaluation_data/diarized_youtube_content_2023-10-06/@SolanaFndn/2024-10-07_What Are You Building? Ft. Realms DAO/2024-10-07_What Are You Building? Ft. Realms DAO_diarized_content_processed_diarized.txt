00:00:04.360 - 00:00:06.417, Speaker B: Today I'm joined by Dean. Please tell us, what are you building?
00:00:06.481 - 00:00:09.529, Speaker A: Yeah, we're building support for token extensions in Realms.
00:00:09.577 - 00:00:11.473, Speaker B: Cool. What does this allow people to do?
00:00:11.529 - 00:00:19.009, Speaker A: Yeah, so they'll be able to access all of the different features you have in token extensions and create a DAO using a token extension token.
00:00:19.057 - 00:00:24.601, Speaker B: So what are you actually building for the people with these extensions in Realms? Yeah, that's a.
00:00:24.633 - 00:00:33.413, Speaker A: Great question. We're unlocking a lot of creativity. One of the mixes that I've discovered is one between permanent delegate and transfer hooks where you can set up election cycles.
00:00:33.469 - 00:00:37.845, Speaker B: Awesome. That sounds super cool. And you are super early, so thank you very much for building this and for being here.
00:00:37.885 - 00:00:38.525, Speaker A: Thank you for having me.
