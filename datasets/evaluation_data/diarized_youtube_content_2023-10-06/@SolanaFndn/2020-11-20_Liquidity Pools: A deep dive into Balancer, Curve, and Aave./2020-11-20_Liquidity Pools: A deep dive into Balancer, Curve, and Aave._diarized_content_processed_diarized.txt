00:00:09.920 - 00:00:12.286, Speaker A: Alrighty, we're live. Welcome.
00:00:12.390 - 00:00:18.286, Speaker B: Welcome, everyone, to the 9th event of the Solana wormhole hackathon. Today we have an incredible panel for y'all.
00:00:18.310 - 00:00:18.614, Speaker C: Today.
00:00:18.694 - 00:00:50.574, Speaker B: We have Fernando, who is the founder and CEO of Balancer. We have Emilio, who is a lead blockchain developer for Aave. We have Michael, who is the founder of Curve. And then we have Anatoly, who is the founder and CEO of Solana. Today we're going to take a deep dive into different liquidity pools and how they work throughout various protocols. And so each guest is going to take some time explaining how their individual protocol works. And then we'll answer guest questions and chats from in the panel as well.
00:00:50.574 - 00:00:57.594, Speaker B: So I think, toli, I'll let you take from there. And we can just do a quick introduction of everyone. And I'm going to jump off stage.
00:00:57.714 - 00:00:58.494, Speaker C: Have fun.
00:00:59.194 - 00:01:19.414, Speaker A: Awesome. I think we probably have a lot of folks joining again. But, Michael, since you've introduced yourself before, you can do a quick one. But I'd love to hear everyone else's role at their project and how they view the space. Go for it. Michael, too. So we'll start with you.
00:01:20.074 - 00:01:35.174, Speaker D: All right. Yeah, well, I'm Michael, the founder of Curve. And curve is, as you probably already know from previous panels, is automatic market maker for stablecoins. And. Yeah, I think I wouldn't take longer.
00:01:37.594 - 00:01:38.534, Speaker A: Emilio?
00:01:40.234 - 00:02:01.316, Speaker E: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Hi, guys. I am Emilio. I am one of the core devs of Abe. We are. Me and another six or seven guys are essentially there responsible for the core development of the smart contracts and the front end of Abe. Really excited to be here.
00:02:01.316 - 00:02:14.224, Speaker E: And especially because integration between AMM and landing protocols is something that I think will be very, very interesting in the upcoming months. Yeah.
00:02:14.844 - 00:02:17.324, Speaker A: Yeah. Fernando.
00:02:17.944 - 00:02:43.942, Speaker C: Hey, guys, this is Fernando. I'm co founder and CEO of Balancer. So, Balancer is a protocol for programmable liquidity. So it allows you to create liquidity pools that are not restricted to two tokens and 50 50 weights. Like uniswap. You can add two or more tokens now up to eight, and you can choose different weights. So you can have, like, a pool with 10% WAF, 10% WBTC, and 80% die if you're conservative.
00:02:43.942 - 00:03:11.354, Speaker C: And what balancer does is it automatically lets arbors rebalance your pool for you. So what you have is essentially an index fund, where you get paid for providing liquidity, as opposed to paying a fee, which happens in a conventional financial world. Like, you go to fidelity, you have to pay, like, a monthly fee to give them your money to let them like rebalance it for you. So yeah, that's balancer in a nutshell.
00:03:13.334 - 00:03:26.074, Speaker A: I think like, if I hope I'm not mistaken, but I think like even aave underneath the hood with this automatic interest rate adjustment, has a similar kind of like mental model to an automatic market maker.
00:03:28.094 - 00:04:32.280, Speaker E: Well, partially in the sense that, like the market, our market is algorithmic, so it adjusts in real time to demand an offer. In the sense that, like, the more liquidity there is available, the cheapest it is to borrow it. And on the opposite side, like, the less liquidity available, the more expensive it is to borrow. Which of course achieves two goals at the same time. The first goal is to attract more depositors when the interest rates are higher, high, and at the same time maybe like incentivize borrowers to close their position to provide liquidity. Our protocol specifically optimizes around a certain threshold of utilization. What AAVE tries to achieve is always to have some kind of fractional reserve always available for depositors to be able to withdraw even.
00:04:32.280 - 00:05:33.460, Speaker E: It was quite interesting during these months, observing like how the protocol behaved, especially like with the yield farming. It was interesting when compounds compound started with the. Initially started with the yield farming, that there was a lot of demand to borrow stable coins on ABe. Because people were using ABe as a bridge to like, for assets that were not supported on compound to move the liquidity, to borrow stable coins to yield farm on compound, essentially. It was also essentially very, very interesting to observe how the product was behaving during like, the yield farming craze with a lot of assets, not only stable coins being borrowed, to actually use them to deposit in the different farms. And we collected a lot of data. And I think in the upcoming months, we'll come with interesting ideas regarding the adjustment of interest rate models.
00:05:33.460 - 00:05:36.224, Speaker E: There is a lot of research on the field as well.
00:05:38.764 - 00:06:43.844, Speaker A: This was like, so in March, when we were launching main, I noticed that these automatic financial products started to gain a little bit of traction. I think it was still pretty small TVL and I kind of looked into it a little more. And I was kind of blown away by this idea that it's algorithmic and it's passive and there's no expiration, that it's continuous and kind of like turn traditional finance on its head. Because when you deal with like interest rates and options and all this other stuff, it's like, it's very much not like something humans can understand, right? You have to buy a bond, it expires at a certain date, right? It generates yield after that, and then the price of the actual thing fluctuates and totally different from the yield itself. So I honestly think that these products are kind of like revolutionary. Like, even though the stuff I think has been theorized since the seventies, I think like partially the, the slowness of ethereum made this thing possible. Right? It was a forcing function.
00:06:43.844 - 00:07:03.984, Speaker A: So I don't know what you guys do. You guys think that there's a chance that these kinds of automatic systems will really like start taking a bite out of, you know, bonds and options and all this other junk that we see in like an e trade? Like, are we going to see e trade offering an amm?
00:07:05.324 - 00:07:12.704, Speaker D: I think they will replace most of most of them, but I'm a little bit amm maximalist.
00:07:16.904 - 00:08:08.066, Speaker C: I'm biased too. I'm with you, Michael. I think, I think, I think the key to get there totally is to figure out scalability and yeah, mass adoption. I think that's like, there's no way we can do that with the current 15 transactions per second and current gas prices that are actually quite like, they're really hurting the small lp's and the small kind of players. So if you do a trade of tens of thousands of dollars, it doesn't hurt you much to pay $20 per transaction. If you're trading or moving $100 worth of crypto, then it's really bad to pay $20. So guys, right, bankers would love it.
00:08:08.090 - 00:08:22.154, Speaker D: By the way, like, you know, minimum viable transaction is a million dollars. Everyone except banks is barred from using, using this stuff because it's too expensive. That's what they want.
00:08:23.094 - 00:08:38.354, Speaker C: Exactly. And I think this is where you guys can play an important role like other l one s as well. There are promising small fees with lots of security. So yeah, I think it's a very important thing that you guys are doing.
00:08:40.894 - 00:09:08.654, Speaker A: I mean, like we can toot our own horn, but I think the space is really transforming from proof of work networks, where block space is a scarce commodity, to proof of stake networks where block space is plentiful. And you're not going to have this kind of like supply constraint problems anymore. Even that. Even. I think our solution is the best lowest latency. It's going to have the best performance. But I think at the end of the day, all proof of stake networks kind of solve this problem.
00:09:08.654 - 00:09:13.826, Speaker A: So to me, sorry, I was just.
00:09:13.850 - 00:09:44.080, Speaker C: Curious, don't you think that kind of data size or blockchain size matters a lot for decentralization? So it's not much the problem of like proof of work being costly to like, you have to spend a lot of energy to mine blocks. It's more like how decentralized you can be with availability of the state of the blockchain and how fast it grows. Yeah.
00:09:44.112 - 00:10:30.540, Speaker A: So separating those two problems, there is the larger size and the state itself. And in proof of stake networks, Vitalik's famous post on weak subjectivity basically kind of put the nail in the head for that kind of. It forced the proof of stake development to go into a certain direction where you assume that the network is live for some period of time. ETH two is targeting 90 days, but those timescales can be much shorter. The only history that the network cares about from a security perspective is the last 90 days or some amount of time. That's the slashing period. The network cannot use information prior to that period, so it's meaningless.
00:10:30.540 - 00:11:25.986, Speaker A: And from that perspective, you can store that data in some really cheap redundant storage. For example, we're using Arweave, they've solved the data persistent data storage problem. Why do we need to solve it? We just dump our data set there and then this isn't running yet. The only thing that you need is how do I verify that this data is accurate? And RSA accumulators are a really good solution to that. But there's other techniques that can accumulate state into small proofs, like Merkel proof is the traditional one. It's a different network, different security parameters. And the main difference there is that something like Ethereum, where you have proof of work, you have guarantees from the electricity that you can deduce was spent to solve this puzzle, that there's certain amount of economic weight to secure this network.
00:11:25.986 - 00:12:17.186, Speaker A: And that is strong objectivity that you just don't have in proof of stake networks. So this is where I think why there's no Ethereum killer. Because Ethereum is a proof of work settlement layer, and that's going to be that layer forever. And I think there's execution engines like Solana, that are super good at a particular use case, and basically pick a Pareto efficient trade off between speed, cost, data size and things like that. The way we've been philosopy is that we're building for price discovery, which means that we need to guarantee that all the state was replicated around the world as fast as possible. So that's what an exchange would want. But there's trade offs there.
00:12:17.186 - 00:12:58.864, Speaker A: Maybe somebody that's building a dag will have it. They have a different point in this Pareto curve. But I think this is a different world for proof of work, and we'll see the universe of networks and use cases move. I think Ethereum will always be this settlement layer, and I think automatic market makers in this slow, secure network, I think, will also function really well. I can't imagine a better platform to launch a project right now than uniswap. You have a bunch of tokens that you want to distribute to a wide range of people. You put them in uniswap with some stablecoin, and all of a sudden you have a market.
00:12:58.864 - 00:13:52.302, Speaker A: You don't really care as a team about the nuance of permanent loss and all this other stuff. You just want to just, you just want distribution. So, like, that's kind of like, my theory is that, like, Ethereum killed the Binance IeO, like totally, like, which is awesome. Which is, I think is like, couldn't have been a better outcome. So that's kind of like, I think our job, I hope, Solanas, is to take a chunk out of binance's, like, daily volume, like, actually provide a, you know, censorship resistant open platform for people to have these, like, sophisticated spot markets and dynamic market makers and for anybody, like, you know, ave to plug into this. But also, like, I don't want to. This isn't about pitching, Solana.
00:13:52.302 - 00:14:28.834, Speaker A: So, like, I kind of want to give the conversation back to you guys. What I was blown away by these algorithmic solutions is that they're passive. And Fernando, like you said, ETF's charge people for this privilege to give up money so that they can balance the portfolio. And here, this is done for you. So this was, to me, what turns the traditional finance on its HUD is that this little bit of code basically gets rid of thousands of teams at all these banks trying to repackage this into a product where they can charge fees.
00:14:29.594 - 00:15:12.864, Speaker C: And the nicest thing totally, just to agree on you there, is that it just wasn't possible in the conventional world. Like, you need a custodial, like a place to do the custody, you need a place for exchange, and you need all the regulators and all the licenses. It's like a million different pieces put together. And all of that has to be paid, right? The system has to be paid. And that's why you can't get around a fees for index funds, for conventional index funds like Robin Hood, I think they don't charge any, but they have, like hidden fees. So it's somehow you have to pay for that, right? And the beauty of smart contracts is that, like, it's all in one place without any intermediaries. And it's trustless.
00:15:12.864 - 00:15:48.858, Speaker C: It's beautiful. And I think that the most disruptive things that appear when you have like revolutionary technologies are things that were not possible before. So we're not, as I say, we're not just repackaging existing things into the blockchain, it's just things that could not exist that I think people will slowly realize how much superior they are. And in order for that to happen, we need just like better ux, better scalability, lower costs for transactions, and all those things we know we need to work on as a space together. Yeah.
00:15:48.906 - 00:16:51.594, Speaker E: Also I think that like 24/7 availability and transparency are also two huge advantages that like blockchain based economic systems like Ave as a lending protocol balancer or curve for units, what they have compared to centralized finance. Because like a simple example, I need, I need my money. 11:00 p.m. In the evening, the bank will not be available to give you your money. But if you are actually using a decentralized protocol, then you can see at any point in time, and in a completely transparent way, what is happening, where your money is, how is being used, and depending on the kind of protocol, more or less, you have 100% availability of your liquidity at any point in time. Huge advantages. Just like the traditional financial system.
00:16:52.614 - 00:17:52.484, Speaker D: Yeah. By the way, they just kind of thought about like having different small users versus, versus slow and not very scalable, but very secure Ethereum blockchain is that it's probably possible to have these liquidity pool tokens of what is on Ethereum bridged to Solana, so that people can buy small pieces of those. And you know, if, even if the pool which earns, which earns money stays on Ethereum, even when it's expensive, you can buy a penny of that on Solana. And that kind of pool on Solana, pool of Elp token on Solana can be arbitraged with the one on Ethereum. And that like, even if market making is not on Solana, you could use it to scale to smaller users.
00:17:56.144 - 00:17:57.352, Speaker C: Very good idea.
00:17:57.528 - 00:18:38.294, Speaker A: Yeah, that, to me, I think is pretty exciting too. We helped on the contract side with the serum folks and they built out a very, very simple market maker, amm. And what was surprising to me, how quickly passive income users want passive income. They want continuous, simple passive income. How quickly they just funneled money into this thing. I think this is one of these products that I think could break out into the real world. If we can teach, you know, regular humans how to deal with private keys.
00:18:42.594 - 00:19:36.234, Speaker C: I was just going to say that what Emilio said, and it circles back to what you're saying. Tolly Emilio touched on the transparency and how like available like 24/7 your money is and you can track it and that brings. It has like the flip side of the coin, which is privacy and somehow security. So if people can easily know, like, who owns $100,000 and you spend it and people know, okay, it's you who owns that, you who own that, it can be very bad. So it kind of circles back to what you said, like holding a private key to something that is completely transparent. If that private key can be matched or connected to you, then you have problems, especially in countries where criminality is a problem. So, yeah, I think another important thing that we need to solve is privacy.
00:19:36.234 - 00:19:47.034, Speaker C: And that comes many times together with scalability because it's just more computationally intensive. Anyways, just wanted to point that out.
00:19:49.134 - 00:20:10.624, Speaker D: Yeah, that actually would be a little bit challenging with regulators because they seem to be a little bit irritated by all the privacy technologies and they somehow think it's like terrorists will use that. Well, terrorists right now use a very private coin called us dollar.
00:20:13.084 - 00:20:24.064, Speaker C: Yeah. Private coin is the banknote itself. Right. No one knows who holds it. It's completely. Yeah. Kind of in stealth mode.
00:20:26.324 - 00:21:09.234, Speaker A: Yeah. That is like, I think, I personally think that regulators are mostly on our side because the systems we're building are fraud proof that are transparent. There's an. At the end of the day, I think like most of the teams in the space are trying to build something where nobody can get screwed. And I think those systems are what regulators want anyways, that they actually want some guarantees about. So I am hopeful and optimistic about where the space is going, I guess. Do you guys, what is your take, I guess from your point of view on how regulation is going to affect the space?
00:21:15.354 - 00:23:09.194, Speaker E: You know, I have this perspective that at some point, like, there will be some kind of hard regulation coming in. The hard in the sense that would be some maybe specific enforcements to team working on blockchain or requirements to meet for people. I mean, on the. On the contracts itself, on the protocols, on the underlying protocols, you can really, as an entity, like a regulation entity or whatever, you can really do much, right? I mean, the protocol is on a network that is censorship resistant and there isn't much to do. What can you do? Probably is more like on entities that are well known that actually build into space, maybe like require, enforce kind of some specific requirements or, I don't know, like require to meet some specific guidelines to provide a certain kind of services, which in my opinion, depending on the specific, like, flavor of these, like, requirements or guidelines or enforcements, I might agree with. I mean, personally, I like to build protocols and services that people can use, everybody can use, but I would not like to facilitate money laundering or bad people taking advantage of this decentralized protocol to push their business forward. I'm all for regulation as long as it doesn't, like, kind of slow down research and development.
00:23:09.194 - 00:23:28.154, Speaker E: So this is my personal point of view on the topic. If regulation is to come, I hope that it will come. Like, by respecting people that is building and that is trying to create something that is new and not actually trying to choke the space in something that is not essentially.
00:23:28.494 - 00:23:28.846, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:28.870 - 00:24:10.576, Speaker D: Well, I mean, yeah. Yes, you are right that regulation probably wouldn't be able to affect protocols which are already working. So in this sense, right now is a good time to launch protocols. But, yeah, if regulation comes hard on those who build, what we will witness is many anonymous launches. I guess so. Like, I mean, I don't know if, like, probably, like, if it goes a little bit hard, it will go out of their control. So they probably don't want to be too hard.
00:24:10.576 - 00:24:46.678, Speaker D: And they. Well, also depends on, like, what. What do they want to achieve? If regulation. If regulation comes as something which legitimizes the project in view of people, so that, you know, being. If being regulated will be a marketing thing, maybe that will work. But if regulations will be, oh, you know, enforcement comes, so everyone be scared, then I think it just might go away from the control. And I don't know if it's good or not.
00:24:46.678 - 00:24:55.422, Speaker D: So, yeah, I guess I hope they will kind of smartly adapt to this space.
00:24:55.478 - 00:25:43.690, Speaker C: Really. I agree totally with you, Michael. I think that they are, like, in essence, I think regulators are good people, well intended, and they want to avoid people being defrauded. Right. So they have, like, as you said, tilly, we're building things that make it easier for them, for everyone to know that people cannot be screwed or rug pulled at any moment, like banks can just do, because there's no transparency. And more and more people having bitcoin on their balance sheets, companies and paypal kind of embracing crypto, I think this is going to be happening more and more. And at some point, it will be just impossible for regulators to say that, let's crack down on bitcoin.
00:25:43.690 - 00:25:46.374, Speaker C: Let's crack down on Ethereum or Defi. Right.
00:25:46.674 - 00:25:49.494, Speaker D: They already cannot crack down on bitcoin. Really?
00:25:49.914 - 00:26:08.294, Speaker C: They can't yeah, they know they would miserably fail if they tried to, so they're not going to try. And as time goes by, like the defies and the ethereums, the Solanas of the world, they will start to get like a bitcoin level non stopness.
00:26:08.674 - 00:26:15.614, Speaker D: Yeah, it takes ten times China would ban defi to make it resilient.
00:26:21.554 - 00:27:03.444, Speaker A: Do you guys see? So I kind of saw the space really quickly mature in the sense that you take a simple idea like Amam, and then people started really optimizing them towards different, different, totally different use cases. That kind of innovation is always inspiring to me. What do you guys see in the next midterm of coming out with algorithmic continuous products? I don't know what to call them. Amms, I think, is the umbrella term for all of this stuff, but I think any kind of automatic math that runs on chain, I think, can fall under that.
00:27:08.324 - 00:27:44.008, Speaker D: Yeah. Well, I guess our amm space is not. Is not actually discovery space is not yet fully explored. I feel there is a lot more to get there right now. Well, at least to be frankly speaking, either balancer mm or uniswap mm are not yet kind of fully competitive with binance. Right. I mean, yes, they are great for, like, use case, like launching a new token because you have no idea what the price will be.
00:27:44.008 - 00:28:12.808, Speaker D: So let's say when wifey launched on. Pretty much launched on balancer, right. It was using this non 50 50 pool feature. That's great. And it worked very well. So it launched and probably better than what it would have been on centralized exchanges. You don't need market makers who you would pay and so on.
00:28:12.808 - 00:28:48.982, Speaker D: That's great. So this niche, I think, is very well served by current crypto emms, but kind of beyond that, let's say bitcoin to USD market, for example, I think that for the same amount of liquidity, well, for the same amount of deposits in access of an exchange of a market maker, I think centralized exchanges are at the moment more efficient and, yeah, I guess Anatoly could very well say about that.
00:28:49.038 - 00:28:49.634, Speaker C: Right?
00:28:50.294 - 00:28:58.814, Speaker A: Like, you know, we're getting closer, if you like. If you look at serum spreads, they're getting closer to what you see on binance. Right?
00:28:58.974 - 00:29:17.114, Speaker D: Yeah, but that's like order books. So order books as a concept are at the moment more efficient for cryptos, at least for established cryptos. For newly launched cryptos, it could be a different story. But for, like, something which is already. Which exists for at least a couple of weeks.
00:29:19.254 - 00:29:20.074, Speaker A: Yep.
00:29:21.454 - 00:29:25.034, Speaker D: Then, yeah, that's already established crypto. Right.
00:29:27.054 - 00:30:01.460, Speaker C: I agree with you, Mike, and I think that something I'm personally excited about and I think is missing a lot today in amms. In amms in general, is more like adaptiveness, if that word even exists. Like more intelligence to react to market conditions. Like balancer is already, in my opinion, a great improvement on uniswap because it's just more flexible. And of course, there's trade offs. It's more complex, and UX is a bit harder. So it's trade offs everywhere, but you can choose like a 2% fee.
00:30:01.460 - 00:30:47.212, Speaker C: And Michael, what you said about Wi Fi, they had like, 2% in their pools, or I think 1%. They made a lot of money, like early LP's in those pools, made a lot of money from traders. And that type of flexibility is great, but actually what you want is something. And today, I like to use the analogy, today we're using taxes only because you have a fixed fee, like a taxi, you pay like the same whatever kilometer you drive. But what we need is Uber. We need the liquidity pools to be automatically adapting their prices, their fees to the market conditions. So if you think of black Thursday or any time where, like, people want to trade and they're willing to pay more, right.
00:30:47.212 - 00:31:12.340, Speaker C: And that's, like, good for both sides, you increase the. You decrease the slippage because you have more. More liquidity because the pool is more profitable. So you track more lp's, and then when times are calmer, then the pool goes down with a fee to allow for traders to. So it. That sort of intelligence is something that I think is missing. And we're getting there, right? Yeah.
00:31:12.412 - 00:32:07.886, Speaker D: I think one good attempt is money swap by one inch. Well, in a way, fee is just a spread, right. And what they do when some trade happens, like, if you draw graphically and market depth of what amm does, it basically looks like, I don't know, like this, right? Some spread open here. So what they do when the trade happens, one side moves like this and then the other side slowly moves there. So basically, if the demand is high, then you have this spread higher, which automatically means the same as p being higher and amm working more. Like amm earning more. But I don't know if it, like, always works well, because, like, you, maybe some model could be a little bit different.
00:32:07.886 - 00:32:50.504, Speaker D: Because, like, I'm seeing that some pools there are earning a lot, so it works, but some other pools are not. So, for example, for, you know, pool with crv earns more on uniswap and balancer than muniswap. I don't know why that's kind of, there are probably different regimes and like, like, it's a little bit understudied. And really all this world of Amms is not yet kind of fully explored as we're just starting. And it kind of requires more research, I would say both experimental and mathematical on simulations and everything.
00:32:51.324 - 00:33:41.014, Speaker A: So one quick show is that running a central limit order book in the same state machine as the Amm allows you to kind of use that information atomically and without a need of oracle. So you actually have effectively the book which is computed by Alameda and jump and the folks market making there with real skin in the game, when they create the spread, they do it based on real prices and the risks that they're taking. So you can effectively like steal that information. And what I think is really cool about this is that this becomes actually beneficial for both sides because now there's more depth in the market from the passive LP's. And that to me is like kind of like everybody's kind of working together, like, in that.
00:33:41.054 - 00:33:45.274, Speaker D: Speaking about using this information on Solana, are there flash loans on Solana?
00:33:46.734 - 00:34:03.862, Speaker A: You could, I mean, like, this would be up to the lending protocol. So we're not, we're not there yet, but to flash loans would be a way to, you'd have to, when you build this, you would have to design it to be flash flow and resistant. So you kind of need like a bit of, you know, an integrator. Right over.
00:34:03.918 - 00:34:24.593, Speaker E: Even worse is now becoming so like WBTC is thinking of implementing this flash minting feature. Dai is thinking of implementing feature. I'm a little bit scared, to be honest, because it's like flash launch on steroids where you can essentially mint infinite money. But we will see how it.
00:34:24.733 - 00:34:39.893, Speaker D: Yeah, I think maybe it's okay if governors can decide what is the upper limit, which can be flash minted, because if you, when you can mint two to the power 255 coins, you can break a lot of things.
00:34:41.393 - 00:34:45.049, Speaker A: Yeah, we're getting into numerical stability problems.
00:34:45.161 - 00:34:46.213, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:34:46.713 - 00:34:48.945, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:34:49.129 - 00:35:56.344, Speaker E: If you can pick up on the previous topic of like aspects where I'm excited, what I'm excited about in the upcoming future. It's funny because I listened to Fernando and Michael and they have this mindset of how can we swap and we can be more efficient. When I think about amms and what they are, I think, okay, we get shares in exchange, how we can reuse them in a more efficient way. It's more like building lending protocols where people can actually collateralize multiple kind of assets. Like for me, it becomes very natural to think as AMM shares are assets that are very, very powerful collaterals. For example, Fernando was talking about the fact that balancer is essentially automatic rebalancing index or fund or whatever we want to call it. In the upcoming.
00:35:56.344 - 00:36:45.206, Speaker E: As Aave. In the upcoming months, we will experiment a lot with AMM shares, specifically with balancer shares. Shortly we will come up, we will propose actually to the governance to bootstrap, a component of the ecosystem that is called safety module. Right now is allowing to stake Abe. Shortly we will create a proposal to the governors to actually stake also bouncer shares with a ratio of ABE NDTH. We will also will be incentivized and contribute to kind of work as an insurance, last minute insurance for the protocol in case. In the case of collateralization.
00:36:45.206 - 00:37:25.780, Speaker E: Another aspect that I find very, very interesting is using those shares as a collateral in the markets themselves. So people can, I don't know, depositing curve or depositing balancer, and use those shares as collateral. So they keep exposure to these automatic rebalancing indexes and at the same time earn the fees. And at the same time, they can have more capital efficiency by borrowing against them. And I think in the upcoming months there will be especially on. For us, for Aave we have version two. Aave version two coming very, very soon.
00:37:25.780 - 00:38:09.734, Speaker E: And there are a lot of changes in Aave version two that like we will make kind of borrowing against this kind of assets very, very easily, very, very easy and also very, very fluid. You will be able to borrow against them and eventually exchange them under the hood. Or move between different positions, like very similar. So I'm really, really excited. And there is also another aspect like is the integration of interest yielding assets, like lending asset. That is an asset that has been lended out on lending protocols like AAvE. And use those in AMM.
00:38:09.734 - 00:39:04.344, Speaker E: I mean, right now, for example, some pools of curve they under the hood deposit in Wyvern that also deposits in Abe. There are some wire strategies that like the YA link that deposits in Abe under the hood. And then uses the link to borrow in Aave to yield farm with the borrowing funds. So there is already some integration on these specific assets, of using yield assets underneath and reusing them on AMM and vice versa. From the AMM tech defiance and deposit in Yale generating protocol like Abe. And I think in the upcoming months, there will be a lot of more. There will be more research and more innovative integration on the field.
00:39:07.164 - 00:39:48.594, Speaker A: I think this recursive lending. You get AMm tokens back and then you put them into Aave, and then you get Dai to go buy it. I think this is exactly what is done with a big pile of paper and inscrutable business deals in real finance. And like, having it actually on chain would allow us to like do some Monte Carlo simulations and see what the actual risks are. I think ultimately this is actually building a more robust financial system because this is now like open and like, you know, not easy to understand, but understandable by engineers.
00:39:48.714 - 00:39:49.378, Speaker C: Auditable.
00:39:49.466 - 00:39:50.654, Speaker A: Right, exactly.
00:39:51.954 - 00:40:41.940, Speaker E: You know, also we need to consider that some. For example, I consider a dai EDH balancer share, for example, to be a safer, from a protocol perspective, to be a safer collateral than only ETH, because there is, you know, this automatic rebalancing under the price of the share itself will always respect the ratio, the price between ETH and dai, which means that it's way harder to liquidate a loan that is created against a share like this and against ETH by itself. So from a protocol perspective, but also from a user perspective, use these kind of shares as a collateral to borrow is safer than using a plain ETH, for example. And this is true for many assets.
00:40:42.052 - 00:41:12.566, Speaker D: Also, this thing kind of creates a market for itself. Like, if you have, I don't know, maybe, maybe not with uniswap, but with balancer, yes. If you have a pool, let's say ETH, ETH dai. Right. And let's say you are to liquidate this color, this LP share. You could, could do one sided withdrawal for that, I guess. Just withdraw, die instead of selling.
00:41:12.566 - 00:41:14.034, Speaker D: Like, why not?
00:41:26.484 - 00:41:41.116, Speaker A: I think, like, what I'm scared of is like the compounding technical risk of a single numerical. Like that is true when I say.
00:41:41.220 - 00:42:01.236, Speaker E: Less risky from a liquidity perspective, not from a technician risk, because of course there is like more compounding, like risk from a smart contract perspective and from a whole system perspective, but from a liquidity perspective is safer. But then there is this whole aspect.
00:42:01.260 - 00:42:11.572, Speaker A: That is another story I'm very thankful for. Rust's checked math that all the operations can basically check for overflow by default.
00:42:11.748 - 00:42:14.496, Speaker D: Yeah, same with wiper.
00:42:14.660 - 00:42:21.504, Speaker E: We are getting it in solidity 0.8. We will get automatic automated, like arithmetic.
00:42:21.544 - 00:42:24.256, Speaker D: Operation check safe math by default.
00:42:24.320 - 00:42:24.784, Speaker C: Right?
00:42:24.904 - 00:42:31.040, Speaker D: Yeah, finally. It should have been there from the beginning.
00:42:31.192 - 00:42:35.288, Speaker A: Bits is good enough for everybody, right? Yeah.
00:42:35.336 - 00:42:48.284, Speaker D: Yes. Oh, yeah. We're, of course, also on ethereum, we have 24 smart contract size limit, but yeah, for now it's enough for everyone. Of course, always will be.
00:42:54.064 - 00:42:54.416, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:54.440 - 00:43:33.354, Speaker A: If you want bigger. Bigger contracts and more math, you can use Solana. So I think in some ways, like rust, bigint is 128 bits, and you always have to think about overflow because you're multiplying 64 bit values. So it's kind of like, I think in some ways you're less, if you're like an engineer that is careful about this stuff, you're less likely to make mistakes because you always have to think about them. I find constraints to be where art can be created. If you have too many options, you often don't know what to do.
00:43:37.274 - 00:43:38.626, Speaker C: Is there like safe math?
00:43:38.690 - 00:43:39.786, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:39.890 - 00:43:44.306, Speaker C: It's linear, like built in, so you don't need to. It's just rust.
00:43:44.450 - 00:43:53.898, Speaker A: Right. So you, like, you use rust. The rust libraries which have checked save math operations just compiles in the check in, right?
00:43:53.946 - 00:43:55.722, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Same with Viper, by the way.
00:43:55.778 - 00:43:56.814, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:43:58.314 - 00:44:45.124, Speaker A: You could, like, at the hardware level, you could basically check for overflow and every operation. But that's, yeah, that's not, I think that that may have unintended consequences that have, like for libraries, they don't expect that they actually expect values to overflow, you know, because they're stupid c tricks all the way down. At the end of the day, I guess this is from maybe a question for folks that are listening, that are developing. What is your typical verification audit process? How do you guys go from idea to actually getting something in Maine.
00:44:47.584 - 00:44:47.984, Speaker C: Alt.
00:44:48.024 - 00:44:53.924, Speaker A: Account on Twitter and yolo it and see what happens?
00:44:54.324 - 00:46:10.268, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess for us it's more like, well, need to get a very good test coverage first. That's the must, like, everything should be in automated tests and the unit tests, integration tests. And also we have, like, more recently we introduce stateful testing, which is, well, kind of a little bit like pretty much fuzzing where you discover like, what parameters can break your expectations. And, yeah, of course audits are good. They are necessary, but they are not enough because, like, you know, like with this harvest hack, for example, there were, I think, two audits or something, and still it can happen. So that's, I think it's really up to, up to eventually, up to the developer to get everything really, really well tested. And also we kind of, we don't do much of manual tests on testnets because I think those are probably good for compatibility.
00:46:10.268 - 00:47:03.968, Speaker D: Like when you don't, when you cannot really deploy something, well, deploy something in your test environment yourself. But when you have everything in automated tests, I think you can do more there. And, well, maybe for developing UI testnets are good, but for safety, I think it's more like, it's better to have that automated tests well developed. And, yeah, fuzzing is really a little bit underappreciated in the crypto community, so should be more of that. And hopefully, hopefully, formal verification gets there soon. So we are kind of starting to look into that, although it's a little bit early, but I think it's coming. So also not bulletproof.
00:47:03.968 - 00:47:49.178, Speaker D: Like, when you have formal verification, it's more like. More like super tests. Like, more like fuzzing, which can explore all the parameter space completely, but if you don't come up with a good spec, you kind of don't get it, so. But, yeah, and also we have monitoring, like seeing or looking for something with some bad things to happen. Like, for example, we have the invariant. Well, I mean, every Mm has an invariant, right, which. And you can define a specific invariant invariant per LP token, which must not go down.
00:47:49.178 - 00:48:14.020, Speaker D: And we just set up monitors to see if it ever goes down. And, like, you could catch, like, these things. Well, we did catch something like that in, like, pool, which we deployed and started testing ourselves. So let's say you trade something and you don't see anything suspicious. You exchange x coins into y coins.
00:48:14.172 - 00:48:15.144, Speaker C: All good.
00:48:15.724 - 00:48:35.374, Speaker D: But apparently these tests can show, oops, their specific invariant went down. So it's an indication of a loss happening. You start exploring, and, yeah, something is bad. And that's what we check in automated tests as well, so that we, like, chair catch it before deployment.
00:48:38.034 - 00:48:38.794, Speaker A: Was that at all?
00:48:38.834 - 00:48:40.066, Speaker C: Michael pretty much answered.
00:48:40.170 - 00:48:44.014, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah, I think you covered it.
00:48:45.754 - 00:49:08.530, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Other than the monitoring, which I'm not 100% sure we do, but I think so. Mike McDonald, our CTO, is amazing. So I'm pretty sure he. He thought of that and probably is doing that already. But all the other stuff like fuzzing and coverage and automated testing and those things. Yeah, we do as well.
00:49:08.530 - 00:49:12.730, Speaker C: And, yeah, I agree with you, Michael. And everything you said.
00:49:12.762 - 00:50:12.964, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. On our side is, like, also what Michael said is absolutely, like, relevant in terms of, like, we also aim, like, for 100% test coverage sometimes is really, really tricky, because achieving 100% test coverage sometimes is really tricky. But it's an effort that we do to ensure that whatever we write is safe from a protocol perspective. Also, for V two, we employed formal verification. We worked together with Sartora. Formal verification, like Michael was saying, is really tricky because it's difficult from a technical perspective. Like, for them, it's essentially not possible to formally verify everything because that would lead to extremely complicated properties and invariants.
00:50:12.964 - 00:51:30.132, Speaker E: And more importantly, the protocol needs to be designed for it, because if the protocol is not designed for automatic verification of properties, then it's going to be very, very complicated for them to actually formally verify the protocol. So, advice for the public, when you read that a protocol is fully formally verified, usually is not true, because it means that some parts of the protocol are formally verified. And also for the formal verification, it's very important to aim correctly with the properties, because in the invariance, because if you write the invariants incorrectly, then of course, the whole verification is worthless, essentially. So. But I agree that in some aspects is absolutely fundamental. For example, to test the properties of ERC 20 tokens. We have seen in the past many issues with ERC 20 tokens, like transfer of zero, transfer to yourself, transfer to maybe specific addresses that could bring like multiple types of accounting errors within the contract.
00:51:30.132 - 00:52:55.984, Speaker E: And with formal verification, the ERC 20 is one of the typical example where formal verification is very, very easy to apply and is very, very efficient. We also have, like, I think compared to Amms, we have some further complications that are related to the fact that the state of the protocol changes with time because of the accrual of the interest and everything. So usually you need to, we need to. For example, we brought a specific off chain engine that replicates, essentially it works as a predictor, and after an action that happens on the protocol, then the predictor predicts what should be the state of the protocol, and the tests are run against that predictor and essentially rewrite a lot of different scenarios in a JSON file, for example. And then this JSON file contains all the different scenario that we want to test with time travel and everything, and we ensure that the state of the protocol is consistent with the scenario. And also having these two kind of, these two systems kind of guarantees us that whenever there is an inconsistency that one is giving a result and the other is giving another result, then there is a bug in either in one or the other. So we have this kind of two side validation of the results that we expect.
00:52:55.984 - 00:54:05.054, Speaker E: Also, I agree also with Michael when he said that audits are important, but the audits only tell one side of the story. Story, really, they don't tell you everything, because like, of course, we cannot expect auditors to have 100% full understanding. I mean, it would take a lot of, usually you see maybe audits or three, four weeks for two auditors. If the protocol is complex, I can guarantee you that they are not going to understand fully the protocol in four weeks because it's really complicated to understand all the edge cases. So audits are very, very important, but they only tell one side of the story. What is important is also that the developer team puts enough effort in reviewing and validating their code that they wrote, because audits will not save you from potential hacks or abuses we have seen already multiple times. And it's not fault of the auditors, to be honest, I don't blame the auditors when this happens because it's not their fault.
00:54:05.054 - 00:54:21.094, Speaker E: And in general, software have bugs. I mean, we cannot think that there are no bugs. It's almost impossible. I mean, unless it's something very, very simple. In general, complex software systems, they have bugs. I mean, you cannot.
00:54:22.274 - 00:54:34.814, Speaker A: Multipliers and hardware had bugs. You know, like intel had like a floating point division bug, right. That basically bricked one of their Pentium lines.
00:54:34.974 - 00:54:35.438, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:35.526 - 00:54:45.118, Speaker E: Even worse, the last one, the meltdown and then the specter where you can actually read the state of the privileged memory. That was the worst one.
00:54:45.206 - 00:55:05.064, Speaker A: Well, that is a complicated thing, because it involves caching and context switching and privilege switching. Privilege that's basically impossible to get. Right. They should rename their SGX to something from trust zone to like possibly trusted zone.
00:55:06.844 - 00:55:07.284, Speaker C: Maybe.
00:55:07.324 - 00:55:08.076, Speaker E: Trust.
00:55:08.260 - 00:55:40.534, Speaker A: Yeah, quantum zone, you may or may not trust the state of the system. There's some interesting, some questions that might be fun to answer. So with the issue of impermanent loss, how do you think we'll continue to incentivize liquidity providers to maintain reserve pools? What's your view on this? I think you guys have totally different projects and different solutions to this space. I'm curious to hear.
00:55:43.194 - 00:56:23.854, Speaker C: Maybe I'll just go first because I have to. Unfortunately, I have a hard stop now, but I think that, and I think Michael agrees with me. We discussed this on other channels already. It's just inherent to providing liquidity that since you're selling something as it goes up, if it ends up being a lot higher, then you sold it for less. So if you compare it with the final state, of course you lost money compared to holding that. Really, there's no magic in like, there's no way to prevent or to stop impairment loss altogether. It's just, it's a consequence of like, market making.
00:56:23.854 - 00:57:09.326, Speaker C: And sometimes you want to reduce exposure on something that keep going, keeps going up. And it's just like. Yeah, your, your intention when you provide liquidity should be to rebalance. And there's different ways to kind of mitigate the loss that you have if you really see that as a loss, for example, increasing the fees when there's more volatility, making sure that you have correlated assets, which is something that curve does very well. So I'm sure there's going to be other interesting solutions in the future that people will come up with. So it's an ever kind of evolving problem. But I just think there's no, like, silver bullet.
00:57:09.326 - 00:57:32.186, Speaker C: It's just trade offs that people come up with. And whenever someone says, we solved impermanent loss, I immediately get very worried and don't really believe them. Yeah, guys, it was really fun. Thanks for inviting us on the total end. Michael, Emilio, great talking to you. Talk to you soon. Bye.
00:57:32.310 - 00:57:33.626, Speaker A: Yeah, take care.
00:57:33.810 - 00:57:35.374, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Bye bye.
00:57:44.394 - 00:57:45.010, Speaker A: Cool.
00:57:45.122 - 00:58:02.914, Speaker B: I think, I think with that, we're just, just about done. I think we're wrapping up right on time, which is a first for these panels. So well done, everyone. Amelia, it was great to have you join us. We really love everything Ave is doing. Congratulations on all the recent news. Decentralization.
00:58:02.914 - 00:58:15.974, Speaker B: Michael, you've been a pleasure joining all these panels as well. So thank you so much. Thank you so much for your time. And anatoly, amazing job as always, hosting these. This was a really, really great discussion, and I think we kind of took a deep dive into all different aspects of liquidity pool.
