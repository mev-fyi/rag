00:00:01.520 - 00:00:26.014, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Hello. Hello. There is maybe something ironic about being on stage at 420 in Amsterdam. I'm not going to make that joke, but you can figure it out yourself. What's up, guys? My name's George, I'm from step finance and we're going to be talking about the chain. We're going to be checking the chain, bro. Perhaps a brief interlude from all of the dev focused discussions recently.
00:00:26.014 - 00:00:49.718, Speaker A: I'm not going to tell you how to dev, but I am going to inform you about reality. If I thought that there were rocks in the sky, perhaps I would live my life differently. So I need to align myself with reality that there's not rocks in the sky. And the same is true for blockchains. We're going to have to look at the actual data and what's behind it. So let's get into it. It's going to be a brief sort of overview of a lot of different things going on, but I hope it's exciting.
00:00:49.718 - 00:01:26.376, Speaker A: And if you have any questions, definitely come on through after. But this is sort of the overview slide, right? So, 300k daily active addresses, some of these metrics. One of the things I would implore you to do if you're building your apps is ensure that you use words correctly. So what is an active address? Perhaps it's a fee paying address. So I would keep that in mind when a lot of people would say a daily active user is a fee paying address. I perhaps would disagree, but some people will include that. So I would say some of these metrics we're going to get into a little bit more.
00:01:26.376 - 00:02:01.674, Speaker A: We've got Dex volume, the number of transactions per an address, and essentially cNFts we can talk about a little bit. How do they compare with all of the crazy stuff going on in defi. But that's the sort of brief overview. Now, this number, TVL. TVL can be influenced, of course, by number going up, and number has been going up recently. So actually TVL, when measured in USD, goes up. Does that mean that more people are depositing into your protocol or whatever you're doing? Maybe, maybe not.
00:02:01.674 - 00:02:37.496, Speaker A: So I would keep this with a grain of salt, this 75% number, but ultimately it's good. We're going to talk a little bit about perhaps there's better metrics than TVL. I think TVL, some people might agree it's a bit of a meme, but number going up is always good to see. This is over a twelve month time period and is including liquid stake tokens as well for a lot of that. So Defi growth. Defi has been doing quite well of late. In fact, we've seen a lot of projects tokenizing and maybe it's token season, so that'll be very exciting.
00:02:37.496 - 00:03:02.464, Speaker A: But also number going up drift. Doing a great job there. Eleven x. Great to see Jito as well. The numbers for Jito, I'm pretty sure are inaccurate because every time I updated this presentation the number was up 10%. So your mileage may vary with that number, but almost 5 million sol, I think. In fact, I think maybe 5 million Sol is being hit today, maybe yesterday, something like that.
00:03:02.464 - 00:03:44.088, Speaker A: But good to see growth in Defi, mainly in projects that are sort of trading related exchanges, these sorts of things. Now, stablecoin supply, stablecoins are a great thing. In fact, I think Anna from the foundation might like this slide. But essentially we took a look at all the different blockchains and how stablecoin growth has changed over the last twelve months. So we've got a comparative here for Solana versus some of the other active fast chains and so on. The stablecoin supply, you would expect in a bear market to go down, and it has, but it's gone down less on Solana than elsewhere. Now what could this indicate? I don't know.
00:03:44.088 - 00:04:15.974, Speaker A: It's up to you to decide what it can indicate. It could indicate many things, but ultimately more stablecoins are staying in active supply on Solana, which is great to see. Ultimately more stablecoin growth on Solana. Solana also has a proclivity for USDC as well, instead of USDT, which is perhaps more popular on other chains. So also keep that in mind. But 17% difference over the last year, I mean, that's pretty good in a bear market when tokens are -95% all over the place. Liquid staking as well.
00:04:15.974 - 00:04:42.468, Speaker A: So liquid staking, I guess, versus native staking in this case, we have the percentage of supply on Solana being quite a lot higher than that of Ethereum. However, the liquid staking total is a lot lower. Now, Ethereum has, Lido is the biggest project. Solana has a whole bunch of different things. You probably see them walking around here as well. But I think these numbers are quite interesting. And the question is, ok, a lot of people are staking.
00:04:42.468 - 00:05:15.174, Speaker A: Perhaps that's some big wallets, perhaps it's exchanges and so on, which actually I think it is. By the way, some of the largest stake accounts, I think is binance and coinbase, unfortunately. And the percentage of liquid stake tokens, I think is the main thing. Right like, I think getting that number up is better. That's more sort of retail, individual focused and so on. So we want to see more of that, the money velocity. This is perhaps one of my most interesting metrics, because I think this is maybe a more of an indicator to the growth of Defi than TVL.
00:05:15.174 - 00:05:44.254, Speaker A: TVL, as I said, bit of a meme. But the velocity of money through protocols is perhaps even more important. So that's kind of the turnover of how many people are swapping the same dollar within the protocol. And we again, compare to other protocols here. Now, looking at these charts, what is the takeaway from this? I guess you could say that Solana being cheaper and pretty fast. Maybe that means that people want to swap more often on Solana than elsewhere. Maybe they're more willing to do that.
00:05:44.254 - 00:06:25.128, Speaker A: Are they putting more transactions to the chain than you would otherwise in other chains? Perhaps that's why the velocity is higher. But ultimately, I think this is a good metric to track. This is a good thing to look at. And if you're out there building an app or whatever that is reliant on defi in some way, I would keep this in mind as you build. So how can you increase the money velocity within your protocol? Are there other ways that you can incentivize people to use your protocol more? More usage equals better, no matter what anyone else says. Even though Ethereum people might be like Nabro, that's not the case. So we've also got liquidity pool efficiency, another great metric.
00:06:25.128 - 00:06:58.392, Speaker A: And here we're again comparing Sol and our great friends over at Ethereum. But this one again is the turnover of volume versus the TVL of an LP, specifically orca and radium. So in this case, we're looking at four x, something like that. The turnover is four x higher. Great to see. Again, what does this indicate, this metric? Well, we want to see more people turning over more money. And ultimately a dollar in Solana is much more actively used for liquidity than perhaps a dollar somewhere else.
00:06:58.392 - 00:07:32.754, Speaker A: Now, that, as a statement is also very interesting to see. Does that mean that people use stuff in Solana more? That also means that perhaps a Solana protocol that has four times less TVL than that on Ethereum is equivalent. That could be another way to look at that. So again, I do think the efficiency of how much money can turn over through a protocol is very important. We call this capital efficiency. And certainly with the clmms. CLMm put some extra m's in there, the concentrated liquidity market management pools.
00:07:32.754 - 00:08:16.544, Speaker A: That's both all over Solana at the moment have increased this a lot. And it's quite interesting because often with the concentrated liquidity pools, you have liquidity within a range, whereas previously, years past in Defi world, we had just the XYK Amm when everything was infinite on a line. So essentially it's interesting to see that the concentrated liquidity pools have taken over and they're way more efficient, which is great to see on chain volume. Again, also doing pretty well this number. I caveat it at the start of this presentation that numbers can change. Often numbers can also go up. I think in this case number probably has gone.
00:08:16.544 - 00:08:46.134, Speaker A: We're looking at October there as well. But ultimately I think that through a bear market, we're seeing here some considerate growth, which is great to see. And that will probably continue as more people develop more protocols. We're going to talk about hyperdrive in a moment with the hackathons and all that kind of stuff going on. Maybe these tokenizations of different protocols, like the perp, dexs and so on, will also bring more users. By the way, it usually forexes daily active users when you tokenize. Just throwing it out there.
00:08:46.134 - 00:09:56.564, Speaker A: Ecosystem tokenomics, this is another really good one, right? So I've been shilling this since like two years ago I had a tweet thread on this, and ultimately the fdv ratio is an important thing to track. Now, a lot of people in the past on the Internets and the interwebs have perhaps said that Sol coins are Sam coins, and Sam coins have a high fdv, but is that actually true? So here we take a look again at Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum tokens have been around a lot longer, and essentially, how does the fdvs compare with a lot of those tokens? Now, many of the fdvs of ethereum projects, especially DeFi, are almost fully diluted in that the circulating supply is all out there and there's not too much left in their treasuries or their community pools or whatever. Solana protocols have perhaps have been around a lot less time, often like half the time that they've been around, than Ethereum protocols. Yes, their fdvs are higher, but it's like a 3.3 x, right? So a 3.3 x for fdvs is not a crazy number of SAM is inflating your coins 100,000 billion x, right? Which if you read Twitter, that's what people will say.
00:09:56.564 - 00:10:31.308, Speaker A: But ultimately the fdv ratio is the circulating supply to the total supply. The question is, what is circulating supply. And at step we talk about this quite a lot. We debate what a circulating supply is. I'm open to feedback if you can tell me what a circulating supply is, because often it's an arbitrary metric which you provide coinmarkercap and coingecko, and you're like, this is what the circulating supply is. And they're like, okay, cool, we'll update it. What does that mean? Is there something standardized? Is there something generic that we can use? Some people say that tokens that are locked are not circulating.
00:10:31.308 - 00:11:11.298, Speaker A: Some people say that community pool tokens which might be drawn down at some stage are circulating, but some people say they're not. So there's a lot of sort of problems, I think, in calculating circulating supply, but ultimately we have to put a line in the sand somewhere and decide what a circulating supply is. So ultimately the takeaway from this sole projects, circulating supplies doing quite well, actually 3.3 x, and that number is generally going to trend downwards over time as more tokens get into distribution and circulation, which is great to see. Hackathon Ball market we've also talked about hyperdrive as well. All time highs. Let's go.
00:11:11.298 - 00:11:58.732, Speaker A: 907 projects, probably some people in the audience, I've already met quite a few developers that already been part of that. We came out of a hackathon pretty much most people that I can think of in Solana, different projects, came out of a hackathon at some stage, which is awesome to see. But ultimately 907 projects, I dare say the next hackathon is going to crack a thousand. The metrics are what they are great to see, but also to keep in mind that no other chain has this kind of growth, especially in terms of building projects. Often how do you build a project on another chain? I mean, you kind of tweet about it and then hope that someone cares. Whereas at least with Solana, there is an organized, orchestrated way for people to get involved. So great to see 907 participants.
00:11:58.732 - 00:12:24.436, Speaker A: You can see all of that on the website, and that's going to continue to grow. NFT, Defi. Now, before we spoke about DeFi, DeFi, but with tokens and numbers and stuff, but also that means jpegs. So jpegs, what we're looking at here, we've got the volume. Keep in mind the volumes here at DeFi volume and NFT trading volume as well. 1.1 million sol 0.82
00:12:24.436 - 00:12:56.444, Speaker A: million. It's quite a lot lower than the daily Dex volume that we saw at the start. $37 million a day, something like that. In fact, it's probably like 100 x 500 x lower in some cases if you look at it over a one year time span. So even though we love our JPEg crew, it is also worth keeping in mind. Remember what I said at the start about looking at the chain and seeing what the facts are. A lot more people are using tokens and Defi financialized things rather than perhaps the NFT stuff going on.
00:12:56.444 - 00:13:24.256, Speaker A: But NFT stuff is seeing growth. Great to see. And in fact, most of the NFT lending platforms are not even really a year old. So this has a lot of legs in it yet to run. So that's great to see. Decentralization, another great metric. In fact, yesterday I was at the decentralization panel with all of the other gigachad gigabrains that were there in the validator community, about 2000 validators, something like that.
00:13:24.256 - 00:14:20.684, Speaker A: We're looking to see how we can continue to decentralize that stake, but it's been growing quite rapidly recently. I think one of the challenges for validator stake is perhaps the geographic one, which we can get into in a moment. Also, data centers is another important metric. But to keep in mind, when people are talking about decentralization, I think when we're talking about what is the chain and what does the data say, I mean, this is the data. So over 2000 different validators, you need to try and manipulate at least 33% plus whatever additional percentage on top in order to manipulate anything. So ultimately, the more, the merrier and the more adversarial, the better, and the more geographically distributed the better. Talking about geographic distribution, this is something that we went through recently at step when we moved our validator from east coast us to now Tokyo to become a samurai.
00:14:20.684 - 00:15:09.408, Speaker A: We also have here some of the different countries involved. Ultimately, it wasn't as easy as, hey, can you just put a node in Antarctica and hope it works? Ultimately, Solana being block time is very fast. You can't really communicate with the rest of the network if you're in the middle of nowhere or perhaps not located near other leaders and so on in block production. So ultimately, how the network has to grow is at the fringes and to continue just slowly moving out. And we've seen that recently with more of the US nodes moving to EU and now the EU nodes as well. We've got a lot more people in Tokyo, in fact, over the last few months, so moving more progressively towards Asia. There's a lot more nodes starting up in Singapore, which is great to see, and the number of data centers involved.
00:15:09.408 - 00:15:41.932, Speaker A: I hope to see to grow more. I think there's four major data centers at the moment that are providing quite a lot of the bandwidth and stuff for all of the actual bare metal nodes in the ecosystem. But we want to see that number go higher. And in fact, I think a year ago that number was maybe two major data centers. So we are seeing growth in the geographical stake distribution, which is great to see developer activity. How do you quantify developers? Well, there's more than 75, which is great. So I don't know what Twitter would have to say about that, but we're almost at 1000 now.
00:15:41.932 - 00:16:06.440, Speaker A: What does that actually mean? It means people that are making pull requests to open source repos that are the Solana Foundation. Repos, I think is how a lot of this works. So anyway, you can see all of the people here. We're at the developer stage and there's a lot of us. So always, always good to see. Another thing is community led events. We've also got essentially the first community conference, which is Solana Crossroads.
00:16:06.440 - 00:16:24.404, Speaker A: That was earlier this year in April. What does community conference mean? It means not put on by the foundation. This one here is the foundation. Do a great job. Awesome foundation doing a great job. But ultimately we want to see more community events. Ethereum has, FCC, ETH, Denver, all these different ones.
00:16:24.404 - 00:16:44.730, Speaker A: We want to see more of those with Solana, right. The privatized ones that the community's coming up with that aren't fully backed by the foundation and run by them and so on. So here in Nigeria and Turkey, we've been doing that with the Solana All Stars program. We have over, yeah, I mean, 1500 attendees in Nigeria. It's popping off. It's really awesome. Turkey as well.
00:16:44.730 - 00:17:18.605, Speaker A: Start a little bit later, 613. But ultimately at the moment we have about 1000 people a month, which is about half breakpoint, by the way, that are attending these events. And that's probably going to be 2000 by the end of December, which is also great to see. So more community events, more people interacting with the Solana ecosystem, more gooder key takeaways, resiliency, decentralization, ecosystem growth. I think we've seen all of those things. Keep in mind these metrics when you're building stuff. So I think one of my takeaways is the Defi tokenization versus the NFT lending kind of stuff.
00:17:18.605 - 00:17:49.358, Speaker A: The NFT tokenization or whatever you want to call it, Nft Defi. Perhaps the differential there, quite large stake distribution from validators. Also a very good metric. And yeah, you know, I think there's probably much more takeaways you can get from the chain. But ultimately, you know, I think good news has been happening over the last twelve months, even during the most heinous of bear markets from SPF and all of his friends. So check the chain. It was all good transactions.
00:17:49.358 - 00:18:13.612, Speaker A: Don't vaporize. Unfortunately, bankless crew doesn't have an on off switch. Although I asked Chase yesterday and he said check the GitHub. So maybe I need to check. But ultimately, look, I think we're doing really well and you can always see more of this kind of stuff at stepdatainsights. Check it out. We have newsletters and Twitter and all this kind of thing, but yeah, like and subscribe and that would be great.
00:18:13.612 - 00:18:20.124, Speaker A: So thank you guys. Have a great rest of the day. It's awesome. My name's George. I'll be out there and yeah, have a great rest of the day.
