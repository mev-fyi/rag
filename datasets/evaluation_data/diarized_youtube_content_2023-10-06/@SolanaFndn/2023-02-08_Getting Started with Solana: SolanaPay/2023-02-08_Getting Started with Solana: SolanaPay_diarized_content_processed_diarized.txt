00:00:00.640 - 00:00:13.390, Speaker A: Hello, GM. Welcome to this deep dive episode. Today we're looking at Solana Pay. My name is Colin. I work in the developer relations team at Solana foundation. And today I'm joined by my colleague Callum.
00:00:13.502 - 00:00:20.674, Speaker B: Hey, I'm Callum. I'm the payments deval for payments at Solana Labs.
00:00:21.054 - 00:00:21.886, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:00:22.030 - 00:00:22.302, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:22.318 - 00:00:31.472, Speaker A: So today we're going to be doing a deep dive on Solana Pay. So what's the TLDR? What exactly is Solana Pay and why should people be excited about it?
00:00:31.648 - 00:01:14.474, Speaker B: Yeah, so Solana Pay is basically like a payments and commerce protocol for Solana. So the way I kind of think about it sometimes is often when we connect to it, often when we want to interact with a dapp, we connect our wallet first so that it can ask us to sign transactions. And Solana Pay is kind of a different way to do that, where you can ask someone to sign a transaction without necessarily knowing who they are first. So you can kind of present a transaction for them to view generally in their mobile wallet, and then they can approve it from there.
00:01:15.054 - 00:01:24.482, Speaker A: That's actually quite interesting. And kind of when I just think about how blockchain the technology came about, it was, like, initially built for the payments use case.
00:01:24.618 - 00:01:56.080, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically, because you don't need to connect that wallet first, it opens up these sort of use cases where, you know, you're not having to go into a shop and then, like, connect your wallet, that's like a very flow. So, but then the benefits are generally, you know, the benefits that you get of a Solana transaction. Right. So it's super fast. You know, it's as fast as, as any other payment rails that you can get. The transaction fees are much lower than any sort of alternatives.
00:01:56.080 - 00:02:20.554, Speaker B: Solana transaction fees are very low. You're not dealing with any intermediaries, so it's not like your payments are going through any other parties. There's nothing to deal with there. And you also get the instant settlement as well with Solana transactions. So the money that you're being paid in this payment is available immediately in an account that you control.
00:02:21.414 - 00:03:07.214, Speaker A: That's actually quite interesting. So almost like, kind of provides a direct connection between the merchant and the consumer. And I think also what's kind of. Yeah, and I think what also is quite interesting is I kind of, like, see online where people are like, oh, what's the use case for Solana pay? When we have stuff like Apple Pay, Google pay? But I think some of those people don't realize that even Google Pay or Apple Pay is not actually usable in every region there's some people who don't even have access to bank accounts in the first place. So yeah, it definitely has a ton of use cases and kind of like love the stuff you mentioned about zero transaction fees, instant settlement, no chargebacks. That kind of stuff is incredibly useful.
00:03:08.114 - 00:03:08.450, Speaker B: Yes.
00:03:08.482 - 00:03:18.068, Speaker A: I've also took a look at the Solanapay specification and one thing that definitely stood out to me was the transaction requests. So what can you tell us more about that?
00:03:18.236 - 00:03:44.524, Speaker B: Yeah, so transaction requests are kind of a way to generalize this so that rather than just working for a transfer, so you go into a shop, you pay them, maybe not in Seoul, but you pay them like 100 USDC, let's say transaction requests let you encode any Solana transaction so that you have much more flexibility there. Anything that you can but into a Solana transaction you can use with Solanapay.
00:03:44.684 - 00:03:50.492, Speaker A: Oh, that's quite cool. Would it be possible to see some code and walk through how this works?
00:03:50.628 - 00:04:25.536, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is my index page on the homepage here. We're using a user factor here. Basically what we're doing is we're encoding a URL to an API. So this is a transaction request API. It's just the API checkout. And all I need to do is encode that URL into the QR code here. So yeah, I'll just show you a quick walkthrough of the code that's at this API checkout vote.
00:04:25.536 - 00:05:16.664, Speaker B: So we're going to do a NFT creation here. So the customers come into the store, they're making a payment in USDC and we're going to send them an NFT. So you, you could imagine this being like a loyalty coupon, something like that. Or even they've come into our shoe shop, they've got a pair of trainers and we're going to send them an NFT of that pair of shows so that they can use it in some game or something. So we're going to be using some metaplex stuff here, but I'll just quickly run through that. You basically have two requests that are made. The first one is just a get request which the wallet makes, and that's just going to give, we're just going to return some like the label and icon just so the wallet can sort of show a bit of indication of what they're interacting with there.
00:05:16.664 - 00:05:49.580, Speaker B: But the bulk of it is in this post input here. So basically we're receiving as input here from the wallet, the account, the public key of the user who's scanned it. And that means that we can actually customize this transaction specifically for that user. So in this case, we're going to have instructions where we're sending to metaplex. We want to send this NFT to that user. So I'll kind of just quickly skip through the detail a bit here. But we're doing a NFT create here.
00:05:49.580 - 00:06:38.804, Speaker B: We're passing in the sort of our key pair the account that we're going to be minting it to. We're adding in our instruction where the user is sending, where the buyer here is sending us, the USDC, we just pull that together here. We then sign this transaction as the shop. So as us, because we're going to be sending the NFT, we need to get approval for that. And then we serialize the transaction and return it to the user. And basically the super important thing here is that this transaction is waiting for the user's signature and that's what's going to happen when it's returned to them and they're going to interact with it in their wallet. They'll sign it there.
00:06:39.504 - 00:07:01.158, Speaker A: So that's actually quite interesting because I think, I guess in this use case, we're kind of seeing some more things outside of just a simple transfer. So basically it's like anything that can be. Sorry. Any transaction that can be serialized is a valid transaction for the transaction request.
00:07:01.286 - 00:07:14.174, Speaker B: Yeah. Basically the only limitation here is that it needs to be signed by the user because it's going to be sent, signed by them in that wallet. So anything that you can serialize, you return from that API and it'll work.
00:07:14.334 - 00:08:01.404, Speaker A: That's actually super interesting. So basically, even though it's called Solana Pay, there's so many potential use cases just outside of payments itself. Yeah, because you also have access to the user's wallet address. There's like a lot of like, cool things that you can do in terms of like seeing how many times that particular dress has transacted on the network. What are the stores or what are the things that they've bought to kind of apply a more custom or personalized shopping experience with them, which is actually quite cool. Yeah, because I can also kind of think about, you can do some kind of cross promotion between stores. So, like if you had shopped at that store, then you also get discount at these other stores, which kind of like.
00:08:01.404 - 00:08:14.136, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's just so interesting because then it's like merchants don't have to almost like build a lot of this infrastructure themselves. They already exist. They just kind of need to, like personalize that experience.
00:08:14.320 - 00:08:40.812, Speaker B: Yeah, like, there's some very complex things that, like, you know, large supermarkets and things are already doing. It's very custom, complex way. And I think this sort of lets anyone access that same sort of ability to do things. Like, say, if you've got an NFT, then you get a discount, anything like that. It's all available because you have access to that on the chain activity.
00:08:40.988 - 00:08:47.252, Speaker A: That's so cool. Are there any other cool features you want to see built on top of Solana pay?
00:08:47.388 - 00:09:34.426, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, we were talking outside of payments, I think there's some, like, I'd be really interested to see what else people can think of when you have this ability to, anywhere in the real world, present this request for a transaction. And where else does that make sense? Things like events and tick ting, things like that. I think there's a lot of really cool use cases waiting to be explored there. On the payment side. With merchants in particular, I think a lot has sort of built up around this assumption that money actually takes a really long time to get to the merchant after they're paid. It's going through all sorts of complex systems and things. And with Solana pay, that's not the case.
00:09:34.426 - 00:10:13.738, Speaker B: The money is there immediately, and I'd be interested to see more thinking about what does that actually mean? Like, what happens if that money is there immediately? Can you do more interesting things with pay, payment splitting, and maybe different ways of logging things and having more up to date information? Yeah, I'd be really interested to see more around that. On the consumer side, we kind of touched on this a bit, but I think around loyalty is, I think, really interesting. I think there's a ton of opportunity to do interesting stuff there, and I'd love to see more exploration there.
00:10:13.906 - 00:10:40.734, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think that's actually what, well, one of the many things that actually interests me in the web3, space as a whole, where actually, because of the technology that exists, you can kind of create new experiences that are otherwise impossible or very difficult to do with the traditional systems. And I guess we definitely probably have to touch on saga a little bit. Is there any cool integrations between Solana Pay and Saga to look out for?
00:10:42.494 - 00:11:30.780, Speaker B: I think the big thing here is that every wallet that's in the Dapp store is going to have full support for Solana Pay. So you can rely on this integration with the seed folks and with Solana Pay. So any payments you're making with Solana Pay, you have that integration with the seed felt all the time, you know, I think there's a lot of standardization here where, you know, like, there's already good, good support for Solana pay on sort of a lot, a lot of mobile wallets, but having that seed vault as well, I think makes it. Makes it really interesting. And of course, you can use Solana pay to buy your saga, which is pretty cool.
00:11:30.932 - 00:11:45.826, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely would be doing that. And I guess just finally, before we round off, I kind of saw something around some new features being added, mainly the message sign inspect. Is there any insights? You can shut up on that.
00:11:45.970 - 00:12:37.756, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a sort of. We've got an alpha of this spec on the GitHub at the moment, but it's. Yeah, we're still sort of working for it a little bit. But we're looking to expand Solanapay to also support message signing. So in the same way that if you have a connected wallet in adapt, you can. You can be asked to just sign a message which lets them verify who you are cryptographically without sending a transaction, we want to bring that same ability to Solanapay as well, so that you'd be able to, for example, scan a QR code and verify to some service or some system, sort of who you are. So one example, which I think is quite interesting around this, would be like bi directional communication with a point of sale.
00:12:37.756 - 00:13:11.418, Speaker B: So we've talked about how when you're doing a transaction request, you know who the user is and you can automatically give them a discount based on an NFT or something, but you could also do things like optionally be able to, like sign a message where you're almost logging into the point of sale. And then maybe you get presented with all the different coupons and things, things that you've got seen, and then you could, like, select the coupon and then that's fed into the transaction that's eventually generated. So that would give us a lot. That would give you even more flexibility, I think.
00:13:11.586 - 00:13:31.030, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds incredible. Yeah, definitely would keep an eye on what's happening then, kind of like seeing how that particular spec progresses. But thank you very much, Callum, for joining us on this deep dive episode and definitely keep tabs and seeing what's coming up next with Solana Pave. Thank you for your.
00:13:31.182 - 00:13:31.814, Speaker B: You. Cheers.
