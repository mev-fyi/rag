00:00:03.840 - 00:00:10.478, Speaker A: Hello everyone. GMGM welcome to the Solana Changelog. I'm Nick from the Solana foundation dev rel team and today I've got Jacob with me. How you doing, Jacob?
00:00:10.574 - 00:00:11.854, Speaker B: I'm doing well. How are you doing?
00:00:11.982 - 00:00:16.326, Speaker A: I'm doing amazing. I'm excited for this changelog. Lots of deprecation things.
00:00:16.518 - 00:00:20.446, Speaker B: Yes, there's a lot of different changes going on with what, 2.0, right?
00:00:20.598 - 00:00:40.554, Speaker A: Yep, 2.0. So let's just go ahead and dive into some of these commits. There's I cherry picked a couple of commits to talk about that are about all the deprecation things. Basically anything that's been deprecated for longer than 1.18. Now that we're on 2.0 and higher, all of that deprecated code is going to be. It's currently in the works of being removed.
00:00:40.554 - 00:01:14.380, Speaker A: If you're using any deprecated functions RPC calls syscalls, you need to make sure you're double checking your code to make sure that you are using the new non deprecated functions and calls for those. Steven Lucher also even added a this other commit to add a mergify bot helper to make it so when anything gets deprecated in the future, it gives the PR creator a friendly reminder to make sure that they update the respective clients like the JavaScript client or the rust client. That way we get proper deprecation warnings everywhere.
00:01:14.760 - 00:01:22.756, Speaker B: This is only for people that are upgrading to 2.0. This is going to be removed in 2.0.
00:01:22.928 - 00:01:39.788, Speaker A: Yeah. So after version 2.0 and these commits go live, they'll be removed. But for things like RPC calls where once the clusters, once super majority of the clusters start running these versions, all of those RPC calls and Sysvars and things, they're going to be gone, no longer accessible.
00:01:39.964 - 00:02:11.202, Speaker B: Makes sense. That makes sense. Speaking of 2.0. So a lot of people that are developing with SPL program or something with a on chain, with Solana programs, they might be running into issues right now. And if you've seen this issue being created that I created, there's a lot of different changes that have to happen to some of the different crates to make them properly compatible. There is basically a problem with 2.0 that caused it to be pulled in with all the one x dependencies.
00:02:11.202 - 00:02:22.174, Speaker B: So this is still being worked on. It should be fixed by the time of this video is released, if not like very soon after. You can see right here on the screen, there's just a ton of different.
00:02:22.222 - 00:02:24.342, Speaker A: Merge, ton of working on it.
00:02:24.526 - 00:02:50.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I think John Cinque was basically working on it for a full week and then started trying to get all the last dependencies that he didn't have full control over merge as well. So hopefully it should be merged or should be fixed very soon. But yeah, if you are having trouble with 2.0 there are some workarounds there should be listed in this issue. Definitely check it out and hopefully we'll have the devx better very soon.
00:02:50.326 - 00:02:51.222, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:02:51.326 - 00:03:26.510, Speaker B: In other news, we have another commit that was made by 2501 Babe HaNa this is the stake program. Changes with movestake move lamports. This is specifically the implementation of SIMD 148. So if you're interested in knowing more about what this fully entails, you can go to SIMD 148 and figure out hey, what is the full design of this? Basically too long didn't read moving stake between stake accounts that have the same authority. So definitely check this out. It's a cool change. I'm looking forward to being live at some point on the cluster.
00:03:26.970 - 00:03:32.730, Speaker A: Yeah, same makes things for stake pool operators and users of stake pools a little bit easier, which is nice.
00:03:32.850 - 00:03:33.386, Speaker B: Yep.
00:03:33.498 - 00:04:05.742, Speaker A: And then onto developer resources for the week. Web three JS tech preview number four is out. It's official. So the latest version, latest iteration of the new web3 js is out by the web3 JS team, Steven Lucher and Loris, and all the amazing devs over there. So if you haven't already, take a look at the tech previews, the newest one, give it a try. Figure out like this is your opportunity as a developer in the ecosystem to give like some really good, really good feedback on the things you do and do not like about how this works. Like build something with it.
00:04:05.742 - 00:04:14.756, Speaker A: Give give your shot, share your thoughts, open issues on the GitHub repo and we can make this the new version of web3 js just, just amazingly better.
00:04:14.908 - 00:04:32.956, Speaker B: Yes. And just looking at this, it looks like it has compatibility with the wallet standard, finally. Which was a lot of people's like they were waiting for that to try it out, which makes sense. You need to connect to wallets. So that's cool. Definitely check it out, tell us the problems, make it better.
00:04:33.108 - 00:05:05.420, Speaker A: And then next up here is the Solana request for comments. The srfcs. You can find them all on forum dot solana.com. basically just a public forum for anyone to open, sort of an open dialogue about anything in the Solana ecosystem. There are currently a couple of srfcs that are going around that are pretty much focused on blinks, blinks and actions, which is the new hot thing in the ecosystem. So check out some of these srfcs. If you have ideas for things that could be better, could be changed within the Solana ecosystem, feel free to post your own SRFC.
00:05:05.970 - 00:05:09.170, Speaker B: And speaking about blinks, I think you have a new tool to show us, right?
00:05:09.330 - 00:05:38.000, Speaker A: I do. I've been hard at work on this. So blinks XYz is this new tool that I've been working on. You can find it just blinks XYz and specifically the inspector. So one of the problems that people keep running into is how to make sure that when they're building blinks and actions is how to make sure that it works correctly. You can use the amazing tools that dialect has put together, like dial two. In order to do some of the testing, I built this tool, put it together.
00:05:38.000 - 00:06:09.336, Speaker A: Basically you can enter in your URL of whatever blank URL you're trying to test, and it does a whole bunch of checks on what information is required per the spec in order for your blank in action to actually work. You can see full responses of your action. JSON, you can look at the data that actually gets returned from the get endpoint. You see the URL here. Then you can also test the actual actions that are submitted. In this case, it generates a random wallet. You can actually submit the post request.
00:06:09.336 - 00:06:26.340, Speaker A: You can make sure that you get a valid response, and then you can see the base 64 transaction here. And then you can do whatever you want with that, including if the particular action takes an input. You can also enter in that input right here, directly within the Blinks XYz inspector. Check it out.
00:06:26.790 - 00:06:35.358, Speaker B: Then for people that want to then double check their transaction, can they just put it into the explorer inspector to make sure that it matches what they have?
00:06:35.534 - 00:06:43.942, Speaker A: Absolutely. You can copy and paste this. Go to explorer dot slid.com dot. In fact, I'll probably add a little quick button to just open it directly in the Explorer and make it easy.
00:06:44.086 - 00:06:53.502, Speaker B: That'd be really cool. That way we can verify that it equals what we expected it to equals. Last but not least, we have stack exchange.
00:06:53.606 - 00:06:54.640, Speaker A: Stack exchange.
00:06:54.790 - 00:07:11.092, Speaker B: Um, so we have a bunch of people that looks like some, actually, some newcomers up top. I see child. I haven't seen child up there before. Um, John, of course. Jimmy. Ari Akron is helping out with a lot of the changes. Uh, we have Andre at as Correa.
00:07:11.092 - 00:07:13.780, Speaker B: I don't know, Effie. So it's good to see some new people showing up.
00:07:13.820 - 00:07:14.580, Speaker A: It's nice.
00:07:14.740 - 00:07:28.942, Speaker B: Yeah. Great to see some new people show up on the stack exchange rankings as a gentle reminder like this, helping out the stack exchange and answering people's questions helps out all developers in the ecosystem. We have, what, 20,000 total users?
00:07:28.966 - 00:07:30.190, Speaker A: 20,000 users.
00:07:30.230 - 00:07:46.502, Speaker B: Wow, that is a lot of developers. So we have a lot of people looking for help, and also a lot of people trying to help each other out. So if you've ever tried googling a question or an error that you've had while development and you found stack exchange, that means it's working. Please help out even more, is what I'll say.
00:07:46.646 - 00:07:47.712, Speaker A: Yes, please.
00:07:47.886 - 00:07:54.436, Speaker B: But that's about it. We have for this week's change log, and thank you all for joining us, and we will see you next week. Bye.
