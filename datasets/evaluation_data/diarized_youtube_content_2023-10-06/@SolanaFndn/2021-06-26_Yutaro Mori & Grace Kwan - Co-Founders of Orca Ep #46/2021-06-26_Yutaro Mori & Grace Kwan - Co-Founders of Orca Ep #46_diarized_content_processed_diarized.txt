00:00:12.320 - 00:00:22.886, Speaker A: Folks, this is Anatoly, and you're listening to the Solana podcast. And today I have Ori and Yutaro, co founders of Orca, an Amm dex running on Solana. Welcome.
00:00:22.950 - 00:00:24.510, Speaker B: Thanks so much for having us here.
00:00:24.622 - 00:00:25.690, Speaker C: Hey, Anatoly.
00:00:25.822 - 00:00:33.322, Speaker A: Really cool to have you guys. You guys were like one of the first projects or one of the first founders that we talked to.
00:00:33.378 - 00:00:33.634, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:33.674 - 00:00:39.682, Speaker A: And this was like a crypto decade ago. Yeah.
00:00:39.818 - 00:00:41.762, Speaker B: Had some ups and downs lately.
00:00:41.898 - 00:00:45.962, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think it was like August when we reached out to you.
00:00:46.018 - 00:00:46.394, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:46.474 - 00:01:09.222, Speaker C: Which was definitely. Yeah, it feels like forever ago. Even Solana felt a lot smaller back then. And it was pretty cool that, like, we got to basically just drop a message on discord, and then we ended up talking to you, and, like, I think it was like two or three days, and then we were like, okay, let's do this. Like, let's build a plan, and then let's build on Solana. And here we are.
00:01:09.278 - 00:01:09.646, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:09.710 - 00:01:14.234, Speaker B: Yeah. Even only being here officially since March, it's been kind of a wild ride.
00:01:15.094 - 00:01:15.614, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:15.694 - 00:01:28.556, Speaker A: You guys always had, like, a really cool and different vision for Dexs and things like that, which was more user friendly and kind of more fun. Can you dive into that and tell us about it?
00:01:28.660 - 00:02:17.792, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So I think people have been talking forever about how DeFi is going to become the next Internet economy and money, Legos and all that. But I think in order for that to be true, we really do need to get way more users onto DeFi. And obviously, the way to do that is to make it more accessible. And so just looking at the two of us and the skills that we bring to the table, like, Yutaro's deep experience with blockchain and with Ethereum, and then me having basically built my career around making really complex technical products really user friendly, I think we just saw a huge opportunity to make an amm, something that people could really use to quickly appreciate, like, the performance of Solana in a way that feels really intuitive.
00:02:17.888 - 00:02:35.604, Speaker A: That's really cool. Yeah. Usability and accessibility are, like, one of those pain points that everyone always talks about. That's never really, like, a thing that even normal financial applications focus on. Right. Like, I don't go to bank my bank of America website and, like, feel like I'm have a great experience there.
00:02:37.664 - 00:03:30.454, Speaker C: Yeah. I think with, you know, like, if we're able to rebuild financial institutions on crypto, I mean, certain things will be the same, but other things will be radically different. And I think one thing that will be radically different is, like, how much basically bureaucracy there is in between kind of like the core financial tools and then people. So then I think one of the consequences there is like the products themselves will feel a lot more personal, and I think the gap between, say, users and even founders will feel like a lot closer. And I think that even the way that we build products, I think we have that in mind. Right. We kind of understand that in the future it's just like orca itself will be very impactful, but it will also be a very thin layer in the financial stack of crypto.
00:03:30.574 - 00:03:58.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I think what's really kind of exciting to me about crypto is that typically this, like financial applications are really hard to get off the ground. Like how long does it take for like a major institution to build a product versus you guys were able just a small team, like build this awesome experience that's doing something really, really complicated and really financial with a lot of volume and like a lot of money at risk.
00:03:58.826 - 00:04:23.738, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think we have your team to take for that in a lot of ways. You know, having the financial primitives, having token swap out there as an existing smart contract for us to build on was obviously huge. We're in the middle of writing our yield farming smart contract right now, and this stuff isn't simple. So having those reference implementations out there to get us started is really what made it possible.
00:04:23.906 - 00:04:24.282, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:24.338 - 00:04:27.674, Speaker A: What is your, I guess, vision for yield farming?
00:04:27.754 - 00:05:26.258, Speaker C: I guess one thing is we want it to be accessible, so we want to write it in a way where, first of all, the smart contract is open source, people can verify themselves. And I think we want as many things on orca to be self service as opposed to having it run through us. So, yeah, eventually it'd be great if a program or like a project wants to list a token on orca, and then they can set, you know, the emissions rate themselves and they can like provide the tokens themselves that users can yield farm with. And, yeah, I mean, we want it to be flexible. I think another thing is like, we'll see where yield farming goes from here, right? Like we've only had r1 market cycle for yield farming to develop, and I think it's going to like mature into something that's a little more sophisticated over time. So, yeah, we'll kind of like, see where yield farming goes from here.
00:05:26.426 - 00:06:08.416, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say that's our technical viewpoint in terms of the shorter term, like, what is your liquidity mining program type question that a lot of users are bound to have? I would say that we are structuring everything to be as fair as possible. We want orca governance tokens to go to people who provide value to orca, and I think most people can probably infer what that means. But, you know, we're not going to airdrop to users who are not contributing real value just for marketing. I think we have pretty strong principles there. Whatever contributes to the healthiest orca ecosystem is going to be the way that we structure our program.
00:06:08.560 - 00:06:09.096, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:09.200 - 00:06:21.604, Speaker A: Cool. Do you think that NFTs will play into this? You guys have like, I think a really clever initial kind of like campaign, which I loved. Do you want to talk about it? Because I don't even know if users are familiar with it.
00:06:21.904 - 00:07:20.716, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been really fun and crazy to kind of see where this has gone, to be honest. Like pre NFT boom, I was actually just following along with this stuff as sort of, you know, a tech art general interest. And I had observed how things had gone with cryptopunks and cryptokitties. And I thought it was really neat how there's this whole new generation of digital artists and digital art that's evolving related to crypto. But I had also noticed that all these crypto art projects kind of existed standalone and weren't really integrated with actual defi applications out there. And so this is where I thought it'd be cool if we created our own, essentially nfts, what we call our collectibles, that we've distributed to our early users for different things, like early traders as well as some of our top liquidity providers. And you know, honestly, I was thinking of them as just like sort of a fun, you know, video game achievement kind of thing.
00:07:20.716 - 00:08:02.864, Speaker B: Something that I've really enjoyed with Orca is that I do like all the design. So I hand drew all these little guys myself and yeah, I thought it was like Pokemon cards, but then immediately, as soon as we distributed them, it turned into like a whole insane secondary market trading thing. And so we had $10,000 guppies that we gave out like these cute little guppy fish tokens. And each one went to people who traded at least $10 USD value on orca in the beginning. And at some point in like the serum secondary markets, they were selling for $100 each. And people were just speculating like crazy. And I was like, I guess I'm a million dollar NFT artist.
00:08:03.444 - 00:08:04.624, Speaker A: That's kind of cool.
00:08:06.084 - 00:08:49.756, Speaker C: Yeah, collectibles definitely took on a life of its own and we learned a lot just through the entire process in terms of like, you know, what the community is looking for, like, what they're interested in. But, you know, for me, like, I think what would be really cool is if, like, the community contributed and, like, built interesting applications that are in the spirit of orcas brand and kind of like the collectibles brand, for example. It'd be so cool if, like, someone built, you know, a, like a game that you can play on the web browser and you need like a guppy token to play, you know, like, and then you get to play as like a guppy or something like that. Maybe like a side scrolling platformer game or something like that. That would be really cool.
00:08:49.860 - 00:09:13.164, Speaker B: That's my dream. Well, we actually have a prize out for the hackathon that's happening right now. Solana season for anyone who builds something really cool on top of either Orca's core amm or our collectible. So if you're interested in building a guppy themed game or whale or starfish or any of our other collectibles, feel free to experiment with that because I guess you can be rewarded for it.
00:09:14.384 - 00:09:31.290, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super cool. I thought it'd be really funny if somebody build a visualizer for all the markets in Solana that look like the pit from New York Stock Exchange, but it was all just nfts, like yelling prices.
00:09:31.362 - 00:09:32.814, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:09:34.154 - 00:09:34.562, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:34.578 - 00:09:44.314, Speaker A: If anyone's listening, there could be guppies or little whales, right? And sharks all yelling prices at each other.
00:09:44.434 - 00:09:46.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I love it.
00:09:47.874 - 00:09:52.058, Speaker A: How do you guys see, like, the future of this, like, decentralized finance evolving?
00:09:52.186 - 00:10:23.242, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good question. It's hard to predict. It's one thing. Like, you know, there are certain things that are certain though, right? Like, no matter how things evolve, there's always going to be a need to swap one token for another. And, you know, users are always going to want it to be a good experience and users are always going to want good execution. Another thing is lending and borrowing, right? That is always going to exist no matter what. From there, it's kind of hard to say.
00:10:23.242 - 00:10:50.242, Speaker C: Like, I'm interested in seeing more retail focused applications, right? Like, I remember back in, you know, when we were involved in Ethereum, we were, people were talking about how cool it would be if people could just like, you know, pay each other for lunch using the Ethereum network. But you know how that was just feasible. But, you know, now we actually have a platform where we can do that. So, like, let's figure out how we can do that.
00:10:50.418 - 00:10:52.810, Speaker B: I've actually paid friends in Seoul before. I don't know about you.
00:10:52.842 - 00:11:09.658, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, yeah. So then, like, I would love to see more retail focused applications. And then I think as we get more retail focused applications, we'll see what are the financial instruments that people need, and then let's build those things.
00:11:09.786 - 00:11:27.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that approach. Do you think that the crypto as a market is now big enough to iterate on the actual user experiences? Because in 2017, during the boom, there was just not enough people that you can even test, like, is this good ux?
00:11:30.034 - 00:11:32.826, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. I guess so.
00:11:32.970 - 00:12:14.378, Speaker B: Well, I would say that what good ux is completely depends on who the users are. So right now, when you hear people talk about crypto Ux, I think something that you hear a lot is like, well, you know, if there's enough money involved, people will jump through hoops. And so, like, Ux doesn't really matter. And to some extent that's true. You know, if you can get these insane returns, then people will jump through hoops. But that also kind of means that the use of crypto right now is limited to, like, insane returns for people who already have the technical knowledge and assets to take advantage of those. And so, like, I think good ux is kind of meaningless unless you think about the long term, like, utility.
00:12:14.378 - 00:13:16.886, Speaker B: Like, what is the user experience that actually matters here? And so I guess my dream for crypto and what actually gets me really excited to think about is this probably still far off, but not that far off in technology terms, maybe future where crypto is actually relevant and useful to everyday people. I've also had to accept that there's going to be a road to get there. And what we're doing is building this foundational infrastructure to make that possible. But for now, it's a building process. And later on, I think we'll see more cool things with stable coins, average people having more ways to diversify their assets, average people having ways to interact with crypto that don't involve, basically huge risks of loss from speculation. And right now, we're having a lot of fun as builders. But, yeah, that long term vision for us of basically having crypto be something that actually increases instead of decreases economic opportunity and economic equity is really exciting.
00:13:16.990 - 00:13:18.206, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure.
00:13:18.390 - 00:13:23.114, Speaker A: What are, like, the baby steps? What's next? How do we get there?
00:13:23.734 - 00:14:14.732, Speaker B: Well, baby steps for Solana, partially, I think, are making it easier for people just to build apps. You know, like, we don't actually have a widely used lending protocol yet on Solana. It's definitely going to happen, but, you know, writing this rest smart contract code myself right now, like, this is not something that your average developer is just going to wake up one day and start pumping out smart contracts. I think once we actually make that money, Lego's dream real and it's easier for people to build and then we'll be able to once we have a huge ecosystem. Naturally, I think all of these applications are going to compete on uX. Whether they think about it that way or not. Ultimately users will go where the best UX is, which is a combination of what you might traditionally think of as design.
00:14:14.732 - 00:14:20.316, Speaker B: And ultimately like the returns that they can get, for example, if that's what they're, they're going for.
00:14:20.420 - 00:15:15.558, Speaker A: That's I think a really good observation at least that's, there's always a subset of people that really care about ux, you know, and this is why they like buy Apple devices at a premium over. That's totally true. I'm really curious how that plays out into like a decentralized development model because like, you know, apple, it was such a top down, like, you know, dictator driven Steve Jobs kind of place. How do you see, like, is it, and like my experience with Linux which was really like, and you know, my, my, like, my thing that I grew up with as the decentralized project with all, always like the worst user experience as you can imagine. How do you guys, like, I think, like, I really wish for you guys to succeed, but how do you guys plan on doing that?
00:15:15.726 - 00:16:03.936, Speaker B: Thank you. We wish for it too. Yeah, I think for us it's about setting orca on the right course early on and bringing on people who really believe in that vision to help us basically align incentives. Like, I think most projects start out less decentralized than the community might wish, right? They're all like, it's not really decentralized if x, y, z. But, you know, we're still so early in this experiment of decentralization. Like that is ultimately our goal as orca because we want Orca to be something that can function and can develop over time without, you know, Yutaro and I needing to be online when we're like 65. And so I think there's like, yeah, like by then I want to be full, I want to be fully retired much earlier than that.
00:16:03.936 - 00:16:32.606, Speaker B: But like it's all about setting like the conditions, right? Like, and I think so far the people that we've had like in the orca community are incredible. I think we've set this expectation that orca is like a protocol that's doing things right. We're not a pump and dump. We want to be here for the long term and to provide real value. And just as a result of that we've already had like a surprising number of people just be like, hey, what can I do? I want to be part of orca. I want to be a CM. I want to develop.
00:16:32.606 - 00:16:36.966, Speaker B: And just like seeing that I think has been really encouraging.
00:16:37.150 - 00:17:32.477, Speaker C: Yeah, I think comparing say like Solana to the or any kind of decentralized ecosystem on crypto to Linux is a really interesting comparison. And I wonder if there's like something we can learn from there from our perspective. I feel like right now Solana is just too young for like a decentralized protocol kind of like sushi swap to emerge because there's just not a big enough pool of like crypto native basically like developers and community members that can really like build protocol organically. I think that's just going to take time. And I wonder with like Linux, did you really, did you see a pool of basically people that were ready to contribute to something and did that allow Linux to flourish?
00:17:32.605 - 00:18:11.882, Speaker A: I mean it took a long time and it was driven by Linus and he's still kind of the driver of it, which I think in some cases a bit of a detriment to its adoption. Right. But like this is sushiswap is a really great example. I think they've remarkably transformed into this like open ecosystem where like hey, just throw something into the bento box and see if users like it. Right. I think that's really cool. They're one of the folks that I look to in terms of like how do you actually like encourage people to come in and take ownership of big pieces, right, of the code base and things like that.
00:18:11.882 - 00:18:47.258, Speaker A: And tokens I think are something that Linux doesn't have. Which is why the people that ended up developing and still developing now are like the Googles and the apples, the Qualcomms. So they kind of like took over the. Not the apples, the Microsofts, I guess, which surprisingly right. People kind of have to get paid to do this really complex work. So it'll be interesting to see if this can develop organically at the protocol layers. I think it's a lot easier in some cases than at the core layer.
00:18:47.258 - 00:19:03.214, Speaker A: But for the financial pieces are fairly transferable from Ethereum to Solana and vice versa to some extent you can implement things that just do a bit more computationally intensive, things that would be really hard to migrate.
00:19:03.874 - 00:19:38.670, Speaker B: I actually think the analogy with Linux is kind of hilarious because this is something that we fight about all the time in terms of Linux versus macOS. And I actually think that's like a pretty good analogy for the Solana ecosystem right now. Where I think of maybe serum is closer to Linux. And it's like this incredibly powerful financial building block that we've already seen a lot of people start building off of in different ways. But there's a reason that average people don't use Linux right now. It's incredibly powerful and I think incredibly cool. But the average person.
00:19:38.670 - 00:20:20.250, Speaker B: If my grandma can use an iPad, I'm really happy. I'm not trying to get her to use Linux. And I think Orca is actually trying to be the iPad. You don't need deep knowledge of Solana or the account model or anything like that. Ideally just to jump on orca and start making swaps. I think that's the value that we bring, is translating that complexity into something that's easily accessible and black boxed enough that people who don't care don't need to look at the internals, but also open enough that people who do care can just go look at our smart contract and say, okay, I trust that this works because I can see all the code.
00:20:20.402 - 00:20:37.196, Speaker C: Yeah. And I guess on the other hand, like Linux has basically dominated the server operating system game. And I mean, I use Linux as well, so I think it's good to have both approaches in an open ecosystem.
00:20:37.340 - 00:20:47.900, Speaker B: Yeah, neither is better than the other. And I think both just serve different users. Again, UX is only as good as its understanding of who its targets users are.
00:20:47.972 - 00:20:55.268, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great observation. So you mentioned lending. Are you guys working on a really awesome UX for lending?
00:20:55.396 - 00:21:28.084, Speaker B: If we could clone ourselves, I think that would be really cool. We have a really exciting roadmap for Orca and I think there's so much that we can do to innovate on just the core amm model that's actually like what we're really like, geared up and excited to do. Because I think we actually love the idea of working on lending, but we're like. We just can't. What. Something we've learned is that we shouldn't spread our focus too thin. And there's like so much to do in terms of just amms.
00:21:28.084 - 00:21:35.244, Speaker B: We've been talking about this idea that we talk about called whirlpools for a while. I don't know if you want to talk about etaro.
00:21:35.364 - 00:22:25.486, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean whirlpools. Yeah. I guess like, you know, I still remember when I first like, read the code for Uniswap v one. And I loved how simple it was, and I just loved how before that, like, most people were trying to build an order book, Dex on Ethereum, and it clearly wasn't working. Then you just see this code that you can basically read in 15 minutes, and you can basically understand how it works, and you can basically have a fairly high level of confidence that it's just going to work and that there aren't really any potential serious security concerns because it's so simple. I think one of the biggest issues that people always saw with amms were the capital inefficiency. And I think, for example, like, uniswap v three has really tackled that problem head on.
00:22:25.486 - 00:22:46.714, Speaker C: And I think, like, for us, the next evolution for, you know, the smart contract for Orca is going to be basically tackling capital inefficiency. You know, like Uniswap V three, for example, had, I think they, like, use the concept concentrated liquidity. And, you know, we basically had the same idea for a while as well.
00:22:47.654 - 00:23:10.414, Speaker B: Yutaro was so bummed when the details of uniswap v three came out because he was like, that's my idea. I've been wanting to do this forever, and it's okay. Yutaro, I think seeing that it can be done and we can actually learn a lot from the way that they do things, but there's actually a lot that we can do simply because we're built on Solana that you can't do on Ethereum.
00:23:10.534 - 00:23:31.374, Speaker C: Yeah, I think their approach is really awesome. It's like incredibly innovative. I think we kind of have our approach that we want to experiment with as well. So, yeah, that's something that we want to get working on in Q three. Maybe like Q three pretty much whenever.
00:23:31.794 - 00:23:59.808, Speaker B: It hits our top of list of priorities. Like, we did mention wanting to make it easier for people to list any token on orca. That's what I love, branding this stuff. So I'm thinking of that as like, our community pools project, and then we'll move on to whirlpools. Like, whirlpools because it's concentrated liquidity and everything fits into the marine theme. Yeah, but yeah, I think, like, speaking of ux, like, Ux also extends to, like, the developer experience. Right.
00:23:59.808 - 00:24:35.824, Speaker B: And I think uniswap V three is incredibly cool and has a lot of potential, but it's also pretty complex. Right. Like, you have these nfts that are kind of playing the role of pool tokens. Every single liquidity position is sort of bespoke. And I think it remains to be seen whether that's going to allow for more innovation in the uniswap ecosystem. So we're thinking about also potentially, like, simpler approaches that still allow LP's to get some of the benefits of concentrated liquidity and of, like, more capital efficiency without actually having to make as many decisions themselves.
00:24:36.244 - 00:25:04.584, Speaker C: And once we get the orca governance token out, I think we'll spend some time looking at uniswap v three data on Mainnet, on Ethereum, and I'm sure there's just a ton that we can learn from seeing how LP's actually use it, seeing what kind of slippage users are able to see, and what the capital efficiencies people are able to see, and then that might allow us to tweak the design for whirlpool that we have in mind something better.
00:25:05.164 - 00:25:14.876, Speaker A: That's super cool. Yeah. I had the same experience reading the Uniswap code, and I was like, this is like a perfect money, like, yeah, and it's awesome.
00:25:14.980 - 00:25:15.664, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:16.444 - 00:25:54.288, Speaker A: Ironically, while, like, serum was building the serum dex, which is like a masterpiece of work coming from them, there's, like, this other thing that I was like, oh, like, this is really cool, too. And I always thought, wondered, is it possible to get the best of both worlds? Have every LP draw their bezier curve or something like that? I never really explored those ideas, but I'm excited that you guys are, because I think it's definitely worthwhile. How big is your team, and how do you balance innovation versus shipping stuff as fast as you can?
00:25:54.376 - 00:26:10.752, Speaker C: Yeah. Or you mentioned earlier on, between September and February, when we building, before we were public, we had so many ideas and we were like, oh, like, this would be awesome. This would be awesome. Lending would be awesome. Aggregating liquidity was a time where we.
00:26:10.768 - 00:26:12.096, Speaker B: Thought we would build a lending protocol.
00:26:12.160 - 00:26:32.164, Speaker C: Yeah, there actually was, but again, like, we realized we really have to just, like, focus on the things that only orca can do. So, yeah, I mean, we basically just have a roadmap, which is like, what are the most important things to make orca a better dex? And we're just trying to knock it out one step at a time.
00:26:32.824 - 00:27:16.836, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say that in terms of our team, I think our team is actually pretty special. Like, we haven't been super public with our identities so far, but honestly, that's really just been kind of an experiment too. Like, kind of conscious of privacy, trying to just, like, launch something and see how it goes. But actually, like, there's really not much for us to hide. And so I think, like, when people actually hear about the experience that we have, where Yutaro has been in Ethereum for a long time, worked on Uma, worked on ETH 2.0, I think that gives him a really long term view. And that, as well as the fact that we both kind of have long term development backgrounds, worked at brand name Silicon Valley and New York companies.
00:27:16.836 - 00:28:06.122, Speaker B: And so we kind of know what good engineering looks like. Plus we have this background deep in crypto. And then myself coming in with more fresh eyes, actually, I think was a really good thing too. I have experience as a developer at startups and also as a designer. But when I came into crypto, I was like, man, this is just the classic example of a ton of solutions running around looking for problems, and then all of the actual problems are just languishing. And so that's where when I did user research, which I assume that most people in this space probably don't even try to do, is like, when I talked to actual defi users, they were like, yeah, so when I go and make a swap on uniswap, I'll open a tab and open uniswap. And then I'll also open a tab and open one inch and check the price there.
00:28:06.122 - 00:28:34.380, Speaker B: And then I'll also open a tab and check the price on binance, just in case, and also one on coingecko, you know, if I feel like it or if there's too much discrepancy. And I was like, this is crazy. Like, why can't people just see the price of tokens in the swap interface? And so I think that's where our combination of expertise came in to make these small changes that are honestly all low hanging fruit and just provide a way better experience. So I guess our team, I feel, is pretty special in that way.
00:28:34.452 - 00:29:10.384, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say so. We are a fairly small team and we're growing it right now. We hired our first full time engineer a few weeks ago, actually. He's awesome. Yeah. And we have a few candidates in our pipeline that we're gonna hopefully have, you know, like working full time in the next, like month to two months and, yeah, I mean, like, we're basically just using our personal network and finding people that are interested in crypto. Thankfully, that's a little easier now than it was like a year or two ago.
00:29:10.504 - 00:29:43.078, Speaker B: Yeah, our first engineer, we love him. He's Yutaro's best friend. Like, he's a long term degen. He's also like former Google engineer, he's just, like, the perfect fit. I remember one day he was just like, we had some catch up because he had been, like, helping out with some stuff for orca, and he was like, all right, guys, I've decided, like, I'm gonna quit my job and join Orca. And we're like, woo, let's make this happen. And, like, I think it's just been amazing seeing all the natural interests.
00:29:43.078 - 00:30:12.826, Speaker B: People are so psyched to build crypto stuff. People are super psyched to join a small team because I think something that it's easy to forget when you're in this space is how crazy all of this seems from the outside. The fact that a five to ten person team can build something, the scale of uniswap is just amazing. It's liberating. Of course, there's less red tape when you have five people instead of, I don't know, how many people work at, like, bank of America, you know, and.
00:30:12.850 - 00:30:49.242, Speaker A: So, like, yeah, I think, like, the. Yeah, the. The beauty of this is always, like, to me is, like, the cryptography, actually, people having those keys and making the whole system peer to peer because you have that, like, guarantee that it's me talking to somebody else around the world. And it's really wild that it kind of, I think I always kind of think of it as, like, a going from this, like, social graph world where there's somebody always in between you to, like, a fully connected world where it's every. Everything is peer to peer.
00:30:49.338 - 00:31:12.126, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's really cool how even for us, like, you know, we, we went public and we basically have an immediate, like, we immediately had a global market, and then it was very unexpected where the users came. I wouldn't say it was completely unexpected, but it was very organic and, you know, just, like, seeing, like, how much traction we got in Asia was, like, pretty cool.
00:31:12.310 - 00:31:52.496, Speaker B: It's really an unexplored space. You know, I think the fact that it's so global also makes the regulatory side really interesting and really complicated. And, you know, you have users who are like, you should ship stuff every day. Why don't you just do XYZ? And we're like, have you thought about the legal implications of that? Like, we have to. I know you don't think about this. Yeah. So that's something also where we spend a lot of time making sure that we do things right, because we really do care about, like, not just building a project, but building a project, like, the right way in a way that will be resilient, hopefully, and, like, you know, in a way that is honest and transparent.
00:31:52.496 - 00:32:09.944, Speaker B: And I think with, like, this constantly changing world of crypto regulation, that's the best thing you can do, is just to try to abide by the best possible practices and create something that, like, create, that provides so much value to this, like, new Internet economy that, like, no one would want to shut it down.
00:32:10.844 - 00:32:11.580, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:11.732 - 00:32:29.118, Speaker A: My experience with the Internet was this, watching, like, people grow into it versus, like, the Internet really changing. Do you think that people are just going to grow into crypto, or is crypto going to, like, kind of change dramatically over, like, the next five to ten years?
00:32:29.286 - 00:33:13.336, Speaker C: Yeah, I think people will definitely grow into crypto. That is definitely going to be true. I think certain things in crypto will improve, but others will not necessarily change. For example, I think key management, I think certain problems with it will be mitigated, but at the end of the day, it's not going to be completely solved. I think it's either going to have to be a centralized custodial solution, or people will have to manage their own risks of managing their own keys. I think that is not going to change. Things that will change is like, transaction throughput will improve.
00:33:13.336 - 00:33:30.500, Speaker C: Well, I mean, I guess I'm coming from the Ethereum world. Obviously, we are working on Solana because we believe that transaction throughput will increase while keeping things sufficiently decentralized. And I think that that trend will continue somewhat.
00:33:30.692 - 00:34:28.354, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe that crypto is just going to become way more integrated into the way that we do things. And so what crypto means is going to be very different in the future where it might be more of, like, the backbone of the Internet economy, but maybe everyone's using it without realizing that they're using it. I think that's one of, like, the common feces that people talk about. And coming back to our early analogy, right? Like, I think most Mac OS X users are not thinking about underlying Unix systems, right? Like, these things have just become so integrated that people will be using it whether they know or care or not. And I actually think that would be a great place for us to get, get to, for crypto because the idea of the most of the world's population trying to manage their own keys is terrifying to me, to be honest. I don't know if people in the future are going to be, like, biometrically authenticating or what they're going to be doing, but they're probably not going to be carrying around ledgers.
00:34:28.654 - 00:34:29.434, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:29.974 - 00:34:46.287, Speaker A: What I think is weird is that the browser I look at it. There's still a URL bar, and that was in the first version of the browser that was still there. There's still links, and even though, like, it's mostly the same, you know?
00:34:46.335 - 00:35:21.024, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I think that, you know, crypto maximalists, like us, vaguely see the power of what happens if, you know, all these things are composable and, like, essentially atomic and how that can, like, basically change everything. But I think people that are, like, more crypto skeptics, they don't really see how that can change, and they only see, like, the limitations of, like, transaction throughput or, like, the difficulty of key management.
00:35:21.364 - 00:35:58.006, Speaker B: Core technology can stay the same, and all the experience around it can evolve in a way that is almost unrecognizable to be one. Right. Like, the URL bar is still there, but how often do you go in and type HTTPs? You know, like, when I go anywhere, even new on the web, I just google it. Right? Like, I google it from the URL bar, but, like, I'm not entering these uris. Right. And so I kind of expect something similar for crypto. Like, people are going to open their wallet somehow and interact with crypto in the future, but it's probably.
00:35:58.006 - 00:36:01.754, Speaker B: Probably not in the form of keys and seed phrases.
00:36:01.914 - 00:36:02.418, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:02.506 - 00:36:22.338, Speaker A: Yeah. It's interesting how this stuff can evolve in so many different ways. But I do believe that, like, if people still need some form of understanding, that there's a key and a secret, and they have custody of that thing, and that's what gives them, like, that power. We'll see what happens, though.
00:36:22.426 - 00:36:31.974, Speaker C: Yeah. Speaking of cryptography, I was wondering what Solana had in mind in terms of supporting zero knowledge proofs.
00:36:32.314 - 00:37:17.200, Speaker A: Yeah, we have a, Greg, who's one of the co founders, has been deep in and trying to understand cryptography, and we have some folks joining. Part of the challenge there is that the technologies right now are not really. It's so early, it's really hard to bootstrap any of these systems without potentially making a mistake. You know, the bug in sapling was fixed, like, three years later after sea cache was launched. And it's really scary to, like, as a operating systems engineer, it's hairy. It's scary to handle that code right. Like, to handle the math right.
00:37:17.200 - 00:37:26.744, Speaker A: You kind of don't have intuition into it, like, where stuff breaks. I always feel like I know enough to be really dangerous in cryptography.
00:37:28.204 - 00:37:28.820, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:28.932 - 00:38:05.964, Speaker A: Some of the things that I think are doable are more like simpler systems, like bulletproofs, where you have, like, these not fully zero knowledge fully anonymous systems, but where you have some pseudo anonymity and you can maintain, like, basically confidentiality of the amounts transferred and things like that in a peer to peer fashion, which could be like, if you scale that to 100 million people, could be really powerful, because it does kind of give you some privacy and some, by the sheer nature of the public keys themselves, some pseudo anonymity there.
00:38:06.084 - 00:38:16.892, Speaker C: Yeah. It'd be really cool if Solana allowed application developers like us to experiment with generating proofs or verification of proofs at the application level.
00:38:17.028 - 00:38:40.584, Speaker A: So it's all rust, right? So you can definitely write that code and load it up, that's for sure. Yeah, yeah. So those curve operations and everything like that, you can definitely evaluate them. It's just like, whenever I talk to somebody in cryptography, they're like, when I ask them what should I use? They point me at a paper that's three months old. I'm like, oh, give me something that's five to ten years old.
00:38:41.924 - 00:38:43.572, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true.
00:38:43.708 - 00:39:25.634, Speaker B: Hearing you say that, though, honestly, like, it just underscores for me why we picked Solana, because I think you get a lot of folks in the crypto space who are either too far on the research side or actually not really that experienced with building real businesses or real applications. And I guess, being industry trained engineers ourselves, when we saw that your team has really been in the trenches when it comes to hardware, you run into real problems that you just don't experience if you're just on the research side. And so, like, hearing you say that, like, x makes you scared, I think, is, like, a really good thing that makes us less scared.
00:39:27.094 - 00:39:28.758, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good point.
00:39:28.926 - 00:40:01.354, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a really tough challenge. I've only really experienced it when shipping, like, firmware for mobile devices, and that was like twice a year kind of thing. But in crypto, you know, you ship a feature, like, every month or so. Right. And if it's an on chain code chain to potentially be exploited, you see this stuff happen, like, in massive amounts, and it's always like, I'm loading firmware into the global bank. It just blow up at any moment. It's only scary.
00:40:01.354 - 00:40:12.206, Speaker A: What are you guys plans for products and stuff for this year? We briefly talked about it, but is there anything else that you guys can share?
00:40:12.310 - 00:41:16.482, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess those are the things that are actually a little farther out in terms of how excited we are to innovate on the core amm. But we have a lot that's on the verge of coming out that's pretty publicly on our Q two roadmap, which I think is all about making orca more accessible to more people. And so, concretely, I think the first thing that we're planning to do is just list a bunch more tokens and make it a lot easier to list more tokens. I've been working on some stuff internally that makes it as easy for us as basically running a script to get new tokens listed. Beyond that, we're also planning to launch our stable pool. So it'll be like the Curvefi curve that we've been working on with John from the Solana team, and to be able to support way better execution on USDC, USDT, and any other future stable pools. Once we get that out, we also have our solar bridge is what we're calling our UI for wormhole, to make things like, yeah, just like way easier to get from Ethereum to Solana, and ideally, like, way easier to just start swapping on orca.
00:41:16.482 - 00:42:03.496, Speaker B: And all these things are actually in this like 80% done state, but then, like, the last 20% is the hardest, you know, because we're like, at least I'm spending like, all my dev time right now on getting our governance token and liquidity mining out. So there's like all these other work streams that are like almost there. But I think one thing that we're going to launch actually, like, really soon, as well as just localization on the UI. Yutaro sort of mentioned that we have tons of users in Asia, we have a lot in Vietnam and in Russia and in these markets that I think most folks actually don't really speak English. And so even though it's been not the most fun work to manually make each string translatable in the orca UI, things like that are actually huge. And I think most projects don't bother, and it's, it's a huge loss.
00:42:03.640 - 00:43:02.924, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm glad you guys are doing that. This is something that, yeah, we heard early on that that was important to do, and we didn't know how important that was going to be, but we had everything translated during our launch. And Raj submitted the, he pushed like a new release, right, like a build of the website, and it like, landed 2 seconds before, like, Binance tweeted out, like, solana's go to, and we had like 80,000 hits within a second. And we were able to see, like, from the data that a lot of people actually care about the localization. So that was really like one of those first moments where I realized that this is not just like a simple product you're building kind of this global thing from the ground up. It's just strange, right? Like, that the stuff that's just a big pile of code can connect people around the world and that it's just cryptography and a pile of code.
00:43:03.824 - 00:43:42.672, Speaker B: It's cheesy, but it's, like, really true in our experience. Like, we were basically just trying to get products out in the beginning, and then we were really active on the orca telegram and discord at first. We read every message in our telegram in the beginning. We have this incredible CM team now, basically, all of whom were just orca fans who were like, I want to be part of this. And we have our awesome Siem Yibo, who's based out of China. We have two folks who are based out of the UK. And, like, even without us trying, like, you know, Mike, our first engineers in California right now, and we're in Japan.
00:43:42.672 - 00:43:46.248, Speaker B: So, yeah, it is truly, like, a global force.
00:43:46.336 - 00:44:10.044, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah, it's remarkable, right, that this is. I think it's. There's, like, so many sides to crypto. I think when people look at stuff on the crypto Twitter and they see, like, people arguing and fighting, I think that's simply because it's Twitter. But reality is that, like, we all, like, just want to, like, together, like. Like, have fun and, like, build cool stuff.
00:44:10.044 - 00:44:32.810, Speaker A: It doesn't really matter, almost, like, what platform this stuff is on. Of course, Solana is my favorite, but. But, yeah, it's really cool that, like, just code can bring so many people together. How do you guys, I guess, plan on, like, growing the community? Is it simply, like, are you guys gonna do your own hackathons or, like, any other, like, events?
00:44:32.922 - 00:45:27.054, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we need to kind of grow out the team more before we can really, like, dedicate time to, I guess, cultivating community. Thankfully, you know, we already have a very active telegram and discord, and, you know, there's already kind of, like, a culture that's sprouting from these, like, social media channels, and we also have, like, a great cm team that's, like, helping us with it. I think one of the things that we want to push on maybe in, like, Q three, is, like, helping independent developers build integrations with orca. And I think once we can succeed at doing that, then we can succeed in, like, having a fairly diverse set of stakeholders that are interested in the success of orca. And I think that would be really cool.
00:45:27.434 - 00:46:08.862, Speaker B: I think we're already on the path there, actually. Like, we've been experimenting with it a bit like people have just started building on orca, like it or not. Right? And so we are actually have an independent contributor right now who just was interested in Orca, who's working on building out like an SDK, a typescript SDK for interacting with orca pools. Like there's obviously the AJs bindings already for token swap, but that requires you to have like a pretty sophisticated understanding of this and a token and token swap models. And so we want to have a much easier SDK where folks can basically just plug in SOL USDC and make a swap without having to know what that pool address is, for example.
00:46:08.918 - 00:46:09.230, Speaker A: Nice.
00:46:09.302 - 00:46:23.810, Speaker B: And so I think developer experience, stuff like that, is going to be eventually what makes orca that real building block, because I think that's what's so cool about amms. They are this sort of theoretically plug and play thing experience.
00:46:23.962 - 00:46:38.018, Speaker A: That's super cool. So on that note, like, I just want to thank you guys for coming on the podcast, but more importantly, just for building stuff. I mean, that's awesome. I love the vision and like, you guys have had a really remarkable success. So thank you guys so much.
00:46:38.146 - 00:46:39.434, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you.
00:46:39.554 - 00:46:40.634, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been our pleasure.
