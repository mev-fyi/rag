00:00:01.320 - 00:00:30.502, Speaker A: Welcome to the Solana Mobile Saga preview the under edition. I'm Laura Shen. I lead marketing for Solana Mobile. Our team is very excited to be here this week in Melbourne, almost at Lisbon in Melbourne, and spend some time with Solana community, the Aussie Solana community. Here. We were talking, Steven and I were talking earlier this week. It really.
00:00:30.502 - 00:01:18.864, Speaker A: Spending time with the community really reminds us why we do what we do and we're building this device for the people in the community and try to make the web survey experience better. So really, the energy has been amazing and it really re energizes people like me to keep doing what we do. So I'll give a quick run of a show tonight. So our team is going to give a quick update of what we've been up to for the past couple months. Then Stephen will showcase some mobile native experiences and use cases that's enabled by Saga and SMS. We will hear from four speakers, so start with Stephen Laver. He's the head of engineering of Solana Mobile.
00:01:18.864 - 00:02:07.454, Speaker A: Then we'll have Sydney Jang from Magic Eden and also tiff Huang from Magic Eden. Woohoo. And also Cindy Liu from drift protocol. We will save about ten to 15 minutes for Q and A at the very end, so make sure you have questions. And after all the programming is done, we'll bring out six Solana mobile devices on display over there so you can have a hands on experience with the phones. And especially pay attention to what Stephen says in his presentation because there's one new use case that we're going to unveil today that is very special to us. With that, I want to introduce Steven.
00:02:07.454 - 00:02:22.946, Speaker A: He's the head of engineering for Solana Mobile. He's been working on SMS and Saga for about a year.
00:02:23.050 - 00:02:24.340, Speaker B: Exactly one year now.
00:02:24.482 - 00:02:25.552, Speaker A: Yeah, today's his anniversary.
00:02:25.568 - 00:02:27.844, Speaker C: Today is my one year solanaversary anniversary.
00:02:30.064 - 00:02:55.450, Speaker A: And that, in crypto terms, is about seven years, right? And that accounts for about a third of his esteemed career working in mobile, starting in BlackBerry, at BlackBerry, and then most recently finished at Google and Apple. So, basically, long story short, if you want someone to work on a mobile device and a mobile stack, this is the person you want working on it.
00:02:55.562 - 00:02:56.082, Speaker B: All right?
00:02:56.178 - 00:02:58.058, Speaker A: So leave the floor with you.
00:02:58.186 - 00:03:41.374, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you, Laura. All right, good evening, everyone. I am thrilled to be here in Melbourne to showcase Saga and SMS for Australia and New Zealand, which we are really happy we were able to add as two launch markets for the device. There is an amazing community of builders, developers here for the Solana ecosystem and being able to not just take advantage of that, but really launch our Saga device that we're so proud of into this market when we release Saga a little bit later this year. I am thrilled. Let's start off and talk a little bit about Saga.
00:03:41.374 - 00:04:36.754, Speaker B: Just a quick recap in June of last year, which feels like both forever ago and just days ago at the same time, we announced two things. Saga, which is our crypto native web3 phone that we're building, as well as the Solana mobile stack, and because we like ridiculous acronyms, of course, SMS. So the saga device, flagship specs, beautiful industrial design. We're really excited to be working with our phone partner, awesome, who's helping us build what we think is really a flagship device that everyone's going to love. And then on it, it's going to be the first device that launches with the full Solana mobile stack, which is made up of three key technologies. Our seed vault, which is our solution for secure key custody on mobile devices. The mobile wallet adapter connecting dapps and wallets together on mobile.
00:04:36.754 - 00:05:01.914, Speaker B: And finally, the Solana Dapp store. Finally, a place to land those web3 first experiences on mobile. And so the first question I always get asked is, when? When saga. And of course, because this is Melbourne, Wen Saga, Australia. And I actually think the person who tweeted this might even be in the audience here today. So there he is. Perfect.
00:05:01.914 - 00:05:35.674, Speaker B: So please excuse the cheesy animation. I couldn't help myself, but I am thrilled to announce that it's early 2023 and this phone is coming. We're putting the final touches on the software now. Still has to be a little bit of manufacturing to do, actually have to ship a physical product, but I can't wait to put these in people's hands. So you can pre order yours now@solanamobile.com. Dot and like I mentioned before, one more cheesy graphic. Australia, New Zealand included.
00:05:35.674 - 00:06:31.032, Speaker B: So I want to spend just a couple minutes talking about why saga? For me, this is actually more why mobile, right? Our mobile devices are personal. We have them either with us, in our purses, in our pockets, or at worst case, arm's length, almost all the time. They're an intimate device that we always have with us, has the most intimate moments of our life on it, and enables all the use cases that we now take for granted. Photography, travel, everything that we do is enabled by this device that we have in our hands. Except for somehow, web3 hasn't quite made it there yet. On average, people check their phones nearly 100 times a day. That is such a different way of using your technology from sitting down at a computer.
00:06:31.032 - 00:07:08.878, Speaker B: And so we've really divided up into the three themes we want to tackle with Saga, the first of which I call pervasive computing. Like we said, our phones come everywhere with us. They're always connected, which means that all of a sudden, we no longer need to unpack our laptops, sit down at a desktop. We don't need to spend all this time to engage. We can engage in tiny, short bursts consistently. And that's what I'm excited to bring with Saga, is the ability to engage all the time, whenever something happens. Whenever, like maybe, you know, there's a movement in defi, maybe there's an NFT mint going on.
00:07:08.878 - 00:07:46.810, Speaker B: But closely related is the idea of asynchronous notifications. We shouldn't have to dedicate one iota of our gray matter to remembering things that we could be told on our devices. When, you know, Facebook, when we get a message there, we get a little pop up, a notification on our phone that tells us it's time to engage. When stock prices move up or they move down, our phones tell us web3 should be the same. It should tell us when we get a secure message delivered on chain. It should tell us when there's movement in our defi. And most importantly, it should tell us when an NFT mint is dropping.
00:07:46.810 - 00:08:23.794, Speaker B: No one wants to miss that. No one should have to drag their laptop to dinner just so they don't miss an NFT mint. And then finally, holding the phone in my hand, it struck me that this is a physical artifact. It's this gateway between our physical lives that we live every day in this world and our digital lives. And so all the things that a phone can do, like these, are packed full of sensors. We've got cameras, there's GPs, there's NFC. All of these things enable use cases that we would want to do on the go, but really need a device that has all those capabilities.
00:08:23.794 - 00:09:05.950, Speaker B: So, for example, the biometric sensors on devices, whether that be a fingerprint, like on saga, a face print, et cetera, using that to securely unlock your seeds on the go so you can actually carry them with you and use your private keys to do all these use cases without having to drag a second device along with you. Cameras, QR code scanning, or NFC taps for payments. All of these use cases enabled by mobile phones. And so the idea of your phone is a digital gateway. To me, the story is really about not, let's bring web3 to mobile, which is a laudable goal. We should absolutely do that. But let's bring mobile to web3.
00:09:05.950 - 00:09:47.810, Speaker B: All the things that we can only do because of our phones. That's what we should be targeting, and that's what we're doing with both Saga and the Solana mobile stack. Let's switch over now and talk a little bit about SMS. The first thing I want to talk about is the Dapp store. We're launching our web3 friendly or web3 focused way to distribute DApps on mobile devices. So the biggest thing, why are we doing this? It's for the crypto friendly policies, the existing duopoly of App Stores. Their policies don't always support and in some cases actively inhibit the use cases that we all want to do on our mobile devices.
00:09:47.810 - 00:10:31.884, Speaker B: And so Saga gives us a channel that we can load, an application store that is web3 centric and designed for all these use cases. So first of all, it's fee free. We don't want to get in the way of the business relationships that developers should have with their users. And so the only fees involved are the network transaction fees on Solana. There's no subscription fees. Solana Mobile doesn't take a cut of anything. Also, we want to enable all of these use cases and more digital goods, defi, gaming wallets, purchasing nfts, all of these things that are either made harder or made impossible by the rules of the current App Stores.
00:10:31.884 - 00:11:22.730, Speaker B: We not only want those, we're going to encourage and are specifically seeking those out for the Solana Dapp store. On our saga device, the Google Play Store is also present. There's a huge ecosystem of Android applications, and this phone is not Android different. It's a great Android device, plus all of these crypto features. So users do deserve all the protections that they do get from, like the Google Play store, for example. We still want to protect our users from malicious content, from spam, from illegal content, but we want to take away all the policies that are holding back web3. Specifically the big two are sale of digital goods, some restrictions on what you can do with DeFi, and then also the payments.
00:11:22.730 - 00:11:53.434, Speaker B: We want users to have, or developers to have whatever financial relationships they want, whether that be on chain or off. We don't want to get involved with that. And so we are launching with decentralized publishing. This is permissionless on chain publishing of applications where anyone can use our tools to put their applications on the chain and then submit them to us for review. I do want to make that distinction. Like I said, users deserve this protection. That's offered by application stores.
00:11:53.434 - 00:12:23.014, Speaker B: But one key difference here is that we're definitely going to be putting our opinion on the Solana mobile store to protect users. But because everything is on chain, the specifications are open. Anyone could go and consume this same application data, which is like screenshots. It's the icons, even the apks themselves. If they wanted to deliver it differently, they're free to do so. We want to encourage that, but we also want to protect our users. And so that's our vision of the Solana Dapp store.
00:12:23.014 - 00:12:53.018, Speaker B: Submissions are open now. In fact, they opened up about three, maybe four weeks ago now. So get your dapps ready. If you have a Dap that's either already ready or nearly ready, if you get that submitted by early March, we'll have time to review it and make sure that it can be in the Dapp store on day one. Don't worry though, I know that that's not that many weeks away. Not that I've been counting how many weeks, but still not that many weeks away. Please go ahead and submit.
00:12:53.018 - 00:13:18.294, Speaker B: We're not closing. We're going to keep reviewing the applications as rapidly as they come in and keeping our catalog up to date and fresh. So the Dapp store is. The catalog is live. We want your submissions. We want to make this the best place to find web3 applications. And speaking of web3 applications, we've talked about the Dappstore, but now let's actually talk about building applications themselves.
00:13:18.294 - 00:14:04.404, Speaker B: The primary technology in SMS that will enable this is the mobile wallet adapter, which is really all about enabling some of these mobile experiences by connecting wallets and apps. But with a definitely mobile twist, we designed it from the ground up for mobile, mobile users. On the desktop, there tends to be just one language. You have JavaScript on the web, where web apps are developed on mobile devices, the landscape is much broader. We have native applications, Java and Kotlin. We have cross platform frameworks like React, native Dart and flutter, gaming platforms like Unreal Engine Unity, for example, and the web platform. And we want to enable all of those.
00:14:04.404 - 00:14:42.424, Speaker B: So all of these frameworks that I just listed out are either available now or in development with the mobile wallet adapter. So it's live today on any Android device, not just saga, everything I just said is built on open technologies web dapps. There's a bunch live. If you use wallet adapter in your applications, it's probably live now. You might even be surprised if you just test it with Phantom or soulflare. On a mobile device, you'll probably see an Android system disambiguation dialogue. Pop up from the bottom and you can actually choose your wallets and see it working live on a mobile device.
00:14:42.424 - 00:15:15.156, Speaker B: So I am thrilled for this. This is going to be the thing that enables crypto and web3 on mobile devices. I'd love to say it's launching first with Saga, but even better, it's already live. You can use it today. So rather than talk about it, I'd actually rather show you. So this is an application that my team has developed called Minty Fresh. And it really started off from a conversation of what can phones do? Well, they're there.
00:15:15.156 - 00:15:46.026, Speaker B: They're all the themes I talked about before. Pervasive computing, asynchronous notifications. But what can it do for a user? Why can't I mint an NFT, make a memory and put it on chain in just seconds? And so we've built Minty fresh. I'd love to show it to you. So here we're going to launch Minty Fresh. Pick a photo from our awesome collection. We'll just go ahead and give it a title, we'll fill out a description for it, and as soon as we hit the mint button, we launch right into the wallet that was mobile wallet adapter.
00:15:46.026 - 00:16:01.754, Speaker B: We're going to sign a message here, upload the file to ipfs. We're going to actually sign the mint transaction itself. If you look carefully, you would have seen our seed vault in there. And there we go. That's it. We've minted it's on chain in a second. Here, you can see it come up live.
00:16:01.754 - 00:16:21.034, Speaker B: There we go. We'll tap on that. Here's the details. And you can of course see it in minty fresh, but you can also go straight to soulflare. We're going to jump over to our collectibles tab and just give it 1 second to load. There it is. That was minting from scratch all the way to on chain.
00:16:21.034 - 00:16:47.454, Speaker B: And I know it was fast, so if anyone wants me to play it again, just raise your hand and actually I'm going to. If I could, I'm going to take a quick photo here because right after this, people can find me over there. I'm going to mint a photo live of this gathering. Sun. Sun. Yeah. Everyone smile and wave.
00:16:47.454 - 00:17:06.404, Speaker B: Take a few just to make sure at least one of them comes out. Great. Yes, yes, please. I'll do a demo afterwards. But anyone who wants to mint more, let's do it. We'll mint a whole bunch. Yes.
00:17:06.404 - 00:17:44.817, Speaker B: So minty fresh. This is our vision of taking your memories and capturing them on chain in seconds, anyone can be a creator. We've open sourced this. We think this is such a great example of the user experience of what dapps and how people should use mobile for web3 that we hit the button. Earlier today, my colleague Ankur officially hit the make public button. It's on our GitHub now. And we're going to have a consumer ready version of this exclusively available in the salon adapt store at launch.
00:17:44.817 - 00:18:16.634, Speaker B: So I want to see all kinds of photos. I want to see as creative as people can be. Mint away. I'm looking forward to seeing what everyone does with minty fresh. So, like I said, mobile wallet adapter is ready and it's ready to start building now. Lfg. Awesome.
00:18:16.634 - 00:18:31.354, Speaker B: And with that, I'm also extremely excited that we have two great partners in the Solana ecosystem who both have a strong presence here in Australia joining us today. And to kick it off, I'd like to welcome Sydney and Tiff from Magic Eaton.
00:18:38.984 - 00:18:47.072, Speaker C: They say we should have worn, like, black turtlenecks and, like. Anyway, I hope everyone's doing well. You want to introduce yourself quickly?
00:18:47.168 - 00:19:03.416, Speaker D: Yeah. So, my name is Sydney. I'm one of the co founders and city of Madrid and Melbourne raised. Not born, but Melbourne raised. And, yeah, and, yeah, grew up in Glen Waverly here. If anyone's from Glenwood. No one.
00:19:03.480 - 00:19:04.164, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:19:05.184 - 00:19:09.806, Speaker D: And, yeah. So, yeah. Really happy to be here today. Yeah.
00:19:09.990 - 00:19:22.902, Speaker C: Cool. I lead marketing at Magic Eden and we have a bunch of other magic Eden people floating around, so feel free to come and say hi. There's probably, like, ten of us here anyway, so we'll probably whip through these slides pretty quickly. Oh, a little formatting.
00:19:22.998 - 00:19:24.314, Speaker A: It's fine, whatever.
00:19:25.014 - 00:19:27.854, Speaker C: So, I guess, yeah. You want to introduce us and go through?
00:19:27.894 - 00:20:05.464, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So, yeah. Who are we? So imagine with the largest dapp on Solana, and we are probably, probably one of the largest apps in the world. If not, the largest will be the second largest. And one thing that's really relevant for today is actually more than half of our traffic comes on mobile. And with very, very strong conversion on mobile. Mobile has always been, I would say, a channel that has been really, really important for us.
00:20:05.464 - 00:20:44.114, Speaker D: We believe that the future NFT and the future of consumer experiences on crypto is clearly going to be mobile. Beyond that, we really care about. People should be able to go to the gym, go to dinner, and not have to stay at home all day in order to just mint, which is something that we hear a lot from our users. About. And lastly, a secure web3 friendly ecosystem for both creators and collectors alike, which actually is not necessarily true today on mobile.
00:20:44.974 - 00:20:45.566, Speaker A: Cool.
00:20:45.670 - 00:21:08.754, Speaker C: So I think we're really proud of the progress that we've been able to make over the last year and a half. So if there's really one word, I think that really summarizes my Magic Eden, it's definitely engagement. So we're the largest app on Solana. We've minted a ton of over nearly 2 million nfts to date, have over 1.5 million daily user sessions. And then a couple of my favorite stats. The average user session on magic heat in is actually 15 minutes.
00:21:08.754 - 00:21:54.304, Speaker C: The average user session on TikTok is actually eleven, less than eleven minutes. And so people are looking at magic heat. And I think a lot of the reasons behind this really long user session is actually due to Solana and the scalability of the chain, as well as just like, how quick the market moves. Right, because of how affordable the nfts are. And so because of all of this context, magic Enon has found an incredible stickiness and we're really proud to call Solana home. Also, kind of in the same vein, we had, over 2022, processed 217 million transactions, which is actually ten times that of OpenSeA, if you look at it. According to, to Dapradar, 20,000 creators call us home, and we've raised over 114 million over the course of 2020.
00:21:54.304 - 00:22:30.904, Speaker C: Two's launchpad revenue. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Yeah, so taking that level of engagement and bringing that to mobile is something we're really, really excited about. I cover this slide, too. So what's kind of crazy is that it's actually more than half 60% of Magic Eden user sessions happen on mobile versus desktop. If you just look at from early December until now, all around the world, and that number actually fluctuates a lot based on different countries. So Indonesia is actually one of the larger markets for Magic Eden, and that number actually shoots up to well over 70%.
00:22:30.904 - 00:22:50.904, Speaker C: So we currently have an iPhone and Android app that's browsing only. And right now, the only way for you to mint and trade nfts on Magic Eden on mobile is via, like, the web app within the Phantom mobile app. Has anybody. Yeah, I see some djen in the house. So. Yeah. And the conversion rate on Mobile Safari is actually 30% higher than desktop Chrome.
00:22:50.904 - 00:22:53.960, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's, like, just real potential here.
00:22:54.112 - 00:22:55.044, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:22:55.424 - 00:23:26.356, Speaker C: However, the fact is that there are mobile shortcomings and that forces people to have trade offs that shouldn't actually exist. So we did a search and found people who tagged magic Eden and wrote the word gym. And you can see people. People are like, oh, I want to get a workout in, but I guess I want to look at nfts instead. And I can't wait for Elon Musk's neuralink to connect me to magic Eden, opensea, whoever they are. But anyway, so, yeah, I guess, sid, why don't you take this slide? And then we'll kind of share. We'll kind of just speak more openly about, like, what our plans are moving into the future.
00:23:26.460 - 00:23:58.954, Speaker D: I mean, today, it's very difficult to degen and touch grass at the same time. And so I think that maybe there are two things that stand out about saga. One is security, and the second is, I would say, friendliness. And so, like, I think, let's start with friendliness, right? Like, so I don't know if anyone has anyone. Like, does anyone follow Apple App Store policy? Apple actually recently, like, clarified. I mean, yeah, the person that works is like.
00:24:09.484 - 00:24:10.692, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
00:24:10.868 - 00:24:11.844, Speaker D: Oh, my God.
00:24:11.884 - 00:24:13.276, Speaker C: The enemy is in the room.
00:24:13.420 - 00:25:11.170, Speaker D: Yeah. So, like, I mean, Apple used to be. Used to have a very, I would say, ambiguous policy when it comes to NFT. And, like, and about three, four months ago, they aggressively clarify. And so if anyone actually follows the policies, you know, and that basically kind of, like, you know, like, definitively kind of, you know, it's, like, very definitive now. And the other thing is that, like, you know, the 30% fee, it applies to all the primary transactions, which is me, and, you know, but it also applies to all secondary transactions, including, like, p two P trading. So, like, if I bought something from, let's say, I minted NFT on an app published in the Apple App Store, I pay 30% of that.
00:25:11.170 - 00:25:53.896, Speaker D: And when I sell it and someone buys it, then that's another 30%. And, of course, you can only go through in app purchase, which means that you can't even pay through crypto. You have to pay through credit card, which then the platform then somehow transforms credit card into a Solana transaction, give the energy to you, and then. And then 30% of that goes to Apple, which, you know, so completely unworkable. Um, you know, I think that the other thing that's beyond that, we certainly have a lot of friends who build wallets, and. And I think one thing that is really. That really stands out about saga being extremely critical forward is the way that Sigvo works.
00:25:53.896 - 00:26:32.412, Speaker D: So, on Apple, as well as all Android devices. Yes, you can store the keys inside enclave. But basically it's accessible by the operating system. It's accessible the app. I don't know if you guys remember the wallet exploit of earlier this year where everybody is freaked out. And that's actually when you have a bug in the app. If you have a supply chain attack in the app, in the wallet app, that can happen.
00:26:32.412 - 00:27:17.980, Speaker D: But on something like saga, it's actually impossible to get hacked. Entire class of the most severe attack vectors is just completely not there anymore. And that has immense implications for app developers because no app developers want to actually touch the key. And now that saga handles that for the app developer, the app developer can just focus building the app and not have to worry about key leak risk, which will end the company overnight. And, you know, so of course then, you know, you compare the saga. It's like there's no 30% fee, it's web3 friendly. Anyone can publish the dapp.
00:27:17.980 - 00:27:46.680, Speaker D: And the most importantly, hardware backs it phrase storage on mobile, which is absolutely amazing. Well, not just like hardware backsafraid storage, it's hardware signing as well, which means that the app never has access to that. The sip phrase, you can have a bug in it and you're not going to lose the key. And. Yeah, so I think that all of these things are extremely exciting. It's clearly where the world's moving towards, and Apple and Google Play store better pay some attention.
00:27:46.792 - 00:27:47.112, Speaker B: Cool.
00:27:47.168 - 00:27:50.376, Speaker C: So what are we doing? Let's tell the people what we're working on.
00:27:50.440 - 00:28:29.396, Speaker D: Yeah, so we are working on an app for the app. The App Store. And I think we're going to also continuously invest further into the mobile experience. Right now we have a fairly minimal browsing experience and we're going to double down on that browsing experience for Apple and Google stores and then combine that with a purchasing experience that's going to be unique to saga because it's only actually possible here. So anyway, so, yeah, awesome.
00:28:29.460 - 00:28:37.024, Speaker C: Well, we look forward to the Q and a section, but yeah, we're really excited to support Saga for their launch. And yeah, look forward to a magic eating app.
00:28:37.964 - 00:28:38.904, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:28:48.164 - 00:29:18.914, Speaker B: Thank you, Sid. Thank you, Tiffany. Personally, I cannot wait to see that vision realized on saga first. But Android everywhere. So like I said, NFTs are a fantastic use case for mobile and I cannot wait to see it delivered to its full potential. I would also like to welcome up drift protocol, a perpetuals exchange built on Solana, and they've been building for over two years now. And so I'd like to invite Cindy to join us, talk a little bit about their thoughts on mobile.
00:29:25.894 - 00:29:26.790, Speaker A: Hello everyone.
00:29:26.902 - 00:29:45.194, Speaker E: It's nice to be here today. It's my first time in Melbourne, even though half of our team is from here. So I want to give a quick shout out before we start to all the drifties out here. There's a bunch of us, so I'm sure you've already talked to them. Please raise your hand if you're a drifter. There's a lot of you.
00:29:45.774 - 00:29:46.594, Speaker A: Cool.
00:29:47.014 - 00:30:23.632, Speaker E: So it's kind of hard coming up here after so many heavy hitters. Thank you guys for a great presentation, but I'll try my best today to talk about, from the perspective of a defi protocol, what mobile means for us, what our roadmap is, and why we're excited about saga. So quick intro about drift. If this is the first time you're hearing about us, we are leading derivative stacks on Solana largest perp exchange. We've been live for about a year now. We just launched our v two, which is currently live on drift trade. If you fancy giving it a swing.
00:30:23.632 - 00:31:00.264, Speaker E: We have ten x leverage on perps and yeah, if you're feeling like a quick trade, go ahead and try it out. I'll quickly talk about what features we're excited about. And we've shipped in v two. We've got perpetual swaps yield. You can basically deposit funds and earn a magical amount of money without doing anything. So not financial advice, but it just accrues in your wallet over time without you doing anything. And the other thing is you can also use the same funds on the exchange to leverage against by borrowing.
00:31:00.264 - 00:31:39.186, Speaker E: If you have USCC, you can borrow solar, et cetera, express many views in the market. And lastly, this is a feature I'm really excited about. We have spot on the same exchange as well. So you can essentially switch between futures trading and spot depending on what you're comfortable with, without needing to move your funds anywhere. So what is our grand vision? Why are we actually doing this? We care a lot about the decentralized space. This is why we're here today. We've seen many centralized exchanges blow up over the last year, and we believe that the future of Defi trading really is on Solana.
00:31:39.186 - 00:32:03.914, Speaker E: And we believe that no matter kind of what kind of trader you are, we want to build an environment where you can actually have a better experience than a centralized exchange on chain. And how do we actually do this? Robinhood, let's say, has 50 million users to date. Binance has maybe 20 million. Any guesses on how many users there are in DeFi today.
00:32:05.294 - 00:32:05.942, Speaker B: Twelve.
00:32:06.078 - 00:33:06.344, Speaker E: Yes, exactly, twelve. Well, it's a little closer to the 50,000 range, so we've got a long way to go to get to Robinhood's level and we think that the missing piece between where we are now and where we can be, which is, you know, Robin Hood and beyond, of course, is mobile. But why haven't we built a solid enough mobile experience yet? The tools haven't existed for us to actually have the seed vault together. The only mobile experience you have today is clicking on phantom and then having a little pop up on your screen where you can click trade perps. It's ok, but it's pretty clunky. So our vision and why we're doing this today is to essentially get us to a place where users can download an app on their phone and natively be able to trade perps without thinking about, hey, I need to download a wallet and to move some funds here from my desktop and then.
00:33:08.044 - 00:33:08.824, Speaker B: Cool.
00:33:09.484 - 00:33:55.354, Speaker E: So to go further into why mobile is important to us, we want to quickly talk about what users have been seeing so far. One pretty crazy stat is that, and I just found this out a couple of weeks ago, that 42% of our sessions actually happen on mobile and we spend a lot of time developing on desktop, but users have typically much better retention on mobile and are increasingly spending more time on mobile. I think this number went up from 30% to 40% in the last month. So we're seeing the trend that more and more traders are, you know, just want to trade on the go. This is probably a result of the current market conditions as well. The market is going up. Your friends are telling you to ape something.
00:33:55.354 - 00:34:42.545, Speaker E: You know, you can just, like, whip out your app and be able to trade. You're not going to run home and, like, put on a leverage position. Right. And the interesting thing here is that most of the mobile sessions are above two minutes, which is telling us that people are spending a pretty sustained amount of time not just checking their positions or checking charts, they're actually thinking about what traits they want to do, how they're going to trade the market, et cetera. And probably the craziest thing about this, there's been a lot of crazy things so far, is that over 10% are spending an hour or over an hour on the app, just browsing around, not sure what they're doing in that hour. Yeah, trading. Yeah.
00:34:42.545 - 00:35:36.950, Speaker E: Going in and out of positions. But this is telling us that we need to take mobile a lot more seriously and put it as a key part of our roadmap this year. So the biggest question that's been coming up on our discord this year is Wen mobile. Shout out to Raj for compiling all this crazy stats from my users. Everyone's been just asking when mobile went mobile. And yeah, the main ask here has just been a portable training experience that they can bring around anywhere without having to be trained to a desk, essentially. And essentially, looking back on Saga, we're thinking that the main thing why we like Saga is really, it would be pretty much impossible for us to get close to being listed on the App Store.
00:35:36.950 - 00:36:14.642, Speaker E: That would be a year long effort. And honestly, paying 30% per trade hits traders really hard. Nobody wants to give up a third of their profits. Honestly, the security, the censorship resistance of saga makes it a really interesting play for Defi. And now I'll quickly walk through the platform and show you. The animation was a bit clunky, but I'll walk through the platform and show you what you can do with mobile. So this is what the trading interface looks like.
00:36:14.642 - 00:37:01.718, Speaker E: You can scroll between a chart, the order book and the trade form all in one. It makes it really easy for you to get a sense of what the market's feeling is everyone going long or short and then take a trade. And this is the feature that we're really excited about as well. A lot of people use take trades on desktop, leave the desktop, and then come on mobile and then see how their position is doing. And we're finding that a lot of users on mobile are actually primarily using this feature of checking positions and just generally seeing what they're doing, whether they need to add a stop loss or take profit. All that magic happens here. And again with the magical yield.
00:37:01.718 - 00:37:37.818, Speaker E: Now you can have that on your phone without needing to sign in on your chrome. You can essentially deposit funds and earn yield straight away on your mobile app. So, just a quick recap of everything and what our plans are. We have a prototype of mobile live right now. You can test it out on Phantom, go on app drift trade, and that's more of a clunky version that we have. It still works and it works great. But our strategy moving forward and where we want to be is essentially having a native mobile app directly live on Saga.
00:37:37.818 - 00:37:55.124, Speaker E: And yeah, we're really looking forward to seeing that play out this year. This is coming out really soon, so we're working very hard to make that a reality for every degen out there. This is a great tagline, by the way.
00:38:02.144 - 00:38:27.784, Speaker B: Thank you, Cindy. And as soon as that is available in the salon adapt store. I will definitely be downloading it. So I'm excited with that. Just to close out solanomobile.com dot. I know my animations earlier were absolutely terrible, but please still do go and pre order your saga now that you can pre order it in the Australia New Zealand markets.
00:38:27.784 - 00:38:52.712, Speaker B: We're going to do a quick demo after this. That photo I took, I'm going to mint it live over there because nothing ever goes wrong with a live demo. So we'll have some fun with that. We'll have some sagas set up on the table over here as well. We've got some Devnet funds loaded on those and you can try out minty fresh yourself. And yeah, we'll be a couple members from my team as well. We have Ankur and Laura and we'll be mingling.
00:38:52.712 - 00:39:08.564, Speaker B: Please come find us, ask us some questions. We're happy to talk about saga and SMS, but before we get into that, we are going to do a little bit of Q and A as well. And so I'd like to invite my co presenters back to the stage and we're happy to take some questions. Thank you.
00:39:14.984 - 00:39:59.154, Speaker A: For tiff tippy wired again. All right, take a seat. I'll sit in the middle. All right. Okay, so I'll just get started with one question. So while everybody think about their questions, and this is more of a personal and selfish question I wanted to pose to all three of you. So other than the things that you guys currently work on for your job, what other mobile web3 dapps that you want to see build that will make your life better?
00:40:01.634 - 00:40:18.614, Speaker E: Well, I think during the hacker house, probably made my first Solana paid transaction at the coffee stand. I thought that was really, really fun. And I was like, okay, I can probably just go around without my credit card then. That's probably an over exaggeration, but I'm really looking forward to getting more adopted.
00:40:19.354 - 00:40:21.858, Speaker A: Nice. Stephen.
00:40:21.986 - 00:40:45.574, Speaker B: Well, up until I showed that video, I would have said I want to be able to mint in like 10 seconds from my phone. But now that we can do that, and it's a reality, I'm actually very much in line with that. But the NFC, I want to take my phone and I want to tap it on things and I want to hear it go beep, because the beep is very satisfying. And after it goes beep, I want it to come right off the chain. So that's my vision. Beep. Done.
00:40:46.874 - 00:40:49.266, Speaker A: Nice. And then, Ted?
00:40:49.410 - 00:41:24.134, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm pretty interested in content and social interactions that are tracked back to the wallet as opposed to like a web two identity. And so like, for example, I'm a huge fan of dialect and feel like, you know, those types of apps where you, with the benefit of having a wallet, you can actually do transactions via a more social way instead of like having to go to a website to trade. I guess. I'm still talking about nfts. Sorry, I'm not supposed to do that. But yeah, I guess having, having your identity and the wallet id and having social applications based off of that would be cool.
00:41:24.474 - 00:41:26.258, Speaker A: Yeah, also really cool.
00:41:26.386 - 00:41:28.574, Speaker B: Awesome. And Laura, what would be yours?
00:41:30.874 - 00:42:09.034, Speaker A: That was also the minting cam was my longest request for our dev team and they finally got on it. Now that we have that, I think, does everyone remember the game flappy bird? So I want a flappy bird version on chain version of Flappy Bird and utilizes all the sensors that's on the phone. Because right now without a phone, it's not something you can do. Right. So I want someone to build a game on chain that fully utilizes the sensors of the phone and make it really fun and engaging. That's what I want.
00:42:11.474 - 00:42:12.454, Speaker B: Stop it.
00:42:13.474 - 00:42:25.214, Speaker A: All right, so does anyone in the audience have a question? I'll just come down here and hand you the mic. Okay.
00:42:29.074 - 00:42:33.214, Speaker B: Given that the Dapps can publish direct to unchained before they're reviewed by Solana.
00:42:34.434 - 00:42:36.378, Speaker F: Does that mean that only those Dapps.
00:42:36.426 - 00:43:22.606, Speaker B: Once there reviewed by Solana will be in the Dapp store? Or will the phone still be able to interact with other Dapps that are already published on Zhine? Yep. So we've divided our creation of adapt store into publishing, which is permissionless open specifications on GitHub. Right now you can go read about all about those and our curation process where we everyone, once the Dapps are minted, the address is submitted to us and we'll go through a review process. So the Solana Dappstore, we take protecting users extremely seriously. Like for many of these applications, we're talking about users finances. And so the Dapp store itself will only consist of curated content. But it's an open phone.
00:43:22.606 - 00:43:50.274, Speaker B: We want to encourage the fact that this is an Android device. It isn't the iOS, where everything is a lockdown walled garden. We don't take away anything from Android. And we do encourage users or developers to build out these differentiated experiences like adaptor, that might have slightly different policies, maybe a little bit more bleeding edge, or more types of experiences, and distribute those for the phone, I think it's the perfect place for it.
00:43:55.454 - 00:44:03.984, Speaker D: When you say that when application is minted on chain application. You mean the binary is put on chain?
00:44:04.644 - 00:44:33.660, Speaker B: So that is up to the developer. By default, we publish the apks to Arweave. And so we're working on more plugins, more storage plugins. We want to have Shadow drive from Genesis up there. We want to have even an Amazon s three bucket. We don't care where the user publishes, we just want them to be able to publish their app, the metadata for their app on chain so that we can consume it. And anyone else who wants to, can consume it as well.
00:44:33.660 - 00:44:34.584, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:44:36.804 - 00:44:38.504, Speaker A: Anyone else in the audience?
00:44:40.284 - 00:45:18.950, Speaker F: Yeah, I think the world has been waiting for a good integration of a mobile wallet, a hardware wallet, sorry, in a mobile phone, to be able to make this possible. I think I might have missed it because it happened so fast in your minty fresh demo. But this is a hypothetical, say if I took a Minty fresh app and I forked it to submit a malicious transaction, which, instead of minting an NFT, would drain your wallet, is that prevented by the curation process, or does the wallet adapter present some sort of transaction data on what is actually going on behind the scenes?
00:45:19.062 - 00:45:54.012, Speaker B: Yep. So there's two defenses at play here, and one of them isn't even new. With Saga, wallets are still the gateway to your seed vault on the device. And so in the demo we showed on the screen I was using solflare, it's also integrated into Phantom. The Exodus wallet is currently integrating mobile wallet adapter, so, and there's a couple others who are exploring it as well. Wallets are still that first line of protection for a user. Just like when you connect to a wallet on your desktop browser, you get transaction simulation results or some other kind of introspection into it.
00:45:54.012 - 00:46:20.544, Speaker B: You'll still get the same thing on Saga. The addition on Saga of seed vault is protecting the keys itself. It's the boring custody layer that lives even below the wallets. The other side of that, yes, you mentioned curation. We will absolutely be on the lookout for malicious use cases and checking applications to the greatest extent possible to make sure our catalog is safe.
00:46:22.884 - 00:46:27.144, Speaker D: Am I going to be able to use an external hardware wallet with Saga?
00:46:27.924 - 00:46:59.374, Speaker B: So the wallet applications are still the user's front end. They're how users are still going to experience their assets on the device, experience their accounts. And so we would never take a position with this phone where, like, you couldn't have other ways of custody available to you. So we've built seed vault, which we think is an amazing balance of the usability combined with the security. But if you want to use a ledger, pick a wallet from the Dapp store, install it, and if it supports ledger, you can absolutely do that.
00:47:00.274 - 00:47:19.814, Speaker A: I want to ask the next question. Question to both of you. So, both of you, your projects are working on the Dapp for the Solana Solana Dapp store. How do you see going mobile as a competitive advantage for your respective businesses?
00:47:20.554 - 00:47:57.764, Speaker E: That's a great question. And I think that given kind of the state of Defi on other chains, and if you look at other chains, there's nowhere close to a mobile experience at all. Right. So being mobile, native and mobile first actually gives us a huge advantage over players who are. Who don't have this ability to build out a native mobile app. I think getting there faster enables us to access a different class of users that a pure desktop only apply wouldn't. So we're really excited about that particular piece.
00:47:58.744 - 00:48:54.056, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's just, for us, it's like, way more user acquisition, because I think right now, nfts require a lot of emotional and time investment, and you just can't. You have to make, like, real lifestyle sacrifices. I think for us to go mobile means we get to address it. Markets outside of, like, the US and Australia, we get to tap into a lot of markets that are actually just mobile first to begin with. We get to also acquire users who are maybe not as tech savvy and just want to have a mobile first experience. And I think we get to grow our services, both across secondaries and primaries exponentially, because people will just be able to mint on the fly, or maybe minting itself will not be, like, this big thing. On Magic Eden right now, we have a launchpad and we carefully curate every collection.
00:48:54.056 - 00:49:13.364, Speaker C: But the barrier to create can go down exponentially, so that there can just be more creation, period, on Magic Eden and different types of creator products, some of which can be only mobile. And then on secondaries, it'll just be way easier to transact on nfts. So, yeah, just way higher conversion rates and way more user acquisition.
00:49:14.244 - 00:49:15.468, Speaker A: No, 30% fees.
00:49:15.516 - 00:49:16.012, Speaker B: Right?
00:49:16.148 - 00:49:16.904, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:17.524 - 00:49:22.184, Speaker A: So we're gonna take more audience questions, if you have any.
00:49:27.764 - 00:50:14.192, Speaker B: Obviously, I'm a big fan of what you guys doing. I already ordered five. Five phones. Can you give us non financial advice of price prediction of the Saga phone? What's the future flow price going to be? How can you make it more newbie friendly? So Saga is our first foray into this space, and we're learning, we're exploring. I come from a long background of mobile. I've been doing it for almost 20 years now, but this is the first time I've done a project quite like this. And so with Saga, we're launching it as a flagship and we're launching it for everyone here, all the developers, all the dgen users out there.
00:50:14.192 - 00:50:36.324, Speaker B: We want people to love this phone. We'll see where this takes us next. This first device is 1000 USDC, certainly on the higher end of phone prices, but it also comes with really high end specs. It has twelve gigs of ram, 512 gigs of flash. It's a 6.67 inch oled display. Like, these are top of the line specs that come along with it.
00:50:36.324 - 00:50:55.364, Speaker B: We'll be keenly watching where the interest lies and make some decisions from there. When other Solana mobile users message you, are they going to get a special text message from customers?
00:50:56.664 - 00:51:00.314, Speaker A: Purple bubbles. So dialect.
00:51:03.294 - 00:51:14.834, Speaker B: So we want. No, you can, although find me later, maybe after I have a drink at the bar, you can talk me into it. But no.
00:51:20.614 - 00:51:41.854, Speaker F: I've got like a two part question. So part one, as this is a gen one device, what do you guys see as your total obtainable market for the device? So we can try and gauge what our kind of user base might be. And part two would be, what's Solana mobile doing to help mitigate the financial risks to companies building on the ecosystem to incentivize that?
00:51:43.914 - 00:52:53.912, Speaker B: So, for the idea of a total addressable market, we've spoken a few times publicly about what we would view as success within the first six to twelve months for this device. And so we think our goal here is to show that there is product market fit, that we should be building this, not because we want to, but because the market demands it. And that if I can create competition in this space, if I can stimulate other manufacturers, say, yes, there's a demand, we should be building this, then I've done my job. So we think that if we could hit 50,000 units within those first, maybe six to twelve months, then we have demonstrated why this matters. And so I will make and sell as many of these devices as I possibly can. But having you know that is our North Star, is find that product market fit, prove how much demand there is for something like this in the ecosystem. Sorry, could you repeat part two? I'm glad you asked that.
00:52:53.912 - 00:53:30.664, Speaker B: I completely forgot to mention it. At the end of the presentation, we have a Solana mobile grant program, and so you can go to solanamobile.com. There's a link in the upper right corner for grant and you just fill out a few basic details about what you want to build, and it can be whether it's an open source project, whether it's a public good like SDKs or infrastructure, or a novel use case, bringing some of these SMS specific features in a way that doesn't yet exist in our Dapp store. We want your submissions for that. So fill that out, send it in. Myself and a team of my colleagues review those grant submissions.
00:53:31.204 - 00:53:39.466, Speaker A: We'll take one more question, because the phone's already sitting out there. I know you guys can all want to take a look, so you will be the last question.
00:53:39.610 - 00:53:39.994, Speaker B: Okay.
00:53:40.034 - 00:53:42.774, Speaker D: Will Saga run validator software in the future?
00:53:43.874 - 00:54:16.664, Speaker B: So, validator software on mobile devices is a super interesting use case because it goes directly against one of the core principles of mobile, which is preserve the battery life. First and foremost, this is not a second phone. We don't want people to have an iPhone in their pocket. And Saga, this is the only phone I carry. And the intention of what we're building is this is a great phone, full stop, amazing Android device. And it just does the things that would be unique to Saga now, but hopefully in the future won't be unique anymore. All phones will do these things.
00:54:16.664 - 00:54:42.984, Speaker B: It's an open platform. Anyone could just build the validator software and deploy it to their Android device, but they would be taking on the. The burden of that, which is compute, Ram, and ultimately the battery life consumption of it. So please create that use case. We'd love to have that brought to the Dapp store, but directly running a validator, like out of the box on the phone, is not one of the target use cases that we're targeting with Saga.
00:54:44.804 - 00:55:11.886, Speaker A: Well, thank you, everyone. So for the rest of the evening, Stephen's gonna be here minting that photo that we just took earlier. We might, if he's in the mood, he might take a couple more selfies with everybody, and we'll mend them on chain on our Twitter. We'll publish the soul scan later. And then we also have devices. The devices are loaded with a minty fresh apk. It's on Devnet.
00:55:11.886 - 00:55:24.604, Speaker A: So you can test the app, but it just won't stay on Solana Mainnet, but you can test out the experience and the use case. Thank you, everybody.
00:55:28.624 - 00:55:39.904, Speaker B: And I want to especially thank our partners, Drift and magic Eden, for joining us here today. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today as well.
