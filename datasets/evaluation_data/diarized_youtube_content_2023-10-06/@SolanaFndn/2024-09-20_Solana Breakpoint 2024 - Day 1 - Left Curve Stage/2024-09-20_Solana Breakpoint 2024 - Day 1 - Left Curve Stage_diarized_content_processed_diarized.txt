00:03:21.845 - 00:03:55.983, Speaker A: We are a small place. They can put the screws on us. It's not so easy today. This is our modern city. Ten years from now, this will be a metropolis. Even if you are going to lure me into the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I'll get out. And because the people supported us, therefore we succeeded.
00:03:55.983 - 00:04:43.881, Speaker A: It just wasn't guts on our part. It was guts on our part. Of our total population, a total population refused to be cowed. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hello.
00:04:43.881 - 00:04:56.465, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. My name is Cash Donda. I'm the Sherpa of Super Team. I'm Lily. I'm a public servant from the Solana foundation. And we are thrilled to welcome you to the biggest Break Point ever.
00:04:56.465 - 00:05:36.001, Speaker A: Folks, make some noise for Breakpoint 2024. Yeah, we sold more than 6,000 tickets, have more than 114 countries represented, and have what feels like 76,000 different side events over this weekend. It is going to be two days worth remembering, I think over the next 15 minutes or so. What we want to do is talk about how Solana is different and how that's reflected in everything that you see in Breakpoint 2024. This is also our first Breakpoint in Asia because Solana is global. Let's get a shout out who flew more than 10 hours to get here. Amazing.
00:05:36.001 - 00:06:26.255, Speaker A: Welcome, as we say in Chinese, meaning it's a pleasure to gather our good friends from around the world. Cash, anything in Hindi from you? I only know one word in Hindi and it starts with the hin, and we're not going to say it here, so let's move right along. Okay, let's move on. The idea for Solana started on a little beach in California. Today, Solana's validators, developers and users are in basically every country in the world. And Asia is leading the way. 40% of our users, 50% of developers in the last hackathon, and as has been true from the start of crypto time, 70% of global liquidity originates here in Asia.
00:06:26.255 - 00:06:51.949, Speaker A: It's pretty incredible. But underlying all of these users, these developers, this liquidity, is Solana the network. It really is. As the cliche goes, all about the tech. Solana itself started with a somewhat radical idea that the network should actually continuously get better. And that's what we're going to talk about at Breakpoint over the next few days. And validators are, of course, the backbone of the network.
00:06:51.949 - 00:07:32.053, Speaker A: Today we've got almost 1400 validators. This year alone, there's been $385 million of fees collected for validators. And in front from Genesis, 37 billion validated transactions, not including vote transactions. And for anyone who's counting, this year, we've validated four times the transactions of all EVM chains combined. So, Lily, you're saying size matters, and Solana is bigger, and it's getting even bigger going forward. And I think this is really the key point of Breakpoint. We have some performance, but it's not enough to have performance.
00:07:32.053 - 00:07:51.869, Speaker A: It's about performance and progress. And so over the next two days, we're going to hear from a bunch of teams that are making the network better. We have Syndica and Jito with their alternative validator clients, and this little team. What are they called? Fire Dancer. Has anyone here heard of Fire Dancer? People excited about Fire Dancer. All right, some Kevin F and Bowers fans in the audience. That's good to see.
00:07:51.869 - 00:08:36.145, Speaker A: These teams are chewing a ludicrous amount of glass to make sure that the network becomes more resilient over time. But it's not just happening on the validator side. We're seeing other improvements to the network that allow us to scale beyond just transactions per second so that builders can actually create new value in the world. So you're going to hear about ZK compression, which brings down the cost of state by a thousand times. You're going to hear about token extensions which allow institutions like PayPal and PyUSD to come on chain when they could not have before. And we're going to hear about actions and blinks which allow developers a new go to market avenue in places that were previously cut off from them, like Twitter, Reddit, YouTube and many others. So constant innovation is critical because fundamentally, Solana is infrastructure for applications.
00:08:36.145 - 00:09:06.323, Speaker A: We're not infrastructure for infrastructure. We're not building a bridge on top of a road on top of a tunnel. That's not what we mean by composition, visibility. Ultimately, the network gets used when you have applications. And Solana is production ready today. It's one of my favorite things about Solana, right? We're building for real users, not just for podcasts. Do you have something against podcasts? Didn't Super Team start as a podcast, like the baby of a podcast? Cash, I am a podcast baby.
00:09:06.323 - 00:09:32.926, Speaker A: I do love podcasts. But podcasts don't pay priority fees, right? It's users using real applications that do that. And every team on this slide right here is building towards a future where everyday people can use Solana every single day. And that is why we are trying a new format here at Breakpoint. Product keynotes. You might need 50 minutes on stage to walk through a white paper. But you only need 5 minutes for a product.
00:09:32.926 - 00:10:13.815, Speaker A: 5 slides, 5 minutes show not tell TikTok meet crypto conference we have. This is just a small selection of the talks that you're going to hear. There are 78 lightning product talks happening over the next two days crossing every sector you heal from apps, building in the creator economy, depin gaming and much much more. Ultimately all of these different application spaces need a robust financial layer to thrive. So Solana is building an on chain economy. That's the original vision of Bitcoin where there's an Internet connection, there's a bank account, it's the Internet of money. And Solana's on chain economy is thriving.
00:10:13.815 - 00:11:02.619, Speaker A: We are making the original vision of programmable money real. A strong city needs a strong economy. Self custody means digital property rights, which means on chain financial access for anyone with an Internet connection, which means economics, sovereignty and ultimately self sovereignty. So you're going to hear from a lot of folks in kind of the financial sector who are building out the financial value chain on the asset side, stablecoin, real world asset issuers. Because on chain payments, stablecoins are the lifeblood of the on chain economy. Today you're going to hear about infrastructure for payments and commerce. And from trading venues you're going to hear from some of our most loved defi protocols who are also some of the most used in the entire industry.
00:11:02.619 - 00:11:35.715, Speaker A: And of course from CEFI players as well who are the cornerstone of our industry as well. The salon economy here is where suits and neckbeards bring them together. That's a beautiful thing, I gotta say. But again the spirit here is to show, not just to tell. And so you can actually use Solana Tech outside of just these conferences walls. First, a big shout out to backpack Meteora and straight sex who launched an SGD stablecoin which you can now use using your backpack wallet to pay any merchant inside of Suntec City, inside of this whole convention center. It's pretty cool.
00:11:35.715 - 00:12:08.033, Speaker A: Yeah, right. Real world utility, it's a nice thing. And then outside of the convention center you can actually load up grab with USDC on Solana so that you can pay for rides or food or anything else you need across Singapore. And then beyond that we have Travola where you can actually use usdt, USDC or Seoul to book flights. And as a little special gift for everybody who came early this morning, they're giving $50 to anybody who scans that QR code right now for your next flight. I see some phones Coming out. I'm going to pretend that you are taking photos of me and Lily this whole time.
00:12:08.033 - 00:12:23.895, Speaker A: There you go. All right. You know, imagine this a technology conference where you can actually use the technology. It's a crazy concept. I know. And I'm really excited to see this programmable money and this on chain economy thesis playing out here. Actually, we can't take credit for this.
00:12:23.895 - 00:12:51.131, Speaker A: This is original vision from Satoshi. And thousands of early bitcoiners starting about 15 years ago around the world started talking about it. We're helping to build it, make it real. And hopefully we think Solana can help advance this original vision of bitcoin. I think that's what's great about Solana is that we can build on the shoulders of giants without being precious about the ideology and where it kind of came from. Right. Because fundamentally, Solana is for everybody.
00:12:51.131 - 00:13:00.203, Speaker A: Let's just do a little quick poll here. How many people here kind of started with bitcoin or fans of bitcoin? Make some noise. Yeah. All right. Some bitcoin. How about Ethereum? It's all right. You can say it.
00:13:00.203 - 00:13:13.333, Speaker A: Yeah, a bunch of folks. Yeah, Cosmos. I see some other hands coming up. Yeah. This is great. Right? I know, Lily, you started with bitcoin, I started with Ethereum and that's just fine. But we both ended up building on Solana for one simple reason.
00:13:13.333 - 00:13:30.349, Speaker A: Right. We belong to the tribe of self custody at the end of the day. That's right. We're here to onboard 1 billion people into self custody. I think that's our shared purpose. And Solana is not a place for maximalists. You might even be surprised to know we don't consider ourselves Solana maximalists.
00:13:30.349 - 00:14:01.315, Speaker A: We are Solana rationalists. To bring soft custody to 1 billion people, we've got to enable consumer experiences that are fluid, as you would expect in web 2 for products that can only be built on web 3. And as rationalists, we want to see the best ideas win, which is why I'm super excited about this new format that we're bringing to Breakpoint for the first time ever. Debates, not panels. Right. The goal here is to bring crypto Twitter onto the stage because we've all been to the conferences where the talks are. They're fine, whatever.
00:14:01.315 - 00:14:29.493, Speaker A: But the most interesting arguments are happening over beers or in the hallways. That's the energy that we want to bring on stage this time around and see whichever the best ideas are, let them win, no matter where they come from or who is actually putting them forward. All right, so that's it for the two new formats, debates and product keynotes. A couple of things about the venue itself. This might be your first conference you've been to that has a built in IQ test. So we've got two stages. You're on the left curve stage right now.
00:14:29.493 - 00:15:05.675, Speaker A: It's for markets and business. There's also a right curve stage which is focused on tech and products. Please keep in mind the left curve stage when you come in is on your right and the right curve stage when you come in is on your left. Yeah, and if that is too complicated for you, there's a banking conference down the street which might be more your speed. In between the two stages we have Basecamp, which is another place where you can actually feel Solana for yourself. We have more than 60 teams from around the world demoing their products. So you can feel what is possible on Solana, not just read about it here.
00:15:05.675 - 00:15:30.081, Speaker A: And lastly, Lily, I hear that there's some rumors of BDE this year at Solana Cash. Did you write these slides? What's going on here? Although you are right, Solana does have the best developer energy. So Coliseum's arena is across the way. It's kind of like a hacker house within Breakpoint. That's right. Well, if that feels like a lot of stuff. It is, because it is a lot of stuff.
00:15:30.081 - 00:15:46.355, Speaker A: But don't worry, we got you covered. Everyone in this audience should download this app right now. You can scan this QR code. It'll help you get around. This whole conference is going to move at the speed of Solana, which is great for blockchains and tougher for like IRL conferences. Talks are five minutes. It's going to be easy to miss them.
00:15:46.355 - 00:16:15.933, Speaker A: Right? So you want to make sure you go on there. You can heart the talks that you really want to see and build out your schedule accordingly to get the most out of it. All right, so that's Breakpoint in a nutshell. Before we go, just one last thought. Beyond the tech, the applications on chain economy, ultimately Solana is you. Yeah, I think this is super important to understand, right? Solana is not a GitHub repo or an abstract white paper. It is all of us in this room right now, everybody watching at home as well, is the people putting value into the network.
00:16:15.933 - 00:16:48.637, Speaker A: Right? It is you with the bloody eyes from coding until 3:00 in the morning. It's you with the telegram addiction. It is you arguing about memes around economic security until your family is ready to disown you. I'm looking at you totally over here on that last one. All right, so to borrow from a great leader, a country needs to build up its own core of entrepreneurs. It is not just top leaders, but leaders at all levels. As we say, sometimes internally, the point of decentralization is not the absence of leaders, but the abundance of leaders.
00:16:48.637 - 00:17:33.544, Speaker A: And as I look around into this crowd right now, that is exactly what I see. Let's make this the best break point yet. Thank you very much for coming out, everybody. There we go. Gm, how are you doing? My name is kz. I'm the co founder of Chomp and. Have you guys played Chomp before? Okay, I'm going to hear a lot more of you guys saying yes by the end of this conference.
00:17:33.544 - 00:18:04.965, Speaker A: I'm sure. But enough about me. I was super honored to be sharing a stage with Lily and Cash, both great friends of mine. But if there is an act that can follow this presentation, it's the next ones coming up. Next we have the co founder of Solana foundation, co founder of Solana Raj, having a fireside chat with the founder of Network State biology. We'll have 30 minutes and then we'll set up and then we'll see you soon. Bye.
00:18:04.965 - 00:19:23.481, Speaker A: Hi there. Apologies. We're setting up. In 30 seconds, Balaji and Raj will be coming on stage. In 30 seconds, the CO founder of Solana and the founder of the Network State will be coming on stage. We'll see you sooner. Welcome.
00:19:23.481 - 00:19:41.575, Speaker A: All right, well, we're really far apart. I know. Yeah, we got. It's like Romeo Juliet. All right, thank you so much for coming and thanks everybody for coming to Singapore. If you flew in Baljiana, I know you don't do in person appearances very often. So this is really meaningful.
00:19:41.575 - 00:20:19.915, Speaker A: One of the themes of Breakpoint this year, there are many themes, but one is just be as efficient as possible. We want to be like a firehose of information. So I'm going to skip, you know, Your bio, your PhD Masters Council, earn a 16Z. You're on the Network State now and I know you have a lot to say about the Network school which you're building here nearby in the Singapore area. We'll get to that. What I'd love to start with is what has your experience been? Maybe putting a Network State lens on Solana, the network and the ecosystem. What's your experience been with Solana? Great.
00:20:19.915 - 00:21:01.207, Speaker A: So yeah, the main thing right now is so I think Solana is awesome. I wouldn't be on stage if I didn't think it was awesome. It's Actually useful, which is the highest compliment I can give USDC on solana actually works. Tiplink works for sending NFTs and so on. So I think of Solana as important infrastructure for network states and startup societies because it just means that a lot of stuff we were talking about theoretically for 10 years, and it was kind of possible with high fees or kind of possible, but you had to really hack a smart contract basically just works. And once that goes into infrastructure, you can build on top of it. So I look at Solana as being an important piece, not the only piece, certainly.
00:21:01.207 - 00:21:35.055, Speaker A: I think of, you know, Bitcoin, other things as crucial components as well. But I think of Solana as a crucial piece of infrastructure for the network state. Yeah, well, you know, your. Your definition of decentralization, the way you brought sort of a harder quantified approach to how to. How to measure censorship resistance, has been an important part of the Solana roadmap, so. Well, first of all, thank you for saying all these nice things, but also want to stress that we focused on decentralizing Solana and making sure we deliver that kind of user experience while actually having a censorship resistant network. And a lot of that came from your thinking.
00:21:35.055 - 00:22:30.575, Speaker A: Thank you. Do you have a similar way of sort of quantifying success as a network state? Like if you look at Solana, the ecosystem, the founders, as a network state, how do we define success? Great question. So, on quantifying decentralization, that was a paper from several years ago, and I'll just describe that for those who don't know how that works. So lots of people argue about decentralization as almost a theological concept. Like something is either not decentralized or it's centralized or it's decentralized, but between that 0 and 1, you have many intermediate states, levels of decentralization. And I had this paper from seven years ago that I think is held up reasonably well on looking at all the choke points in a system and saying, how many actors do you need to choke to choke off a system? For example, if you capture three miners or 70 validators, does that compromise the system? And the Nakamoto coefficient is like the minimum number of entities you need to capture to choke point the system. And that's a measure of decentralization.
00:22:30.575 - 00:23:21.699, Speaker A: And so Solana's built, I think, in part on that. Obviously you have a lot of other technological breakthroughs. But to your second question, which is what are the key metrics for a network state? So, you know, everybody here is familiar with CoinMarketCap and market cap and A few other metrics like that have become things that people refresh every day. They're flawed, they're imperfect, but they still are, you know, let's say roughly correlated with the important success of an asset. People talk about top five top ten coins or whatever, fine. So in the same way I think we have started cloud currencies that compete with fiat or land currencies, we are going to start cloud countries that compete with fiat countries. And what are the metrics? It's population, real estate and annual income, which are comparable to the population of a fiat state, the real estate footprint of a fiat state and the annual income.
00:23:21.699 - 00:23:50.551, Speaker A: So the population, annual income, you can think of it. Let's take all Solana holders, for example. You can count their population and you can count their annual income. The part that we haven't really focused on yet is how the cloud takes land. That's the next step for us as a community. How does the cloud take land? And we actually have done this in implicit ways. For example, Facebook's data centers or Google's offices or Solana's validators all around the world are actually taking up significant physical footprint.
00:23:50.551 - 00:24:43.703, Speaker A: If you had some NFT that proved how much real estate there was, for example, you have a surveyor go there and that surveyor sort of is like a notary or an auditor or a proctor of some kind. And they say, okay, this is 50,000 square feet data center or whatever it is, right? And then that's put on chain and you sum up all of those proof of space NFTs that would give you a real estate footprint of a decentralized structure, right? And of course it's not just space, because you could say, all right, maybe this is the built up building and this is the land parcel around it. But there's a whole set of things in real estate that you can do. And you start arguing like you do on market cap. The point is, you start actually now seeing the physical footprint of the Google offices and the Facebook data centers and the Solana data centers. So you see this with Solana too. There are things like Island Dao and Mountain Dow.
00:24:43.703 - 00:25:04.895, Speaker A: There are hacker houses, there are conferences like this. There's over 6,000 people here gathered in Singapore for Breakpoint. What I see is a sort of founder collective of product builders. That's the biggest in person experience that we've been able to create. And now it's sort of out of control. It's not driven by any centralized entity. The thing that binds everyone together is that they're building on Solana.
00:25:04.895 - 00:25:41.031, Speaker A: Do you think it's those spaces that ultimately seek out diplomatic brick? And should we be thinking about like active addresses? And then you mentioned like sole holders, like which, which is the metric. Yeah. So the way I think about it is just like a startup company needs a technical innovation. I think a startup community needs what I call a moral or social innovation. Like you need some feature of your community that you think is better than the establishment and it usually needs to be like one thing. Like, you know, for example, for technology, it's better, it's faster, it's cheaper. Here take for example, cul de sac.
00:25:41.031 - 00:26:03.961, Speaker A: It's saying, okay, they're in Arizona, they're saying, we want a car free society. It's all walkable. Right. Prospera, which is in Honduras, and Vitalia, they want a biotech free zone. Right. So I think what would be, I think you'd have to exercise sort of new muscles which are not the technology muscles, but the community, society, morality, history, controversy muscles. Right.
00:26:03.961 - 00:26:25.401, Speaker A: Where you say society thinks this, I think something different. I'm going to build it on Solana. Right. But Solana up to this point has, it's basically solved all the problems of blockchains better and which is an amazing accomplishment, don't get me wrong. It's really good. Right. But it didn't wade into non blockchain, non technical controversy.
00:26:25.401 - 00:26:49.635, Speaker A: And that's necessarily what a new society will be. Because you're saying, I think we should live like this and most people are living like that. And that'll immediately start an argument in, in a good way because it polarizes. And now these folks say, okay, I do think cars are bad, so I'm moving over here. I do think the FDA is bad, I'm moving over here. So I think that's actually the underlying prerequisite. The technology and the capital and the population is now there.
00:26:49.635 - 00:27:01.801, Speaker A: We just need the moral innovators. Yeah. So features of the way you live, the way you operate daily that are, that are controversial, that are different. Yes. I'll give some examples. Right. So Brian Johnson and I, we've just, we're just setting up the network school.
00:27:01.801 - 00:27:28.707, Speaker A: Right. And one of the things I talk about in the number state book is keto kosher. Right. So as South Asians, you know, we were just talking, you know, we have, we don't metabolize glucose as well, glucose dysregulation. And you know, before my first startup, I was as jacked as an Indian can be, given our physiological limits. And you've, you know, we've We've been, you know, poking each other on this, and you've gotten in great shape recently. And what was our little thing, you know? Well, we were.
00:27:28.707 - 00:27:38.427, Speaker A: It was earlier this summer. We were in Dubai in a car. Yes. Yeah. And I think. I think all I remember is you saying, look, I'm gonna get jacked. Yes, I am.
00:27:38.427 - 00:27:45.607, Speaker A: I am back to jacked. Right. And. But the thing is, I love this. You know, it's like, I think it's going to be great. Like Bezos, you know, great operational mind. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:27:45.607 - 00:28:00.943, Speaker A: You have a great mind for networks like matching with the body. Here's a constraint. Here's a constraint. Here's how it relates, is I, as a founder, you have to put the team first. Right. What happened? Oh, so someone yelling. Okay, I just ignored.
00:28:00.943 - 00:28:21.007, Speaker A: So as a founder, you have to put the team first. And what happens is that basically that means that you lose sleep, you overeat. It's always easy to prioritize the work, the meeting. Exactly. That's right. Because why do they care if you lose 10 minutes, you know, 20 minutes of sleep or whatever? And that adds up and that cumulative. Right.
00:28:21.007 - 00:28:36.173, Speaker A: But what we're doing with every school is we actually use Solana a lot for the proof of workouts. Right. And so you'll have actually a tracker. You can see the GitHub streak and let's see where we are in a year. Amazing. Yeah, yeah, There's a little bit of rhyming here at Mountain Dao. You know, everybody is getting up super early.
00:28:36.173 - 00:29:04.793, Speaker A: Early first chair, you know, hitting the slopes, putting in really hard work. Tully and the engineers that he worked with at Qualcomm used to surf every morning. They did Ironmans. I think this is actually relevant to the cultural kind of contribution that Solana has. Yeah, I think like, basically Zuck, Bezos, several, you know, Brian Johnson and so on. That's an emerging part of tech culture, is self improvement, you know, and we just need to productize that. So take it from something that a tech billionaire can do into something that becomes a product.
00:29:04.793 - 00:29:23.217, Speaker A: Sort of like how. Have you seen. Have you seen Wall street? The movie in Wall Street 2? No, I haven't seen it. There's a sight gag where Michael Douglas comes out of prison and he gets his cell phone back and it's a giant brick. Right. And that's because cell phones in the 80s were for the richest of the rich, and now they're for the poorest of the poor. Right.
00:29:23.217 - 00:29:45.903, Speaker A: And so lots of stuff starts like that as a toy for the rich or whatever. And the reason is because it's an mvp, it barely works and you pay a premium for it and it's. And then you get the scale. And so I think that's going to happen with self improvement. And I think actually the crypto community is. They're selected for actually being into this. You know why? Because crypto is parallel finance.
00:29:45.903 - 00:30:04.327, Speaker A: And it says the existing system exists, but it's fundamentally flawed. We're going to take fundamental assumptions of them and invert it. And so even those surface aspects look the same. Like you still have, you have bar charts on Wall street, you have bar charts in our space, and so on. And you have limit orders. And some of the concepts port other concepts are just fundamentally morally inverted. Like self custody is good.
00:30:04.327 - 00:30:26.385, Speaker A: Well, self custody is impossible at dtcc, right. Or decentralization is good and central. You know, that's impossible in the old system. Right? Inflation is bad and inflation is built into the old system. So we've built a parallel financial system. And the people who are, who are there also have the capital and the moxie to do other things. And that's why other kinds of parallel systems will be built by the people who built the parallel financial system.
00:30:26.385 - 00:30:45.723, Speaker A: We built the parallel financial system, we can build the parallel health system. That's right. Exactly. That's right. And in fact, the parallel financial system is upstream of all of that because. Well, first, you can fund it, all right? And that's important. And second is the legacy system will deplatform and choke point anything that's like too good relative to it.
00:30:45.723 - 00:31:12.389, Speaker A: Right? Like it's just almost like a meta organism. Think about, you know, think about, let's say, Microsoft Windows, right? Anything that was built on Microsoft Windows that was too good, they used the platform against you. That's why you needed your own sovereignty. And in fact, in the 2000s and the early 2010s, DE Platforming had a very different. The conversation around de platforming had a different character to what it does today. It wasn't about political deplatforming, is about economic deplatforming. Right.
00:31:12.389 - 00:31:27.509, Speaker A: For example, God, there's a farmville. Zynga was basically going viral on Facebook and was deplatformed from Facebook. Yeah. Steve Jobs famously said, I would have never let farmville get that big. Yeah, exactly. Which meant he had the control. That's right, that's right.
00:31:27.509 - 00:31:57.219, Speaker A: And essentially, if you are, you know, moderately successful, the platform's happy to have you. If you're getting so big that you're compatible to Scale the platform. The platform has lots of different levers. You know, for example, Twitter, there was a, there's this video app that I forget that was going viral on Twitter. And Twitter just basically cut them out of the feed and they got vine instead and they prioritized vine in the feed. Right. So if you could, you can, you can understand it from an economic standpoint, you understand from a political standpoint.
00:31:57.219 - 00:32:32.051, Speaker A: And those things fuse where often people use the economic justification for what they want to do politically or vice versa. But attacks by platforms are going to become more and more and more important. And that's why crypto becomes more important, because it gives you defense against attacks by platforms. So that's how I see where the world is going. Keep going, you're going. Well, maybe we can switch gears a little bit. I think, you know, one of the use cases that we see exploding on Solana is deepin decentralized physical infrastructure networks like Helium and Hive mappers that have rebuilt 5G wireless networks and mapping networks.
00:32:32.051 - 00:33:26.639, Speaker A: HiveMappers remapped 25% of the world's roads in a year. When I look at what you talk about with the network state, I haven't seen a connection yet between these cloud first, land second movements and then the obvious clear today examples that we have of cloud first first and hardware second. How do those connect? Well, so first is that mapping between cloud and land. You know, the network state is about real estate, okay. Just as much as cryptocurrency is about fiat currency. And what I mean by that is, in theory, cryptocurrency exists completely independent of the fiat world. In practice, the practical details of the crypto fiat exchange, that's 100 billion industry that I was heavily involved in and you know, you're obviously, you know, very aware of and it's going to become a trillion dollar industry.
00:33:26.639 - 00:34:09.105, Speaker A: That bridge is like, it's literally like going over the Atlantic or going over the Pacific. Going up and down into the cloud is something that you will just constantly, constantly do. Going from the land to the cloud and back, it's almost like a transatlantic voyage, right? It's a new new world. And so cryptocurrency was about fiat currency. And when you built that exchange, then you could onboard into the pure crypto world and you can do crypto, crypto trading, you don't have to worry about it, right? And you're in the new world and it's fine. But if you need to go back and forth and lots of people need to onboard before they become full crypto this bridge was important in the same way the network state is about real estate. And so like I've had to deal with more plumbing, electrical work, carpentry, painting, all the physical stuff for building.
00:34:09.105 - 00:34:43.801, Speaker A: I'll put a video out online soon with all the time lapse stuff. It's actually pretty awesome. Network school sign going up. Right? But all the deep end stuff, you know, I need to make a list of all the tools and as they become robust, then we start using them to prove our physical blueprint to the world and then also build everything Iot first. Why is that? Because, you know, Iot a lot of. There's actually this Twitter feed called like Internet of Shit or something like that, which is all about how Iot makes things worse. And like, oh my God, it's a complicated lock and why don't you just unlock it with a key and that's robust and so on so forth.
00:34:43.801 - 00:35:39.245, Speaker A: And I'm sympathetic to that in some ways. But if you have a smart lock that's unlocked by a Solana wallet, well, that means your Solana wallet doesn't just secure your coins, it secures your doors and your cars and your office and your this and your that. Right? And that means your crypto wallet is now up upstream, not just of, let's say, millions of dollars of digital assets, but millions of dollars of physical assets or millions of sol, I should say. Right. Anyway, keep going. Well, so, you know, as you think about building these products and securing the space, can you talk a little bit about how, you know, let's say an island dao or a mountain dao should, you know, go through that work of actually securing land and securing diplomatic recognition? Like, what are the steps? What's their steps? So we're building the playbook now, right? The network school is a tech community that is also meant to boot up other tech communities. Right? So this is, you know, what we're going to do is prototype a lot of this stuff for ourselves.
00:35:39.245 - 00:36:01.603, Speaker A: And so we never. I shouldn't say never. We don't broadcast something unless we know it's working for us at 100 or 1000 or 10,000 person scale. You know, as I'll talk about, the piece of land that we've got can actually scale up to hundreds of thousands of people. Like we can go from right now we're at a Dunbar number stage, like a Stanford dorm room. Then you get to a thousand. It's like the scale of a Stanford undergrad class.
00:36:01.603 - 00:36:26.235, Speaker A: Then you get to 10,000. It's like the scale of Stanford itself, 100,000 is the scale of Stanford and Palo Alto and a million is the scale of San Francisco. As we scale up and we're built to scale, we will put everything we possibly can open source and open state. Did we talk about that? Open state? Yeah, yeah. So like, you know, open source, it was v1 and open state is what blockchains are because you open the back end to, not just the front end. The database is public, not just the code. Right.
00:36:26.235 - 00:36:53.605, Speaker A: So by making everything we can open source and open state, then we publish what we're doing and other communities can learn from that playbook. Right. So to give you some of the things that are working now, for example, one thing that we have and I'll publish on this is what I call the ideology vector. Okay. Do you know like Harry Potter, the Sorting Hat? Harry Potter, yeah, yeah, I know Harry Potter. Okay. So I don't know, I actually, you know, I'm a little bit older than you guys maybe feel.
00:36:53.605 - 00:37:24.431, Speaker A: So Harry Potter came out, it was really popular just after, you know, I was a kid. So there's this concept from it called like the sorting hat, which puts people into different schools or whatever and everybody's got their own, you know, school that's appropriate to them. So one thing we have is something that I call the ideology vector where we actually ask upfront about all these polarizing questions, right? Like example, like what's your position on nuclear power? Or something like that. Right. That's not, you know, for our audience, we're very pro. Other people are con. Right.
00:37:24.431 - 00:37:53.713, Speaker A: So you ask a bunch of questions like that about political figures, about countries, like what's your position on Dubai, what's your position? Or that's another country in cities. What's your position on this Cryptocurrency and that one. And with an RNR community that's very polarizing, right? And you get, let's say, let's say you ask 100 questions and you ask plus 10, minus 10 sentiment. You have a hundred dimensional vector. That vector can now be used to cluster people into communities. And that's actually the new borders, but in digital space. And so that's actually how.
00:37:53.713 - 00:38:22.843, Speaker A: So you're asking for subroutines. There's like 50 subroutines like this that I think of as emerging best practices for startup societies. Another big one, a very important one that we've kind of figured out over the last couple of years now. It's called this sort of proven now at this point is you have to start your startup starts with a Pop up. You can't go like directly to a full built out metropolis or whatever in your head. Like it's hard enough to get a few hundred or a few thousand people. Like this was a logistical effort.
00:38:22.843 - 00:38:32.945, Speaker A: A little bit. Right? Yeah. Great job, team. Yeah, exactly. Right, yeah, great job to the team here for everything they did. Right. This is itself like a mini city in its own right.
00:38:32.945 - 00:38:59.451, Speaker A: Right. And actually the next step is to. It's funny, you know how people make fun of sometimes the crypto community. Oh, crypto is just a bunch of conferences and people go to those conferences and so on. But that's actually one of our hidden strengths. You know why? Because we're used to setting up mini cities around the world like that. We have all these like, fairly technically savvy, hungry, mobile, you know, risk tolerant people who will go around to these things and they think of themselves as part of the Solana community rather than, you know, geo locked.
00:38:59.451 - 00:39:17.443, Speaker A: Right. You're like an unlocked phone. You can operate worldwide. Right. So we can set up the physical infrastructure, we've got the financial infrastructure which is portable across borders, we've got the people who are mobile. We've got all the prerequisites now to just start taking territory and take this from a one day thing into a 365 day thing. Amazing.
00:39:17.443 - 00:40:01.541, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean it reminds me of, of the first break point that we had. It was right after COVID lockdowns, which by the way, your forecast of what was going to happen during COVID lockdowns actually had an impact on us because we launched the network on March 16, 2020. Oh my God, I got to give you huge props. A lot of people had their roadmaps completely derailed in 2020. Every investor was calling, every founder saying, cancer, cancel your launch, do your layoffs, hunker down, it's going to be a slog and focus on survival. And I think your forecast of what was going to happen and the idea that obviously it would be good for crypto, this would be the moment for crypto to actually accelerate, not decelerate.
00:40:01.541 - 00:40:30.675, Speaker A: Otherwise it's not useful. What's it here for? That was a really big moment for us, so thank you for that. Well, the thing about that is just to speak with that for a second, that was an unfortunate event for the whole world. But what it did is it powered up both the state and the network. Like the state got powered up with lockdowns, with tracking of people, with all of these emergency authorities, just 9, 11 to the nth power. You know, in terms of, you know, surveillance, civil liberties and so on. But the network also got powered up.
00:40:30.675 - 00:41:00.677, Speaker A: So Freedom also got powered up. Crypto got powered up, Remote work got powered up. Video conferencing, contracts can get signed online. We flipped in many ways to an Internet first world after 2020. I think future historians will look back on that and realize that was the moment that the Internet became primary and the physical world became secondary. And for example, like, you write a document first and only if it's really important, you print it out. You go through a shopping cart first online, and only if it's really important, you hit a button, you print it out to your door, you look online for an Uber, you know, or a grab.
00:41:00.677 - 00:41:41.115, Speaker A: And if it's, if it's time, then you hit a button and it comes to your door, right? And you have your cryptocurrency. And you know, that's where much. You know, if you have 1% of your net worth in cryptocurrency today, you'll have 100% of your net worth of cryptocurrency by 2040 or thereabouts. Like, that's, that's what crypto, that's what currency becomes, right? Yeah. So anyway, that flip to the Internet first world, you guys were extremely well positioned for that and you did extremely well. So very good job on that. So as you've been building out the network state infrastructure, you've been using things like TIP Link, you've used Super Team, you've used all kinds of phantom, all of these primitives, have you? And then you've been doing the work of establishing the network school and working with plumbers and contractors and all these things.
00:41:41.115 - 00:42:14.921, Speaker A: Have any product ideas started to emerge from you? So many. So actually I'm going to be putting up some bounties on these. Basically, the quote Idea Guy is not worth that much, but the Idea plus Capital Guy is now worth something. Right? So the Idea plus Capital Guy is a person who is time limited, but not capital limited. I just don't have time to build all the stuff that I'd love to see built. Right. So now that, so, you know, you mentioned some of these products like Phantom Wallet.
00:42:14.921 - 00:43:01.861, Speaker A: The wallet just works and you can just like go like this boom and USD back and forth. And you know, by the way, you know, you know that I launched usdc, right? Do you know that? Yeah, I do know that. You've launched so many things USDC at Coinbase. If you go back and look, September 2018, there's a story of that for a second because Now I use USCC every day, but basically in September 2018 circles, you know, they had a smart contract for, just to digress on this for a second, because an important part of the Solana ecosystem system, they had a smart contract that was audited and it worked, but they didn't have any distribution and so on. And if you go back and look before the coinbase USDC launch, USDC's market cap was like 10 million or $0, like as of like September 1, 2018. Right. And you can go and look at the YouTube video.
00:43:01.861 - 00:43:25.855, Speaker A: I'll post that after this if you want. Where we launched usdc, we launched on Coinbase and we set up because, you know, the only way it would work is if you had multiple exceptions exchanges adopting it. And we had to figure out all the decentralization stuff and the redemption stuff. So that turned it from a audited smart contract into what, you know, the V1 of USDC. And we put Coinbase's exchange behind it. And we did all that stuff. We did that with, you know what I did on that? We just took two engineers.
00:43:25.855 - 00:43:45.481, Speaker A: And the hardest part was me just clearing away every single meeting. And when people wanted to try to get a meeting with them, I would stand outside the room and HR was not allowed. Nobody could bug them for any signatures or anything. I really didn't care. The government could throw us in jail. Like there would be no signatures. Nobody would bother by engineers, right? Giving them that 30 days of just total protected time.
00:43:45.481 - 00:44:13.011, Speaker A: We shipped the whole thing in like basically a month. And now it's at like $35 billion from you know, 10 million. And USDC on Sol with Phantom Wallet, it just works tip link, you can send. It's like Mailchimp for NFTs. And remind me, where do I get a phone? Product ideas. Okay, right. So what are product ideas? So one thing I'd like to have is the like a NFT check in.
00:44:13.011 - 00:44:46.865, Speaker A: Okay. So for example, at the front desk over here you have like a pretty cool check in thing where you show your barcode and you're in, right? So connecting NFT check in to an NFT gated door lock would be I think, a pretty important thing. And the thing is you have to figure out the right application for it. Airbnb hosts are good because they are tech savvy and they have an incentive to let lots of people in and out over the Internet so they don't have to be there physically to let them in the door. Right. So I think we're now at the point that NFT door locks and NFT check in is one thing. So that's number one.
00:44:46.865 - 00:45:26.265, Speaker A: Number two is we're going to talk about this in Network City conference in a few days. But there's this, there's this great image of unbundling of banks where they take a screenshot of a bank homepage and they highlight loans and like wire transfers and this, that and the other. And now today you can take every single part of that and you can circle it and you can show the Solana product that basically is like, okay, here's how we unbundle the bank and here's how we unbundled the derivative and here's how we unbundled the savings account and interest and weird, because you were just asking me backstage to send you my slides for the network state and those are two slides in the deck. Yes, that's right, because I did. Well, we talked. Okay, we didn't talk about that. That's right.
00:45:26.265 - 00:46:27.877, Speaker A: So that is the roadmap for literally unbundling the entire banking system and putting it on chain. Because USDC sol means that anybody gets essentially root access to the banking system, right? You can send and receive arbitrary quantities of money even if in USD, even if you're in Brazil and India and Hungary or whatever, Japan. Right. And the thing about that, by the way, is most people don't realize how big a deal that is because the one way of putting it, for example, is multinational corporations did not don't really exist until the blockchain. You know why? Why? Because if, let's say you're in Brazil and you want to acquire a company in Bangladesh, how many people have done like a Portuguese Urdu contract? Who knows the tax obligations for that? Between those two things, what happens instead is you set up like a US adapter because the US did enough business with Brazil, enough business with Bangladesh. Or you might set up a China adapter because they also do business with the whole world. China, that's their own ecosystem.
00:46:27.877 - 00:46:50.955, Speaker A: The Chinese can do that. Nobody else can really. But those are the two like hub nodes of the whole world in terms of legal and financial infrastructure. Like Miami, for example, is used as the hub for Latin America because if you're Mexican and Argentinian, you do a deal in Miami and that would be where the banking and contracts are signed. A neutral jurisdiction entrepreneur. Singapore is that role for Southeast Asia to some extent. Right.
00:46:50.955 - 00:47:12.873, Speaker A: But now you have the blockchain for contract enforcement. And over time we go from having transactions on chain to accounting on chain. Right. For small companies and startups, that's already happening. Right. To once you have accounting, you can have an on chain SEC because you're approvable, cryptographically verifiable accounting. And you can have an sec.
00:47:12.873 - 00:47:28.401, Speaker A: When you have an sec, you can have on chain investment and, you know, and so on and so forth and capital formation. I mean, we have lots of pieces of this. Right. We've seen like the Marshall Islands too, where they're starting to replace actual paper contracts with smart contracts. Yes. It might take 20 years, but they'll eventually swap them out. That's right.
00:47:28.401 - 00:47:49.457, Speaker A: So all you need, I mean, for example, you know, as you mentioned, the Marshall Islands, the Cayman Islands, which is, you know, not the Marsh Islands, but the Cayman Islands only has a population of 70,000 people. It's like a small town, basically. Right. But what they do have is they have a flag, they have sovereignty, and they're a UN member. And that sovereignty is worth billions, hundreds of billions of dollars to them, literally. Billion dollar funds are headquartered in Cayman. Right.
00:47:49.457 - 00:48:02.299, Speaker A: So all of these small countries, their biggest asset is their sovereignty. What do they lack, though? They lack population, they lack income. That's what we have. So there's a market. This is like 10% of the Caymans right here. Yeah, probably. That's right.
00:48:02.299 - 00:48:25.981, Speaker A: Exactly. That's right. So there's a. Absolutely a market to be made between small countries and large clouds. Right. Like big chains and small countries can do amazing deals together where you guys, we give them, the followers, the online strength, the capital that they just don't have. And they have, crucially, the international recognition, sovereignty.
00:48:25.981 - 00:48:35.061, Speaker A: It's like a banking license, but it's, you know, it's a. It's a. It's a. It's a sovereignty license. Right. Well, we have one minute left. Two questions.
00:48:35.061 - 00:48:55.735, Speaker A: One, will you be here at the conference for the next few days? Will you be around to speak with folks? I will. So this is like the business busiest week of my life. Maybe one of the top few. Right. Because I'm launching the Network School. But I will be, you know, I will be at the Network State Conference, 22nd. And that's going to be here at this venue at the end of the venue.
00:48:55.735 - 00:49:07.785, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Everybody should go, if you like this. Actually, we're doing a home at Home. Raj is going to be speaking there. So go to thenetworkstate.comconference or ns.comconference. oh, I love that URL much.
00:49:07.785 - 00:49:13.673, Speaker A: Right. This is great. It's like affiliate market. It's like webrings in the early. Yeah. And put in Code Breakpoint. You'll get a little bit off.
00:49:13.673 - 00:49:28.169, Speaker A: Okay, so I'd love to see all you guys there. So. And we're going to do a long Q and A at the end. So you have questions for me, come to the network state conference, and I'm happy to see you there. Okay. I want to two more things. One is on a lighter note, I love bets.
00:49:28.169 - 00:49:44.071, Speaker A: I think anybody who's my friend knows that I like making bets. Can we make a bet about getting actually jacked? Okay, so I'm coming. Let's say my next breakpoint. Next year. Next year, break point, I'm going to post the Rocky style progress video, rain or shine. Okay. Okay.
00:49:44.071 - 00:50:04.245, Speaker A: And we're going to put it on screen and the audience can say if it worked or not. Okay, great. We'll work out the rest of the terms on Twitter. But that next break point, Balaji is going to be super jacked. All right, let's see. Amazing. And then last thing is, you have this great photo at the last network conference of you in a selfie with, you know, the beginnings of the whole community.
00:50:04.245 - 00:50:15.725, Speaker A: Do you want to do a selfie with the Solana Network State? Great. All right. Awesome. Let's do it. If you have any signs, hold them up. Nice. Excellent.
00:50:15.725 - 00:50:25.133, Speaker A: Oh, wow. You got that? That is logistical preparation. Oh, my God. Wonderful. What a crowd. All right, let's do it. All right.
00:50:25.133 - 00:50:33.229, Speaker A: Let's get close together. Okay. Oh, man. It's a mascot. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay.
00:50:33.229 - 00:50:42.357, Speaker A: Oh, my God. That is prepared. I can't see the mascot. I can't see the mascot. He's good. It's fine. Okay.
00:50:42.357 - 00:50:53.863, Speaker A: Mascot should go on to the side or something like that so we can see him. Okay. All right. One, two, three, cheese. Yeah, we should do a video. Solana, right? Okay. Yeah.
00:50:53.863 - 00:51:09.991, Speaker A: Break. Do we have video? Let's do it. We can do 1, 2, 3, Solana. Everybody says that. Okay. 1, 2, 3, SolANA. Okay.
00:51:09.991 - 00:52:56.497, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Sa. What is going on here? Do you guys know? Okay, I'll tell you, you may or may not have heard. We're doing programming a little bit differently this year at Breakpoint.
00:52:56.497 - 00:53:54.151, Speaker A: And right now we're about to introduce the first ever debate that will happen live at Breakpoint on Breakpoint Stage. Are you guys excited about it? Yeah. So this first topic is going to be Crypto's only use case is speculation or is it? Okay, so allow me to introduce the speakers. Tarun from Robot Ventures and Gauntlet, my friend Vibhu from Europe and this debate will be moderated by Tristan from Backpack. Let's give him a warm applause. Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for being here.
00:53:54.151 - 00:54:22.631, Speaker A: Lovely to see so many familiar faces here early in the morning. Today's first debate is crypto's only use case is Speculation four. We have Tarun, founder of Gauntlet, against we have Viboo, founder of Drip. My role, my role in this will mostly just be controlling time between the two. And for the manlets, we have a little gauntlet as well. So we might kind of ring that. All right, why don't we start with the foresight or.
00:54:22.631 - 00:54:59.953, Speaker A: Yeah, great. Hey, everyone. So first off, I think I want to say that for this debate, I'm going to really only be talking about on chain usage. I think generally off chain usage or RWAs are kind of distinct from the notion of speculation within crypto. It's. And if we think about crypto itself, it's really best when it can be used as censorship resistant programmable money. And given that context, the argument for why speculation will be the dominant application is the following.
00:54:59.953 - 00:55:39.905, Speaker A: And we'll kind of go through the points and then why each point holds. So the first property is that money has a lot of properties that are synergistic with speculation. No shit, Sherlock. Right? Like everyone kind of would agree with that. But the second thing that's important is censorship resistant money has weaker liquidity and asset concentration effects than censorable money. So I can always kind of replicate an asset, make a new asset, find liquidity for it. Liquidity isn't locked to, to particular assets in a way that's very different than censorable money like fiat.
00:55:39.905 - 00:56:44.215, Speaker A: This inherent liquidity and asset fragmentation creates a natural reason to have speculative and arbitrage value, which means that because there's many pools that are fragmented, there's a lot more reason to actually be trading all the time. And this naturally means that the most profitable activity on chain will be speculation and trading. And there's a feedback loop, loop there. And a very key point to this is that censorship resistant money cannot really bound what percentage of the economy is used for speculation versus the real economy that does do that. Okay, so the first step in this argument that I said was money has a bunch of properties that make it good for speculation. Everyone is here in this room, so if you didn't know that, I would be dumbfounded. But there's sort of four properties of money that really are really useful for speculation.
00:56:44.215 - 00:57:31.317, Speaker A: First, naturally, it's a store of value. Second, it can act as a numerator so you can measure relative value. Third is scarcity, so you know you understand that you're not being inflated away. And fourth, stability. These four properties naturally are competing with one another to ensure that there's a lot of trading volume. Anytime a new asset is created, some of the liquidity that is in other assets have to migrate, which inevitably threatens the stability of the asset. Digital commodities tokens, meme coins, nft is anything that anyone in this room is embarrassed to admit to their grandmother that they bought have negligible creation costs.
00:57:31.317 - 00:58:23.915, Speaker A: There's no real legal, human or physical costs. And as we are using Solana, I don't think the gas cost is much of an issue either. Second, censorship resistance breeds liquidity fragmentation. This is sort of, kind of obvious, probably more if you look at roll ups where every time you go on a new roll up you see 500 versions of USDC and you're not sure which one you're supposed to use. But in general there's always no incentive to stick to existing assets. There's oftentimes a lot of incentive to create a new asset to attract liquidity to new asset and fragment existing liquidity. This naturally creates a speculative feedback loop between new asset creation drying out liquidity from existing assets and arbitraging the difference between the two.
00:58:23.915 - 00:59:10.155, Speaker A: Naturally, this becomes a very profitable activity. There will always exist some subset of the populace that has positive expectations returns from this. And because of censorship resistance, you can't really restrict how much speculation there is. I can't do something like a government would do, such as forced reserve requirements or not allow you to trade a title. 30 more seconds on opening remarks. Cool. Naturally, this concentration effect of having a strictly positive profitable activity in a feedback loop with new asset creation is inevitably too hard to stop.
00:59:10.155 - 00:59:33.925, Speaker A: And any other application would need to create more excess value to the entire network than this trading activity, which seems extremely unlikely. I rest. Thank you. And against Viboo. Okay, thank you for that PhD thesis. Someone had to do it. All right, I'm going to start out by asking you a question.
00:59:33.925 - 01:00:16.183, Speaker A: So I brought this bag up on stage and I'm curious, like if anyone wants to call out, what do you think is in this bag? Art money. Art money. Okay, so in fact it's. It is a version of Tarun's old hair. I don't know if you've seen it, but I bring this to make the point that in fact this is just the bag. It has the utility of carrying something for me, and yet it's relatively easy to get people to speculate upon something that isn't actually very speculative. And humans, I mean, we speculate on everything.
01:00:16.183 - 01:00:54.655, Speaker A: I could also ask what are the chances you think I'm going to put this on for the photo op? Probably pretty high at some point. Why not? But it doesn't change the nature of what the technology does. And you can think about a bag as a piece of technology in this example. My belief actually, and this is a radical thing to say, is that crypto is actually anti speculative technology. It's actually the most anti speculative economic device that we've ever created. And I would ask you to consider that. How do people speculate, right? They speculate when they don't know something.
01:00:54.655 - 01:02:23.475, Speaker A: If I had simply come up on stage and I just put this here and I'd said, what am I holding? There's no, there's nothing you can speculate on, right? It's quite transparent that I'm holding a purple wig. And that's what a blockchain is, right? A blockchain is a system where everybody knows all of the information at all times. And now to some of his points about store of value, I think you said scarcity, stability, measure, relative value. In my opinion, it's very hard to argue that the only, very hard to argue that there isn't speculation happening because again, anyone can speculate on anything any time, that's just a human property. But what I can say is that I think that the faster that information travels between people, the faster that everyone knows the same things at the same time, the less, the less speculation there is. I'll give you an example of how on chain products are actually much less speculative than their real world counterparts. There was this famous, there was this tweet the other day that kind of went viral from Vitalik and he was talking about on chain lending versus real world lending and there's a huge difference, right? Because in the real world lending you have credits, you're taking out a loan against assets that the lender doesn't necessarily completely understand.
01:02:23.475 - 01:02:57.525, Speaker A: And this practice is just kind of how it works. And there's layers and layers and layers upon layers of speculation in the, in the lending space. In the real world, on chain lending is actually like super unspeculative, right? Every, if you want to take out a loan against an nft, you have to like you can only lend against the NFT's value itself. That's on chain. If you're taking out a loan against any assets, usually it's fully collateralized or over collateralized. So there's actually, there's actually nothing. There's no speculation involved in that piece at all.
01:02:57.525 - 01:03:32.343, Speaker A: Now I think you could say, well Vibhu, there's look at what's happening with the tokens. They're going up and down all the time. There's so much speculation happening. Oh my gosh. But if you observe, in my opinion what's happening on crypto is speculations happening in a very compressed amount of time. And price discovery, especially on salon and fast chains, you have like almost instantaneous price discovery. Why does every token go to zero very quickly? Because there's actually very little underlying value to many of them and the market finds that out almost as quickly as could be in the real world.
01:03:32.343 - 01:04:12.227, Speaker A: Tons of. I mean one of Totally's ideas about Solana is that one of the reasons that Solana exists is to remove the impact of somebody knowing something that you don't know and being able to manipulate a market or to kind of like cut in front of you in line in a trade. 30 seconds left on opening remarks. Take profits. And so I think to me what's the faster blockchains gets, the less speculation we're going to see and you can never eliminate it completely. That's a really, again really can't argue that. But I think Solana relative to all other chains is really the anti speculation machine in some ways.
01:04:12.227 - 01:04:51.745, Speaker A: So that's, that's my argument. Thank you. Viboo Tarun. Two minutes on feelings replies to what Viboo has shared here as his view against crypto as a speculative asset. Yeah, I think there's certainly some non speculative activity that exists in blockchains right there. There is digital property. The digital property rights are inevitably encumbered in a way that might not allow them to trade as freely as you might expect with the example of lending versus in the real world where you can lend against things you don't fully understand versus on chain where you really need transparency in oracle pricing and liquidity.
01:04:51.745 - 01:06:09.423, Speaker A: However, I think there are a few points there that I would say I strongly disagree with. The first point is the idea that a faster chain will have less speculation to quote Totally. I think the goal of Solana is to bring the NASDAQ on chain, to bring one of the places that is the home of the greatest speculative market in the world on chain to be able to support that in a way that's decentralized. And I think in general that goal of being able to be faster and having higher price discovery means that there's less risk that you take in speculating on these assets than you would in prior markets or on other chains. And so I think there's a natural actual reason for the increased usage of technology within crypto to improve ux, to improve speed, and to improve distribution of actually making speculation much more high throughput. And I think that is sort of one of the things that seems to actually be more true and resounding over time. On the other hand, I think you also brought up items that maybe people don't care about transferring, say the bag that you have, or a representation of a memory of the past.
01:06:09.423 - 01:06:48.419, Speaker A: I certainly agree, but even amongst commerce platforms that exist within Web two, there's inherently secretly speculation. That speculation is not transparent to the end user. The end user actually is the product of that speculation. That speculation is people bidding in ad auctions, that speculation is people buying influencer time. All of those things themselves have a speculatory aspect. Okay, we're going to go over to Vibu as a reply for two minutes and a few seconds. Yeah, I mean, I also find myself agreeing with what you're saying, but again, we cannot argue whether speculation happens.
01:06:48.419 - 01:07:33.079, Speaker A: I think we can really argue, is crypto more speculative or less speculative than what came before it in terms of economic systems? So in the commerce example that you just mentioned, great example, because I think you can think of, you know, what are the things like all economic activities on some kind of spectrum between maybe commerce and investment. And there's lots of things like if you buy a bag from a, like an Hermes bag, okay, expensive bag, it's part commerce, it's part investment. Right. There's lots of things that kind of are somewhere in there. But in, in the case of crypto payments, there's actually almost zero speculation happening at all because of the properties of crypto. Right. It's when I put the money into the account, you can see it at the same time that I can see it.
01:07:33.079 - 01:07:56.081, Speaker A: And there's nothing really to. There's nothing to imagine there. Right. And in fact, the word speculation is a very interesting word because it's been changed and used in many different ways over time. It is about imagining. It's actually about imagination, about imagining a future that you can see, maybe somebody else cannot. And crypto, again, it's just completely wiping that away.
01:07:56.081 - 01:08:48.197, Speaker A: And always very present. It's always about, what can I see? Everyone can see it, and what can we do with it. You mentioned property rights, another good example, because I think you would agree that when something moves very slowly, like when an asset cannot be sold very easily, it does allow for less price discovery and therefore less speculation. You also, I think you said that there's less risk in speculating on chain, but that's kind of an interesting thing to argue because I think those two things are really the same, right. In some ways, like. And so if you can argue that there's less risk in speculating on chain, then you're also arguing that crypto is much less speculative. Thank you, Viva.
01:08:48.197 - 01:09:49.692, Speaker A: We're going to go back to Tarun for 90 seconds and some extra time there on your closing remarks before we ring the gauntlet. Great. Yeah. So I think the main thing I want to kind of emphasize for you is crypto's story has been a story about creating a new type of commodity, a new type of money, and a new type of notion of verifiable provenance for assets that are purely digital in that world. The idea of speculating on these assets, the idea of creating new assets is just as easy as creating a new social network as creating a new social network account or liking a post. This is something that, you know, if you went back 100 years and went to, you know, the SEC and you told them, people will not be making assets by buying orange groves and trying to give you the. The dividends from that, but people are actually just going to be making jokes and meme coins and making those assets and trading them.
01:09:49.692 - 01:10:27.835, Speaker A: The idea that this is even possible is amazing to someone a hundred years ago. And it's inevitable that the person who you would tell would ask, how can I buy these assets? How can I bet on these assets? And in this vein, crypto is naturally a place for speculation. The speculatory aspects, because of sense, because of the censorship, resistance, properties, because of the fact that there's constantly new assets, effectively ensures that the highest profitable activity will be speculation in its various shapes and forms. Thank you. Closing statements. Vivu. Before we switch.
01:10:27.835 - 01:11:03.085, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think that, yeah, unfortunately, I don't. I don't disagree with how you have phrased this argument, but to say that speculation is going to be the most profitable thing is absolutely crazy. Like, and one of the things you mentioned was that that's Tolle's goal has been the NASDAQ on chain. I think people misunderstand. NASDAQ is not an incredible business. In fact, the things that are represented in the exchange are, like, collectively, like, significantly bigger than the total amount of kind of revenues that something like that might produce.
01:11:03.085 - 01:11:54.053, Speaker A: But I do think that the reason that feels that way today is because the only thing that we have working today in crypto is exchanges at a high level, but that really is changing. There's so many interesting things that I'm sure you would agree are being built on, on all chains, especially on Solana, on the consumer side, including Drip and other things like that that are, in my opinion, and I think if this industry is to survive, are going to be much, much bigger than the things that are happening on chain today. So, yeah. Yeah, that's kind of what I have to say. Okay, thank you, gentlemen. Now you will have an opportunity to take the other side for a minute each, because I know this is a complex topic, and as the first debate, we have to do this the honors. Okay, you can start this time.
01:11:54.053 - 01:12:17.825, Speaker A: Vivu. Okay. So, yeah, we were asked to have to argue both sides for a little bit. So when I was researching this topic, I kind of flipped views a little bit. So originally my emotional reaction was, no, of course it can't just be speculation. There's so many things about speculation. Then I did a lot of research and I felt, in fact, everything is kind of speculative.
01:12:17.825 - 01:13:05.899, Speaker A: And so it's really, really tough, like I said, to argue that crypto doesn't have a lot of speculative elements. But I would say that we wouldn't be here without speculation because. And to the point of, like, information traveling faster, creating less and less speculation over time, that kind of worked the opposite way in the favor of crypto because, like, bitcoin, in fairness, is like, is quite slow. Ethereum, much faster now than it was, but was a little bit faster. And you can see in like, each successive generation of blockchains, a lot more speculation, a lot more volatility in the early days and kind of, I think, starting to, you know, find a resting place. Thank you. Speculation brings a lot of capital, and that's really important for building things.
01:13:05.899 - 01:13:52.311, Speaker A: So. Yeah, yeah. So my argument against crypto being strictly about speculation, if we look at the history of cryptocurrency, it has been enabled by a constant stream of technological advances in cryptography. So public key systems, zero knowledge proofs, trusted enclaves, decentralized systems in the sense of new protocols that could have more larger and larger validator sets and new hardware. And each time there was a new update in technology to cryptocurrency systems. Either existing chains took advantage of that and upstream those features, or a new chain came and built ecosystem around those new features. There was excess value created in each of those examples.
01:13:52.311 - 01:14:44.095, Speaker A: So Solana being a great example, where by taking advantage of a lot of hardware updates and different architectural decisions, you're able to get faster performance. There is clearly a value difference between that and a thing where the existing speculation does not grow with the technology. Cool. Thank you so much to both of the debaters. Thank you to the audience. Have a good rest of your day. Thank you all the debaters for a amazing first debate live at Breakpoint.
01:14:44.095 - 01:16:31.933, Speaker A: Stick around. Next we have four back to back keynotes and the first one is cast. Hi everyone, my name is Raghulan Pathi, I'm the co founder of cast. Previously before starting Cast I set up the Circle business in Asia best known for USDC and I'm very passionate about ST. The reason is that for about 150 countries in the world today, banking is basically not working anymore. But stablecoins are a real alternative which is real, which people can use. But the actual usability of stablecoins the experience today is not great because you've got to go to an exchange or a wallet.
01:16:31.933 - 01:18:05.095, Speaker A: So we thought what about if you could build the world's future bank on chain because you have all the components such as like a checking account, a savings account with yield bank stable coins and a card. And what if we could deliver that to the world? And we believe Solana is one of the only ecosystems on which you could build this fast, cheap and built on Solana. The CAST magic is really that we spend an incredible amount of time on our experience so you can sign up in KYC in three minutes and it supports people from nearly any country in the world and we're continuously expanding that and so we're trying to strip away the complex user experience that you see in most of crypto and really make it very, very simple so you can go and sign up today on Cast Off Finance. Now we have also launched Solana Validator which is with our partner Kiln which most people would know and you can go and look for the CAST validator today and stake on there. It's a 0% commission, 100% MEV kickback and it's about a 7.6 APY. Now the the main reason we're launching this will be apparent in just a few seconds because you might be wondering what's a future bank that people are trying to build on chain got to do with a Solana validator.
01:18:05.095 - 01:18:53.899, Speaker A: And for that we introduce PayFi. We're going to allow you to hold up to spend up to 60% of your soul that you hold with us interest free forever. And this is the first time that it's actually going to happen. And so this means that on Certain plans, we'll obviously hold it in our validator and use that to subsidize your spending. But it'll be a very, very seamless experience that you'll be able to tap and pay anywhere. Now, if you think that was good, we're releasing the first ever Solana card. This is going to be available in pre order.
01:18:53.899 - 01:19:38.895, Speaker A: Now you can get your free virtual card very soon and you can use the app today to get it. But I know you're coming here to just not see ordinary things. You want to see something a little bit crazy. So we also have a black metal card which we've designed which illuminates on tap pay. This goes for a 10 SOL but includes a whole bunch of other benefits. And so this is a bit of a show off factor that you can take take around and you can tap and pay with your cool Solana card. But that's not the real show.
01:19:38.895 - 01:20:30.245, Speaker A: The real show is what I'm about to show you. The real show is the Solana Solid Gold card. This is for those who really feel that way that they really want to go and show off the heaviest solid Gold card ever made in the world. We actually have a normal gold card as well in between which I didn't have time to put into the presentation which you can get but with the solid Gold card and it cost us more than $10,000 to make one of these, you actually get three of the supplementary normal gold cards as well. And you can hold 60% interest free on your card and you can spend against your soul and you also get the highest points forever. Now we only have 100 of these for sale. It's really if you really are crazy and that's the way that you want to go.
01:20:30.245 - 01:21:00.719, Speaker A: But it's available for pre order now. But in either case, if you want to be part of the Solana ecosystem, we'll be releasing the virtual card for free. And so just to show you, I do actually have a version of the Solid Gold card right here that you can actually see. And we're super excited to partner with Solana and introduce this to the ecosystem. Thank you. Go to CAS Finance Solana to find out more. Thank you so much.
01:21:00.719 - 01:21:43.073, Speaker A: Ragulan from Cast. We have three more keynotes coming up for you. Next up we have product the first, the number one game on Salana that you didn't know existed from Ian, founder of Photo Finish. Let's give her him a warm welcome. Good morning. So yeah, welcome everyone. I am here to talk about my company.
01:21:43.073 - 01:22:34.915, Speaker A: We jumped ahead. I Am the founder of Third Time Entertainment. You may know me previously as the creative director of the Madden Football franchise and here, really excited to share with you something we've been passionately building for nearly nine years in the making. This is a bold vision we always had to create a horse racing game that was more of an open ecosystem where real money was on the line, where skill based gameplay was at the core. And we chose to bring this game to Solana for its speed, its security and really the vibrant community that Solana brings. So I'm proud to say we really have built something remarkable at this point. Photo Finish Live is really blazing new trails to showcase what's possible from a game in Web3.
01:22:34.915 - 01:23:31.905, Speaker A: Since launching in April of 2023, Photo Finish has seen seen steady growth, really on the back of best in class engagement, retention and spend. The core web3 integration of this game has seen over 7 million USDC paid back to the track owners, the players that are staking our crown token every minute of every day. Players are racing, they are breeding, they are fully immersed in this virtual horse racing world that we've created. And yeah, breeding's a little weird, but they do it. We have been setting ourselves up for mainstream appeal this whole time. The millions of sports fans and horse racing fans, as well as the betting community worldwide. And we are now the only official gaming partner of the biggest name in the sport, the Kentucky Derby.
01:23:31.905 - 01:24:19.285, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, that's all right. But as we have strived to scale up and reach new heights to this game, we continue to face significant challenges. The easiest data point for everyone, I think, to look at, is that many investors really no longer take this space seriously. There are much fewer left that even believe in the power of gaming in Web3. And we've seen a nearly 90% drawdown in funding of Web3 game development projects since 2022. So why is this? I think my first question would be, well, where are all the damn games? 5 billion VC dollars got plowed into web3 gaming projects in 2021 and 2022.
01:24:19.285 - 01:24:53.383, Speaker A: Where did the money go? And so we can point the finger at grifters or we can point the finger at, you know, VCs picking the wrong project. I don't really know. We can kind of realize the past has passed and it is time to alter that trajectory. This is the situation we're in now, though. Traditional game developers really dismiss this whole space that we're in. I hope everyone realizes that it's cluttered. They think it's all scams, they think it's all over promises or under delivers and VC and investors continue to possibly prioritize short term gains.
01:24:53.383 - 01:25:36.805, Speaker A: You see these early token launches really focusing on hype rather than sustainability, which is a struggle. But we are here to lead by example to create these games that onboard not just gamers but professional game developers to really attract more professional teams to this space. And so that's why I am thrilled to announce as of right now, hopefully this clicks. Photo Finish is now the very first real money horse racing game approved by Apple in the world. Thank you. And the exciting news. We're also a launch day partner with a seeker.
01:25:36.805 - 01:26:06.905, Speaker A: Also another round. There you go. Please clap. So at the same time we're still working on a live streaming app. So our goal is really to exit the bubble of crypto, right? It's getting from thousands of users to millions and this is getting us into the mainstream as well as some new partners. So I'm not announcing these today, but the journey is never ending. We continue to work on these landmark partnerships across the betting and racing industries across the entire globe.
01:26:06.905 - 01:26:39.215, Speaker A: These aren't just milestones for us. We really hope that they are calls to action for the entire Web3 gaming industry. We're currently raising our own venture round, but at the same time I'm more than happy to help any team that needs to raise or I'm also happy to help any VCs that need an extra pair of eyes. If you're looking at projects, we can all raise the bar together. I think building for mainstream audiences on every device. Let's please just build more games, build more apps. Collectively I know we can do this.
01:26:39.215 - 01:27:17.033, Speaker A: So to sum up, I of course would be thrilled if you all want to join Photo Finish, you want to start breeding yourself, feel free. But if you want to check out Gamer Village today, we have a really special event today and tomorrow. Swing by, get your very own NFT and we're putting on a special race tomorrow on the main stage. So all of these big name personalities within Solana are going to be racing on the main stage tomorrow. If you pick the winner, we even have some free bottles of champagne possibly that might be given away. Going to be a great event. So thank you so much.
01:27:17.033 - 01:27:49.739, Speaker A: I'll see you all in Gamer Village. Thank you so much. Ian from Photo Finish. Next up we have Ka, the co founder of Bird Eye. Wow, this is exciting. Thank you very much for coming here. My name is Ka.
01:27:49.739 - 01:28:16.532, Speaker A: I'm the co founder at Bird Eye and very excited to be here with you guys. To give you guys Some updates about what we have been working on and as well as what is the. What is lying in the road ahead. So breakfast is very special events in the year. Right. Because it's like a checkpoint to looking back and looking forward. And firstly at Bird Eye, I want to show you guys some numbers about how we have been doing in 2024.
01:28:16.532 - 01:28:59.093, Speaker A: So the first one, the first number is in 2024 we served 24 million retail users. So that means there was 24 million people actually visited our website to check in for different information, token price and checking for some wallet information. So that's exciting. The second one is that we have been building over 30 features, data and trading features for our retail users. That including all the token information on the wallet information swapping, some rewards for you guys. Yeah. And that one is being increased a lot in the rest of the year and also next year as well.
01:28:59.093 - 01:29:41.113, Speaker A: And the last one is we have 44 million API requests to our servers every day. And that means every second like this, there are like over 500 people actually assessing requests to our servers to getting the information to go to your wallets exchange and many others applications that you guys use every day. So that's exciting. This is whether or not this is. Are we proud of this? Yes. But is it good enough? No. So what do we think is that Currently Birdeye is the most comprehensive tool for on chain traders and also for the Birdeye data services.
01:29:41.113 - 01:30:13.545, Speaker A: We are currently the most reliable and most popular trading data provider for crypto projects. Yes. But everything is just getting started. So today we are very excited to introduce three major upgrades for us. So we are introducing a totally new interface that's a lot faster. We're introducing features that allow you to personalize your bodai experience. And of course a totally new mobile app as well.
01:30:13.545 - 01:30:51.955, Speaker A: Right, I'll go through that one. So firstly, we redesigned, completely redesigned bodai and the new versions with the new technology, new servers, new infrastructure designed, it's going to be like 2.3 times faster than what you are using right now. So that means you can get the information a lot faster, a lot more real time and you can make a better decision on chain. Okay. And this one can be shipped in mid October. So about three weeks from now you're going to receive the information update and when you go to Birdeye you're going to see the new version.
01:30:51.955 - 01:31:33.267, Speaker A: Okay. And the second one we are introducing Bird Eye Panel. So Bird Eye Panel is where you can actually using our data, but then customize the user interface. You can drag and Drop. You can monitor what you care about because we have been working to build all the tools based on what we know. But I think that Solana community is very talented and you guys want to cook your own monitor dashboard. So we build Bird Eye panel so you can actually build your own dashboard and then you can publish and also introduce it to your users, to your friends, to the people, to your community.
01:31:33.267 - 01:31:59.505, Speaker A: So this is something very, very important. And of course finally. Oh sorry, but this one gonna ship also in mid October as well. So three weeks from now and finally we have the mobile app. So mobile app is already in the final stage of reviewing. You're going to have the data on the go with instant notifications. So that means you will not miss any signals.
01:31:59.505 - 01:32:32.555, Speaker A: If you remember, we also have something called Bodeye alerts. So it's like you can do a lot of technical analysis and when all the condition being met, you can actually send the notification to your email currently. But with Bodeye mobile app you can actually send it directly to your phone. So that will reduce a lot of waiting time and you can major trade like buy or sell it on time. All right. And this one is actually being released very soon. This one even shipped in early October, so about two weeks from now.
01:32:32.555 - 01:33:02.125, Speaker A: All right, so those are our updates today. We have only five minutes, so I cannot tell you more. We are working on a lot of other things but that one going to be for the next update. So The Booty version 2 which is a new interface that's a lot faster. Booty panel features that allow you to personalize your Bird Eye experience and the totally newly designed mobile app. Thank you very much and all the future updates until next time. Bye bye.
01:33:02.125 - 01:34:03.065, Speaker A: Thank you so much. K Teaching us more about Bird Eye, one of the most beloved products in the DeFi ecosystem, now made even more user friendly and accessible. So the next project and keynote needs no introduction and we're going to pan to video to hype this up. Juke, juke, juke juke juke juke juke for some juke that's exchanging soup that's the way that we move yeah Pac, we got active recruiting. Yeah. That's the whole moment we packed yeah. Bags feeling fat I be mad if I lose it I won't never let them take this.
01:34:03.065 - 01:34:12.275, Speaker A: You got. Yeah. I see straight. Yeah. Hop on spaces we get crazy yeah. Screen J for J Straight from the town hall to the stages. Yeah.
01:34:12.275 - 01:34:25.323, Speaker A: Big old play that's just six months and now it's ageless. Yeah. Appreciation. It's A model. It's a way. Yeah. Conversations and alignment and adjacent compilations of the dog and the amazing.
01:34:25.323 - 01:35:16.455, Speaker A: Yeah. Juke the nation. We united. We the greatest year. Allow us to welcome the co founder of Jupiter Show. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
01:35:16.455 - 01:36:07.395, Speaker A: Welcome to Break Point. I'm Siang from Jupiter. It's the wrong slides anyway. I think it will fix the problem. Should I keep going or should I. I mean it's a pretty cool video, right? The one that we were playing. Just.
01:36:07.395 - 01:36:58.455, Speaker A: Welcome to Breakpoint. I'm Siang from Jupiter. So I'm here to introduce you the Jupyter ecosystem. We call it the Jupyverse. The Jupyters consists of main three main pillars the Jupiter Platform, the Community and the Jupy Tokens. The Jupiter platform is one of the most comprehensive platform across all of crypto. It has three main products the Spot, the Pubs and the Launchpad.
01:36:58.455 - 01:37:41.305, Speaker A: It's also one of the most integrated network across all crypto system. Since launch the Spot product has done more than 300 billion in volume. It has generated more than 300 million for our partners and we have integrated more than 30 dexes. The perps product in 2024 has done more than 100 billion in volume and the GLP community is providing more than 600 million in liquidity for our traders to trade on. And we are doing all this thing with just three trading pairs. The Joobdao is also one of the most active and largest Dao with over 300,000 active Dao watchers. They engage in vibrant discussion and provide robust feedback for all the proposals on the Joob Dao.
01:37:41.305 - 01:38:17.105, Speaker A: Here I'm sharing three examples that Jupyverse is pioneering. We introduced the DeFi First Dynamics slippage. Slippage is the most confusing and ever changing user experience barrier for our users. The dynamic seepage provide real time slippage estimation based on different heuristic like trading pair size and marketing condition. It also provide MEV protections. Since the dynamic CPASE launch it has increased our swap success rate by a lot. We are doing this because we love our users.
01:38:17.105 - 01:38:52.895, Speaker A: We want to make sure that it's safe and convenient to trade on Jupiter next. We also innovated on this working model. We call it the Jupyter Works Group. The Jupyter Works Group are the execution engine of all the Jupiters. They are independent autonomous team from the community and they are accountable and funded by the Dao. They handle key community outreach, dao coordination and ecosystem growth effort. We believe this is the future of decentralized work and we want to bring this working model to more working groups around the ecosystem.
01:38:52.895 - 01:39:51.995, Speaker A: I think we would love to see working groups like the Developer Relationship, Video Production and Marketing Group next. We also pioneered this initiative we call JOOB Transparency Audit. We did the first Crypto Live Community Transparency Audit with all the community members live on Twitter. We went through every single transaction on the Gymnastics Wallet and make sure every single transaction is accounted for. This provides certainty, accountability and transparency to all the jupe holders. These are the examples that show what we believe in the core Jupyter's ethos to provide the most user driven experimenter platform, to have the most active engaged community and to provide the most transparent distributed token. Now I went through all the Drupal I would love to share five product updates.
01:39:51.995 - 01:40:31.285, Speaker A: First, the Metropolis API platform to provide to make developing on Solana a lot easier. The Metropolis API platform is the most comprehensive liquidity APIs with three main APIs. The token API is to provide a comprehensive token information verified by our community. Partners don't have to worry about scam tokens when they provide this token for their user to trade on. Second, the Price API. The Price API is an upgraded version of our very first API. Now it provides real time token data, trading data from Jupyter and also real time liquid data.
01:40:31.285 - 01:41:09.821, Speaker A: Last the Swap API. Over the years we have launched multiple features on the Swap ui. The new Swap API consolidate all the new cool features like Dynamic zippage and automatic Guest priority fees into the Swap API. We believe this will massively improve the partners platform for their users. With this all liquidity needs are in one single set of APIs. Next Jupiter IFQ we are launching Jupyter IFQ to make liquidity deeper on Solana. Today Jupiter Swap aggregates all the on chain liquidity to provide the best price for our Users with Jupiter IQ.
01:41:09.821 - 01:41:41.935, Speaker A: Top Market Maker will soon be able to provide their pricing codes directly into our routing engine. We believe with this and their liquidity we can make even better deeper liquidity on Solana. If you're a market maker out there, let us know. We would love to work with you to provide more liquidity for our users. Jupiter perps V2 to make Solana the best place for perps over the years based on our experience working on the perp product, we realized that on chain perv suffer with a few problems. First, low liquidity. Second, poor user experience.
01:41:41.935 - 01:42:32.475, Speaker A: Traders also need to deal with steel Oracle price high fees and high latencies. A multi prong approach is needed to solve all these problems. First we work with our key partners the GLP community to Provide ample liquidity for the traders to trade on. We work with risk managers like Gauntlet and Chaos to make sure that the market is safe and recommend good parameters for the purpose product to perform optimally. Last, to make sure the program and the product is safe and secure, we work with security auditors like offsite lab, AutoSec, NeoDym and Zachthree. With their help we managed to decrease the perps fee on Jupyter as competitive as Binance for trades that's more than a million dollar. Sometimes we even see better price.
01:42:32.475 - 01:43:21.773, Speaker A: Today I'm bringing three new updates to the perps product Limit Order. Limit Order is one of the most anticipated feature by our users. This is only possible because we are also bringing a massive UI update on the perks product next the DOF Oracle standards. So we are leveraging kiosk pricing data and using PIF as the backup Oracle. With the new DAF Oracle we provide lower latency high available pricing data even during congestion time. Since the launch of the DAF Oracle it has massively improved the trading experience for our users. And most importantly the DAF Oracle standard is an open standard.
01:43:21.773 - 01:43:59.535, Speaker A: So anyone here who loves to use the Oracle let us know. And last but I think the coolest thing that we are, I mean we are launching today the guestless transaction on Purps. Our keepers will take care of all the gas fee the traders are paying. That means trading on perps v2 you don't have to pay a single guest. This will make sure that the trading performance is much faster. Obviously the experience will be a lot better as well. With this we believe that we are bringing perps on Solana to parity with centralized exchanges.
01:43:59.535 - 01:44:42.717, Speaker A: Last Jupyter Mobile we believe to onboard million more users onto Solana we have to make. We have to remove all the friction to start using Solana. Over the years we learned a lot by creating our Swap API I mean Swap ui. We are consolidating all these lessons that we have learned to create. We believe the best swapping experience on mobile. We are doing this with three great features. Easy on ramp user can easily start swapping on the mobile app by using Apple Pay, Google Pay or credit cards.
01:44:42.717 - 01:45:37.325, Speaker A: Second one Tap Swap we believe one tap swap is the best shopping experience anywhere. All tokens are tradable immediately on Jupyter Mobile with the best price possible. With great features like dynamic sippage and auto priority fee. We remove all the confusing settings before the user need to set. I mean the user needs to set before they start the trading and journey with wallet Directly integrated into the Jupyter mobile we allow smart retries all fiat transactions will be retry automatically. Last obviously zero platform fee like our ui we think the Jupiter Mobile will be the most simple frictionless entry to onboard millions more users onto Solana to start their decentralized trading journey. And lastly April to make min coins fun again on Solana.
01:45:37.325 - 01:46:26.775, Speaker A: At Jupiter we believe mincoins are here to stay. I mean to boom on Solana we are making a massive upgrade to the APE platform that we launched a few months ago. We are calling it AP Pro. April has two main features Ape Trading and Apemin. Anyway the video is not playing. I'm going to walk, I'm going to go talk through it. So April requires zero seed phrases using our account extraction system even allows user to log in with Google.
01:46:26.775 - 01:47:27.785, Speaker A: April allows faster and better transaction for our app user using our keeper backend keeper infrastructure. APRO even provide top notch trading signals for our users to trade on. And APRO is also the cheapest across all the trading platform and it only costs 0.5%. And most importantly APRO works perfectly well on mobile so you can ape on the go. And last admin so token creator can easily mint new tokens using the admin UI with locking investing directly on the ui liquidity is locked directly on Meteorapool Token creator can earn fee perpetually. April is our commitment to make min coin trading creation and culture fun right here on Solana. Obviously we are Jupiter, we love experiments.
01:47:27.785 - 01:48:26.305, Speaker A: I'm also sharing three fun experiments that we are working on. First LFG v2 Since the pause of LFG v1 the team has been working very hard on LG v2 to push the AirDrop PCL and Transparency Meta forward. Our interns are also hard at work at the Fox initiative to token nice predictions and allow odds token to be freely traded on Solana. And a few months ago we announced the GUM initiative. Over the course of the next few months we will share more on the everything exchange on everything and not one, not two, I mean not one but two last things. We are announcing the acquisition of Solana fm, the most innovative Solana explorer, world class expert in Solana data infrastructure. We are also buying Coinhaul, the number one aggregator across Cosmo.
01:48:26.305 - 01:48:51.363, Speaker A: They have done 2.6 billion in volume with more than 225,000 users across 23 chains. We believe they are the best one of the best team. They are. I mean both are the best team in crypto. In summary, using Solana today is great but we are here to make using Solana awesome. With the Metropolis API platform we are making developing easier on Solana.
01:48:51.363 - 01:49:31.033, Speaker A: With the Jupyter RFQ we are bringing more liquidity onto Solana. With the Upgraded Jupiter Pubs V2 we are making perpetual trading great on Solana. With the introduction of Jupiter Mobile we believe that we can onboard millions more users onto Solana. And lastly April, I think we can make Meme coin fund again on Solana here we want to drive the decentralized meta forward together with the Jupiter United Planet. The cadets have been very helpful to push the Jupyter ethos forward. The user has been very helpful in giving us great feedback. The DAO are very active on the governance.
01:49:31.033 - 01:50:42.635, Speaker A: The team has been working very hard for all the great updates that we've been rolling out over the last year and obviously the work groups for pushing and expanding the jupyters here. I would love to. Thanks everyone. Thank you. Sa hi again. The podiums are out again. You know what that means.
01:50:42.635 - 01:51:34.541, Speaker A: We have one more debate for you guys. So is Solana more future proof than Ethereum? If we're in the audience today, what do we think? Yeah, yeah, that's your opinion. We're going to hear some opinions from the debaters. So we have Avichel on one side, we have Santiago on the other side, and the moderator of this debate is Ethereum or Solana. More future proof is going to be moderated by Ben from Solana Foundation. Hands up. How we doing? Break point.
01:51:34.541 - 01:52:11.201, Speaker A: How we feeling, huh? All right, we're gonna get right to it because we don't have a lot of time. So on my left I've got Santiago from SRS who is going to be the 4 candidate for is Solana Morphe future proof than Ethereum. And on my right in opposition Avichel from Electric Capital who is going to be opposing that. So to start things off, we flipped a hotel card in the back room and Avichel won the flip. So I'm going to give it to you first. The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to define future proof for you guys to make sure that we are debating the same points here. So Avicho, I'll hand it over to you.
01:52:11.201 - 01:52:38.515, Speaker A: All right, Belly of the beast. For the record, we have a lot of Solana. So this was not an Eth maxi coming into Solana breakpoint to argue for eth. Okay, kicking it off. Okay, let's define future proof. I would assert that being future proof requires both being able to mitigate risks to not fail today and be able to evolve towards the future as things change over time. And Ethereum is the only crypto platform that has demonstrated the ability to do this.
01:52:38.515 - 01:53:02.065, Speaker A: So maybe Solana will demonstrate it in the future, but it hasn't yet. So to make this more concrete, I think being resilient requires three things. The first is you need battle tested technology. The second is that you need a large number and a variety of applications. And the third is you need a large number and variety of users. Ethereum has all three and is therefore the most future proof platform. Let's start with the first battle tested technology.
01:53:02.065 - 01:53:43.453, Speaker A: Ethereum excels by being both decentralized and credibly neutral. It's the only smart contracting language that the US government has acknowledged is sufficiently decentralized to be not a security. It survived a Dow hack, it survived a transition from proof of work to proof of stake, major upgrades, a change to its economic model, attempts from governments to take it down, and it has persisted since 2015. It is not the best technology ever invented, no doubt, but it turns out neither was JavaScript and the Internet runs on JavaScript, so it doesn't matter matter. What matters is that it is sufficiently escape velocity with a network effect and so it has turned into the most battle tested platform. Second, let's talk applications. To be future proof you have to be able to have lots of applications.
01:53:43.453 - 01:54:10.839, Speaker A: So in effect what you need is a robust market because you don't know what's actually going to work. You just need a lot of people trying to see what's going to work. Ethereum is clearly the most future proof here. Per Electric Capital's developer report, we know there's almost 9,000 monthly active developers in Ethereum's open source ecosystem and likely 20 to 30,000 working on closed source applications. On top of Ethereum, things like custodians and wallets. This is 10x bigger than any other ecosystem. These developers have also created and established a number of data standards.
01:54:10.839 - 01:54:59.683, Speaker A: So things like ERC 2721, ERC 1155 and that's a tremendous moat. So as developers and custodians and wallets and institutions snap to these standards, it further establishes this network effect and this trend you see in thousands of developers having created so much tooling that ecosystems like Celo and Avalanche and Polygon have snapped to the EVM and moved over because of the significant network effects around Ethereum's developer ecosystem. So this tremendous network effect I think has led to the largest number of developers and the most significant network effects for any ecosystem. Which makes it the most resilient and therefore the most future proof. Third, let's talk users. The killer applications for blockchains all revolve currently around programmable money, store value, moving money with code, capital formation clearly are the killer use cases. Ethereum excels at all of these.
01:54:59.683 - 01:55:40.557, Speaker A: It has the greatest diversity of user types. It has the deepest liquidity from users. It has 250 million wallets, often has over a million daily active wallets, has hundreds of organizations from Microsoft to JP Morgan which is running an eth fork to government, has 50 billion in TVL, 150 billion in stablecoins has BlackRock. It has a billion dollars of Treasuries on chain. It has the most KYC users. And so whether you're looking at the raw number of users, you're looking at the different types of users, from developing markets to degenerates, to global financial institutions to governments, or the depth of liquidity on chain, Ethereum is clearly the most future proof. So in summary, being future proof requires being able to avoid critical risks and failing today and being able to evolve into the future.
01:55:40.557 - 01:55:58.429, Speaker A: This requires evolving across the technology on both supply side of the market with developers and on the demand side with users. Ethereum has demonstrated far better than any other chain that it can survive risks and evolve across all three of these dimensions and is therefore the most Future proof. Boom. 30 seconds. Back to you Saty. All right, Satya, let's see ya. Thank you.
01:55:58.429 - 01:56:35.065, Speaker A: I definitely agree. Look, the purpose of blockchains is very clear. It is their asset ledgers. And the killer use case is to transact and exchange financial assets. And I think the best way to do that is in a low latency single shared state machine, period. Why? Because you reduce arbitrage and you hear Anatoly say time and time again it is NASDAQ on the blockchain. And I appreciated this, you know, at parify when we were investing in defi, I mean that is the killer use case and Solana is that single shared state machine and far superior than Ethereum.
01:56:35.065 - 01:57:13.455, Speaker A: And so if you, if you believe that and you extend further into the future, then you see a path towards Solana being more future proof because that is the killer use case of blockchains. There's some interesting applications beyond that, you know, the coordination aspect of governance and whatnot, but the vast majority and the killer use case of blockchains will be to transact in exchange financial assets. And so therefore Solana is just purposely built for that and therefore more future proof. Now of course, in this argument, you could say, okay, MEV is a problem. And Vitro might say that. I think you could. I would argue that MEV is a problem for every chain.
01:57:13.455 - 01:58:01.363, Speaker A: You know, just users and Dapps don't have that much agency to control MEV today. But I would argue that there are mechanisms that are being developed that will solve toxic MEV in Solana and therefore, you know, will improve the user experience. And so, and by the way, Ethereum also and other chains also have a huge MEV problem. This. So that's from first principles, you have to sort of believe that. The second argument is, you know, from a consumer standpoint, an integrated experience that Solana delivers is vastly superior than the current fragmented state of Ethereum. You know, you have USDC on Solana when you, in ethereum you have 10 different flavors of USDC.
01:58:01.363 - 01:59:08.873, Speaker A: And so you can imagine a consumer just the amount of headspace that that requires that it's so confusing to think about 10 different versions of USDC across Arbitrum, Starquare, scroll and the many other L2 L10s, L1 hundreds that will exist in Ethereum. And so to me, I think the state of the industry is one where we built infrastructure for the last 10 years plus the most important thing right now is, you know, there is excess supply, there's not enough demand for block space. And I think we're entering the consumer application of change that were really stress tests and prove where users actually can transact where they enjoy. And I think clearly if you take a look at the last year, it's very evident that that is happening more in Solana than it is in Ethereum. And I think that that is the most important thing. I think you time and time again you hear the criticisms of Solana, which is, oh, you know, there's higher hardware requirements and it's, you know, from a decentralization and security standpoint that's problematic. You know, only very few people can run a validating node.
01:59:08.873 - 02:00:09.159, Speaker A: I think we tend to think of the trilemma as like binary. The more important thing is when you think about there is sufficient decentralization, there is sufficient security on Solana, the most important thing then becomes throughput because that is what delivers the best experience for the consumer. And so if you actually invert, you say, okay, if consumers are going to continue to flock because they like the plucked meme coins or they're using a deep end application, then that translates into more demand for block space, more fees, and at a unit economic level for a validator, it will be vastly more profitable than in Ethereum because it's purely predicated where the demand is for block space. And that today is in Solana and will continue to be, is my thesis. And so that is really the key, the core of my argument. I think we have a little bit more time, but I'll keep it short because I think we've been in a state of the industry where it's highly philosophical. We haven't really hit, I guess, mainstream adoption.
02:00:09.159 - 02:01:30.813, Speaker A: But I think my thesis is that over the next year or two, or perhaps even sooner, it will be very evident the have and the have nots as we kind of reach, escape the and likely it's going to be deep in. And again, the more, the more, the more future proof chain is one that will be able to attract users and delivers the best consumer experience to transact financial assets. And that very clearly, while there are more developers in Ethereum, I think you have to sort of put it into context. It's just been around longer, but from my portfolio, it's just not only from a user perspective, from a developer perspective, are you going to build on one of the tens or twenties of L2s or are you going to build on the chain that is quite simply the fastest and the cheapest and where most users are? And I think the answer is very clear and therefore it is just more future proof. Great, great arguments. Okay, so you, you guys both have. If I can summarize crudely for both of you, Santiago, you're under the impression that the place where you're going to have the more future proof blockchain is going to be the place where it's easier to transact and easier to build these types of applications whereby most of Avichel's arguments have been around the staying power of Ethereum and the moat that it has developed.
02:01:30.813 - 02:02:03.605, Speaker A: So Avichel, I want to give you an opportunity quickly to respond to Santiago's points. And then Santa, I'll give you a time to rebuttal before we switch sides. Great. I think that it fundamentally comes down to whether or not you think the network effects matter. More users, more developers, more activity, more institutional adoption, more liquidity, more support for custodians, more support from governments. Pretty deep moats to try to overcome as a second player. And so, you know, I think the best technology doesn't necessarily win the Internet of, you know, the Internet shows us as the history of technology shows us.
02:02:03.605 - 02:02:47.933, Speaker A: And so, you know, people may not like it, but the reality is Ethereum has got the most network effects and it's not going anywhere. I think network effects are vastly overstated and so are first mover advantages. Like what are network effects in open source systems? It's just, I think it's the first mover advantage is vastly overstated and vastly overrated. I think the more important, important aspect, like take Deepin for example, I think that's where you'll see probably the most clear modes. You have already Helium and you're going to see other projects that are, you know, like dawn for instance. And so you can think about like if you're a user it's very like Deepin is the application where you have the most amount of kind of like concretely usage. Right.
02:02:47.933 - 02:03:30.309, Speaker A: And so if you're using a Helium mobile plan, you already have a wallet that's loaded with Solana. And so probabilistically, are you going to want to go to another chain or are you going to use the variety of other Deep in applications that are going to be deploying in Solana? I think the answer is pretty clear right at that point there's really no reason to go elsewhere. And so you can envision, to me that's it's really hard to like place. Oh, there's moats at the moment, there's more TVL on Ethereum. I would say that that's like vastly overrated because we haven't really seen mainstream applications. But as I said, you know, we're entering a consumer phase of this industry and it's going to be very clear where the best technology will win. And the first mover advantage of Ethereum is going to be less and less relevant.
02:03:30.309 - 02:03:52.887, Speaker A: And that will be very evident in the next year or two. All right, well with the time we have left, we're going to switch sides. Boom. Steel man, I'll give it to you. Steel man, the Solana side. Okay. I would assert that if you think about these things through the proper venture lens and startup ecosystem lens and early technology lens, what you should be looking at is not the Y intercept but the slope.
02:03:52.887 - 02:04:31.117, Speaker A: So I would assert that Solana is becoming more future proof more quickly than Ethereum. And that's what matters. So first let's consider the technology. Just like Ethereum, Solana is now battle tested, survived outages, DDoS attacks, the FTX collapse which sucked liquidity out of the system, SVB collapse, the Japanese yen prices and much more. And so it's shown it can survive tremendous stress to the system and cross that first threshold to say it has some staying power. And so if we look forward, the question is which of These ecosystems is becoming more resilient more quickly. Now to cert that because Ethereum has made some bad technical decisions, it's creating technical debt which is going to cause it to be less resilient going forward.
02:04:31.117 - 02:04:58.845, Speaker A: So first, for example, the EVM is fundamentally busted. It's unscalable. The memory model for solidity is busted. It's a patchwork of hacks. It's so much a patchwork of hacks that actually teams like Monad are creating an entire new chain to try to fix this problem. Thinking about scaling via L2 is also May not be future proof because it breaks one of the most interesting aspects of running in a shared 1L1 space, which is atomic composability of transactions. And so if we want composability but not just interoperability, we could use centralized databases.
02:04:58.845 - 02:05:34.917, Speaker A: Why use an L1? It's for the composability. And so sharding is actually anti future proof because it breaks what makes Ethereum so special. So what we have on the technology is an excellent start, but fundamentally not scalable and taking an approach to scaling, that's breaking what makes it special. Meanwhile, Solana's tech is much more scalable and much more future proof. Second, if we look at developers, I would assert that quality measures matters much more than quantity. Solana is now effectively a top three ecosystem in developers, despite launching years after Ethereum and having only gone through one bull market rather than two. I would also assert that 20k developers for Ethereum is a drop in the bucket compared to the 3.5
02:05:34.917 - 02:06:12.823, Speaker A: million Rust developers in the world. I would also assert that Rust has some key properties that make it uniquely well suited for smart contracts such as type safety for performance. So Solana has this robust ecosystem of companies and if you look at the slope instead of the Y intercept, you realize that the company is making decisions in 2024 about where to build, such as Visa that were Stripe are choosing Solana instead of Ethereum. I would also assert that when we think about being future proof, we need to think not just about defi, but where the use cases will be going forward. So if you look at Fortune 1000 company, yes, financial services are very important and prominent, but so are energy. So are telecommunications, healthcare. These are all massive industries in the GDP that need blockchain technologies.
02:06:12.823 - 02:06:39.673, Speaker A: And Salon is clearly leading in these new verticals with projects like Helium and so many other deep end projects people here know so about being future proof. Solana is winning in the new use cases and industries that are at least as Big as finance. Third, if we look at users, I think we can look at history to understand why slope matters much more than why intercept. Google was not the first search engine. Facebook was not the first social network. In fact, MySpace had 50 million users when Facebook got off the ground. And so what matters is building the right thing and growing quickly.
02:06:39.673 - 02:07:11.851, Speaker A: Solana has hit 5 million daily active wallets. More users on Solana use NFTs than on Ethereum. More Solana users are playing with meme coins and culture than on Ethereum. Solana on many days has more stable coin volume and defi volume than Ethereum thanks to low fees and faster throughput. And so the TVL may be lower, but I would argue that having lots of idle capital sitting on chain is not the right way to look at this. We should be looking at this through a lens of capital efficiency. The Ethereum ecosystems actually have a misguided focus on tvl which shows that it's not future proof because the future of defi is about volume and capital efficiency, not idle capital.
02:07:11.851 - 02:07:37.973, Speaker A: So when it comes to users, yet again Solana has shown that the Y intercept does not matter. It's actually slope that we should be paying attention to. In summary, if we look at the key dimensions on technology, applications and developers and user activity, we see that Solana has caught up and actually has a much steeper slope. And so over the next four years its growth and slope will actually overtake Ethereum's. That's it. All right, good stuff, Santiago. Yeah, thank you.
02:07:37.973 - 02:08:10.943, Speaker A: I think concretely, like there's two reasons why I think Solana might not be more future proof. The first one is liveness. Right. Hopefully Fire Dancer gets announced relatively soon. But if you again, if you take the most important thing is from a user centric standpoint, that is the most important thing for being future proof. If there continues to be liveness issues then I think it would degrade trust both from developers and users as well, just degrading the user experience. So I think no one can disagree that like more client diversity, you know, provides more guarantees, more assurances for developers and improves the user experience.
02:08:10.943 - 02:08:48.395, Speaker A: So if there be a catastrophic bug or you know, I think there's less Lindy and I would agree with Avichel, there's just certainly less Lindy with Solana. And so hopefully Fire Dancer can deliver on that. But if it weren't or it doesn't for whatever reason, then I think we ought to just kind of go back to the drawing board and really reassess because there is going to continue to be more and more competition. There are other high throughput chains that are well capitalized, well resourced. And so I think there's, you know, as this industry continues to grow, it will just attract more competition. So it's important to really lean in, into that. And the second issue is I think toxic mev.
02:08:48.395 - 02:09:30.979, Speaker A: You know, obviously there's a lot of criticism on Solana, you know, with Pumpkin Fun and Meme Coins. When you have more diversity and more assets that are being, you know, launched in these chains, it lends itself to a lot of mev. The MEV that is most important, like there, there will always be mev. And I think it's important to make that distinction that the one that is most problematic is sandwiching attacks. It is front running attacks because that really degrades the user experience. And so if you are a user aggregator, if you're a BlackRock, if you're a financial institution, if you're a PayPal, you really look to that and say, you know, I'm not really sure I want to deploy in somewhere like Solana because it has a lot of toxic mev. I'm like less concerned around that.
02:09:30.979 - 02:10:12.201, Speaker A: I think as I said in my opening, every chain has a problem with this. I just think that because Solana is attracting more of these type of assets, particularly you know, Meme Coins, it's just become more important for Solana to really deliver on solving toxic mev. There's projects that are trying to build this, but if for whatever reason, you know, the current state of affairs is just not going to fly, I think it's just more and more important to really focus on solving toxic mev. And again like MEV will continue to be like it's going to be a thing with these chains. There's always going to be arbitrage opportunities. It's just this toxic mev. And so it's really important for Solana to solve that.
02:10:12.201 - 02:10:32.449, Speaker A: And I think if that doesn't happen then it might just really, you know, be problematic and not be as future proof as I, as I think it will be. So that's really it. I mean I'll yield my minute to Avichel if you want to refute. But you know, I'll keep it left curve I guess. Anything else? Avicho? Otherwise I'll close this out. I rest my case. All right, well thanks everybody for joining us.
02:10:32.449 - 02:10:45.555, Speaker A: I guess I'll use my minute. There is a point. There's a poll, hopefully next year in Breakpoint. We have go to go to real time Live voting. I'd love to know if. But yeah. Anyways, there's a, there's a poll on Twitter so please go vote who won.
02:10:45.555 - 02:10:59.459, Speaker A: Go to Santiago. What's your both Twitter handles. I am ennybitcoins. I also retweeted it. Please vote on the poll and see who won Driver of the day or debater of the day. All right, thank you all. Enjoy Breakpoint.
02:10:59.459 - 02:12:18.085, Speaker A: Thanks. Stop. So this is my last announcement with you guys. It's been fun sharing this experience with you. Alex from Super Team will be taking over as your MC after this segment. So a few months ago, something really major happened for Solana. PayPal USD announced its support for the Solana ecosystem.
02:12:18.085 - 02:12:58.407, Speaker A: In case you don't know how big of a deal that is, we have two guests or maybe three here to share how big of a deal that is with you. So allow me to introduce Jose from PayPal and Shiraz from Solana Foundation. All right. All right. Good afternoon, Breakpoint. Good afternoon, Singapore. Are you guys ready for some payments content? It's coming up.
02:12:58.407 - 02:13:28.625, Speaker A: All right. Hey everyone. No one better to start off the payments content than Jose Fernandez Duponte, the SVP of crypto at PayPal. Thanks so much, Jose for, for joining us today. Thank you for having me. Before we get started, I think there is a moment for us to pat ourselves on the back or congratulate ourselves because this was a very monumental thing that happened. We had one of the largest payments companies in the world issuing on Solana as basically the first chain.
02:13:28.625 - 02:14:16.065, Speaker A: I mean, eth l1 is like our Devnet, right? Like you practice some stuff on eth, but then when you want something that really works, you run it on Solana. Solana is now the canonical chain for PyUSD. It's the more PyUSD issued on Solana than Ethereum and it was one of the fastest growing launches of any stablecoin on Solana. So let's make some noise for this. So Jose, we've discussed this in past forums, but maybe just kind of starting at first principles, can you discuss why PayPal decided to issue a stablecoin and why on Solana is the second part of that question. I think it's a three part answer. PayPal has obviously been in payments for the best part of the last 25 years and we are in crypto and we are in digital currencies because we are in payments.
02:14:16.065 - 02:14:58.095, Speaker A: This is the first time if I myself have been in payments for 20 years. If you look back at FinTech innovation, 90% of that has been innovation in UX and innovation in fraud, not a lot has been innovation on fundamental payment Rails. So when we started to explore blockchain protocols and we look at, oh, we can actually move value here between countries instantly, we can move it at a speed that is 26 times cheaper than ACH, that is 400 times cheaper than Chex. And this was about four years ago. So I say it will take a while. But this is too important for us not to have a chip on the table. So that's when we started to support Crypto on the PayPal and memo apps in a few countries.
02:14:58.095 - 02:15:31.561, Speaker A: That's when we started to go with our stablecoin project that went live last year. The first chain was Ethereum. We all know that Ethereum is not the best solution for payments. When we were looking at the primitives, if you're in retail payments, you need to be able to do a thousand transactions per second at least. And you need to do a few other things that are, that differentiate a payment from a transaction. Sometimes when you're on the crypto side, people talk about payments when actually they're only talking about moving value from one wallet to another wallet. There is a ton in addition to that that you need to do.
02:15:31.561 - 02:16:03.243, Speaker A: There is a, you need to manage chargebacks, you need to manage confidentiality of transactions. So it was very easy. When we're looking at where do we go next and what is the right chain for payment to look at. What you all were building is not only the speed and it's not only the throughput who are important is we will talk about token extensions. Token extensions was a big, big driver for us. Very cool. So I think one thing I want to, I want to quickly go over what PayPal brings to the table because I think there are sometimes two camps of people.
02:16:03.243 - 02:16:30.645, Speaker A: Some people that are in payments get super excited about PayPal because they understand the assets that it brings to the table. Other people are like, well, whatever, it's another stablecoin. So very quickly I want to talk about some of the assets and then I want you to tell me like, which of these you think are you're most excited about? So let's start with. We've got the PayPal wallet. 400 million users globally. PayPal checkout, 30 million merchants. Basically, we've got Braintree, we've got Venmo with 90 million users.
02:16:30.645 - 02:17:08.243, Speaker A: You have a PayPal credit product. You've got Zoom, which is a remittance business. You have Hyper Wallet, which is a platform for global payouts. You have Zettle, Which I didn't even know about, which is a mobile pos. So I think some of the things that people get excited about is this great array of assets. I know it's a long process and a big company to start integrating. Where do you see sort of the roadmap and which of these assets do you think are sort of the low hanging fruit? So for all of you in the room who are building a need based main capabilities for what you are building, think about there will be obviously and there are other stablecoins on Solana.
02:17:08.243 - 02:17:41.800, Speaker A: There is not another one that has enabled for transfer extensions. So think about that for token extensions. So think about that as well. But the uniqueness of building on top of BUSD is getting access to the PayPal to Site and network. All those assets that the Shiraz were talking about are many that we don't really talk about. But think of where do you have a stablecoin that can be deployed for 400 million consumers, that can be deployed for 40 million merchants, that moves billions in remittances cross border. All that is going to be available over time.
02:17:41.800 - 02:18:21.915, Speaker A: One of the reasons that we decided that we were not going to design that there is not a PayPal blockchain, we didn't go want to go permission. We wanted to build on open source because we don't operate on the, on the blockchain side and we don't operate on the protocol side. We operate on the application and the UX part of it and we want our engineering teams to work on deploying our stablecoin into each and every PayPal property that you can find out there. And it's going to take us years. It's not, not everything is deployed right now. But we believe in open source technology. We believe in deploying the places where developers are building and we believe in making our network available to others.
02:18:21.915 - 02:19:03.560, Speaker A: So kind of on that vein, I mean we, there's a lot of people talk about how do we get crypto to mainstream. There's a lot of chatter about base and base's ability to leverage, you know, 70 million Coinbase users. I see PayPal as the ability to have a beautiful on ramp, you know, seamless on ramps to get you know, 300 million users. So where do you see that? Because right now I think the on ramps there's some limitation geographically but like I think that's to me that like the vision of onboarding all these hundreds of millions of people into crypto that's a roadmap problem, is not a scientific problem. Those things will happen. Amazing. Now think about it.
02:19:03.560 - 02:19:49.755, Speaker A: I think that you make a very, very good point. The population that uses PayPal is basically this. Think only about for instance the US the population that uses PayPal is not a population of people who are already crypto adapters. They are not crypto experts, is the population of the US and so if you want to get access to something that is very, very mainstream, you need to be into the big platforms. And I do believe that you will see over time more and more use cases that might be just regular fintech and payments on the front and stable coin on the back and stablecoin will be used to a settlement as a settlement layer. I have a ton of respect for the coinbase folks and what base is doing and what others are doing. I think it's really, really important that those ecosystem exist.
02:19:49.755 - 02:20:32.097, Speaker A: But where we help is in bringing that into the mainstream. The fact that when we started our crypto product way back in 2020, 70% of the folks who were interacting with with our crypto product who were buying Bitcoin on the Venmo wallet, we were their first crypto experience. They had never interacted with crypto before. So having experiences that are gateway experiences that get the mainstream economy and mainstream users into digital currencies is something that is a fundamentally important B something that you need to go and find them in the platforms where they are. Got it. You mentioned you talked a little bit about token extensions. We have limited time so we won't talk about all the different features that can be enabled.
02:20:32.097 - 02:21:33.171, Speaker A: But I think confidential transfers is probably one of the killer use case or one of the killer features in payments, particularly for institutional and enterprise users. Where do you how differentiated a value prop. Do you see that in payments or how necessary do you think that is for payments stablecoin payments to go from where they are today, which is just the tip of the iceberg to, you know, becoming much bigger in enterprise payments. We are in the market every day selling enterprise clients on stablecoin. One thing that we have realized very quickly is that the first client that you have at an enterprise is the cfo, is not the head of E commerce, is not the head of marketing, is the cfo because that's where the value is the most evident when you're taking to someone and you can move money here at a fraction of ascent, you can settle on weekends, you can repatriate funds from cross border. It's a very rational conversation to have what you're not going to convince. The CFO is a users to distribute payroll to your employees.
02:21:33.171 - 02:22:17.379, Speaker A: And by the way, each and every transaction is going to be posted on chain and people can see how much you're paying or you're a public company and you're accepting payments on a stablecoin. Hedge funds out there are going to be able to to see your transaction activity before because everything is posted out there. So confidential transfers are absolutely something that is part of the MVP that you need to be able to build payment products for enterprises on top of stablecoins. Got it. So our audience tends to skew to developers, builders, startups. What do you think is missing out there? Obviously PayPal is then 900 pound gorilla but there's huge industries of small companies that can build around. Right? That always happens in fintech.
02:22:17.379 - 02:23:21.459, Speaker A: Anything you would encourage people to look at any categories like what any messages to the developers out there to build on PyUSD. And I can tell you what we are very focused on because I think that's where adoption will happen first. We are spending a ton of time in cross border. Cross border payments is probably where adoption will happen first. We are spending a ton of time on B2B use cases and enterprise use cases and we are spending a ton of time on the CFO side of the house and to do that and there's a place where I would encourage developers to look into once that you have the substrate one that you have the blockchain and the features on top of the blockchain that you all have have built. You need to reduce the friction for the folks who are going to be building on the enterprise side when you're looking at payments. One of the reasons we enabled very recently ENS for on chain transfers on the PayPal platform because it is important that users have a human readable way to direct payments to one another.
02:23:21.459 - 02:23:58.467, Speaker A: But there are going to be other things that will be required. Integration between something that is very important is to give institutions and enterprises and small businesses an easy way to hold digital assets. The accounting treatment is difficult. A CFO doesn't want to be involved in whether they need to mark to market the digital assets because the price is going up or down. An integration with existing platforms, the fact that you need to make it easy for a corporate user they will not run a different tax ledger to deal with your product on stablecoins. They will not integrate with a keypad, a spreadsheet on the site. It has to be integrated with ERPs.
02:23:58.467 - 02:24:26.807, Speaker A: There is a ton of work in that middleware between enterprise grade payments products and the blockchain. Where there is a ton of space for the community to go and build. We got a couple of minutes left. One good example of PayPal eating its own dog food, as they say, is PayPal Ventures. And we actually have a special guest. We were talking a little bit about how venture funding could sometimes benefit from. Just in time.
02:24:26.807 - 02:24:49.737, Speaker A: You have an anecdote about somebody closing around and needing the funding right away. First of all, public service announcement. I don't need to tell these to this crowd, but if you all are racing, we tell that our ventures team tell that to all the startups if you want to get a check from PayPal. We don't do checks anymore. We do on chain transfers to wallets. So that's. And as you were saying, we were making an investment in a different company.
02:24:49.737 - 02:25:12.763, Speaker A: We were going through due diligence and the like. The closing happened on a Friday evening after banking hours. The company wanted to announce the round on Monday morning. There was no way that we can get the money there through wire transfers or banking rails. So we just send them stablecoin and hit their wallet. Lawyers were happy they announced the round at on a Monday morning. If not, it would have held up the announcement by a few days.
02:25:12.763 - 02:26:02.805, Speaker A: And so with that I wanted to invite Omer from Chaos Labs who is the most recent recipient of PayPal Ventures funding. Sir, thank you, thank you for having me guys. Really excited to be here. I'm Omer Goldberg, I'm the founder of Chaos Labs. We're a leader in on chain risk management. So we have the privilege of working with the biggest decentralized applications on Solana with the biggest X Jupiter, aave, DYDX and GMX as well. Recently, last week we announced the launch of Edge Protocol which is a price, risk and proof of reserves Oracle meant to facilitate the growing defi economy across all the chains.
02:26:02.805 - 02:26:25.501, Speaker A: We launched it with Jupiter and have already processed over $40 billion in transactional volume. We're really excited about it. And what's even more exciting is that we got to build it with our long term partners, PayPal in mind. And your fundraise came via PyUSD and the fundraise what your fundraising is your check. You didn't get a check. You got PYUSD for your. Well, exactly.
02:26:25.501 - 02:27:04.415, Speaker A: And you know what's really great? When you're aligned with your partners and how excited we are for everything that's being built in the Solana ecosystem, we decided to do this investment a little bit differently. So instead of writing a check in the traditional sense, the folks at Paypal made their first investment on Solana with PyUSD, which was completed several days ago. So this is a new one and it's just a testament to how excited we are for everything that work that's being built in the growing Solana ecosystem. For anyone who's going to be here later today, if you're interested to speak about Oracle's risk management AI prediction markets, we're going to be here. We'd love to connect. We'll be here after this. Thank you guys.
02:27:04.415 - 02:27:28.993, Speaker A: You got a video to show? Oh yeah, I think there's an animation to show the, to show the investment itself. There we go. An additional 4 million in PyUSD to the 60 million Series A which we previously announced a few weeks ago done on Solana. Thank you to PayPal, thank you to the foundation. Proud to be investors. All right, thanks everybody. Thank you.
02:27:28.993 - 02:28:08.775, Speaker A: Thank you guys. Thank you. Jose, thanks. All right, thank you so much to our speakers from Chaos Labs, PayPal USD and Solana for the great conversation. Up next we're going to have three keynotes back to back, so please stick around. They're five minute rapid fire sessions so you do not want to miss the alpha. Stay in your seats.
02:28:08.775 - 02:29:17.435, Speaker A: And up next we've got Mike Udak, CEO and co founder of Sling Money. Hi, how are you? My name is Mike, I'm co founder of Sling and I'm here to demo for you the money button for the world. We think you should be able to send money to anyone in the world whether they're next to you or 3,000 miles away instantly. And that's what we built at Sling by integrating Solana stablecoins and real time payment networks all over the world. We have a few principles for how we build this. The first is that you should be able to pay anyone anywhere. The second is that it should be incredibly easy to use, it should work instantly and it should cost a lot less than traditional money transfer products.
02:29:17.435 - 02:29:48.405, Speaker A: And I want to start by just showing you a demo of my co founder sending money from Europe to Kenya. This is Simon. He's sending 7,000 shillings worth of USDP to Caleb who's in Nairobi. 7,000? Dude, that's generous. So cool. Withdrawn. And then I'm going to check my m pesa 10 times.
02:29:48.405 - 02:30:40.275, Speaker A: Cool. It arrives straight from Europe to M? Pesa in less than a minute. I and the way this works so you can add money, we've done a ton of work to integrate all sorts of different instant financial systems so that you have a very simple, very consistent experience all over so that was Apple Pay. Here you have adding money with M Pesa and this is, we don't just do M Pesa, it's actually a ton of mobile wallet providers all over Africa. And you just enter your M Pesa PIN and you've got your SDP in your wallet. And to add in Brazil, it's also just super easy. It works slightly different because Pix works differently than these things, but you just copy that string, you paste it into Nubank or whatever bank you use in Brazil and pronto the money is in your Sling wallet.
02:30:40.275 - 02:31:22.455, Speaker A: And then to send money to somebody else, everybody on Sling is in the directory and you can just search for them, you can denominate your transaction. Whatever currency you want, we calculate in real time how much USDP to send to them and you send and you're done. And it's that easy. And then they can offramp, do whatever they want with it. And to send to somebody who doesn't have Sling, you just send them a text message with the money on it to one time use self custodial Solana wallet that they can off ramp from directly across our footprint. And withdrawing money from Sling also super easy. So this is withdrawing euros with SEPA Instant and it's done.
02:31:22.455 - 02:32:07.429, Speaker A: If you're in Jamaica, you can just send a push payment to your Jamaican debit card. And this is instant. This is so fast that the money is in your bank account in Jamaican dollars faster than you can switch apps. And here you are with shillings again into M? Pesa, which you already saw a little bit beautiful and simple and with pics. And I can't tell you how much work it is to integrate all of these so that they basically work the same and they're instant all over the world. And Sling under the hood is a self custodial wallet. We really believe that you should own your own money.
02:32:07.429 - 02:33:11.705, Speaker A: So you know, you can get your key, you can copy it, you can paste it into Phantom, you can do whatever you want. It's all yours. We have no access to the key whatsoever. And you know, we gave a demo about a year ago at Breakpoint in Amsterdam and some of you have been testing Sling for us over the course of the last year and we've heard your feedback, which is that, well, everybody just asks us like can we add stablecoins? And as of today the answer is yes. So you can just get your wallet details from Sling, you can send some USDC in and there it is. And you can withdraw on Solana as well with USDC and USDP and the way we've done this, you know, we've seamlessly integrated a self custodial wallet with stablecoins and fiat payment rails all over the world, which means that when you sign up you have to kyc, but it's incredibly fast, it takes about a minute, really easy to do. And as a result of that, we've got instant ramps across 75 countries so far, with a bunch more coming soon, including the US imminently.
02:33:11.705 - 02:33:59.725, Speaker A: And now that we have interoperability across the Solano ecosystem, we also support wallets and exchanges in another 75 countries, which means together the directory and instant transfers work across 150 plus countries. And we just think that this is a really important thing. We think everybody in the world should be connected to an instant global financial system. We think that this has the potential to be incredibly impactful for a lot of people. You know, if you can send a text message to anyone in the world, if you can send a photo to anyone in the world and they get it instantly and it's free, you should be able to do the same with money. And we're just really excited. Please download Sling, give it a shot, you can get in code breakpoint and please let us know what you think.
02:33:59.725 - 02:34:38.955, Speaker A: Thank you very much. All right, thank you, Mike. Cannot wait to get started with Sling. Up next, we have Stein Pauman, CEO and co founder Helios. Hi everyone. Super great to be here. So I'm Stein, the CEO and founder of Helio.
02:34:38.955 - 02:35:28.145, Speaker A: Crucially, not to be confused with either Helium or Helios. That's a very common mistake in this ecosystem. So we want to show you something new that we've been working on. It's going to help our merchants customers use crypto checkouts in new, innovative ways to drive millions in sales. So when Jim and I started Helio two years ago, our main goal was to deliver crypto checkouts to the masses. And since then, we've onboarded 6,000 creators, merchants and developers that use Helio to sell digital goods, subscriptions, e Commerce to over 750,000 unique buyers. We've grown our payment volume from near zero to over a billion on an annualized basis.
02:35:28.145 - 02:36:15.779, Speaker A: All right, so when we started, the main drivers behind the pay with crypto narrative were still Bitcoin and Ethereum. We launched with a Solana first strategy because it makes sense to use the cheapest and fastest rails for payments. However, on our journey, we've learned something that's even more important. The number one reason why merchants choose Hideo on Solana is because they want to reach new customers and new communities. Yes, they love speed, yes, they love low cost, but they like selling more, even more. And that's really the killer feature of checkouts on Solana. And that's now becoming a very large opportunity indeed.
02:36:15.779 - 02:37:10.935, Speaker A: So as decentralized wealth grows and we have tens of millions of users with digital currency in their wallets, they're going to want to spend some of that. And that's the crypto commerce market opportunity, which is 8 billion today, growing to 30 billion over the next few years. And that's the opportunity that we unlock for our merchant customers. We help them reach those digital dollars with seamless on chain checkout solutions. And we do that through Helio branded pay links and checkouts. Can you put your hand up if you've ever paid on a heliopay link or a checkout? About one third of you. So we see that as a really, really easy way for people to spin up a payment and instantly accept USDC or hundreds of other currencies.
02:37:10.935 - 02:39:08.961, Speaker A: And then we also offer fully integrated white label checkout solutions. Integration into Discord for selling memberships, integration into YouTube for paywalling, DEX Screener, Magic Eden integration, and of course the Solana Pay plugin for Shopify. Over the past year we've helped hundreds of Shopify brands reach new customers, new communities, and We've seen over 75 million in real sales through the Solana Pay plugin web two brands like Brian Johnson's Health Regime or of course hardware products like Hivemapper, Keystone Helium and of course Solana Mobile. Today we're taking that one step further and we're allowing our Shopify Brands customers to sell directly from the virtual town square. Today we're introducing Blinks for Shopify. Let's take a look. SA let's go.
02:39:08.961 - 02:39:38.535, Speaker A: Can I have a round of applause for that? The team did an amazing job. I think so. Can't wait to get this into the hands of our customers. Starting next week, we've also extended our suite of Web3 features for customer loyalty. We've seen the Seeker announcement yesterday. With a single click in the Helio dashboard, you can now offer a discount for your product or service to any seeker holder. So that's a group of 200,000 crypto fluent customers that you can reach at the click of a button.
02:39:38.535 - 02:40:24.725, Speaker A: You can also include airdrops in your purchase like non fungible or fungible tokens. And also if you have your own token, you can deliver ultimate utility by enabling it as a method of payment. In Shopify, I Think this is another great step towards our mission of making crypto payments accessible to everyone. Thank you for joining us today and please come and see us at booth number B7 to learn more. Thank you so much. All right, thank you so much, Stein. Next up we've got Erbil Karaman, co founder of Huma Finance.
02:40:24.725 - 02:41:13.855, Speaker A: Hello everyone, my name is Abi Karaman. I'm co founder of Human Finance, the first PayFi network. Let's first define what payment financing means. Payment financing is the trade of time value of money. The vast majority of business and people around the world today depend on a form of payment financing. Credit cards alone facilitate $16 trillion in merchant payments. Trade finance enables $10 trillion in business to business payments.
02:41:13.855 - 02:41:55.825, Speaker A: One in every six families depend on remittances. Money sent back home cross the borders. And that system alone depends on trillions of dollars locked in pre funding accounts. The list goes on and on. And while the demand for payment financing is increasing every passing day, the financial institutions are unable or maybe unwilling to fulfill this demand. What do we do? It is so ingrained in our lives that without payment financing the entire economy stops growing. Crypto was supposed to solve this problem.
02:41:55.825 - 02:42:43.893, Speaker A: We introduced Bitcoin to solve peer to peer payments. Stablecoins improve user experiences and accessibility. Helped get us to a point where today the stablecoin payment volume is comparable to the Visa network. However, it's not enough. If you really want 100x the growth of payments, we need payments financing, a form of payment financing that leverages blockchains and stablecoins natively. And that's what we call if we can give people the control of when to get paid and when to pay, that is financial freedom. How do we make this happen? To answer that question, we need to go back a little bit.
02:42:43.893 - 02:43:15.783, Speaker A: We need to go back to the beginning of Internet. When we first started using networks. Networks were called Internets. These were proprietary networks that didn't talk to each other. A few visionaries came together and defined what we call OSI model, an open systems interconnected model that was built for the Internet of data. And with that we have Internet today. It's a seven layer architecture that has actually created this interoperable network.
02:43:15.783 - 02:43:54.505, Speaker A: And with that for the past 30, 40 years we have enjoyed so many innovations, our lives are reshaped. So to solve the problem of payment financing on chain, we thought about the same model applied to the Internet of Money. We published an article defining the PayFi stack. A six layer stack. On the bottom you have a transaction layer, L1s and L2s. Solana is one of the best. On top of it, you have the currency layer, you have custard layer, the wallets, you have compliance layer, financing layer and the application layer.
02:43:54.505 - 02:44:30.841, Speaker A: All of this can define an open model for us to create the payment financing. Leveraging blockchains and stablecoins. Us at Huma are focused on the financing layer. The financing layer is about connecting capital, demand and supply. It deals with risk and assets, pricing, structuring, tokenization and distribution. If you think about what this enables, it enables things like digital asset backed credit cards. It enables trade financing with verifiable invoices.
02:44:30.841 - 02:45:13.371, Speaker A: It enables deepin machine financing, cross border payment financing T solutions that work 247 because financial institutions don't. The PayFi ecosystem has been growing. There are many amazing applications that are gaining momentum. I don't have the time to go into every single one of them, but you should check them out. So far Kuma has done more than $1.9 billion of Pay FI transactions, growing 10% month over month with $0 of credit default and with more than half a billion dollars of demand in the pipeline per month. Think about this.
02:45:13.371 - 02:45:51.613, Speaker A: Think about the curve of this growth and how faster we can grow if we can fulfill all of that demand. The exciting news today is the stream of protocol is coming to Solana. We have been building a pretty sophisticated platform in the Ethereum ecosystem and in a few months we're launching on Solana. It is the most advanced RWA protocol to ever launch on Solana. We love Solana foundations focused on PayFi. We love this ecosystem and we are putting all of our efforts to grow this together. PayFi is a new front of RWA.
02:45:51.613 - 02:46:18.957, Speaker A: If you think about defi, it all happened for too long. Unsustainable yields coming from Ponzanomics and dilutionary emissions. With Ondo and others, we credit this our delay. Season 1T bills bringing yield, yield, real yield. But with the Fed cutting rates aggressively, that's also going down. What we need is to support the business and people around the world with sustainable yield. Double digit yield coming on chain and that's possible with autoblade.
02:46:18.957 - 02:46:38.435, Speaker A: Season two that's possible with PayFi. Let's wake up. It's pay five time on Solana. Come talk to us to become a lunch partner. Let's fucking go. Thank you. All right.
02:46:38.435 - 02:47:17.093, Speaker A: Thank you, Erbil. Lfg indeed. All right everyone, we have a very exciting fireside chat coming up, so please do not go anywhere. We're about to kick off, so be seated. Hello. Hello. I'M Alex from Super Team.
02:47:17.093 - 02:47:52.127, Speaker A: You may recognize me from Twitter. If not, come talk to me about anything around Solana in the Middle East. If you want to come to Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Saudi Arabia, I'm your guy. How's everyone feeling about the biggest break point yet? Can I get a little bit of energy after all those product talks? Great. Yeah, I'm having a blast. Amazing to see everyone here IRL also very, very excited to introduce our next Fireside Chat. So, between two titans of our industry, I think everyone knows Visa.
02:47:52.127 - 02:48:42.447, Speaker A: I'm sure you've probably got one of their cards in your pocket. And then how many people have heard of Fireblocks? If we're going to get a show of hands, a little bit more if, you know, you know, kind of institutional player. But we've got today Kai from Visa, who leads their crypto business, and we've got Goldie from Fireblocks. So please join me, give them a warm round of applause as they join us on stage for what is, I'm sure going to be a very interesting Fireside Chat. Thank you. All right, everyone, I'm gonna sit down in a second. You can sit down.
02:48:42.447 - 02:49:11.141, Speaker A: But first of all, I don't know if you've noticed, I'm wearing a Stablecoin is bigger and better than Fiat. Do you agree? Alright, perfect. This is a great segue. So my name is Goldie. I manage the payments division in Fireblocks. And if you don't know us, we're probably one of the largest platforms out there for anyone who's building digital assets. But today, more important than Fireblocks, we have a legend with us.
02:49:11.141 - 02:50:10.825, Speaker A: So I know, don't be embarrassed, but if you don't know Kai, I'll give you a really brief intro about him. So Kai Sheffield joined visa in 2015 through the acquisition of a company he was part of called Trialpay. Now, Kai could have sat in Visa, Rest Invest, you know, get his, get his great equity from Visa, but actually, no, he decided he's learning a lot about payments at Visa, but he was also super curious about crypto and he noticed that the people in Visa that knows a lot about payments have no idea what all of us are doing in crypto. So he became this amazing bridge at Visa, but he was so good at it that he actually created Visa Crypto with his, obviously with his colleagues. And today they're probably the largest entity out there that, you know, you would probably. We all call them the incumbents that are doing crypto. So please give another round of Applause for Kai Sheffield.
02:50:10.825 - 02:50:35.819, Speaker A: Thank you, Kai. Thank you. It's great to be here, for sure. Thank you. And, Kai, you know, the first thing, and I'm going to talk faster because we don't have a lot of time, but, Kai, you know, I'm sure that, you know, your family was super proud of you when a company you were part of was acquired, you became part of Visa. You led, you're leading a team. But did you tell your parents you're doing crypto? How did they feel about this? I did, and surprisingly, they loved it.
02:50:35.819 - 02:51:21.623, Speaker A: Like, I got my dad down the rabbit hole, and so he's a huge supporter, which is amazing. Amazing. And I think the first thing I want to ask you, like, you know, Visa, everyone thinks of Visa as, you know, it's all about cars. And I think when Dee Hawk, the original founder of Visa, did he think that we'll be here in a Solana conference talking about crypto? I think that he did. I mean, I think Visa's got one of the most amazing corporate histories. If you're not familiar with dehawk in the early days, the Fresno airdrop, I think when Visa was created, it wasn't designed. Was it set up to be a credit card company? You know, De Hawk talked about in the 70s, you know, that the future would have electronic value exchange, that money would move across the world, you know, instantly at the speed of light.
02:51:21.623 - 02:52:01.243, Speaker A: And so I think in many ways, you know, Visa's pioneered, you know, wave after wave of digital payments. And I think crypto is just, you know, the next wave. And one part of that that we're excited to participate in. Amazing. And this is a great segue because we were talking, you know, we're here at Token, right, And you and I, we know each other for probably like six years now. We've been to a lot of crypto conferences. Me personally, again, managing the payments part in Fireblocks, I see hundreds of payment companies, and over the last week only I've heard probably, like, I don't know, a dozen pitches on half of them are how we're going to this intermediate Visa, and.
02:52:01.243 - 02:52:50.557, Speaker A: And yet you're here. Visa is doing crypto. Are you guys doing this as a hedge, or do you really believe this is the future of payments? We see it as a huge opportunity and we think about it in a few ways. One, we see more and more demand for stablecoins all over the world. But if stablecoins are going to move from just a store of value that people are using to get access to dollars to Actually being able to be spent and have utility, you need to have merchant acceptance. We think it's going to be a long time to get 100 million plus merchants across the world to update point of sales to figure out how to manage acceptance. And so we think one of the biggest opportunities is linking a Visa credential, working with the next generation of stablecoin wallets, and making it as easy as possible to tap to pay with Visa spending from a balance of stablecoins.
02:52:50.557 - 02:53:40.785, Speaker A: So we've got a bunch of amazing partners that we've been working closely with. And then the other way that we think about it is we care a lot about many different payment flows. And so we don't just think about consumer to merchant, we think about B2B, we think about P2P. You know, how do businesses do disbursements to consumers? And so I think it's a lot of those new payment flows that are really challenging, particularly cross border, that we think there's a huge opportunity for blockchains and stablecoins to become a new payment rail. And so we're really focused on how can Visa be this connection point for our clients, enabling them to move value over existing payment rails today and new rails that emerge in the future. And particularly as the speed and scalability of networks like Solana has emerged, we think there are more and more things that you can do on chain with payments and more payment flows that that starts to open up. And so we're really excited.
02:53:40.785 - 02:54:29.419, Speaker A: A lot of the growth of Visa, it's not just going to be consumer merchant and stablecoins fit into a lot of it. Okay, so that actually touches on the use cases and I want to double click on that because, you know, a lot of people think that, oh, when you say payments with blockchain, it's just, I don't know, it's just people paying with Bitcoin or whatnot. Obviously that's not what it is. Right. And I'm happy to share from Fireblocks, out of the 200 companies that we have doing payments, I think again, out of the $20 billion a month they're doing, I think more than half of that is cross border. What we call the stablecoin sandwich, right? When it starts with Fiat, goes to stablecoin, moves back to Fiat, you at Visa. And again, this is one of the things that I really admire about you guys doing is that you created an on chain dashboard.
02:54:29.419 - 02:55:16.543, Speaker A: You recently had this survey that you released like a week ago about emerging markets. Can you share from this dashboard from the survey, what are like the top insights that you saw that we need to think about as like emerging use cases and most, you know, the most interesting ones. Yeah. So we've been doing a lot of research and analysis and one of our goals is we work with 15,000 financial institutions across the world. This space is new to many of them and so we're trying to help them understand that stablecoins are real, they're here to stay and how are they being used? So we spent a lot of time looking at on chain data. We've had some amazing partners, Allium Labs, we worked together and put up a dashboard@visaonchainanalytics.com and we're really starting to see different payment behavior based upon the chain, based upon the stablecoin.
02:55:16.543 - 02:56:02.887, Speaker A: For example, with Solana, we've seen about 65% of stablecoin transactions at Solana are actually under $100. And so it's happening a lot, kind of lower value transactions more frequently where Ethereum. It's just not cost effective to be able to do that. And so we've been following these trends on the on chain data side very closely, putting the dashboard up as a public resource for the industry, for policymakers. And then we've been talking to customers. So we did a survey, talked to customers in Nigeria and India and Indonesia and we found that, you know, over half, you know, of these customers are planning to increase the stablecoin usage going forward. And so there's more and more demand and we've particularly seen markets like Nigeria that Solana is getting more and more penetration in.
02:56:02.887 - 02:56:48.693, Speaker A: There were about 40% of the customers we talked to, they were using the phantom wallet. And so we've seen the opportunity in emerging markets is very real. Today we're excited to figure out how can we partner with the companies building that space and help enable them to grow. And is a lot of that on the consumer side? Again, if you look at all the insights that you guys have, is it more on the consumer side? Is it more the B2B that are starting with Fiat but ending with a digital asset and settling like commodities? It is the stablecoin sandwich. Where do you see the meat on the bone today? Yeah, I think it's both. I think what's exciting 2024 has been kind of a turning point year where we started to see some of the first non crypto businesses. They have nothing to do with crypto, but they have challenging payout problems that they're trying to solve.
02:56:48.693 - 02:57:39.345, Speaker A: And so they want to do disbursements to freelancers. That's one of the biggest use cases that we see over and over of freelancers in Nigeria, in Argentina. They want to get paid and they prefer dollars. And so stablecoins are becoming faster, cheaper ways for global companies to pay freelancers in those markets. And then I got to give you credit, you coined the stablecoin sandwich over a year ago and we've seen seen that more and more where a lot of the payment volume across the world, it's happening from one bank account to another bank account. And so the question is, can stablecoins become a backend payment rail? Can you stitch together stablecoins for cross border with local domestic RTP rails, you know, pics in Brazil for example. And can you create these experiences where a business or a consumer sends dollars in the US it lands as pesos in Mexico, but it uses a stablecoin on the back end to do the cross border leg.
02:57:39.345 - 02:58:35.121, Speaker A: And we think that's a huge opportunity to modernize account to account cross border pivots. No, I agree and I see a lot of companies starting to do this and I guess the other thing that a lot of companies are doing now, and I don't know, maybe by a show of hands, half of the people now here are issuing new stablecoins right, right now. And again you all know tether is at I think 130 billion, USDC is at 35 billion. And yet every day I open the news I see a new stablecoin. Do we need all these stable coins? Are we going to see a future with 100 USD, you know, pegged stablecoins? Yeah, I think it's exciting to see more stablecoins coming to market, experimenting, trying to differentiate in different ways. It seems like today most of the use cases, you know, people are explicitly using the stablecoin. They know what the stablecoin is.
02:58:35.121 - 02:59:25.595, Speaker A: There is some direct to consumer brand, whether it's USDC or usdt. But we think there are many other use cases that could just happen on the back end where the brand doesn't matter and then it's all about, you know, the economics, it's, it's the features of how the stablecoin works. And so you could have many different stablecoins that are used on the back end of wallets but the consumer doesn't have to have, have any association with the brand. And then a handful of large stablecoins that have kind of broken through as the brand that people use interoperating between these wallets. I think we're also excited to see non dollar stablecoins, you know, right now it's 99% of the total supply. They're dollars. And we think that there will be every major fiat currency represented on chain and a lot of the payment use cases, you know, dollars are great for cross border but you then you need to be able to convert quickly and efficiently and there's a big role for other local currency stablecoins to play in that.
02:59:25.595 - 02:59:56.301, Speaker A: I think that that's going to grow over the next few years. No, I completely agree. And again, the way we look at fireblocks is we really believe that we're at this inflection point right now and what we see is that we're at this I guess phase where we're moving from sporadic exploration to massive experimentation. Right. Even just looking at what we're seeing in the market. Three years ago we had 10 payment companies doing something on blockchain. Today we have the 200 companies doing something on blockchain.
02:59:56.301 - 03:00:12.103, Speaker A: It's, it's a big shift. Right. I hope that I don't know how many PSPs, how many banks you work with. More than 15,000 if I remember correctly. I hope we see all of them coming online in the next five years. Right. We don't have a lot of time today unfortunately.
03:00:12.103 - 03:00:31.263, Speaker A: So I'm going to do something that. I'm sorry if I haven't prepped you for this because you know, Visa obviously asked me to send all the questions ahead of time but I couldn't send this one. But so this is going to be a quick fire, rapid. I'm going to say a term you're going to say first thing that comes to mind. Okay? Okay. Okay. And I'm sorry, Visa.
03:00:31.263 - 03:00:52.591, Speaker A: I apologize. So Bitcoin, Digital gold, Stable coins, Future of payments, MasterCard. Sorry, scratch that. AI and blockchain. I know I said both of them together. I'm actually excited about the intersection. I think how AI agents are empowered to spend I think is a fascinating area.
03:00:52.591 - 03:01:26.697, Speaker A: Still very early, but I think there are a lot of cool things coming out of it. Solana ecosystem, it's an amazing ecosystem. I think the number of developers that we're talking to, you know, building products that, you know, they're not crypto products. They're not, you know, focused on someone that, you know, is just looking to speculate and trade. They look and feel like the next generation of fintech where, you know, a mainstream consumer can make payments, you know, can store value. And I think we're seeing more and more of that coming out of the slot. On ecosystem and looking to support and work with as many companies in the space as we can.
03:01:26.697 - 03:02:16.113, Speaker A: And having only about two minutes left. Visa Crypto is not just about stable coins. It's also about tokenization of real world assets. It's also about everything else we're doing. And you know, I don't know if you guys, you know, the previous person was talking about PayFi and credit. That's also something that I'm sure you guys are exploring between payments tokenization and again, the other things we can do with this new infrastructure. What is the best thing that you think that we all should focus here? Yeah, I think right now one of the roles that we're looking to play is we spent a lot of time working with crypto companies, trying to bring Visa's products and services into the industry and then adapting them, making them more flexible.
03:02:16.113 - 03:03:12.807, Speaker A: Looking at, we're settling with USDC on Solana today with a handful of partners and looking to grow that significantly. And then we're trying to really help enable and empower banks. And again, that's really been the core business that Visa has been in. We think that banks have to play a major role in any financial ecosystem and there's fundamental value in blockchain technology. And so we're trying to say, how do we take examples of what's working on the frontier in defi in and crypto and then make that accessible and find ways that banks can participate in it. And so we want to be that enabler and really bringing banks on chain. And so we're really excited to find partners and look at opportunities to take things that have worked in crypto and figure out how do you professionalize, institutionalize it and get it to the point where you could have much, much larger financial institutions that could start to use the same information infrastructure.
03:03:12.807 - 03:04:01.649, Speaker A: Kai, I really appreciate that you had the brave to come here on stage for this Fireside Chat and I really appreciate the fact that we can have a conversation where we're talking about Bitcoin decentralization and banks at the same time. And for you being that bridge, thank you for everything that you guys are doing at Visa Crypto promoting this and thank you amazing builders. I was, I was Goldie from Fireblocks and please enjoy the rest of the day. Thank you, Kai. Thanks for having me. All right, if you're getting up, that's the right thing to do because it's time to eat. You're in Singapore, a place known for its culinary traditions.
03:04:01.649 - 03:04:22.575, Speaker A: Amazing food. So we've got a ton of hawker Stalls set up just outside here. But don't stay too long. I need you back here at 2:20pm for a very, very interesting debate. You don't want to miss it. So you've got roughly 40 minutes. See you back here 2:20pm See you.
03:04:22.575 - 03:50:30.049, Speaker A: Dream high in the quiet of the night you know that I caught it bad Bad boy Shiny toy with a price you know that I bought it Killing me slow out the window I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below Devils roll the dice Angels Sa sa sa sh Sa sa sa sa sa sa sa sa sa sa sa sa sa sa Perfect. So hopefully you're all feeling refreshed. I see some more people filtering. Please come in. We're about to kick off as scheduled. So we've got some great post lunch programming for you. First up is a debate, very, very interesting topic.
03:50:30.049 - 03:50:56.029, Speaker A: And then we're going to have more of those rapid fire keynotes. Everyone's liking those rapid fire formats. I'm loving this 5 minute format is like keeping the energy high. So very excited to see more of those. But first, before you hear more pitches from founders, we're joined on stage with a star studded lineup here. The debate is about Wall street and whether it needs blockchain or not. A topic really close to my heart.
03:50:56.029 - 03:51:53.059, Speaker A: The reason I'm in crypto, actually I would definitely argue for that. Wall street does need blockchain and could stand to gain a lot. But we're going to let Christopher Jensen from Franklin Templeton and Anthony Scaramucci duke it out on stage, moderated by Leo Wald who is formerly at Valkyrie, is now at Seoul Strategies. So please get energized, welcome them on stage for very, very entertaining debate. All right. Hi everybody. So this debate is going to be a lot of fun.
03:51:53.059 - 03:52:36.381, Speaker A: I come from a boxing background, so I have told them they're allowed to take the gloves off, but there's a couple rules. So as we know, Wall street and Defi have really gotten married in certain ways this year and especially on a lot of projects around tokenization. Originally, fund tokenization was the holy grail, a liquid portfolio to liquid. But a lot of projects have come out since that are even more innovative. So starting the debate on my right side, Christopher Jensen, director of digital asset research at Franklin Templeton. He's going to take the bear case and fight against Anthony Scaramucci, founder and partner of Skybridge and Salt. And off we go.
03:52:36.381 - 03:53:07.337, Speaker A: So Christopher, why doesn't to tokenization projects need a blockchain? I mean, why are you so Negative. Well, I'm negative against the stance that Wall street doesn't need blockchain. So the way I see it is blockchain. It's not a replacement, but an augmentation that can help with a second. He brought notes. Wasn't that the assignment? You're like the Donald Trump with debating. I mean, you're not supposed to break notes to these things.
03:53:07.337 - 03:53:27.273, Speaker A: All right, go ahead. Keep going. As I was saying, look at. I got no notes here. Okay? All right, go ahead. Go ahead, Jensen, go ahead. So the way I see it, right, Is blockchain is a necessary tool to help level up the current system.
03:53:27.273 - 03:54:21.305, Speaker A: I mean, we're all aware of Coinbase's great advertisements, you know, up the system. So, you know, I'm arguing that blockchain isn't a replacement or a substitute for Wall street, but it's a necessary ingredient for Wall street to take that next level because it helps address some of its current inefficiencies. Ultimately, I think it helps reduce risk and because of the underlying technology, actually enables new use cases and new opportunities for innovation. Okay, so I'm obviously the oldest person on the stage, so I'm channeling my Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler, two people that I absolutely can't stand. So for those of you that are for tokenization, forgive me, but the issue that Wall street is going to have with everything that you just said is that it's totally unnecessary. We've already got a system in place. We have Rails in place.
03:54:21.305 - 03:55:24.055, Speaker A: We have a system that has withstood the test of time over 90 years since the SEC was developed. We have the deepest, most liquid capital markets now in the world, primarily because of US Leadership and regulation around the world in combination with the Fed. And so there would be absolutely no reason to change a system that is working so well. And one of the things that could potentially happen if you move to a tokenized system is how do you unwind trades in a tokenized system? Let's say that there was a trade error. Let's say I called my broker and said, you know, the person made a mistake or I got pricing execution wrong. How do you send things back over the blockchain if we tokenize everything? Hold on. Do you ever respond switching sides? Do you want to respond to that or switch? Yeah, so it's a good point.
03:55:24.055 - 03:56:08.999, Speaker A: So the way I look at it, right, is that there are a few key parts of the value proposition, and they will segue right into that. So one is like, what do blockchains enable? And we get Asked this question a lot at Franklin Talmilton. Right. I'm on the investment team and a lot of times people are like, you know, but what's it all for? What is the value of a blockchain? And one mental model that we use is it decreases the cost of trust. And how does it do that? You're able to remove intermediaries from the system. So, you know, we have examples of this in our own business where we've removed an off chain, you know, transfer agent by putting it on chain and realized savings upwards of 30,000%. Right.
03:56:08.999 - 03:57:09.815, Speaker A: So that was our aha moment, which made us kind of double down on this. I think you're getting to the point, you know, there's an immutable ledger underpinning all this and yes, you might be able to settle and clear transactions faster, but how do you unwind something that gets encoded into an immutable ledger? And I think what we're seeing is experimentation being done in the space. So there are obviously private blockchains working to solve these problems. We've actually chosen to build on open permissionless chains. Very important to us. And I think the permission, say defi activity or authenticating via kyc aml, or even the instance of you're settling your dash processing transactions off chain, you have an opportunity to unwind the trade, but then you can batch process, settle down and it gets recorded onto the base layer. I, you know, I don't think we have a silver bullet yet, but there's different, you know, iterations of this solution that give us, you know, encouragement.
03:57:09.815 - 03:57:37.021, Speaker A: Take your suit off for a second, Respond to that or no, feel free to respond. And then I have a question. Just quickly. So did anybody understand what he said? Let me channel Trump in the Biden debate. Do you think he understood of what he said? Because I didn't understand what he said. And that's the problem with the situation because the average person that you're trying to get into the investment world to buy stocks and bonds is already frightened enough. You just went through something that nobody would really understand.
03:57:37.021 - 03:58:34.965, Speaker A: But if you said to somebody, let's say you were an FA somewhere, you said, okay, we're going to buy you stocks, we're going to use the dtc, we're going to put them in your account, you're going to have Q SIP number. The system has worked for 90 plus years and you don't have to worry about it. Moreover, because of the way the system is set up, we have something called the securities Insurance Protection Corporation that's Going to protect every one of these things. How is the securities Insurance Protection Corporation going to protect transactions over the blockchain that may or may not be unwound? Would you like to respond? Yeah, I think, I mean, look, we obviously there's a lot of kind of cutting edge firms like leading the charge here, but even, you know, kind of legacy institutions. The dtcc, you know, is exploring ways that this technology can help, you know, you know, increase efficiencies in its business. And I think, you know, yes, a lot of things do work. I come from a credit background.
03:58:34.965 - 03:59:27.641, Speaker A: Distressed debt, private credit, and you know, leveraged loans actually take 15 to 20 business days, so the better part of a month to settle. So we would buy and sell and be out of the trade. And the initial part of the transaction hasn't even settled yet. You know, right now there's airplanes whizzing around with physical checks. So I think, you know, I think a key part of this too is you don't have to solve everything at once. I think what we're seeing and what gives us, you know, encouragement is it iterative process taking one piece of this system and upgrading that one piece rather than attempt a whole overfit at once. So take that suit off for a second, you're walking down the street and why does it matter and who does it matter to? All these innovations of financial products using a blockchain.
03:59:27.641 - 03:59:57.043, Speaker A: Am I arguing the other side now or no? Okay, all right, so I'm going to take the other side now. So I think it's an unbelievably great idea to tokenize everything. Okay, so let me explain why. Okay, there are three major reasons why we want to tokenize everything. Number one, let's face it, we don't like and we don't trust each other. And so for the last 5,000 years, we've had third parties verifying transactions. But the problem in the securities industry, it's not one third party.
03:59:57.043 - 04:00:27.805, Speaker A: It's actually seven or eight different parties. And so if you buy stock from my account, it's got to go through seven different entities before it ends up in your account. When I joined the industry 35 years ago, it was trade day plus five. I think we're now down to trade day plus one. But there's a tremendous amount of friction in the situation. And so once we clarify earnings able to unwind error trades. This system is actually a flawless and near perfect system.
04:00:27.805 - 04:01:26.333, Speaker A: And hopefully the tokenization will happen on Solana. And I say that because I'm talking my book, because I own a lot of Solana and I believe it will, I think it eventually will. And I will leave you with this thought about how important this is. There's $7 trillion spent globally on transaction verification and the credit card industry, wire transfers, et cetera. Just imagine if we can start tokenizing things and take third parties out of the equation, use the distributed network to trust each other and take that $7 trillion and put it back into the economy. So I'm actually really for it and I'm glad I'm now art arguing for it because I am actually really for it. But what I said before, if you don't mind me just saying this, what I said before against it is actually how The Fossils, the 200-year-old people in Washington think about it.
04:01:26.333 - 04:02:13.433, Speaker A: And it's incumbent upon everybody in this room to help the politicians get over the fossilization of the old world and move us into this new standard. Okay, go ahead, Sorry. So continuing on tokenization, you're against it now? You're, you don't like. Go ahead, continue to debate. And the other question I have for you as well is in regards to tokenization, how much does on chain transferability matter to the success of a tokenized fund and tokenized project? I think it's. And I'm arguing with that or going along with that, right. I think it's incredibly important not just to be able to transfer.
04:02:13.433 - 04:02:56.865, Speaker A: I mean this is part of the backbone of why we're all here, right? This new set of Rails and this new system that we're talking about, if it's static, it actually does no good. It's imperative that it be able to move and move quickly. Quickly. I think another key component is the ability to self custody these assets. And so that gets trickier, right? As we're starting to blend the traditional finance system, you know, with the more crypto native system and they come together and assets from both worlds travel on the same set of Rails, you know, how do you self custody those. Which is again part of the ethos of crypto and why we're here. So I would, I would say yes, very important to be able to transfer to self custody.
04:02:56.865 - 04:04:09.065, Speaker A: And then, you know, we shouldn't just be trying to replicate existing systems on this new layer, you know, this, this new infrastructure, but really use that technology to unlock and see what's possible with new use cases. Would you like to respond? I would, I want, I want people to imagine a future where we've got these issues solved and you own things on your phone that are completely Tokenized. And you may end up owning things like your shares of Starbucks. They could be on your phone and you could walk into the Starbucks and talk to the barista. And maybe Starbucks has a share repurchase program going on where they're buying back their shares and they offer you a 20% discount on the coffee if you take your phone out and you, you tap their wallet with your wallet and you transfer your shares of Starbucks back to the company in exchange for the goods that they're providing. And it's just one example of where the future could be in terms of tokenizing things. And what I know from my life experience being on Wall street is there are so many things in the market to stress.
04:04:09.065 - 04:04:56.997, Speaker A: That is one of them, as Christopher mentioned, that is illiquid. It's unwieldy in terms of the way we handle this stuff. But in the world of tokenization, there's probably, and I did this estimate a few years ago, so forgive me, the information is a little bit dated, but there's probably 60% of our assets that are actually not liquid. You know, the stock and bond market, generally liquid ETFs are liquid, but our real estate, our art, our rental income properties, there's a whole list of things probably 60% of the world is illiquid. But through tokenization, we can liquefy those markets. And if we can liquefy those markets, we can make them way more efficient. And if we can make them more efficient, we can make them more affordable for people.
04:04:56.997 - 04:05:19.993, Speaker A: And so for me, this is where the opportunity is. If we want to have a fair and freer global society, we have to spread the wealth. And one of the things that the blockchain does is it creates a much flatter, much freer, more libertarian society. So I'm for all of those things. I appreciate that. As a follow up. Well, actually, everybody started clapping there.
04:05:19.993 - 04:05:56.825, Speaker A: Well, you hit the gong, you can hit the gong. It's actually very heavy. So as a follow up on that, certain firms have been trying to do this and have done this for at least four years with Whiskey with Wine. You know, now we're in the stage of different real world assets and those tokenized funds. Why is it going to work this time? Why is it different? Well, okay, so one of the big issues that we have is the regulatory blockages. And so every time someone. We have the technology, we have the technology to create these things.
04:05:56.825 - 04:06:56.085, Speaker A: I'm standing here, I hope to be at Solana Breakpoint 2025, where we have a Solana ETF. Okay. Now everybody in this room says, well, that's probably not possible given where regulation is. But if you're an entrepreneur, you want to go from zero to one and we have to tackle this at the regulatory side. And so all of these things that are now working, we can go back to regulatory blockages more than the technology itself. And I think unfortunately you had this experience with your Bitcoin cash etf, you know, you were delayed capriciously and arbitrarily by the SEC as a result of the politicization of regulation. So one of the things that we have to do in our society is not make the regulation left leaning or right leaning, but how about right or wrong as opposed to left or right? And if we do that, these things are ready for prime time and we can create this liquidity.
04:06:56.085 - 04:07:30.513, Speaker A: Fantastic. And response in addition to the regulatory point, which can't stress enough. I don't know if I'm supposed to agree with you, but I do obviously is the, you know, just because you tokenize something doesn't entail liquidity. And so I think what we're seeing is some great proof of concepts being run and different types of, you know, kind of one off assets being tokenized, brought onto these new sets of rails. But you know, whenever we look at a tokenization use case, there's the technology piece that's becoming easier. Easier. Right.
04:07:30.513 - 04:07:59.009, Speaker A: And then there's if you're going to do it in a regulatory compliant way, maybe that's sometimes more challenging depending on what market you're in, what jurisdiction you're trying to navigate. But the third piece is just as important as these two. And it's, and we see this in defi. Right. Like there's a great innovation, but if that's not connected to the rest of the ecosystem, the flywheel doesn't start. And so we see this at the convergence of tokenization as well. Just because you bring an asset on chain doesn't necessarily mean the liquidity is there for it.
04:07:59.009 - 04:08:35.821, Speaker A: So integrating it into the rest of the system, opening up new demand use cases for it, enhancing its utility. I think these are just as important to get the flywheel effect going. Absolutely. And a follow up to that, you did speak about jurisdictions, what, you know, differences do you see from what we've seen with the SEC in the United States to we're sitting in Singapore right now, the Asian climate is obviously very different. Singapore specifically. Specifically, what are you seeing? Yeah, and so that actually relates back to our, you know, I guess proposition that we're debating. Right.
04:08:35.821 - 04:09:24.085, Speaker A: Does Wall street need crypto. And if we think about the Wall street that you and I both worked on actually in New York, in the United States, you know, Wall street absolutely needs crypto because without crypto it's going to become less competitive on the global stage. And so, you know, we're definitely taking inspiration from what's happening here in Singapore, in Europe. I just came from a week in the Middle east which was extremely constructive, hearing how they were thinking about things. A gentleman from Japan was just talking to me last night about, you know, the latest advancements in their thinking and acceptance and adoption of this asset class. So I think, you know, all of these hubs and cities and regulatory jurisdictions are keeping each other on their toes. And those that aren't open minded will really fall behind from a competitive standpoint.
04:09:24.085 - 04:09:49.295, Speaker A: I agree. And I've seen you in Korea, I've seen you in many different countries. So, you know, what's your take on. I know we just have a couple minutes left. So what I want to say, I think one of the exercises that is super important is to take the other side of the argument. So we're here at Salata Break, so most of us, if not all of us, are bulls. I don't think there's too many people in this audience that short Solanum.
04:09:49.295 - 04:10:32.365, Speaker A: But you have to understand the other side of the arguments. In markets, you have to understand the other side of the arguments as it relates to a regulator. And I think it's very, very important to do that. If you do, you'll make your arguments more compelling. You'll be able to maneuver in a way that that's more progressive for all of us and advancing the technology. And I think, unfortunately, this space, whether it's crypto in general, Solana specifically, or bitcoin, there is a generation of people that are still in power, specifically in the United States that don't understand it. And so therefore, as a result of not understanding it, they don't like it.
04:10:32.365 - 04:11:10.481, Speaker A: And so I would just suggest to people, don't be suspended, dismissive of those people. Go out and talk to those people and try to allay their fears by first understanding them. Christopher, final thoughts. Just a second. That, you know, again, we're supposed to be opposing each other, but you know, and I guess to underscore right, you know, as we're traveling around, we do hear a lot of different perspectives. And as we know, this industry and this asset class evolved so quickly. So people who used to think they had a finger on the pulse, you know, that pulse might be from 18 months ago, which as we know in crypto time, you know, that's ages ago.
04:11:10.481 - 04:11:33.907, Speaker A: So I think, you know, it's important to understand the other side, be open minded. Someone might think they're totally up to speed on the latest innovations, both on the technology side and on the regulatory side, but really try to, you know, discuss it in a non combative, tribal way, even though we're all big Salana fans. Well, gentlemen, shake hands. Thank you guys. Thank you. Real pleasure to be here. Thank you.
04:11:33.907 - 04:12:01.765, Speaker A: You're the best. Thank you so much. Thanks. Great job. All right, thank you so much to our debaters and moderator. I mean, to me it was very clear that that was arguing a very strong case for the tokenization of everything on Wall Street. But I'm probably preaching to the choir.
04:12:01.765 - 04:12:57.931, Speaker A: If you want to weigh in on that debate, you can actually find some signage around the venue where you can also cast your vote of which debate won. So, yeah, look for the chomp signage around with the QR code or find KZ and ask her how you can do that. And don't go anywhere because we have probably one of the most anticipated keynotes of Breakpoint. I'm asking you to bring on, with a huge, huge round of applause, chief scientist from Fire Dancer, Kevin fucking Bowers. Thank you. A lot of lights. Okay.
04:12:57.931 - 04:13:17.545, Speaker A: They already announced. I'm Kevin Bowers, chief scientist of the Jump Trading Group. But it's been two years since I presented on the Breakpoint maiden stage. Or I guess the left stage nowadays. Thanks for having me back. The title for today's talk is Fast Forward from Frankendancer to Fire Dancer. This talk summarizes the last two years of work by the Fire Dancer team.
04:13:17.545 - 04:13:51.395, Speaker A: The team is now quite large. So large I don't have space for all of them on this slide. You can find many of them here by their colorful shirts. We unfortunately don't get many opportunities to talk to a broad audience and we have a lot to say to. To that end, we have several events this week at this conference and its siblings. These other events go deeper than we'll have time for in this talk due to the usual Tetris like scheduling challenges. You might have already seen Michael and Phillip's hello World Talk at Block 0.
04:13:51.395 - 04:14:36.075, Speaker A: They've given me one hell of a tough act to follow. Let's start with a snapshot of what we said at breakpoint 22. What is fire? Fire Dancer is a new Solana validator in development in the open at the above link, we all know the importance to the community's long term health of having multiple documented, standardized, robust and performant validators. We were honored to get this opportunity. It's like other projects we've done, but with several novel technical aspects. We thought it would be a challenge and we were flattered that people thought we were up for it. This graph of commits versus time shows that since then we've been continuously doing the work and at an accelerating pace.
04:14:36.075 - 04:15:33.525, Speaker A: We've been pleasantly surprised at the level of attention that this work has received. To get some idea of what all of those commits are about, here is a slide from Breakpoint 23 a CPU nowadays is akin to many single core processors distributed over a local area network, all integrated onto a single microchip, and memory nowadays is akin to a remote file system distributed over a wide area network. High performance computing is all about streamlining data flow over physical networks and its networks all the way down unfortunately, there is a lot of magical thinking about computers these days. This slide is from one of our internal tech deep dives. The way people have been taught to think about hardware and behave when implementing software is detached from reality. I don't need to read fiction anymore, I just read the computer science literature. There's more magical thinking in CS today than there is in the most outlandish fantasy.
04:15:33.525 - 04:16:32.695, Speaker A: When the Fire Dancer effort started, much of my role was organizing various wish lists into a realistic development plan with measurable deliverables targeting practical computer computers. Let's look at some oversimplified wish lists. First, the foundation's top priorities were an independently developed second validator and fast operational recovery from faults, though Anza had not yet separated at the time, the second wish list I've characterized as theirs. They've been the most vocal with us about supporting a worldwide community with a 50 billion account capacity stretch goal. The next wish list I characterize as the operator communities, but it is universal. If one of our production systems goes down, the revenue it generates stops, but the associated costs continue like nothing happened. We care deeply that our systems stay up and the costs stay down.
04:16:32.695 - 04:17:22.895, Speaker A: This exact dynamic applies to the operator community. They care deeply, the chain stays up and their costs stay down. The last wishlist I've characterized as ours, but it is implied by the other wish lists. Consider a hypothetical protocol with 50 billion accounts. Suppose a protocol implementation used an off the shelf single threaded hashing library that could verify accounts at a seemingly fast 100,000 accounts per second at startup. Restarting the chain would take almost a week. So it looks like we need high speed parallel cryptography for high availability now consider now if that implementation had a 100 transactions per second capacity when operating on a handful of cores, just touching each account once would take over 15 years.
04:17:22.895 - 04:18:11.831, Speaker A: Looks like we need some high transact high speed transaction execution to get high scale. And compensating for this low execution capacity by just naively increasing your core count is prohibitively expensive. So it also looks like we need the high speed cores for efficiency. Now high speed is all about streamlining data flow and data flow is the first thing that is frozen in an architecture. If speed isn't considered upfront, the only way to significantly improve it later is to throw everything away away and start from scratch. One of the reasons for our interest in foundation is they groked this day one they were already the most performant chain and then by a wide margin. Our technical specialty is distributed computing at speeds people don't think is possible, much less worthwhile.
04:18:11.831 - 04:19:06.747, Speaker A: But contrary to conventional wisdom, this is not a weird affectation. As described at Breakpoint 22 exchange matching rules require us to make high performance distributed systems just to survive in ultra competitive financial markets. We've always thought our role is to push the protocol to the limits of physics and information theory, and we have been pleasantly surprised at how much of our performance expertise has been relevant to the availability, scalability and efficiency wishes. Now we turned these wish lists wish lists into a plan where we incrementally replaced agave components, documenting and optimizing along the way. There were three high level technical components corresponding to the data flow of a transaction through a validator when it is the leader. This data flow was very familiar. There's a lot of similarity between a trading system and a validator.
04:19:06.747 - 04:19:58.965, Speaker A: We already knew how to make a robust fast trading system from commodity and custom software, hardware and physical networks. We believed we could apply this experience to making a new validator. Our development plan was aligned with our development philosophy. Recall the computer science decision paralysis described at Breakpoint 22 and in subsequent talks and podcasts. When nothing is optimized, AMDL bottlenecks means there's no immediate payoff to anyone optimization. Also recall Amdel street justice when speed of light constraints meet power and heat constraints, dedicated compute in the right location is compute that can't be used for other calculations because it is either too far away or too specialized to do more than scratch the surface of what's possible. We must streamline data flow and then optimize everything along the path.
04:19:58.965 - 04:20:31.905, Speaker A: This led to the concept of a Franken dancer. As we replaced agave components, we would have an increasingly complete hybrid validator. We thought that this would have many practical benefits. Agave could continue to evolve independently. We would naturally keep in sync with protocol updates. The hybrid validator would be composed of documented and standardized modules that others could replace to make their own validators and not fully appreciated at the time. We would get community production and release exposed experience before the full Fire Dancer was ready.
04:20:31.905 - 04:21:10.469, Speaker A: That was the plan as of about two years ago. To our pleasant surprise, we did not need to deviate much from this plan. The main high level difference is we internally came to think of component 2 as a complete non voting validator and component 3 as a validator mature enough to participate in consensus. This is largely because components two and three were tightly coupled and worked on by the same people concurrently. Component one concerns performance and scale. It is easy to show benchmarks for these. Components two and three concern correctness and compatibility.
04:21:10.469 - 04:21:53.505, Speaker A: These don't have obvious benchmarks, so it is easy to underestimate their difficulty. Let's look at some of the challenges. One challenge was replicating implicitly specified behaviors. We reverse engineered and documented validator behaviors, including ones that weren't explicitly known but nevertheless required for consensus. These implicitly specified behaviors don't matter in a single client single version world, but need to be eliminated to make a multi client multiversion world possible. Further, since Fire Dancer is written in a different language than Agave Validator, developers can compare implementations. Rosetta Stone like to understand what is truly required for compatibility.
04:21:53.505 - 04:22:36.071, Speaker A: A second challenge was there was no way to tell who's right was an issue with Fire Dancer, Agave or the protocol. We open sourced an extensible test suite programmatically generated from tens of thousands of real and synthetic mainnet and testnet transactions. We also open sourced differential fuzzing harnesses. These go beyond the typical fuzzing frameworks which focus on detecting memory corruptions and invariant violations to establish a compatibility ground truth. Critically, these testing tools are validator agnostic. They don't care about the validator implementation details. A third challenge was replicating a complex runtime.
04:22:36.071 - 04:23:28.743, Speaker A: We requested simplifications to move toward a world where most runtime logic is on chain. We also provided feedback on proposed protocol changes with the goal of making the runtime a thin shell around a streamlined virtual machine. And yet another challenge was the protocol change proposals assumed a single validator world. We worked with Anza and foundation to improve SIMD's the protocol change process. Like compatibility testing, proposed improvements should be validator agnostic, I.e. they should be rigorously specified without reference to validator implementation details since we've open sourced all of this, developers who want to make their own validators or tune existing validators face much less complexity. They can benefit from our pathfinding, reverse engineering, testing, fuzzing documentation, security audits and so forth.
04:23:28.743 - 04:24:03.469, Speaker A: In short, it is very hard to go from one validator to two. It is much easier to go from two to many. Now with that understanding, let's get into a little more detail what we've done since Breakpoint 22. We announced the fire dancer effort mid August 22nd. At Breakpoint in early November we live demoed a signature verification deduplication block packing pipeline with a 1.2 million trend transactions per second ingress capacity and a 0.6 million signature verifications per second capacity on an old stock GCP host.
04:24:03.469 - 04:24:49.385, Speaker A: We also demoed A hardware accelerated SHA512 packet hashing pipeline with a roughly 100 gigabits per second capacity on an old stock AWS F1FPGA. This was the first stage of a hardware accelerated signature verification pipeline. At the time we thought it would take about two years to get to a new validator. Then in early January 23rd we live demoed that pipeline stitched into Agave, creating a proto Frankendancer. The protocol evolved to use QUIC for incoming transactions. We implemented and then live demoed our own high performance QUIC implementation integrated into the proto Frankendancer. We next live demoed the foundation and Anzar, a high performance turbine implementation integrated into the proto Frankendancer.
04:24:49.385 - 04:25:46.839, Speaker A: By this time hardware accelerated ED255 19 signature verification was functional and in late June we live demoed to anza and foundation a 1 million signature verifications per second at lower cost and lower power than CPUs or GPUs on the same old stock AWS F1 FPGA from before. We also demoed 8 FPGAs in a host to scale signature verification capacity to roughly 8 million signature verifications per second per host. Not too long after external partners started experimenting with Frankendancer. Frankendancer on Testnet was announced at Breakpoint 23 and we presented several related general innovations. This includes data parallelism techniques for elliptic curve cryptography. This reduced the core footprint required for the software signature verifications shown previously by roughly a factor of 2. Algorithmic and implementation improvements for Reed Solomon coding.
04:25:46.839 - 04:26:58.319, Speaker A: This sped up the block distribution calculations by roughly an order of magnitude and sandboxing to isolate validator internals for enhanced security without sacrificing performance. We were working on component 2 and 3 all this time and getting back to the grind after breakpoint we we did our first component 2 live demo faster than real time transaction replay to foundation in Anza in January 2024. Sprinkled throughout this we had technical off sites with validator developers at the Mountain Dao off site in Salt Lake City. We live demo transaction replay running on Asaga and Pixel phones. Then in early April we live demoed to Anzen foundation our Gossip protocol implementation, interoperating with testnet and mainnet and scaling to handle over 10 gigabits per second of incoming gossip to show componenton one's physical networking capacity. In early May we took Frankendancer to the Racetrack and live demoed to foundation and Anza. Roughly 100 modified Frankendancers running on commodity hosts distributed over a 25 gigabit per second data center local area network and a 100 gigabit per second intercontinental wide area network.
04:26:58.319 - 04:27:45.503, Speaker A: This demo required generating a massive load of simple uncontended transactions and participating in consensus required running these transactions through the Agave runtime. This demo showed a packet ingress and block distribution capacity over 1 million transactions per second. Shortly after, at the Chicago Technical off site we discussed the necessary protocol runtime and consensus modifications. We plan to do a lightweight version of this demo and discussion later today and again tomorrow. Given a well engineered physical network, the main bottlenecks at this point is the bandwidth to and from the accounts database. There's much room for improvement here across the entire technical stack. This was followed by yet another live demo to Anzen foundation.
04:27:45.503 - 04:28:48.165, Speaker A: We integrated components 1, 2 and 3 and showed a non voting proto fire dancer that is a full non voting full independent validator client running live on testnet and as an addendum to our next demo on mainnet. By this time Component two and three had come to fruition. Our next live demo to foundation and Anza was an alpha version of the full Fire Dancer voting on testnet. Around then we did a proof of concept port to Mac OS and FreeBSD for code linting and risk reduction. Started polishing the Frankendancers to incorporate feedback received from public external security audits and early testnet adopters. We also announced a Frankendancer audit contest and we've been pleased with the participation and feedback quality. Most recently we live demoed to anza and Foundation 10 gigabits per second block packing capacity for unique verified transactions in various scenarios Scenarios and we just announced a Franken Dancer bug bounty just like a validator needs to catch up from a snapshot at boot.
04:28:48.165 - 04:29:14.155, Speaker A: We've caught up with real time. I'm kind of proud this talk is recursive. It's like Charlie Kaufman made a PowerPoint the TLDR. We've been busy. Now is the point where if I could, I'd fast forward for the prep video spaceballs like to figure out what I'm supposed to do next. Many people suggest suggested I should give a proof of life. Though there are dates on the community bulletin board, this is probably not what they were talking about.
04:29:14.155 - 04:29:59.525, Speaker A: This is probably what they meant. This is a recent snapshot of software versions running on mainnet. Zooming in, we see a strange looking version number. The number on the right looks a little like an agave version. The other numbers seem to have something to do with Frankendancer, but as you've already figured out, yes, Frankendancer is live on Mainnet. But that's not the only proof of life we have for you. Here's another Fire Dancer is also live on testnet.
04:29:59.525 - 04:30:48.137, Speaker A: But we have a bunch of other proof of lives here. And this is a bit of an open secret for many reasons, least of which is that this is not our first talk this week. More importantly, we don't have the luxury of doing a Big Bang Greenfield rollout solo, as this proof of life suggests. We've been working with foundation and Anza to rollout Frankendancer and Fire Dancer to early adopters over the last few months and going slow to minimize risk. Notwithstanding some puzzled tweets we've seen about strange software version numbers and anomalously high throughput blocks, this seems to be working so far. Our goal is to keep future rollouts similarly uneventful. Most of my role lately has been low level coding, ranting and making slides.
04:30:48.137 - 04:31:50.345, Speaker A: My Most sufficient sophisticated GUIs historically have been ASCII art with colorful terminal text. But as the team has grown to include people with GUI and web skills, we have implemented RPC support for application developers, and a lot of work has gone into collecting and visualizing metrics to help operators manage and tune monitor running validators. Now, we didn't want to risk waiting for a random leader slot in the middle of this talk, so we recorded this proof of life earlier this week. This video shows a Frankendancer validator producing four mainnet blocks, and then shows features for monitoring the ecosystem real time. But note that Michael and Philip's hello World talk procured a fresh node from aws, checked out Fire Dancer from the public repo, built a validator from Scratch joined the newly valid built validator to testnet, fired up the GUI to remotely monitor it and showed it producing testnet blocks. And they did that all live. And at the end of this talk, time permitting, we will bring up a live view as well.
04:31:50.345 - 04:32:48.995, Speaker A: What does it all mean? First, we could use high performance networking to receive raw transactions requests at the limits of the physical network. We can use wide parallelism to get massive signature verification capacity and high performance computing to minimize how many many cores are required for that capacity. We could use high performance computing again to schedule verified transactions for execution as concurrent as possible with high throughput. We can use wide parallelism in high performance computing for a balanced transaction execution capacity with minimal cores. And we can use high performance networking to distribute blocks at the limits of the physical network. That is, we have shown that by streamlining data flow and optimizing everything along the path, a validator can hit its ecosystem's physical limits. Though widely available, commodity hardware can have over a 1 million transactions per second capacity.
04:32:48.995 - 04:33:46.707, Speaker A: The surrounding ecosystem needs work to expose it configurable protocol limits currently capacity below what is physically possible. We've talked with Anza and Foundation how to increase the limits safely and more generally generally to flesh out how feature gates and releases should work in a multi client world. The most expensive real world operations are finding data within and moving data between the account store and transaction execution cores. The cheapest real world operations are transactions compute units, but the transaction compute model currently overweights compute and underweights latency bandwidth and storage. This incentivizes applications to generate transactions that spike operator costs. Aligning the transaction compute model with real world limits could reduce hardware, physical network and time to boot requirements while preserving capacity. And for this work we analyzed many real world transactions at the bytecode level.
04:33:46.707 - 04:34:47.792, Speaker A: While compute units are cheap, we also see they are not used efficiently, often wasted an unnecessary framework over overheads not designed for a blockchain environment. Reducing these overheads can better utilize existing and future capacity while improving developer productivity. And this opportunity is completely independent of this validator work. Closely related, there are many opportunities to simplify the runtime and virtual machine to reduce implementation complexity and transaction execution hardware requirements. And we can use hardware like our wiredancer FPGA to increase signature verification capacity while freeing up cores for transaction execution and or reducing power and capacity is ultimately limited by the underlying physical network and network protocols. And there are a lot of opportunities here. A second independent validator has benefits beyond performance, but performance is a prerequisite for reduced cost and increased capacity as we are working with the community and we are working with the community in all these areas.
04:34:47.792 - 04:35:49.425, Speaker A: And as we've shown in demos, Agave can hit current protocol caps as is and it can go beyond when embedded in an uncapped high performance technology stack. So we believe Agave can be optimized comparably and that others will be able to apply the lessons we've learned to make additional performant validators and an efficient ecosystem. Now for this There's a lot of tightropes community members are walking here. Validator developers walk a tightrope between optimizing the protocol for a specific application and supporting many applications. If you are a validator developer, you've probably already heard from us plenty. Expect to hear more about improving the whole ecosystem, apply the lessons we've learned, use the test suites and fuzzing harnesses we use every day and keep evolving the protocol. Though we've been able to scale capacity to physical limits, keep in mind there are very real hard constraints on latency, bandwidth and power, all too often neglected in the magical thinking machine model of modern computer science.
04:35:49.425 - 04:36:54.467, Speaker A: These constraints are not unique to Frankendancer, Fire Dancer, the protocol, or anything else for that matter, but there's nothing fundamental we found that would prevent this community from streamlining the entire ecosystem. Validator operators walk a tightrope between minimizing cost for today's needs while providing capacity for tomorrow's. Because Frankendancer and Fire Dancer have a highly configurable scalable design, operators can adapt their hardware and network connectivity to community needs for the foreseeable future. Further, the tooling and monitoring we've open sourced can reveal physical network hardware and protocol bottlenecks for real world and extreme loads. So if you are a validator operator, work with foundation to try it out and expect to hear more from us about improving operational efficiency and robustness. Let us know how you want to balance the trade offs between cost and capacity now and going forward. Application developers walk a tightrope between optimizing applications to use today's capacity efficiently and implementing new functionality to get to market quickly.
04:36:54.467 - 04:37:35.033, Speaker A: Neither coding raw byte code in a hexagon editor nor running an unoptimized ray tracer on chain is viable, but orders of magnitude. Capacity is sitting on the table right now, independent of this work by optimizing applications for the same real world limits faced by the validator developer and operator. And as we've shown, there is plenty of additional capacity possible on top of that. So if you are an application developer, think big. Optimize your applications and give feedback on how to improve Improve the virtual machine runtime and programming model. Now, we view this project as the computer science equivalent of civil engineering. Like putting in a larger water main or widening a highway to support a growing community.
04:37:35.033 - 04:38:17.309, Speaker A: If this sounds boring, that's because infrastructure should be boring to the end user at least. I'm still surprised to be here on stage. We want the infrastructure to work, just work 24. 7 with room to enable classes of application applications not yet imagined or previously believed possible. Just as suddenly replacing a lightly used country road with a multi lane highway doesn't suddenly increase the amount of traffic, a sudden increase in application capacity doesn't suddenly increase the application load. And because we can't do a big bang rollout safely and other validators will need time to apply these lessons, end user improvements will happen over time. That is We've a long way, but we still have a long ways to go.
04:38:17.309 - 04:39:25.545, Speaker A: But all this really means is that we are still hard at work and committed to the community. In previous Breakpoint talks and early demos we showed this image of a sports car stuck in a traffic jam. This was a reminder that Amdel street justice meant we needed more than an optimized validator to have an impact. We needed to overcome the pervasive computer science decision paralysis and implementation Improve the whole ecosystem to realize the potential of modern computing technology. It's been about two years since then. How did we do in the last two years? We open sourced a tech stack for high performance distributed applications, rebased the existing validator on top of it, built a second independent validator on top of it, created custom hardware for further improvements, implemented tools for developer productivity and operator efficiency, wrote documentation and testing harnesses for future community development, and released many general technical innovations. By avoiding computer science magical thinking and designing for real world systems, we found orders of magnitude more capacity available in today's ecosystem and demonstrated how to optimize for another order of magnitude.
04:39:25.545 - 04:40:11.815, Speaker A: In our more recent demos we've ended with this image why we now believe Frankendancer was more than a stepping stone to Fire Dancer. It is a useful modular high performance platform for validator development. Agave can be made comparably performant, the rest of the ecosystem can evolve to expose validator capacity and the community can grow into this capacity. That is the traffic jam is starting to break up, the cars are starting to move and there's multiple sports cars on the road. But there are still potholes to watch out for and we continue to work to fill them. Before I Get off the stage. Thank you to the conference and its siblings for giving us the time to speak, and thank you to all the people for the work they have done over the last two years to bring Frankendancer and Fire Dancer to life.
04:40:11.815 - 04:40:46.415, Speaker A: With the time remaining, let's see if we can remotely monitor a running Frankendancer. So I think, okay, well, if we're willing to go over on time, we might get a leader slot here. But coming up here, we actually see the same monitor that was demonstrated at Block 0. This is running on Mainnet. Nothing's really happening right now because it's not a leader. There's a small trickle of transactions that are coming in. And as transactions move through the system, you will see when it becomes a leader generating the blocks and what happened to the transactions and where things might be getting stalled.
04:40:46.415 - 04:41:45.687, Speaker A: You'll see what the core utilizations are for the various components of the system as they go. And since I can't really control this from here, what you can also do with this is there's a number of options to see who's producing blocks, how long are they taking? Are they causing people to skip what the current transactions are doing and just general health of the chain? We have seen a lot of people already be very excited to get visibility into how the protocol is operating in the real world. And we think that this will be a pretty useful tool for everybody, I guess, with that. Yeah. Okay, well, if we're willing to go past. I don't really know what to do here while waiting for that to get a leader slot, but thank you. Thank you very much, Kevin, for that fast, fantastic presentation.
04:41:45.687 - 04:42:07.591, Speaker A: Standing room only. Honestly, what a feat of engineering. And I think the atmosphere in the room is absolutely electric, as you can tell. Maybe change of accent, change of backstage mc. My name is David. I'm one of the co founders of Drift, otherwise known as Cindy's co founder. For those familiar with the protocol, I'm delighted to be your host for the next two hours.
04:42:07.591 - 04:42:57.185, Speaker A: We have a series of very exciting keynotes happening, so please don't move from your seats. Stay tuned for more shortly. Next up, we have Mike Reed from Franklin Templeton with a product keynote on building a mutual fund on Solana. Please give a warm, warm round of applause to Mike. Hi, everyone. Thank you for having us here today. I'll say it's very bright up here, so the size of the crowd isn't quite as intimidating as it might be otherwise, but.
04:42:57.185 - 04:43:30.067, Speaker A: Hello, I'm Mike Reed. I run partnership development at Franklin Templeton Investments. And I'm going to talk to you today about putting a money fund on channel, what that looks like, why we did it, and why we thought it would be a good idea. As I was preparing for this, I realized that I think I have nine slides and now four and a half minutes to go through them. So I'm not going to go through this slide by slide. I thought it would be better to tell you about our journey and where we started and where we are now and why we're excited for the future. Our idea, no one cares about that.
04:43:30.067 - 04:44:08.875, Speaker A: Say hello to tokenization. Our idea was to, you know, try and find operational efficiencies in our overall business by using blockchain technology. And we thought that the idea of putting a money fund on chain, quite frankly, sounded kind of cool and sounded fun. So we began that process, you know, and we chose a money fund very specifically because money funds have long been in the transactional economy. There's money funds that have check writing and debit card capabilities built on top, top of them. And we thought if we wanted to try and use the blockchain efficiently, we wanted to have as many ledger entries as we possibly could. So we amped up transaction volume even further, not just having a money fund, but a daily paying money fund.
04:44:08.875 - 04:44:42.611, Speaker A: Rather than do this in kind of an inauthentic way by hiring an outside vendor to do the tokenization for us, we decided to build our own development team. So we hired a team of engineers who worked tirelessly to build a digital wallet infrastructure, build an on chain transfer agent, and then we did it. We launched a money fund, we put it on blockchain rails and we were super excited. And it turned out no one else was because our money fund at the time was yielding right around 0%. So no one cared. But we were high fiving. We thought it was this great technological invention.
04:44:42.611 - 04:45:20.327, Speaker A: You know, we were super excited about it. And then an interesting thing started to happen. Interest rates started creeping up slowly and then people started to take note and they were interested. And then all of a sudden some of the small regional banks started experiencing some volatility. And then we got reverse inquiry and people started calling us and asking us, hey, can we put our treasury with you? Can I put my dry powder with you? And we started getting inflows from a variety of people who were in the ecosystems that we were working on. People like, you know, VC funds that invested in blockchain native business, web, three businesses that had Treasuries and they started parking assets with us. And then we started raising money in a product.
04:45:20.327 - 04:46:05.065, Speaker A: Quite frankly, we never really intended to raise money in, and we were really excited about that too. But what made us more excited was when we started thinking about this product less like a product and more like a financial services tool. So I'll give you an example of that. The VC client who I mentioned earlier, he called up and he said, hey, can I transfer this to other people? Can I use this and send it to my portfolio companies to fund them that way? Because usually what happens is I have my money in this money fund, I have to sell it, transfer it over, and then I hope that my portfolio company invests in something responsible like a money fund. And that whole process is 3 ish days of cash drag. And we said, yeah, we can code that up for you. So we started building that into the system and all of a sudden we had transferability where users of our product could send it amongst themselves as a fine.
04:46:05.065 - 04:46:30.051, Speaker A: Then we had another client come up and he said, you know, I really like this, this product. It's great. I would love to be able to onboard natively with a digital asset. I would love to use USDC to be able to make Benji purchases. And we said, we can code that up too. And so we did, and we built a really exciting tool that could be moved around all of a sudden across all these different blockchain ecosystems. Now, the reason we're here today, this is kind of a timeline of everything I just talked about.
04:46:30.051 - 04:46:56.203, Speaker A: I think the stories are better than this. If you like this, feel free to, I don't know, take a picture or whatever. But the reason I'm here today and the thing that we're really excited about talking about here at Breakpoint is the 13th step, which is where we filed to develop on Solana natively. Now, again, we don't use third parties. We mint authentically on chain. We do not have an off chain book of records that we maintain. The record of ownership is the token itself.
04:46:56.203 - 04:47:33.195, Speaker A: You own that token in your wallet and that's your authentic record of ownership. Why do we like Solana? Why do we choose Solana? We have a tech suitability framework that we use when we're evaluating all of the different blockchains that we develop on. We also, quite frankly, have a business development one where we look at the community and see how excited the community is about using the chain. So many of the reasons that you all are passionate about Solana are the reasons that we're passionate about Solana as well. I'd encourage you, by the way, this isn't in any of the content, but I'd encourage you to look at our Twitter account. It's ftida authentically. That is written by our team, our digital asset team, our research analyst develop content.
04:47:33.195 - 04:47:57.941, Speaker A: There's actually an interesting piece on Solana on that, but in my last 10 seconds I'll point out the things that we like about Solana. Speed. We want to be able to move money around very, very quickly. Cost. The cost efficiency of efficiencies of running this system on chain are a benefit to both us as a firm and to you as an end user. Modern architecture. The standards used on Solana are extremely important to us and we're working on developing standards that we believe should be used across the industry.
04:47:57.941 - 04:48:37.535, Speaker A: And lastly, the Solana team has been absolutely fantastic to work with and their development tools are second to none. So I'd like to thank you all for having me here today for my 5 minute pitch. Enjoy the rest of Breakpoint and I'll see you all around. Thank you very much, Mike. Next up, we have yet another institutional institutional speaker, Mark Attard, presenting for Citi's strategic focus on digital assets. Welcome. Hey.
04:48:37.535 - 04:49:40.635, Speaker A: Hey everyone. I'm Mark Atad. I'm the head of Digital assets and client engagement for TTs at Citi and I'm so thrilled and proud to be here in front of you all to talk about what we've got coming up at Citi. So Citi from a digital assets and blockchain perspective has been working within this area for a number of years now. And what we've realized is that, you know, this technology is the future and part of the future in financial infrastructure. And so what I want to do today is show you or give you a sneak preview into how we think about digital assets, how we think about blockchain, but also bringing all that architecture together to offer the future of finance change the way in which we in trade fi look at things and hopefully enter the world of Defi too eventually. So can we run the video? Digital innovation is shaping the future of finance and blockchain has emerged as a key enabler to unlock industry transformation.
04:49:40.635 - 04:51:05.671, Speaker A: Citi is partnering with clients on the future of digital money and securities. Working towards an increasingly digital economy and an always on financial system, the Citi Digital Assets teams are charting a path to build and launch blockchain based solutions, unlocking efficiencies and new capabilities. Let's look at Citi's solution. Introducing Citi Integrated Digital Asset Platform cdap which enables innovative digital asset solutions through a Single integrated platform using the power of blockchain. The platform consists of a single portal, a cohesive set of API and microservices to manage an internal blockchain network for token issuance and usage, with custody capabilities for traditional assets issued or settled on an external blockchain network. Yeah, so from our perspective, what we really wanted to do was bring together the technology, but from our point of view as well is we needed to start somewhere, we needed to start internally, and we wanted to do this in a way that we could grow the community, look at how we can structure this from an ecosystem perspective and move forward as well as, and when the regulation change and becomes more abundant from our perspective. And so CDAP is our technology stack that brings all of that together and that's the Citi Integrated Digital Assets platform.
04:51:05.671 - 04:51:57.167, Speaker A: And we've launched our first product, which is Citi Token Services for Cash. And that really is the ability for our clients to connect to our infrastructure, but also to leverage blockchain, to leverage the power of blockchain to be able to do 24 by 7 money transfers across our branch network. And what that really does is solve a number of key friction points for our clients today. And hopefully in the future we'll be able to connect that to a multibank capability and bring that beyond that so that we can go beyond the borders of Citi and start really looking at how we can connect the world going forward as well. Also on the other front, we are looking at asset tokenization as well. My previous person on Franklin Templeton is showing us the way on which they are doing asset tokenization. But we see this as part of the fundamental journey which is to start with the flow of cash.
04:51:57.167 - 04:52:50.687, Speaker A: Because from that perspective, everything starts from a cash point of view. We always have cash as a part of a transaction, as a part of a good, as a part of a service. And so we really need that as part of that infrastructure to be able to move forward and to be able to launch that from our perspective and to partner there to achieve some of the things that we all talk about in blockchain. And that's really around atomic settlement from a delivery versus payment point of view as well. And so I'm really excited to announce also that CDAP enables us to be able to look at how we integrate into other blocks blockchain as well, and how we can create that interoperability from that perspective. And so we've been deeply researching into Solana and looking at the infrastructure that they have, the technology that they have, and the ecosystem that Solana has created. And obviously a lot of you out here are members of that ecosystem and are powered by Solana.
04:52:50.687 - 04:53:36.177, Speaker A: So from a city perspective, we want to join the industry as well. We want to explore opportunities with Solana and see where the future takes us. Because ultimately what we want to do is make sure that connectivity is not just simply a word, interoperability is not simply a word, but we actually stand for that and we use the power of that to be able to connect across that. And so in the coming months, we'll look at various opportunities to leverage Solana and potentially some of those capabilities across smart contracts and programmers and see the opportunities that we have to connect with Solana from that perspective. And So I have 30 seconds left before they pull me off. We'll hook and take my microphone off. So I want to thank everyone, thank Solana for the opportunity to speak.
04:53:36.177 - 04:54:06.935, Speaker A: But I'm looking more broadly at the opportunities of the future and the way that we can partner and go forward and bring this community and ecosystem together. So thank you very much for your time. Fantastic. Thank you so much for that mark. Up next, a favorite of mine, introducing Wormhole. They are giving a presentation on Securitize and Wormhole presented by Carlos and Robinson respectively. Please welcome them to the stage.
04:54:06.935 - 04:54:32.345, Speaker A: Good afternoon everybody. Good afternoon. You start. My name is Robinson. I'm the co founder of the Wormhole Foundation. I'm Carlos Domingo. I'm the co founder and CEO of Securitize.
04:54:32.345 - 04:55:05.445, Speaker A: All right, so my company Securitize is the leading tokenization platform. We started in 2018. We're going to be seven years actually November 2017. We're going to be seven Years old in November this year. And we're known for having tokenized a lot of the leading asset managers like KKR, Hamilton Lane and more recently BlackRock. We've done probably at this point over a billion dollars of tokenized assets on chain over the last few years. And we have more than half a million investors that have been onboarded through our platform.
04:55:05.445 - 04:55:43.735, Speaker A: And Wormhole is the leading interoperability platform. Wormhole has been around for about four years now. We actually got our start with Solana and Solana and Ethereum. We processed over 47 billion in asset transfer across chains. We've done over 1 billion messages as well. We've helped secure 4,000 unique assets moving cross chains and 150 applications on chain today using some version of wormholes tech. And we're also why we're all here is Solana one of the leading blockchains as well with significant tvl, TPS validators and total transaction numbers.
04:55:43.735 - 04:56:18.621, Speaker A: Good. So you might be wondering what is Securitize doing here on the stage with Wormhole at the Solana conference? Right. So we're here to give you a small announcement about collaboration that we're going to be starting more forward. The first thing is security guys has, you know, decided to adopt the Wormhole solution for the, you know, scalability and cross chain interoperability of all the blockchains that we support. We need to natively support each blockchain that we work with because we need to issue assets that are represent securities. So this is something that we have to have a direct integration with them. We've integrated with many of the leading EVM platforms.
04:56:18.621 - 04:57:28.575, Speaker A: But the second announcement that we're doing today is that moving forward we're going to be starting integrating with Solana to support Solana to be able to deploy all the tokenized assets that we have in our platform over the time into the Solana platform and also use Wormhole to move them across other chains. The institutions are here and one of the biggest demands is to come to Solana and so Wormhole is helping that, helping Securitize here with this and bringing all of the fund managers that Securitize works with on chain to Solana. And how is it working? So securitize multichain assets, it's a unified multi chain user experience, meaning that the tokens maintain their unique properties. So it's an SPL or an ERC 20 obviously depending on which chain it's on, there's no need for liquidity pools. So for those of you who have been sending assets across chains for years or many months now, you're for familiar with some of the challenges you'll run into. You no longer need liquidity bridges or to compose unique transactions to ultimately just go from a native asset to native asset. Today you're just able to send, maintain that fungibility and send between all these different blockchains.
04:57:28.575 - 04:58:11.151, Speaker A: There's institutional compliance with this solution. So Securitize will maintain ownership of these contracts and they can change anything they need in order to maintain maintain any sort of compliance regulations they need to. And then there's a multichain synchronized token state. So with the Guardian network we're able to maintain this synchronized state or global synchronized state so that you can maintain the integrity of the token balance across all different chains. Unified liquidity for securitized tokens assets across all of defi. So this is just an example of the Simplified front end of what it will look like and you'll be able to send to any chain. Most importantly, Solana, we have not done yet an asset that is multichain.
04:58:11.151 - 04:58:46.435, Speaker A: All the assets that we've done so far are single issue in one chain because of the complexity of maintaining, you know, the integrity of the asset across multiple blockchains. Because these assets represent securities and they have a lot of different type of restrictions we need to apply with the smart contract. So moving forward, thanks to the work home solution, we'll be able to implement this. All right, so I think to end here for the last 30 seconds, we have, we have a small video to play for you guys. Thanks for your time. Billions of dollars flow through the global economy daily. As the world changes, so must the systems that move its value forward.
04:58:46.435 - 04:59:17.045, Speaker A: Treasury bonds have long been a bedrock of traditional finance. But a new era is emerging. The era of tokenized assets. Tokenization is breathing new life into traditional assets. Liquidity, once out of reach, is now within grasp. Real time settlement and 24, seven markets once imagined are now reality. This is just the dawn of a more connected, accessible and open future.
04:59:17.045 - 05:00:17.215, Speaker A: To lead this future securitize, the leading tokenization platform has chosen wormhole to securely and seamlessly scale tokenized assets globally. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. Carlos and Robinson, very excited for the partnership. Next up we have Guillaume from Societal General. Hope my French is good on bridging the gap between capital markets and digital assets. Hi everyone, thanks for having me here. A little bit of word about my myself before I talk about the cool products that we're doing at Societe General Forge.
05:00:17.215 - 05:01:13.325, Speaker A: So I've been studying capital markets long time ago, spent more than 10 years at JP Morgan. My last role was head of equities and equity derivatives for the private bank in Asia Pacific. 2017 I left the bank, decided to become an entrepreneur in the blockchain space and did the first ever structured product to clear settle because studies on the public blockchain basically doing Rwanda before RWA was even award it was way too early. So I switched, went to Coinbase, spent three years as head of institutional sales for Asia Pacific and Emea. And six months ago I decided it was time to come back to the banking world, come back into RWA and put like all my energy into growing that business. So I joined SGforge which is a subsidiary of Societe General, one of the largest systemic banks in Europe which is also 160 year old. Basically making me a suit and a dinosaur.
05:01:13.325 - 05:02:08.109, Speaker A: All right, it's not Working. So what we're doing at Societe General Forge, we're a fully owned subsidiary of Societe General and we're dedicated to digital assets. We've been tokenizing securities since 2020. And the first big achievement that we had was to be the lead of the syndicate for the tokenization of the European Investment bank bond, which was a hundred million euro bond. Other persons in the syndicates were Goldman Sachs and a large bank in Spain. Since then we've been tokenizing more bonds, more structured products, which is one of the core, core business of our investment bank. And if you fast forward until the beginning of this year, we decided to push the envelope even further and essentially tokenize the investment leg.
05:02:08.109 - 05:03:17.699, Speaker A: Instead of investing into this tokenized product with cash, we wanted to offer a settlement instrument in order to do so more automatically and more efficiently. So we launched a Stablecoin that is called Euro CV and that we use for the investment into the bond that we issued at the beginning of this year, which was a green bond issued by the bank and sold to a big insurer in France. Talking about the Stablecoin, this Stablecoin is the first MICA compliant stablecoin that is issued by a bank. We as we received the EMI license in Europe, we also decided that we wanted to make it permissionless and fully transferable. So there are like three different use cases for this stablecoin and we're working on these three verticals at the same time. The first one I mentioned, like using it as a settlement instrument for all the products that we and other manager, asset managers and other banks are bringing on chain. It's a settlement instrument but also can be used as a lifecycle management instrument.
05:03:17.699 - 05:04:26.431, Speaker A: Imagine paying your coupons directly with a stablecoin and at maturity of the product automatically repaying the notional plus accrued payments to the investors automatically. The second use case is working with corporates, corporates and their treasury desk in order for them to transfer value 24, 7 cross border instantaneously and very cheaply. We're also working with them using programmatic money in a way for them to be able to basically better manage their liquidity intraday. And finally, the very interesting use case, and there's the reason why we're here, is making the stablecoin available in the crypto world as an on and off ramp for people who want to have like an investment grade stablecoin to enter into that ecosystem, but also to make it available in the defi space liquidity pools. Being able to use it in lending and also being able to Use it in Dexes. And that's the reason why I'm here as well. Today we really believe that the future is multichain and we have been very careful in choosing which next chain to use for the deployment of that Stablecoin.
05:04:26.431 - 05:04:51.825, Speaker A: And obviously it has been Solana. A few reasons for that. Obviously, from a technical point of view, low latency, very high throughput and very low cost was something that is very important to us. But it's also like the ecosystem to me. The ecosystem is growing very fast. We see more and more developers coming to this chain. And we also had like amazing discussions with the people at the foundation.
05:04:51.825 - 05:05:42.441, Speaker A: It was really a pleasure to work with them and very, very efficient as well. Having said that, we're not planning to just stay on stablecoin and bring only stablecoin to Solana. We have been tokenizing more securities. They are here on the slide talking about Smart Cash, which is a structured product which has a payout that is very similar to Money Market Fund structured products, which are investment solutions consisting of bonds and derivatives packaged together. That's really investment solutions that we would plan to bring as well if there are good use cases and finally bonds. To me, the importance of blockchain technology and financial markets, the two are going to converge in one place, which I believe is going to be defi. I think Solana is the perfect ecosystem for that.
05:05:42.441 - 05:06:15.625, Speaker A: And hopefully there's going to be a lot of builders who are going to help us do what we're trying to achieve. So just a call for action here, please. We're not trying to build everything ourselves. We would like to have like all the builders come to us, present what they're trying to do and see if we can do something together. My email is here and thank you very much for giving me the time. Fantastic. Thank you, Guillaume.
05:06:15.625 - 05:07:00.807, Speaker A: Next up, we have a product that we all probably use. Presenting Fan presenting for Phantom. Donny Ding. How's it going everybody? My name is Donnie Dinch. I look after special projects at Phantom. And since we joined with the acquisition of our company earlier this year, we've been quite busy. For a lot of you that have used Phantom, you may have seen some of these features.
05:07:00.807 - 05:07:33.405, Speaker A: We've launched things like liquid staking with jd. We've added an improved token page experience. We spent a lot of energy on making a lot of real time improvements in the space as well for the product. But the most recent thing that we're excited about is the launch of Phantom accounts and usernames. And so some of you may have been able to claim your username this year or this week rather. And we're very excited because that introduces a novel key based off authentication method that is docs free. So excited about that.
05:07:33.405 - 05:08:06.775, Speaker A: A couple stats. 2024 has been pretty good. We have roughly 7 million monthly active users. Since the beginning of the year, we've done nearly $9 billion in swapper volume inside the product. And that's happened with about half a billion different transactions. So we're quite excited to be the first Solana Wallet to really come in and build a great experience. But I think we've done a really good job of maintaining that positioning right now.
05:08:06.775 - 05:08:44.425, Speaker A: That said, I think there's still a lot of work to do with wallets. This was a tweet that we saw recently that really stuck out to me because I think one thing that's very core to this mission of getting millions and millions, millions and billions of people in crypto is that the wallet construct still has a lot of work left. We're not quite there yet. And so what we've built today has been incredible. It's been an incredible tool to support the market as it exists today. But I think we're all excited about the broad implications of getting hundreds of millions of people on blockchain. And so the way that we really think about this situation is that the job isn't quite finished.
05:08:44.425 - 05:09:29.753, Speaker A: Again, the tool that we build is great, but I don't know that it's for everyone just yet. And so what we're really excited to share today is a new thing that we've been working on. So a quick look at the wallet landscape as it looks today. We have an immense amount of respect and appreciation for all the products that have been shipped to help people on board. But I think if you ask the broad, let's say global audience, when we talk 5,600 million different people, this is kind of where we see a lot of the wallet experiences falling today. Either it's a full wallet experience and with that comes a lot of difficulty in using it, or it's a little bit of a less of a wallet experience. But it's kind of easier with the embedded wallets that we've seen to date.
05:09:29.753 - 05:10:20.575, Speaker A: And so we see a pretty large opportunity to find ourselves building a full wallet experience that's actually very, very easy to use. So today, very excited to announce Phantom Embedded Wallets as the latest product that we've been working on. So this is, I'm going to walk through it a little bit here. This is the sign in experience As a product designer in my, I guess, previous life I was really big on innovate or die, almost had it tattooed on my arm. But at this point in life I think innovate as a last resort kind of makes a little bit more sense. And in this situation we don't think that we need to innovate on the way that people log in and access things. And so supporting the traditional single sign on methods like Google, Apple or email make a lot of sense to us.
05:10:20.575 - 05:11:15.875, Speaker A: And then the way that we see this wallet being powered, obviously it's a seedless wallet, so you don't have to worry about a seed phrase. But something that we've done that's quite unique is it's built on an open protocol and what that allows us to do is have all the key shares in supported in a distributed manner. And so we actually work with a company, a tool set called Juicebox, that whenever you create that PIN that you just saw, that actually creates PIN shares. And those PIN shares aren't all stored by Phantom, they're stored in different realms. So at launch we'll have a realm that Phantom owns. We're working with a partner, Triton, that will also have a realm and we'll be working to add subsequent realms as we go. And we think this makes everything quite brute force proof and really, really helps to take Phantom out of any sort of situation in which we would be a single point of failure on anything to do with your PIN being recovered.
05:11:15.875 - 05:12:01.315, Speaker A: So to walk through the UI a little bit, like all embedded wallets and wallets in general, you need to be able to sign transactions, you should be able to communicate that. The good news is we spent a couple years building a great wallet experience that we were able to tailor and bring into this embedded wallet and things like simulation, things like just making it feel like a tighter feedback loop so users understand exactly what's happening. But I think this is, this is actually where a lot of embedded wallets kind of end for the most part. And we wanted to take it a bit further. And so the Phantom embedded wallet will have an entire UX experience. It is a full wallet experience on the inside. And we think that helps users understand exactly what it is that they need to do.
05:12:01.315 - 05:12:42.195, Speaker A: What's happening and then what are the, what are the tighter feedback loops of what just happened when they signed a transaction? So in addition to having viewing inventory, we also have a live feed of the activity that's happening. We include that pending data. The onus to build this has generally been on Dapps and we wanted to take that away from them and help make it easier for them to integrate these wallets into their products. The other cool thing is we're adding the swapper into the embedded wallet. So now any DApp that's building any product can drop a swapper in immediately whenever they add the phantom wallet. Phantom embedded wallet. And we're quite excited about that.
05:12:42.195 - 05:13:33.135, Speaker A: The other cool thing is when you logged in, you can use, you know, Google, Apple, email, whatever. Generally when you've used embedded wallets, you get into a place where it's very siloed. I can only access it in this product or I can only access it in this product. And I was like, is it the same wallet? I have no idea. Well, with this, with phantom embedded wallet and the recent release of phantom accounts, you'll be able to access those wallets that you create anywhere in addition to the phantom clients that exist today. So logging into the mobile wallet, logging into the browser extension, logging into the embedded wallet, it's all one ecosystem system now that is all surrounded by this canonical phantom account. So we're quite excited about that.
05:13:33.135 - 05:14:26.341, Speaker A: Anyway, we put together a little video. I hope it's not too loud. I'm going to play and then see what everyone thinks. I'll do. Incredible team. Okay, so to quickly summarize the big announcement this week we're announcing an embedded wallet. It's going to have a full wallet ui.
05:14:26.341 - 05:15:03.005, Speaker A: It's going to be, it's going to support phantom accounts. And we also wanted to really point out to the fact that it's going to be competitively priced. And so by competitive we mean free. And so not only is the Phantom Embedded Wallet a free product, we also see a future quite soon in which dapps that add Phantom Embedded Wallet will be to monetize that. And so we're excited to and fortunate to work with a group of launch partners when this product comes to market later this fall. And that is the Phantom embedded wallet. If you want early access, scan this QR code or go to boo.phantom.com
05:15:03.005 - 05:15:44.101, Speaker A: and that's all. Thank you. Thank you, Donnie. Next up, we have arguably one of the biggest players in the Salon ecosystem. Introducing Jeremy Allaire from Circle. Hello, good afternoon. It's awesome to be here.
05:15:44.101 - 05:16:22.955, Speaker A: I'm going to talk a little bit about the state of the USDC economy, which is strong and it's very strong in the Solana ecosystem. Super excited to be here with the community. USDC has scaled enormously in the past six years since we lost launched it, since we launched back in 2018, we've seen over $16.2 trillion of transactions happening. And that number is accelerating. And it's accelerating in a significant part because of the incredible adoption on the Solana ecosystem at a high level. We're scaling on a bunch of fronts.
05:16:22.955 - 05:17:33.265, Speaker A: First, we're scaling in terms of the infrastructure that USDC runs on, on 15 chains and connecting those chains together in a seamless way through CCTP, which has already done about $13 billion of volume. As you know, USDC is available as a protocol as a digital currency all around the world and has grown significantly in the past 12 months. USDC in the Solana ecosystem is doing phenomenally well. If you look at that cumulative volume from 2023 to 2024 in 2023, cumulative volume of about $600 billion in USDC transactions in 2024. So far, already doing nearly $8 trillion in on chain transactions in the Solana ecosystem, which is astounding. Obviously available in all the places that you can connect to the blockchain. And just the sheer number of transactions that are happening through all of the different projects and protocols that are using this today has grown quite significantly as well.
05:17:33.265 - 05:18:31.505, Speaker A: I want to just touch for a minute on cctp. CCTP has been a huge innovation in enabling cross chain liquidity, enabling people who are coming on chain through one ecosystem to move seamlessly across those ecosystems. And that's been a huge success. And I know a lot of developers here depend upon some of the other projects that have integrated this in seamless ways on Solana and we're seeing more and more adoption, but that growth has been incredible. If you look at the numbers today, about 85%, almost 85% of USDC that moves between chains is now moving over cctp. And what that means is that these digital dollars can move safely, efficiently, securely, without any capital inefficiency and with the greatest security possible. Because of what we've been able to build, we're doing more with this.
05:18:31.505 - 05:20:01.929, Speaker A: We're going to have new versions of this coming out which developers will be able to take advantage of and that ultimately are going to enable USDC to move extremely fast across all these different ecosystems again. So if you're building applications that need digital dollars and users are coming from different ecosystems, you'll be able to do it whether it's a payment application where someone might be using a Coinbase wallet, using Base, and paying someone on a Solana wallet that is using USDC to enable that abstraction so that users don't have to know exactly what's happening underneath and the other applications that are coming, like cross chain margining, cross chain defi, other things like that are going to be increasingly made possible using innovations that we're introducing in CCTP itself. I want to touch on an update on how to think about the safety and transparency, transparency and liquidity of USDC as well. We've invested massively over the last year to continue to improve the fundamental security and liquidity of usdc. On the left is a snapshot of the balance sheet of usdc. And what's really critical about this is that today you can see there's a piece of this that is in cash. That cash is almost entirely held in several global systemically important banks, banks that are too big to fail and that have the effective backstop of the government.
05:20:01.929 - 05:20:59.495, Speaker A: So the effect of the safest forms of commercial bank cash that you can hold and the remainder is in what is called the Circle Reserve Fund that is issued by BlackRock. It is an SEC registered and supervised structure that is available to Circle where we hold around 90% of the of the USDC reserves and those are held exclusively in Treasuries and Treasury Repos. And what's powerful about this is that if you go on the Internet and you search usdxx, you can actually go and look inside the Circle Reserve and see every single instrument, every single T bill, every single all of the dates and liquidity. And so you have the most transparent digital dollar in the world. And we believe through this level of transparency we're building one of the most transparent financial institutions in the world. We don't just take our word for it. A lot of companies in this industry say they can't get big four auditors.
05:20:59.495 - 05:21:55.365, Speaker A: Big four auditors won't audit companies in this industry. That is just wrong. Deloitte and Touche is our auditor and at a corporate level and provides assurance as to the these reserves on a consistent basis. When we think about what we're building, so that's the state of the USDC asset and so you can feel comfortable building on this. But as a company, we think about what we're building as building a general purpose platform and network utility. It is a utility that allows any person, any developer, any application to use digital dollars anywhere in the world. And that network and that network utility is based on at the core, the infrastructure that we provide in our platform, the open source infrastructure, our public protocols, cctp, new public protocols that we're going to be launching.
05:21:55.365 - 05:22:31.715, Speaker A: Also all of the actual financial infrastructure we provide to ensure that we have the Liquidity and availability in banking systems all around the world. Today, USDC can be created and redeemed natively directly in the US banking system 24. 7 in the European banking system, almost also 24. 7 in the Singapore banking system, the Hong Kong banking system. And just this week we announced availability of direct liquidity in the Brazilian banking system with 24.7integration and in Mexico as well. We are exposed expanding this liquidity network around the world.
05:22:31.715 - 05:23:27.245, Speaker A: So that's at the core this platform that we have. But today we're just incredibly grateful to the thousands of companies that build products and services on top of this consumer facing, business facing, market facing. And so this partner ecosystem which continues to grow and is thriving is building value together with us. It's building value that then faces users and institutions all around the world and that in turn builds a network that delivers utility that reinforces itself this platform utility. The more people, the more institutions, the more developers that build on this, the more valuable this becomes for all of us because it creates more and more utility that we can tap into. So we have a lot we're building in this front which we'll be excited to share as we go forward. Everyone talks about stablecoins and stablecoin use cases.
05:23:27.245 - 05:24:21.635, Speaker A: It's been amazing to see and a lot of the exciting projects are emerging also in the Solana ecosystem. As we just heard. The Biddle Fund is a great example of that. That enables USDC interoperability with a traditional asset. That's like the capital markets use case with BlackRock and securitize. But moving from a world where, you know, stablecoins were really originally built in this digital asset trading space into a world where they're being used in consumer payments, they're being used in traditional capital markets that are coming on chain and they're being increasingly used on a global basis to move value for households, for corporations. It's incredible being here in Asia, just talking to the number of people who are working with companies that are moving value between companies using stablecoins as really a next generation model for how value moves in the world.
05:24:21.635 - 05:24:57.785, Speaker A: Now there's a lot of use cases that are expanding. One of the things that we're excited about is the infrastructure improvements that are actually happening in the Solana ecosystem. And I'm really excited actually to be able to bring up Lucas from Jito and talk about a major launch that we're excited about that's happening involving USDC and the restaking liquid restaking ecosystem. So please welcome Lucas from Gino. All right, how you doing good? Awesome. See all those numbers and the charts going. We like the direction.
05:24:57.785 - 05:25:30.275, Speaker A: So yeah, today we're excited to announce that Renzo will be launching easy USDC using JITA restaking. Super excited. I think USDC is a great asset. We're going to see a lot of stablecoin adoption in restaking. You don't really have to worry about the security dropping and volatility in the asset and so super excited to see that and all the networks that are going to launch and use ustc. It's awesome. Congratulations.
05:25:30.275 - 05:26:48.263, Speaker A: All right, so this is super cool, right? USDC can be a liquid restaking asset and that can help secure all of these new networks that are launching and building up on the Solana ecosystem. So it's a huge step forward in the utility of USDC in the core security of how this broader ecosystem is going to be built. As we think about the future of the Internet financial system, we have a traditional legacy financial system but we're all together building this future Internet financial system and it's being built on chain and I've met with a number of lots and lots of projects that are here today that are doing pieces of this today. They're building on chain payments, they're building on chain FX using multiple stablecoins projects like Squads and others building on chain treasury management on chain credit I believe is also going to be a critical piece of what takes place where actual credit intermediation moves to happen entirely underwritten through pools on chain. And over time we expect, you know, corporations as a whole to move more and more of all of the facets of what they do. Not just in finance, but in commerce and in governance. We have a long term vision to see all of this built out.
05:26:48.263 - 05:28:03.645, Speaker A: But I want to drill in on one thing here that we're super excited about which is on chain AI agents today. If you think about the Internet, it's fundamentally being rewired with progress in AI. We're all using that and seeing that constantly, but there's tons of friction that exists. Over 80% of the web's content is behind paywalls and most apps that that you want to interact with require you to register and use them. We believe we're going to see and we're beginning to see a rewiring of that in a world where blockchain networks and AI can connect and unlock use of all this knowledge, use of all this information and facilitating more and more seamless transactions behind the scenes, doing work for you and doing work amongst those AI agents themselves. So what if we could do a world where AIs can programmatically interact with micropayments down to the scent? What kind of blockchain could support that today? Come on, Solana. All right, so we're envisioning and working towards with our programmable wallets infrastructure, SDKs and other things that are going to enable a better way to search and pay for information.
05:28:03.645 - 05:28:43.909, Speaker A: I want to know what the future of electric cars is. I want to enable my AI agent to be able to make microtransactions across these paid content sources to give me the best information possible. I want a faster, easier way to book a trip to Singapore. I want to tell it what I want and then I want it to be able to go out and give me the answers for what's possible. And I want to be able to have those AIs doing work on my behalf and paying pennies for the basic work and the basic tasks that they're doing. I want to build an app. I want to ask an AI to produce something for me.
05:28:43.909 - 05:30:09.347, Speaker A: I want to give it a prompt, I want it to come back and use repl it to actually generate that app in seconds. And I want to compensate that AI agent for producing that specific interactive utility that I need to conduct my work. This is all possible to do today and you're going to see more and more from Circle in this area as we pursue a world of AI agents that are interacting and mediating commerce, transactions, finance and other things on the Internet. Programmable wallets, which are available on Solana, gives the wallet infrastructure that's necessary for websites to be able to handle transactions in stablecoins and put those, put those behind APIs that AI agents can consume, the infrastructure, that software that's spun up by AI agents to make those transactions happen. And then obviously USDC itself as this critical infrastructure and critically, critically, the velocity of transactions, the scale of transactions and the cost efficiency of those transactions has to happen on high throughput, highly scalable, highly cost efficient Internet infrastructure. And that's exactly what Solana is doing. Obviously there's other ecosystems that are trying to address this problem, but we're obviously very, very impressed in what we've seen from and heard from with Fire Dancer is extraordinary.
05:30:09.347 - 05:31:05.901, Speaker A: We envision a world where there are the explosion in transaction velocity that happens when the cost of moving value is effectively zero. And the explosion of software and interaction that's going to take place through mediation with AI agents is extraordinary. And that's coming into focus even in the next year. The proliferation of agentic applications is coming in a meaningful way and we need this kind of infrastructure together to do this. So USDC has done incredibly well in the last six years. Solana is a huge part of its success and I'm grateful to everyone here that works with USDC and builds out this network and creates more utility for all of us. And I'm incredibly excited about more partnerships in this ecosystem and seeing what becomes possible when this extraordinary infrastructure combines with the kind of infrastructure Circle's building to build a very different future for the Internet.
05:31:05.901 - 05:31:37.739, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you very much for that, Jeremy. Well, I've been the voice of God in the background for a while, so I figured it'd be time to show my face for the first time. Hello everyone. My name is David. I'm from Drift. As I said earlier for the audience members who may not have heard, people sometimes ask, are you Cindy's co founder? And that I am.
05:31:37.739 - 05:32:14.665, Speaker A: I want to share a quick announcement before I announce the break. Big news for Drift. But before I drop this news, I want to sort of fast backtrack four years. The first break point was when we announced our V1. We launched our V1 product onto mainnet in 2021 and then we announced V2 in 2022 and then FTX dropped its bombshell and then in 2023 we announced the Drift Token. This year I'm really delighted to announce that drift raised $25 million. Series B led by Multicon Capital.
05:32:14.665 - 05:32:42.671, Speaker A: Thank you very much. And it just goes to show how far we've come as an ecosystem. Honestly, if you had asked me, is this platform able to route $50 billion in volume? Are we able to have 500 million in TVL last year? I would have told you. You're insane. We were at 20mil when we presented this at Breakpoint last year. Our goal for the end of the year was 10. And now fast forward, that's a 50x increase.
05:32:42.671 - 05:33:08.137, Speaker A: So to all the audience members, thank you for being part of what makes Breakpoint special. I think, you know, coming out to Singapore might not be the easiest for those in the States. I recently spent more time in the States too, came from the us so I know just how far it is to get here. But without the community, this ecosystem honestly wouldn't be where it is today. So that's all for me. I don't want to say more. I think everyone has been extremely dialed in.
05:33:08.137 - 05:33:29.331, Speaker A: We're going to adjourn for a short break right now. Come back here at 4:20 for a debate on. Actually no, I Won't tell you the topic. I think I'm going to hold that and then you guys can come here and then I will announce what that is. But please don't stray too far. We have a really exciting debate taking place in just under 15 minutes. 420.
05:33:29.331 - 05:48:16.765, Speaker A: That's the magic number. See you all soon. Sa sa, sa sa sa. Again, please silence your devices, take a seat and get ready for the show. Come on forward. Don't be shy. All these debates hopefully have more people engaged responding to the respective debate participants.
05:48:16.765 - 05:49:00.131, Speaker A: Oh my God, these lights are really blinding. Honestly, even during the short 20 minutes I was off stage during the break, people have been asking me, how do I book a Lambo ride in one of those drift cars outside? I'm going to address this now because in the space of 20 minutes, I got a bunch of DMs, go to our booth and talk to our team. Obviously, I think there are only five cars and many more than five people out here. So if that is of interest, please just rock up. I think there are a few challenges they're actually doing, so people that win those challenges, I think get it right. So please don't ask me anymore. The opportunity is there, should you take it? But without further ado, I do want to bring up the next debate.
05:49:00.131 - 05:49:30.383, Speaker A: This will be my last announcement, unfortunately, so you won't see me and hear my Aussie accent anymore. But it's been obviously fun. You guys have been a great crowd. Next up, I believe this is a topic that's honestly quite close to me as well. It's whether large scale apps will deploy their L2. Is that Netville or not? I have some views on that, but I don't want to comment or steer the course of this debate. But without further ado, I want to introduce first our moderator, Zaki, if he wants to come up first.
05:49:30.383 - 05:50:05.605, Speaker A: And then on either side, Mason from Pantera and Ben from Meteora. You guys have been great. Enjoy the debate. See you all soon. All right. Okay. I have a gong, which seems fun.
05:50:05.605 - 05:50:34.535, Speaker A: Cool. My name is Zucky. I will be moderating long time, sort of sovereign chain builder. But like now at this point, pretty much it's all the same. So I'm excited to Purely neutral in my opinion. And Ben from Eudora. And also he has this LP Army, LP rights advocate sort of Persona, I guess.
05:50:34.535 - 05:50:45.419, Speaker A: And Mason from Pantera. All right, who's going first? Sure. Happy to. Okay. Sad. I don't know. Do you want to hear the.
05:50:45.419 - 05:51:36.487, Speaker A: Do you want to do the gong? Let's do the gong. Hey everyone. I'm excited to chat today for the affirmation that every large app should inevitably launch its own L2 or L1. The lifecycle of an application typically starts on an app launching on a general purpose chain in order to get access to users distribution liquidity until it gets sufficiently large where it can launch its own chain. We've seen this time and time again throughout Crypto from applications like pith, which was 10 to 20% of Solana transactions until it launched its own L1. We've seen this timeless times again on Ethereum, and we've now started to see it even more in Solana with apps like Zeta, Grass, Code, Helium, all launching their own network extensions. And I think there's really three reasons that apps want to inevitably launch their own L2s.
05:51:36.487 - 05:52:40.380, Speaker A: The first is to control greater economic and greater value capture. By owning your own block space and controlling the sequencer, you can capture not only your traditional app revenue, but also you can capture revenue that your app facilitates as part of that ecosystem. This has obviously been very profitable for Coinbase and Base, as well as general purpose rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism. The second core reason is that apps want to control and customize their own block space. By controlling your own block space, you can have custom execution environments, you can have additional usability features like gas abstraction, and then you can also get access to cheaper block space so you're not competing on the global state layer and higher throughput if you need it. And then the last reason is that Solana is obviously a global state machine that has been quite successful and that success in demand for block space will naturally exceed supply and push new applications to launch their own L2s rather than launch on mainnet. And even though Solana has been incredibly successful, its TPS is around 3,000 today.
05:52:40.380 - 05:53:20.505, Speaker A: For context, global credit card payments are around 22,000 per second. And so even just to put credit card payments on chain would be, you know, a magnitude increase in Salon as tps. When you start to factor in other applications like Defi, it obviously becomes too much and that's going to push other apps to launch their own L2s. The last thing I'd say is earlier today I saw just the opening and president of Solana foundation literally was saying that we're rationalists, not maximalists. And apps already see the reality of today. They want to own their own economics, they want to own their own block space. The rational take is that the future of Solana is modular and that is a bright future.
05:53:20.505 - 05:55:11.551, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay, Ben. Yeah. I think that's some fantastic points here. I don't know, I would like to just open it up with a few spicy point of views here because I think that basically if you're choosing to build your own app chain, right, I really think it's kind of like you're looking to basically go on an island and build by yourself, right? And that, you know, one of the things you have to understand is like being on a thriving ecosystem, there is a lot of power in being able to integrate, compose and work together with other projects to like grow your user base, grow alliances and other partners in the ecosystem, and sort of like build a bigger mission together than it is to then go on your own island and build by yourself, right? Because there's a lot you have to build before you can even attract people, right? And I kind of feel like fundamentally underneath all of this, there's this kind of builder attitude or expectation. Like, I see a lot of problems here and I want to just go fix it myself, right? And I would like to like, offer up a different perspective in suggesting that instead of, you know, it's much easier, of course, to just, you know, be that builder who builds everything, but to like, find ways to work together to build a better solution. And I think oftentimes a lot of these solutions, they're a little bit slower, you know, it takes a little bit more time.
05:55:11.551 - 05:55:41.793, Speaker A: Maybe it's a little bit more annoying to work with some other people, right? But like, you're building value for everyone, right? You're actually like lifting all the, like lifting everyone together instead of like building your own island, you know? Okay, I don't know. You had a spicier take backstage. I want to hear. You want me to throw it out there? Okay, I'm going to throw it out there. Fine, fine. I'm going to sum it up right. If you're building for your own app chain, you're building for VCs.
05:55:41.793 - 05:56:43.581, Speaker A: If you're building versus building for users, right? Because honestly, it's really fucking hard to get users, right? To build, like to build momentum, to build traction, to find product market fit, to get distribution, to get out there, right? And if you decide to also spend that time building the plumbing, you know, building up the validator network, finding the right incentives, right? How can you succeed in building up your user base? I think it's really hard. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess the. I think it's initially like important for applications and the reason they launch on a general purpose chain or on an L2 is to get access so that they're not on an island. But over time, once an app has its own distribution, its own users, its own liquidity, the economic incentives, I think, have clearly shown that people are going to be pushed towards launching their own chains. Do you have an example that you want to.
05:56:43.581 - 05:58:12.265, Speaker A: I mean, so I think like worldcoin on Ethereum is probably a good example, where at one point they were 50% of the transactions on optimism. And when you end up being a large percentage of the reason of the economic activity in any given chain, it makes more sense for you to just launch your own chain because then you don't have to compete with the other applications. And maybe with the exception of Defi, I would say the component composability you get is typically not quite worth, you know, the customization and, like, cheaper block space that you can get. I would argue that one of the problems with doing that, even though that's a good example, is that you're then a homogeneous app chain, right? And it's kind of like, you know, if you have like one species, like one disease can just wipe you out, right? And we've seen this, like a lot of niches on crypto are cyclical, right? NFTs were up, meme coins were down, Meme coins are up, NFTs are down, right. But the nice thing is in a heterogeneous, like, diverse network, right, it can thrive even if one sector is down. If you're just one sector, that's your entire chain, you will go down. What do you do? Yeah, I mean, I think you're definitely offering yourself.
05:58:12.265 - 05:58:52.503, Speaker A: With greater risk comes greater reward. And so like, when I. Obviously a lot of Solana apps have not yet launched their network extensions, I think the reason that they're launching them is either because they want to own. Own their own block space because it's just too expensive to be on mainnet, or they want higher throughput or I think a lot of them just see it as a mechanism by which, like, if you're going to facilitate all this activity, like Helium, for example, you don't really need that. Activity is not super tied to mainnet on Solana. And so you would rather internalize all of the economic activity that happens through there. And I think that is a driving force.
05:58:52.503 - 05:59:06.457, Speaker A: I mean, in many ways, though, helium is the. Is the example of the opposite. They were an app chain and then they became an application on Solana. And we don't know where the future holds. But how do you. How do you. I mean, like World Coin I think is the great.
05:59:06.457 - 05:59:37.603, Speaker A: Is a great example of, you know, of the net of like this evolutionary force and economic forcing function towards app chains. I think Helium is a great example of an app chain is a giant pain in the ass. And like, why would you. If you don't have to bear those costs, like, why do it? Right, Sorry. So, yeah, just like, you know, you give it an opportunity to kind of. Oh, comment on like either of those things. Well, I guess so.
05:59:37.603 - 06:00:18.235, Speaker A: Helium is launching a network extension or at least they announced it. Okay. I think they, they don't want to be in L1 anymore. I guess they didn't want to in L1, decide they want to be on mainnet now decide they want to be an L2. But I guess one question I would pose is like, as you see, other apps, especially in particular on Solana, launch these network extensions. Like, what do you, why do you believe that they're going down that path? I mean, like, I think it's, there's probably not a universal thing. Like clearly, like part of it is trying to solve some of the technical issues, right? Like maybe the, you know, the underlying blockchain isn't ready yet.
06:00:18.235 - 06:01:14.695, Speaker A: At the same time, I would say argue, like, just because there's problems now, it doesn't mean it doesn't get fixed in the future. You know, it's sort of like Toli's thing. Like, you know, processing speed increases over time and so like we can take advantage of that trend. Right. And I believe in that same sort of velocity and improvements on Solana itself. But it's hard to say in a specific case like Helium, but maybe sometimes their technical requirements, they just need it now so they have to make some hard decisions and choices. And maybe they found out that integrations or composability with other parts of the ecosystem, you know, isn't, you know, like, isn't as valuable to them, you know, So I don't really know.
06:01:14.695 - 06:02:11.635, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's, it's. To me it seems fairly clear that the trade offs, unless you're in DEFI today, are very much worth launching your own chain. DEFI is maybe the exception of, of a initial pool of capital like that liquidity is initially sticky and you want access to it. I think that you can maybe even make the argument though that if a DEFI application on Solana becomes sufficiently large, it has an incentive to capture more of the economic value. You can potentially imagine a world in which a Dex on Solana very much captures its own value through its own fees of its app Today. But if it were to launch its own chain and become this global liquidity layer, it would capture all the fees from any economic activity rather than just its own swaps. I'd be curious if that vision of a future you think over time is probable or even likely.
06:02:11.635 - 06:02:51.235, Speaker A: You know, I can't argue that point. I actually agree with that point. Whether or not that, I mean, I'm a composability maxi, like whether or not that's the future I want to see. I actually think that it's a different point. But for me, actually one thing that I think we haven't seen that is more composability. I see more apps actually centralizing, building more features themselves, more services broadening out. And even if they're not doing nav chain, they're doing that, you know, on the L1.
06:02:51.235 - 06:03:18.705, Speaker A: Right. So that's something that's been an interesting trend to notice, at least on Solana vs like people actually building on top of each other. But I hope that changes. Actually, that's. Yeah, I hope it changes too. I would. But I mean, even looking towards Ethereum, you have a lot more applications there trying to internalize and privatize their order flow.
06:03:18.705 - 06:04:15.377, Speaker A: Even in the defi landscape. You know, something like Uniswap X is an off chain order book. And so that of course is like another potential centralizing force or like it blocks some of the composability advantage that you would get from liquidity because it just ends up being owned by one application. I think it then brings up an interesting question of the application versus the protocol and whether the application itself can drive that protocol to launch its own chain. Or maybe you end up do having protocols that exist across chains and they are relatively composable with one another, but there's some application that just abstracts everything from the user. Yeah, I mean, for me, I guess also for me, I think people lock in on certain beliefs, right. And like you made a really good point that like, well, you can capture more value, Right.
06:04:15.377 - 06:04:44.883, Speaker A: If you have your own chain. That's true. Right. And so if that's something that you want to do, you can. But I actually don't think that that's the only way to capture more value. So one thing I would sort of, sort of an interesting dilemma and I think it goes to this like VC versus user question is like, who does the application serve? Is it the value capture for the token holders or is it the users of the app? And do you think that's a dilemma that matters? Yeah, it does matter. Right.
06:04:44.883 - 06:05:31.415, Speaker A: Because. Okay, here's the argument for users and not value capture, right, Is because if you're thinking long term, right, you need a user base. You need people who love to use your product, who can't stop using your product. And they're not there to farm you, they're not there to, you know, like that. I mean, I wouldn't even call some people mercenaries, but some people are just like, they come in, they like the hype, they do a few things and they're out, right? And I think part of the problem that people, you know, if you're working on things, they've a lot. I think there's too much focus on that hype that, you know, like airdrop farming. We're going to get all these people and they're going to turn into users magically and they actually don't.
06:05:31.415 - 06:06:59.965, Speaker A: And the harder thing, which takes time, is like, look, how do I have product market fit? Like, how do I get my users to stay? Like, how are they like engaging? Are they getting real value where they're coming back day after day, you know, and not for some external incentive or some game mechanic, some tokenomic game I'm playing, you know, I mean, that's, you know, and then if you're playing those games, how long are you going to last as an app chain? As an app or whatever? I mean, yeah, I mean I definitely, I agree with the vision for crypto where users either get more value from the applications than is extracted from them, or at least get value in ways that they don't have to be locked into any particular service. Say they have more freedom of choice because the end Rails and protocols are more permissionless. I still, and this is probably the VC in me, think that like the protocols need to capture value in some way just because like ultimately the protocols and apps that succeed have a very virtuous flywheel where the application provides service on top of the protocol. The protocol itself can be a public good, but the application needs to somehow be able to drive growth as well as like protocol development. Well, okay, we only got three minutes left. So you want to do like a 90 second sum up and go last because you got to go first. Sure.
06:06:59.965 - 06:08:17.765, Speaker A: I think in summary, I very much see a world where Solana, Ethereum, any blockchain, the applications on top are going to continue to get great value from the underlying applications, but eventually over time they'll inevitably want to capture more value, own their own block space and launch their own L2, maybe even in some instances. And ultimately I don't think that is Bad, I will say for the underlying mainnet, I think that that is good. I think the future is modular and that's okay. It means that the apps and the protocols can both capture a lot of value and more importantly, give value to users. I think what does it say about blockchain if you know apps? Like, the path forward is that apps can capture value and that you have to be a chain. You know, I think like, this is a perfect model, right? Like you can build an app for a phone and make a lot of money and that makes the ecosystem powerful. If you're saying I have to build the phone to also capture value, I mean, didn't Solana build a phone? That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right.
06:08:17.765 - 06:08:46.271, Speaker A: All right. I mean, we've got like. I mean, I agree with you. The last thing I'd say is, like, what's important is not the block space, but the value on top. And so block space, I think, is quickly becoming a commodity, which is why I think applications will seek to own it. Okay, why don't we do claps for which side won round of applause? Okay. From the audience.
06:08:46.271 - 06:09:20.985, Speaker A: Do a little interactive. All right, Any last hot takes for you? Any last hot takes for me? I'm fully on the path that basically, like I spent a decade building sovereign chain infrastructure, and at this point I'm like, everything. Like Solana is doing multi proposer. Solana is doing application specific secret sequencing. Okay. And network extensions. And all of the modular stuff is doing some form of shared security, some form of integrated, like shared sequencing, base sequencing, whatnot.
06:09:20.985 - 06:09:56.571, Speaker A: Okay. Are these things any different from each other at this point? No, they're just like, everybody's building the same thing. So it's currently where I'm at, but we've got to pick a winner. So. Okay, who wants to clap for the modular future and the integrated future? Thank you. All right, I think it's very clear the audience is definitely biased, so good job. All right, thank you very much.
06:09:56.571 - 06:10:56.835, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you so much to our debaters for that last session. That was wonderful. This is Caitlin Cook from Moonwalk Fitness. I'll be carrying you guys through the rest of the programming. For day one of break point, we next up we have three wonderful lightning talks followed by the last debate of the day and a fireside chat. So we hope you'll stick around with us for all of those.
06:10:56.835 - 06:11:43.585, Speaker A: To finish out the day with that, let's welcome our first lightning talk to the stage. Muneeb, founder of Stacks All Right. Hey everyone, I'm Muneeb, founder of Saks. I'm gonna keep it short and sweet. There are two main things I'm going to talk about. First is just to give you an overview and update on the exciting things that have been happening on the Bitcoin L2 space. And then we have a little alpha to drop for all the Solana Devices developers who are sitting here in the audience.
06:11:43.585 - 06:12:18.935, Speaker A: So stacks the project, we basically focus on unlocking Bitcoin capital. I think it's a no brainer that there's more than a trillion dollars of bitcoin capital sitting there. Developers are not programming it, they're not deploying it in big ways into DeFi, and that's what our project sort of focuses on. To give you a comparison on Ethereum, Ethereum is roughly like one third or less the size, but the capital is actually pretty fluid, liquid and is productive. People can deploy it in a lot of contracts in a lot of different ways. They can earn yields. Whereas that's not happening with Bitcoin right now.
06:12:18.935 - 06:13:03.139, Speaker A: And we think that's a massive, massive opportunity. And not a lot of developers are actually working on it right now. So what's the, what's the bottleneck? And I think if you might have heard a lot of skepticism for Bitcoin L2s, that they're not trustless, like they aren't really L2s. And that's one thing that I want to quickly talk about, that there have been recently some amazing technical breakthroughs that massively reduce the trust factor of Bitcoin L2s. There's one project called BitVM that takes you from a M of N security model on the bridge to one of N. Meaning you only need one honest party and your bitcoin can actually move freely between the L1 and the L2, and that that honest party could be you yourself. There's a bunch of other exciting stuff happening.
06:13:03.139 - 06:13:53.215, Speaker A: People are working on roll ups, they're working on other types of consensus mechanisms. Stacks itself is going through a massive upgrade where you have fast blocks. But I'll spare you those details. If you're a developer and you're excited about working with bitcoin capital, I think that is something that is a growing area and our project is sort of like focused on bringing that to market. So what's the missing thing? I think what a lot of people don't understand is that a lot of BTC capital sits in the hands where these people are decentralization freaks. They don't want to go through routes where they either have to do KYC, they don't want to actually pay get like 1099, they don't want to pay taxes on their capital. So a lot of the existing solutions like for example through Bitco or WBDC actually doesn't meet those requirements.
06:13:53.215 - 06:14:49.051, Speaker A: People are looking for decentralized bridges where they can actually go wrap, unwrap, don't have to pay any wrapping fees and don't have to trust any single company. That's the work that Stacks has been doing with the design of sbdc and the little sort of like alpha that we want to drop here is that the Stacks developers are currently working on bringing SBDC to Solana. Why Solana? Because the next step, so the first step is think of that as the Rails, right? So the mental model is Bitcoin the asset is different from Bitcoin the Rails. Yes, we agree that Bitcoin L1 the rails suck. You can't program anything there, it's slow as hell. But Bitcoin the asset is amazing. So you can change the Rails, you can bring Bitcoin the asset to different Rails, you can bring it to faster places where you can program it in spm, other other things that you, that you want to do.
06:14:49.051 - 06:15:45.355, Speaker A: And with this basically with our developer community we are also trying to move into Rust. That's another thing that the developers here are going to appreciate. So if the bridge design and the apps that are native running close to Bitcoin, they're running in similar languages as what you might be used to on Solana, there could be a lot of cross pollination of interesting things happening there. That is something that I'm super excited about. Came here to give you a brief overview of the landscape in Bitcoin L2s, why a decentralized, open, permissionless Bitcoin asset is important and how we are working on bringing it to Solana. Thank you so much. Thank you so much Muneeb.
06:15:45.355 - 06:16:34.305, Speaker A: Next up we will have a product keynote from Wormhole. Please give a warm welcome to Dan Reaser and Robinson Berkey. Hey everyone, Dan Reaser and Robinson Berkey. We're the co founders of the Wormhole foundation and really happy to be here today to talk you through some history of Wormhole as well as a big product launch that we're excited to launch. So I'm going to go back to 2020 when wormhole first started and we actually started out with the initial goal of connecting Solana to Ethereum which sounds very basic now but we've come Quite a long way. And so has Solana. We were the first ever token bridge for the Solana ecosystem.
06:16:34.305 - 06:17:09.637, Speaker A: We actually saw immediate product market fit that has grown quite a bit up until today. And then the entire platform today is secured by the Guardian set. The Guardian set got going in this time period and has now grown to to 20, including Google Cloud which we just announced yesterday. And then let's move on to 2021. Sorry, yeah, 2021 to 2024, which is era two of wormhole. This is where we released the first ever general message passing protocol which allows any form of data or value to flow cross chain. During this period we expanded to 30 chains.
06:17:09.637 - 06:17:44.075, Speaker A: We've expanded to support over 200 applications across the industry and we really took that initial product and built this into an entire platform from a lot of feedback that we got from the developer community, including probably many of you in the room. Now this is a look at our, at our platform prior to today. So I'm going to start actually in the bottom. Bottom right. Wormhole messaging is kind of the foundation of everything built on top of Wormhole. This powers again data or value, including Uniswap governance data going cross chain. JITO is leveraging our pull based query solution.
06:17:44.075 - 06:18:23.001, Speaker A: Rapstake, Deeth and Lido is one example of a team using native token transfers, which is our cross chain token transfer framework. And then going up to the top are more of the developer tools. So the SDK which many developers in the room are probably using to build with Wormhole and then connect, which allows any application to seamlessly integrate Wormhole in their app with just three lines of code. And this is a look at our volume to date versus some similar protocols in the industry. So we're really happy to be first in the industry. We've processed over a billion messages since 2020 and continue to grow this daily as we move on. So Robinson, go ahead.
06:18:23.001 - 06:18:56.605, Speaker A: We're now moving into ERA three for Wormhole. We call it the era of experience, focusing a lot on the user. So Wormhole Era 3 is composed of a few different things. First, we're launching our intense protocol. So we actually have two intense protocols we're launching with one enables native to native swaps, the other one does that as well. But it also gives builders the ability to actually build protocols on top of it. It is also powered by Solana, which you'll see here in a slide of what that looks like upgrading Portal.
06:18:56.605 - 06:19:30.647, Speaker A: A lot of people may be familiar with Portal, the front end that a lot of the asset transfers powered by Wormhole goes through, we're launching Wormhole Institutional. We'll go into that in a slide here in a second. Upgrading Connect, which Dan just talked about, upgrading the SDK and then our Block Explorer, Wormhole scans, getting a whole new look. And then with this new era, we've got a number of different integrators, a lot of them native to the Solana ecosystem that are adopting a lot of these products. So Wormhole is vertically integrated. It isn't just like sending one message cross chain. It is a platform with a number of different products.
06:19:30.647 - 06:20:11.681, Speaker A: So a developer can do anything multichain. So we have the infrastructure layer, the asset layer and the application layer. Dan went over most of this, but we're adding to the asset layer native swaps. So really what users want is to be able to go from a native asset to a native asset and do it as fast as possible possible. And at the infrastructure layer we're adding this composable intense network and we'll what we'll click to the next slide and we'll see what that looks like. So this is powered by Solana. So we've been building this protocol for over a year now and effectively you're able to put together or pool together stablecoins, USDC on Solana and then route through Solana for any source and destination chain.
06:20:11.681 - 06:20:55.861, Speaker A: What it gives you effectively is you're able to go from a native asset on one chain to a native asset on another and compose actions. So as part of this upgrade, we're also improving the Wormhole Connect product which is embedded in Portal. So if you've been using wormhole since 2020, the wrap tokens were the original solution for token transfers. Now we have ntt, but today with the announcement of the Wormhole intense product, Portal has gotten a massive upgrade in terms of speed and cost. And we're really happy to say that this actually went live about four hours ago. So anyone can go try out the product. When you get some time with Portal, you'll see of course, speed and cost changes, UI UX changes things like transaction history.
06:20:55.861 - 06:21:36.641, Speaker A: Just a lot of improvements across the board. And here's a quick look at the ui. I'm going to flip through this relatively quickly because we have a quick demo to show you an actual transaction going through. So this is native eth going from base into native Sol on Solana in just eight seconds. Done. So I'm going to keep it quick because we're out of time. Last thing, Robinson.
06:21:36.641 - 06:21:59.323, Speaker A: Just about an hour ago you may have seen announced our partnership with Securitize to bring all of their current and future tokenized assets. Multichain. This is kind of kicking off our institutional push. We're also working with AMD and Google Cloud to contribute to the Wormhole stack on the ZK side as well as the Guardian Security side. And thank you for the attention. That's ERA three. See you guys soon.
06:21:59.323 - 06:22:43.185, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you so much. Dan and Robinson. Next up, to round out the last of our product keynotes for the day, please give a warm welcome to Roon Christensen of Sky, formerly MakerDAO. Everyone. Super glad to be here. Exciting to see such a huge crowd.
06:22:43.185 - 06:24:13.579, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm here to talk about SK sky on Solana. So, all right, let's start with what exactly is Sky? Well, we used to be called Maker just up until very recently. Sky is an upgrade and rebrand of the Maker Protocol, which is the oldest and most profitable defi ecosystem, the world's largest decentralized stablecoin with about, yeah, a bit more than 5 billion stablecoins in circulation. And what's coming, or rather what has already been launched with sky, is an upgraded stablecoin called usds, an upgraded governance token called sky that you actually can upgrade one to 24,000 when you upgrade your MKR, and then some new and unique features including the ability to get sky tokens as rewards on your USDS stablecoins. And this has been really successful. So in the last 36 hours, there's already been 400 million USDs minted into existence that are currently getting these token rewards and utilizing all of the integrations that are have been made with USDs. So that's super exciting and well, basically I'm here today to talk about how this is coming to Solana.
06:24:13.579 - 06:26:17.255, Speaker A: So very soon, just around the corner, the USDS stablecoin, the Sky Governance token, and then the tokenized form of the savings rate is all going to launch on Solana with Wormhole. And to accompany that, there will be a large liquidity incentive program that will offer sky tokens to people who use all the different defi protocols on Solana that integrate USDS and Sky. Thanks guys. So why is this such a good fit? Well, obviously sky is going to bring big defi energy to Solana. You know, we're talking about a collateral portfolio of, yeah, like more than 8 billion and that's going to be, it's going to be possible to allocate that collateral into defi protocols in Solana and help with things like bootstrapping the RWA ecosystem on Solana and the reason why sky just generally is such a big, I mean it's so focused on Solana is because there is a history and an experience in researching and understanding the tech stack, going all the way back to the efforts of sky basically towards building its own L1 and looking into the SVM stack as a candidate for that. And just generally sky itself is engineered in a way to be able to properly exploit the performance of something as performant as the Solana tech stack because of the ability to have parallelized governance. So yeah, this is just a really good fit I think, and it's basically just the beginning because where this really is going is towards the native deployment of the sky protocol call onto Solana through Solana Skylink.
06:26:17.255 - 06:27:20.515, Speaker A: So what this means is in addition to all the tokens, there'll also be nearly unlimited native one to one conversion between USDs and USDC on Solana. The sky token rewards and some of the other token rewards that are coming with sky will also be available natively on Solana as programs on Solana. And all of this will be available from the main Skydive money front end. And the goal is to synergize and integrate and help really boost and incubate the growing and really, really exciting and dynamic ecosystem on Solana. So of course the whole point is to work with a lot of really cool projects in ecosystem and as I mentioned earlier, there will be a major incentive program to basically drive adoption of the new tokens on all of these platforms. So yeah, thanks everyone and I hope you're going to be using some USDs and Sky on Solana soon. Thank you.
06:27:20.515 - 06:28:52.635, Speaker A: Hello Singapore, I'm Caitlin Cook from Moonwalk Fitness. Heard my voice over the mic putting a face to the name. I'm here to emcee through the rest of day one for Breakpoint. We are finished up with the Lightning talks for the for the day. Going into the last debate of day one, NFTs have been an incredibly divisive topic on the crypto amongst the crypto community, especially over the last year or so. We're bringing out two of the foremost leaders in the space to debate. Are NFTs dead? Please welcome Luca from Pudgy Penguins and Frank D Gods Moderating Tiff from Magic Eden.
06:28:52.635 - 06:29:29.347, Speaker A: All right, I have a gong, so if you guys are talking for too long, definitely gonna gonna use this. Hey everyone, my name is Tiff. Quick correction. I don't actually work at Magic Eden anymore. I work at Emmy Foundation. I'm working on the token launch me which will be adopted by Magic Eden as their official token reflecting the power of cross chain Dapps. You guys wanna.
06:29:29.347 - 06:29:52.421, Speaker A: Fellas, wanna introduce yourselves really quick? Yeah, I'm. I'm Luke Annette. I'm the CEO of Igloo, which holds pudgy penguins in abstract. Frank D Gods. I jit Solana at the bottom and run D Gods. Yeah. All right, so I think the way this is going to run is I'm going to give my opening remarks and then we'll just get into it.
06:29:52.421 - 06:30:31.235, Speaker A: I'm taking the position. So obviously I don't think NFTs are dead, but in a strange twist of events, I have to flood my own bags. So I'm going to talk about why I think NFTs are dead and then we'll just kind of riff. So the reason why NFTs are perceived as dead is mostly because of the trading volume. If you compare NFT trading volume in the height of, I think it was January in 22, when Ethereum NFTs had like $4 billion in trade volume. If you look at the last 30 days, they had like $400 million in trading volume across all of the marketplaces. So that's kind of like one of the reasons why people think NFTs are dead.
06:30:31.235 - 06:31:15.343, Speaker A: Some of the causes for why this might have happened would be, number one, the fact that creator royalties became optional. This was something that the ecosystem thought was baked in. For sure, royalties would always exist, but basically everybody found out that they can actually be bypassable and that's what marketplaces ended up doing. The second thing is that, and maybe these are like tied, right? These reasons are tied together, but there haven't been a lot of new use cases coming out of NFTs. The most dominant form of NFTs still remains PFPs. And when we thought that NFTs were going to be the future of music ticketing, not a lot of that stuff has happened. We've maybe seen some bright shoots on, like deepin projects using NFTs or gaming projects using NFTs, but those are not.
06:31:15.343 - 06:32:06.071, Speaker A: Haven't been dominant to really bring NFTs back. And then the third thing, which is probably the outcome of these two things, is like know new retail participants. So we had a lot of new people who joined crypto in 21 and they were trading NFTs, but a lot of those folks either left or they pivoted into something else. And so if we think of NFTs as like an asset class, that's like tokens, like something to speculate on and trade, then objectively NFTS are not as alive as they were in 2021. So I will just kind of start asking spicy questions. So, Frank, you recently dropped a token called D God. So isn't that your way of kind of leaving NFTs? And you know, what is, in your own words, what is the optimistic outlook for NFTs at this point? Yeah, I don't think we left NFTs.
06:32:06.071 - 06:32:34.245, Speaker A: I think NFTs have been going in this direction. So to do a recap of history, I think a lot of this NFT craze started with people's one of one selling. And so that was like a 101 and the whole meta was one of one art. And then they became slightly more fungible. You had like board apes, you had 10k pfp collections, which is like where Luke and I came in, and those were more fungible. You had trading with them. Then you have collect marketplaces start to form and then you have collection offers which look a lot like an order book.
06:32:34.245 - 06:33:29.605, Speaker A: You know, you have bids and asks and so over time nft and then obviously royalties go away, like sell taxes go away. So I actually think there's an argument that NFTs have been going in a direction because of the market of being more and more fungible. So I think what we're doing, or you know, we always get shit, we're always trying stuff, but what we're trying to say here is, you know, the same community that's formed over the last three years, we're just turning that, giving that community more optionality and putting it in a different vehicle. But we're not trying to, you know, abandoned NFTs, it's more just giving the community more optionality and, you know, let's fucking see what happens. So I think the communities that form because of NFTs are real and you can only form some of these communities with a finite number of assets and that's what lets them get strong. But then over time I think they can evolve. And that's like the D God take right now is like we're trying to evolve.
06:33:29.605 - 06:34:08.683, Speaker A: Yeah. Isn't this just a nice way of saying you're trying to diversify outside of NFTs? It's just like saying that the NFT crowd is not intertwined with crypto, but it, but it is, you know, like it's, I think, the mythical kind of pure retail people that only buy NFTs at this point. If you're still in crypto, you've dabbled with a lot of different things. I always say like the same it used to be, hey, what's minting today? Now it's. What's the contract address? But it's the same crowd of people that were doing the DJ and mints that are now getting into meme coins. So I think the people have ultimately stayed relatively the same, but the vehicle that they're using to trade is just, like, different. And it kind of.
06:34:08.683 - 06:34:30.725, Speaker A: It makes sense. Like, it's expensive to buy a full packet, like a full nft, compared to buying, like, a part of a network. Like, which I think that they're both doing the same thing. So. Okay, one more question for you, and then I'll go to Luca. So what I'm hearing is that a lot of the behaviors that people ape into are for meme coins instead of NFTs today. So having meme coins largely just replace the need for NFTs.
06:34:30.725 - 06:35:06.663, Speaker A: Like, why would anybody create a new NFT collection if meme coins are also cultural and they're also fun and. And you can put the moguls on and like, yeah, like, they've infiltrated the PFP as well. Well, I think you're asking the big question. Like, we're not seeing new mints. And typically in any economy, when people aren't making new stuff, it gets more difficult. I actually think we could see the rise of small collections again. So maybe big fungible, if you follow my analogy, big fungible collections, like a 10k pfp, maybe there's not really any demand or desire for people to make more of those.
06:35:06.663 - 06:35:28.545, Speaker A: But even on Solana, there's a small collection called Boogles. A lot of you guys probably know it's very coinless, So I can go, you know, like, they've created something that really impacts the entire chain, like a small community. And I think that could become more of a use case again for NFTs. Like, we might go full circle back to 100 ones to smaller collections. That makes sense to me, that something. Something people would want to buy. Yeah.
06:35:28.545 - 06:35:57.947, Speaker A: All right. And honestly, I would love to chime into ultimately what Frank is doing. I don't think what Frank is doing is leaving NFTs. I think there's an elephant in the room if I'm in a steel, man. You know, one why I think NFTs are seeing a bad time at the current moment is I think the successful NFTs are too illiquid for whales and priced out of retail. And so somebody came to me in regards to pudgy penguins, and they were like, dude, you know, everyone's rallying behind you guys, everyone's supporting what you guys are doing. But a $30,000 penguin is too expensive for most retail buyers.
06:35:57.947 - 06:36:35.063, Speaker A: And on the other side of it, you know, a whale who really wants to support you, you know, can't really put $10 million on your floor because old, ultimately, it's hard to get in and out of that. And so I actually think Frank's experiment is one that I'm personally rooting for and one that I'm super excited about because I don't think they're mutually exclusive. I don't think to do a meme coin is to then neglect the nft. The NFT is actually super interesting in the sense that it creates a form of tribalism and community because of the identity in which you wear it on social. That I think is unparalleled. And you also brought something up in regards to meme coins. I'm a huge supporter of meme coins, but I do think there's an elephant in the room in terms of the distribution of meme coins.
06:36:35.063 - 06:37:24.131, Speaker A: Unpopular to most. Actually, most meme coins, based on my knowledge and the people that I've spoken to, are low float, high ftv. Though it might look like on the chart that it's, you know, fully, fairly distributed, it's actually not if you know, a lot of the people behind these things. And so from my perspective, you know, I still think NFTs today are the best way to distribute amongst a fair amount or a fair distribution amongst the right amount of people in a way that I still think is unparalleled. So I think there's something about identity that's not to be underestimated. This idea of being able to wear something knowing that when you're either wearing a pudgy penguin or a D God, you're able to identify what that person is into and maybe their interests and that access and that connectivity. I tell this to entrepreneurs all the time, but know 95% of my income was based on who I know, not what I know.
06:37:24.131 - 06:37:55.917, Speaker A: And NFTs build relationships in a way that's unparalleled. So, you know, an NFT being worth, you know, maybe $10,000 or $50,000 or, you know, half a million dollars, ultimately can make sense depending on the access that you get. And still nothing has come close to that. Let me ask a little bit more about what you're doing. So you guys are building a chain called Abstract. Can you explain to me why does pudgy penguin need to have a chain? And isn't that just another way of kind of finding diversification outside of NFTs as well. I think our mission pretty much since day one is to push consumer adoption.
06:37:55.917 - 06:38:33.391, Speaker A: And so the chain part of our business is really like, we're looking around, we want to stay. You know, I'm in the EVM boat, so huge respect to all the Solana folks. I have a lot of respect for this team and the community, but, you know, I wanted to stay Ethereum aligned. And when looking at Ethereum ecosystem, nobody's owning consumer and no one's solving the consumer problems. So I think for the last two and a half years, we've been kind of trailblazing what I like to call consumer crypto, really trying to meet consumers where they are and break boundaries and push barriers in terms of, you know, what that adoption looks like in the space. And this is just another piece to our ecosystem in which we can kind of power our Web2 products. You got to understand, you know, Pudgy Penguins is more than just an NFT on the blockchain.
06:38:33.391 - 06:39:08.499, Speaker A: We have, you know, toys that we're selling in Walmart and Target. We have, you know, billions of views that we get every single month on social. You know, we are doing things and trying to push products that are going to appeal to mass. And ultimately I need the underlying infrastructure to do that. And so rather than going to somebody else who I felt at the time that I still don't know anybody that I think is fulfilling the needs that I need fulfilled as a consumer crypto builder, we decided that we needed to take the leap ourselves and build it ourselves. So I don't think they have nothing to do with one another outside of, you know, I think the benefits that the holders will get, you know, from that ecosystem, I'm succeeding, to me, it's just another layer to ultimately the igloo, which is the company that we're building. Cool.
06:39:08.499 - 06:39:32.715, Speaker A: I'll ask you the spicy question. So what would you say to people who are saying, oh, pudgy penguins, NFTs are going down. This is just like them finding like something, something new to do that can extract more value. We haven't extracted any value up until this point. I mean, we bought the business for two and a half million dollars. We put $500,000 in the bank and we bootstrapped this thing with a 9 out outside of a $9 million raise, but we haven't taken any money. So this idea that we're extracting value, I think is.
06:39:32.715 - 06:39:52.463, Speaker A: You must not know our business if you're saying that. So I Think from our perspective, you know, we're in the business of creating value. I think the last two and a half years has been exactly that. I don't think anyone can say that we've done otherwise. So we're in the business of creating value for the entire space and for the entire industry. But more specifically our holders. I mean, my loyalty starts and stops with them.
06:39:52.463 - 06:40:47.685, Speaker A: And when you, when you kind of understand the flywheel that this could kind of create an ecosystem like this could kind of create, you know, a big thing for pudgy penguins was in the last, you know, nine months we got, you know, $25,000 in airdrops and third party airdrops coming into the holders. And that was because of the community and the brand that we cultivated. You know, if we own that ecosystem and people are incubating projects, there, maybe there's a flywheel that we can create. So I think it's more, you know, in line with the plan that we've been kind of executing on for the last two and a half years, which is, you know, one pushing crypto forward to mass and benefiting our holders and rewarding them in every way that we can. It seems like both of you guys are playing this playbook where you guys started from NFT collections and now you're both building different types of tools, businesses. You've built a lot of things too. Is that just what it's going to have to be for NFT projects that they all have to become like utility projects? Do we think that NFT projects can actually just exist purely as social clubs or is that bound to go to zero? I think they can totally exist just as social clubs.
06:40:47.685 - 06:41:05.533, Speaker A: But I think that also, you know, comes down to the ambition of the founders. I mean, there's, you know, social clubs naturally, you know, have a ceiling as to where they scale. I'm in the business of trying to win. I'm trying. I want to be, you know, one of the most important people in crypto. And whether that happens or not is up to how well we execute. But that's just not going to happen.
06:41:05.533 - 06:42:15.619, Speaker A: Doing one thing, I think it's about building an empire and an ecosystem, right? We talk about ecosystem systems all the time. And with NFT specifically, there's an elephant in the room. You issue more NFTs, it's the beginning of the end, right? So this idea that you constantly mint new collections to grow the pie, ultimately you fragment liquidity. NFTs naturally don't have that much liquidity. So fragmenting liquidity leads to is kind of a means to an end. So if issuing new NFTs is not in my roadmap and not in my playbook, because we've seen that a thousand times and we know that every time, you know, a project find success and mints new NFTs and goes down that rabbit hole, it leads to a disaster, right? How am I going to grow my ecosystem? How am I going to grow my army? You know, pudgy penguins has 8,888 big pudgies, 2,000 or 22,000, 222 little pudgies and some pretty notorious fishing rods, but that's about 40,000 assets in our ecosystem. I want to build an army that has millions of people, right? So at some point, I think the how NFT succeed versus, you know, and the actual fundamentals and economics behind the success of NFTs is I think you have to keep the NFT ecosystem as kind of this first edition, as this premier, you know, access and the status symbol within this giant ecosystem.
06:42:15.619 - 06:43:01.527, Speaker A: But what is a status symbol where only 100,000 or 200,000 people know what that status yields? I want to build an ecosystem where millions of people are a part of my ecosystem. But the creme de la creme, the early believers, the people who were there in the beginning, are wearing these first editions that are this premium, you know, to this ecosystem and kind of identify you as such. So that's kind of how I look at it. You have to grow the pie. But growing the pie by issuing new NFTs, we've seen it a trillion times, it doesn't work. So at some point, I think if you have big ambitions and you're building an NFT project, I think it's the best way to cultivate a core unit and then ultimately you expand. And as long as those things that you use to expand the ecosystem benefit that core unit, they will continue to rally behind you and continue to galvanize the mission.
06:43:01.527 - 06:43:41.273, Speaker A: Got it. So what would you guys say to anyone who wants to create an NFT collection? Like a founder who wants to create an NFT collection? Why do they need to actually create an NFT collection? My opinion is that I think there's no better place and no better way to create community. I mean, ultimately it starts. Communities can exist from meme coins. They can exist from all sorts of things, but it's the identification layer, right? Meme coins. There isn't this like centralized or there isn't this profile picture in which you can easily identify on the Internet, somebody that, you know, shares those values. And it's almost like a chain reaction effect that I think only NFTs can kind of create.
06:43:41.273 - 06:44:04.411, Speaker A: And there's also some sort of symbolism that I think they create that I think Meme coins just naturally can't replicate. There's something unique about me having Penguin 6445 and Frank having D God 114. There's something symbolic about that. There's something cool about that. There's something that's clicky about that. Not everybody can be a part of that. So I think there's tiers to community.
06:44:04.411 - 06:44:31.917, Speaker A: I think naturally there's always been hierarchy in the world. That's why I think social. Sorry for all the socialists in the crowd, but that's why I think socialism doesn't work, because this idea of everyone is at the same spot doesn't really necessarily work. It never really has. So I think naturally NFTs are the best way to create community. And that's why I would start there. You know, I want to tell you, I want to say, like, the poetic thing to say would be like, yeah, go start one.
06:44:31.917 - 06:45:00.347, Speaker A: But I think our industry doesn't enjoy. Enjoy rewarding people that go against the grain. So to your question, like, if I'm being realistic, should you start an NFT project right now? Probably not, right? Like you get roasted for doing something new in this space, which I think is a bigger problem. But it's, it's one of those things where if you're gonna do it, have like a fresh take, fingers crossed, like, you know, you catch a bid or whatever, or you're probably gonna get shit on. I'm not gonna lie. That's my, that's the real take, honestly. Probably don't do it like.
06:45:00.347 - 06:45:36.585, Speaker A: So the infrastructure surrounding NFTs has only enabled like the use case of PFPs to succeed. And PFPs are inherently like these assets that are built on this concept of scarcity. So how do you actually get into a state of like many, many, many NFTs or millions of NFTs when, like, the whole point of NFTs is that there aren't a lot of them? Like, how can you actually set that market up for success? Yeah, I think you have to look at it as like additions. Right. Again, that's dilution. Right? Like you have more and more NFT collections. You're not necessarily.
06:45:36.585 - 06:46:06.047, Speaker A: That's like saying a regular Pokemon pack, you know, every time it sells dilutes the first edition Charizard. I would argue it actually helps the first edition Charizard. It's this idea that everyone like fudded us when we went to Walmart. Aren't you diluting the brand by going into Walmart? No, I'm getting more people to have affinity and love for the brand. I'm getting more people in that's creating a premium on the things, on the one that creates the most value and has the most value. This idea that these smaller denominations of these things that you use to grow the ecosystem dilutes the ecosystem is such a farce. It's like the worst thing that anyone's ever said.
06:46:06.047 - 06:46:35.393, Speaker A: And it's like I've battled this for like the last two years. It actually is the complete opposite and look no further than just traditional brands and traditional collectibles and how that values accrued. So I take the complete opposite stance. I think, you know, it comes down to status and what this thing represents. Ultimately, if you want your NFT180 to be worth a million dollars is because there's endless demand through millions or tens of millions of people who put that value on that product. And that only goes by. That only happens through distribution and awareness.
06:46:35.393 - 06:47:01.745, Speaker A: So basically you're saying, but that hasn't happened, right? Like there has been no NFT collection that has introduced multiple collections and then those like subsequent when collections become more valuable. But I'm not saying collections, you can do it like through tokens. I think that's where you kind of pointed out to him. I don't think it's necessary. Again, collections I think is the elephant in the room where you can't do it. But again, D God token is a perfect example of that. That's the exact way on how you grow the ecosystem so that you make a premium on the nft.
06:47:01.745 - 06:47:45.685, Speaker A: That's like the perfect way to do it. I think NFTs again, because you're kind of confusing people around, not making a clear delineation between the different collections. I think ultimately that's the problem. But I think from the, from a token perspective or from a product or an awareness perspective, right, you know, Pudgy Penguin Toys being an example, I think those things are all net positive towards awareness, right? If he has a million holders who hold D God token and there's only 20,000, you know, D God NFTs, ultimately those million people are putting a premium on those 20,000 NFT because they know the value of that. They want that identity. They want to be, you know, the, the word I want to say is not appropriate, but like the top dog in the room. And then they want those you know 20,000 NFTs.
06:47:45.685 - 06:48:14.031, Speaker A: So, you know, if and when. Because I believe in Frank and everything that he does. When he gets a million holders and d guides, those NFTs will be worth exponentially more than what they're worth today. Not because they're tied through some bonding curve and whatever clever things he's figured out, but because of the. And that probably will help, obviously, but I think because of the premium that everyone will. That's a million people who recognize and love and know the brand that then want to have that elite status symbol within the community. Has the D Got token made more people buy D got NFTs? I mean, yeah, technically, but I think it's.
06:48:14.031 - 06:48:22.191, Speaker A: It's hard, honestly. I don't know. I'm still doing the data. We gotta, like. Yeah, let it settle. Let us settle. All right, we have less than a minute left.
06:48:22.191 - 06:48:52.657, Speaker A: Maybe predictions for the future of NFT. What are NFTs going to look like in a year? I can go. I think there's this notion that NFTs have been dead and obviously I think the technical metrics are indicative of that. But I think if you look at the top NFT collections, they've never been executing harder. I mean, the execution across the board is incredibly impressive. And I think what NFTs are doing for the entire crypto space is not to be underestimated. And if you're just a trader and somebody who just looks at the opportunity.
06:48:52.657 - 06:49:23.259, Speaker A: It's been two and a half years since NFTs took the downturn. I mean, basically the day we bought Pudgy was the day NFT started going down. And crypto is secular. So these things that come back around every three or four years and we saw that big run up when all the coins and everything was running up with it. I think that's when pudgy penguins kind of, you know, had its big moment. And I think it's one of those things that, you know, when the NFT cycle comes back, when you look at the infrastructure that's in place, they'll be back bigger and better than ever. And I think you'll see multiple NFT projects go where no other NFT has gone before.
06:49:23.259 - 06:50:31.955, Speaker A: All right, I have an answer. Future NFTs on Salana. Let's go. All right, thank you so much. We're out of time. Take care. All right, thank you so much to Luca, Frank and Tiff for an epic last panel of the day.
06:50:31.955 - 06:51:21.405, Speaker A: A lot has been going on for the Solana ecosystem in the last year since we last met in Amsterdam. For Breakpoint. That being said, while a lot has been accomplished, the road ahead for Solana and all of its participants is most certainly long and ambitious. So now give a round of applause and welcome out Mert Mumtaz from Helios for the conversation we've all been waiting for. A fireside chat on the future of Sal Solana with none other than Anatoly Yakovenko. All right. Hello, manlets.
06:51:21.405 - 06:51:59.813, Speaker A: So today we have an exciting talk for you. We're going to talk about something we've never talked about before. Solana and I have some spicy questions for Toly, but I thought we'd maybe start a little serious first and on a lighter note. So my first question tolle is going to be, when are you shaving your head? Thought about it, like, I have three kids now, and with every kid, I have less and less hair on my head. So it's inevitable. Maybe, maybe next break point, I'll have a nice shiny head. All right, you heard it here first.
06:51:59.813 - 06:52:51.279, Speaker A: Anyone there? You know what I'm talking about? Okay, well, so one thing that I think impresses everybody about you is you've helped build one of the best blockchains that exist, the best blockchain existence. And you're still kind of in the trenches every single day. You've basically already kind of made it, but you're still here kind of everyday reply guy ing the most obscure accounts on Twitter and dinosaurs and stuff like that. What's driving you still? Why are you still here? That's a good question. I don't know. I think like a lot of founders or entrepreneurs or, you know, like, you kind of have that, like, demon in you to go do stuff. That dog.
06:52:51.279 - 06:53:22.205, Speaker A: You can't sit still. It's a curse, right? Because you're like, you cannot be happy in the moment. And that's basically, that's probably what I struggle with the most. It's easy to work, easy to look at and like, find problems and then go put your energy in fixing them. And it's much harder to have that presence and be happy. That's, I think, the hard part of the entrepreneurial human existence. But it's rewarding.
06:53:22.205 - 06:54:01.865, Speaker A: It's awesome to see the founders, the builders, everyone that's pushing the network forward. And I don't know what else I'd be doing. It's like I want to have this idea of this, like, science fiction world computer where state and information is synchronized at the speed of light come to fruition and I want to accelerate that as fast as I can. Yeah, So I want to actually talk about that a bit later. But you're actually not standing still or sitting still. You're actually building award winning phones. Solana Mobile last year did win the best phone of the worst phone of the year award by Marcus Brownlee, I think.
06:54:01.865 - 06:54:43.071, Speaker A: And you were like, nope, you know what, we're just going to build another one. And I think you made an announcement two days ago, maybe with the new secret phone. Can you talk a bit about why this one's different, what you're excited about with the new phone? Yeah. So as folks know, I spend most of my career Qualcomm. I was one of the early kernel engineers on this mobile platform called Brew. This is the first flip phones with just trying to get developers to go build something, anything on mobile platforms. So I was there before we had Android, before we had browsing, and then when the iPhone came out, it was this big revolutionary moment.
06:54:43.071 - 06:55:50.455, Speaker A: I was one of the early folks trying to boot up Android and get that going to, to get like a reasonable competitor out to the iPhone. Mobile is one of those things that is I think the epitome of that personal computer of the 80s that dream of having the tricorder in Star Trek. It is the most important device and I think somebody needs, needs to push a crypto version of it because unfortunately, even though we got Linux on the Linux one, right, there's more Android devices out there than Windows devices and probably iPhone devices too. It is a very closed ecosystem. Google kind of sets the standards and censors applications and decides what is okay and what is not. They also charge a massive fee, 20% on Google and 30% on Apple. And it's when people talk about crypto disrupting stuff and they think, oh, we're going to disrupt Visa.
06:55:50.455 - 06:56:25.785, Speaker A: Visa's revenue on top of their gross payment volume is like 10 basis points. That is a sliver of a sliver. And like Apple and Google is 30%, that's 3,000 basis points. That is such a massive difference and such a huge opportunity to disrupt that it feels like somebody should be doing it. And I happened to have the skill set and I felt like we could go and try and make it work. And we shipped a device and we got Marquise to review it. So we got to notice the second one.
06:56:25.785 - 06:56:47.541, Speaker A: You got to review the second one? Just the first. I mean that was surprised to me that he even took a look at it. Okay. And even though he gave us a bust of the year award. So it was a bad device. Right? Like you can think of it oh man, the saga was not the best phone out there. It's still sold out.
06:56:47.541 - 06:57:23.337, Speaker A: Which if you're a startup founder, that is actually a very, very positive signal. When you build a product as a startup founder, you have to take shortcuts. You have to build it as fast as you can to prove out a thesis and you're kind of painting an impressionist painting and you only focus on one really, really important detail and everything else is sloppy. Right? And like when it works, nobody notice the sloppiness. Even if somebody can paint out. Oh man, those like hands are not really hands, right? Like nobody cares about those details. What they care about is the one thing you got right.
06:57:23.337 - 06:58:06.027, Speaker A: And I think the thesis that developers can give out content and get people to switch devices or switch platforms we might have gotten. Right. So there's a like the thing with bonk that happened that was weird and interesting is that people sold the bonk that they had and bought the phone to get the bonk back. So they, they weren't like arbitrary charging the price of the phone. They just saw an opportunity to take this digital assets that NFTs and all this other stuff that are part of these ecosystems. It's really no different than like Fortnite skins or anything else that people attribute value to in the digital world. They just happen to be tradable.
06:58:06.027 - 06:58:39.557, Speaker A: They were able to go do this and use digital content to go switch platforms. That part worked. And it could work at 200,000 units. We're at like 140,000, so I'm pretty sure we'll get there. It could work at a million units. And at that point I think that is a large enough platform with a large enough user base that it is actually competitive with Apple and Google. So like it is like a very, very hard problem to disrupt these big companies.
06:58:39.557 - 06:58:58.849, Speaker A: So how are you going to do it? What are the. Give me a very quick bullet, rapid fire of the new features that you think are worthwhile for everybody who maybe want to look at the phone. It's cheaper. That's the most important part. So it's a $500 device instead of $1,000 device. It's crazy to launch $1,000 device. That's just.
06:58:58.849 - 06:59:41.561, Speaker A: But that was impressive with 20,000 units. It's impossible to build hardware at that like unit cost to actually get it over the hump. So that was part of the trade offs. It's much cheaper, it has really good specs, awesome screen, it's lighter. The software, we have more time to iterate. So the Actual integration with Soulflare, who's doing, like, really, really, really, like, design work to make sure that that experience of signing is like Apple Pay. So a lot of improvements there and hopefully a lot more apps, a lot more things for people to do, and, like, a lot more rewards and everything else to incentivize users to actually stay in a device and use it.
06:59:41.561 - 07:00:09.011, Speaker A: Cool. Well, congrats on the launch. Let's see if that's enough to overcome the disgust people get from seeing green messages on their phones. Green bubbles or something. I don't have an iPhone. Okay, let's switch gears. I tweeted today about what I should ask you, and I got a lot of troll answers, but probably the most troll one was like, ask him what he thinks about his blockchain being used for some weird stuff.
07:00:09.011 - 07:00:46.403, Speaker A: I'm paraphrasing weird here. It was actually quite specific. What do you kind of think about what's being done on maybe blockchains in general, but also Solana. Yeah. There's this weird dynamic with the Internet and a lot of technologies that you have these weird use cases that actually push the technology forward. And even today, you look at iOS, some of the coolest applications that you think what makes Apple and mobile magic is that I can push a button and a car will appear magically in front of me anywhere in the world when I push this button for Lyft or Uber or whatever. But.
07:00:46.403 - 07:02:00.403, Speaker A: But Apple makes almost $0 in revenue from that. They actually make a ton of revenue from games, fart apps like Clash of Clans, like people, you know, spending money to go kill all their friends in their servers. That activity, you don't think of it as, like, why do we need the best designers in the world at a $3 trillion company and at TSMC with 2 nanometer technology to go build a game where you like, playing Tower of Defense or whatever it is that you're doing, but that's what people spend their time on. So you kind of get these weird effects in tech where some of the stuff you build and some of the stuff that generates the most revenue ends up being effectively time filler for a lot of people. But that pays for the really, really cool infrastructure. Like, you look at the Fire Dancer demos, a million tps, and a private, like, globally distributed fiber optic network with FPGA switches that are like, the best technology, like you can even dream of in networking is used for Meme coins. Is that okay? Yes, it is okay.
07:02:00.403 - 07:02:59.075, Speaker A: It's okay for that stuff to pay for this tech. So then you could have a global payment system that is no fees, that is frictional, that is global and truly borderless and makes the rest of commerce move much, much faster and cheaper. So to me, it's a sign that I think we are living in a really, really blessed timeline where people can spend their money and time on playing games while we can build all this technology to improve commerce and make sure we live in a, in a world of abundance for everybody who didn't. I'm guessing everybody watched Kevin Bowers talk, but totally just mentioned something that I think probably most people didn't understand because Kevin Bowers is super intimidating. But the Fire Dancer team, and correct me if I'm wrong, did 1 million TPS on a network of 100 nodes. Correct. Which is pretty insane, right? And so globally distributed.
07:02:59.075 - 07:03:55.695, Speaker A: So these are nodes all over the world? Yeah, all over the world. So with like network jitter and all this. And so maybe that brings me to the next question, which is you always talked about, you know, blockchain or NASDAQ at blockchain? No, blockchain at NASDAQ speeds. See, it's very confusing. Get rid of it and the global state machine and it's what drives you and stuff. And one of my critiques to that has been like, why do you think people care that it's a global state machine? Like, is that actually the thing that people have a use for? Or do you just think it's cool and you want to like, you know, build it? So like, what does that actually mean? And why do you think it's important? The kind of time is money, right? Is the most apparent in trading and finance and execution. So when an order is delayed, when the queue to get the orders has like attack vectors and mav extraction and all these things, these are all like sand in the gears of finance.
07:03:55.695 - 07:05:04.509, Speaker A: And that means that people have to price their things higher than they should be because of all these little like things that extract value or collect rents from information. So that causes prices to be worse for people. And that exists with any kind of system that introduces delays or settlement risk or anything else. So if you want to think about how do we disrupt, like, what is the final stage of all of finance? In my view, it is a single giant global state machine that is moving as fast as speed, alight as physics aligned, that is atomic and permissionless and global. And there's the cool thing, is that this can be built on hardware that is available to anyone in the world with open source software by volunteers effectively kind of running these boxes and stuff. And that's a very, very disruptive idea in my mind. It is as disruptive as Linux was in the 90s where you had these proprietary commercial operating systems that were very expensive to build.
07:05:04.509 - 07:05:49.479, Speaker A: That took, you know, 100,000 engineers at Microsoft and these hobbyists were like, you know what? We can do better by just sharing code freely amongst each other on the weekends. And they won. And I think the reason that crypto will win is because it can build a better product. It can be a very, very fast, giant atomic state machine that allows anyone to participate dissipate at the speed of light. And that's going to be result in better pricing for people, better prices are going to win customers. That's what it comes down to. What's the biggest misconception about Solana? I don't know.
07:05:49.479 - 07:06:26.605, Speaker A: I mean, I've been replying to all of these for so long. Why do you do that? Why do you go on Twitter? I never go on Twitter. It sucks. I again, like when I moved as a kid from the ussr, literally, if anyone remembers what that was to United States as the Internet, like consumer Internet was just starting to get going. It was just such a bizarre change. And I was plugged in on the Internet in like IRC chat rooms and ICQ and stuff. And I just kind of got used to this idea of being permanently connected.
07:06:26.605 - 07:06:45.691, Speaker A: So it's part of that demon, right, that like you can't, you can't stop. Right. You're always trying to fix something, always trying to talk to people. So I don't know. Yeah. So you're saying basically, like it's a curse. These new founders have merely adopted the troll, but you were born in it.
07:06:45.691 - 07:07:22.213, Speaker A: I was born in it, yeah. Cool. Well, I mean, let's shift gears again. What keeps you up at night? The scariest thing in these systems is that they're built by people and people write bugs and sometimes those bugs can be catastrophic. So that's been the most frightening thing about working in the space is that, you know, smart contract hacks, but these could happen at the L1 infra itself. And that's the scariest thing. And this is why Fire Dancer has been such a big focus in the ecosystem.
07:07:22.213 - 07:07:56.601, Speaker A: It's just having a second implementation of the same protocol, regardless of the TPS and all this stuff. It's awesome that we were able to give them two goals. One is build a rebuild it, but also show us how we suck at software and make it faster. They are able to accomplish both of those, but the most important part there isn't the performance, it's literally that it's built by different people. So the probability of the same bug occurring in both implementations is very, very unlikely. And the third client is much, much easier when you have two. So that's the scariest part.
07:07:56.601 - 07:08:37.745, Speaker A: That's what keeps me up at night. But we're getting very close to the that being kind of done and an issue behind us. And as soon as Fire Dancer is on mainnet to a level where more than 33% of the network is either running Fire Dancer or both clients, in my view, that's not beta anymore. I will take the beta tag off the explorer that runs that Labs runs. That name is so troll. What do you. As Fire Dancer continues to work on this and maybe third and fourth validators spin up or clients spin up and more and more people build things.
07:08:37.745 - 07:09:16.107, Speaker A: What do you envision your role evolving into? Five years into the future, six years into the future. What do you want to be doing? I love the principal engineer track. I see. It's great. Like, I love talking to the super smart folks at Anza, at Fire Dancer with like a proposal, like a sync execution and having forcing them to go look at it. I have the I'm privileged that they will listen to me, they will hear me out and they won't listen to me and do exactly what I said. They will fight back and we end up with a better result, better design.
07:09:16.107 - 07:09:50.979, Speaker A: So I mean, if I could be doing that 10, 20 years from now, I'm blessed. Like, it means like I get very lucky and Solana keeps improving and there's more design work and I get to do the stuff that brought me into engineering in the first place. Cool. Yeah. Shout out to Trent for taking away Tolle's GitHub privileges. One thing I also want to ask is you're super into startups and kind of the founder mentality or having a demon or dog in you. A lot of people look up to you.
07:09:50.979 - 07:10:52.359, Speaker A: Obviously we were just outside and everybody wants to take a picture with you and whatnot. What would you like to see more from the Solana ecosystem? What are some words of encouragement that you'd offer them? Go build weird stuff. Like I think like as soon as I like landed in the US right as a kid, parents got me a computer, was a Pentium 75. I was trying to figure out Linux and really got into computers and like was a nerd and loved software and the movie hackers just still like burn into my brain and the idea and the dream of Silicon Valley where You can start with an idea and go build it in your garage. That was really, really exciting. And I think that idea is now global. And crypto and the finance that crypto creates that's global and borderless has really demonstrated that you don't need Silicon Valley, you don't even need Wall Street.
07:10:52.359 - 07:11:28.059, Speaker A: Everything can happen on the Internet in our own little kind of like our own world, and it's awesome. And you just need founders that are, like, working on weird stuff on the weekend, and some of it will pop that. Some of it will actually take off and become really valuable and improve people's lives. So just go build stuff. The worst thing you can do is nothing. It's a lot of advice and a lot of startup advice in Paul Graham's notes and Silicon Valley books. And a startup or the founder needs to like, is like a shark.
07:11:28.059 - 07:11:48.655, Speaker A: They need to be swimming, they need to be trying things. Even if you build the wrong thing, it's a learning process. And the iteration of trying to get product, market, fit and get users and understanding them, it's all part of the learning process. So just go build stuff. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about failure. Just, like, go do it.
07:11:48.655 - 07:12:05.965, Speaker A: Cool. Final question. Not sure if you've ever been asked this. You are famous for having two coffees and a beer. What was the beer? It was a Kolsch. A Kolsch? I don't remember the brand. It was a Kolsch.
07:12:05.965 - 07:12:27.831, Speaker A: Well, I was in San Diego for about a decade, and it was like, IPAs everywhere. And after you just get sick of IPAs at some point. I don't know. Yeah. And like, I switched to the cleanest, crispest beer you can get at that time was a Kolsch. Yeah. So if you guys want to come up with any new breakthroughs.
07:12:27.831 - 07:13:00.537, Speaker A: Two cappuccinos and a Kolsch. And cappuccino specifically. Yeah. Okay, cool. Well, that's all the time we got. Please give a huge round of applause to the legend Anatoli. Thank you so much to Mert and Tolle for taking the time.
07:13:00.537 - 07:13:52.607, Speaker A: I'm sure I can speak to everyone, for everyone in the audience when I say that I'm incredibly excited for everything to come, for this ecosystem and that we're just getting started. Started. If you're in the audience, you're going to want to stay in your seats. Give us a moment here to turn over the stage. We have an incredible musical tree as well as a product update from the team at Jambo. It's something that you're not going to want to miss, so be sure to stick around. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Sam.
07:13:52.607 - 07:17:02.375, Speaker A: I am the employee number one at a company called Jambo, the most globally distributed web3mobile. Our motto is to empower, inspire, live. In light of that, I'm here to showcase something a little bit special. Hope you guys enjoy sa. Hey, y'all. Thought we were gonna just show you guys a little violin and a beat pop boxing showcase. You were wrong.
07:17:02.375 - 07:17:19.575, Speaker A: Hey, shout out to Lily from Salana Foundation. When I say, is that true? You say, okie dokie yo Is that true? Yes. Okie dokie yo Is that true? Yes. Okie dokie yo. Drum. Milo. Yes.
07:17:19.575 - 07:18:20.599, Speaker A: Okie dokie yo say la da. La da, la da, la da, la da. You guys having a good time? Make some noise. Hands up. Hands up. Give us some jumbo phones. In the next verse.
07:18:20.599 - 07:18:41.355, Speaker A: Sing along and you might just get one. You hear me? Yeah. Okie dokie yo Is that true? Yes. Okie dokie yo Is that you? Yes. Okie dokie yo Jama. Yes. Okie dokie yo say la da la da la da la da Lo.
07:18:41.355 - 07:19:51.939, Speaker A: Another one. Where you at? Stick with me. Yeah. Okie dokie yo Is that true? Yes. Okie dokie yo Is that true? Yes. Okie dokie yo Jamalo. Yes.
07:19:51.939 - 07:20:08.773, Speaker A: Okie dokie yo say la da. La da, La da la da. Lada. I see you, boy. Let's get it. Make some noise. See you.
07:20:08.773 - 07:20:31.995, Speaker A: Let's get it. I can't hear you. I stole. Phones up. Hands up. And now we going up one handing. Okey dokey yo Is that true? Yes.
07:20:31.995 - 07:21:10.405, Speaker A: Is that true? Yes. Okie dokie yo. Jack. Milo. Yes. Okie dokie yo Say, ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for co founder and CE CEO James Zay. What's up, Solana fam? Are you not entertained? How's everyone doing today? I'm James, the co founder and CEO of Jambo.
07:21:10.405 - 07:21:40.855, Speaker A: So I told my team, I know most of y'all are either jet lag or you're trying to go to F1. So I hope we got your attention real quick for five minutes. Jumbo is the most distributed web3 mobile or emerging markets and in the entire world. We started shipping. Since January of this year, we've done 500,000 phones, created over 2 million wallets in 128 countries. Appreciate y'all. Now I see a lot of familiar faces in the crowd.
07:21:40.855 - 07:22:07.149, Speaker A: My name is James, but for those that don't know me, I'm ethnically Chinese. I grew up in Africa, 16 years of my life. And that is where our supply chain is in China. And the reason we started Jambo is for three reasons. When you grow up in a country like Congo, you have things like cross border payments, remittances, banking, the unbanked. You cannot access your friends very close to you. Even so that is what we are here to do.
07:22:07.149 - 07:24:51.847, Speaker A: We want to bridge that gap using Web3 mobile technology. So honestly, we want to give a big shout out to the entire Solana fam for having us here and you guys for supporting us. Now I know you guys have been here in all kinds of talks all day, so I'm going to just keep it short for you. And please allow me to show you how we got here today. Thank you. Who makes the loudest noise? Who yet? Awesome. Oh, y'all thought that was over? Nah, you got a little more seconds of me right here.
07:24:51.847 - 07:25:43.985, Speaker A: It is my absolute honor to present the Jambo V2 here at Solana Breakpoint 2024. The Jambo V2 $99 exact same price for double the specs, shipping to 128 countries and including one of the most important features, Jumbo GPT. As you know, ChatGPT and OpenAI has changed all of our lives. But a lot of places in emerging markets, for example our largest market, Sao Paulo, Brazil, Argentina, Thailand, et cetera, you might not have access to as a 19 year old kid there. So now through Jumbo GPT you can access it through crypto and live directly direct your wallet. Your Jumbo wallet pre installed the phone to do certain actions through it.

07:25:43.985 - 07:26:19.627, Speaker A: We have a QR code over here. Not to do a cliche, but right now if you scan this code and you order it, you will have the Jumbo GPT and the Jumbo V2 at your home within two months. Last part. It is our absolute honor, absolute honor to share with you because you're not here to hear me talk for the entire time. You're here to know exactly how this pertains to you. Our largest partner at the moment for integrating into the phone that might have something to do with your wallet balance, Mr. Bonk.
07:26:19.627 - 07:27:03.559, Speaker A: We will be having some drops of air of the bonk into our phone within the next few months. So please last but not least, shout out to everyone here, Lily, Toli, everyone on stage, Ellie, that got us over here. We are absolutely proud and thank you for supporting us even till right now. Love y'all. Cheers. Wow. Thank you so much.
07:27:03.559 - 07:27:30.405, Speaker A: To the Jumbo team for that. Never can say. Can say that I've never seen a presentation or stage presence or musical showing like that at a crypto conference before at what is what I would consider one of the best events in the industry. Quite consistently so. Wrapping up the the formal programming for day one, let's give a final round of applause for all of today's speakers, the sponsors to make this possible and the team behind this incredible event.
