00:00:01.920 - 00:00:49.896, Speaker A: Alrighty and I think we are live. Welcome everyone to the first event of the Solana Wormhole hackathon. Today we have Sam Bankman, Free, CEO, co founder of Alameda Research and FTX. And we have Anatoly Yankovnko, CEO, co founder of Solana. And today we're going to be doing 35 45 minutes fireside chat where the two of them are going to just take a deep dive into wormhole useful applications and anything else that they tend to get into when they chat. In the chat section you can see a link for the Solana Hackathon website where you can get more information. Registration is open until the 27th and hacking will commence from the 28th until the 14 November.
00:00:49.896 - 00:01:08.182, Speaker A: We have a couple of useful links for information where you can learn more about the code base and if you are an independent applicant, we have a discord chat where you can get connected with other folks looking to build a team. I think with that I'm going to jump off stage and tolly, I'll let you take it away.
00:01:08.358 - 00:01:23.058, Speaker B: Enjoy them. Hey folks, really good to be here. So Sam, do you want to. I guess, do you need an introduction? The man that doesn't need an introduction.
00:01:23.226 - 00:02:04.830, Speaker C: You know, I'm Sam, I'm, you know, CEO of FTX and I've been spearheading project serum and I really excited, you know, really excited to be kicking off the wormhole hackathon and I don't know, I mean, I think that this is. I think by some definitions we might be about to start at least a relative defi winter. I mean, I don't think it's going to be exactly like frosted over, but. But certainly compared to what we saw two months ago. But I'm sort of almost excited for it. I don't know, I mean, it's not. I mean, I've always likes when prices are going up.
00:02:04.830 - 00:02:29.054, Speaker C: I prefer that too. But it does sort of feel like. Like not so much of winter that no one gives a fucking, but maybe enough of a winter that they're sort of like more focus on building and more focus on useful products and stuff and less on. I heard there's a new ERC 20 token today. Did you?
00:02:31.114 - 00:03:06.564, Speaker B: Yeah. I think what's interesting from a market perspective is that the expansion drives new teams to come and join the space and then build. Usually that expansion goes a little too far, too fast, but at some point I think we're going to get a continuous set of impulses in the space where it never feels like there is a winter, which I think is almost true today because bitcoin is going up like crazy, but there's no veggie tokens to bet your money on.
00:03:07.424 - 00:03:41.214, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting, actually. Like, in. I don't know, I sort of. Okay, I spoke to make evacuous statement, stupid. Like, I wish I knew when bitcoin was going to go up and why, but I wish I knew more for sure what was going on now, because I think there's some interpretations of what's going on right now for today. Answer is like, yeah, I mean, how many times have you heard that the institutions are coming? Like, I think, like once a month, maybe for the last ten years. Sort of like, Goldman Sachs is always just about to jump in, according to crypto, Twitter.
00:03:41.214 - 00:04:07.840, Speaker C: But I don't know, this sort of feels like at least institutions came, you know, a few of them at least. And maybe that was, that was some of this. And maybe in size, you know, I think, like, maybe a few billion dollars worth over the last month. I mean, I don't know for sure, but you, like, I don't probably wait. The various rumors you hear and, like, sort of feels like. Like, you know, maybe micro striding. Yeah, it actually was.
00:04:07.840 - 00:04:23.444, Speaker C: Was just the appetizer here. I've been pretty cool, you know, if, like, um, if the floodgates were actually, I don't know, floodgates are opening, but maybe, like, you know, a panel fell down on them at least, and, like, there is a little bit of a faucet.
00:04:24.344 - 00:04:45.558, Speaker B: So, um, let's kind of get a bit more back to the topic at hand. Yeah, yeah. I mean, but this is all very tied together. Like, I think I, you know, I've. I've always kind of saw blockchain as an implementation of an exchange. Like a really cool one. Right.
00:04:45.558 - 00:05:23.364, Speaker B: Like, but at the end of the day, I feel like these systems are custodians, even if it's something as decentralized as bitcoin or ethereum. You have machines that are not you, not your brain. Right. That are custody of things, and you have cryptography that kind of protects that state. So bridging these systems, I think, is like a way for us to almost implement connections between exchanges that aren't based on a business. Kind of like negotiation between FTX and finance to allow transfers between the two. Right.
00:05:23.364 - 00:05:39.124, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're. That's like the boring world, right. And I think, like, the bridges that we're building, like wormhole, are. This total automatic implementation. Allows us stuff to happen without any paper.
00:05:40.464 - 00:05:54.724, Speaker C: Yeah. And it's interesting like, I don't know what the end state is here. Like, it's, you know, the fewer bridges, the better. Obviously not. The fewer bridges you have. The more bridges you have, the better. The fewer bridges you need, the better.
00:05:54.724 - 00:07:01.408, Speaker C: But where does this all end up? I don't know exactly, but it's certainly, like, every step that you can make here helps, every step that you can reduce intermediaries that you can. And I think that when people think about this, I don't know what other people think about. I think other people sort of probably think about, like, are they about to run away with the money or something? I actually like, I mean, that's certainly a thing. One thing that I think about definitely is, like, march 12. Like, whenever sort of you talk about the need for abridging in a place, like, the first thing that comes to my mind is, so it's March 12, and bitcoin just fell from 8000 to 4000 in the course of, like, 12 hours. And now you want to do something. Does it work? And I think the reason is that there's a lot of things that usually you use them and they just work, and you can't even tell the difference between different systems.
00:07:01.408 - 00:07:48.538, Speaker C: It's sort of just like, yeah, everything works. Withdrawals from centralized exchanges just work. And then you're like, okay, but what about when you really need them? What about when everyone needs them and everything is fucked? Like, what about when every part of the system is massively strained? How fail proof is something in theory? One really nice thing about Defi is it's still there. And I think for something to really be defi in some sense, that's almost a test. I hold it up to. It's like on March 12, when everything is going to shit and everything is stretched extremely thin, and anything that could shut down is starting to shut down. Not even intentionally, just because, like, sometimes people don't have enough hands to not shut something down.
00:07:48.538 - 00:08:29.474, Speaker C: And I can, like, get into what that looks like. But, um, you certainly, having managed an exchange through exchange through March 12, like, boy, was that an experience. Um, you know, like, which things still work then? And I think that, like, that, like, one thing Defi should be aspiring to is that the core things that you need still work on, you know, when everything is crazy. And I think that, like, when you think about bridges, a lot of what I think about is, like, you know, between the various levels of centralization and decentralization is, it's March 12. I need to get your assets from one chain to another, and you want to use this bridge, does it work? And is it like, you know, reasonably prompt?
00:08:30.654 - 00:09:47.864, Speaker B: Yep. And so this, this is like, I think kind of like a key way to analyze these systems is like what happens when, you know, shit hits the fan, so to speak. Can we still like actually trust this? And with a layer one, you kind of get this continuous, you know, massive, like, bounty, right, but bug hunt on a layer one, like if everyone is always trying to hack Ethereum and every other layer one, and these systems kind of become resilient really quickly, you know, or they die, we see massive survivor by a stranger that sticks around is the things that were built, you know, lucky enough to be to made the right choices. So with bridges, I think we'll see something similar. Like, I think like, because these are open and permissionless systems, we're going to start seeing these kinds of effectively long running bug houndies that prove these out and it'll get there. But it's just, to me, always been a matter of time. It's just, do you trust a new bridge or do you trust a bridge that's been running for two years and it's seen some ups and downs through the market cycles?
00:09:47.974 - 00:09:50.812, Speaker C: Yep, yep. No, totally agree.
00:09:50.948 - 00:10:02.864, Speaker B: Yeah, that's also true, I think, about layer ones, obviously, right? No, everyone kind of assumes that Ethereum will just work and us and every other new chain still have a lot of proving ground to do.
00:10:03.924 - 00:10:33.716, Speaker C: But of course it's not, it's only true in some cases. Like, if you're there on March 12, one thing you know is Ethereum didn't work. I mean, it's not that it became centralized, right? It's not that it said fuck you. Well, like, I refuse. It's just like it became so massively outbid that, like, it was taking hours to get things through unless you're paying like, you know, $10,000 per transaction. And so it sort of, it didn't work in the way that matters. And in fact, like, a lot of feedback we got from customers was, you have to stop using ERc 20s like this.
00:10:33.716 - 00:10:54.364, Speaker C: It was actually quite bad for FTX's business that it, that it used ERC Twenty's on March 12. And it was like a swift kick in the asset. We needed to get all of our core tokens on non ethereum chains like ASAP, because the next time, Thursday, March 12, like, customers are not happy if it takes an hour and a half for any deposit or withdrawal.
00:10:54.824 - 00:11:14.464, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's awesome for Solana. Yeah, that's effectively like building a system for a black swan event is. Is hard because these are not, like, things that are tested every day. Right. Nobody ever cares about it until. Until they get screwed.
00:11:14.464 - 00:11:53.712, Speaker B: I think, like, if you think of, like, decentralized, I kind of start to think about bridges as decentralized custody. And really, all of these networks are a form of decentralized custody. Do you think that some of these systems are going to, like. Like, a layer one. Right. Has an advantage because we have fiat ramps to exchanges and other networks through a bridge and to, like, USDT stable coins. Like, it's not, like a simple thing anymore where you only have one exit point back to Ethereum.
00:11:53.712 - 00:12:12.634, Speaker B: Right? So in those black swan events, I imagine that, like, the combination of all of these is what's going to prevent, like, the whole infrastructure from falling over, that a user can go to Ethereum or they can go to FTX or straight to USDT.
00:12:12.794 - 00:12:56.320, Speaker C: It's a good question. And I think that what you have to ask is, where is the liquidity during a black swan? What still works? What still grounds everything? It's definitely different. But I think one thing that I'll mention, and I think one interesting thing is the answer is quite different for USDC versus USDT. And I don't even know that it's hard. It's not easy to answer the question of which is more liquid in normal times or in black swans, necessarily, because they're very differently liquid. And USDC is the world's leader in primary liquidity. What I mean by creation, redemption liquidity.
00:12:56.320 - 00:13:19.776, Speaker C: Um, so, like, its calling card is that even when things are going to shit, you send USDC to a redemption portal. Usually within an hour, you've got funds in a bank account. Um, it's not like, as. I mean, it's sort of, like, in, like, 99% works. Like, I wish it were 100, but it, like, it's. Everything else is, like, 80. So it's.
00:13:19.776 - 00:13:46.086, Speaker C: It's like, really running laps around the pack. There's, in fact, almost every other stable coin. Like, the more you use it, you're sort of like, okay, you know what? This is actually just as good for, like, most days use. But, boy, do I not think on March 12, it's going to be fast to create and redeem. I don't even know why it won't, but it won't. Like, there's just too many rickety steps in the process. Like, there's too many people that have to be awake and on telegram and responsive, and when everything's moving, they've got other things to do.
00:13:46.086 - 00:14:25.928, Speaker C: Like it's going to get stuck between two intermediaries. So that's one thing about, like I think that USDC is great for is like, if you had to say, like, you've got a thing on the blockchain and it needs to be a dollar in your bank account as trust in as fast and trustworthy a way as possible. What do you choose? I choose USDC. And you don't need anything else except on USDC for it. On the circle portal, I'm fudging it a little bit. Like, the Coinbase portal is quite good usually, but it has issues. Things get backed up, so there's still some rough things around the edge, but it's quite good.
00:14:25.928 - 00:14:59.110, Speaker C: On the other hand, it's secondary market liquid is actually not that great. Marks are like, okay, but some within tether is complete opposite. You can create it, you can redeem it, but it's not the easiest thing to. And certainly when everything's going to shit, you should just add a few days onto your expectation. When is the tether team going to have capacity to listen to your redemption request? Not that they don't want to process it, but that, like, they got too many for us all, they're just clicking as fast as they can. So I do not trust that. Sort of like primary liquidity on a fast timescale and things are crushing.
00:14:59.110 - 00:15:15.164, Speaker C: But when it comes to secondary market liquidity, it often has more than USD does. Like it's. It often has more exchange liquidity than actual dollars for that. I think the important thing is being able to get it between wherever you're using it and centralized exchanges.
00:15:16.784 - 00:15:55.378, Speaker B: So bridges have a similar dynamic in the sense that there's a simple way to build one which serum launched with solid, which is a very simple multi seg that connects your c more complicated solution, full spec IPc, where you're running consensus verification of both chains and trade offs there. Like that you have more automated system that's using kind of the foundational part of the code that doesn't require an intermediary versus, but one that is much slower by definition, right?
00:15:55.466 - 00:16:15.224, Speaker C: I mean, slower to build is a big thing. Like, just takes longer to make and it's lower to run. I also think that there's some interplay there. Like, I think that you could cut down, like the sort of things you're sharing now, like days to weeks to go through optimistic roll ups is terrifying. Like that. That doesn't work. That can't be the answer.
00:16:15.224 - 00:16:51.164, Speaker C: I sort of think you can get it down to minutes to an hour. But I also sort of think that's really hard. Like that's the sort of thing where like you have to cut, you have to make the process extremely streamlined and extremely optimistic and really trust all the reward systems work and are not abusable. It's doable, but I think it's like we tried to draft out, it's like a ten page paper just to draft out the specs. And that was without building any single part of it. And I'm sure we even get into what happens if there's a fork.
00:16:51.904 - 00:17:54.170, Speaker B: Yep. So our approach is like actually doing all of these things in parallel because I like shifting code more than disgusting design. So wormhole is like a simple multisig with some caveats that it's a larger set and it's run by this, a lot of validators, which we kind of have. Like, there's interesting parallels there, right? Anytime you move ethereum to another chain, you're depositing into a contract and you're trusting the logic of that contract. Like you're effectively giving this contract your funds and then you're saying whatever logic is executing inside this thing, it really controls who gets to spend. And with a like, client implementation, it is equivalent to transferring those funds to a remote multisig that can create and manufacture those headers at any time. Which is kind of a different way to think about it.
00:17:54.170 - 00:18:45.104, Speaker B: Like, people typically don't visualize these systems as multi six, right? Like they think of consensus as a magical thing that just makes everything decentralized and impenetrable. So, which is, I think, like at the end of the day, probably good and bad, because if all the actors behave correctly, it is equivalent to that. And there's just enough support to prevent bad actors from kind of running away with it that people can trust these systems. Do you think, like, we will ultimately need to have insurance for these for like bridges? Like, do you, like you, do you guys see like institutionals that are coming in that have some ETH that deposit funds into a bridge? Do they want those funds insured?
00:18:45.624 - 00:19:23.264, Speaker C: So I'm going to be honest, I have not been sold on Defi insurance. You might have centralized insurance for it. I'm like, not sold on, on chain insurance. And the reason is it's just so fucking capital inefficient. Like, like the whole thing with insurance is you're trying to protect against a black swan, but that means you have to have the funds to pay out to a black swan sitting there in a contract, sort of by definition is going to be massive payout, low probability, which means in almost all worlds, you have massive amounts of capital sitting there doing fuck all. And so anyway, that's sort of like. But I think centralized insurance pools, I think definitely could happen.
00:19:26.204 - 00:19:53.064, Speaker B: What about, like, the fact that if I deposit, like, the bond into an insurance pool, I get a token back and that's not the same thing as ETH, right? It's now ETH plus the risk of this thing blowing up, but it still has value, so. Yes, which, which then I can plug into markets, right? And then trade and then, and then things become really interesting. If I push that thing through the bridge.
00:19:54.764 - 00:20:48.754, Speaker C: Yeah, you can do it. I think it's. And to be clear, we just did that. It's like, I don't know if you're thinking about that, but if you go to, go to, you know, any of the CRM Dexs right now, I'll post a link in the chat and pull up a market that I'll post a link to as well. You can trade exactly that for Okex, bitcoins. And so you go to any of these Dexes and then you add a custom market and it'll just like, post which market that is for people who are curious here. You can in fact trade an IOU for a bitcoin on Okex, which has had its withdrawal sort of frozen for the last, what, week or two.
00:20:48.754 - 00:21:29.624, Speaker C: And I think that's super interesting and is an example of that. And I think it's a super cool market. I think it's like, you know, super interesting to talk about. I also think, though, that it's, like, not going to be the fundamental thing people are trading. Like, you know, I don't think that people are going to be like, that's going to be what people call a bitcoin is like, you know, I think people want a bitcoin to be a bitcoin and trading at one bitcoin, you know, and I don't think that the insurance bitcoin that's thought of as trading at a real discount, at least if the discount is significant, is going to be the thing, which is going to be the fundamental building block of it, of an ecosystem.
00:21:30.844 - 00:21:47.824, Speaker B: But it is like more transparent, though, right? If I have a centralized insurer and I don't know what they're doing with a capital, the risks are like, somebody bears the risk, right? Usually the users.
00:21:49.444 - 00:22:34.914, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Um, yeah. So, like, um, so I think, like, I agree, it's, I mean, you can ask people, like, would you accept twice as much capital inefficiency in exchange for removing that risk. I don't think people say yes. Like, I, like there's. There's a reason that insurance pools, all right, I mean, they're generally underfunded, among other things. Like, like if you have an insurance pool and you fully fund it and put the dollar sitting there in a bank account for a world in which I, you know, in which everything goes to shit, that's like no one could do it, you know?
00:22:36.974 - 00:22:57.544, Speaker B: Yeah. So what are you. What are you excited about? Bridged assets. Like what? Like, what. What is exciting to you about them? That because they are effectively capital inefficient pegs. Right. I actually have some guarantees that this capital is sitting in the contract.
00:22:57.544 - 00:23:02.164, Speaker B: And ethereum, now you can go use it here and claim ownership of it.
00:23:03.184 - 00:23:25.944, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, first of all, I think they're just super crucial. Like, you know, they're. They're what let you move between venues, between chains. And that's just like really fundamental to these ecosystems. Being able to. To work and especially take off. And, like, the place that I'd want to get to is a place where you don't feel like you have to use a bridge.
00:23:25.944 - 00:24:01.004, Speaker C: Like, I think, like the end goal here is like, it feels like you have an. You know, you have one, Ethan, and you can use it on uniswap, you can use it on serum, whatever. It's not like, now we're going to go do a little dance to turn into the other. Even if that is happening, you sort of want it to feel invisible, but also want to be as trustworthy as possible. And I think it's doable to make a lot of progress there. I think wormholes, a pretty good leap in that direction. I think.
00:24:01.004 - 00:24:18.754, Speaker C: I think. I think especially like, a lot of people feel like it's. I think like the current bridging solutions are all maybe closer together than some people feel like they are. In terms of just around the space, in terms of decentralization.
00:24:20.534 - 00:24:41.936, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure. The way to. I mean, like there's the. I think the challenge is that the fully. The faster path both is faster for the users, which I think is a huge bottleneck right now for adoption. It's just latency. Some of these things are too damn slow.
00:24:41.936 - 00:25:08.664, Speaker B: Solving that, I think is the most important part. Then building out the iterating on the reward games to make sure that these things don't fall apart during a black swan, I think is the second 2nd thing to solve. And that that's just going to take longer in my view, simply because that's a much larger problem, but also, I think, solvable for the most part.
00:25:09.404 - 00:25:11.436, Speaker C: Yep, yep, I agree.
00:25:11.620 - 00:25:20.908, Speaker B: Besides, like, besides actually bridging assets across, you guys see any else that you'd like? What would you like to see?
00:25:20.956 - 00:25:26.594, Speaker C: Like being built just like in general, the ecosystem. Other than bridges.
00:25:28.694 - 00:25:33.118, Speaker B: Or like what? Like integrations that could go through a bridge.
00:25:33.286 - 00:25:34.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean.
00:25:36.694 - 00:25:45.318, Speaker B: At a, like a very simple way, like the programmatic thing of transferring an ERC 20 is really no different than calling a function.
00:25:45.486 - 00:25:45.902, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:45.958 - 00:25:54.818, Speaker B: Right. And then you can kind of do like. Yeah, from like a very, like an. I'm doing an API call on serum. Right. Like not like not actually like transferring your.
00:25:54.866 - 00:26:27.038, Speaker C: Or an ethereum for that matter. Um, yeah, that would be obviously. So, so that's when you start to get, I mean it's really hard, but you do start to regain composability at some point. Like at some point you, you can compose sort of cross chain. Um, you can't do it in one transaction, which is. So you can't do the thing where you block on it where you say, like, I want to do these five things, but only if they all work. But you can have an on chain call, call a function on another chain.
00:26:27.038 - 00:27:19.484, Speaker C: Theoretically, if you have a bridge you trust and that's super powerful, right, then you can start using compound to power margin trading on a serum dex, like ethereum based compound. And I think that's, that's like super fucking awesome. And I think more generally that regains actually a kind of decent amount of composability. Even without that though, like with a tokens and c tokens and lp tokens, you could make a market on serum that gets yield. I think like Stani mentioned this to me most recently, but like find it kind of cool if someone started like a, you know, whatever, you know, an 8th against a USDC market on, on serum, you can do it. It's not hard. Just use solid to bridge and then add a new custom market.
00:27:19.484 - 00:27:31.504, Speaker C: And it's just like a current USDC market except I'm building whatever risk Aave has. But also you get yield for, you know, your open orders on it, which, which I think is pretty cool.
00:27:34.004 - 00:28:01.356, Speaker B: Yeah, that to me is also like really cool. If Ethereum had enough like juice in the vm, you could actually do a full round of consensus of Solana and stuff it in the 15 2nd Ethereum block. So you could do like almost like a synchronous skull, which would be, which would work. So that's doable. The problem is more computational, and we.
00:28:01.380 - 00:28:08.124, Speaker C: Could let you do things on Ethereum that you can't do if you're not doing this nonsense. It doesn't make it faster than before, so.
00:28:08.284 - 00:28:45.004, Speaker B: Right. Yeah, yeah. Well, one cool thing that I've been thinking about is, you know, like, this information that's basically computed in Solana now, like using serum, is really like much more stronger bounds on the security of it than an oracle because you have real market makers that they get position and take risk with that position. So that spread is real. Right. This is information that is like really hard to get to. Like, if you move it, if you use an oracle, you're kind of effectively always, you know, behind the times.
00:28:45.004 - 00:28:53.624, Speaker B: Right. That people can always arb your oracle news itself because there's really no, not enough, like skin in the game.
00:28:54.204 - 00:28:54.588, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:54.636 - 00:28:58.704, Speaker B: That oracle price. Right. Like serum data actually has skin in the game.
00:28:59.664 - 00:29:30.654, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's like surprisingly few people seem to be really. Yeah, I think on chain oracles, like, if your oracle doesn't need to cross chains, first of all, then you don't need this whole multisig stuff, or a lot of it. You can just like fucking look at the dex praise, which is nice. And theoretically, with bridges, you can bridge that across. You know, you can, you can bridge oracles directly, which, um, reduces a lot of the failure, most of them, and, and speeds them up. Yeah.
00:29:31.594 - 00:29:44.138, Speaker B: So, like, I mean, you could potentially kind of get rid of a lot of the, the risk of custody by having this information that's basically computed on serum that being bridged over to ethereum.
00:29:44.226 - 00:29:44.690, Speaker C: Yeah, right.
00:29:44.722 - 00:29:49.274, Speaker B: Like you can move the entire, like, order book info, right. This is the spread and all the prices.
00:29:49.314 - 00:29:49.786, Speaker C: I agree.
00:29:49.890 - 00:29:57.754, Speaker B: And that proof itself could like drive a uniswap market where Ethereum users are not like scared of taking risk. Right.
00:29:59.414 - 00:30:25.024, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. In fact, as you're saying, you could imagine a lot of protocols that are building on Ethereum can almost treat. I mean, this is serves viewing salon as a L2, basically, where you have an ethereum, something that sees itself as an Ethereum based oracle brine to Ethereum based protocols, among other things. But on the backend, it's doing a lot of its computation on Solana. And so it bridges over there, does all the computation it needs, and then bridges back the result.
00:30:26.924 - 00:31:12.494, Speaker B: And that to me is almost like this idea of like, I don't know, I've been tweeting about this, that block space is fungible. It doesn't matter where this stuff is computed. Like we can figure out how to move this data across and it's going to get cheaper because the cryptography is getting better. Like as soon as Ethereum actually ships like BLS twelve, 381 signature aggregation is going to make moving that information over like a thousand times cheaper. It's not going to matter how many Solana validators we have, right? It's just going to be one signature check. And then once you have that, I think the walls are going to really rapidly come down in terms of composability. So that's kind of part of what I'm, I'm super doing excited in the future.
00:31:12.494 - 00:31:38.374, Speaker B: So like, I don't know, like the cool composition there would be like if you're using a CRM provided price feed that you're also using SRM and like composing that with tokens that are bridged over to, on Ethereum. To me that's kind of like how you can start having like new business models that are like cross chain that are, would not be possible in Ethereum alone.
00:31:39.304 - 00:32:08.944, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree. And I think that like it's, you know, I think that there's like a lot of, I think that, that there's just a ton of potential there to build things that are just super powerful and that are, that are a lot more that, that actually can use that power to buy some, you know, to buy some trust in part of the trade off error.
00:32:10.244 - 00:32:40.266, Speaker B: Do you think like that, do you think the data like that, that information is more, is valuable? Or like me as a trader, I like when I was trying to like build my models, I was always like at the bottom tier of getting data because I'm like an individual, right? Trying to like, right, get like option tick data from like options root or wherever they scrape it from, right?
00:32:40.410 - 00:33:51.794, Speaker C: Right. I think you have to ask like realistically speaking, what are you doing? This is all relative, right? Like when you ask about, you know, when you ask about how much speed you need, the answer is what are you doing? You know, and I think that like if your goal is to go head to head with other HFT firms on, you know, 10th of a basis point trades on CME futures, then like if you don't have radio towers set up, your own tower set up, like you're, you're already falling behind, you know, like if you're not, if you have, like, if you're not like this is a street fucking line from Chicago to New York. Like we didn't, we don't have a mile bend in it. Like if you're not at that level you're not on, you're going to have trouble really competing head to head. But then you turn around and, like, what's your goal? Like, your goal is to have liquidations work on a DeFi protocol. You have to ask, on what scale do markets move enough to liquidate people? The answer is 10 seconds. That's realistically the answer.
00:33:51.794 - 00:34:07.354, Speaker C: Then you're saying, yeah, if there's a second latency in the system, that's fine, but if there's ten minutes latency, then when things really move, you're going to have bankruptcies and you're going to have callbacks.
00:34:08.614 - 00:34:09.394, Speaker B: Yep.
00:34:11.054 - 00:34:28.054, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, I noticed, by the way, that there are some questions popping up in this, this side panel, you know, and so, you know, I don't know if there's like a few of the.
00:34:30.394 - 00:34:30.682, Speaker B: You.
00:34:30.698 - 00:35:09.224, Speaker C: Know, I'll maybe just blow through a few of those, and then there's one or two. I'm interested in asking you, is it possible to build a derivative, decentralized exchange absolutely unambiguously, but basically only on Solana? That's not quite true, but it's actually close to true. If you want to be fully on chain, and if you took a current serum, Dex launched a borrow lending protocol in about a day. You'd build a GUI that composes them together to create derivative stacks, and it just work and be fast and efficient. But you actually do need a lot of TPS. Like, this thing's going to be consuming hundreds of gps. So that's sort of like ballparks, the speed of the chain that you need for it.
00:35:09.224 - 00:35:37.882, Speaker C: If you don't have tens of thousands, a single order book is going to be crashing the chain, but you can do it. I think that's one thing that's super powerful about Solana, is that it can support that. One question for you. What crypto company or business would you start if you had the time? I sort of done a few of those. You know, if, like, if you didn't need to worry about Solana, what's the second thing you'd start?
00:35:38.058 - 00:35:55.474, Speaker B: Oh, man. Okay, so I've been, like, dreaming about this for like a decade now. Is that you can run. This is like a science fiction project. So you can. It's possible for to build a communication network using neutrinos, because they don't interfere. Right.
00:35:55.474 - 00:36:24.212, Speaker B: They can actually pass for the center of the earth. So you can cut the latency down from, like, New York to Chicago. Right. Instead of going terrestrial radio, which is going to go over the curvature, you can actually shortcut it through that core. Or, like, New York, you know, New York to Japan. So if I had, like, enough funding, this is what I would be, like, experimenting with. How do we, like, produce neutrinos and detect them? Because I think that's kind of like the.
00:36:24.212 - 00:36:46.724, Speaker B: That would, like, break people's brains if it works. But this is good. This was part of why I wanted to build Solana is that, like, when I realized that I had, like, a source of time outside of consensus, I kind of broke my brain and I was like, oh, okay. This is something like, that's actually like, I think pushes the boundaries of, like, engineering. So those are like, the challenges that I always look for.
00:36:48.704 - 00:36:50.392, Speaker C: Yeah, that's super cool.
00:36:50.448 - 00:36:53.480, Speaker B: I don't think it's possible yet, but I imagine. Right?
00:36:53.512 - 00:36:56.594, Speaker C: Like, I think I need throw enough money possible.
00:36:56.714 - 00:37:24.814, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I don't know what's. What's missing there, but that would be, like, what I would be working on. I think, like, you're basically like serum was the idea that I had was that should be running on Solana, and I would have started that myself. But, like, you guys are, like, way more equipped and way better at it and understand trading a lot more than like, an operating system engineer. So this was like, kind of like the best partner we could find for that.
00:37:25.954 - 00:38:11.990, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been super exciting. And I have to say it was, like, super exciting also for us to be able to remove this giant thing tying our hands behind our back in Defi of like. And then you have to make sure it consumes almost no compute to be able to use Solana, we were sort of like, okay, no, we can sort of do what we want here as long as we're careful about it. So one thing which a few people have asked, basically various versions of here is basically, at what point is Solana not enough? Once you start hitting throughput concerns there. And I can tell you right now where we are. If you go to solanabeach.com comma, you can see what the network is using and it goes up and down with stuff.
00:38:11.990 - 00:38:48.514, Speaker C: But I think generally, we're talking about hundreds to 1000 TPs that it's using right now. It's a factor of, I don't know, 50 to 100 away from being constrained as is. But I think if that were the answer, that's fucking terrifying. Right? Like that. That would be a way of saying, like, yes, you can build things a hell of a lot more powerful than defi, but, like, billions of people, definitely not like, you know, it's sort of like, you know, you got your factor of 100 congrats, or a factor of 10,000 or something, but like, it's still capped what you can do. But I think that's not the case. And yes, so to kind of like.
00:38:50.134 - 00:39:31.998, Speaker B: Like the kind of crazy part is that like when we started this, we were using like much more expensive systems with four GPU cards to get the same performance that you get now without even any GPU's. But those GPU's are still there and Nvidia actually shipped one that is like four times more powerful. So if you go to, like, our forums, there's people experimenting with newer builds and they're seeing performance over like around 300,000 gps. So, like, you kind of like. And this is still just a single box using consumer hardware that like, you can go on Amazon and like, click and it'll be delivered to your house within like, you know, 24 hours.
00:39:32.046 - 00:39:41.498, Speaker C: Yeah. And to be clear, it's not going to be a $50 computer. But we're also not talking about like a million dollar supercomputer, right. We're talking about like standard desktop, like expenses.
00:39:41.546 - 00:39:48.162, Speaker B: Yeah. Like it's an expensive gamer machine. So like five k. But that's cheap.
00:39:48.218 - 00:39:52.882, Speaker C: Compared to like what, AWS compared to mining rigs.
00:39:53.058 - 00:39:58.794, Speaker B: Right. Or two, or like servers that exchanges use. Right. Like, or anything like that.
00:39:58.834 - 00:40:05.364, Speaker C: Like, yeah, those systems, yeah, I mean, FTX is spending, I mean, it's spending millions a year on servers.
00:40:07.704 - 00:40:45.372, Speaker B: So that question is basically like, are we going to see steady state growth that is going to get us to those performance limits? Are we going to see like spikes that are like black swan event spikes? And there's different ways to deal with those. Like, for the spikes, you can actually pretty quickly get validators to upgrade their machines to a cloud system that's much more powerful for that duration of the swan event. But that like, rotation is as fast as just moving a key pair over. Like, literally it can be done in under a minute. Yeah.
00:40:45.548 - 00:40:54.452, Speaker C: And since you could just rent extra capacity to validate more transactions per second if people are willing to pay three times as much or whatever for them, I guess.
00:40:54.548 - 00:41:13.136, Speaker B: Yeah. And then that's like the difference, I think, to me in terms of, like, what is scalable and what isn't is like how fast can you like, solve a problem? It's like, is it going to take you six months to build a new architecture? Right. Or like two minutes to move hardware.
00:41:13.200 - 00:41:29.004, Speaker C: Yeah. And also just in terms of base scaling, like, my sense is that there's a factor of 100 to 10,000. Is that right, that you think you could get without the world improving its hardware just from, like, you know, kind of like. Like making efficient each step of Solana.
00:41:29.824 - 00:41:55.216, Speaker B: Yeah, there's, like, some kind of. Some stuff that's coming in the pipeline is so Berkeley packet filter. The thing that is interpreting, like, although serum, the program. Right. That runs serum, it's using an interpreter right now. It's actually been like a very robust jit, which means it's converting to machine code, and that's about 20 x improvement. So we're, like, in the testing phases for that, just in, like, raw compute.
00:41:55.216 - 00:42:40.884, Speaker B: There's a bunch of stuff in the cryptography that we're optimizing and a bunch of stuff in latencies. The kind of, like, the hardest part isn't so much increasing TPS, because that, like, you know, imagine, like, our network is a bunch of computers, and something happens where we need more tps, we can literally just double the number of computers and send them to every one of those people. And that's like, a fixed cost. Right. But the hard part is reducing the latency, how fast it can switch. Yeah, and those optimizations are, like, blood, sweat, and tears. But, like, I firmly believe we can get it down to, like, 100 milliseconds, which is going to be close to the speed of light.
00:42:41.424 - 00:42:57.326, Speaker C: That's. That's super cool. And I think it matters. And people say, like, does a lot of people, I think, are trying to figure out, does latency matter? Sort of. My answer is, like, I mean, it's different for different applications, but you're a human. You know what speed matters for most of what you do, right. It's just everyone knows the answer.
00:42:57.326 - 00:43:41.368, Speaker C: Like, how long after. How long are you frustrated that you click something and nothing happens? And the answer is 100 milliseconds matters. But isn't it, like, that's sort of what you're expecting as, like, human reaction time? A second is about what you expect for, like, round trip responsiveness from things, and anything more than that starts to feel kind of slow. And so I think there's, like, a natural scale for this, for a lot of things where, like, you're talking about, you know, 100 milliseconds is sort of the base unit of latency. And getting down to that doesn't allow everything, but it allows a lot of things to feel super smooth. Another thing I'd say, just like, when I hear that is that's so different than how almost any other chain talks. The way that you talked about, like, throughput on.
00:43:41.368 - 00:44:02.248, Speaker C: On Solana. It's like almost every other chance. Like, this is the number. It's like, this is hard coded into the protocol. Maybe in five years, we're gonna have some giant clash over whether to double that number. And I think that's Lana's. Like, like, the whole fucking protocol is built around, like, no, bigger numbers are better if you can get them.
00:44:02.248 - 00:44:35.534, Speaker C: And, like, you know, we should try to naturally scale with. With Moore's law, and we should try to remove inefficiencies where we can to grab those measly factors of 100 in total value of the network in limit cases. And it's just almost no one else is thinking about it that way. And it's just hugely different to think about scaling not as a checkbox, but as a core thing that can always be better and that you should always be, you know, be keeping in mind.
00:44:36.634 - 00:45:18.328, Speaker B: I mean, this is like, I think. I mean, I'm an engineer, right? And this is what I spent, like a decade on, because I don't even know how to think differently, right? So this is. Yeah, this is why we're doing it. It's more mostly, like, I think there's also kind of think a fundamental reason why that's important is because the lower you can make those, the higher, like, capacity you can increase, the cheaper the transactions get, and you can start. Then, like, kind of. It becomes almost stupid to not use it. If you're talking about building a social network, you could build it on a decentralized platform and capture more value because it's decentralized.
00:45:18.328 - 00:45:34.384, Speaker B: And if the costs of operations are now as cheap as AWS, you wouldn't not make that choice. You would just start using the system as AWS at some point, because.
00:45:34.924 - 00:45:52.304, Speaker C: Yeah, and more generally, it's like, hey, I've got an idea. What if you took the Internet, but you restricted it to only 2015 levels of throughput? Everyone be like, no, how about not that idea? Like, how about we're doing now instead? Like, I kind of like the fact that things that we can do more now and that things aren't slowing to a halt over time.
00:45:53.444 - 00:46:00.232, Speaker B: So there's a question for you, I think, what needs to happen to get, like, 100 x daily trading volume and zero?
00:46:00.408 - 00:46:15.564, Speaker C: Oh, it's so easy. I mean, it's right. And when I say that, why do I say it's so easy? First, I'm going to give a stupid answer to that question. Let's say. First of all, I'm not going to self trade. Right. The easiest way to sit there clicking, but like whatever, ignore that.
00:46:15.564 - 00:46:55.934, Speaker C: If you want 100 x trading volume, what would you do? Ethereum Defi has shown an answer here. You can pay people for it. So if we put the second we put yield on serum, the numbers explode. Now it's sort of silly, in the same way that ethereum based Defi numbers are silly right now. We could do it and kind of thinking about doing it almost just as like a lark, like what would happen, you know, if we paid like $100,000 today for people to trade on serum? Like, how much volume would there be? I think you get a lot of volume. So, you know, the first answer is that you put some yield in the system and all the numbers go wacky. But I think a key part of that is I can support it.
00:46:55.934 - 00:47:13.226, Speaker C: It's not like you can't do that. It doesn't break if you do that. It can support billions of dollars of volume today with matching engines and everything else. And the liquidity is there too. You pull up one of these. Pull up the serum, Dex. It's liquid.
00:47:13.226 - 00:47:51.104, Speaker C: It's comparable liquid to centralized exchanges. There's really nothing fundamentally stopping it except people choosing to use it as an execution platform. And whether it's because it's incentivized or whether it's just like, oh wait, this actually is as good as a centralized exchange experience. Not there yet. There's a lot of UI work that needs to be done, but it can get there and as liquid, and also it's on chain and compose well and trustlessly, that's pretty cool, right? And like some big firms decide to move over and start trading there, like literally overnight, it could happen. So it could be a three year grind or it could be like a 1 hour sprint or anything in between.
00:47:53.684 - 00:48:13.160, Speaker B: Do you, do you need, like, do you think that the yield kind of approaches are create like a customer base or are they kind of like modeless? Do you kind of just get like a, a bunch of users to jump in and then they leave?
00:48:13.312 - 00:49:00.934, Speaker C: They get everyone to bother getting over the activation energy. They're not going to stay if they don't want to stay, but they're going to have come in the first place. I think people are misusing it right now. The way I think yield makes sense is you have something that you think is a better product that you think if people only bothered to try, they'd stick with, but you can't get people to try. And it's just basically the market, you know, marketing budget, it's like a, you know, or just like a hassle compensation fund, you know, for bothering to, like, go to solid or whatever. And like, you know, so I think, like, it's great used that way as a, like, come on, once, just try it out, you know, I promise you'll like it type thing. But if you don't think they'll like it, if that's your only reason they're there, then as soon as the yield goes away, they're gone.
00:49:02.074 - 00:49:17.178, Speaker B: I never heard that analogy. And, like, I kind of love it. That's like a, that's like, that's awesome. That's an awesome way to think about it. Like, as a. As effectively, like when PayPal, likes, would send you, like, what did they send you? $20? It's at the start, right? To go.
00:49:17.226 - 00:49:43.480, Speaker C: Exactly. One thing. One person who's building a really fucking cool application on Cirm, which I hope he's going to come out in the next month or so, I might be the biggest one of the protocol that they said. I think they're building a wallet. They just, like, you create a wallet, they auto drop, like, you know, a dollar of soul in it, and it's sort of like, actually makes experience a lot better. Like, you don't have to go through that startup step that everyone fucking hates. Like, oh, God, I have a metamask account.
00:49:43.480 - 00:49:54.032, Speaker C: There's no ethereum in it. Can't fucking do anything. Time to go to binance and buy this, like, 0.1 ether. Send it over. Okay, now I can do this thing. Now I can kind of kick start this.
00:49:54.032 - 00:50:20.404, Speaker C: Now I can go to uniswap and buy more ethereum or whatever. There's the same thing on serum where, like, step one is get like a penny of Solana so that you can then go to zero and buy more Solana, so you. And you really don't need much. It's a hundredth of a penny for gas. So it's not like you need thousands of dollars, but you literally can't do the first transaction. So you have to just. Things like that, I think are, like, really effective ways to spend a little bit of money to, like, get people over the hump.
00:50:22.304 - 00:50:46.544, Speaker B: Yeah, that is like, those are like the. It's a little different than yield, where you are basically trying to hack people into, like, to, like, move liquidity over. Like, I think, like that. That's like a. Yeah, the. Treating it as an activity like that, like, kind of activation function, I think is.
00:50:47.644 - 00:51:13.794, Speaker C: Yeah, so I really don't like quoting numbers that come from yield. Like, I really don't like saying TPL or volume of something that's yield based because those numbers are totally fake. Like, they're there because of the yield, and you sort of can't count them until you get rid of the yield. But I think it's a totally legit thing to do as an activation energy thing and say, like, disclaimer, ignore these numbers for the next week. We know they're inflated, but we think even after the week, they're gonna be higher than they were before, because we will have gotten a bunch of people to, like, figure out how to use the system.
00:51:15.294 - 00:52:35.394, Speaker B: So there's a question. What industries, apart from Defi, do you think Solana is uniquely suitable for? I think that markets in general are very applicable to a ton of industries in the world today, because one of the things we did demos on early on was very boring 5g deployments, but structured in a way where you had people that could bring in arbitrary access points and devices with cryptography that could effectively associate with those access points. And this is a market because the spectrum is controlled by a company that defines that market. And they allow people to come in and bid to be a provider, right? And then clients go and dynamically purchase those resources. And being like a market that can support, effectively hundreds of millions of people driving at 60 miles an hour, and dynamically bidding and associating with a dozen of these things per second is like a hard problem. It's probably nearly the same kind of exchange of trades as serum. So there's a ton of industries that, if you scale them globally, become markets.
00:52:35.394 - 00:53:28.004, Speaker B: And I think that's a really cool thing about Defi, is that if you take, you know, like, I think that like five g and kind of going into that thing is like a very long slog to get there and like, to get to a commercialized implementation of this, it's much easier to do this with an exchange where people trade crypto, much harder to do this with physical hardware and humans that have devices and big companies that have, like, monopolies on frequencies. But I think that's what the world is going to look like. You kind of saw this already with helium, like, where they popped up, like, in the unlicensed band, a bunch of iot based bands that can now communicate. Like, you can build your own wireless network with Defi. To me, that's like one of those super cool things.
00:53:29.184 - 00:54:08.914, Speaker C: So I would almost flip it on the question on its head, though, and I agree with everything you're saying, but I don't know for which things that you do. Is it important for it to take less than a second to get feedback and cost less than a penny to click a button? I kind of think the answer is, for which things is that not important? Like, I think just for the average thing you do online, it sort of is true. Right? Like, it's just like. Like, a lot of things in the world are things which, like, at some scale, yes, they can be on chain, and before that, they just can't be. And this crosses that threshold for a lot of activity. Like, I think you go from, like, finding niche things that can fit in. Into it to, like, saying, like, yeah, I don't know.
00:54:08.914 - 00:54:28.334, Speaker C: You know, 20% of the world's activity theoretically could be there and, like, couldn't be there with the less scaling thing. And I think that that's just, like, a massive difference. It's a difference between a big thing and the biggest thing, and that's. That's like five orders of magnitude difference in potential.
00:54:29.684 - 00:54:52.984, Speaker B: Yep. I mean, like, yeah, I'm. I think, like, a lot of web two digital stuff is prime for that as well. And also because I think they're effectively markets at this point, too. You look at something like Google, it's a ton of its revenue comes from exchange. Like, ad exchanges. Right? Like, people buying and selling pixels to users.
00:54:52.984 - 00:55:15.706, Speaker B: Make. Making the stuff, making those markets decentralized and putting them on chain will force the kind of protocols that prevent user privacy and kind of, like, do all the things we want, like the Internet to do. To just suck less. Right. Like, to not steal our data and to, like, interface with us in, like, a reasonable way where you don't have to guard yourself against what you're using.
00:55:15.890 - 00:55:16.654, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:17.074 - 00:55:23.994, Speaker B: So that. That, to me, is, like, kind of another one of those markets that's. That's possible.
00:55:26.814 - 00:55:42.034, Speaker C: Yeah, totally agree. Um, I suspect Austin's about to kick us out. Uh, given that it's coming up on an hour. I don't really know how the timing works, but I think he tried to kick us out 15 minutes ago. We just ignored him. Um. Um, I.
00:55:42.034 - 00:55:44.438, Speaker C: But, um, there's a.
00:55:44.486 - 00:55:53.266, Speaker B: There's a question here. Like, I'd love to do a chat with Sebastian and, like, his experience of working with Solana one day, so that would be fun, I think, for, like, for devs to hear.
00:55:53.370 - 00:56:02.694, Speaker C: Oh, I totally. I think that'd be great. And just like, sort of. Yeah. Like war stories from, you know, from the. From the western. For eastern front, I guess.
00:56:02.694 - 00:56:27.234, Speaker C: But, yeah, I think that that's that that would be. I'd be. I'd be super interested to hear that. We should. We should set that up. Sebastian, for those who don't know, is one of the. The kind of core serum developers who's been building out a lot of the more intricate on chain pieces of core serum objects.
00:56:31.374 - 00:56:35.394, Speaker B: Cool. I think we are coming in on the hour.
00:56:38.294 - 00:57:01.694, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think, you know, it's been fun chatting, as always. We should do these more. And I mean, really excited to see everything that comes out of the hackathon. I think that. I think it's sort of ready. I think the ecosystem is ready to take on a bunch more stuff, and I think that's also the thing that's going to move it forward.
00:57:04.554 - 00:57:48.464, Speaker B: Likewise. I think this is like the first or the second kind of bridge to Ethereum. There's more to come. There's more interesting things that we're building, and each one of these is reducing some of the technical risk and improving decentralization and just making this stuff more robust and more transparent to use for the long haul throughout just the normal user interactions, but also through those blacksmith events. So I'm really excited to like to see the systems mature to the level that I feel like we can actually take on the CME, New York stock exchanges and, you know, Google's and Facebook's of the world.
00:57:50.404 - 00:57:52.624, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree with that.
00:57:53.884 - 00:57:54.984, Speaker B: All right, folks.
00:57:57.884 - 00:58:03.544, Speaker C: With that, take it away. Austin, I didn't want to interrupt.
00:58:04.304 - 00:58:05.128, Speaker A: Thank you, Sam.
00:58:05.216 - 00:58:06.080, Speaker B: Thank you. Totally.
00:58:06.192 - 00:58:18.724, Speaker A: That was amazing. I don't know if we got to all the questions, so if you do have additional questions, feel free to jump on our twitter. We have a promotional post where you can throw them in there and we can see if we can get them answered for you guys.
00:58:19.344 - 00:58:19.920, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:58:19.952 - 00:58:54.860, Speaker A: Thank you everyone who showed up. We had people continuing to join well after when we were supposed to stop, so it's always great to see, as always. Visit solana.com hackathon for additional details on the hackathon. Registration is open until the 27th, and our next event is at 03:00 p.m. On Monday, which is going to be an analysis of the recent defi boom with Sam Toli, Robert Leshner from compound Toronto from gauntlets. We have Fernando from balancer, and Michael from curve.
00:58:54.860 - 00:59:00.344, Speaker A: So it's loaded, loaded speaker panel, so it should be a good one.
00:59:00.904 - 00:59:01.584, Speaker B: Thank you all.
00:59:01.624 - 00:59:02.844, Speaker A: Thank you all for joining.

00:59:04.640 - 00:59:05.604, Speaker A: Thank you, Sam.
00:59:05.984 - 00:59:07.456, Speaker B: Thank you guys. Awesome.
00:59:07.520 - 00:59:08.024, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:59:08.144 - 00:59:09.704, Speaker A: Bye, everyone. Bye.
