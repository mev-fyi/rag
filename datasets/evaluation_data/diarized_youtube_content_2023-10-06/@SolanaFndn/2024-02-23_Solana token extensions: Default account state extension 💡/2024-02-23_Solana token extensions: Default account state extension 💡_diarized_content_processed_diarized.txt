00:00:00.560 - 00:00:39.084, Speaker A: The default account state token extension allows accounts to have a default state upon creation. This gives token issuers greater control over the token distribution by limiting who can hold the token. So how does this work? Let's say that Bob has a token account that with the default account state as frozen, this means that Alice cannot send Bob those tokens until the token issuer thaws Bob's account. This puts greater control over the token issuer instead of Bob enabling allow list for tokens. You can check out more about the default account state token extension@solana.com.
