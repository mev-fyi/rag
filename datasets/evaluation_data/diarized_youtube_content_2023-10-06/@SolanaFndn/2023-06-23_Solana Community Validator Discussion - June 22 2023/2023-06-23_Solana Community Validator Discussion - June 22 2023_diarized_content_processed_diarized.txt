00:00:01.640 - 00:00:41.660, Speaker A: Okay, there we go. Welcome everyone to the Solana Community Validator Discussion June 22, 2023 agenda today. So we'll have the usual validator updates, another reminder about breakpoint, and some of the validator specific programming there. There is a upcoming community led validator call. It's tentatively scheduled for the 28th. Pretty sure that's gonna be the date, but just I'll update you there. A little quick recap about the educational workshop that happened last week, and then finally we'll kick it over to the lava network.
00:00:41.660 - 00:01:26.344, Speaker A: They're going to be talking about decentralized RPC infrastructure that they're building and opportunities for operators to join the network. So get started. First of all, 114.19 is now recommended for Mainnet beta. There are ongoing feature activations happening in Mainnet right now, so the sort of new way of announcing those is through MB announcements. You'll see announcements about feature activations upcoming, what epoch they will be activated in, and what minimum version you need for that activation. So be sure to monitor that channel for all announcements.
00:01:26.344 - 00:02:05.614, Speaker A: And the change log is linked here as well. For the 114 release for testnet, 116.1 is now recommended for testnet there were some issues in 1160 that relate to paths. All those should be resolved in 116 one, except I think of these known issues. I think the only one that still is not resolved is the get health issue. Otherwise, the rest of these should all be resolved in 116.1. So if you run into any problems related to pathing, make sure to report that in testnet validators.
00:02:05.614 - 00:02:57.274, Speaker A: All right, let me there you go. Yeah, and a reminder, I think I mentioned this already, but the slant assist tuner has been deprecated or removed entirely in 116. So if you were relying on that before, make sure to check out the docs and manually tune your system for the validator. Any questions on the mainnet or Testnet updates? Okay, like I mentioned last time, breakpoint's coming up. It will be from October 30 to November 3. However, MeV camp is happening the day before. So October 29 and there will be a validator track this time happening on October 30.
00:02:57.274 - 00:03:46.774, Speaker A: The planning for the validator event is ongoing, so please check out MbPlanning and discord to get involved and either follow along or help contribute to talks or programming. For breakpoint. I think the discussion is happening in public there related to this, there's going to be a community led validator call next week, June 28, 1800 utc. I think is the tentative plan. Again, the updates will be happening in MB planning, but if you're interested all in this validator track. I think they're going to be discussing the programming and some of the logistics on that call. So definitely something to check out if you're planning to attend breakpoint and want to participate in the programming for the event.
00:03:46.774 - 00:04:28.494, Speaker A: One last quick recap here. So we had the second half of validator setup for the validator educational workshop last week. It was a long one. I think we ended up going for about an hour and a half, but I think a lot of good topics there. All the validator workshops should be on this YouTube playlist and the plan is to do another educational workshop on the 19th July 19, same time, 1700 UTC. If anyone has suggestions for a topic, please let me know. I don't have a topic scheduled yet.
00:04:28.494 - 00:05:06.294, Speaker A: If anybody wants to lead the next call, that would be great as well. So yeah, anyone looking to participate either in suggesting a topic or leading the call, let me know. But one way or another, July 19 planning to do another educational workshop? Any questions, thoughts on this quiet group? All right, well that's all the updates I've got. So I'm going to kick it over to the Lava network team and they're going to talk about their distributed RPC infrastructure.
00:05:07.554 - 00:05:46.194, Speaker B: So let me hi aim, thank you very much. Hello guys, I'm Omer. Excited to be talking to you. Let me share my deck and we'll get started. Okay, so I'm representing lava. Lava is a blockchain based solution to decentralize access to RPC in general. And in particular, we'll talk about decentralizing solar access and the possibilities for collaboration and benefit for validators and node runners.
00:05:46.194 - 00:06:52.944, Speaker B: Okay, so to make it short, access to Solana RPC infra is relying on a handful of providers and all of the DApps that are not running their own nodes infrastructure because it's hard to maintain and you're losing the benefits of web3 or relying on that. So in order to make it more resilient and decentralized and chain agnostic and lower the middleman between node runners and validators that are participating in the community and want to be engaged with more developers directly, get feedback, that's what we're aiming to build. So I'm presenting Lava network. It's a coordinated peer to peer session between the apps and the node runners. There is no middleman, there is no one in between the node you're serving and the Dapp that's using it. There are some protocols in between, but it's a decentralized protocol. Everything is open source.
00:06:52.944 - 00:07:40.122, Speaker B: Okay, so how does it work? Node runners are joining the lava network via the lava blockchain by sending a transaction. In that transaction they're coordinating their listening endpoints could be more than one. Then they are automatically paired with developers that subscribed on the lava network to get service. There are various ways to subscribe. Obviously we are offering a web interface to lower barriers of entry, but any developer can do it with a CLI on the blockchain in a fully decentralized manner. We're currently in production grade testnet. We've been running in Testnet for the last year and we have several rpcs.
00:07:40.122 - 00:08:34.494, Speaker B: And just recently we added Solana and we have our first providers. Providers are paired with the consumer based on several factors. It's not random, it is changing periodically to keep it decentralized and unpredictable, protect consumers and make it fair for providers. And the pairing is affected by stuff like geolocation, which are very important. You don't want consumers from the wrong area and they will just get bad service and they will clutter your RPC for a long time while waiting for a response. Stuff like quality of service, which is subjective to the consumer. And we have in our roadmap clustering mechanism to pair consumers that are happy with a certain service, with those providers more often and the DApps get service and they paying a subscription fee.
00:08:34.494 - 00:09:32.594, Speaker B: We have built a decentralized SaaS with a subscription with a fixed cost for consumers for simplicity, and that's creating a very good balance of cost to value. Providers are rewarded according to reward proofs and quality of service. On latency, reliability and accuracy latency is how fast responses were given to the consumer. Reliability is how accurate and precise the response without downtime. And accuracy means that the data itself was a legitimate data. Also there is ranking for sync, showing that you give a block that's not too old, meaning you're caching too hard or you're way back and lost sync. This is all measured in order to give also providers feedback on their service and they know where they can be improving themselves.
00:09:32.594 - 00:10:49.624, Speaker B: Why would providers want to be improving themselves? Excellent providers are paired with more users. So it's ecosystem that is improving upon itself and gives better and better service utilizing the fact that that web3 is fully decentralized and we have multiple parties towards the same goal and incentive aligned. So how do node runners benefit from all of that? So we are calling you guys to join early on our testnet. It's a new distribution channel for you guys to expose yourselves, show some presence, and we have activeproviders that are getting tweets showing a value usage. And in the future it might give you eligibility for incentives program at Mainnet, which is subject to the independent daos approval and legal availability. We are providing also optimization tools for you guys, such as feedback on quality of service. And we have down our roadmap built in caching of the protocol and you could see how well you're doing relative to others.
00:10:49.624 - 00:11:45.720, Speaker B: And joining early gives access to new features. And we are getting feedback very seriously and building upon the feedback of our providers asking for certain Prometheus metrics. And this is the time where working hard on building, and if you want to make that product fitting for your needs, that's the stage to join, feel how it works and affect how it looks in the future. I'm repeating it's completely decentralized open source, and we have guys offering commits also. And we have a new offering which is decentralized public RPC. And let me get into more on that. So what is decentralized public RPC? We are letting chains and ecosystems create decentralization pools for node runners.
00:11:45.720 - 00:13:06.946, Speaker B: Those pools are meant to offer good service, a place for developers that want to build in the initial stages of development. While public RPC fits their needs, they're experimenting, they're building, and we want them to have a home to go to. And we want that home also to lower the barriers of entry between developers and node runners. So why should node runners join those decentralized pools? First? They're getting renowned by being there. Also down our roadmap, pools are going to be incentivized by the ecosystems, okay? This is subject to the ecosystems, and the rewards are going to be distributed from the ecosystem. And this is something we're striving to get to in order to get more traction between node runners and developers, making it a bounty system for providing service where right now it's kind of unsupervised and some public RPCs could be pruning too much or providing inferior service and there's no visibility upon it. Where in the lava blockchain we have metadata on the sessions, not the data itself.
00:13:06.946 - 00:13:42.674, Speaker B: Right? It's peer to peer, but metadata on the session, such as quality of service and the amount of relays when they're claiming their lava rewards. So we have visibility on what's going on and that's good for everybody. And yeah, I'm gonna leave some room for questions. If you guys are interested to learn more, you can scan the QR, you could join the Lavanet Discord channel engage with us. I'm active there. You could ask me directly, but I'm welcoming you guys for questions right now.
00:13:48.394 - 00:14:04.490, Speaker A: Thank you. Any questions for the Lava team? Yes, there's a question in chat about contact information to discuss more in the future.
00:14:04.642 - 00:14:11.414, Speaker B: Yeah, you could address me directly in our discord. Let me just pop up the handle and share it here.
00:14:36.974 - 00:14:49.576, Speaker A: Another thing that I thought was interesting when we chatted earlier was how you ensure security of the network to make sure that there's no malicious node runners. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah.
00:14:49.680 - 00:16:23.612, Speaker B: So lava protocol implements an accuracy protocol within our communication. So consumer messages are wrapped with headers that are abiding by the Lava protocol and provider responses are cryptographically signed and they're containing extra metadata besides the RPC itself, the response that metadata could be used to compare between node runners, the responses. And we have an on chain resolution mechanism for fraud detection. So in case finalized data is different between two providers, the conflict goes on chain and there is a jury and an opt in mechanism for providers to vote on the right response. And the majority of that decides which is the wrong provider and that results in on chain actions that could be either jail or downtime or even slash of part of the stake providers are staking on the lava network. They're getting rewards in lava tokens and this insurance alignment. So as long as the service you're providing is accurate and the periodic checks that you're being tested upon are correct, then you're getting rewards and your quality of service reports are higher and rewards are higher.
00:16:23.612 - 00:16:51.584, Speaker B: And in case there are conflicts and it turns out this was malicious data, you could be kicked out of the network and even lose part of the stake that you've been putting. Obviously during Testnet, it doesn't matter that much, but we are experimenting with a protocol and making it. We are tightening security as we go by leaving room for errors and misconfigurations until we get to the point where we feel confident enough.
00:16:53.844 - 00:17:02.694, Speaker A: There's more of a comment from Blake, but he was saying Everstake has extra node. Do you, are you familiar with that product and kind of compare between the two?
00:17:03.314 - 00:18:05.074, Speaker B: Personally, I'm not familiar with Eversticks external node, but I can tell you that lava is not implementing a JSON RPC specific solution that goes between multiple providers. Our solution is API agnostic and that API agnosticism, if I can say that, lets you create advanced APIs such as indexing with graphQL or even integrate multiple different chains at the same DAP, that could be beneficial for, I don't know, bridging value or making smart trades across different chains. So lava knows to communicate with multiple chains at the same time. And we're going for multi chain concurrent access for consumers where they have access through their project to everything they need.
00:18:06.374 - 00:18:31.134, Speaker A: Yeah, makes sense. Any more questions for the team? All right, well, thank you. If there any other topics or questions people like to bring up, we've got a little bit of time. If not, we can end early.
00:18:36.434 - 00:18:38.174, Speaker B: I want to say, you guys.
00:18:39.354 - 00:18:43.170, Speaker A: Oh, Steve, do you have a question?
00:18:43.322 - 00:19:14.794, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I was going to. Yeah, I didn't mean to cut you off, Omar, there, but I was going to say if anybody. I mean, I see a couple people here that offer, like, you know, guidance on validator support. Do you see anybody that gets the, like, their validators not responding? Like, please. Like, hopefully they're reporting metrics, but, like, don't tell them to wipe. I think there's, like, some very subtle bug me and. Me and Jeff Peseta are trying to track down, but.
00:19:14.794 - 00:19:50.034, Speaker C: Well, yeah, I guess, like, you know, if it happens to be, like, in the middle of the night when, you know, the US people like me and Jeff are not on, like, asking to save their logs and copy off their rocks, tv or whatever, but I think there's, like, some very subtle bug that we're trying to track. But, yeah, for the most part, the wipe your. The wipe your ledger and, like, restart that. That should be, like, mostly done. So I'm hoping that's not a. I'm hoping that advice should be like, yeah, not. Not a thing going forward.
00:19:50.034 - 00:20:02.374, Speaker C: So I get it. Like, you need up time, but, yeah, that one specifically, Jeff and I are banging our heads on, so we would appreciate any clues that we can get.
00:20:03.554 - 00:20:06.534, Speaker A: Is there a GitHub issue or more details to.
00:20:07.114 - 00:20:23.362, Speaker C: There is an issue, but it's like, it's very. It's so, you know, we've seen it, like, one in a thousand or something. Like, I. Yeah, I mean, we have. We have, you know, tens. Tens or hundreds of nodes that are disposed. We haven't been able to repro it.
00:20:23.362 - 00:20:41.078, Speaker C: So I don't know. I. I almost. I. We're bordering the line of wasting time on it, but again, if somebody sees it, ping me or Jeff. Jeff Pesata. And, yeah, we would love to look down about.
00:20:41.078 - 00:20:55.234, Speaker C: Yeah, hopefully, like, the advice of wiping your ledger. Like, don't. Don't do that anymore. Like, you know, it's. That should be much worse than fetching a new snapshot, unless you're like, you know, 50k back.
00:20:57.134 - 00:21:03.482, Speaker A: Just. Just so I understand, it's when, uh, a node just gets stuck. You're saying, like, it's not progressive. Yeah.
00:21:03.498 - 00:21:16.810, Speaker C: So this very specific one. Yeah, the. I feel like it. Yeah, it's a very intermittent bug. And it's like if you. You unpack a snapshot and your node just gets, like, stuck on that snapshot slot. And I get that.
00:21:16.810 - 00:21:28.954, Speaker C: Like it's, you know, maybe the reporting. It could be hard for, you know, operators, you know, unless you. You know, you really know what you're looking at to know that you're stuck on that slot.
00:21:28.994 - 00:21:29.122, Speaker A: But.
00:21:29.138 - 00:21:53.306, Speaker C: Yeah, the bug we're hunting specifically is. Yeah, like, you. You unpack at slot X and you get stuck at slot X plus one. And there's, for some reason, nodes, we've seen it like, again, like one in like a thousand where nodes were unable to repair at slot Xbox one. So Zan. Zan had one. He provided us some logs about.
00:21:53.306 - 00:22:09.178, Speaker C: We just really couldn't figure it out. And again, we've been unable to repro. But in general. Yeah. If people hit it. Yeah. Send us a ping or something.
00:22:09.178 - 00:22:13.214, Speaker C: And hopefully people are reporting metrics because we want to figure these out.
00:22:14.114 - 00:22:16.938, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:22:17.026 - 00:22:18.694, Speaker C: Sorry for that two minute ramble.
00:22:20.234 - 00:22:28.410, Speaker A: Very useful. I think people are probably hesitant to ping you, too. So it's good to hear the, you know, green light.
00:22:28.602 - 00:22:40.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm a night owl, so, you know, I'm us based. But tag me in the middle of night. I'll respond in the morning if I don't. So if you. If you have good logs to look at, I appreciate it.
00:22:41.754 - 00:22:55.494, Speaker A: Cool. All right, well, thank you to the lava network team. Thank you all for joining. Any final thoughts? Sound like you were saying something there, Omar, before we cut you off. Yeah.
00:22:55.534 - 00:22:58.394, Speaker B: I want to appreciate you guys. Thank you so much.
00:22:59.174 - 00:23:03.294, Speaker A: All right, great. Thank you. See you all in two weeks. Thanks.
