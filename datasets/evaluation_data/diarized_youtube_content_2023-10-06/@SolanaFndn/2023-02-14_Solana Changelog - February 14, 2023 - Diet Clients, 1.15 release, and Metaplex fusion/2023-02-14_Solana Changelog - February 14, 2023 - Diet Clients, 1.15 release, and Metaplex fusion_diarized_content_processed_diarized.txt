00:00:00.360 - 00:00:37.102, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's Solana Changelog, where we talk about the changes that happen on Solana Week by week. I'm joined today by Jonas, and Jonas is a new developer advocate at Solana foundation. So let's get started. So this week we saw a lot of changes that happened, and the grizzly thon is actually still happening. So that is a global hackathon where you can join, you can build a project, and you can enter into the hackathon to be seen by a ton of people. There's office hours that happen twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the grizzly Thawne hackathon Discord channel. And.
00:00:37.102 - 00:00:53.034, Speaker A: Yeah, so if you have questions, if you just want to know about, like, hey, I have an idea, or, I'm running into an error building on Solana. Feel free to join us during those office hours, and we'll be there to help you out. But, yeah, Jonas, what was the proposal of this week?
00:00:53.454 - 00:01:23.674, Speaker B: Oh, I found simd number ten. SIMD is like, protocol level proposals, and it's called diet clients. And these diet clients, it's a proposal to define a protocol for sampling the validators. So it also, like, a client which doesn't run the full node, could still figure out if there was an invalid state transition or maybe a double confirm attack. So what do you think about that? Like, how does it. Do you know how it works exactly, or.
00:01:24.014 - 00:01:57.874, Speaker A: Yeah, so if sense, it does sampling. I believe it does minority versus majority. So it can do sampling of a the minority stake of the 33% versus the 66% of stake. And so it's not as safe as doing the majority stake. But after a certain amount of confirmations, you can pretty much say that the minority stake is true. There's some math involved. You can read the full proposal to kind of dive into how that actually works.
00:01:57.874 - 00:02:02.874, Speaker A: It would be really cool to see this happen and come alive on Solana.
00:02:03.614 - 00:02:06.994, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds really cool. Maybe I run my own diet Clanton.
00:02:07.694 - 00:02:09.022, Speaker A: Yeah, it'd be fun.
00:02:09.198 - 00:02:38.074, Speaker B: There was one more cool commit that I found this week. It's a funny one. There was one last way, apparently, how you can create account that's not rent exempt. And, I don't know, somehow it was like a validator identity account, which I don't know if you know more details about it, but for somehow, somehow, somehow there was not enough rent in the account. So actually what they ended up doing was burning the rent in it.
00:02:38.194 - 00:03:17.502, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw it. So there's a feature flag now to burn the rent and disable that ability to create rent paying accounts via validator identity accounts. So that's really cool. It was fun to watch that in discord, actually be debugged and then see the solution come alive via commit on GitHub. So there were two other things that I wanted to mention that were not exactly commits, but good to know is that 1.15 was tagged and a release was created off of it at the time of this recording. I believe there was less 10% of stake on Testnet on 1.15,
00:03:17.502 - 00:03:40.122, Speaker A: but that's pretty cool that we're seeing movement onto another version coming out in the future. And on that note, there is going to call for like a 10% upgrade to 114.15 on mainnet beta right now. So that's really cool to see as well. Means that we're finally moving off of 1.13, which is the current version on Mainnet beta.
00:03:40.258 - 00:03:42.214, Speaker B: Yeah, it's always nice to see new versions.
00:03:43.074 - 00:03:50.734, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely is nice to see new versions coming out. Other than that. Jonas, what did you see for the resource of the week?
00:03:51.354 - 00:04:26.008, Speaker B: I found a nice thing at the hacker house in Turkey, there was a person who used metafix fusion to create a farming game. So the nice thing about metafix Fusion is you can have nfts which own different other nfts. And what he built is he's planting a seed, then he adds some water to it, and then at some point it evolves into a new NFT, which could be, for example, a tomato plant. And the nice thing, he is going to build a tutorial on that that we will share soon. So I'm very excited about people discovering new things and then teaching other people about it.
00:04:26.096 - 00:04:46.160, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really cool. I know that in the past a lot of people have been doing custom integrations and custom programs to do this type of thing that metaplex fusion now does by default. So it'll be really cool to kind of like see how much more can be created on top of this now that people have a base layer to use.
00:04:46.312 - 00:05:03.644, Speaker B: Yeah, there's many options. There's also raindrops, for example. That way you could probably also build a similar thing. All right, thank you very much everyone, for joining us. And make sure to tune in next week again where we have another bunch of very interesting commits for you.
00:05:04.264 - 00:05:06.688, Speaker A: All right, awesome. Yeah, see you next week.
00:05:06.856 - 00:05:07.584, Speaker B: See you next week.
