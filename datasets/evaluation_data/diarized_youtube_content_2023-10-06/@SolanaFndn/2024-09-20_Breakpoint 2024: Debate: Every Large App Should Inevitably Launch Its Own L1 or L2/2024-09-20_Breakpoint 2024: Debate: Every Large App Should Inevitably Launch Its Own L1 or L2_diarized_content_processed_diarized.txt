00:00:08.760 - 00:00:30.415, Speaker A: All right. Okay. I have a gong which seems fun. Cool. My name is Zucky. I will be moderating long time, sort of sovereign chain builder, but like now at this point pretty much it's all the same. So I'm excited to purely neutral in my opinion.
00:00:30.415 - 00:00:49.215, Speaker A: And Ben from and also he has this LP Army, LP rights advocate sort of Persona I guess. And Mason from Pantera. All right, who's going first?
00:00:49.755 - 00:00:50.843, Speaker B: Sure. Happy to.
00:00:50.939 - 00:00:51.547, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:51.691 - 00:00:52.963, Speaker C: Sad I don't hear the.
00:00:53.019 - 00:00:54.075, Speaker A: Do you want to do the gong?
00:00:54.195 - 00:01:44.021, Speaker B: Do the gong. Hey everyone. I'm excited to chat today for the affirmation that every large app should inevitably launch its own L2 or L1. The lifecycle of an application typically starts on an app launching on a general purpose chain in order to get access to users distribution liquidity until it gets sufficiently large where it can launch its own chain. We've seen this time and time again throughout Crypto from applications like pith, which was 10 to 20% of Solana transactions until it launched its own L1. We've seen this timeless times again on Ethereum and we've now started to see it even more in Solana with apps like Zeta, Grass, Code, Helium, all launching their own network extensions. And I think there's really three reasons that apps want to inevitably launch their own L2s.
00:01:44.021 - 00:02:47.920, Speaker B: The first is to control greater economics and greater value capture. By owning your own block space and controlling the sequencer, you can capture not only your traditional app revenue, but also you can capture revenue that your app facilitates as part of that ecosystem. This has obviously been very profitable for Coinbase and Base, as well as general purpose rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism. The second core reason is that apps want to control and customize their own block space. By controlling your own block space, you can have custom execution environments, you can have additional usability features like gas abstraction, and then you can also get access to cheaper block space so you're not competing on the global state layer and higher throughput if you need it. And then the last reason is that Solana is obviously a global state machine that has been quite successful and that success in demand for block space will naturally exceed supply and push new applications to launch their own L2s rather than launch on mainnet. And even though Solana has been incredibly successful, its TPS is around 3,000 today.
00:02:47.920 - 00:03:19.749, Speaker B: For context, global credit card payments are around 22,000 per second. And so even just to put credit card payments on chain would be a magnitude increase in Salon as tps. When you start to factor in other applications Like Defi. It obviously becomes too much, and that's going to push other apps to launch. Ronald Twos. The last thing I'd say is earlier today I saw just the opening and president of Slana Foundation, Lily was saying that we're rationalists, not maximalists. And apps already see the reality of today.
00:03:19.749 - 00:03:28.065, Speaker B: They want to own their own economics, they want to own their own block space. The rational take is that the future of Solana is modular, and that is a bright future.
00:03:28.725 - 00:03:32.287, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay, Ben.
00:03:32.431 - 00:04:32.709, Speaker C: Yeah. I think that's some fantastic points here. I don't know, I would like to just open it up with a few spicy point of views here, because I think that basically, if you're choosing to build your own app chain, I really think it's kind of like you're looking to basically go on an island and build by yourself, and that one of the things you have to understand is being on a thriving ecosystem. There is a lot of power in being able to integrate, compose and work together with other projects to grow your user base, grow alliances and other partners in the ecosystem, and sort of like build a bigger mission together than it is to then go on your own island and build by yourself.
00:04:32.877 - 00:04:33.229, Speaker D: Right?
00:04:33.277 - 00:04:36.685, Speaker C: Because there's a lot you have to build before you can even attract people.
00:04:36.805 - 00:04:37.465, Speaker D: Right?
00:04:37.845 - 00:04:54.047, Speaker C: And I kind of feel like fundamentally underneath all of this, there's this kind of builder attitude or expectation. Like, I see a lot of problems here and I want to just go fix it myself.
00:04:54.191 - 00:04:54.927, Speaker D: Right?
00:04:55.111 - 00:05:34.165, Speaker C: And I would like to, like, offer up a different perspective in suggesting that instead of, you know, it's much easier, of course, to just, you know, be that builder who builds everything, but to, like, find ways to work together to build a better solution. And I think oftentimes a lot of these solutions, they're a little bit slower. You know, it takes a little bit more time. Maybe it's a little bit more annoying to work with some other people, right? But, like, you're building value for everyone, right? You're actually, like, lifting all the. Like, lifting everyone together instead of, like, building your own island, you know?
00:05:34.945 - 00:05:39.441, Speaker A: Okay. I don't know. You had a spicier take backstage. I want to hear.
00:05:39.473 - 00:05:58.549, Speaker C: You want me to throw it out there? I'm gonna. Okay, I'm gonna throw it out there. Fine, fine, fine. I'll make a. I'm going to sum it up right. If you're building for your own app chain, you're building for VCs. If you're building versus building for users, right? Because honestly, it's really fucking hard to get users.
00:05:58.637 - 00:05:59.149, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:59.277 - 00:06:07.221, Speaker C: To build, like, to build momentum, to build traction, to find product market fit, to get distribution, to get out there.
00:06:07.293 - 00:06:07.885, Speaker D: Right.
00:06:08.045 - 00:06:16.407, Speaker C: And if you decide to also spend that time building the plumbing, you know, building up the validator network, finding the right incentives.
00:06:16.471 - 00:06:16.839, Speaker D: Right.
00:06:16.927 - 00:06:21.871, Speaker C: How can you succeed in building up your user base? I think it's really hard.
00:06:22.063 - 00:06:23.231, Speaker A: Yeah, Yeah.
00:06:23.263 - 00:06:47.825, Speaker B: I mean, I guess the. I think it's initially like important for applications and the reason they launch on a general purpose chain or on an L2 is to get access so that they're not on an island. But over time, once an app has its own distribution, its own users, its own liquidity, the economic incentives, I think have clearly shown that people are going to be pushed towards launching their own chains.
00:06:49.005 - 00:06:51.109, Speaker A: Do you have an example that you want to.
00:06:51.237 - 00:07:30.885, Speaker B: I mean, so I think like worldcoin on Ethereum is probably a good example where at one point they were 50% of the transactions on optimism. And when you end up being a large percentage of the reason of the economic activity in any given chain, it makes more sense for you to just launch your own chain because then you don't have to compete with the other applications. And maybe with the exception of Defi, I would say, like the composability you get is typically not quite worth the custom customization and cheaper block space that you can get.
00:07:32.465 - 00:08:01.447, Speaker C: I would argue that one of the problems with doing that, even though that's a good example, is that you're then a homogeneous app chain and it's kind of like if you have one species, one disease can just wipe you out. And we've seen this, like a lot of niches on crypto are cyclical, right? NFTs were up, meme coins were down, Meme coins are up, NFTs are down.
00:08:01.591 - 00:08:02.231, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:02.383 - 00:08:15.355, Speaker C: But the nice thing is in a heterogeneous, like diverse network, right, it can thrive even if one sector is down. If you're just one sector, that's your entire chain, you will go down. What do you do?
00:08:16.815 - 00:09:00.053, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think you're definitely offering yourself. With greater risk comes greater reward. And so when I. Obviously a lot of Solana apps have not yet launched their network extensions, I think the reason that they're launching them is either because they want to own their own block space because it's just too expensive to be on mainnet, or they want higher throughput or I think a lot of them just see it as a mechanism by which, like, if you're going to facilitate all this activity, like helium, for example, you don't really need that activity is not super tied to mainnet on Solana. And so you'd rather internalize all of the economic activity that happens through there. And I think that is a driving force.
00:09:00.109 - 00:09:33.363, Speaker A: I mean, in many ways though, Helium is the example of the opposite. They were an app chain and then they became an application on Solana and we don't know where the future holds. But how do you, I mean like worldcoin I think is the great. Is a great example of, you know, of the net of like this evolutionary force and economic forcing function towards app chains. I think Helium is a great example of an app chain is a giant pain in the ass. And like why would you, if you don't have to bear those costs, like, why do it?
00:09:33.459 - 00:09:36.163, Speaker C: Right, Sorry.
00:09:36.219 - 00:09:41.089, Speaker A: So, yeah, just like, you know, you give it an opportunity to kind of.
00:09:41.177 - 00:09:44.113, Speaker C: Oh, comment on like either of those things.
00:09:44.209 - 00:09:48.033, Speaker B: Well, I guess so. Helium is launching a network extension or at least they announced it.
00:09:48.089 - 00:09:48.369, Speaker A: Okay.
00:09:48.417 - 00:10:07.495, Speaker B: I think they, they don't want to be in L1 anymore. I guess they didn't want to be in L1, decided they want to be on mainnet now decide they want to be in L2. But I guess one question I would pose is like, as you see, other apps, especially in particular on Solana, launch these network extensions. Like why do you believe that they're going down that path?
00:10:10.035 - 00:10:41.993, Speaker C: I mean, like, I think it's, there's probably not a universal thing. Like clearly like part of it is trying to solve some of the technical issues, right? Like maybe the, you know, the underlying blockchain isn't ready yet. At the same time, I would say argue like, just because there's problems now, it doesn't mean it doesn't get fixed in the future. You know, it's sort of like Toli's thing. Like, you know, processing speed increases over time and so like we can take advantage of that, like that trend.
00:10:42.129 - 00:10:42.809, Speaker D: Right.
00:10:42.977 - 00:11:02.021, Speaker C: And you know, I like, I believe in that same sort of velocity and improvements on Solana itself. So. But you know, it's hard to say in a specific case like Helium, but maybe sometimes those their technical requirements, they just need it now.
00:11:02.093 - 00:11:02.589, Speaker D: Right.
00:11:02.717 - 00:11:22.225, Speaker C: So they have to make some hard decisions and choices and maybe they found out that integrations or composability with other parts of the ecosystem isn't as valuable to them. So I don't really know.
00:11:23.415 - 00:12:12.485, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's. To me, it seems fairly clear that the trade offs, unless you're in DEFI today are very much worth launching your own chain. Defi is Maybe the exception of a initial pool of capital like that. Liquidity is initially sticky and you want access to it. I think that you can maybe even make the argument though, that if a Defi application on Solana becomes sufficiently large, it has an incentive to capture more of the economic value. You can potentially imagine a world in which a Dex on Solana very much captures its own value through its own fees of its app today. But if it were to launch its own chain and become this global liquidity layer, it would capture all the fees from any economic activity rather than just its own swaps.
00:12:12.485 - 00:12:19.175, Speaker B: I'd be curious if that vision of a future you think over time is probable or even likely.
00:12:19.675 - 00:12:46.797, Speaker C: You know, I can't argue that point. I actually agree with that point. Whether or not that, I mean, I'm a composability maxi. Like, whether or not that's the future I want to see. Like, I actually think that it's a different point. But like, for me, actually one thing that I think we haven't seen that is more composability.
00:12:46.901 - 00:12:47.261, Speaker D: Right.
00:12:47.333 - 00:13:13.689, Speaker C: I see more apps actually centralizing, building more features themselves, more services broadening out. And even if they're not doing Navchain, they're doing that on the L1. Right. So that's something that's been an interesting trend to notice, at least on Solana versus, like people actually building on top of each other. But I hope that changes. Actually, that's.
00:13:13.817 - 00:14:07.797, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope it changes too. I would. I mean, even looking towards Ethereum, you have a lot more applications there trying to internalize and privatize their order flow. Even in the Defi landscape, you know, something like Uniswap X is an off chain order book. And so that of course is like another potential centralizing force or like it blocks some of the composability advantage that you would get from liquidity because it just ends up being owned by one application. I think it then brings up an interesting question of the application versus the protocol and, you know, whether the application itself can drive that protocol to launch its own chain. Or maybe you end up do having protocols that exist across chains and they are relatively composable with one another, but there's some application that just abstracts everything from the user.
00:14:07.901 - 00:14:15.493, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, for me, I guess also for me, I think people lock in on certain beliefs.
00:14:15.589 - 00:14:16.225, Speaker D: Right.
00:14:17.005 - 00:14:24.903, Speaker C: And like, you made a really good point that like, well, you can capture more value, right, if you have your own chain. That's true.
00:14:24.999 - 00:14:25.255, Speaker D: Right.
00:14:25.295 - 00:14:31.151, Speaker C: And so if that's something that you want to do, you can, but I actually don't think that that's the only way to capture more value.
00:14:31.223 - 00:14:42.223, Speaker A: So one thing I would sort of, it's sort of an interesting dilemma and I think it goes to this like, VC versus user question is like, who does the application serve?
00:14:42.319 - 00:14:42.807, Speaker C: Let's go.
00:14:42.871 - 00:14:50.893, Speaker A: Is it the value capture for the token holders or is it the users of the app? And do you think that's a dilemma that matters?
00:14:50.949 - 00:15:20.787, Speaker C: Yeah, it does matter, right, because, okay, here's the argument for users and not valid capture, right, is because you're you if you're thinking long term, right? You need a user base. You need people who love to use a product, who can't stop using your product and they're not there to farm you. They're not there to, you know, like that. I mean, I wouldn't even call some people mercenaries, but some people are just like, they come in, they like the hype, they do a few things and they're out.
00:15:20.851 - 00:15:21.315, Speaker D: Right.
00:15:21.435 - 00:16:06.499, Speaker C: And I think part of the problem that people, you know, if you're working on things, they've a lot. I think there's too much focus on that hype that, you know, like airdrop farming. We're going to get all these people and they're going to turn into users magically and they actually don't. And the harder thing, which takes time, is like, look, how do I have product market fit? Like, how do I get my users to stay? Like, how are they like, engaging? Are they getting real value where they're coming back day after day, you know, and not for some external incentive or some game mechanic, some tokenomic game I'm playing, you know, I mean, that's, you know, and then if you're playing those games, how long are you going to last as an app chain? As an app or whatever?
00:16:06.547 - 00:16:56.415, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, I mean, I definitely, I agree with the vision for crypto where users either get more value from the applications than is extracted from them or at least get value in ways that they don't have to be locked into any particular service. They have more freedom of choice because the end rails end protocols are more permissionless. I still, and this is probably the VC and me, think that the protocols need to capture value in some way just because like, ultimately the protocols and apps that succeed have a very virtuous flywheel where the application provides service on top of the protocol. The protocol itself can be a public good, but the application needs to somehow be able to drive growth as well as like protocol development.
00:16:57.315 - 00:17:06.779, Speaker A: Well, okay, we only got three minutes left. So you want to do like a 90 second sum up and go ask because you got to go first.
00:17:06.867 - 00:17:07.495, Speaker C: Sure.
00:17:09.115 - 00:17:51.155, Speaker B: I think in summary, I very much see a world where Solana, Ethereum, any blockchain, the applications on top are going to continue to get great value from the underlying applications. But eventually over time they will inevitably want to capture more value, own their own block space and launch their own L2, maybe even L1 in some instances. And ultimately I don't think that is bad. I will say for the underlying mainnet, I think that that is good. I think the future is modular and that's ok. It means that the apps and the protocols can both capture a lot of value and more importantly give value to users.
00:17:52.695 - 00:18:17.955, Speaker C: I think what does it say, say about blockchain if apps. The path forward is that apps can't capture value and that you have to be a chain. I think this is a perfect model. You can build an app for a phone and make a lot of money and that makes the ecosystem powerful. If you're saying I have to build the phone to also capture value, but.
00:18:18.035 - 00:18:20.015, Speaker A: Didn'T Solana build a phone?
00:18:23.235 - 00:18:25.315, Speaker C: That's right, that's right, that's right.
00:18:27.695 - 00:18:30.755, Speaker A: All right. I mean we've got like, I mean.
00:18:31.175 - 00:18:46.115, Speaker B: I agree with you. The last thing I'd say is like what's important is not the block space but the value on top. And so a block space I think is quickly becoming a commodity, which is why I think applications will seek to own it.
00:18:46.535 - 00:18:55.351, Speaker A: Okay, why don't we do claps for which side won round of applause? Okay. From the audience, do a little interactive.
00:18:55.503 - 00:18:58.115, Speaker B: All right, any last hot takes for you?
00:18:58.415 - 00:19:38.729, Speaker A: Any last hot takes for me? I'm fully on the path that basically like I spent a decade building sovereign chain infrastructure and at this point I'm like everything. Like Solana is doing multi proposer, Solana is doing application specific sequencing. Okay. And network extensions and all of the modular stuff is doing some form of shared security, some form of integrated like shared sequencing based sequencing, whatnot. Okay. Are these things any different from each other at this point? No, they're just like everybody's building the same thing. So it's currently where I'm at, but we've got to pick a winner.
00:19:38.729 - 00:19:50.195, Speaker A: So. Okay, who wants to clap for the, for the modular future and the integrated future?
00:19:52.975 - 00:19:54.471, Speaker C: Thank you. All right, thank you.
00:19:54.543 - 00:20:04.111, Speaker A: I think it's very clear the audience is definitely biased, so good job. All right, thank you very much.
00:20:04.263 - 00:20:04.615, Speaker C: Thank you.
