00:00:00.320 - 00:00:20.078, Speaker A: Welcome everybody to this week's Changelog. Today I'm joined by John from developer Relations. And I'm Jonas also from developer relations. And a lot of things have happened this week. The game jam is in full swing. You can see magic block and Lampertao are currently running game Jam. By the time this video comes out it might already be over.
00:00:20.078 - 00:00:53.046, Speaker A: And the upgrade, like the theme of the game jam is upgrade. And it's exciting to see what people build with it. Like they build games in all kind of different engines like in Godot Unity. Unreal phaser flutter. Yeah, it's really nice to see. I'm very excited to see what games will come out of this. And another thing that might have already started while you're watching this video is the Oppos hackathon which is also running by Lampard Dao and also in combination with Helios and Opus stands for only possible on Solana.
00:00:53.046 - 00:00:58.620, Speaker A: And I'm super excited to see what kind of things come out of this. What do you think John?
00:00:58.782 - 00:01:09.280, Speaker B: Yeah, the only possible on Solana Hackathon is very exciting because it's community led. So join the lamp or Dao and have some fun building everybody.
00:01:09.472 - 00:01:11.936, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. And what ads did you see this week?
00:01:12.080 - 00:01:44.024, Speaker B: The next topic is the RFC for the week. This is RFC 20 which is for real world assets security token standard. So currently all metadata on Solana follows the metaplex metadata standard. This is a proposal for a new standard that specifically focuses on security tokens with an emphasis on real estate. If you're interested in real world assets you should check out this RFC and see what content it's proposing and what problem it's solving and contribute to the discussion.
00:01:44.444 - 00:02:37.846, Speaker A: Yeah that sounds really interesting. Yeah another standard for metadata. That sounds very interesting. I will definitely read through it and especially through the comments. Then another nice thing which I also noticed while developing last week is that deploying programs with CLI version 116 is quite slow and there's fix about it on the way. So the reason for it was actually that all the transactions to upload this program it's 1000 kilobyte at a time, 1 time and they are all sent at the same time and at some point the block hash has expired and then it becomes slower and they need to retry and yeah there's another version, another possibility how these can be uploaded now and it was merged two days ago so I'm very excited to see this. Someone wrote that they uploaded a 9.5
00:02:37.846 - 00:02:48.074, Speaker A: megabyte contract to Testnet and previously it wasn't possible. And now it's working very quickly. And then there was the boot camp released, right, John?
00:02:48.424 - 00:03:10.884, Speaker B: Yeah. The rest of the Solana foundation developer relations team recently built out this pirate themed Solana bootcamp seven series. It's a crash course on how to build on Solana. You go over everything from your client to programs to building a pirate game in the end, where Jonas shows you how to build the games on Solana.
00:03:11.344 - 00:03:49.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember it was lots of fun being with all the people together in New York and then building this game and having a big sea battle in the end. So, yeah, check it out. Look through the videos, check out this. Everything is open source, of course, so you can just deploy it yourself. And it's a good resource, especially when you want to build a game or staking of tokens or there's some defi stuff in there, some Solana pay, some clockwork oracles. So it has definitely lots of information in it. And then a little last thing that's commit that I saw here is that soon some old cache directories will be deleted automatically on the nodes.
00:03:49.854 - 00:04:02.030, Speaker A: So the node operators. If you wonder why you suddenly have a bit more memory, this is the reason. Just don't you wonder. I'm very excited for the week. What do you think, John? Some last words?
00:04:02.222 - 00:04:10.834, Speaker B: That wraps it up for this week's changelog. Thanks for joining us, everybody. And remember to register and join the only possible on Solana Hackathon.
00:04:11.534 - 00:04:14.526, Speaker A: Yeah, very excited about it. See you next week, everybody. Bye.
