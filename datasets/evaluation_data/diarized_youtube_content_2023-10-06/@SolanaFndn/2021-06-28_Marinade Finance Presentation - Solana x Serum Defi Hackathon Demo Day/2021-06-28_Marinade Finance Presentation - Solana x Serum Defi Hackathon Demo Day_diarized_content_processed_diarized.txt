00:00:00.520 - 00:00:06.422, Speaker A: All right, guys, we're now live with Michael, the founder of Marinade Finance. Welcome, Michael.
00:00:06.598 - 00:00:08.198, Speaker B: Hi. Thank you. Thanks for having me.
00:00:08.246 - 00:00:15.674, Speaker A: We're now live with Michael. Yep, no problem. Go for it. Finance. Welcome, Michael. Oh, I can actually hear there's an echo.
00:00:16.134 - 00:00:34.960, Speaker B: Yeah, got it. Now it should be buried. I'll find out. All right. Okay. So, hi, I'm Michael, and I'm joined here, actually, in the chat by another co founders, Lucio and Marco. So feel free to chat with them too, as well.
00:00:34.960 - 00:01:11.196, Speaker B: And together with another contributors, we're working on marinate finance. Right. So let me tell you a quick story about it. In short, Marinate is a liquid staking platform built on the Solana network. And first of all, quick background story, why we decided to work in this space. And what are the main benefits of liquid staking? So, censorship, resistance, that's considered to be one of the main propositions of blockchain networks. And the idea is that no nation corporation or third party has the power to control who can transact or store their value on the network.
00:01:11.196 - 00:01:58.214, Speaker B: Right? And in the Solana network, there are 613 validators where currently top 16 validators have enough staking power to be able to hold the network. And we found this is a problem from a security perspective. Next adoption, we believe that to onboard the next 1 billion people to crypto. And before making it to the moon, the end user experience must improve in general. And seamless, well designed staking, among other things, will play a big part in this. And finally, our idea is that Solana ecosystem can really thrive. And boom, if we can connect the dots and make all different parts of the ecosystem work together.
00:01:58.214 - 00:02:58.736, Speaker B: At this point, there are more than 300 million sol tokens locked in staking. Which brings us to what's so interesting about liquid staking. So as a sole token holder seeking some rewards, you're basically going to ask yourself this question, am I going to lock my sold tokens to unstaking rewards, or am I going to deposit in a lending platform or liquidity pool to farm and earn rewards this way? You know, imagine a world where you can do both, where marinade helps to unlock hundreds of million sold tokens locked in staking. And that's a true power of liquid staking. And what's more, there is this warm up period and cooldown period about three days on Solana when it comes to staking. So that means that you have to wait this warm up period until you get your stake activated and start receiving first rewards. And when you decide to unstake you have to wait for that cooldown period as well before you're free to move your tokens as you like.
00:02:58.736 - 00:03:43.514, Speaker B: Now, with marinate liquid staking, you can forget about these lockup periods so you can start collecting rewards the very moment you stake. And you're free to unstake at any time you want without a waiting period. And when you stake with marinade, you just click a button and that's it. You don't have to create stake accounts, choose from 600 validators who's the right to delegate to monitor their performance, and rebalance delegations if needed. And this is all done behind the seats. It just works. And in the recent Defi hackathon hosted by Solana and serum in February this year, we were able to deliver proof of concept of our solution.
00:03:43.514 - 00:04:20.886, Speaker B: Since then, we found another teams working on liquid staking for Solana as well. And quite surprisingly, we decided to join forces rather than to compete against each other with this improved team. Then we were able to revisit almost every part of initial system architecture and made it quite robust. And just two weeks ago, we successfully launched a Devnet version of marinade, so anybody can test it out with test tokens. Let me show you real quick how it works. It will be better to show you this demo. So first of all, you go to our landing page and you hit that stake button.
00:04:20.886 - 00:04:50.014, Speaker B: Stake Sol. And we have to connect first to the wallet. And we are using solid here. But you can use any any wallet on the list and once connected, to make it easier to test for you. We prepared an error button to get ten test solves to play with, and now you're free to use it in the app. Let's first start by adding some Sol tokens into liquidity pool. By doing that, you will act as a liquidity provider and get a share of a fee when other people make transactions with this pool.
00:04:50.014 - 00:05:15.714, Speaker B: And that's all set now. So let's move to staking. You simply pick the amount of Sol tokens you want to stake and hit that stake button. And let me pause here, because if you never tried to send transactions on Solana blockchain, brace yourself because this is going to be quick. You just click the approve button. That's it. You just staked five Sol with marinate and got five St Sol back in return for that.
00:05:15.714 - 00:05:44.864, Speaker B: And these St Sol tokens account for your deposited Sol. But all the future staking rewards. If you ever want to unstake and get your Sol tokens back, it's a matter of few clicks and you're done again. And if you want, you can also check the transaction details using Solana block Explorer and we'll see that in a matter of few seconds. The confirmation status moves from confirmed to finalized. Yep, that's it.
00:05:45.244 - 00:05:56.104, Speaker A: I'd love to hear a little bit more sure. Around what you can do with these ST sold tokens, because I think that's the really interesting part with this. Right. Would you mind interoperability that this allows?
00:05:56.444 - 00:06:17.322, Speaker B: Sure. Getting right at it. Right at it. So we are actually getting at it with our next steps. So like what we planning to do? Like one huge step of this is the ecosystem integrations. So to make it like by order, we are starting. Like the obvious next step is to have finished our mvp on the Devnet.
00:06:17.322 - 00:06:57.044, Speaker B: That means having all the advanced options when it comes to staking. The next stop is domain launch, when we already started to work on a contract audit and would like to bring it to Mainnet as soon as possible. And now to the question, right, because the ST Sol, it'll play like a key part in our success. I would say, like development of ecosystem integrations. That will be it for St Sol. So we want to make sure that you can use your ST Sol in all the Solana defi world. For example, imagine farming on radium by putting in St Sol token instead of sol.
00:06:57.044 - 00:07:36.510, Speaker B: And this way you'll be able to get staking rewards and collect farming rewards together at the same time, if you get me. So that's one idea how you can really use it in these liquidity pools. Also, you might be able to use it, for example, as a collateral and borrow against it. So everywhere you see in the defi ecosystem right now within Solana, where you can use Sol tokens, it doesn't make sense to use Sol tokens anymore because you can use SD Sol and get staking and these other rewards at the same time. Does it, does it make sense? Tristan? Tristan, you there?
00:07:36.662 - 00:07:46.766, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, I gave a thumbs up. It makes perfect sense. I think there's so many different functionalities for this, and it's the same as intro bearing tokens that we see on Ethereum right now. Like compound USDT and others of that nature.
00:07:46.830 - 00:07:47.478, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:07:47.606 - 00:08:01.678, Speaker A: Really glad to see them come to the Solana ecosystem. And I think that the cool thing here that may be a bit of an issue on Ethereum, except for with flash loans, is that since transactions times are so short, it's a lot easier to liquidate these if you're using them in collateral sensitive situations.
00:08:01.846 - 00:08:37.174, Speaker B: Right, right, right, exactly, exactly. So you know, we have like so much ideas where to go from here actually. But our goal is to build marinade for them together with our community, which been fantastic so far. And as we are not funded by or we are independent of any VC fund, any investor or validator group. So we just want to build this, you know, with the community. And if you want, please test us out at Marinade Finance. And we are on Twitter too, so if you are as well, you can share this readymade tweet by visiting link tiny CC.
00:08:37.174 - 00:09:07.794, Speaker B: So sharing progress on medium and I suggest that you join our discord for latest announcements. Yeah, so I wanted to thank everybody who already tried our Devnet version. The feedback from all the people has been amazing so far and we are also looking for fantastic builders to join marinade and ecosystem partners. So, you know, feel free to reach to out to us on discord and happy staking for sure.
00:09:08.334 - 00:09:17.754, Speaker A: Thanks, Michael. Thanks for joining. We really appreciate it. Now, for all the listeners, we're going to go to break for a second, maybe a minute or two and let the psy option guys come on up.
00:09:18.854 - 00:09:19.454, Speaker B: Have a good one.
