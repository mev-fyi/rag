00:00:03.920 - 00:00:36.008, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much, everyone, for being here. We have a very spicy and interesting panel planned. So I'll go through, I'll introduce our guests, and then we'll just get right into it. There's a lot to talk about in crypto policy. We'll start off right next to me with Carol House. Carol recently left the White House, where she worked on President Biden's executive order on digital assets and was formerly of the US counterterrorism ransomware campaign. She's currently an executive residence at a venture capital fund focused on national security.
00:00:36.008 - 00:01:07.944, Speaker A: She's super deep on these issues. Next to her, we have Marina. Marina Markozzyk is the founder and director of the European Crypto Initiative. They're the leading organization working on crypto issues in Europe, going to Brussels all the time. Next to her is the american version Miller, founding director of the Defi Education Fund, one of the leading organizations on behalf of DeFi in the United States. So these are the guys literally going to Capitol Hill, opening up a laptop, and showing people what a Dex is. And then finally, we have Neeraj.
00:01:07.944 - 00:01:46.604, Speaker A: Neeraj is the director of communications at Coin center, or as he sometimes called their Twitter guy. Coin center is a nonprofit think tank, an advocacy group dedicated to defending the rights of individuals to build on and use open source cryptocurrency networks. So we got a broad spectrum here, and we're going to kick it off. First, I'll say something which is, I understand this is a global audience. We're going to focus specifically today on us and european crypto policy. Just because crypto policy is so broad, we have to start somewhere. So we'll start off talking about a piece of legislation that is getting a big name in Washington, DC right now called the DCCPA.
00:01:46.604 - 00:01:58.408, Speaker A: If you've been tracking Twitter controversy, maybe between SBF and Eric Voorhees, they're all talking about the DCCPA. This is a piece of legislation that is pending. So why don't we kick it off at Miller? What's the DCCPA?
00:01:58.536 - 00:02:48.140, Speaker B: Sure. So, overall, the DCCPA, its goal is to regulate the crypto spot markets. What I mean by that, you can generally think of custodial exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken. They have customers and exchange digital assets for other digital assets or fiat currencies on behalf of their customers. The DCCPA wants to regulate those spot markets generally. And I think that there's a uncontroversial and then controversial parts of those bills. This bill, excuse me, the c five portion, I think, is less controversial than the DeFi portion, what the DCCPA does is it creates a registration and regulatory framework for.
00:02:48.140 - 00:03:51.374, Speaker B: For CFI. And the issue with the bill, from my perspective right now, is that it intends to apply those CFI regulations to DeFi protocols and market participants in a uniform way. So, depending on how you read it, a Dex protocol, for example, would be captured as a trading facility and would be required to register with a us regulator and implement a bunch of policies that are designed for c five businesses, which is impossible to do if we're talking about a dex protocol or a lending protocol, what have you. So, the general issue with the bill is that while it tries to regulate the spot markets, it doesn't distinguish between C five spot markets and deFi spot markets, and therefore, in my opinion, is unworkable from the deFi ecosystem's perspective.
00:03:51.714 - 00:04:02.058, Speaker A: So let's take a step back. What the hell does the SEC and CFTC have to do with everything? Why are we always talking about these guys as the regulators for crypto? Neeraj, do you want to take a crack at that?
00:04:02.226 - 00:04:37.626, Speaker C: Yeah. So cryptocurrency has been used a lot to do things that are typically regulated in the traditional financial world. And of particular interest to the SEC is the use of cryptocurrency for things like capital formation, which is regulated pretty heavily. The ICO boom, we all remember that. So the SEC believes, and I think many legal analysts would agree, that quite a lot of cryptocurrencies that are out there today would fall under the category of security, and most typically an unregistered security. And that would put it under the remit of the. The SEC.
00:04:37.626 - 00:05:15.788, Speaker C: And I think that if a cryptocurrency is treated as a security, it would be very difficult for it to be traded in a crypto native way. Being a user would be essentially impossible. So that's why the SEC has taken great interest in this. Meanwhile, we do know that some cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether and those like it, do not necessarily meet the definitions of a security. They kind of exist in the world as a nation native Internet protocol that is not really owned or controlled by anybody. So that makes the token itself a lot more like a commodity. So we feel the CFTC would have jurisdiction over that.
00:05:15.788 - 00:05:26.104, Speaker C: And this is all based on guidance. It's not really codified in law. And that is why there's a little bit of jockeying happening for edge cases. Who's in charge?
00:05:26.684 - 00:05:48.332, Speaker A: And so coin center is really involved at a. On a lot of these issues. And going to the hill and lobbying on behalf of specific ideas. And so when you're talking about something like DeFi, what are you willing to compromise when you go into those negotiations, or you go into those sort of the negotiations about bills and what are you willing to give on? How do you decide that? Prioritization.
00:05:48.468 - 00:06:49.722, Speaker C: So we prioritize protecting the developers of these protocols. In particular, if you're a developer who simply publishes code, you should not be subject to any type of registration requirement or really any further regulatory burden, because publishing code alone is speech. Now, if you start doing things like promoting use of this particular code or market making and sort of more sophisticated financial elements, then that goes beyond simply publishing code. Another area where we would draw a line is validating transactions or block producing, because that, let's say a illicit transaction, is validated by your node. All you've done is relay information. You haven't actually made the transaction, so you should not be held responsible for that transaction. And finally, somebody who's trading on their own account, you know, just me buying, I don't know, ETH on uniswap or whatever, or sold.
00:06:49.722 - 00:06:53.894, Speaker C: I should not be treated as some type of dealer or anything like that.
00:06:55.314 - 00:07:14.962, Speaker A: Carol, you spent the first part of your career in the US government. You understand these issues almost as well as anybody who works in the entire us government. When you hear about the DCCPA and maybe the lines that folks like Neeraj and Miller are trying to draw, what's your reaction? Where would you draw the line? As someone who appreciates crypto, but as.
00:07:14.978 - 00:07:34.234, Speaker D: A different perspective, yeah, I really appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into drafting the DCCPA. Optimally, in a world, I would prefer that all legislation be technology neutral, which most CFTC, SEC, SEC, bank Secrecy act, other legislation tends to be tech neutral. And I think that's the best way to future proof.
00:07:34.314 - 00:07:35.994, Speaker A: What does it mean to be tech neutral? Great.
00:07:36.034 - 00:08:21.660, Speaker D: So not really. Not define something based on the technology or even being digital or electronic in nature, but instead defining it by a type of activity. Like think about our authorities for money transmission. Our regulations don't say electronic, they don't say physical. They just say accepting and transmitting value that substitutes for currency, or currency or funds. So that's an example of where I think that legislation is best focused to be focused on the economic substance of what is happening and defining the kinds of activities and features that are existent. But understanding that that's also not likely right now with crypto legislation, given the current state of the bills that I've seen, I think that the DCCPA is at least as tech neutral as I've seen any of the bills.
00:08:21.660 - 00:08:56.480, Speaker D: It doesn't rely on specific types of distributed ledger technologies in a good and helpful way. So I'm excited about it. I think that my feelings towards it echo a lot of what Benham said very recently in his testimony, I think in September. Otherwise, I do think that there's that one key area that it doesn't provide clarity on which it just may not be scoped to do so, is providing clarity on when is something a commodity. That's really the key issue that I've seen industry seeking clarity on, and maybe they're looking to the executive branch to be able to provide that clarity, and the hill may not be taking that up.
00:08:56.552 - 00:09:06.728, Speaker A: That's a really good jumping off point. Miller, I know you and I have talked about how we think about distinguishing between a security and commodity. What principle should underlie that framework? Is that even the right framework?
00:09:06.856 - 00:09:46.386, Speaker B: Yeah. I have one point on the tech neutrality issue. I completely agree with you that I think regulation should be tech neutral. And there's this principle about same activity, same risk, same rules in financial regulation that people talk about a lot. But I think there's some nuance there that sometimes people miss, which is that if an activity is being effectuated in a different way, it can't necessarily be regulated in the same way. A simple, very oversimplified analogy I use is transportation services like airplanes versus trains. We want everybody to get from point a to point b in a safe way.
00:09:46.386 - 00:10:31.554, Speaker B: But obviously, it's a very good thing we don't apply the exact same rules to both trains and airplanes to have the same outcome. So I think that it's a hard needle to thread, because if you have some prescriptive portions of a bill, like in DCCPA, you can ruin that tech neutral principle, for example, by requiring trading facilities to run a central limit order book. So I think that the same rules. Excuse me, same activities, same rules, same risks. Principle is. It's different based on who you ask, I guess I'll say. And then, Amir, I completely.
00:10:31.554 - 00:11:32.276, Speaker B: You know, the framing about a security versus commodity, in my mind, is a distraction in a lot of ways. I think that there's nothing inherently wrong with being a security. I think if we can accomplish the goals of the regulation generally, protecting consumers, preventing illicit finance, et cetera, in a way that allows the technology to remain functionally similar or protects the foundational principles of peer to peer markets and crypto markets, then the regulatory classification shouldn't be relevant. Obviously, that's not the case today because we live in a world with pretty prescriptive regulations. And I think, Niraj, you're right that if you are captured as a security today, the problem is not that you're a security. The problem is that there's no way to comply with the regulations as, as developed for traditional financial markets.
00:11:32.340 - 00:11:50.544, Speaker C: Yeah. Part of being the issue of a security means that you have to file reports with the SEC. And for a network like Solana probably, and ether and others, there is nobody who has the visibility and sort of control of the network to make those types of declarations. And it just kind of doesn't really fit.
00:11:52.204 - 00:12:14.844, Speaker A: Marina. So Europe recently passed a piece of legislation called Mica that deals with this issue in a really different way. It's really striking to me when you go around the world and talk about SEC, CFTC, or some people talk about the Howey test, they're like, why does the United States deal with it this way? So one, two sentences, what is Mika? And then two, how does it deal with this issue around how you classify digital assets?
00:12:15.304 - 00:12:57.062, Speaker E: Yes. So Mika is the marketing group of assets regulation and has been finalized recently. We had the first draft two years ago in 2020, and it took us two years to finalize it. Just yesterday, we got the news that the publication in the official journal of the European Union is going to be delayed by another two months. And some of the voting is linked to that. So we expect it to be applicable in 2024, somehow in the other part of 2024. So if you think about it, it took us four years to basically write this very comprehensive piece of regulation.
00:12:57.062 - 00:14:06.082, Speaker E: But it is very important because it was the first one in the EU and globally that basically regulates crypto assets, issuance and service providers in a very broad way. So what it defines is, what are the obligations of the issuers of crypto asset, crypto assets being representation of assets or rights on the DLT, on blockchain. So basically, everyone that wants to issue a crypto asset, they will need to comply with Mica, write a white paper, and also, in a way, talk to their national competent authorities about that. And there's the other part that regulates crypto as a service providers, such as exchanges, custodians, and those also have quite restrictive obligations under Mica. But I would say that what is the most important is the regulation around stablecoins. So basically, Mica was written because of, in a way, as a reaction to Libra or diem, if you remember, in 2019. And again, it took us quite some time to kind of decide how to regulate stablecoins.
00:14:06.082 - 00:15:06.804, Speaker E: But now we have a comprehensive regulation on stablecoins, which in a way sets obligations on reserves and licenses. But what it says in general is that decentralized stablecoins are prohibited in Europe. And I would say that when I take a look at what's happening in the US and think about the future global regulation of crypto assets, it's going to vary, fragmented, jurisdiction specific. And in this case, I think that maybe the difference between the US and the EU is that securities or financial instruments, as we call them in Europe, are regulated already with a directive, with the Mifid directive, and they're not regulated by Mika. So Mika really is talking about this new asset, new crypto assets, that is completely a new class. And I would say that would resemble more the understanding of a utility token that we have from the US.
00:15:07.384 - 00:15:16.848, Speaker A: Got it. So Mika basically says we have this thing called the security. Let's create a new category for digital assets and work forward from there. Is that right?
00:15:16.936 - 00:15:17.440, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:15:17.552 - 00:15:29.488, Speaker A: So what some people say in the US is, man, we're so behind Europe. Europe has Mica. We need to catch up. Do you agree with that, anyone? Miller, do you agree with that?
00:15:29.576 - 00:15:43.400, Speaker B: I don't agree with that. I think, of course, I am a believer that DeFi will revolutionize economic exchange in the future, and I think it's in the US's interest to get it right.
00:15:43.592 - 00:15:44.272, Speaker A: Carol?
00:15:44.368 - 00:16:37.542, Speaker D: Yeah, I typically don't agree with that criticism. There definitely are things that Mika does, certainly that the US doesn't have, like one established federal requirement and a framework that is specific to DLT based assets. Instead, our economic principles and technology neutral based framework has instead regulated this activity where when what was conducted was the same economic substance and functionally the same activity that had previously been done. For example, money transmission has been regulated in the US involving cryptocurrency since at least 2011. And then you have securities laws and commodity laws that have covered them as well when the asset that's being offered or being traded meets the definitions and the prescriptions of those laws. So I'd say that the US framework is very complex, and I really appreciate the point on the fragmented financial system. I'm not saying that the US regulatory system is not fragmented.
00:16:37.542 - 00:17:04.686, Speaker D: I just think it's as fragmented in crypto as it is in traditional finance, traditional financial regulation. I think r1 distinction, though, is the stablecoin piece. While there are optional ways to try to get that regulation through, getting an OCC fintech charter or working with the states, in the United States to get a bank charter, there's not an established mandatory requirement as an issuer or administrator of a stablecoin outside of anti money laundering at the federal level.
00:17:04.870 - 00:17:05.710, Speaker A: Got it.
00:17:05.862 - 00:17:07.158, Speaker E: If I may, please.
00:17:07.206 - 00:17:07.414, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:07.454 - 00:17:38.204, Speaker E: Thank you. So I think one of the important things of Mika is that it doesn't regulate deFi, it doesn't regulate decentralized entities, at least in very general terms. And what is maybe comparing to what you said, it is a regulation, which means that in Europe, it's going to be directly applicable and identical in all the member states, which in a way is very positive. If anyone would like to access the european market, they will have the same rules all over all the member states.
00:17:39.164 - 00:17:40.156, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah.
00:17:40.220 - 00:18:21.628, Speaker D: If it's okay, at one point I wanted to bring up. Cause I know that Neeraj spoke about it earlier about validators. I'll say in the United States, they're not covered as financial institutions under regulations like SEC and CFTC, but there are regulations like IIPA, which is the fundamental legislative authorities underneath our sanctions regime, where it's possible that validators that are us persons, if they are validating transactions, going to designated persons under strict liability standards, it's possible that there's sanctions implications there. So given that sometimes minors and validators are viewed as part of that DeFi community, I just wanted to mention that the regulatory framework expands beyond just the financial institution requirements.
00:18:21.716 - 00:18:47.432, Speaker A: Carol. Dropping bombs, talking about sanctioning validators. Okay, so this is a good time for us to move on to the second part of the discussion, which has to do with tornado cash and sanctions more broadly. Carol, you actually were in the US government and I think worked on the tornado cash decision. I know you can't comment on directly. I really thank you for being here and commenting sort of about the sanctioning process more broadly. And I want to take a second and be in your shoes.
00:18:47.432 - 00:19:16.764, Speaker A: What happens when the United States government is choosing to sanction anything? And actually, I want to take a step back and make sure that we sort of set the ground, which is. Or set the foundation, which is. In August, the United States Department of Treasury sanctioned virtual currency mixer, tornado cash. And this was a controversial decision for many in the crypto community. So if you haven't heard about that, we'll get into it. But that's sort of the background of why this is so relevant. So what does it look like when the United States government sanctions anyone?
00:19:16.924 - 00:19:56.824, Speaker D: Yeah. So first I'll say that OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control inside of the US treasury, fully administers the sanctions regime under authorities that are granted from the president. So all of that is administered by OfAC. OFAC makes those decisions, decisions under the Department of the treasury. So all those decision making authorities exist there. Of course, those sanctions regimes are administered as a part of a broader community in the executive branch as well as the legislative branch. At the time of some of the designations involving North Korea's hack of the Axie infinity platform and some other illicit activities, I was at the National Security Council.
00:19:56.824 - 00:21:17.198, Speaker D: The NSC is a critical partner with OFAC and Treasury, as is the Department of State and the Department of Justice and even the regulators. So the point of our sanctions regimes in the United States is to try to impose costs on adversaries and to try to drive a change in strategic behavior in order to reduce or mitigate a threat to us national security or economy or foreign policy objectives in the light of those types of threats as they come up, like what you see with Russia's original invasion into Ukraine, and then there are continued unprovoked acts of aggression there. That's why the US and many of our international partners brought on another tranche of sanctions, of sanctions in 2022. We also have sanctions against Iran, against North Korea jurisdictionally, and then we also bring specifically sanctions against particular actors under programs like our cyber sanctions program. So in light of all of those, based on the threats that they pose and discussions across the national security community, there's discussions about, like, what entities should be specifically designated underneath those particular authorities. So, and I'll also just highlight that I don't speak for the administration anymore, and I'm not a lawyer, so anything that I talk about on sanctions, on sanctions, is just the view from a former Fed.
00:21:17.286 - 00:21:38.598, Speaker A: This isn't legal advice. So basically, State Department, Department of Defense, the NSC, a bunch of folks who are involved get together, sort of advise OFAC on who they should designate as a sanctioned entity, and OFAC administers the sanction and makes the final decision and the enforcement. Neeraj, why is cointender suing the US government?
00:21:38.726 - 00:22:31.760, Speaker C: Yeah, so, as Amira mentioned, the sanction of tornado cash was a huge moment for the cryptocurrency community. It's the first time that a smart contract was itself sanctioned rather than some sort of foreign entity. And coin center immediately filed a lawsuit. Coinbase also, I think, funded a lawsuit, basically both making roughly the same argument that the authority that has been extended by Congress to the Treasury Department to, to execute sanctions stops just short of sanctioning an unowned piece of the Internet like tornado cash. So previously there have been sanctions against mixers like blender IO, which are companies. There was a person, a server in the middle that took a cut and all the funds flowed into the one server and then back out. So that is a clear entity.
00:22:31.760 - 00:23:03.484, Speaker C: The tornado cash. Smart contract. Nobody has any control over it. The actual developers of tornado cash sort of set it loose in the world and it simply is a tool that anyone can use for their own privacy. So our lawsuit makes this sort of very technical, wonkish policy argument that the government did not actually have the authority to sanction tornado cash because it is not itself a foreign person or a foreign entity simply is a tool that exists on the Internet.
00:23:04.424 - 00:23:15.616, Speaker A: Got it. So you said or tornado cash said tornado cash isn't an entity and the US government can only sanction entities and individuals. Yes, Carol, what does the US government consider an entity or individual?
00:23:15.720 - 00:24:27.004, Speaker D: Great. And again, not commenting at all on this particular case. I'll say that the definitions for person and entity differ based on the specific regulatory authority or statutory authority that's being administered. You have different definitions for person under IPA, for sanctions, under CFTC requirements, like you saw in the recent action against a DAO that CFTC announced and then also under the Bank Secrecy act. But most of them have some pretty common parallels in that the definition for person is typically an individual or an entity, then unpacked underneath what is an entity? There's a list of different things which could be partnerships, it could be joint ventures, it could be trusts, it can be corporations, it can also be organizations, specifically in the Bank Secrecy act. It even states unincorporated organizations. So I think you've seen the government take interpretations that entities that may not exist as legal registered corporations, like for example in CFTC's recent Dow action, that they view this to be an unincorporated association because of its working together in mutual partnership towards a common objective, an association that these folks are participating in driving towards a common objective.
00:24:27.004 - 00:24:50.800, Speaker D: I know that I've seen the community often really focus on the first letter endow decentralized, and therefore that means that we're not an entity to be regulated. I would encourage the sector to think that I would expect that the government would look at the third letter endow organization, which is present in every single definition of person that I've spoken about here, and I'm sure many others underneath us authorities.
00:24:50.992 - 00:24:52.192, Speaker A: Anyone respond?
00:24:52.368 - 00:25:16.816, Speaker B: I think that the Uki Dao action is different than the tornado cash action from that perspective for a couple of reasons. Number one, the Treasury Department didn't sanction the token holders. The DAO itself, number one. And I think number two, to Niraj's point, the tornado cash smart contracts will exist in their current form as long as the Ethereum blockchain is wrapped.
00:25:16.840 - 00:25:22.866, Speaker C: The tornado cash Dao does exist, but it does not have any control over the particular smart contract that was sanctioned.
00:25:22.970 - 00:25:25.474, Speaker B: Exactly. Several smart contracts that were sanctioned.
00:25:25.514 - 00:25:25.858, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:25.946 - 00:26:06.774, Speaker B: And I think from a more macro perspective, it's important to remember that sanctions are designed to change the behavior of foreign nationals in some way that the US government finds beneficial. And if you have an immutable smart contract, which is literally impossible to change, the behavior of the effect of the tornado cash smart contract sanctions was to impart, without due process, civil and criminal liability on us citizens. And if there's no hope of the goal of sanctions being achieved, I think that is a misguided policy choice.
00:26:08.074 - 00:26:10.050, Speaker A: Niraj, like, you look like you're about to say something.
00:26:10.122 - 00:26:38.736, Speaker C: I was thinking about how to say it. So. Also, it's worth noting that the most users of the tornado cash smart contract were not using it for listed activity. And it's not illegal for me to deposit my own money into tornado to break the chain of custody because someone on Twitter is sneaking on what nfts I'm buying and lost money on. Right. So I don't want to. If I want to use that tool, I am in no way doing business with a foreign national or anyone who might be sanctioned.
00:26:38.736 - 00:26:41.534, Speaker C: It's simply a privacy tool for my own use.
00:26:41.994 - 00:27:01.334, Speaker B: That's another good point. It's when you deposit your assets into this tornado cash smart contracts, when they're eventually pulled out, they're the exact same assets. You're not exchanging them with a potentially foreign sanctioned entity, what have you. So I think there are several unique factors in this instance.
00:27:01.634 - 00:27:08.148, Speaker A: Carol, I want to give you a chance to respond and then we could talk about Europe for a second. But anything that you want to say that's responding or too close to home.
00:27:08.276 - 00:28:15.026, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll, again, not specifically speaking to this action, just because it all occurred while I was still a part of the government. So I'll highlight that part of the sanctions process that is accounted for is thinking about how do we mitigate potential unintended consequences for humanitarian and other purposes. So there are licensing regimes and other ways that people can apply to be able to engage, engage in such transactions. Since OFAC decided to designate this entity, I think would totally defer to them. I think that's probably implicated in the questions that I know have been asked here about how it is that they're determining that there was an entity here and not just something that's software. But I just wanted to highlight that there are broader considerations and processes to be able to engage more fully and IPA authorities, even underneath the authorities to the president, there's a specific carve out for things that are like telegraphic communications that do not involve a transfer of value. I think it's that value transfer piece that obviously most sanctions regimes are totally.
00:28:15.050 - 00:28:49.354, Speaker C: Founded upon to that .1 of the co plaintiffs in our lawsuit, us as well. So we receive donations through tornado cash. Coin center is a nonprofit funded by the community. Thank you. And so we do not want to be in a position where we have to report on our donors or have our donors revealed if they want to stay private to make the political speech donation, that is a donation to coin center, they should be allowed to. Also, there's a group that is sending funds to Ukraine and they don't, you know, they fear being targeted by the Russians for this action.
00:28:49.354 - 00:28:53.964, Speaker C: So they also were using tornado cash. So there are humanitarian uses for this.
00:28:54.544 - 00:29:06.656, Speaker A: So that actually segues nicely into my next question, which is like, Marina, I want to bring in the conversation here. Did Tornado cash have any impact on the situation in Europe? What did you see as the fallout from that locally?
00:29:06.840 - 00:29:21.582, Speaker E: That's a very interesting question because I think that a lot of Europeans might not be aware of potentially being a us person. So that's the first thing. It can be quite complicated to understand if you are or not.
00:29:21.678 - 00:29:24.110, Speaker A: So. Sorry, how is that possible? How would I not know if I'm a us person?
00:29:24.142 - 00:29:38.670, Speaker E: I think just because of, like we heard the definition before. So it's, it's, it's set as individuals but also entities. So what is in a us entity? It can be like a kind of a mix of an entity that might be, some have some elements in the EU and in the US.
00:29:38.742 - 00:29:42.486, Speaker A: So, so if I'm working for an american company or a dow or something like that.
00:29:42.550 - 00:30:29.504, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. And I think this is, this is quite an important first one and then secondly, de facto, it's really hard for the european persons, individuals or entities to use tornado cash right now, although the sanctions were not directed to them just because of course there's no front end anymore, there's no code on GitHub because it was shut down. And also most of the services, different protocols, but also applications. Dapps, they did implement those sanctions in a very general way. So in a way it was not directed to, I would say Europeans, but also the rest of the world. But right now there is an implication to the usage of tornado cash also for those persons.
00:30:31.764 - 00:30:51.724, Speaker A: I want to move on to talking about privacy more generally in web3 so we can talk sort of more broadly. What's the layer at which we should start thinking about privacy in web3? Should it be at the protocol layer? Should it be the validator layer? Should it be at the application layer? What is the right way to think about how you preserve privacy?
00:30:52.944 - 00:31:05.644, Speaker C: Let's jump in. I don't want to dictate where the market should land, but I think that privacy at the protocol layers should be a priority. The less information is leaking, the better.
00:31:06.564 - 00:31:47.484, Speaker B: I agree. I think that one of the primary impediments to broad adoption of blockchains right now is how surveillable they are. And I think that if you're a business, you don't want your competitors seeing every transaction you make being a simple example. And I think the same is true for individuals. It's pretty easy to track people's wallets across black, excuse me, blockchains. And financial privacy is important for a host of reasons, including political donations. So I think that at the base layer of privacy is incorporated, it'll be the best for everybody.
00:31:47.604 - 00:31:50.784, Speaker C: I want to be as private as cash, paper cash.
00:31:51.324 - 00:31:52.824, Speaker A: You're chomping at the bit here.
00:31:53.204 - 00:32:12.172, Speaker E: I would agree that the base layer of neutrality is super important. And of course, maybe add in another european story to this. We are having right now negotiations on the EU level on AML. There is a whole AML package that has been discussed in the parliament at the moment, specifically.
00:32:12.228 - 00:32:13.148, Speaker A: Sorry, what's AML?
00:32:13.236 - 00:33:00.674, Speaker E: Yeah, the anti money laundering regulation right now, specifically in the European Parliament, and some of the rules that are defined in the transfer funds regulation and also in the AMLR will have a very similar effect as the OFAC sanctions specifically on the EU market. And I think that we really, at least right now, we are very actively looking into those regulations and the amendments that have been just issued. And I think that not just by looking into what OFAC does, but looking into what are their new laws that are being discussed at the moment that will have a very similar effect. I think this is also quite important, Carol.
00:33:00.754 - 00:33:54.688, Speaker D: Great. I have so many feelings about privacy in the world of DeFi, and I know that I'm not on exactly the same calibration as the folks on the stage with me, as well as I'm sure many in the room. But first, to help you understand where I come from and where I think a lot in government do basically first, privacy does not mean anonymity. It means the availability of data that can be disclosed or discoverable under certain conditions, permissions and protections. So that's a critical piece, that privacy and anonymity are not the same thing. So I think that there are discussions about what is the amount of data that should be able to be held to be discoverable by whom, under what conditions and protections, and when it should be discoverable by others. But I'll highlight as kind of a call to innovation by the incredible builders that are in this room, because I absolutely believe that technology will solve these policy problems.
00:33:54.688 - 00:35:05.300, Speaker D: The reason why regulators are so concerned about the world of Defi and web, three rails that had traditionally been bifurcated. We've all talked about this forever, the Internet and information transfer, where we like to be able to establish identity and trust ourselves on either side of an information transaction like we can that's available. However, we don't want that. We don't like identity being tied to everything involving information transfer. That makes us feel very like, it makes us very itchy sometimes when we think about identity and information transfer and everything we do on the Internet versus value transfer pipes like fedwire and chips, or Swift, which I know is information transfer, but for a value transfer where we're very used to, to identity being built into cross border transfers and things that unlike, like with cash and crypto, there's distinctions where cash takes time and space and physics to move, and crypto does not. So, and the fact that things are public ledgers is not inevitable, as we've discussed here, that's often viewed as a bug, not a feature of these systems. So, like, even the potential benefit that you get of traceability that you get with crypto that you don't with cash may be going away with the implementation of privacy technologies.
00:35:05.300 - 00:36:03.470, Speaker D: So now you have the same rails that can facilitate information and value transfer simultaneously. And with the right encryption, you can't tell which is happening, an information transfer or a value transfer. This is a very interesting and very tough regulatory problem and technological problem of, like, I don't think that the future of, if it's truly a future of a decentralized financial system, you know, I like intermediaries. I don't keep all my cash in, but who am I to tell you not to keep your cash there in unhosted wallets? I think intermediaries play a critical role with visibility and regulation, but also with reducing friction and providing great higher order developments for consumers. But ultimately, if the future is decentralized, there has to be a discussion about. And there has to be innovation on the policy and the tech side to make sure that appropriate identity is available, discoverable, disclosable. So anyway, I do think that identity is a critical component of the future of DeFi and web3.
00:36:03.542 - 00:36:13.102, Speaker A: So I want to push you a little. So at what layer do you think privacy is important? Or maybe at what layer do you think that there should be? I guess an intermediary? What do we declare? An intermediary.
00:36:13.198 - 00:36:45.178, Speaker D: I mean, I think that it could exist. It could exist at the protocol layer, and it could also exist at the application layer and through governance by establishing trusted identity authorities. And there is a digital identity certification that can be carried around and you don't get access to services unless you've been validated as. Yes, not designator, something. I don't know, smarter people than me, like all of you out there, are going to solve this problem. I'm just smart enough to see that there's a problem, not to solve it. But I think that there's a lot of different options all the way through the tech stack, from governance and market, all the way down to user and profile.
00:36:45.226 - 00:36:55.784, Speaker A: From a regulatory perspective, where should we be preserving privacy? So we heard, you know, definitely the protocol layer, I think, from Neeraj, Miller and Marina. Does that make sense to you also?
00:36:56.364 - 00:38:00.874, Speaker D: I mean, I think that that's a good place to put it. It really depends on the specific ecosystem. For some, like in a more centralized system, I think protocol is a good place to put it or build it in. And especially for decentralized systems, too. Yeah, honestly, it really is going to be systems based and a lot of very key discussions about which intermediaries do you want to impose obligations on? Like, I am not convinced that miners escape ever being treated as a key financial service provider. If the future is truly decentralization, they may, if intermediaries continue to play a critical role as currently defined, maybe miners never get covered beyond things like sanctions, compliance, but they could be, like, I could imagine that that might be part of the future where there might need to be some kind of validation of some kind of information, even if it's not your PII, but it is that you are not designated or some other kind of illicit actor or validation. So I think privacy really means defining what is the type of information that needs to be seen by what players in order to mitigate what the risk looks like.
00:38:00.874 - 00:38:11.134, Speaker D: If the DeFi sector arises to this challenge by building in technologies and governance controls that mitigate the risk, there may not be a need for future regulatory impositions.
00:38:12.074 - 00:38:19.618, Speaker A: So you're saying builders should come before regulators in terms of figuring out how to balance this need between privacy and enforcement?
00:38:19.706 - 00:38:20.754, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's fair.
00:38:20.834 - 00:38:22.226, Speaker A: Marina, you look like you're about to say something.
00:38:22.250 - 00:39:18.782, Speaker E: Yeah, I just wanted to comment, speaking about privacy and also crypto transactions. In spring this year in Europe, we had the fight of, basically there was a possibility of unhosted wallets, as our regulation calls them, being prohibited, which is one of the most important elements in crypto and crypto transactions. And we were discussing with regulators at that time, we wanted to make them understand that there is so much data available publicly on the blockchain. And then when combined with the data that specific crypto as a service providers need to collect, there could be a lot of potential bridges. And there is also a very european element to this, if I may. Most of the service providers and payment providers are not EU based. And so Europeans are very concerned about data and their privacy, which you can also see on how GDPR is in a way written and defined.
00:39:18.782 - 00:39:35.234, Speaker E: So I think that it's also very, very important for us to make the best of educating regulators and make them understand that this is a little bit different, is specific, and also try to use the public data in case they would want to fight criminal activities.
00:39:36.214 - 00:39:49.874, Speaker A: I want to, in the last few minutes, give us a couple of rapid fire questions. So we're going to go down the line. We're going to zoom out a little bit. I want everyone to make a prediction for 2023 and what you think will happen on the policy front. So we'll start with Neeraj and go down the line.
00:39:51.134 - 00:39:54.822, Speaker C: More enforcement actions? Definitely more enforcement actions.
00:39:54.838 - 00:39:55.750, Speaker A: I think from who?
00:39:55.902 - 00:40:17.714, Speaker C: Probably the SEC, perhaps more from the CFTC. I think that the regulations around what is and isn't a security in particular have been pretty. There's a lot of things out there that very clearly fall into the. Is an unregistered security category. And I think that the cadence of those enforcements is going to pick up.
00:40:18.134 - 00:40:18.886, Speaker A: Miller.
00:40:19.030 - 00:40:23.014, Speaker B: I think dollar stablecoin legislation will pass in the US.
00:40:24.154 - 00:40:25.890, Speaker A: Stablecoin legislation will pass in the US.
00:40:25.962 - 00:40:26.330, Speaker C: Yep.
00:40:26.402 - 00:40:28.002, Speaker A: Okay. Big prediction, marina.
00:40:28.178 - 00:41:09.296, Speaker E: The markets in crypto assets regulation and transfer of funds regulation are going to be published in the European Union journal. And I think there's going to be a lot of activities on the national competent authorities and agencies like ESMA and EBa trying to finalize the last technical aspects of the implementation of mica. And we are also seeing some of the ideas around the first regulation of NFT. So maybe some ideas around metaverse. But what's also very concerning at the moment in Europe is the energy crisis. So we've been looking into blockchains and crypto assets and how much they into their energy consumption. So we might hear some news from, from that front, too.
00:41:09.400 - 00:41:11.488, Speaker A: Be more specific. What do you think on the energy front?
00:41:11.616 - 00:41:56.772, Speaker E: So there's been already some documentation written by the European Commission on how the classification of different crypto assets should be done linked to their energy consumption. And many times I've been to one of the conferences last week in Brussels. A lot of regulators are thinking how to, in a way, limit the use of bitcoin or proof of work. In a way. Again, we had this discussion in spring and proof of work, there was a discussion of prohibiting proof of work in different ways, but it will be definitely limited in a way that it could be potentially taxed more just because of the energy consumption.
00:41:56.828 - 00:41:58.588, Speaker A: So Europe will limit the use of bitcoin.
00:41:58.756 - 00:41:59.220, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:41:59.292 - 00:42:00.052, Speaker A: And Carol?
00:42:00.188 - 00:42:32.542, Speaker D: Yeah, I totally agree with all these points. Enforcement, whether it's SEC, C, FTC, FinCen, IR's, maybe OFAC, I definitely think there'll be a focus on stablecoin legislation, but also something in the US under the competitiveness framework that was just published by the Department of Commerce. For the first time ever, there's specific prongs of a framework to try to drive us competitiveness in DLT and broader fintech technologies. So I'm looking forward to the research and development authorities that really get brought to the table in 2023 related to.
00:42:32.558 - 00:42:48.258, Speaker A: This tech, more american investment in web3 as opposed to regulating on web3. Last two minutes. Each of you has one sentence. What is a call to action that you want to leave our audience with? What's one thing you want them to do or a message that you want to leave them with? Neeraj?
00:42:48.426 - 00:43:11.124, Speaker C: I mean, I'm supposed to say donate to coin center, right? That would be the most important one. But I think, I guess what really helps us is if you guys out there are building things that have really clear use cases and are particularly advancing privacy and things like that. So just keep doing what you're doing, I guess, and keep building great things.
00:43:11.624 - 00:43:12.256, Speaker A: Miller.
00:43:12.360 - 00:43:20.488, Speaker B: Make a mass consumer product. That's a good answer. My answer is explain to your political representatives why you care about crypto and Defi.
00:43:20.656 - 00:43:23.084, Speaker A: Call your congressperson or your parliamentarian.
00:43:23.944 - 00:43:34.304, Speaker B: It's an amorphous concept to most people in government, and I think hearing from constituents at our proponents is absolutely vital.
00:43:34.684 - 00:43:35.460, Speaker A: Marina?
00:43:35.612 - 00:44:12.442, Speaker E: I would say reach out to your national advocacy organization. But at the same time, maybe think about the values and the card questions that now also regulators are posing and in a way, self regulate. We know the Terra Luna story, and the consequence of this is that we have an article in Mika talking about this specific kind of stable coins. And I think, I believe this is very similar to what happened in the US, too. So I think it's best to hear less about the bad stories and work on a positive narrative around crypto.
00:44:12.538 - 00:44:14.034, Speaker A: Great. And Carol, great.
00:44:14.114 - 00:44:53.922, Speaker D: I'm sure. No surprise. It's really, I would call you all to think about that nexus and that focus on areas between privacy and identity. I actually think that is the beating heart of like a very and a common thread behind navigating these issues properly in the future of regulation and defining what the future of the Internet can look like upon rails that can support both value transfer and information transfer simultaneously. So I think that tech can help solve this problem, but we need people coming to the table with their builder capabilities and mindsets, with a little bit of simple empathy towards the regulators and empathy towards the objectives that they're trying to drive and protect you all.
00:44:54.018 - 00:45:01.874, Speaker A: And I would say, please engage with crypto policy and track what's going on wherever you live. And that's it. Thank you all so much, and thank you to our amazing panelists.
