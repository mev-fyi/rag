00:00:04.640 - 00:00:27.395, Speaker A: Wow, this is exciting. Thank you very much for coming here. My name is Ka. I'm the co founder at Birdeye and very excited to be here with you guys to give you guys some updates about what we have been working on and as well as what is lying in the road ahead. So Breakpoint is very special event in the year. Right. Because it's like a checkpoint to looking back and looking forward.
00:00:27.395 - 00:01:42.065, Speaker A: And firstly at Bird Eye, I want to show you guys some numbers about how we have been doing in 2024. So the first one, the first number is in 2024 we served 24 million retail users. So that means there was 24 million people actually visited our website to checking for different information, token price and checking for some wallet information. So that's exciting. The second one is that we have been building over 30 features, data and trading features for our retail users that including all the token information on the wallet information swapping some rewards for you guys and that one is being increased a lot in the rest of the year and also next year as well. And the last one is we have 44 million API requests to our servers every day and that means every second like this there are like over 500 people actually assessing requests to our servers to getting the information to go to your wallets exchange and many others applications that you guys use every day. So that's exciting.
00:01:42.065 - 00:02:15.721, Speaker A: This is whether or not this is. Are we proud of this? Yes. But is it good enough? No. So what do we think is that currently Birdeye is the most comprehensive tool for on chain traders and also for the Birdeye data services. We are currently the most reliable and most popular trading data provider for crypto projects. Yes, but everything is just getting started. So today we are very exciting to introduce three major upgrades for us.
00:02:15.721 - 00:02:59.055, Speaker A: So we are introducing a totally new interface that's a lot faster. We're introducing features that allow you to personalize your mobile experience and of course a totally new mobile app as well. Right, I'll go through that one. So firstly we redesigned, completely redesigned Bodeye and the new versions with the new technology, new servers, new infrastructure designed, it's going to be like 2.3 times faster than what you are using right now. So that means you can get the information a lot faster, a lot more real time and you can make a better decision on chain. Okay.
00:02:59.055 - 00:03:32.735, Speaker A: And this one can be shipped in mid October. So about three weeks from now you're going to receive the information update and when you go to Birdeye you're going to see the new version. Okay. And the second one we are introducing Bird Eye Panel. So Bird Eye Panel is where you can actually using our data, but then customize the user interface. You can drag and drop, you can monitor what you care about. Because we have been working to build all the tools based on what we know.
00:03:32.735 - 00:04:10.865, Speaker A: But I think that solar narrative community is very talented and you guys want to cook your own monitor dashboard. So we build Bird Eye Panel so you can actually build your own dashboard and then you can publish and also introduce it to your users, to your friends, to the people, to your community. So this is something very, very, very important. And of course finally. Oh, sorry, but this one going to ship also in mid October as well. So three weeks from now and finally we have the mobile app. So mobile app is already in the final stage of reviewing.
00:04:10.865 - 00:04:46.801, Speaker A: You're going to have the data on the go with instant notifications. So that means you will not miss any signals. If you remember, we also have something called Bodeye Alerts. So it's like you can do a lot of technical analysis and when all the condition being met, you can actually send the notification to your email currently. But with Bodeye mobile app you can actually send it directly to your phone. So that will reduce a lot of waiting time and you can make your trade like buy or sell it on time. All right, and this one is actually being released very soon.
00:04:46.801 - 00:05:20.047, Speaker A: This one even shipped in early October, so about two weeks from now. All right, so those are our updates today. We have only five minutes, so I cannot tell you more. We are working on a lot of other things, but that one going to be the next update. So the bird eye version 2, which is a new interface that's a lot faster. Budeye Panel features that allow you to personalize your Bird Eye experience and the totally newly designed mobile app. Thank you very much and all future updates until next time, bye.
