00:00:02.920 - 00:00:38.122, Speaker A: Awesome. So it's so great to be with everybody today and with all of you that are streaming and watching the show. I'm Matt Stots. You might know I'm also the host of the Permissionless art podcast. I've had a lot of different NFT artists and creators and technologists on the podcast, as well as being the co founder and chief strategy officer at Olaplex. Really excited to have our panel here to talk about scaling nfts, essentially what's going to be happening here in the market as we continue to build and go through that opportunity. I want to introduce everybody quickly, and then I'm going to hand it to Vic to do a little bit of a context setting for all of us.
00:00:38.122 - 00:01:16.050, Speaker A: So we have adeyoshan. He's the co founder of Glass XYZ and the first category leading NFT marketplace on Ethereum. And now on Solana, which is awesome, right? And we have Larissa Barbu, COO of Exchange Art, which is the leading fine art marketplace on Solana for nfts. Fantastic. And then Vikwin from Alpha team at Nansen, it's a blockchain analytic company that specializes in on chain data visualization and research. And so he's got some great context for us to kind of kick us off.
00:01:16.202 - 00:02:04.734, Speaker B: Hey, thank you so much for having me here, everyone. I guess the first question we got asked with scalability is, why are we here? How did we get to this point? I guess it's kind of almost like a history lesson. Originally, with cryptocurrency, we had the birth of Defi, then we had the birth of nfts. However, we found that with liquidity, it didn't stay on one blockchain. So what actually happened was this actually goes back to 2016, where vitilig Buderin, he outlined something called the blockchain trilemma. And basically with a blockchain, it's either decentralized scalability or security, but you can only be two out of three successfully, if that makes sense. So in regards to, say, Solana, what happened with that? It's got a hybrid consensus model which uses proof of history, and that's combined with proof of staking.
00:02:04.734 - 00:03:03.424, Speaker B: And in that regards, that resulted in basically a mass adoption, basically because the amount of transactions and the cost of transactions is a lot more scalable. So to kind of give it a perspective, I guess it's like you're comparing the tps around about 13 to about theoretical 65,000 tps that kind of rivals like your tradfi payment processes that are available right now in the day and age. But is a Solana NFT exactly the same as, say, one on another blockchain? I'd say no. A, it's not EVM compatible, but b, it's built on rust as opposed to solidity. But third, it also has a different token standard. So if we kind of can't, like, if we kind of deep dive into a little bit more like the components of a blockchain, it relies on a peer to peer network cryptography, an algorithm consensus, as well as a reward and kind of like, I guess, punishment system, if that makes sense. So going back to like, I guess, like we've got the proof of stake.
00:03:03.424 - 00:03:54.944, Speaker B: And the concept of that is that basically a nodes of a commit to the network and they get selected to validate, then they get rewarded for their securing a network, if that makes sense. So we then took proof of history, which is basically now the nodes can be segmented into time slots, and on top of that, leader nodes, they keep track of time, if that makes sense. And what that means is that the network can validate transactions without the need for the block to fill up. So that reduces the latency, but also increases the throughput. And then as a result of that, that's where the scalability and greater mass adoption occurs. Right? Because now you've got lower cost of transactions, you've got multiple transactions on a much greater scale. And then as a result of that, you had key players that entered into the space, people that were minting, people that are trading, people that are collecting, people that are creating.
00:03:54.944 - 00:04:03.424, Speaker B: They all gravitated to the space. And I feel like we don't have that first mover advantage. We do definitely have that greater adoption and global scale advantage.
00:04:04.284 - 00:04:33.858, Speaker A: So, Victor, I think you've laid out really well what the kind of technical underpinnings of the Solana network and other competing blockchains are in this space. And then how that has had some effect on nfts. At Olaplex, we're building enterprise infrastructure for NFT projects that are going to go from 10,000 to 10 million users and more and 10 million to hundreds of millions or billions of assets and more. And we're bullish on that. Long term. We're not seeing that now. We're definitely in a different market condition.
00:04:33.858 - 00:04:48.946, Speaker A: So I'm going to ask you, Larissa, like, what do you see from creators? And do you know, what are you seeing from the market conditions today? What are creators looking for in terms of scalability? Will we see these massive drops or giant growth in the digital assets such as NFT.
00:04:49.130 - 00:05:45.304, Speaker C: So I think that from a creator's perspective, what they are looking for is liquid market. And certainly Solana being the highest growing community, both from a developer perspective and an artist perspective, has helped that massively. The fact that Solana has high transaction speed and really low cost helps a lot with mass adoption, because the promise of web3 for creators was that they will find new ways to monetize their artworks. However, what happened with a few l ones out there is that the costs are most of the time prohibitive for most of the artists out there. So Solana really helps breaking these barriers and actually delivers on the promise of creating a new place and new technologies to help creators monetize their artworks.
00:05:45.484 - 00:06:02.924, Speaker A: Got it. Dio. I'd ask you kind of a similar question. You're doing video nfts now. You're taking an awful lot of experience and imagery and kind of locking that up in a single digital asset. What are creators looking for in terms of scalability, and how do you kind of convey that to them, and what do they find important?
00:06:03.504 - 00:06:07.952, Speaker D: So I would say that creators are first looking to monetize their creations.
00:06:08.008 - 00:06:08.344, Speaker A: Sure.
00:06:08.424 - 00:07:05.724, Speaker D: So all video creators typically go from TikTok to YouTube to monetize. And so from a scalability perspective, they would prefer a blockchain that they didn't even really have to know about, where it's like, you could buy an NFT and you have less than $30 in your wallet. And so I would say that creators want an accessible blockchain, unlike ETH, which we were on ETH for like a year last year, and we had done drops with like ten Timbaland Kaigo, and being able to buy an NFT on ETH using metamask, the experience was a lot of friction. And so creators really just want like a frictionless experience where they can just buy nfts super seamlessly. Honestly, if they could do it with a credit card, that would probably be best. And the goal is to really just monetize their creations and own what they're creating with the community that shares it together.
00:07:06.424 - 00:07:32.344, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think one of the things people are seeing from the Solana blockchain is just that much faster user experience. If you know, you've got obviously lower gas fees, if any at all. That certainly moves things up. Vic, what are you seeing from the perspective? I know Nansen has really good intel onto what's happening in all of the blockchains. Really. So what are you seeing in NFT market in particular? From your vantage point.
00:07:32.644 - 00:08:25.084, Speaker B: So from my vantage point, we're seeing a lot of interesting, I guess, behaviors from the participants in the space, if that makes sense. We're finding, for example, over the time, you have, for example, the creation of daos that are designed to specifically collect artwork for creators, and they're forming a pool based on just enjoyment of the art, if that makes sense. Kind of like on one on one art kind of level, but also on the other end of the spectrum, you've got people that are collecting the artwork and NFT projects and kind of like flipping it and then with the intention of kind of like the trading mentality, if that makes sense. And then somewhere in between all that, you've just got the people that just enjoy collecting the art. They just like the art. And then it's kind of like interesting when you observe, say, like you go into their wallet and observe, it's just like the different arrays of someone's collection of nfts, if that makes sense.
00:08:25.584 - 00:08:48.864, Speaker A: So, Larissa, you've been doing great work with artists and fine art, I guess you would call it. And really one of one artists is another way people describe these NFT creators. How much more opportunity do you think there is in this category on Solana? Do you see this as a growing market? Have you reached stasis in some way? What's next?
00:08:48.984 - 00:09:58.154, Speaker C: I think we're looking at significant growth over the next one or two years, largely because we are looking at larger brands that are looking to enter the space. So recently we had Reddit, who just onboarded, what, 3 million wallets with one collection. We have a newly owned Elon Musk Twitter that is looking to bring nfts closer to their core business model. We have meta, we have Google, who just announced here at Breakpoint some new, more support for artists and for nfts and for Solana. So I think there is great, there is great growth that will come in the next one or two years. I think we are also looking, the more we are pushing ahead, I think we are looking at more utility and use cases for nfts that will help drive mass adoption. I think we are also looking next year at a continuation of the heated debate on royalties as marketplaces and artists and collectors are figuring out which ones are the best business models that they would like to apply going forward.
00:09:58.154 - 00:10:17.002, Speaker C: But exchange art will be here to support the creators in their endeavors in the next couple of years. So that's what we see over the next couple of years. I don't think we reached in any way capacity and I think there is a lot of upside from here onwards.
00:10:17.138 - 00:10:51.914, Speaker A: Well, I would agree there's a lot of upside. There's certainly bullish signal from the fact that Instagram is integrating Solana, nfts, Google coming in to support some infrastructure in terms of running validators and providing cloud services at the same time. Those are really big brands. These are the tech giants. And so as a startup operator, as a, you know, small, relatively to the scale of these tech behemoths. Larissa, how do you think about that with your company in that context? That's some pretty heady potential competition.
00:10:52.654 - 00:11:45.326, Speaker C: I don't see much as competition. I see there is just a lot of opportunity going forward. We have our knowledge that we managed together over the past year, and we have built a strong community here on Solana as our home. And I think we will be looking to collaborate with all the other big brands that are coming to the space to find the best ways to help creators grow and to deliver on the promise in which we started a year ago, to actually help creators make a living and thrive outside of the traditional art model where they depend on a gallery that typically charges between 50% to 70% of their sale price. So we will still be here and we'll be looking to help and to partner with all the actors that can help us deliver on the promise that we've made a year ago.
00:11:45.470 - 00:12:03.258, Speaker A: Great. I would paint the same question to you, Dayo. So you were talking about your projects. Your creators come to you from YouTube, they come to you from Instagram. These are meta and Google's products. So how do you feel about this? It's really a good sign, but also potentially challenging.
00:12:03.346 - 00:12:21.010, Speaker D: So I think we need context because we started this, because we believe video is the biggest market in the world. And so in the 1960s, 1970s, there were about ten video shows, ten channels, a few cable networks that own those channels.
00:12:21.042 - 00:12:21.962, Speaker A: I think it was fewer than that.
00:12:22.018 - 00:13:33.144, Speaker D: Yeah, fewer than that. And then in 2005, you had YouTube that came out and it pretty much just said, anyone can make their own channel, anyone can be a star, and YouTube is going to own that network. And now in web3, in 2021, you had glass, which came out and said, anyone can create a channel, anyone can become a star, and anyone can own the network that they're creating content for. So I think there's a fundamental issue for web two platforms coming into the space, which comes down to creator ownership of the platform. You know, it's like Ronaldo has how many followers on Instagram? It's like people come to Instagram for Ronaldo. And so I think what we're going to see is humans are going to get tired of intermediaries like ads getting in between their experience with the people who they want to connect with. We're going to see these live experiences like this, where you're making like, you know, Timbaland is making $30,000 in like 40, like 2 hours on his Genesis music video with his board ape.
00:13:33.144 - 00:14:29.558, Speaker D: And that's an experience that is fundamentally not possible on YouTube. And so I think from a marketing perspective, there's a new tool set. I think from a, like, actual product perspective, there's a new tool set. Ownership of that product perspective, there's a new tool set. And I just think when you have so many different parts of the founder stack being disrupted, I don't think that they're going to be able to get like a creator like Tihan from China, who has 100 followers on Twitter but can still monetize his video and have team make $1,000 by getting 50 collectors that are buying his video video for $20. So I don't think they're going to be able to compete where we are because we're just a little underneath. But I do think it's great to have these bigger guys come in just to give more validation to the people who still might be on the fence.
00:14:29.558 - 00:14:32.262, Speaker D: But I would say hop. Now if you're on the fence, I hear you.
00:14:32.278 - 00:15:01.522, Speaker A: So great way to just put the context out there. Web two, web3, you can't compete with what I love. I think diode is the first time I've ever heard this founder stack. We talk a lot about the software stack and the technology stack, Olaplex. We build an indexer that's fully open source but available for every protocol to read off of the chain. And we're so deep into that, and then you realize you've got fundamental economics for the founders, people who want to create and own what they're doing. That's really fundamentally different.
00:15:01.618 - 00:15:38.510, Speaker D: Yeah, creators are creator businesses now, right? Everyone grew their network on somebody else's platform and they're realizing that and they're like, dang it. But now, as people collect your nfts, you have a one to one relationship with those people, and then you just keep growing that. And so instead of MrBeast giving people a bunch of money ten years later into his YouTube career, now you have up and coming MRBeast that is offering you nfts for $10. You're flipping those for like 30, $40 and as Mister Beast drops each video, you're monetizing with him throughout his career. To the top.
00:15:38.582 - 00:15:56.758, Speaker A: Incredible. Plus there's beast burgers now too, right? I think, yeah. So we went IRL Vic, I wanted to get back to some interesting questions around scale. We talked a lot about the technology stack. Dio told us about the founder stack, which is really cool. But there's a financial stack as well. In the Solana ecosystem, we're talking about low cost of transactions.
00:15:56.758 - 00:16:11.330, Speaker A: But also, how does that general availability of a highly work liquid token and many tokenized protocols, how does that accelerate adoption here and create better uses for creators, people who are making nfTs?
00:16:11.442 - 00:16:51.274, Speaker B: Definitely, because when you're looking at a global scale, you want the creator economy to be able to access the tools to be able to create, and it's not really possible if it costs hundreds of dollars to actually create their works, if that makes sense. So being able to do transactions for fractions of a cent, and then, for example, you look at Solana Mobile, looking at having mobile devices available to all hands kind of thing to all users. The experience of being able to onboard people, like, say, on a web two level, on a web3, where the experience is pretty much no different in the future. You're now having creators giving more scale in terms of reach than ever before.
00:16:52.074 - 00:17:19.066, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah. I would just add that, you know, you're participating in an economy, and so when you, when you come into the Solana ecosystem, there are built in economics that can really work to the advantage of anyone who's creating. And obviously you've got liquidity, you've got the ability to trade the assets that you're creating. A lot of fundamental things that I think for the founders who are coming to this space, they really have to appreciate, right. They're not just using a service or a platform.
00:17:19.130 - 00:17:19.516, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:17:19.570 - 00:17:39.644, Speaker A: That's really cool. I'm going to do a quick lightning round, and I'm going to ask you a little bit about your favorite nfTs. Vic, I know you are in the Monk Dao, serious SMB owner and all that, but you can't shill your own project or your favorite. So pick another favorite project in NFT and we'll go down the line and talk about them.
00:17:39.944 - 00:18:14.462, Speaker B: Another favorite project, actually, Solarium NFT. Basically, it's a project that a friend created, but it was basically a precisionly generated flowers and stuff like that. And she created basically out of passion from an artist's perspective, but watching the behind us process of actually working out the different layers between the gradients and stuff like that was just really fascinating. Watching someone who was previously web two into the web3 space and then actually appreciating it from watching a founder grow, essentially, that was something I had the privilege of. I couldn't get that anywhere else.
00:18:14.578 - 00:18:15.874, Speaker A: Amazing. Larissa.
00:18:16.614 - 00:18:46.030, Speaker C: I will pick a category instead of an artist. And my category of choice this time is 3D Art. 3d art. So we are looking at. And the reason why I'm looking at that is because in the future, in probably one or two years, we'll see more and more fine art merging with fashion. And that's where this 3d art will come and play a bigger role. So that's my peak of the day.
00:18:46.102 - 00:18:50.246, Speaker A: Amazing. Dio. Now you gotta pick a video. NFT. So it's gonna be hard.
00:18:50.350 - 00:19:14.386, Speaker D: Yeah, this is almost impossible just because we've dropped so many amazing drops, which you guys can check out on ETH Glass XYZ and the new Glass XYZ. But we recently just did a drop with kids of the apocalypse and they did like a 666 NFT mint on Magic Eden and then linked that to, to their debut music video, NFT, that they dropped on glass on Thursday.
00:19:14.530 - 00:19:14.866, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:19:14.890 - 00:19:30.850, Speaker D: And so everyone who collected the magickine one was able to collect the free video NFT. And then they were able to flip that. And so I would say kids of the apocalypse, which was done with Rio, Cregan and some legendary guys, like, it kind of feels like stranger things and I don't know if they're gonna make a movie.
00:19:30.882 - 00:19:43.540, Speaker A: Awesome. I gotta check it out. I'd say my favorite is Motley friends coming out on the night market. New project I think is super cool. And I want to thank you all for being here and talking about the market and what's happening on Solana.
00:19:43.652 - 00:19:44.164, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:19:44.204 - 00:19:45.404, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you, thank you.
