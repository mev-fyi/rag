00:00:03.760 - 00:00:23.286, Speaker A: Okay, we have a really awesome panel today. It's so good to see all of you. As Pedro said, my name's Amira Veliani. I'm the head of policy at the Solana foundation. But before this, I was a startup founder. Before that, I used to work in foreign policy at the US government. So the title is the little JPEG that laundered money.
00:00:23.286 - 00:00:57.404, Speaker A: Illicit finance is one of the biggest questions and ideas in policy making circles and crypto today. And so we're going to dive deep in this area. We're mostly going to focus on the US and Europe, not because the rest of the world isn't important. We just got to focus somewhere because it's a really big world. So we have Carol House, who, former Fincen, former White House advisor. She actually helped write President Biden's executive order on digital assets. We have Isabella Chase, who is a senior policy advisor at TRM Labs.
00:00:57.404 - 00:01:31.444, Speaker A: We have Landon Zinda, who is policy council at Coin center, one of the oldest and premier think tanks covering blockchain, which really focus on privacy, and also former staffer for Senator Toomey and representative Emmer in the US. And we have one last panelist who's getting mic'd up and about to join us, who is Kristin Eartham. She leads illicit finance at the Department of State. So we got a real set of pros out here to talk about this issue, so why don't we kick it off? Carol, can you tell us why illicit finance is important? Why should we care?
00:01:31.864 - 00:02:18.164, Speaker B: Great question. And it's an issue that Kristen and I got to work together a lot on and care a ton about. I know you do as well, really, that most illicit activity, most criminal activity is not just done as part of activism or just for its own. And it's really normally to make money. And certainly most illicit activity in national security, security threats also require money to continue to fuel those ecosystems and prop up whether it's proliferation regimes, whether it's human trafficking networks, cartels, cyber criminals. So money plays an integral role in really most transnational organized crime. So illicit finance is a huge vector of vulnerabilities that are being exploited in most illicit activity, but also a really great vector for disruption if you want to lay costs and consequences on illicit ecosystems.
00:02:18.524 - 00:02:30.264, Speaker A: And Kristin, right on time. We're talking about why illicit finance is important. Can you tell us something kind of scary that's happened while in government, something that might help us understand the threats here? Sure.
00:02:31.164 - 00:03:06.996, Speaker C: Hi, everybody. My name is Kristin Eartham. I am a senior advisor at the US Department of State for foreign Friends. That's the Ministry of Foreign affairs. And what I would say is open a newspaper recognizing the crowd we're in front of open Google news. Look at anything that is not natural disaster related, that was fun, that was funded with probably large money and sometimes even small money. So anything that you see in the news, be it a cyber incident, be it a terrorist attack, be it a North Korea stealing a bunch of money that was funded by somebody.
00:03:06.996 - 00:03:10.824, Speaker C: And so that is why illicit finance and the fight against illicit finance is so important.
00:03:12.124 - 00:03:30.184, Speaker A: So there's a tricky balance in illicit finance. And this isn't new in blockchain world, but I think technology has introduced new questions, which is, what is the balance between maintaining privacy in the right software developers and countering illicit finance? Landon, I'm curious how coin center thinks about that.
00:03:30.564 - 00:03:41.700, Speaker D: Yeah. So thanks for having me. I am thankfully, the only crypto bro on this panel. I appreciate the composition of this panel. Hopefully, it's more representative of crypto in the future.
00:03:41.892 - 00:03:43.924, Speaker A: It's unusual in the space, but I'm proud of it.
00:03:44.004 - 00:03:44.624, Speaker E: Yes.
00:03:46.414 - 00:04:14.584, Speaker D: I would take issue with the fact that, or the claim that it's a balance. I think rights are inherent in the US. We have many of those rights. They can't be balanced. And if they are balanced, they already are balanced in our constitution and the amendments. So you have a right to your papers and things, and the government can't come get them without a warrant. You have a right to due process.
00:04:14.584 - 00:04:25.224, Speaker D: So I would take issue with the fact that it's a balance and say those balances are already reflected in our laws.
00:04:26.724 - 00:04:41.902, Speaker A: Carol. Carol, you're someone who spent time in government working on these issues. Now, you've been outside government for about a year. How do you think about that balance? Or how would you characterize that as someone who's seen the really scary threats, but also now has spent some time in the private sector, in the space that's fair.
00:04:42.038 - 00:05:27.806, Speaker B: And I really do appreciate and respect coin center's work, and Landon's also really focusing and prioritizing privacy so much. I do consider it to be more of a balance, like even looking at the Fourth Amendment, it isn't against all search and seizure, it's unlawful search and seizure. So to me, and there's also sometimes a miscategorization of anonymity and privacy as being the same thing. Privacy does not equal anonymity. You can achieve privacy via anonymity, but typically, privacy doesn't mean the absence of data means pretty important, sensitive data, that is. Then protected, but there are still mechanisms for discovery and disclosure under certain protections, permissions and conditions. So I think that that kind of balance comes to play when we think about things like our anti money laundering frameworks and knowing your customer.
00:05:27.806 - 00:06:17.424, Speaker B: It isn't that all data gets reported to the government and a big brother complete surveillance state. It's that certain information gets collected by financial institutions, typically is where the regulatory perimeter really likes to sit, and collecting certain information that is most useful to authorities, that can be gathered when it's held at the financial institution for recordkeeping, and in some cases, things like suspicious activity reports that get proactively provided to the government. So it's a balance of, like, what information gets collected by whom? Does it get proactively reported? Does it get held by the institution? What type of due process should the government have to go through in order to get access to that data and those records? All of those things, as well as burden to industry and other things, all really play together as part of, in my view, you that balance of what makes up a surveillance or monitoring or combating illicit finance regime.
00:06:17.844 - 00:06:37.368, Speaker A: Can I make sure, I'll try to provide a crude version of what you just said and you tell me if this is right. You have the right to privacy. You don't necessarily have the right to anonymity. And privacy often comes with certain parameters that should a government agency need to sort of dig into the details of, say, a transaction, they have the ability to do so.
00:06:37.396 - 00:06:56.484, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's totally right. And one just tiny thing is also that we typically demand more privacy in our information activity, like our Internet activity, than we expect in our financial activity. So that's like, I think the context of the data and the activity that's being looked for also has implications for what kind of privacy people expect.
00:06:56.864 - 00:07:11.972, Speaker A: Isabella? I think in Europe, there's a different balance, as sort of the european context thinks about privacy versus illicit finance, and sort of the prioritization of different rights in different ways. What's sort of the european perspective on this balance? Yes.
00:07:12.068 - 00:07:17.708, Speaker E: So representing the rest of the world and not America, not the rest of.
00:07:17.716 - 00:07:19.364, Speaker A: The world, one big continent with a.
00:07:19.364 - 00:07:59.180, Speaker E: Lot of countries, totally national security is still incredibly important within Europe, whether that be the UK or European Union. We also have crypto asset related national security concerns. It's not quite so concentrated in the US, very much around DPRK. With us, we're looking much more at russian based sanction evasion. So there is still very much that need to not enable fully anonymous payments, which I think is where the problem comes to. Right. National security is about tying risk indicators to entities or individuals.
00:07:59.180 - 00:08:33.554, Speaker E: If we can't do that, then we have a problem. But as Carol was saying, you can still have privacy within that. It's just about who has access to the information. I think within Europe, just the whole national security conversation is not as much in the development of crypto asset regulations as it is in the US. Privacy is important, but actually creating a competitive framework for a domestic european crypto asset industry is much more important. And that's what we see in the Mika language. We see much less national security language.
00:08:33.894 - 00:08:49.434, Speaker A: Landon, I'm curious for you to respond to. I think this framework that's been suggested by Carol and Isabella around privacy is not the same as anonymity. And privacy comes with some safeguards or options for government. Does that resonate with you?
00:08:51.294 - 00:09:45.482, Speaker D: It does, but I would say most of those protections still emanate from the constitution and from the amendments. The question about what sort of due process do we get in our financial transactions and having to report them to the government? There's a lot of conversation right now about illicit finance and crypto. And I just kind of ask, what are we trying to solve for? We've seen recently a lot of incorrect reporting about the level of crypto, the level cryptocurrency is used in funding Hamas or other illicit activity. And we've seen some of those reports be scaled back. And some of the reports have said crypto has accounted for about 1% of Hamas funding. Any percent is a bad amount, and we should seek that out. But we should put that into context and think about what the other 99% are.
00:09:45.482 - 00:09:58.714, Speaker D: And a lot of that is cash, credit cards, precious metals. We're not trying to get rid of those things. So we need to put the level of cryptocurrency used in illicit finance in context and address it proportionally.
00:09:59.534 - 00:10:19.494, Speaker C: But Isabella, if I may, on that point, please. What we're trying to do and where we, as the United States, where the Financial Action Task Force, where 207 countries and jurisdictions are members of and have agreed that, yes, virtual assets, the term used by Fadifier, has to be regulated in the same way that banks are.
00:10:19.534 - 00:10:21.966, Speaker A: Is that we're asked, can you define fat if for the audience?
00:10:22.110 - 00:10:59.158, Speaker C: So Financial Action Task force, it's the money laundering, terror financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. AML, CFT, CPF, that's the standard setting body for the world. And they set minimum standards like, this is the lowest common denominator that people have to comply with. And I could count off the number of countries that aren't members of FATF on one hand, maybe two. But the major players, every major economy in the world is part of FAtfice and said, we will uphold these FATF standards. And so what that is, is we're saying to the virtual asset community, it's bigger than just crypto. But that defines.
00:10:59.158 - 00:11:27.044, Speaker C: That's how FATF is defining the space, is that it is the same requirements on credit cards, on dealers of precious metals and stones, on bank accounts as it is. It will be the same. That is what the standard says, and that is what everybody from the government level has agreed to uphold and implement within their own national jurisdictions. And so that being said, it's exactly that land. And it is. We want. We're not trying to push this community out.
00:11:27.044 - 00:12:05.542, Speaker C: To the contrary, we want to work with the community to figure out what regulation makes sense in the crypto space. What is different from banking? What is different, you know, in crypto for making was different from banking in crypto. But make sure that the regulations work for everybody so that we are not funding DPRK in their quest for a nuclear weapon. We are not funding Iran for a nuclear weapon. And both of these entities have, do and continue to use, using the gerund, continuing to use crypto and fiat to fund their aspirations. That's what we're asking for, for help. Ransomware accounted for 20 billion in financing.
00:12:05.542 - 00:12:12.794, Speaker C: So that is a big number. That is something that needs to be stopped, and that's what we're trying to do without killing the ecosystem.
00:12:13.374 - 00:12:15.142, Speaker A: You look like you're about to say something, Isabella.
00:12:15.198 - 00:12:28.758, Speaker E: Of course. And we have one crucial difference with crypto. Right? You mentioned cash, precious metals, hawala. Let's throw in trade based money laundering for fun. We can't trace those. We just can't. But we can trace crypto.
00:12:28.758 - 00:12:41.954, Speaker E: And so I think that is a fundamental difference that we also need to appreciate. It's really not about going after the industry. It's about working with the industry for that 1% of terrorist financing that we could hopefully trace to do so.
00:12:42.694 - 00:12:49.354, Speaker C: But we also can track hawala's. Hawalas, also, under the fandom standards, have to keep records of who they transact with, too.
00:12:49.814 - 00:13:11.424, Speaker A: So, speaking of traceability, I want to talk about tornado cash. Raise your hand if you've heard of tornado cash. Okay, pretty good showing. So we're going to have a little debate or a lively discussion. Isabella, I want you to tee us off being sort of as fact based as possible. Can you tell us what happened with tornado cash?
00:13:11.584 - 00:14:00.410, Speaker E: Sure. So tornado cash, as you all know, is a mixer on Ethereum. It came into being in 2019, and it is very good at what it does. And what it does is disassociate the sender and beneficiary of transactions, which made it very popular with privacy advocates, people who very legitimately wanted to use it to protect themselves. Unfortunately, it was also heavily exploited by illicit actors. And crucially, this, at the time included the Lazarus group, which is the main hacking group of North Korea. At the time, they were looking to launder the funds of the Ronin bridge attack and in a very small amount of time, put about a billion dollars through the mixer.
00:14:00.410 - 00:14:44.654, Speaker E: As Kristen says, you know, we have to stop proliferation financing. It's a big evil that causes a lot of harm around the world. So in August 2022, the US government placed a sanction on tornado cash, its property related entities. And according to TRM analysis, this has caused an 85% drop in the volume going through tornado cash. It has been a very successful action in the way that pretty much all DPRK activity has stopped. That is not to say that DPRK to this day does not continue to use mixers, because it does, but they just don't use tornado cache anymore. And more generally, we've seen a 77% drop in illicit activity going through the mixer.
00:14:45.274 - 00:15:01.074, Speaker A: So that's the action that happened. And I'm trying to think about how to best frame this. And maybe. Let's go next to Landon. Coin center is suing the Department of Treasury in the US about their actions on tornado cash. Why are you suing the government?
00:15:01.894 - 00:15:49.524, Speaker D: Yeah. So I should start with a couple of sentences about Coin center. We are a nonprofit think tank in the US and Washington, DC. Our main mission is to defend the rights of software developers to write and publish code, to run that code, and to do that on open, permissionless networks and be able to transact privately as well on those networks. So we're suing OFAC and Treasury over tornado cash because tornado Cash is simply software that has been developed and run and is not controlled or owned by anyone. It's important to understand a little bit of the law where sanctions are only able to be levied on people and entities and the property thereof of those people. And Tornado cash is neither people nor is it an entity.
00:15:49.524 - 00:16:42.280, Speaker D: As a little bit of background, too, I was on Capitol Hill for the last eight years. I worked in the House for Representative Tom Emmer, worked on the Senate Banking committee for two years. I joined Coin center after they had started suing treasury and actually had talked to treasury when I was at Senate banking about tornado cash and why they sanctioned specific ethereum addresses. The rationale has kind of changed a little bit over time, but it, there's kind of a sticky technicality that they used where there's this list called the SDN list where you cannot interact with these people, you cannot interact with these addresses. Treasury at the time told us, well, those aren't actually the things that are sanctioned, they're just references to the things that the entities use. And so we're not actually sanctioning these addresses. We're sanctioning tornado cash.
00:16:42.280 - 00:17:24.854, Speaker D: That's not really how it works in everyday reality. Any of those things on this list, the US financial system cannot interact with. So it is a sanction on tornado cash, the application. And so that's why we're suing. We're suing because the US government doesn't have the authority to sanction something that's not a person or an entity. And then as well, for the collateral consequences, coin center and many other cryptocurrency advocacy organizations get anonymous donations, and tornado cash is a tool to provide for that type of privacy. So I don't think treasury anticipated those collateral consequences at the time.
00:17:24.854 - 00:17:26.674, Speaker D: And that's what our lawsuit is about.
00:17:27.374 - 00:17:34.566, Speaker A: Kristen, to the extent that you can talk about this, I would love for you to respond. What Lyndon said, are you able to talk about it?
00:17:34.630 - 00:17:38.358, Speaker C: We can't comment on pending legal actions.
00:17:38.446 - 00:17:41.674, Speaker A: Got it. Carol, are you able to say anything.
00:17:42.414 - 00:18:03.674, Speaker B: Since I was at the NSC when we took that action? Can't get into too many specifics, but I'll say that the courts so far have held up the designation that's been taken, and I believe it was a summary judgment. That's right. And as not a lawyer at Kristen is one, I think it just, it's a really impactful. It's a really impactful statement by the courts to so far support the action that was taken.
00:18:05.234 - 00:18:39.554, Speaker A: So maybe abstracting away a little bit, I'd love for you to put us in the seat of where you used to sit in Fincet or where you currently sit at the state when an action like this is being considered and help us better understand what you're seeing that raises sort of red flags or what the process is to go from, hey, this thing is a thing of concern to, hey, this is actually going to be sanctioned? What does that actually look like? Who are the parties? How are you deciding to take an action? And who in the room knows about crypto and what do they know?
00:18:39.674 - 00:18:43.962, Speaker B: Yeah. And would it also be helpful to kind of tie it to the 311 action? Do you think that just.
00:18:44.018 - 00:18:44.746, Speaker A: Let's get to that in a second.
00:18:44.770 - 00:18:45.362, Speaker E: Get to that in a second.
00:18:45.418 - 00:19:16.182, Speaker B: Okay, gotcha. Well, so, certainly, I think, you know, when you're using an authority like IPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers act, which is an incredibly powerful and impactful act, as is the Bank Secrecy act, both of those basically together create the majority of the frameworks for combating illicit finance, combined with also all the Department of Justice law enforcement authorities that come under title 18. For any lawyers in the audience. Sorry, my us code is better than my python, but I. I got a couple of laughs.
00:19:16.198 - 00:19:16.518, Speaker C: I'm glad.
00:19:16.566 - 00:20:26.464, Speaker B: Okay, so those, those authorities are incredibly impactful, and they're often meant as a tool of last resort when, like, this is, like, this is a national security threat that needs to be mitigated. And so when you have something like North Korea that is stealing half a billion dollars per hack in a sector that has either not prioritized at all or has had significant challenges, depending on which part of the ecosystem improperly securing their ecosystem, operating kind of as an open ATM, to Lazarus group, who has shifted mostly from doing things like swift hacks to moving to defi hacks, when they see something that is a. That is a major vehicle for that laundering and a preferred mechanism by that illicit actor, that's where these kinds of tools come to play. And so then you have an entire interagency, whether it's the Department of State, Department of Treasury, you have the IC, you have law enforcement, you have the entire inter agency, all working together to figure out what the right authorities are that can achieve the most disruptive impact, and then working together to do equities checks. And then ultimately, most of the time, agencies all sort of concur on actions that roll out, and then they move forward with something like a sanction.
00:20:26.504 - 00:20:26.944, Speaker A: Sorry, Christina.
00:20:26.984 - 00:21:09.182, Speaker C: So put a little bit finer point on that in realizing that we have an american and international audience. Within any government, there are various ministries or departments that do things. And so you have treasury, which comprises OFAC, which comprises Fincen. And so what they tend to do is through STR, suspicious transaction report. And if you're not going to remember that, remember something's not right is a good way to remember what an STR is. It's when financial institutions or covered entities reporting entities, flag behavior and say, this seems anomalous. And so when they do that, FinCEN can mine that data, because we get millions of SARS a year in the government and things will start popping up.
00:21:09.182 - 00:21:49.042, Speaker C: Or let's take the axie Infinity hack, 620 million. What you see there is, all right, we have people who have the audacity to launder on a public chain. We've got specialists in this and the DOJ and the FBI in the secret service, which also has investigation abilities. So they start following this money through and, you know, we build a package under, you know, legal sufficiency. And then three main, four main agencies come into play. You have treasury saying, yes, we have the information that says this is what happened and this who is behind it. You have the Department of Justice, which is going to prosecute that individual or that entity or that organization.
00:21:49.042 - 00:22:31.272, Speaker C: You have state department that says, you know, this is how that's gonna play in the international space. This is some of the collateral damage like you were talking about that we need to think about. And this is how we're going to message this to partners and allies. And then you have the NSC, which is the closest thing you can get to the president, that says this fits within our priorities. And so each one of those needs to go green. Right? So if the Department of Justice is investigating something and says, no, we're going to prosecute that, we're going to hold off on that, or this is important for some type of investigation until all those rights go green, until all those experts say, yes, this is what we want to do, then an action won't move forward. But it's about promoting accountability.
00:22:31.272 - 00:23:04.274, Speaker C: Any sanctions regime is up promoting accountability for people who have done things that, like we, as the global we serve, say are wrong. And I think that that's really important for people to get on. And as far as experts, yeah, the government has experts in all of this. So the people that are tracing this through the chain can keep up with probably anybody here at this conference as far as knowledge and intent. And so, you know that you find that the people that have passion for these issues also work on the government side, too. Carol and I can nerd out for hours about things. It's great.
00:23:04.274 - 00:23:50.378, Speaker C: But at the same time, that's how we get to that space. And there's always that gut check. I think implicitly there's always a gut check of do we do this, or is this going to have a greater negative impact than it will a positive impact. A good example of this in working with partners and allies was bits lotto earlier this year. I don't know if people realized when we issued, it's a 90, 714 a action under the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act 2022. What it basically does is it says we can go after money laundering from Russia using powers under the USA Patriot act from 2001. When we issued that order, which was a big thing, we also picked up its founder in Miami.
00:23:50.378 - 00:24:30.822, Speaker C: The French seized their servers. And please go to bitslatto.com and see all the seals of the agencies that worked on that, because we shut that website down like that. And that is the power of us working together to go after a group that was laundering for primarily the Russians, but also any the people that the financial facilitators in between that go from the crypto to the Fiat or launder money, wash it, right? They don't care who you are or what you're doing. They just want to make a profit and they'll wash it for you. They'll probably ask how hot it is, it who's after you, and, you know, how much is it, and they'll determine the cut that they want from that, and they'll do it. So it doesn't matter if you are the DPRK, it doesn't matter if you're IsIs.
00:24:30.822 - 00:25:02.214, Speaker C: It doesn't matter if you just stole a bunch of money or embezzled it. They'll still do it. And that's who we're after. We're not after. Like I said, we don't want to stymie innovation. We want to work with people. But when we see bad actors, when we see millions being laundered, or billions, or of the majority of a tool being used for bad actors, that's when we will take action to protect the US financial system and the global community.
00:25:02.674 - 00:25:21.358, Speaker A: So I want to move to some guidance that just came out, I think, ten days ago at this point, where there was new guidance that came out relating to CVC's convertible virtual currency mixers. Am I getting that right? Isabellas, can you tell us what was in this guidance?
00:25:21.486 - 00:26:06.736, Speaker E: Sure. Another acronym that we didn't necessarily need, but there you go. So, following the various sanctions against different mixers, the US has decided that's not sufficient. And that this class of transactions, transactions that pass through convertible virtual currency mixers, are a primary money laundering concern. And that allows the US, even though we've got much better experts talk about this than me, to use parts of the Patriot act, which gives five special measures. The first special measure is around reporting and recordkeeping. So if this notice for proposed rulemaking is adopted, it's open for 90 days.
00:26:06.736 - 00:26:39.484, Speaker E: Please respond to it then. All covered institutions which are financial institutions. Crucially also money services businesses, which are what most crypto businesses are licensed as in the US. Also FX traders, broker dealers. It's actually quite a chunky list. Will have to identify when they interact with mixers, or when transactions they interact with have interacted with mixers. Record that and report it to Fincen, the body that does financial intelligence in the US.
00:26:39.484 - 00:27:34.272, Speaker E: Crucially, this is not a ban. It is what we call in the compliance space an enhanced due diligence requirement and very much to the credit of FinCen. It does speak about the legitimate use of mixers within the notice. It does say it's not trying to impact privacy, just trying to target and better understand this use of mixers in laundering illicit activity. I think one important thing to note is that although it is not a ban, though it is positive for, it is trying to be pro privacy. I think it is important to draw lessons from other parts of the financial of the history book, from financial crime compliance. These types of record keeping reporting requirements do place a burden on sectors, whether that be crypto or any tradfi.
00:27:34.272 - 00:28:03.734, Speaker E: Trying to work with crypto, which are expensive and expense related to compliance can lead to de risking, which is removal of access to services. So I think it is important when we all respond to this notice for proposed rulemaking that that unintended consequences is really considered, because that is often the other side of it. Any enhanced due diligence is undue burden on a sector that can create problems for access.
00:28:04.674 - 00:28:30.836, Speaker A: I'm curious, like Kristner, Carol, if you want to comment on that last point, either directly or sort of more broadly about how the government, when there is sort of a new rulemaking that comes out, thinks about the unintended consequences and in particular the cost, I think in the audience are a lot of builders, a lot of entrepreneurs, pretty small companies. And so how do you calibrate sort of things, the burden of new rules, versus sort of making sure that you're protecting national security.
00:28:30.980 - 00:29:16.048, Speaker C: So I do want to read, I'm going to read verbatim part of that rule. You can find it on FederalRegister Dot gov Dot. And so in this publicly, we state to the entire world, the United States supports innovation and advances in digital assets and distributed ledger technology for financial services, full stop. We must also consider substantial impacts that the technology has for national security and mitigate the attendant risks for consumers, for businesses, national security, and the integrity of the broader us financial system. That is what we say publicly. And when it comes to de risking, so you're broadly within my office, my day to day job is so I cover the financial task force from a foreign policy angle. But I also do de risking.
00:29:16.048 - 00:29:59.674, Speaker C: And a two second aside. So how we define de risking in the banking context, it means exactly the opposite of what the business world means. And so what we say when we say de risking is it's a refusal to even consider and manage the risks. So it's when a financial institution that provides access to us dollars, there's several ways you get access to the US dollar. And part of it is being an american bank, but part of it is having that relationship with an institution that has access to us, to dollars. When they refuse to manage the risk, they say, I'm not even going to try. This is too hard for me, as opposed to I have tried and like, I can't manage the risk.
00:29:59.674 - 00:30:26.640, Speaker C: We call it appropriate risk mitigation. So it's that refusal to try and to the point that there is cost, I mean, there's always cost to doing business. And so it's getting that right. It's getting, it's saying, you know, even banks themselves aren't charities. There's costs running your account. You will probably all have accounts fees. And if you don't, for whatever reason, type of a bank account you have, you know, there are still costs for this and there's costs for management of that.
00:30:26.640 - 00:31:12.930, Speaker C: And so it will never be a cost free thing. And nothing in the financial, there is no such thing as a free lunch, to quote economists. And for anybody that has an economics background. So that's something that's getting balanced. And what I want to point out in the NPRM, it's open till, I want to say, January 22, 2024, you can comment publicly, publicly or privately as private individuals, and we would encourage you to. But in that NPRM, there's like a through f. And there's a whole bunch of questions under there that talk about, you know, are we getting this right? Do we have the definitions right? What are the impacts that it will have on you as an entity or you as a business? Some of those questions may not apply to you, but there's 60 odd questions that we genuinely want feedback on.
00:31:12.930 - 00:31:38.756, Speaker C: When I checked it yesterday, there's already been 162 comments submitted. But that doesn't mean that, you know, you shouldn't still submit. We are wanting to engage with the community, and we wouldn't have issued a notice of proposed rulemaking saying broadly, we're thinking about this. This is what we are thinking about doing. If we didn't truly want to work with the community in the financial spaces. Carol, you likely want to say something.
00:31:38.860 - 00:32:02.770, Speaker B: Yes. Like, if I may, like, because I agree that FincEn understands that risk mitigation doesn't mean risk elimination. It's also not complete ignoring of the risk. And I'm going to speak back to something that you mentioned and the traceability issue that we talked about. So, yes, swift fed wire chips, those do not publish to public ledgers. Right. But I'll say that also cash takes crudely, I'll just say it takes time and space and physics to move from point a to point b.
00:32:02.770 - 00:32:46.266, Speaker B: There are ways to detect large pallets and suitcases full of cache, and there's mechanisms for doing that slow. It's cumbersome, it's costly. Crypto can send that wire transfer from my pocket to yours, anywhere in the world without needing a regulated intermediary. Hence why, let's say it's maybe a wash on the risk with cash, public traceability, but instantaneous value transfer with something like mixing. This is where you remove potentially that capability, that benefits of risk mitigation that you get through public ledgers and an obfuscation. So to me, this is a risk mitigation measure. The fact that they didn't use special measure five, which is their biggest hammer, the one that would have been a prohibition, and instead use special measure one, like you mentioned, which is just recordkeeping and reporting.
00:32:46.266 - 00:33:53.636, Speaker B: And FinCEN, in the information that they've proposed to be reported, is consistent with best practice, customer identification information that should be collected and totally consistent with the kind of digital indicators that are totally visible from these companies that are all operating digitally, and that FinCEN also published all of these factors about the risk presented by mixers, the fact that they were unregistered money transmitters that were operating and facilitating lots of money laundering in their advisory in 2019, taking this action four years later is an indication that the sector has not mitigated that risk. Therefore, FinCEN has embodied that in this designation, but still in a balanced way, asking for public input and asking for insight. Because, yes, the definitions are pretty broad and I suspect that they'll probably end up being pretty narrowed. I'm very looking forward to whatever coin center and others submit in response to these, because coin center always and others always submit really thoughtful feedback on these nprms. But I really would encourage people to consider that. I think that this is meant to be a balanced approach on taking this kind of measure by FinCEN. I think it was done in one of the nicest ways that FinCEN could.
00:33:53.660 - 00:34:47.827, Speaker C: Take an action and to be clear, what is being asked for is, you know, completely congruence with the risk based approach on AML CFT that covered financial institutions already do. We're asking for the same information that is already being collected by, you know, traditional financial institutions. And as pointed out and buried deep in the text, if you haven't chance to read it, is that there are no registered CVC mixers in the United States States, full stop. There are none. So it begs the question, either there are some and they're operating unlicensed or there just aren't any. And so, you know, that is the foreign risk that we are attempting to mitigate are these things outside that are introducing, you know, the US dollar denominates north of 75% of global trade and north of, I want to say, like 80, 85% of debts held in the world. So, you know, that is why the US dollar is important to this in.
00:34:47.827 - 00:34:55.167, Speaker C: And that is why we took this action, too, and proposed these rules, is because it eventually will probably come into us dollars.
00:34:55.335 - 00:35:34.844, Speaker A: I really appreciate both your being here, especially you, Kristen, who's currently sitting in the offices of government, because it's not always easy to go in front of a bunch of people who are in blockchain and talk about some of the actions that you've taken that I think people in the space feel are adversarial. And hopefully this is sort of a good learning opportunity for people to understand sort of what it's like to be in your shoes and your former shoes. Landon, I'm curious, as you hear this back and forth about the risk based approach that FinCEN and other government actors take on this, what was going through your mind as Carol and Kristen were talking about the measures in this particular piece of guidance and whether or not they feel reasonable to you as a privacy advocate?
00:35:36.264 - 00:35:37.256, Speaker D: Yeah, I can give my thoughts.
00:35:37.280 - 00:35:37.488, Speaker B: First.
00:35:37.536 - 00:35:48.034, Speaker D: I'm kind of curious, Kristen, it seemed like you thought there might be more outrage about this action. What has been your sense of the crypto community's reaction to it?
00:35:48.154 - 00:36:00.258, Speaker C: So, to be fair, when we dropped it on October 19, I left for Paris on October 2021, and I've been in a bubble since. So if anything big has happened in the last however many days, I don't know.
00:36:00.306 - 00:36:03.146, Speaker B: Okay, to be fair, to be fair.
00:36:03.210 - 00:36:10.958, Speaker C: But I also message this to every embassy out there. The same points are being delivered to every government in the world.
00:36:11.046 - 00:36:42.004, Speaker D: Yeah, I think our industry is really good at expressing outrage at everything that happens. And it seems like this one has been a little bit more muted. And I think that's relatively appropriate. The definition of mixers does include software developers, which I think is an issue. And it is, as Carol said, probably an overbroad definition that will be constrained. But it's important to note that it doesn't put any new obligations on software developers or mixers themselves. It's reporting requirements for financial institutions.
00:36:42.004 - 00:37:11.400, Speaker D: So in the context of what could have been done, things could be much worse. To Isabella's point, there is going to be some de risking and some moving of the traditional finance system away from these things, which is, in my opinion, generally bad. But it is important that there is time for notice and comment and that it is just a reporting requirement when things could have been much worse.
00:37:11.592 - 00:37:40.158, Speaker A: I want to shift to an optimistic note, which is, we've talked a lot about government. The things you can't do if you're in crypto, right? Is a crude way of putting it. Isabella, I know you're really passionate about a topic that I'm passionate about. What can we do? So what should the industry be doing to try to be proactive when it comes to illicit finance? And I'd love for you to talk about what that looks like. Obviously, TRM is doing a lot there, but we'd love for you to riff on solutions totally.
00:37:40.206 - 00:37:57.698, Speaker E: Well, I was going to come here today and ask you all to go and build us a solution that allows us to have compliant transactions that are also private. But it turns out that Solana has already done that with your plug for token 2022. Yeah, that's great. With your new confidential transactions. Is that what we're calling it?
00:37:57.786 - 00:37:58.706, Speaker A: Confidential transfers?
00:37:58.730 - 00:38:38.500, Speaker E: Yeah, confidential transfers. And I think that's really the crux of the issue. Right. Right now, our only solutions to AML is block lists and then sometime, which is saying, no, you can't have access to that if you're this type of person. But it turns out that really doesn't work very well in crypto because I can just spin up another 100,000 addresses. So then you have the idea of allow lists saying this person has a verified credential that says they can interact with various different things, which is interesting, but doesn't always fulfill privacy requirements. Just really depends how it's built.
00:38:38.500 - 00:39:14.444, Speaker E: But things like confidential transfers, I think gets us quite a lot of the way in terms of we're protecting the privacy that is required by users we have access access to, in theory, depending on how it's configured to authorities who, when they need to have access to identity information or wallet address information, would have it. So in terms of solutions, I think this is all a great starting point. And we would just encourage builders to go out there, learn the financial crime system, because the anti financial crime system. Because it is so much easier to learn than crypto.
00:39:15.494 - 00:39:21.510, Speaker A: Sorry, I just want to clarify. The financial crime system is easier to learn than criminal. The anti financial crime system, the anti financial crime system.
00:39:21.542 - 00:39:42.774, Speaker E: So you only really need to read best practices. It's like, just read the 40 recommendations from FAStAf, read one or two mutual evaluation reports, you'll understand how the global community thinks about these issues. And then with sort of a builder background, you can then go forth and take that knowledge and hopefully develop solutions.
00:39:43.154 - 00:40:17.762, Speaker C: But to put one more on that, FATF itself has a virtual assets contact group where it's trying to talk to the community about these things. And so, you know, fatif dash gaffe.org, comma, go to their website, find the VA contact group, and read what they're saying about this space and find ways to engage. Like, you know, if. If you are in the sector and you want to engage and go to your governments that are members of and say, hey, I want to be part of the civil society aspect of that, because I think it's important to have civil society voices.
00:40:17.818 - 00:40:18.466, Speaker A: It is tricky.
00:40:18.490 - 00:40:31.746, Speaker E: I mean, I'm part of that group. It doesn't convene as frequently as I think the sector would necessarily like it to. We understand the fat up agenda is very busy, but you can always contact me and I can help you get more involved in that.
00:40:31.850 - 00:40:32.770, Speaker C: Go to Isabella. Sure.
00:40:32.802 - 00:40:33.418, Speaker A: Good. Isabella.
00:40:33.466 - 00:40:36.186, Speaker E: Well, because your governments have other things to be doing.
00:40:36.664 - 00:41:19.874, Speaker A: This is actually do a point that I want to close this out on. And we'd love for each of you to talk about, which is, I think a lot of people in the room or in the industry in general are often scared when you say, like, come to the government and talk to us, you know, when you welcome engagement. And so I would love to just, like, address some concerns. One, like, if someone's gonna come talk to you, are they gonna end up on some list somewhere where they get targeted? Are they gonna, like, raise your spidey senses? And two, really, tactically, when you talk about submitting comment on an MPRM or a piece of guidance that's out there, like, do I need to hire a lawyer to do that? Can I just do that myself? Is it possible for a one person dev shop to actually engage? Is that a reasonable ask?
00:41:21.094 - 00:41:55.364, Speaker C: There's a comment now button. So when you find it on the Federal register, I'd have a link for it, but it's really long. There's a comment now where it's literally members of the public. So if you wanted to comment as yourself, as an individual, or on behalf of your organization, you can do that. And we welcome that input on the 311 NPRM. But, you know, if you were to come to us and say, hey, you know, I'm seeing a lot of illicit activity in, you know, insert anything here that's not gonna put you on a list. In fact, we welcome proactive disclosure from the community.
00:41:55.364 - 00:42:16.848, Speaker C: You know, if you come to us and say, hey, please treat this as confidential. Any of the folks that work in law enforcement are on these issues, we'll treat that with respect, because, again, we want to work with the community we want. Sometimes, like you said, how many people understand this? Yes, just like in any organization, there are individuals that understand it and there.
00:42:16.856 - 00:42:18.032, Speaker E: Are individuals that don't.
00:42:18.128 - 00:42:29.044, Speaker C: So be able to explain it at what we say is a 20,000 foot level. But we do want to work with you, and we will, with the information, take the appropriate safeguards to do so.
00:42:30.584 - 00:43:09.390, Speaker B: Yeah, there's tons of different ways to engage with agencies. Agencies like FinCEn have innovation hours. The fatif has the virtual asset contact group, the White House. Before we issued the EO, we did tons of roundtables with industry and lots of meetings directly with them. There's agencies, whether it's state level and the federal level. And I know this is happening as well in Europe, that are holding things like tech sprints and setting up sandboxes, which are other ways to engage. I understand the fear of coming in to engage with regulators also a perception and a message that has come from part of the space that if you do walk in, I think, Amira, you made an incisive point yesterday, which is that if you're not at the table, you're on the menu.
00:43:09.390 - 00:44:00.492, Speaker B: Is that what I think we said yesterday? So I've heard that before, or I think generally those that engage proactively are actually the ones that are having the most success, I think, in trying to communicate with agencies what the real challenges are, what the practical state of the industry is. If there happens to be an enforcement action after or at or near surrounding an engagement, I would highlight that enforcement actions take a very, very long time. Often when you see them, they'll cite activity from five or six years prior. So I would say that it isn't going to engage with government that gets you on a list. It's typically violating requirements that you had as an institution. So I would definitely encourage engagement on all of these things, whether it's related to illicit finance or the AIEO that just came out was actually made a lot of reference to an EO that came out that's going to impose KYC obligations on infrastructure providers.
00:44:00.548 - 00:44:03.364, Speaker A: EO's executive order. So it comes out of the White House.
00:44:03.444 - 00:44:03.868, Speaker B: Yes.
00:44:03.956 - 00:44:04.244, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:44:04.284 - 00:44:30.624, Speaker B: Sorry. That's the way that the president gives directives, or one of the ways that the president gives directives. And so, given that many here might play more in the infrastructure space versus the financial space, there's other areas that need to engage and where the same perspectives, like those that we've talked about here, like the balance of burden and privacy, need to be engaged, like these potential obligations on infrastructure providers. So I think there's lots of opportunity to speak with them.
00:44:30.664 - 00:44:32.568, Speaker A: Last thing, and then we're going to go to final thoughts where that can.
00:44:32.576 - 00:44:54.872, Speaker E: Get kicked off very briefly. You can engage in Europe as well. Please speak to your local MEP. The anti money laundering package, crucially, with the anti money laundering regulation, is currently being negotiated, so you can actively help shape it. And you can also engage with me, co level two consultations via the European Banking association note Authority, EBA and ESMA as well.
00:44:55.008 - 00:44:59.444, Speaker A: Okay, two sentence, Max. Final thought will go down the line. Carol.
00:45:00.504 - 00:45:16.132, Speaker B: Proactive engagement. The sector can self regulate when you guys organize around best practices and businesses. And I think that that kind of maturity can be driven by groups like this and by real engagement and understanding of what the policy needs are as technical policy priorities.
00:45:16.188 - 00:45:32.230, Speaker E: So I think, yeah, innovation. Let's build the solutions, not just to solving financial crime in crypto, but financial crime in general. We have a huge opportunity here, more transparency than we've ever had in any other sector. Let's use it to design out financial crime.
00:45:32.332 - 00:45:32.850, Speaker A: Innovate.
00:45:32.922 - 00:46:06.744, Speaker D: LanDon, for a lot of the negative stuff that's coming out of the administration in regards to crypto, just know that there are people like Kristen and a bunch of other people in all these agencies that are actually really thoughtful and want to provide for the preservation of crypto and privacy. So just know that. And then I thought of this before I knew that this was the innovation stage. But innovation and consumer protection or innovation and illicit finance are not opposites. Innovation can help protect consumers and can help stop illicit finance. And that's a lot of what you guys are doing.
00:46:07.044 - 00:46:31.240, Speaker C: Kristin, I'm going to quote deputy secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo last week in London, where he says, our expectation is that financial institutions and digital asset companies and others in the virtual currency system will take steps to prevent terrorists and other bad actors from being able to access resources. If they do not prevent illicit financial flows, the United States and our partners will.
00:46:31.432 - 00:46:39.424, Speaker A: Ooh, dropping the mic. All right, guys, let's give it up for our incredible, incredible panel. This is true experts right here. Thank you all so much.
