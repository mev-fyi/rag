00:00:03.680 - 00:00:19.934, Speaker A: How's it going? Awesome. I'm Miao from raccoons. Today I'm going to share with you about Jupiter and how we want to grow the pie together. So quick. Show of hands, how many of you know Jupiter? Wow, awesome. That's great. Easy.
00:00:19.934 - 00:00:49.964, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So, you know, last year breakpoint, things are great now, right? But last year breakpoint, everything was melting down. Everyone's asking us, hey, are you guys leading? And then, you know what, obviously we didn't. And we said, fuck it, we double down. In fact, we did way more than double down. We committed to building the best possible decentralized trading system on Solana. And that's what we're doing for the whole.
00:00:49.964 - 00:01:28.776, Speaker A: We developed a whole new world class routing engine, we developed a whole new set of products, and we did two major iterations of developed tools. And I think as a result of all the intensive work, I think most people agree that we are the best aggregate in crypto. And on top of the aggregation, we built several really great swap products, swap limit, order and DCA. And we also have liquidity infrastructure for Solana. We offer full style APIs, key SDKs for key verticals, and also plug and play for you to easily put into Jupyter in your product. And we are one of the most used services in DeFi today. We process about 35 billion of volume, about 100 million transactions so far.
00:01:28.776 - 00:02:15.706, Speaker A: And then about 950k wallets have interacted with our Jupiter and we are the most used DAX one Solana, meaning that most traders come to Jupiter on a daily basis to trade, then also the most used service on Solana as well. And the vast majority of retail flow goes through Jupiter. We are also the most integrated platform. So most wallets, DeFi regressions and systems, or websites or games even use Jupyter one way or the other. So I want to share with you a little bit about what our core anchors are at Jupyter. The first one is the juke promise, which is very simple, best price, best token selection and best UX for users and developers. And I mean markets go up and down, right, and things come and go, right.
00:02:15.706 - 00:03:03.808, Speaker A: But I think if you keep on doing this day in, day out, I think there's always a very key role for us in the ecosystem. Secondly, I think we want to push the tanker limits of Solana because I mean, Solana is really powerful, right? But what use is a powerful car if you can't use it, right? So what we do is that. So we're the first to adopt the key Solana features, including local tables, which are really important for composability, priority fees for congestion, and token 20, a new token standard. So in all these cases, we would feel first to not just implement them, but actually adopt them to user and actually let the merger user use it even without them knowing. And the third thing we do is that we work really hard to improve the liquidity landscape in Solana is very powerful. So you have all kinds of new liquidity stuff, like Centum, Phoenix, Openbook and all the good stuff. There is no else.
00:03:03.808 - 00:03:32.378, Speaker A: So in many, many cases, we look at them way before they actually launch, to make sure that the moment they hit the market, they're dead. They get retail flow right away. And we think that's actually really important for improving the innovation landscape in Solana first. On the other side, we also work to make sure that any liquidity needs our partner have. We support that as well. So I want to share with you a few examples of our product that we think demonstrate this call anchor as well. So this Matis is the most advanced routing in Defi.
00:03:32.378 - 00:03:53.334, Speaker A: So what Matis does is one thing, it's really good at finding you the best price. Going across all the markets and finding best price, regardless of whether it's $0.20 or 1 million, we don't care. Solana is really powerful because nowhere else can you do such a transaction for a 20 cent transaction. No way. One Solana, easy peasy. The second thing was Solana is actually really fast.
00:03:53.334 - 00:04:36.209, Speaker A: Block times are 400 milliseconds, convert to 14 seconds. So Matis runs near real time to update the markets and routing and backend such that to keep up with Solana. The third thing is that Solana is one big multi state machine. I don't think people actually understand how important that is because that means that all the programs or tokens or games or users are on one chain. It's amazing because that actually means that as time goes by, the utility of Sonata, the utility for sonnets, increases and the US gets better because everything is on chain. You can execute one single atomic transaction across everything compared to those, if your blockchains are fermented, it will be like going to a new Internet every time you want to visit a new website. It's very painful.
00:04:36.209 - 00:05:04.258, Speaker A: And then the UX for other chains go down. But of course, the more things you have on the chain, the bigger the competition space. You actually need a routing engine that stays performance and can scale exponentially. And yeah, that's Mattis. So Mattis is a very foundational technology for Jupiter and like Page rank for Google. And then we think it will serve Jupyter really well for the years to come. And if you're interested, there's a really awesome breakpoint talk by my very tender teammates.
00:05:04.258 - 00:05:32.770, Speaker A: They were talking in 2 hours. So check it out. All right, so the next one, the next example I'll show you is, I think it's a really good example of composability is this one. It's like you can go from, whether you're doing one sol or 100 sol or million, it doesn't matter. You can actually go from sole to stakehold or the reverse easily. And that's because Jupyter integrates not just the AMM and Clovis, but also allow you to integrate directly. Stick the thing all in one transaction.
00:05:32.770 - 00:06:04.554, Speaker A: Thanks to an amazing integration by sanctum. The other way was too, by the way, big shout out to buffalo for the amazing tweet. Yeah, so this is actually really important because it unlocks LsT adoption by a trader because, you know, it can go to and fro extremely easily at the best price atomically. Right. And also, obviously also makes it much easier for Defi protocols to adopt as well. Next, we built a bridge competitor to make it super easy for them to build it into Solana. So it compares the basket between different bridges.
00:06:04.554 - 00:06:23.902, Speaker A: Well. And there's no way out. Only in. Haha, too bad. Okay. Anyway, okay, so also this morning we also announced that we are going to support native USDC on Solana. Basically when CCTV launches, we're going to allow users to directly bridge into Solana natively on Jupyter itself.
00:06:23.902 - 00:06:44.570, Speaker A: So we think that'd be great. And so it's powered by Wungho and Circle, obviously. Hey, come on, come on, let's go. Liquidity. Yeah. One important thing for me is the Jupyter developer week last week, where every week we release an update API. Jupyter for payments, Jupyter for games, Jupyter terminal v two.
00:06:44.570 - 00:07:08.098, Speaker A: All those things are really awesome. Check it out. If you're a developer, I want to showcase example here called Jupyterminal. Basically it's awesome because you press a few buttons, the code changes and you copy and paste your website. And there you go. The best swap experience on your website for few clicks. How awesome is that? So big shout out to Dixon from my team because I promised him I'll show this.
00:07:08.098 - 00:07:35.734, Speaker A: So I did. Yeah. All right, so what's next? What is next for us? So now that we completed all these things, that what's next? So it's quite simple for us when it helps sauna grow, aka grow the sauna PI. And why don't do grow sample pie? Because you know if the pie grows, then everyone gets pie, right? I get pie, you get pie. Totally gets pie. My mom gets pie. So we're happy, right? All the pie.
00:07:35.734 - 00:07:59.396, Speaker A: And on the most serious note, we are one of the leading platforms on Solana. So if Solana grows, we grow too. It's no brainer. So what does it actually mean to grow the sauna PI? It means more users, more great tokens, more use cases, more capital on chain. Because capital on chain is infinitely more productive and safe than capital off chain or start and start exchanges. Capital off chain doesn't do anything for us, guys. It doesn't.
00:07:59.396 - 00:08:26.356, Speaker A: We need capital on chain and use it, to stake it, to use it, to lend it, to buy coins, whatever. We need capital on chain. That's important. So capital. Today we're really happy to announce three key ecosystem initiatives. The first one is something that actually, honestly, long time coming since we launched two years ago. People are asking when, when, when? Right? Hey.
00:08:26.356 - 00:08:40.744, Speaker A: And then we've always been saying soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon. So after suning for two entire years, right. I'm really happy to share that. Juke is now. Woo. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
00:08:40.744 - 00:08:57.960, Speaker A: Okay. Thank you, everyone. Okay, awesome. Let's go. All right. So why not? So why not? So the first reason why now is because I think finally, finally we have a long term and high linkage user base, right? And it's not just engaged. So we went through adversity.
00:08:57.960 - 00:09:11.284, Speaker A: They saw all the bugs, they saw the crushes and everything. And it's really important. It's not just for Jupiter. I think every project, before they launch a token, they should have a user based community that went through shit with them. I think it's very important. And we didn't have that the first cycle. No, we didn't have that.
00:09:11.284 - 00:09:35.564, Speaker A: So I want to make sure that this time around we have it right. And second round obviously wrapped up a whole set of major platform upgrades. And so we feel extremely ready to take on new challenges. Right. Thirdly is that there's a whole pipeline of ecosystem projects that want to work together with everyone on. And last but not least, I think we think 2024 is the year for the Solana ecosystem and for real this time. And it's not because of the pump, guys.
00:09:35.564 - 00:09:59.838, Speaker A: We have been working on it for a long time. Yeah, but we think the time is soon and we want to be helpful to help grow the ecosystem. Okay, so Joop is the governance token for Jupiter. It will govern all the key tokenomics, right. Including debt, liquidity, emission plans, sanction. Key token means, right, you know, and vote for key ecosystem initiatives, right. And then components, 40% community growth or foreigners are airdrop.
00:09:59.838 - 00:10:20.230, Speaker A: Airdrop. All right, let's go. And the token sale of token sale and 40% for the team and strategic reserve. It will be vested and locked so everyone gets pipers, you know? Right? Yeah. Okay, launch phases. The first phase will be to run Airdrop and token sale. It will be for establishing a really important base, right.
00:10:20.230 - 00:10:50.038, Speaker A: And the DAO form and the DAO can work together to figure out when to launch a token. Because it is not just my token or your token, which is our token. So let's figure out how to do it together, you know? So. All right, so the committed airdrop will be for current users and community contributor. It will be probably Crypto's largest organic airdrop with 950K users who actually used it before. It'll be extremely focused on users who actually have inconsistent throughout these very difficult two years. At this point in time, I would say to a community and users, thank you so much.
00:10:50.038 - 00:11:35.684, Speaker A: We talked about juke promise earlier, but the juke promise is not possible if you guys didn't tolerate all our downtimes, give us all the feedback and give us shit when we did something wrong. And also, obviously share promoted us on Twitter towards our friends. So thank you so much for all your help and we are really, really excited to work with you through on the next phase of Jupiter. Yeah, so the next question that a lot of people in the live stream are probably wondering is what's the criteria? So over here is where I think I want to share something. I don't think this is not my airdrop, it's our airdrop. So I don't think we should be determine the criteria ourselves. So after this announcement, there'll be a two week consultation period.
00:11:35.684 - 00:11:52.888, Speaker A: Just talk together. We'll share with you guys the different constraints and how we think about the airdrop. You tell us what you think and we'll propose something soon. Sounds fair. Fair, that's good. But let's do it together. Next is the growth airdrop where when the reward trading on Jupiter and Solana.
00:11:52.888 - 00:12:13.962, Speaker A: The whole point here is that we want to drive. I think it's a great timing because there's so much really awesome improvement on Solana. We know it, but they don't and a lot of new tokens that come out. They are really good this time. I know a lot of them, they're really good. So all we want to do here is very simple. We want to give the wider ecosystem one more simple reason to come check it out.
00:12:13.962 - 00:12:47.550, Speaker A: I just want to do, and obviously we want to grow the user base for Jupyter and Slana as well. On chain liquidity. Let's go. Let's restart the public sale market. We want to be as equal as possible, know what listing or access, and it will be locked so the DAO can decide on the exact lock unlock together later. So I think why do we do it this way? Mainly because we are not really concerned about the launch itself, we are concerned about what happens after the launch. So high initial float, we want to have a highly distributed set of stakeholders to build Jupyter together with, to launch with.
00:12:47.550 - 00:13:26.924, Speaker A: And we also want a very robust DAO to make change together because the DAO is going to be deciding on really important tokenomic stuff. We actually want to make sure that it's as robust as possible as we have seen the last two months, if the doubt is not great problems. So I want to make sure we don't have that problem. And obviously along the way energize the ecosystem, get more investment in, get more users in, get more capital in, create more momentum for ecosystem tokens, and obviously create a really focused group community to improve altogether. So that's dupe. And to all the community members are users who use stars. We love you and want to build the next phase of Jupyter together with you.
00:13:26.924 - 00:13:56.204, Speaker A: Thank you. All right. Okay, so the next initiative we want to announce is Jupiter start. So Jupyter start is a year long initiative to really help great new projects win on Solana. And along the way we want to reinvent the totally broken token launch mechanics that we see today. And in doing so, we want to help establish Solana as the most trusted ecosystem in crypto. And then I think it's really huge if you do that.
00:13:56.204 - 00:14:28.210, Speaker A: Sorry, I missed the slide. Haha, but I missed the slide. So Jupyter Stack is a technical and community platform. There will be three main components, Tokenspark, where they educate everyone about new tokens. So if you're launching a new token and you think you're awesome and you want to know about it, tell us, we'll figure out. And then the launch pad, I want to make one that actually works for the long term health of the ecosystem. And thirdly is public sheeting, which is one to help communities get involved in new projects very early on and work with them side by side, way before the token.
00:14:28.210 - 00:15:03.424, Speaker A: So why Jupyter? So Jupy Ag is the default destination for traders. We think the community and user base you're building is highly synergistic to new projects and we want to have the drip down to make decisions together to avoid a lot of the weird conflict of interest issues, right. That we've seen in other projects. Also the ethos, okay, so 100% transparency, so no weird opaque decision making. You'll be focused on long term health of the ecosystem and not the hype. Die, hype, die, hype, die. You know, I think that cycle of hype and dying, I think is very bad, not just for slaughan of our crypto, right? So we want to change that, right? And thirdly, it's a very clear alignment of interest.
00:15:03.424 - 00:15:30.584, Speaker A: So, you know, there is no, I think so no more of that. You need token a to buy token b. That kind of stuff is weird, you know. And then lastly, it's like when the help projects build real user community, right, not the, not the influencer launch, I think, whereby they built a one day community, right? You know, communities for one day launch and die, you know, so no, no, we aren't doing that. So anyway, we think that if we can do that, right, it will be a really good thing, not just for Solana, for crypto. And we can't do this alone. It's a very hard problem.
00:15:30.584 - 00:15:55.248, Speaker A: Right. So we know there's a lot of experts out there, community experts, equation experts, token experts. So let's do it together. Let's do it. And if you do that, then we can make Solana the most trusted ecosystem, I think. All right, so next one is JupyterLabs, where we are going to announce two new things we're working on and we want to build the DeFi protocols together with everybody. So the first one is the perks training protocol and the beta is available on Jupyter Edge today.
00:15:55.248 - 00:16:02.872, Speaker A: So check it out. Yeah. Let's go, let's go. Yeah. Pump. Let's go. All right, so LP is a GMX style model, nothing new.
00:16:02.872 - 00:16:29.604, Speaker A: There we so go. Lp's can do. There's no negation risk. They learn from trading fees, swap fees, IPNL traders, dollar 100 X leverage with your price impact trade using token. And for Solana, I think for Solana, I think every single, all the assets in the pool are integrated will be available for trading. So any asset in the pool will also deepen the liquidity for Solana as well. It's already integrated with Jupyter, so if you do a swap, it's very, quite likely that assets are already routing to that system.
00:16:29.604 - 00:16:44.808, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, it's in beta. Check it out. Next is that we're proposing a leverage stake, stablecoin Solana. We are proposing a leveraged stake. So stablecoin. So the way it works is very simple.
00:16:44.808 - 00:17:11.254, Speaker A: You put so in the protocol, like any other thing, the so will go into a leveraged sole position, because we think that is probably the best way to do truly decentralized you. Right. And so the U will go to the user. So as a stablecoin holder, you don't pay interest. Right. But you get u, then you also, probably also go to the protocol token. So protocol token can in turn be used to increase the protocol stability and capital efficiency of the protocol as well.
00:17:11.254 - 00:17:45.691, Speaker A: So in doing so, we want to solve three, aim to solve three problems, right? The U problem, the protocol stability problem, and the capital efficiency problem, right? Yeah. So we work on that and, you know, low feedback. This is a really good example of something that's only on Solana, because you need to have the very easy stick sole conversion. That's very important, the one I demoed earlier. And second thing is that this will cost a very high, you require a lot of transactions around the background, so if your transaction cost is expensive, you can't do it, you die. It's only possible as well. So, yeah, a stable coin, that's opos.
00:17:45.691 - 00:18:10.474, Speaker A: Let's go. For every lab projects, the thing is, there's three consistencies. Firstly, you want to improve it together. The user, the Jupyter community to approach that support. And there are so many experts in the swan ecosystem. Durden, Xuju, 89 reals, topo. I can't name a lot of people, but whatever you guys know, you're there, let's do it together.
00:18:10.474 - 00:18:42.974, Speaker A: And obviously, the incentives will also be aligned as well to facilitate this. In summary, what are the components of crypto? Too few users, too few use cases, too many rocks, problems. But at Jupyter, we don't see problems, we see opportunity. Yay. Let's go. So we think opportunity is this, we think that opportunity is that the Solana can actually be the most used, most useful and most trusted blockchain. Going back, way back to my first slide where we said we double down.
00:18:42.974 - 00:19:19.606, Speaker A: And there's a reason, because we think that Solana is the only ecosystem that has the technical basis, the strength of the ecosystem, and also the hard lessons. I mean, you don't improve some things you can't learn on paper, you have to go through that cycle. I think Solana is probably the only chain that actually understands cycle really well. Jupyters will help. So with Joop, we want to drive more on chain users and usage. With Jupyter start, we want to drive more, use cases and retail trust and with less, you want to contribute more. Awesome defi protocols for the space along the way.
00:19:19.606 - 00:19:45.770, Speaker A: We can build a future. We can build a future that we don't need success anymore. We can build a future where crypto is actually useful, and we can build a future where my mom can be proud of me for working crypto versus crypto. So that's my personal goal. All right, so, yeah, in summary, let's grow the pie together and we all get pie. We all happy, I love pie, pumpkin pie, you know, whatever. Yeah.
00:19:45.770 - 00:20:01.754, Speaker A: And then community consultation drip ag green. Check it out. Right? No, two weeks of consultation period where we go through the plan and discuss everything, discuss the airdrop mechanics, write with everybody and yeah, that's it. And thank you everyone for your support. Really appreciate it. And let's do it, guys. Let's go.
