It offers modular extensions, which empower builders to build new types of token experiences. Solana is the first network to offer this level of integrated developer and user experience in a single token program. And while capabilities of token extensions are advanced, implementation is straightforward. What used to take months of complex coding can now be done in minutes. With just a few lines added to your standard SPL token code, developers can make use of over a dozen new token extensions. Simply mix, match, and implement pre built extensions specific to your projects needs.
