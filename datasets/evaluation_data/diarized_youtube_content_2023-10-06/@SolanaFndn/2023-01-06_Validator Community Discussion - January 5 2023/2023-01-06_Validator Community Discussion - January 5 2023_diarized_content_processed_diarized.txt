00:00:01.400 - 00:00:42.944, Speaker A: All right, welcome everyone to the Solana community validator discussion January 5, 2023. Happy New year, everybody. A pretty light agenda today, so validator updates are going to be pretty similar to last time. No new clients have been released since last call. I'm going to talk a little bit about an educational workshop, and then I'm going to hand it over to the Gito team to talk about some background on the geo client and some setup differences between the Solana Labs client and the geo client. So they're going to take most of the time. So a reminder for validator updates.
00:00:42.944 - 00:01:13.254, Speaker A: Same as last meeting. 113.5 is recommended for Mainnet. There was a call to get 5% of stake on 114 ten, which has been fold. So we have more than 5% on 114 ten. I think currently they're waiting for some security audit, basically just to finish off the audit. So I think there's a little bit more work to do before they'll call for more stake or even the entire network to move to 114.
00:01:13.254 - 00:01:45.048, Speaker A: So for now, just stay on the version that you're on and wait for further updates. Same thing for Testnet. 114 eleven is the recommended version for Testnet. If you haven't upgraded already, please do. Any questions on either of those updates? Pretty much the same. Okay, cool. I'm going to kick off the validator educational workshops again for this year.
00:01:45.048 - 00:02:37.364, Speaker A: Um, we had a, like a good, tight group of people that were coming to the workshops previously before breakpoint. Um, so I'm hoping to get it going again. Um, the topic is going to be security for the next one, but if there's a topic that you're interested in, or if there's a workshop that you'd like to lead, please get in touch with me. Um, you can either dm me on discord, or there's a calendly link in every validator call that you can schedule a time with me and talk about what you want to talk about. But yeah, I'd really love to get more people involved with these workshops, either just proposing a topic or even leading one, ideally. So, yeah, that's all the updates I've got. Unless there are any questions about that, I'm going to hand it over to the judo guys to talk about their client.
00:02:40.044 - 00:02:43.716, Speaker B: Thanks, Tim. Gonna share my screen?
00:02:43.900 - 00:02:52.064, Speaker A: Yeah, let me stop sharing. There we go.
00:03:04.024 - 00:03:49.614, Speaker B: So, yeah, my name is Lucas, or commonly known as Buffalo on Twitter and Discord, CEO and co founder of Jito. We're building high performance mev infrastructure for validators and searchers on Solana. I recognize a few familiar faces on this call. Some people here are running the Jito clients. This shouldn't be anything new, but for the others, well, it'll be a learning, good learning experience. Yeah, basically been building GDA salon since August 2021. I think last time on this call, the team was, like, four or five people, and we're currently at eight people now.
00:03:49.614 - 00:04:37.704, Speaker B: We have backgrounds in distributed systems and then firmware robotics, and then back with some of the larger players in Solana as well. So I'll kind of just go over a quick product summary. Basically, we built a suite of tools to enable validators to capture mev revenue efficiently. So there's a lot of, like, kind of arbitrage spam on Solana that I'll get into later. And our client kind of unlocks more efficient capture of mev and attempts to mitigate some of the transaction spam on the network. The valid air client judo. Solana is a centerpiece.
00:04:37.704 - 00:05:28.898, Speaker B: This is a forka Solana Labs client, and we have matching versions for every version that Solana Labs produces. So we have a 113.5 tag and a one 1410 sheetotag as well. So, yeah, it's kind of a high level architecture of the way the different systems work. Essentially, there's a block engine that connects searchers and validators to together and kind of handles a lot of the simulation and things like that for the validator. So this is kind of like a super high level overview of what's going on in our block engine. Essentially, you know, where searchers are submitting different trades, they're tipping different amounts to the validators.
00:05:28.898 - 00:06:37.074, Speaker B: You can think of these, like, priority fees, except the validator keeps 100% of them versus 50% of it getting burned. Block engine does a ton of simulation, basically figuring out what's going to pay the most, and then submits those to the validators. Every validator has their own, you know, I guess, backing up every, like, there's been a lot of work that validators have done to try to attract more stake. We're seeing this with, like, you know, validators buying better performance, higher performance hardware, maybe making voting modifications. And I think that, like, MEV will be another way to attract stakers in. One of our, like, big thesis here is, like, MEV should be distributed to stakers. So there's also systems on chain and off chain that we built that will essentially collect the MEV for a given validator and distribute it to all the stakers as well.
00:06:37.074 - 00:07:32.744, Speaker B: Yeah, some of the benefits we can, like, we're expecting, like, roughly 10% increase or even more, with basically no incremental, like, extra costs from your side, MeV tips are currently low. We kind of have like a chicken and egg problem right now where, you know, we're trying to drive adoption of the validator client and drive searchers to compete in the system. And that's something that we're currently working on. So we expect that to get better as the client gains more adoption. And I'll answer that question in a bit. So validators customize their MEV commission, basically just like regular commission. And then there's a validator here.
00:07:32.744 - 00:08:18.166, Speaker B: You can see this is kind of like overview of, like, the MEV rewards on Ethereum after the merge has happened. We're also expecting, like, we're in this section, something we're seeing. We're seeing validators have getting massive stake inflows. Obviously it's not guaranteed, but it's a pretty strong differentiator right now since there's such a small number of validators running it, and been talking to a few of these staking websites and validator websites, and they're planning to highlight the Jito enabled validators. Please reach out. If you run a staking website, you want to show this as well. All this information is on chain.
00:08:18.166 - 00:09:15.594, Speaker B: We can tell you how to parse it, and then we also have APIs to provide that will show you the different parameters around this. Yeah, this kind of, some of the stuff I was alluding to earlier, there's been a lot of on chain activity recently with bonk in other DeFi related things. So we're kind of seeing this. Like, the blue line here is like the percentage of arbitrages that fail. So it's hovering right around 96%. And then we've seen a massive uptick in the percentage of MEV related transactions as a function of the non voting transactions, essentially taking all the transactions, subtracting the voting ones, and figuring out what percentage of them are MeV. And on a daily basis, it's around 30%.
00:09:15.594 - 00:09:56.774, Speaker B: And with a 99 or 96% failure rate, that's a huge amount of block space that's being dedicated to arbitrages or failed arbitrages. So this is like something that our system is hoping to address. Like success for us here would be much lower arbitrage failure rate, and the percentage of block space dedicated to MeV would be much lower. Should result in a better user experience for people that are trying to use the network. And then, yeah, I mean, nothing's free. Everything has risk. All software has bugs.
00:09:56.774 - 00:10:44.684, Speaker B: And we've been running this client for around six months across several of our own validators. And then there's 33 total validators running the client right now. And the client, the relayer and on chain programs are open source. We've gotten audits from Halborn and Neodyne. No serious findings in the validator. So we're feeling like pretty confident about that side of things. And then, yeah, like, most of the modifications that we made, they're really only impacting, they're only really running during leader slots.
00:10:44.684 - 00:11:25.978, Speaker B: We haven't touched voting behavior. We haven't touched consensus. If there's, we have like heartbeats between all of our systems. So if there's a heartbeat issue or something goes down, then your valve kind of disconnect and cut that code path, code path off. And then like, from what we understand, no validators have like switched our client and switched back to the normal Solana labs. And then there's, the hardware requirements are the same or potentially even better because it will actually kind of reduce the transaction load on your machine. So, yeah.
00:11:25.978 - 00:12:21.980, Speaker B: How do you run? It takes less than five minutes to switch. There's no like contracts, pre authorization, like forms to fill out or anything. Basically you, we don't have a build pipeline or software releases, so you have to build the client from source. And then there's a few extra command line arguments, things like what MeV commission do you want, what block engine do you connect to, what relayer do you connect to? Things like that. And we'll host weekly office hours that will pick up next week, and we'll announce that in our discord. So if you want to like set it up with us on a call, we're happy to do that and just give you kind of peace of mind to walk through any issues. And then, yeah, since November, that's when we open sourced it seen currently sitting at 8% of network stake running the client.
00:12:21.980 - 00:13:08.544, Speaker B: And last time I checked, it's 33 validators switched over Everstake lane and Chainflow. We run a few validators as well, and then continually talking to single operators, exchanges, and some of the validator and staking companies to have them switch over as well then, yeah, I think that's, that's all the slides I have today, but I think Brian sent this. Brian sent this deck out in the chat. We'll post it on Twitter and in our discord too. And feel free to check out the docs. Let us know if you have any questions. We're here to help.
00:13:08.544 - 00:14:14.864, Speaker B: So going to Zantetsu's question. There's all aspects. Let me just read this real quick. So the, I guess the point here is like, the way that we distribute or like the way that like, MeV is distributed and collected is a little different. I guess you can kind of play with the numbers however you want to get to like the commission rate that you want. And like the MeV distributions support a, like an MEV commission in the code which like the stake, the MeV airdrop will look at. And if you want to kind of go outside that, then that's certainly possible.
00:14:16.764 - 00:14:28.304, Speaker A: Just for a quick summary of the question, Zentetsu was asking why MeV is distributed to stakers when the validator could essentially change commissions and sort of accomplish a similar thing.
00:14:30.564 - 00:14:31.344, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:35.364 - 00:14:37.112, Speaker A: Just summarizing for the video.
00:14:37.308 - 00:15:26.772, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure. And the second question that he has is assuming that Jito Mev is not guaranteed by protocol, but requires some trust by stakers that validators will deliver the correct MEV as promised. Yes, that's correct. So when you, I mentioned some of the extra command line arguments earlier, essentially there's a few, there's some MeV distribution related parameters that are provided. And essentially you delegate the, you can delegate the like airdrop to another signer, so you can run it yourself or you can delegate it to a third party signer. We run the signer that uploads Mev data.
00:15:26.772 - 00:16:46.254, Speaker B: And then we also, we have all this data stored in Google Cloud and our team's working on dashboard for this right now, so you can actually verify it. So essentially all the MEB is distributed pro rata to every staker on your validator. And then someone else says all block packing logic is on GDO nodes. Right. Can you explain that a little more? I guess, like we, like the normal block packing logic is running in parallel to our custom block packing code that is also running on the inside the Jita Solana validator, our block engine does have some custom block packing or bundle simulation and bundle merging that we do to kind of figure out how much each bundle is going to pay and send you the most profitable bundles. But like, once those bundles hit the validator, all of that, it's called bundle stage. You can look at it, it's pretty similar to banking stage, but it's once the bundles hit that, then it is all running open source code.
00:16:46.254 - 00:18:24.934, Speaker B: And then Zantetsu asks, presumably the validator will prioritize the bundle TX's before other TX's that the validator packing the blocks. So yeah, we've actually been running into an issue with this today where our bundles are currently sent, they're like, they land on validators like mid slot. So running into issues where the bundles are hitting the cost model limit and not executing and being dropped. So that's something that we're trying to kind of rethink and figure out, like a good way to prevent that from happening. And, like, you can expect that to be like improved in a future release. Someone said, Solblaze sent the bundle stage link. Someone else said, I'm worried about centralization, I guess, like centralization from what standpoint? So, yeah, I mean, I guess like the current, we're trying to make, like Mev abstraction more fair to everyone.
00:18:24.934 - 00:18:39.204, Speaker B: I think right now it's kind of like a latency spam game and kind of like, who do you know game. And that's like something that we're trying to fix to kind of like decentralize Mev.
00:18:45.864 - 00:18:56.644, Speaker A: Do either of you have more specific concerns about centralization? Sentences question yeah, yeah, go ahead.
00:18:57.104 - 00:18:58.152, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's not, and this.
00:18:58.168 - 00:19:50.204, Speaker C: Is just speaking, you know, I haven't given a whole lot of thought to this topic. I'm just naturally a bit of a contrarian. So I always try to think about the things that I could challenge, you know, anybody with. And in this case, I think maybe Dimon and I have the same idea, which is that if, you know, there's a single entity that's sort of making some choices about priority of transactions, which is what's happening in your system, you're sort of asking validators to participate to, you know, to accept your transactions in preference to other transactions. That gives the Jito block engine, wherever it's running, some amount of additional centralized control over transaction executions with the possibility of censorship of transactions that wouldn't fit into blocks because Digito's bundles are getting preferred. That's probably, in my mind, the centralization question.
00:19:50.784 - 00:20:34.900, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess on. It's a good question. Like, from the point of, there's a few, there's a few things that we've done to decentralize this. One is building this relayer. So essentially, when you're connected to a relayer, the packets are hitting the relayer instead of the validator, and the relay will hold those transactions for a short amount of time, which basically gives the block engine time in searchers time to, like, solve for these bundles. And after solving for these bundles, it will attempt to send the most profitable bundle. Now, like, if we, like, we can't.
00:20:34.900 - 00:21:43.506, Speaker B: Like, we cannot censor things from the relay. We do run a lot of relays ourselves and people are using them, but, like, we don't want to do that forever, and we want people to not trust us and run their own relay. So, like, from that standpoint, we can't really censor anything from the point of, like, building bundles. The thing that we're trying to maximize for is, like, how much validators get paid, and, like, we will. We're always, like, striving to open source more of our code and more of our data, and that's something that we're working on between open source thing, like how much validators are making and how much stakers are making to, like, what bundles were sent and, like, how much they paid and things like that. Yeah, like, I hope that people, like, keep challenging on challenging us on this because, like, I think it's important to keep it in mind, but it's something that we're, like, working to improve as, like, we get more adoption and things get a little smoother running.
00:21:43.690 - 00:22:30.558, Speaker C: Yeah, if I can just. Michael Hubbard here has sort of made some points in chat that I think are directly to what I was saying. And in fact, his most recent comment is the concern. This kind of mev transactions only really make sense if you try to prioritize them first, because otherwise they can get ruined by transactions that occur before them and change the state such that whatever arbitrage and whatever was being accomplished is no longer valid. So it's only most effective if it's done early. And if you're selling, essentially access, well, not selling, if you're trying to provide extra means for getting access to early block space, that gives an opportunity for pushing transactions that are not in that category so far out that they might not even get handled by the validators. Normal transaction processing.
00:22:30.558 - 00:22:32.274, Speaker C: And that is the concern, I think.
00:22:32.954 - 00:23:19.874, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's like, the goal is to be very similar to the fee market that Solana has, like, the normal fee market that is, like, in effect today will kick out those same transactions. So I think the impact of it will be very similar. Oh, yeah. I guess Michael had another comment here. I guess another concern would be bundles consuming all compute units or block space for non bundle transactions get included. That is a concern. We have a few limits.
00:23:19.874 - 00:24:34.774, Speaker B: Like a bundle can only have five transactions right now, and then we limit, I think it's like ten or 20 bundles per block is like our kind of artificial limit right now. So, like, as we get more usage in the system and start to see how it performs, then that's something that we can kind of play with along with like the auction time. Like, when are we actually dispatching these bundles to the validator? These are all tunable, like in the validator itself and then also in the block engine. Solblaze asked, do you happen to have any open source docs available on how to get all the data about validators running the Jito client, like commission and revenue sharing analytics? We don't have any, like, good documents right now. It's something that people have been asking a lot about and something that we're working on right now. Zantetsu said, I've been approached in private by two or three private MeV arbitrage groups, and they always flaked out. Being a complete solution that isn't just vaporware is a big accomplishment.
00:24:34.774 - 00:25:25.272, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's kind of like the thing that we're trying to prevent, because I think, like, of course, if you're a searcher, that is the route that you would go. Try to work out some private deal. And I think that has the potential to result in more centralization. We're just trying to provide this technology to everyone, whether it's the block engine, the relayers, Searcher APIs, and then also our shred stream product, which provides fast access to shreds for RPC servers. Cool.
00:25:25.328 - 00:25:27.684, Speaker A: Any other questions for Lucas and Judo?
00:25:32.904 - 00:26:04.944, Speaker B: Feel free to stop by our discord. Someone sent it out in the chat discord. GG. Happy to answer any questions and talk. Mev, final question from someone in the chat. Are there any minimum stake recommendations? There's no minimum stake recommendation. The only requirement to connect to a block engine or a relayer is that you're on the leader schedule.
00:26:04.944 - 00:26:14.024, Speaker B: It doesn't really make sense for RPC servers or like random people to connect to them. So we do a check to make sure that you're on the later schedule.
00:26:29.804 - 00:26:51.814, Speaker A: So a comment there from Solblaze incentivizing you to run the judo client because you also get delegation from Judo Soul. So good to know. Yeah, soul Blazer. Maybe somebody from Judo Zentatsu is asking how much from a delegation.
00:26:53.674 - 00:27:25.614, Speaker B: So I think the, that's probably, probably better to talk about that offline, but there's currently, I think it's 24 validators in the state pool and 378,000 sol staked. And it's a naive algorithm that's just distributing everything evenly right now, and that won't be like that forever. But I don't want to give like, too much away on that.
00:27:25.774 - 00:27:31.194, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah. So get in touch with judo if you're interested in setting up a client.
00:27:32.974 - 00:27:34.310, Speaker B: Uh, cool. All right.
00:27:34.342 - 00:27:39.774, Speaker A: Well, thanks, Lucas. Thanks, Jito. And, uh, I'll see you all in two weeks at the earlier time.
