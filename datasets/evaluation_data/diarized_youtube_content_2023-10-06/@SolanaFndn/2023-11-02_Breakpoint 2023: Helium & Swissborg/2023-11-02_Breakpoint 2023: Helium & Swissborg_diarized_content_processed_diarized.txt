00:00:01.520 - 00:00:06.462, Speaker A: Hi, guys. My name is Cyrus Fidel. I'm a proud founder and CEO of Swissborg OEC here at Sierra Vue.
00:00:06.518 - 00:00:10.634, Speaker B: And here, I'm Nicholas. I'm Swissborg CTO.
00:00:11.334 - 00:01:17.020, Speaker A: So talk a bit about Swissborg. So those who don't know what Swissborg is about, we did an ICO six years ago, which was to promote financial freedom for everyone. Since that, we always try to bring the off chain world and the on chain world and how we merge it together. And today in this presentation, we're going to exactly show how we get the best of the both worlds and how we build only opos with Swissborg. So what have we done with Swissborg since our ico? We have created an app that is one of the best wealth management crypto app we have, essentially, in Europe, enables almost a million people, actually, to get to buy, stake, trade, and build their wealth through Swissborg. And what we have as well built is one of the best way to on ramp or off ramp any type of people. In Europe today, we have over 17 currencies that you could go from one fiat to your favorite token within a click.
00:01:17.020 - 00:01:33.632, Speaker A: We strongly believe that in the next cycle, we'll be onboarding million and million people. And I think. So this is something that is going to definitely change for Swissport and as well for Solana. So, Nicolas, how do we get listed on Swissport?
00:01:33.768 - 00:02:47.774, Speaker B: So this is a very good question, and to be listed on Swissborg. The very interesting part now with our integration with Solana chain is that, like, you need liquidity on chain, and to be able to provide that liquidity on chain, you can go on any Dex and typically work with permissionless automated market maker, such as like Kamino, so that, like, your token is liquid, and then people can use it very seamlessly with our app. The very interesting part now is that, like, Swissborg is capable of merging all the liquidity that exists. So it can go from forex, centralized exchange, and also Dex. And any listing on swissboard then gets super simple, because typically, before the previous state of the art was that you would provide your token and the liquidity on the DEX, and then you would have to fill a huge form on centralized exchange and find a market maker that would also provide that liquidity there. So that era is gone now with Swissborg, things get very simple for this.
00:02:48.154 - 00:03:31.078, Speaker A: Yeah. So to sum it up, really, what I think was great is that you really have the seamless experience that you have on centralized exchanges, but really powering it back with the blockchain. Right. And I think so this is something that's very important. More importantly, I think so what is really good for the community itself and getting listed on Swissport is that we have been in there, we have listed our own token, we have done an ICO being able to really grow our community members in Europe to get to that million people. And we have today for example over 50,000 people that are premium that stake our tokens. We have 17,000 shareholders that we did in our series A this year through our community crowdfunding series a.
00:03:31.078 - 00:04:12.688, Speaker A: So I think so this is something that is really remarkable that we like to promote, right? Because all here we're obviously big fans of Solana and definitely Swissborg is one of it. And I think so this is something that as well it changes the game to have bring real investors that are not only there for the investment for sake, but one as well build with that company and make sure that that token. Yeah, is a great way to get into it. Yesterday we were very excited that we finally did this oposs with essentially with Solana and how essentially we were able to listen helium token to. Do you want to walk us through how we did that? Yeah.
00:04:12.736 - 00:05:05.514, Speaker B: So a very interesting part of helium for people that are not familiar with the project is that like it's a decentralized physical interface network. So deep in that has launched a very interesting offer and for $5 you can get unlimited 5g access. So this is like the first time that like you have to a peer to peer network for five G. And as on Swissborg we have like a very loyal investor community now they can access something that like coming from a different investment universe. So for our investors it's new range of token and we wanted to broad the scope of like investment capabilities on Swissborg. So this was like one of the core reason that like we wanted to list that token, right.
00:05:05.594 - 00:05:19.130, Speaker A: And I think so like in terms of other projects, obviously Swissborg we have quite a big vague of different projects that we're looking forward to list. There's definitely. What was your like Nicola, what would be the ones you like the most?
00:05:19.242 - 00:06:21.100, Speaker B: So the we decided to implement natively the Solana chain on Swissborg because we strongly believe that like everything that we've been seeing on Solana is a community that is packed with investors and amazing ideas. I have been a judge on the last Solana hyperdrive and that was like almost to 900 submissions and it took a long time to review all that. But from gaming to deep in projects to entertainment, social media and you name it and we saw that in all those different verticals, there's projects that are coming on Solana. And so we're very excited to be able to kind of list projects that have a bright future on very early stage. Do you want to tell us why early stage project could come on Swissborg?
00:06:21.252 - 00:06:36.754, Speaker A: Yeah, again, I think so. The verticals that we're looking at is definitely some in the DeFi. Because we know that, for example. Well, we were. Only way to aggregate a Dex was through Solana. Right. And that now visa is using it as backbone.
00:06:36.754 - 00:07:04.210, Speaker A: We're a bit using the training software or the trading network of Solana. So we're quite very bullish on DeFi, I would say, and all the different protocols that are regarding these essential financial applications. But there's more than that, I think. So the gaming is something that we've obviously pushed a lot. We have our own gaming guilds where people really play the games, and people that as well, obviously be investing potentially in these different games. So this is with Xborg, for example. So I think so.
00:07:04.210 - 00:07:11.254, Speaker A: These are the two big different things that we really looking forward to bringing in the Swissborg ecosystem.
00:07:12.114 - 00:07:19.778, Speaker B: So you mean mostly applications that are consumer centric, easy to use and that could have a huge impact for our community.
00:07:19.946 - 00:07:41.650, Speaker A: That's exactly that. And I think so. This is what we're looking on the long run is, again, we've been in this game now for seven plus years. I think so. It seems very short in terms of nine years. It seems very long in terms of crypto years. And I think so to curate this loyalty, this community that, again, we have, which is, again, 17,000 shareholders.
00:07:41.650 - 00:07:56.864, Speaker A: There's a lot of people. And up to a million Kyc years that we have in Europe. I think this is something that we could pass on with the purple love of Solana or this, to different, essentially, tokens that will be listed in the next future.
00:07:57.244 - 00:08:04.676, Speaker B: Okay, so do you want to wrap up this conversation and tell us what should people do?
00:08:04.820 - 00:08:37.322, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So, I think so. The big message here is that if you look at the sex cartels that has been driving this business, I would say for at least five years, a lot of things have been taken on a political bias, I think so. Swiss Borg, we really incarnate this type of free democracy where essentially, we want our community to choose the best projects that want to get listed. And I think so in the Solana community, there's a lot of people that do believe in this philosophy that's behind this transparency. I think so. We went a further step than any other sex.
00:08:37.322 - 00:09:14.958, Speaker A: And that's what we call ourselves, a mega exchange is how we really bring, essentially, the best of the world of sexism, but as well, the best of the world of Dex is to put them together to create this free mechanism where any project could be eventually listed and voted from our community to get listed on Swissborg. And then how are you using, essentially, Solana as a backbone to make sure that people are essentially using the chain? And eventually, these investors that get into these tokens will be using, essentially, helium or a lot of different other projects that will be on Solana and looking forward to it. Yeah.
00:09:15.006 - 00:09:17.022, Speaker B: And we're very excited to hear from you.
00:09:17.158 - 00:09:24.414, Speaker A: Great. So when I say o, you say oh. With Fitzborg. Thank you, guys. Cheers.
