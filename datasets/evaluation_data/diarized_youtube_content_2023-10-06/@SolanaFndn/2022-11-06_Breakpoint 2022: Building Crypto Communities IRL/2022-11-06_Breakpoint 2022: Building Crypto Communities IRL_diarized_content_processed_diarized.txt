00:00:00.320 - 00:00:43.642, Speaker A: Hello, everybody, and welcome to the big ideas stage. And welcome to our panel about building crypto communities in real life. And while building in real life communities might not seem like a big idea, personally, for me it's probably the biggest idea. And we've seen a lot. We have a panel here of people who are very experienced in this. We have a combination of Solana, multi chain, virtual, in real life. We wanted to kind of get a mix up here to share those perspectives, but we've seen so many different sort of communities pop up, like more recently in Solana, the super teams and the Metacamps and the soul meets and like, it's just been really incredible and super powerful.
00:00:43.642 - 00:01:08.428, Speaker A: And like, as Solana foundation, like, specifically as an organization, the more of these things that pop up and the more the community that takes this role over, the more decentralized this whole thing becomes. So with that said, I'm going to kind of pass it down the line and like, let everybody introduce themselves and tell them, like, what in real life or virtual sort of community they've been building and kind of why. So, yeah, awesome.
00:01:08.516 - 00:01:26.024, Speaker B: So my name is Colin. I work on the developer relations team at Solano foundation. And as a side project, I founded an ngo in Sierra Leone called Christex foundation. And we're actually building like a physical, in real life, in person school in Sierra Leone.
00:01:26.804 - 00:01:51.758, Speaker C: Hi, guys, my name is Justin. I'm the founder of Dapio, also Soulmeet. Shout out to Jim, my partners for Soulmeet. So, yeah, we started so meat about a year ago. We have helped more than 1000 developers already, even last this year, April in Taiwan, Taipei. We are the first ex hackathons for Solana. We had over 400 plus developers joining our hackathons.
00:01:51.758 - 00:02:01.262, Speaker C: We have inspired more than ten projects building it already. So it's a lot of work, but we're ready for the upcoming challenges.
00:02:01.438 - 00:02:29.624, Speaker D: Cool. I'm Kash Donda. I'm the Sherpa of Super team, which is a made up title that means nothing. But Superteam helps people learn, earn and build on Solana, primarily in emerging markets. So over the last year, we've been focused in India, doing a lot in terms of media, publications and university programs and outreach, creating bounties and grants, and then helping support builders as they do things like create word cell, shout out to Wordcell in the back, a super team project and a bunch of others.
00:02:30.324 - 00:02:34.784, Speaker E: Have you ever heard of Empire? Now, I think I did my introduction already.
00:02:35.684 - 00:03:04.742, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think, one, I was trying to think about how to frame this panel and I think one of the more important things is, like, we have virtual communities, we have in real life communities, but since we have the sort of majority of the panelists up here building in real life communities, it's like, what actually drew you to building an in real life community? And, like, why is that so important? Like, you can contrast this versus virtual or not, but like, what? Like, why the need to do this sort of in real life thing?
00:03:04.878 - 00:03:42.900, Speaker B: Interesting. To, like, a large extent, I actually had no choice. So I just spoke about this on the main stage, about what Krisik's foundation is about and building the school. But what I mean by I pretty much had no choice was in terms of the infrastructure that we have in Sierra Leone does not allow to have an online community. In terms of the infrastructure that we have, there's no area where you can get 24 hours electricity. Internet is ridiculously expensive. And even, like, the people who we'll be building these communities with may not even necessarily have the right equipment to actually participate.
00:03:42.900 - 00:04:09.434, Speaker B: Yes, it's a large extent. I had absolutely no choice, so I didn't have an option to choose. I was almost, like, forced into doing it. And I think probably, like, it'll be interesting to hear from the rest of the panel, but I think depends on what region you're in. Would probably determine whether and at least how you start, whether you start with a physical community or an online one. I think, yeah, depending on your region, the answer may differ.
00:04:09.554 - 00:04:10.242, Speaker A: Justin.
00:04:10.338 - 00:04:40.806, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I think the reason we started, so me, is because we found a Dapi about a year ago. We were trying to hire developers through APAC regions. It was very hard, honestly. We've been getting a lot of complaints saying that there isn't the right documentation for the new developers to learn about coding on Solana. So me and my partner Jim, we figure out if nobody's gonna do it, we gonna do it. You know, we started the first workshop in EPaC region, perhaps the first workshop was only six people.
00:04:40.806 - 00:05:15.596, Speaker C: We were like, God damn, are we doing the right things or what? And, you know, it just kind of took off on there. Like, you know, like Mike said, the community took over. Second workshop was 1424, 50, 80. At one point, we almost had 150 developers and our workshops learning how to do nFt, defi, and so on and so forth. So, you know, we love it. We love the culture that we're trying to bring to developers. And even for dappios as well, you know, we're doing unified SDK on chains, so we're ready to empower the entire salon ecosystem.
00:05:15.780 - 00:05:26.470, Speaker A: So for like the. So opposed to doing this, like virtually, like, was that ever an option to just do this 100% virtually? It was, yeah.
00:05:26.542 - 00:06:03.670, Speaker C: I mean, we actually recorded all the physical workshop we held and uploaded on YouTube. And the funny thing is that one of my developers would actually hire him through digitally, like, I mean, remotely, like, he lives in Tokyo. He found out the documentation we provided on Soulmeet and then contact us through telegrams that, hey, I really like your work. Is it possible for us to join Dapio? And it kind of like took off on there, like, and then he has friends in Tokyo that, hey, I joined these cool workshops in Taiwan. They have documentation written in English. Why don't we contribute it? So it kind of just took off on there, to be honest.
00:06:03.742 - 00:06:29.524, Speaker A: And it seems like everybody really likes the in real life sort of version of this to be able to meet each other and that. Yeah. And so, like, we have cash here. He's the only one on the panel that's doing virtual only, although like super team does actually have touch points where they do meet. But like, what for you? Like, how has it been for you, building out a completely virtual sort of community?
00:06:29.864 - 00:06:50.288, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's been challenging and easier in different ways. Right. So on the easier side, the friction to join a virtual community is obviously basically zero. And access is fantastic. So again, we're focused primarily in India right now. We have community members from like villages in Assam to major cities all across the country. So it's a lot easier for people to come and go.
00:06:50.288 - 00:07:35.580, Speaker D: And when I think about community building broadly, I look at providing context, contribution and then connection. So context, super easy to do online. You have onboarding guides, automations, blah, blah, blah, contribution. Again, really easy to do, probably easier to do online where people have time to work with the community at their own pace and fit it into their lives. But the connection piece is different, right, because it's easy to join, it's also very easy to leave. And so you have this kind of impermanent loss in virtual communities where people are active one day and then they just don't sign into discord for like three weeks and you don't know what the world's going to be like when they come back. So I think not having as much of the IRL makes it hard to build those strong social ties which are the basis of any good community, which is why we're trying to do more IRL activations now.
00:07:35.580 - 00:07:45.714, Speaker D: So we've helped out on some of the hacker houses. We'll have some permanent hacker houses in India next year during the. Whatever the next Solana hackathons are, and we're starting to move more in that world.
00:07:45.874 - 00:07:47.306, Speaker E: Yeah, if I can jump in on that.
00:07:47.330 - 00:07:47.970, Speaker A: Yeah, go for it.
00:07:48.082 - 00:08:13.800, Speaker E: I mean, as the guy who was pushing remote work for a decade. Right. I feel like the COVID has swung the pendulum too much to remote work. And I think there's a huge advantage right now to startups that are, I'm seeing with six to eight people every day, whiteboarding, coming in on weekends, and really crushing it, I think they have a huge advantage. I think the future is hybrid, so I wouldn't go. It's a great mix, but that's why I really got into it. I feel it's too much.
00:08:13.800 - 00:08:25.680, Speaker E: Some of the developer ecosystem leads. He said, our developers are 18 hours in a weworker in their mom's basement, and at Empire Dao, they're meeting other people, they're getting culture. So I really wanted to swing us back a little bit in that direction.
00:08:25.792 - 00:08:54.120, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, even at Solana foundation, we're globally distributed. There are some offices, and we don't see each other maybe for six months at a time. And, Mike, you and I were talking about this before, but we had a company on site last week or a couple weeks ago, and the amount of work that you get done in a five minute sidebar in real life compared to, like, that would take you, like, two weeks in slack to get through that. So, like, even, like, not even necessarily. Well, a job like a company is sort of a community in itself. So, like, it's very similar.
00:08:54.120 - 00:09:17.734, Speaker A: So I understand it totally. So I'll kind of open this up to whoever Colin kind of listed off the challenges that he had doing this in his sort of regionally based Sierra Leone, which is just, like, access to infrastructure and Internet and all that stuff. So I don't know if anybody here on the panel has some, like, some big challenges that they went through sort of growing these communities. I know there's plenty to go through.
00:09:18.034 - 00:09:20.734, Speaker E: So don't sleep in the offices.
00:09:23.714 - 00:09:33.090, Speaker A: Yeah. So did any, like, what were some of the greatest challenges in actually building the sort of physical versions of your. In real life communities?
00:09:33.202 - 00:09:34.050, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll start.
00:09:34.162 - 00:09:34.650, Speaker A: Yeah, go.
00:09:34.722 - 00:10:29.486, Speaker C: So when we started Soulmeet, there wasn't a standardization for a textbook of write how to code on Solana. So really dive into one of the few fundamentals that. What is Solana in a technical ways? Like, how can we, I mean, on board all these developers in just less than an hour or two, with the simple documentation for step one to step ten. So we took a lot of times, my partner Jim took a lot of time to figure out what does developer need to start a Solana. And then he wrote the first article on GitHub about Anchor. I think that got a lot of attention. And then he just figured out that, you know, this is the way instead of telling people how to code on Solana, we demoed it, we demonstrated through videos and then follow it on YouTube and follow our documentation on one on ones.
00:10:29.486 - 00:11:06.388, Speaker C: So I think that was probably one of the first limitations we had. And then I think second is culture. You know, culture aspects of our communities are extremely important. You know, we have, and I'm proud to say this, like, we have zero grants, is that we don't want to apply it because we have an SOP to empower volunteers to put in work to our communities. You know, we have over more than six contributors to Som's already, and these contributors are from different projects, different chains perhaps, and got convinced to join our communities. They really like this committee where, you know, we are trying to empower everyone, you know?
00:11:06.436 - 00:11:40.314, Speaker A: So, yeah, and I mean, like, you guys, I think, are probably like one of the groups that's especially on Solana that less people have known about because you've kind of just under the radar. I remember a few months ago, or maybe four or five months ago, I saw this photo of this packed room of a workshop, and I was like, who the hell is that? And they were like, oh, yeah, that's Dapio and Soulme. I was like, okay, yeah, I remember this. But Mike, you and I had talked about this a bit ago. You said basically, Empire Dallas consumed your life. That seems like a big challenge.
00:11:41.804 - 00:12:14.624, Speaker E: Yeah, it's tough. I mean, we want it to be 24/7 because people do work wherever. We don't want to be like, hey, it's three in the morning, stop working. So we will keep that culture, but with an IRL space and having worked in software for so long, you kind of forget that you need security and cleaning and things, and Internet goes down and the air conditioner goes out and, like, all these things that keep you up 24/7 so it's been an extreme challenge, like going back to the real world where I grew up in. It's been extremely hard from having that software mind and, like, we're just coding and then. Yeah.
00:12:15.124 - 00:12:16.620, Speaker A: Yes. Oh, go ahead. Yes.
00:12:16.692 - 00:13:15.702, Speaker B: I think it's actually interesting because I think it largely depends what you want to optimize for. So, like, for example, at the school, in the initial stages, I'm trying to see, like, if we can form strong ecosystem projects that are like birthed and based in Sierra Leone. And I think to the point that you're making, in terms of the amount you're actually able to achieve just being in person in the same room, it's a lot easier to do that rather than trying to do that online. So again, if you're trying to optimize for, let's say, a good community, a good working culture, I think going down the in real life route is probably optimal, at least at the start. But to what you were saying, kash, in terms of trying to pull in different people from different regions and showing them the opportunities, you'll probably go down the online route. But again, just that hybrid, I think, is probably the best in the long run.
00:13:15.798 - 00:13:46.494, Speaker D: I think for us, as we've done some IRL activations, it's really required more trust. I think creating vibes in real life is a lot easier, but curating vibes is a lot harder on discord. I can see every message, and every other community member can see every message and get a sense of how people are acting in real life. You don't have that oversight, not only just as a community builder, but people within the community. You can only talk to the people that are right in front of you. So finding ways to provide that kind of visibility and make sure that the vibes are actually immaculate in real life, I think is a little bit trickier, or has been for us.
00:13:47.394 - 00:14:39.440, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think one of the other things that I've been thinking about a lot lately, as we've been talking about these in real life communities and that thing that is scaling. So just to sort of paint an example, cash and superteam built this virtual regionally based community, super team Dao in India. More recently, Superteam Vietnam just launched. And that's also not necessarily a physical location. There's a few people, but it will be regionally, virtually, and then that could go on and on forever. But like, for these other groups, Colin, Justin and Mike, how in the world do you scale an in real life community? Like, you have physical limitations in this one location, it's really expensive to, like, there's funding that has to come in.
00:14:39.440 - 00:14:50.828, Speaker A: Like, how do you scale that? And, like, how do you even monetize to scale that? So there's a bunch of sort of questions in there, but, like, how do you scale that in real life community and be able to manage it?
00:14:50.876 - 00:15:09.668, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I can start riffing off of that. I think in terms of, I don't think scaling is a problem, but I think as you highlighted, there's like capital involved. So in a world, unfortunately we don't live in a world where there's like infinite capital, but in that world, like scaling these physical locations isn't actually an issue.
00:15:09.756 - 00:15:10.984, Speaker A: We can print more money.
00:15:13.044 - 00:15:57.524, Speaker B: So we already know that it's like companies who have like multiple offices like around the world. So like scaling globally physical locations isn't a problem. It's like, it's a problem that already has existing solutions. It just requires capital and I guess finding like minded people to actually run the physical facility in the various locations that you actually decide to launch in. So yeah, I think scaling is not an issue. It's just about finding the capital and also like finding the right people who can at least continue the culture that you started. That's what we're going to be one of the challenges in terms of finding the right people to actually continue what you've started.
00:15:57.684 - 00:16:01.964, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. So Mike, I think we kind of had some of the similar conversations.
00:16:02.044 - 00:16:31.936, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the vibes are extremely important, right. Of keeping people to come back and go. So I'm extremely hesitant to scale up and go elsewhere and let the brand dilute, if you will. Right. And also if we do, we've got some pockets of people starting little London and LA planning committees for like, hey, if you guys can build a community locally or you already have it, we can come in, but we don't want to come in and take over by any means. We want to activate the communities that live in their particular cities. But at the same time we're so early, right.
00:16:31.936 - 00:16:58.764, Speaker E: We're six months in so we're just figuring out like if we can do that or should we just do one location per year and go really slow? So it's on the table for us. I think it's going to be extremely hard for us to scale kind of like what we're doing, but also could be very simple in terms of open source dao type model where we're enabling like Solana spaces. That concept I heard yesterday was brilliant in terms of like activating, letting people activate the brand elsewhere. So I also see a path that like we could scale this up if others step up and do it.
00:16:58.884 - 00:17:22.204, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think Colin kind of hit on it. Like you have to find and like super team had to do the same thing within terms of Vietnam. You have to find those right people, the ones that just sort of understand the mission that sort of just are ready to go and you hand over a playbook and it really does take the right people to be able to carry on that sort of vibe, as you said.
00:17:22.324 - 00:18:10.030, Speaker B: Well, actually, another thing with that, I don't know how many people call the Solana spaces talk, and I guess they are in real life, maybe not community, but it's an in real life thing and they're kind of like solving the scaling problem with spaces. Now in terms of, you can now almost like choose to opt in to run a Solana space in whatever region you find yourself. I guess that could be an option for us who are building in real life communities, almost like a Dao or like a franchise model. In terms of if you wanted to run soul meat in Vietnam, this is like the playbook on how to do it. This is the blueprint that at least we followed. Adapt it and modify it to fit your locale and run with it. So maybe even the culture doesn't even need to be the same.
00:18:10.030 - 00:18:15.374, Speaker B: The culture can almost afford to be different because in different parts of the world there's different culture.
00:18:15.414 - 00:18:37.160, Speaker C: Anyway, I just want to add on to that. I think definitely, I think leadership's something that we're looking to scale in the next phase for soul meets. Our strategy is very simple, is that we know the next generation of developers coming to Solana are mainly going to be the kids in universities. So we've been heavily invested in our time into Solana textbooks.
00:18:37.232 - 00:18:37.664, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:18:37.704 - 00:19:17.244, Speaker C: So we haven't released this notion, but me and Jim been talking about we want to build a first Solana textbooks that are available for the space and for developers, for builders, for founders. So, I mean, again, we were looking for talent and for Vietnam and also putting just a pivot in there. We've been talking with coin 98 in Japan, uxds, quite a few protocols. They really like this idea of Solana textbooks that can empower anyone in any regions across the world. So, yes, I mean, I see a lot of talented people on stage as well. You guys are interested in scaling Solana textbooks or helping sell me, let me know.
00:19:18.784 - 00:19:45.606, Speaker A: Yeah, so cash, like, we've kind of been talking about challenges of scaling around in real life. What? Like virtually, I think we need to sort of do the comparing and contrasting is like, how hard was it for you guys? I know that super team is also somewhat capped in your scaling, but what challenge have you seen as the Vietnam stuff comes up and what challenges have you seen with that?
00:19:45.750 - 00:20:09.912, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know if this is a hot take or not, but I generally don't think community scales very well. Audiences scale scale really well. People are used to that because audiences are one too many. Communities are defined by the strength of the social bonds between the members. And as you add in more people, oftentimes you end up diluting that and the community actually loses some steam and power. So scaling communities, I think, is difficult the way that we're approaching it. We can borrow a metaphor from cosmos.
00:20:09.912 - 00:20:35.228, Speaker D: We think about super team as the Cosmos SDK. So there's a super team SDK. That's the layer zero. It's shared values, it's shared capital, it's shared distribution. Then we have these individual app chains in each of these countries, like India, like Vietnam, each have their own responsibilities around identifying talent, creating earning opportunities, doing IRL activations and so forth. So we're able to scale across multiple places in that fashion. But in each market, we want to keep it relatively capped.
00:20:35.228 - 00:20:56.108, Speaker D: This requires us to do things like churning members who are not actively contributing. But that's actually great because it kind of motivates people to stay actively engaged because now they have something to lose if they're not actually adding value back to the community. So it can be difficult. On the optic side, Superteam is not permissionless. You can't just join. But on the bright side, you can't buy your way in either. You have to work your way in.
00:20:56.108 - 00:21:01.904, Speaker D: But once you're in, you want to keep staying actively engaged in order to remain a piece of it.
00:21:02.604 - 00:21:30.902, Speaker B: I think what's also interesting is the alternate side of that. In terms of do we actually need to scale? Because I think unless you're trying to build a global brand, like, maybe Krissak's foundation doesn't actually need to scale outside of Sierra Leone. It's just maybe we can just provide the blueprint. Like, hey, if you want to do this in your region, here's what we did. Try it out, see if it works. But it's nothing to do with us. So in terms of like that, maybe not everything needs to scale.
00:21:30.902 - 00:21:36.398, Speaker B: You can just replicate, but put your own brand in your own thing on it and just see how it goes.
00:21:36.486 - 00:22:40.862, Speaker A: That's actually a really good point, because you're talking about, like, a brand such as, like, Sue super team and, like, empire Dow are a brand that sort of, like, are trying to scale their communities. But, like, for Chris Tech's foundation, maybe your idea is like, no, I just want to work on this one thing in this one place with my people, and I'll just share my learnings with like maybe other communities in Africa and they can just spin it off themselves. So like, that's actually a really good point. This is a little bit off topic, but I did want to sort of bring this one up, is like we have three people on the stage that are solely focused on soul and then we have Mike here who is multi chain. So I'm just really generally curious what people's thoughts are on that. I sort of have my own thoughts about what is more impactful, sometimes wider is not better than deeper. Does anybody have any thoughts on how that sort of impacts your community when you have like multi chain, like, and not focus solely on one group, if I may?
00:22:40.918 - 00:23:11.046, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I take it back to, I was, I bounced around a lot in my twenties, so I lived in five countries on four continents. And then you would occasionally hear the come back and I'd hear the American who's never left his suburb and be like, oh, that country sucks. Or, you know, it's like you've never been man. Like, you've never experienced it. And so last year, I'm a degenerate NFT collector, so I've got nfts on different chains and I wanted to be in like the monkey dow of all the chains as it grew. And I would hear the same ignorance on these spaces of people talking about different chains. And I'm like, you don't know what's going on over there.
00:23:11.046 - 00:23:43.486, Speaker E: Like, they have different features, they have different audiences that they're going for. Some are going specifically for the old school financial banks and that's going to be there. So as this entire planet shifts to this part, the tool usage will be all over the place in terms of what nobody can be a swiss army knife. If you are, you're not going to be the best chain. There can be no best chain. There could only be several in my mind. And then as a community, I think it really helps for us have, we're moving towards a more decentralized future together.
00:23:43.486 - 00:24:11.004, Speaker E: However we do it so we are legitimately. Anybody who trash talks in our telegram, we delete it immediately. Part of our core values is that we are open minded with each other, that we are building together. We're still early, right? Like, there's still a huge amount of population, all of it, that we have to convince that this is going to be good and we have to do it through solving problems. And if we have to solve problems on multiple chains, then so be it.
00:24:12.704 - 00:25:08.034, Speaker B: That's interesting. Yeah, I would like to add to that. I think for sure, maybe we can all agree that the future is going to be multi chain anyway. But I guess almost like, the questions we might have to ask ourselves is, are we trying to build a Solana community, or are we trying to build like, a blockchain or web3 community? And I think, like, as a whole, I'm bullish on blockchain in general. So, for example, if somebody theoretically, was to approach me and say, hey, I know your school is Solana focused, can you do some, like, ethereum courses? I'm no ethereum expert by any means, so if you want to come on board and provide that as a additional course at the school, I don't honestly see any issue with that, because the future is going to be multi chain. So how do we actually begin to, like, foster those particular learnings in different regions?
00:25:08.154 - 00:25:09.934, Speaker A: Right, yeah, that makes sense.
00:25:11.714 - 00:25:43.024, Speaker D: Yeah, I was going to say, I think that, like, doing the single chain thing is kind of like building a town or living in a town versus living in a city. Oftentimes cities, there's more stuff going on, there's more activity, easier to get lost, harder to figure out what's going on. So for us, being Solana focused only makes it a lot easier to understand what the people in the community need, what kind of connections they might need, and allows us to build those inroads on a smaller scale. So I don't think it's better or worse. I think it's probably a little bit easier rather than harder. That's just how it's been for us, at least.
00:25:43.144 - 00:26:06.288, Speaker C: Yeah, I can also add on to that. For Soulmeet, we consider salal as ultimate dares for non avian people. And we've been advocating salon. It doesn't mean we cannot go for multi chain push. In fact, we were approached by Optos and Sui in many ways that we liked our culture and communities. We wouldn't say noted. Obviously.
00:26:06.288 - 00:26:24.296, Speaker C: Obviously there are people that from our community have started on move already, but it's fine. Our job is to gather all these talented people in one place. And God knows there could be a product that empower Solana from Solana, empower entire move ecosystems. So we want to grasp and capture those values.
00:26:24.440 - 00:26:56.864, Speaker A: Yeah. So we're kind of getting a little bit short on time. And I guess I kind of wanted to ask everybody what's the what in the next six? Like, everybody's sort of at a different stage. Sierra Leone, the school was kind of really just calling, teaching people at his house right now, it's not even like the physical location isn't there. But, like, what are the next six months to a year look like? What is the sort of, like, where do you hope and expect to be like in the next six months? With, with your location or your community?
00:26:58.384 - 00:27:53.198, Speaker B: Cool. I'll kick off. So I guess in the next six months, essentially what I'm trying to achieve in Sierra Leone, it's almost to lead Sierra Leone through a Solana transformation. And it just so happens that the first step of that is education. So for me, in the next six months is, of course, focus on the educational part in terms of, to a technical and a non technical audience. But it's now actually, like, how can we actually begin to use this technology to solve, like, real life problems we have in Sierra Leone? So I'm kind of, like, looking to see how we can enter, like, payments, remittances, and also like, growing the blockchain community in Sierra Leone, because, again, I'm a big believer of the use cases that the technology has in emerging markets and specifically in Sierra Leone. So someone's just, like, bringing the awareness to say, this technology is not something that's alien.
00:27:53.198 - 00:27:56.030, Speaker B: It's actually something that can actually help us.
00:27:56.142 - 00:27:57.354, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah.
00:27:58.214 - 00:28:38.570, Speaker C: In fact, I think two months ago, we have marked so me as a first year anniversary. Obviously, we have empowered over a thousand developers already. We're not satisfied. We're ambitious that the next milestone for some is that a lot of developers within our communities, they know how to build someone already. Can we start incubating them? Can we start fostering and building more projects? We have over six projects inspired by our communities already pushed to 1224 40 60. I think that's the question we want to do. Therefore, we have officially acquired a Solana expo next month in Taipei just to empower entire Solana developers.
00:28:38.570 - 00:29:01.896, Speaker C: And then for next January, we have Solana bootcamps. So we have 48 hours hack competitions. We're going to start inviting people from Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, China, since the travel lift has lifted already. So in the May, we have a hacker house happening in Taipei. It's going to be the one of a kind. I encourage you guys to join us. It's not going to be a Solana 101 hacker house.
00:29:01.896 - 00:29:11.296, Speaker C: It's going to be much more advanced. We're going to see much more talented people, much more complex strategy products that are going to be building on Solana happening in Taiwan.
00:29:11.360 - 00:29:12.176, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:29:12.360 - 00:29:45.520, Speaker D: Yeah. I think for us, over the next six months, we've been invested in this idea of building the talent layer for Solana in India. Obviously now we want to build the talent layer for Solana everywhere across the globe and kind of further this kind of circular economy that's starting to take place within our community, where a founder will come up or a developer will have an idea, they'll receive a grant from us, they start to build it out. They can hire other members of the community, they can get people freelance and so on. So really making it everything, every kind of type of talent you would need in one place, so that if you're part of the community, everything you need is right there off the shelf.
00:29:45.672 - 00:29:46.384, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:29:46.544 - 00:30:12.394, Speaker E: We need to figure out our model. We've again been six months and we're figuring things out, and we want to definitely get into mobile development as well. As the saga comes out, there's a ton of mobile developers in New York, so we want to activate them through Empire Dao and start red pilling, onboarding more developers from FAang and other parts of the world. And that's kind of like our mandate. The next bet is just continue to build the developer community on Web three and on Solana.
00:30:12.814 - 00:30:43.208, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah, tldr like, communities are extremely important in this space. Like, no foundation, no l one, no labs organization can actually do what the community can do for you. So if you see them form up around you, like throw your weight behind them and support them, you don't necessarily do it. We don't need to do everything ourselves. So these are prime examples of that. They just take it, they go with it, and then next thing you know, you look six months later and you're like, holy shit, they're all over the world.
00:30:43.208 - 00:30:48.904, Speaker A: And that's time. So thank you guys. Thanking everybody for joining us. Thanks.
