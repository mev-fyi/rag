00:00:13.000 - 00:00:54.634, Speaker A: All right, testing, testing. I'll apologize if my voice cracks awkwardly. My voice has gone through a lot of strain these last few days, as I'm sure it's the same case for many of you. I think Kanan confused the venues, and so he'll hopefully join us shortly, but we'll get kicked off without him. I think I wanted to open this. Before we get into the nitty gritty of building the metaverse and the infrastructure it takes, let's just set the stage with a fun little trick question in three sentences or less. How would you define the metaverse? And I think that's for each of you.
00:00:57.294 - 00:01:42.214, Speaker B: Well, can you hear me? Okay, so, metaverse is the space you interact that is not your immediate surrounding for me. So, from the moment you wake up to the time you sleep, I interact with spaces that are not immediately physical to me, like Twitter, for example, or slack, for example. I live in a virtual world for the most part. That, in my definition, is a metaverse. And slowly but surely, we are moving. The ratio between how much we spend in real life versus the virtual life is widening and towards the virtual life. So we are already in metaverse in some definition.
00:01:44.614 - 00:02:10.376, Speaker C: I think the metaverse we've all experienced over the last two years, all the time we've spent online, all the time many of us are in a room with people for the first time. We've been having all of our experiences through new profile pictures, new ways of expression in many different platforms and places, and that's only going to grow from here. But now we've all at least had a taste of it. That, to me, is still the metaverse.
00:02:10.550 - 00:02:16.624, Speaker D: For me, it's a collection of ownerless, decentralized virtual spaces.
00:02:18.604 - 00:02:21.700, Speaker A: Nice. Sebastian was the only one who kept it under three sentences.
00:02:21.852 - 00:02:22.332, Speaker B: Congrats.
00:02:22.388 - 00:02:22.892, Speaker C: That was tight.
00:02:22.948 - 00:02:23.812, Speaker B: That was tight.
00:02:23.988 - 00:02:34.784, Speaker C: Yeah. We may actually be in the metaverse right now. I'm expecting velociraptors to come flying through this glass and eat us all. So it's kind of looking like jurassic world out there.
00:02:35.484 - 00:02:58.934, Speaker A: Yeah, the venue is great. I agree. All right, so let's get into it. So, the one way I think about this is that there's infrastructure that needs to get built to enable the metaverse. That's for builders. And then there's a set of infrastructure that needs to get built to make it accessible to users, to experience it. And so let's start with the builder's angle first.
00:02:58.934 - 00:03:10.294, Speaker A: So I guess I'll open the question to Sebastian and Greg. What are the key pieces of infrastructure you guys think need to get built out for builders to create.
00:03:14.234 - 00:03:59.684, Speaker B: So again, if you look at builders building metaverse, there are two pieces. There's the actual building piece, and making that piece, what you built available to your users. The hosting piece. From a hosting standpoint, we need different layers that you are used to today, which is discovery processing, storage at a higher level, and discovery I would classify as DNS and blockchain based discovery systems. And processing would be compute, something like a cache network, or live peer, or different specialized compute networks. And then you have storage, which is rv event, Skynet and Filecoin, and different storage providers offering different features. Right.
00:03:59.684 - 00:05:14.778, Speaker B: So what we, and what we need, that's lack, that doesn't exist to build a metaverse is at a higher level. I think today, the risk of metaverse increasingly becoming centralized or controlled by a single party exists, right? So the question we need to ask ourselves is, do we want the metaverse controlled by Facebook, which looks like they are charging full speed ahead, or do we want the metaverse to be controlled by ourselves? Owned by ourselves? So if you look at the infrastructure where we have sovereignty over this new universe, where we are going to spend most of our lives in, that is still very early stages. And I think we have different pieces that can function individually. Just starting to see some sort of a product market fit for these individual pieces. But there is still a lack of cohesive interoperability and better user experience from an access standpoint, even for builders, that's lacking. And a lot of us in this panel right here, we are working together to solve that problem in different ways. And if we're going to solve the problem, it's when.
00:05:14.778 - 00:05:23.614, Speaker B: And once we solve the problem, it's just going to be exponential adoption for the decentralized version of the infrastructure for metaverse.
00:05:24.154 - 00:06:00.104, Speaker D: Yeah, I also agree with that. I think that you need, there's some components there, but you need to have compulsability, you need to have interoperability for all of this to actually work together well. And all of these, in my view at least, should be decentralized, because the last thing that you want in a metaverse as someone just changing the terms of conditions and all of a sudden, whatever space you had is just gone. So it really should have a focus on censorship, resistance, and just making sure that not one single party can decide of the fate of the metaverse.
00:06:02.044 - 00:06:30.998, Speaker A: Makes a ton of sense. And we'll come back to a little bit of the debate on how meta and a centralized metaverse could play versus the decentralized one. But I want to first close off on the other angle here, which is from a consumer's perspective, as someone who's experiencing the metaverse, what do they need in order? Like, what do we need to build in order for that to happen? And so I think, Matt, you're well positioned to answer this one.
00:06:31.086 - 00:07:52.424, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. Well, when we look at Olaplex and our kind of focus on the indie creator, and we see indie creators everywhere in real life all of the time, every cafe we walk by, we'll see writers and artists, musicians. These folks do not have access to the metaverse. They don't really have access to the decentralized world. So with Olaplex, what we're trying to look at is how do we create all of the tools that people need to bring humanity to the blockchain? All of the unique interactions that come from finding friends, building a community, being able to actually successfully bring a project to life that may require all of the amazing technology that these guys know how to build and then still need to be able to connect with people to make that happen. So it's going to be everything from being able to navigate into crypto for the first time, both for the collector or the buyer of NFT or art in this metaverse and for the creators. So I think what we're really focused on is how do we bring those people with no experience at all, right, into the same experience we're all having today?
00:07:54.324 - 00:08:38.084, Speaker A: Makes a ton of sense. So when we think about now, let's go back to sort of centralized versus decentralized systems and infrastructure. I think, you know, there's a couple of key factors, it seems like, that are worth considering. And I'd love to get, you know, this panel's thoughts on where we are today with these key factors. And I think the three that come to mind for me are cost, scalability, and security. And so I'm curious, I guess maybe we can start with Greg on the compute side. You know, if we had to compare decentralized options for compute today versus centralized options today across those three criteria, where are we? And in the future, where do you think we are if that's substantially different from today?
00:08:38.904 - 00:09:25.362, Speaker B: Great. So I think I would classify infrastructure as three separate pillars. You have cost, you have, you know, capabilities, and then you have, I would say, productivity, right? How quickly can you use a piece of infrastructure? Right? So if you look at decentralized networks like Akash, from a cost standpoint, Akash costs anywhere one fifth to one third of what you would. What Amazon would cost. Right. And the reason for that is because compute power comes from a disparate sources in an open market and acquired using a reverse auction mechanism where the user sets the price. Right.
00:09:25.362 - 00:09:50.916, Speaker B: So it's a fairly price, market driven price point that turns out there's ubiquitous amount of compute and that drives cost, something like Arviv. Cost is not necessarily a. Sorry, I'll let Sebastian talk to it. But I'm really excited about rv because we. I love the product and whatnot for them. It's not necessarily a cost driven, but more necessity capability driven, which is the permanence. Right.
00:09:50.916 - 00:10:16.062, Speaker B: Which is very important. But there are other sort of like networks that are cost driven. Like SIA is very competitive when compared to s three. The beautiful thing is we have this amazing set of available options that are not controlled by a single company, but rather by a decentralized network. And when it comes to productivity, I don't think we're quite there yet. Right. So it's still, a lot of the tools are still very hard to use.
00:10:16.062 - 00:10:53.832, Speaker B: A big reason is just onboarding a user, right. So getting access to the tokens. And it's not that we can't settle tokens online, it's just the regulatory frameworks are arcane, designed in hundreds of years ago or 100 years ago that prevents us to even, you know, make our software available to users. Right. But that said, being an open system, being a permissionless system, you have these amazing tools that are coming up around these ecosystems. Like Arviv has a great tool called Argo, I believe, or r drive. And Akash has tools like akashlytics.
00:10:53.832 - 00:11:17.870, Speaker B: And you have four or five different tools that onboard use this in different ways. And it's only time that I'll, you know, be the decisive factor and you'll slowly start seeing higher productivity. And people are already seeing higher productivity gains once you're in the. Once you're in crypto. Right. It's just that crossing over from the web two to web3 is still challenging. Right.
00:11:17.870 - 00:11:34.334, Speaker B: So I think with cost, we're kind of there, with capabilities. We're getting there. And certain networks are very specialized in offering certain capabilities that are not possible in the centralized web today. And productivity, we're getting there. And we're getting there very, very fast.
00:11:35.434 - 00:11:53.338, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. So I guess the one thing I'd want to dig into a little bit is how do you think about security? Because the concern with open systems is always that there's a wide attack vector space. And so just a little bit of how you think about that would be pretty valuable, I think.
00:11:53.506 - 00:12:42.928, Speaker B: Well, so it depends on the protocol. I mean, multiple levels of security. I would argue being an open system is a lot more secure than a closed system, because open systems are publicly audited, the source code is publicly audited, and most software you use today is open source, at least, at least white label does closed source. So we already live in an open system. I would say 90% of the web is still run on Apache web server. So security, when it comes to cache, the security guarantees are probably the same, or if not better than what you would get in a traditional cloud. And because it's an open system, you have higher guarantees when it comes to reliability, because any configuration change has to go through a public setting.
00:12:42.928 - 00:12:47.164, Speaker B: So I would argue it's a lot more secure than a traditional cloud.
00:12:48.504 - 00:13:01.844, Speaker A: Awesome. And Sebastian, I guess turning over the question to you, kind of along those same dimensions of cost and scalability or capability, I guess, is a good way of putting it. And then security, how do you guys think about the data storage element of this?
00:13:01.964 - 00:13:41.444, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. I think that the way that we see this data storage is crucial. If you're storing nfts, or if you're storing your metaverse somewhere because you want it to be available constantly, you want to make sure that it's not going to go down, that people's nfts are not just simply going to disappear after all. These can be worth a lot of money. And so we think that the cost is not necessarily such a big factor. I mean, it's more the security that you actually want, making sure that things are still available to you. So cost is minimal in that equation.
00:13:41.444 - 00:13:45.804, Speaker D: I think that is by far the most important thing.
00:13:47.504 - 00:13:55.712, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. That makes a ton of sense. I guess Kanan was able to join us finally. Kanan, glad you could make it.
00:13:55.888 - 00:13:56.672, Speaker E: Thanks.
00:13:56.848 - 00:14:00.680, Speaker A: This is actually. Does the mic work?
00:14:00.872 - 00:14:01.644, Speaker E: Yo.
00:14:02.984 - 00:14:24.372, Speaker A: All right, that's proof. This is a question I asked Matt earlier, but I think it'd be good to get your perspective on this as well, is I think when you think about building the metaverse and the infrastructure, there's stuff that you need to build for the people who are going to build it, and then there's a piece of it, which is, how do you make the experience for the consumer who wants to experience the metaverse?
00:14:24.468 - 00:14:24.780, Speaker E: Easy.
00:14:24.812 - 00:14:36.132, Speaker A: And so I figured, given your perspective at Stardust and trying to build web, three games, what do you think we need to bring hundreds of millions of people into this world? Sure.
00:14:36.188 - 00:15:31.824, Speaker E: Thank you. I think overall, we need something more managed than the default login with Phantom or login with metamask. I think that will always appeal to a certain set of users, and those users should always be able to off board effectively into the mode of security that they actually want to use to play or interact with the ecosystem. I think on a broader scale, you see a lot of defi versus c five, you know, c five being a coinbase or an FTX, where that account is managed for you in an omnibus wallet, so that actions aren't rapidly represented. On Jane, that's great from a user experience, but from a composability problem, it actually fragments liquidity. And so, you know, it's better, but you're still no farther along than where you started. It's just a bunch of ecosystems that are connected through a central layer, but the still fragment of liquidity leads to problematic issues when trying to build composable apps.
00:15:31.824 - 00:16:21.770, Speaker E: The route we take, and I think we'll catch on more, is more a managed defi layer where we're actually managing everybody's wallet internally as a coinbase or an FTX would. But instead of putting them all in a single wallet and making all the transactions in a database, we actually reflect every single state transition onto the chain itself. And that allows players in game, through an NPC, to, for example, interact with something like sushiswap on chain. And it's a very different methodology. And so I think to go back to your question twofold. Number one, user experience from a more managed layer is a must have. But then also exposing that managed layer so that there is still the composability and security guarantee we have of blockchain, and not just throwing that out the window because we say it's ease of.
00:16:21.802 - 00:16:46.934, Speaker A: Use, totally makes a ton of sense. I mean, I can say personally, people like my girlfriend, who aren't really crypto native, it stresses them out, having to think about private keys and managing their own wallet. So it makes a ton of sense. What do you think, Kanan, are the challenges in actually making that layer a reality? Is it a technical challenge? Is it a regulatory one?
00:16:49.514 - 00:17:10.312, Speaker E: Interesting question. I think if you look at the target customer base of many of the on chain apps, the target profile of one of their users to do, for example, in the NFT space, a drop or a sale or appeal to on chain users, is actually not a user that wants a managed experience, right. They want to appeal to people who.
00:17:10.448 - 00:17:11.616, Speaker A: Have a lot of soul or have.
00:17:11.640 - 00:17:57.276, Speaker E: A lot of ethereum or a lot of bitcoin or something like that. And that far and wide is not and is frankly kind of looser with their money, is not necessarily the type of person that comes from a web two background that would then onboard with a credit card into web3. And we see a lot of that kind of in user direction. And so I think it's, first of all, a mindset change, right. As developers see more and more profitable avenues to target the millions of users who may not have phantom in Metamask. Currently. That's one of the biggest challenges we see when we speak to developers is not, it's not that they won't ever use us or it's just like for right now, their target customer is not actually somebody who wants to log in with Google, but rather their target customer is a phantom user.
00:17:57.300 - 00:18:27.488, Speaker A: Today makes sense. Yeah, you got to know your customer. Okay, so I want to kind of keep in this thread of people who will experience the metaverse versus strictly the builders, but for you, Matt, because you've talked to a lot of artists and people who are not necessarily crypto people, but want to create in this world, what are the concerns that they have? Like, what do we need to build to alleviate their reservations?
00:18:27.616 - 00:19:07.092, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think Kanan started on this topic. So for, you know, indie artists or, you know, first time collectors of digital art who may be buying, you know, IRL art or something like this, you know, they're not coming from a financial transaction, right? They're trying to be entertained. They're trying to experience beauty. They're trying to have a shared experience with a community and be part of that self expression. And so for them, you know, the wallet and the financialization of art is actually very foreign. It's kind of the opposite of creative. And so removing all of those layers is critical.
00:19:07.092 - 00:19:48.864, Speaker C: I think that on the back end of that, what's really exciting is you're now onboarding hundreds of thousands and millions of people who are coming to decentralized web to interoperable economies because they want to have an experience of beauty or an experience of joy or entertainment. And so you're now converting just a whole new set of users. And so it's got to be completely seamless. It's not a, you know, I don't pull out my credit card before I start thinking about buying art. I want to be immersed in that experience. I want to be part of a community. So it's basically being able to deliver as much of that before you come to them with, show me your money.
00:19:50.164 - 00:20:13.086, Speaker A: Totally. It makes sense. Yeah. Experience first, you know, money later, okay, I guess switching tack a little bit. And I guess this is also probably for Sebastian and Greg initially. You know, obviously the audience here for the most part, and us here on the panel, like, we're a biased sample. We're very bullish on the future of what the metaverse can be and web3 can be.
00:20:13.086 - 00:20:28.034, Speaker A: But, you know, what worries you about the, like, what are the riskiest things that we have to solve, whether, you know, individually or as a community to make this dream a reality? Right. Like, or if we were to fail, what do you think those failure points could be?
00:20:29.094 - 00:20:30.194, Speaker B: I'm in trouble.
00:20:30.534 - 00:20:41.434, Speaker A: Oh, there's a question. I guess, to try to rephrase it more succinctly, what are the biggest risks to us making this metaverse future a possibility?
00:20:42.414 - 00:20:44.166, Speaker C: Points of failure. Potential points.
00:20:44.230 - 00:21:35.204, Speaker B: Oh, potential points of failure is centralized infrastructure, right? Like, so we all know how many times Amazon went down. We all know every time when you do a crypto punk transaction, you got to do a secondary transaction, right? Like actually store this somewhere that is controlled by a, by someone that's not tied to your wallet, right? So there is this, you know, I mean, there are essentially two transactions every time you do anything viable that's hosted on a web, too. So. Well, the one way to alleviate the risk is to move different critical parts of hosting and processing a certain piece of art off from a centralized infrastructure to a decentralized. You can store in rv, and you can use Akash to process that data.
00:21:40.384 - 00:21:59.864, Speaker A: That makes sense. Actually, the question I intended and phrased, perhaps poorly, maybe, Sebastian, you can try to take a stab at this is like, what are the biggest challenges that we need to resolve to make all of this technology ready for a billion people? Or are we just there yet and they haven't realized?
00:22:00.564 - 00:23:01.374, Speaker D: I wouldn't necessarily focus on the sort of infrastructure technology challenges. I think that there is a, I mean, just by looking, by judging at the audience, you see the energy that is in this space and, like, how much attention is going into it. So eventually these will be overcome, whatever challenges for onboarding or for platforms to actually build in a decentralized way. I think that one of the biggest risks that we're facing, quite frankly, is just the inertia towards centralized sort of like shortcuts to make this happen. And then eventually, once you launch something in a centralized way with a centralized user experience, probably is going to be relatively difficult to switch, switch out of it completely without sort of harming the user experience to which your users are already accustomed. And so I think that is the thing that worries me and that's the thing that we should probably all be focused on and working on making sure that the infrastructure is robust enough and that we don't get trapped into the sort of like centralized shortcuts way of things.
00:23:01.954 - 00:23:48.434, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. In some ways you can write the code, but you, to change the behavior and overcome the inertia, it's sort of a different challenge. Okay. Makes a ton of sense. All right, so, you know, before we wrap up, the thing we have to discuss is the elephant in the room, which is, you know, how do we think with, you know, the announcement of meta and Facebook at least being the first to dive into, you know, what's likely to be a very centralized metaverse? What do you guys think the future looks like? Is it one in which the decentralized metaverse is a clear winner? Is it one in which they coexist in some way? Or is it one in which, or do we not know yet? Is it too early to say? I guess, Kanan, if you want to take a first stab at that. Cheers.
00:23:49.134 - 00:24:55.686, Speaker E: You know, I think one of the problems with the metaverse, going back to the last question, even this one, is the economic incentives are not aligned to make an open ecosystem. And if you look at the web two, space, just no company in its right mind, frankly, unless it's starting from scratch, would ever give up any of it, any of the hold it has over the ecosystem in order to open it up for other people to extract value from it. Every token or portion of ownership they give you as part of the system is a portion of ownership they don't have. Why would they do that? I mean, I think that's pretty straightforward. And so like, you know, we say wag me or Wagyu or whatever it is, right? But on the other side, it's really like the old school companies have never made money that way, and I don't think we can ever expect them to. And so from a Facebook, I mean, you know, there are many more companies who will come out with very similar setups. It is kind of on us to show that, frankly, for the end developer of the game, it's more profitable in this model.
00:24:55.686 - 00:25:42.474, Speaker E: And if we can't do that, you know, past kind of speculation and token printing aside, it's just not going to ever catch on and someone will own the metaverse. And I think that's a very foreseeable and unfortunate circumstance of the future. And how kind of the crypto space goes up and down, you know, if we're down and someone comes in, it's potential possibility. So it's on us overall to show that we together are stronger than one company that can put ownership of the system before its users. And I think it's on us to also understand that we are giving up some of the overall value in the systems we create to instead make a system that is more beneficial for everybody.
00:25:43.504 - 00:26:41.544, Speaker B: Yeah. To that point, this is not the first time a centralized company tried to put claim to something that should be open and decentralized. If you remember AOL, AOL tried to own the Internet before browser and interoperability came and figured it out, right? There was hundreds of protocols before AOL, but eventually the world came together on any standard set of protocols and all figured out how to interoperate with each other. So history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. So this time around, open protocols have a much better value capture mechanism through tokenization, right? So even though without even focusing on value capture, you can focus on value creation and somehow the capture happens. And I think that creates a set of incentives that are extremely powerful and that's going to reverse a trend much quicker from centralization towards decentralization.
00:26:43.244 - 00:27:46.632, Speaker C: I can maybe take a little bit different view on this. I don't think most of the world is going to get red pilled in any way and join the true open, decentralized metaverse that we think is the best place to be. A lot of folks are going to be very happy having two apps inside of meta or Facebook or whatever it's called, and being able to take their pig avatar and use it in their nights of the roundtable game that they're playing, and they'll think they're in the metaverse. So they will be blue pilled for the rest of their lives. They'll be living in Meta's version of the Metaverse and they'll be quite happy with that. But the opportunity that's here to create interoperable economies and to use some of this new technology to spark a whole new wave of entrepreneurship, of ownership, of founders, whether they're creatives, of making art or music or creating new software tools and owning that and then sharing that with their community, that's undeniable. It's going to be larger than anything we've seen.
00:27:46.632 - 00:27:56.004, Speaker C: I just don't think it completely displaces the vanilla experience of living on whatever Facebook wants to call itself next year or a year after.
00:27:56.874 - 00:28:27.928, Speaker D: Yeah, I sort of agree. I think that's going to be, I mean, it's Facebook after all. Right? It's not a small company by any definition, and they definitely have the money and the people to just, like, throw at this, but it doesn't necessarily always work. I think incentives are the key factor here. So, look, if it has. If the version that we built has consumer integrity, allows people to basically decide, yo, I want it to look like this. I wanted to run my own content policies.
00:28:27.928 - 00:28:47.844, Speaker D: I want to own that myself. And if you also allow people to monetize it in a fair way, distributing the proceeds to the content creators, and also rewarding people for their attention, I think that that is pretty powerful. So, yeah, I think that they're going to coexist, but at least it's my hope that we're going to win.
00:28:50.854 - 00:29:24.470, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay. Yeah, so I guess it does seem like actually, and I'm a little bit surprised by this, like, it's a pretty consistent tone, which is that the race is absolutely on. The winner is not determined. And it's really a combination of, like, the open community coming together and leveraging the incentives that tokens provide to go build this world and make it compelling enough to compete with meta. And so I guess we've got a lot of work to do.
