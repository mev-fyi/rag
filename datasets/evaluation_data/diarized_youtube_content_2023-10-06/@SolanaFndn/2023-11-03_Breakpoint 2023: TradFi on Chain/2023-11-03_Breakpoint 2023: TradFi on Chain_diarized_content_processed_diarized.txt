00:00:01.440 - 00:00:18.794, Speaker A: Good morning, everyone. Here we have Sid, from, who is the founder of Maple Finance, and David, who is the founder of Key Rock as well. Maybe we can start off with quick introductions about yourselves, what you guys are doing right now, and what was your lives before crypto?
00:00:19.894 - 00:00:20.710, Speaker B: You want to start?
00:00:20.822 - 00:00:21.514, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:23.414 - 00:00:44.840, Speaker C: So I'm the CEO and co founder of Maple. So we do institutional lending on chain. We launched about two years ago, and our DNA has always been like debt, capital markets on chain. So my background was banking and finance. So I used to do institutional lending. This was lending to lending companies effectively. And so what we've tried to do with Maple is have a diverse set of offerings.
00:00:44.840 - 00:01:10.574, Speaker C: So we do tokenized t bills effectively. That product we call cash management. And we just launched that back on Solana after a twelve month hiatus. And then we also do real world asset lending. So we do a product that does loans to businesses in the real world where we effectively lend against their tax credits that are due from the government. And then more recently we launched Maple Direct. And so this has been doing loans to funds, but over collateralized.
00:01:10.574 - 00:01:26.464, Speaker C: What we tried to do there was step in, fill the void that was kind of left by some of the CFI companies. So we integrated with custodians. So it's a lot more transparent with all the loans being on chain and all of the assets being held in a custodian. But that's a little bit about us.
00:01:27.004 - 00:01:27.604, Speaker A: Very good.
00:01:27.644 - 00:01:51.808, Speaker B: So I'm David C. So I'm co founder of Key Rock. We are an algorithmic trading company, market maker. We have multiple businesses. I think for today, what is relevant is our activity on chain. So we are power user of DeFi. So we use all of the types of DeFi applications and have a lot of experience going through all of the risks and rewards of interacting with innovation.
00:01:51.808 - 00:01:53.644, Speaker B: I'm so happy to talk about it today.
00:01:54.064 - 00:02:08.884, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool. Maybe we can kick off with the first question about what were some of the biggest surprises that you saw in crypto compared to your tradfi careers and that you think should be definitely improved in the first go.
00:02:10.744 - 00:02:13.280, Speaker B: Maybe I can just go ahead with that one.
00:02:13.312 - 00:02:13.988, Speaker C: Correct.
00:02:14.176 - 00:02:37.212, Speaker B: I mean, I think one of the, it's really improving a lot, but one of the things that was very interesting is there was this misconception in the idea of decentralization and custody being a connected concept. So I don't know if you remember back in the day, there were a lot of companies talking about the fact that if you would have something decentralized, that would mean that it is non custodial.
00:02:37.308 - 00:02:37.652, Speaker A: Correct.
00:02:37.708 - 00:03:10.092, Speaker B: And that the decentralized alternative was the non custodial, therefore, was better than decentralized alternative, which was finance, and decentralized exchanges, which hold custodial, your assets. Now, what is very interesting is that in traditional markets, centralized institutions are non custodial. So somehow kind of like, the whole narrative around that was very strange to begin with, as it kind of, like, didn't fit the picture of the objective. So you had this whole narrative of we need to decentralize the world because we need to take custody away from the exchanges.
00:03:10.228 - 00:03:10.860, Speaker A: Correct.
00:03:11.012 - 00:03:17.764, Speaker B: But in reality, in traditional finance, like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq don't have actually custody, in a sense.
00:03:17.804 - 00:03:18.020, Speaker A: Correct.
00:03:18.052 - 00:03:30.384, Speaker B: So it was actually very funny, and now that's a lot more clear. But it was one of the things that when we came in, it was very, very shocking to see how that was playing out in terms of the narrative in the technology.
00:03:30.964 - 00:04:33.954, Speaker C: Yeah, I think probably on the lending front, I mean, our initial DNA was we were doing under collateralized loans to market makers and high frequency trading firms. And coming in from a banking background, you would always have a lot of security, for example. And it was quite a conservative set of lending there. But the number of viable businesses in the crypto space was so small that everybody was kind of pushed further out the risk curve, I would say, in terms of lending to these companies. But what we've seen over time is that you now have other forms of very well known crypto companies who have strong balance sheets, who can borrow in a secured format. But that was probably the biggest shock I had coming in, was I was used to this very heavy asset backed form of lending. And in crypto lending, it was largely uncollateralized, with the exception of the bitcoin and ETH backed loans, which, again, is very different to the type of lending you'd do in traditional finance.
00:04:33.954 - 00:05:29.056, Speaker C: Banks don't do a ton of lending against gold, for example, or other liquid traded financial assets. What we've seen, though, is, because it's a new space, you actually have to invent solutions here. So bitcoin and ETH backed lending became really huge. You now use tools like on chain monitoring to see how profitable the companies are that you're lending to and make sure that they're going to be able to pay the loans back when you give them to them. But also, it's prompted us to now look outside of crypto and say, okay, well, let's do the type of lending we would want to see on here by bridging to traditional borrowers, whether it's fintech originators, companies that produce goods in the real world. So one of the pools we launched this year is doing tax credit receivables. So those loans would ultimately be going to small businesses like restaurants, shops.
00:05:29.056 - 00:05:46.752, Speaker C: And we take collateral in the form of money that they are due back from the government in the form of tax rebates. But those are now companies outside this kind of correlated sphere of crypto risk. And, you know, they're kind of benefiting from this form of on chain finance.
00:05:46.888 - 00:06:01.068, Speaker A: Got it. And then when you look at the fintech companies, what is usually like the first barrier for them to actually come in and use your solutions? Like, what do you guys pitch to them? Because they're probably used to more regulated environments.
00:06:01.196 - 00:07:17.324, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, regulated as a barrier is a bit of a misnomer, but what they're looking for is how are they getting compensated for coming in and taking the additional risk of doing things on chain in a new industry where there's reputational risk and other kinds of risks. And so how we try and pitch them at the moment is 1st. 1st, let's satisfy their requirements around compliance. So, KYC, knowing where the funds come from, knowing that things are properly documented, but then how do we entice them to put money into a protocol like Maple, which is fixed income and lending, is, we have to offer them something differentiated. So if we're only offering the same thing as like an Aries or an Apollo or a KKR, it's not going to be super attractive to anyone beyond very novel early adopters who see an appeal in novel technology like blockchain. How we get the later adopters and the real family offices, high net worths, funds and foundations and pensions, who allocate the real capital, is we have to offer them something differentiated that they can't get there. That is where I actually find things like BTc ETH.
00:07:17.324 - 00:07:54.544, Speaker C: Collateralized loans are appealing because they can't get them elsewhere, but we can also start to offer them lower fees. So I would say if we can offer them lower asset management fees, our general take rate is about 20% of interest in a typical credit fund that might have been like 30, 35%, and then more liquidity so they can get their funds back sooner than a three to five year lockup. But they're looking, they're not looking at, you know, pie in the sky ideas about the technology. They're looking at nuts and bolts. Is it cheaper, is it more liquid? And does it deliver them a better, you know, better bottom line at the end of the day.
00:07:54.704 - 00:08:18.792, Speaker A: Got it. Understood. Which would, I guess bring me to my next question. Right. Since we kind of spoke about the compliance and KYC part, that is. So I guess with regards to a more high level overview, definitely keen to learn your opinions on how, what are like the key building blocks that you think are kind of required and are very important, but not there. And are you, if there are any.
00:08:18.792 - 00:08:21.736, Speaker A: Are you aware of any development happening in this space for this?
00:08:21.880 - 00:08:23.488, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, maybe I'll take that one.
00:08:23.536 - 00:08:24.560, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, go for it.
00:08:24.712 - 00:08:50.780, Speaker B: Just before I go on that, going back to what you're saying, back in the old days when there was uncollectoralized lending, we received a lot of uncollateralized lending. We never defaulted on anything, just putting it out there. We treated every loan as if it was our money, which I think for us was a shock when we realized that other people were not treating with respect the fact that somebody trusted you in that way. Unfortunately, the market has changed. I mean, unfortunately for companies like us.
00:08:50.812 - 00:08:51.236, Speaker C: Correct.
00:08:51.340 - 00:10:05.706, Speaker B: But it is healthy and we embrace it and we think it's a good path moving forward, but it's also going to come with a lot of new opportunities throughout. Concepts like the tokenization of debt, which were going to enable high leverage and say, uncollateralized lending or capital acquisition in a form in the future. So going back to your question, I mean, the way that we look at it is that first of all, we need to have a split of what it is the blockchain technology as a settlement layer, and what it is the blockchain technology as, let's say financial primitive layer, which is what we call DeFi, and everything that is executable trading, when you divide it in two, we actually believe that the stages of maturity of these two elements are completely different. While the settlement layer blockchain is already, in our point of view, rather mature for institutions, we can trade OTC and then settle on chain that is used in the technology. And we believe that today already, institutions are at the point that they're comfortable with that. As a matter of fact, you see them using settlement networks like fire blocks or copper or institutional wallets and of the likes. And that settlement layer is using the technology.
00:10:05.706 - 00:10:52.072, Speaker B: Correct. Now, the problem is that when you go the next level, you say, okay, on top of having my technology replacing the settlement layer of traditional finance, now I want to replace the interaction and financial primitives that are incorporated there. We have a barrier to entry for institutions, and the barrier to entry would be, I would say, predominantly a matter of trust. Like we are in a stage in the industry where Dapps, or financial infrastructure in DeFi, is similar to the early stage of apps when they came out into these Android phones and they were clunky and they could break and people therefore wouldn't trust them. Correct. So what we're waiting for is somehow the Apple store phenomenon. Correct.
00:10:52.072 - 00:11:34.510, Speaker B: Where you have an ecosystem that gets created that is approved for quality to the point that is an afterthought, like in the way that you download an app today in your iPhone and you know that the code is going to be good, you're not going to, it's not going to default on you. That layer is definitely missing. And for institutional adoption to come in and touch it, they're going to have to do that. Because the reality of it is that we test a lot of these protocols, and I can tell you the amount of protocols that fail on us is alarming. There are a lot of them that they do. They have oracle problems or reentrance attacks, collateral that gets defaulted. And in our case, we know how to handle that because that's our job.
00:11:34.510 - 00:11:46.712, Speaker B: And we know how to manage the risk and deploy amounts that are small enough when you don't have certain, certain information. But an institution that just wants to get a tokenized TbL, they don't want to do that.
00:11:46.888 - 00:11:47.200, Speaker A: Correct.
00:11:47.232 - 00:12:06.514, Speaker B: They just want to come in, trust the system and say, boom. And that's why today, the tokenized t bill, like you guys are doing, is absolutely ready for institutional adoption as an OTC with on chain settlement. But even though companies like Ondo are doing it fully on chain, there is that extra barrier of trust in the ecosystem network we need to be built.
00:12:07.374 - 00:12:27.878, Speaker C: Do you think? It's an interesting point, because do you think that that relies on some degree of centralization, like as in to get that trust, they kind of need to say, point and say, here's the brand that did this and we trust in that brand, or can they trust in the decentralized infrastructure, blockchain and then applications being built on top of it?
00:12:28.006 - 00:13:09.454, Speaker B: I think it's going to be both. You already can see today. Okay, we have like companies that are doing auditing. The reality of it is that your track record is not 100% correct, so they don't manage to serve that function. But the ecosystems that are built on top of the blockchain, the blockchain or the layer one foundation can serve as that stamp of quality in first instance. But then you also have the tech statistically speaking, your application is going to fail less if the underlying technology forces you to build in certain ways. So going back to the analogy of the Apple Store, the programming language that is used for apps in Apple, it's a lot more restrictive than Android.
00:13:09.454 - 00:13:25.790, Speaker B: Correct. Which makes them maybe not have as much functionality, but they don't fail. Same here. Correct. And if you look at the programming languages that are using chains like Solana. Correct. With rost, we are rost based companies as well.
00:13:25.790 - 00:14:07.094, Speaker B: The language itself enforces a lot of checks and balances that are going to make your dapps more stable. So already, just from the get go, the probability of failure on a rost engineer application is going to be less than on an EVM based system. Correct. And that's why you also see now the creation of EVM compatible ROS based chains or languages for deployment of smart contracts. So the whole technology needs to emerge to a point where as the developer builds the DApp, it's forced by the technology to fall under certain categories so that the mistakes don't happen and safety is kept. But as well, there needs to be some central party that can say, okay, we check this and it is approved.
00:14:07.134 - 00:14:07.350, Speaker C: Correct.
00:14:07.382 - 00:14:33.284, Speaker B: Like a little bit like Star Apple store phenomenon. I do believe that that's going to be a key fundamental. Correct. At the end of the day, no matter if you have AAA applications on Ethereum, you have Aave and you have Chainlink and so on, which are great. But a small startup that is creating an innovation has such a huge barrier because outside of the native people, everybody else is going to default, mistrust them because they are a smart contract. That's a big problem.
00:14:33.624 - 00:15:01.564, Speaker A: Makes sense. And in this equation, what do you also think about privacy? Because we've also been trying to get some of our products involved on chain, but then due to regulatory requirements, then it should be like a nice set of privacy infrastructure. But so far we have not been able to see any, I guess, working privacy solution in the market so far. But we'll be glad to hear your thoughts on what are some of the key developments in that area.
00:15:03.064 - 00:16:11.892, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, privacy is an interesting one that kind of comes up as this catch all for institutions. We haven't actually met an institution yet who wouldn't do a transaction purely because they're worried about it being broadcast on chain. Typically they kind of default to other things, like overall concern about a smart contract hack or just the fact that they can already do it bilaterally directly, like in the case of lending, they just say, well, we could just lend directly to these folks instead of going through a protocol. I've seen the conversation around privacy drive a lot of investment this year in whether it's l two s that are privacy focused, or wrapping tools where you wrap an asset or a token in a privacy enabled layer so that it can be, you know, so it can be transferred without, you know, broadcasting. That was you who was doing it. But I think for that to really take off, you probably need just more opportunities or more attractive opportunities on chain like. We were working on a pilot program where you would have had a privacy wrapped asset that could have been loaned out between two very large institutions.
00:16:11.892 - 00:16:41.274, Speaker C: So a large bank that was doing stuff on chain and a market making firm, but in the end, it just kind of stole because the trading opportunities weren't that great. So I think you'll see adoption of privacy enabled technology as overall trends trading volumes pick up. But I do think it's not something to kind of dismiss as large institutions will just get past it. I think it will still be important for them. Key Rock probably faces the same thing.
00:16:41.654 - 00:17:42.358, Speaker B: I think that when you look at privacy, it's also important to distinguish what are you talking about when you say privacy? Because there are different elements of privacy. You could again, almost divide these into two categories. You can have privacy of knowledge about what you do, which is kind of like on chain privacy in the sense like, you cannot just go and read my transaction and know that I bought in the past certain assets, which is a type of privacy that I also personally don't see too much demand for at this stage. And then you have privacy of execution, which is at the moment that you're doing an action. You want that action to be unknown just for the period of time while you do it, because of your fear that that information gives an advantage to somebody else to game you give you a worse price. And if you look in, again, in traditional finance, you have all of these systems of what they call dark pools. But the dark pool doesn't mean that you don't at the end, do KYC, or that you are not as a party understood in the network.
00:17:42.358 - 00:18:15.694, Speaker B: It just means that you are hiding your buying intent. You see, and those are two separate things. We can definitely have a chain that is fully transparent where you can still track the wallets of who did what, because they don't mind, but they want to hide their activity at the moment, correct? This is if you want. If you want to buy a million dollars of bitcoin, most probably you're not going to care about either of the two, you're like, okay, whatever. But if, let's say I want to go to the market today, I want to buy, I want to take a $5 million position on my maple. And the asset is not super liquid, correct?
00:18:16.114 - 00:18:16.658, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:16.746 - 00:18:34.610, Speaker B: So if I just go and do that, I'm afraid that as soon as people see that I'm starting to accumulate this position, they're gonna react to me and they. And basically they're gonna front run me into the trade, buy it, making my entry position more expensive. So that layer of privacy, that need of privacy is purely financial.
00:18:34.802 - 00:18:35.458, Speaker A: Correct.
00:18:35.586 - 00:18:38.034, Speaker B: And I think for that, they would start to be demand.
00:18:40.214 - 00:18:48.198, Speaker C: Do you think the demand will pick up as the market becomes more efficient? Because theoretically, there's less alpha to kind of go around. So you need to preserve it with privacy.
00:18:48.246 - 00:18:56.062, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I mean, I think a lot of early stage funds, when they were doing these trades, they didn't even care about privacy. Because they didn't feel that it was affecting them whatsoever.
00:18:56.118 - 00:18:56.470, Speaker A: Correct.
00:18:56.542 - 00:19:55.838, Speaker B: Because their need is not to be secretive. Their need is just to maximize profits, which is a different privacy need that the other type of privacy, which is encryption of information, where they could also be blockchains that are fully encrypted. You can have a smart contract based monero model where everything is encrypted and then the activity has a different use. But I think majority of institutions, as alpha becomes harder, are going to start wondering, is my alpha affected? Because somebody sees what I do? You see that on chain already? Correct, on chain. Because you can take advantage of mev. Today we are in a situation where basically, if you don't use flashbots to broadcast your traits on ETH mainnet, you would most probably be taken advantage of, which basically means acquiring privacy on the execution. And that's already the case today on chain execution, on order books, it's less noticeable, so people care less, but it will get to the point that it becomes more and more important, I guess probably not for bitcoin, Ethereum.
00:19:55.838 - 00:20:04.382, Speaker B: Again, if I want to buy $5 million of Maple token, I think I would like to announce that after I acquire the position, not as I do.
00:20:04.398 - 00:20:10.454, Speaker C: It, maybe for bitcoin, if you're Michael Saylor, buying exactly 200 million or a billion.
00:20:10.614 - 00:20:44.586, Speaker A: Yeah. And since we're on the topic of privacy, maybe, and since we're in Europe, can we go to the privacy regulations here? Right. So for people or entrepreneurs that are building solutions, that are catered to institutions that do prefer privacy or the other way around, or in general, just normal smart contracts. Right. What do you think about the potential regulatory situation here in Europe? Because obviously, based on the regulations, it kind of seems like blockchain itself is not possible in Europe.
00:20:44.650 - 00:20:44.898, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:44.946 - 00:21:03.694, Speaker A: Because you have to delete the data after seven days. I think so. Would be curious to hear your thoughts on, like, what are you seeing in terms of the developments in the parliaments of different countries for blockchain? And what should entrepreneurs basically be doing if, you know, things don't work out?
00:21:04.954 - 00:21:06.654, Speaker B: You want to take it?
00:21:06.994 - 00:22:11.574, Speaker C: Yeah, I can start there. I mean, the things, things like GDPR no doubt make it harder and costlier to build products as an entrepreneur. But I think entrepreneurs should start backwards from trying to build the best product and then worry about fitting it into regulation, because ultimately, regulation will not be static over a multi decade period. And at the end of the day, there is at least some degree of competition on the regulatory front where a jurisdiction doesn't want to kind of price itself out of attracting innovators by making it impossible to work and to build in a region. So I think off the back of that, entrepreneurs should try and build first and foremost the best product that kind of serves their customers within spitting distance of regulation, and then look at how they need to kind of optimize it from there. But potentially go potentially look at offshore jurisdictions if that's the case. That is one of the advantages of building in crypto is you have a truly global product.
00:22:11.574 - 00:23:15.814, Speaker C: But I think what we've seen over the course of 2022 was that certain jurisdictions, Europe, came out of the gate fairly fast with Mica, then Singapore and Hong Kong have followed suit. The US is still kind of lagging behind, but you have a degree of competition between regulatory regimes where they do want to at least attract innovators, or at least they say they do. And so it gives you options where you can keep the integrity of your product and just move to a jurisdiction which is kind of more favorable for you. The one thing I worry about with Europe is that they kind of jump the gun too quickly in terms of putting in place a firm set of rules that are going to ultimately make it a little bit too difficult to operate here. We kind of saw that with the UK rules around promotion of crypto. So everyone can agree that it's a good idea that grandmas and grandpas shouldn't be sold scammy crypto products or have them advertised to them. But in putting in place that rule and saying, you need to be registered to advertise crypto products.
00:23:15.814 - 00:24:25.708, Speaker C: In the UK, as a startup, we have a newsletter? Is that newsletter advertising to our clients if they're in the UK? So we had to block UK recipients for a couple of months of just a newsletter about what's going on with us, because we're worried about that being construed as marketing crypto products without registration. And so I think every regulation has a corresponding equal and opposite effect where it kind of dilutes something that you actually want to preserve. Regulators should be really conscious of that, and to some extent, you should kind of. There's this old saying with Dwight Eisenhower where when he was president of this college campus, they were looking at where to pave footpaths. And he said, instead of setting out where the footpaths should go, let's just look at where people walk and then pave over that, because that's ultimately going to be most useful. And I think regulators should kind of take that approach, like, see what people are actually doing and then create useful rules around that, that kind of set some guardrails, rather than trying to be overly prescriptive in the activity that you want to see, try and regulate for the results rather than the activity itself.
00:24:25.876 - 00:25:29.392, Speaker B: Makes sense, maybe just to add on that, I agree actually pretty much with the idea from a technology point of view. I also think that it is not to underestimate the fact that blockchains can adapt to regulatory environment very fast. Like, I don't actually think it's a hurdle whatsoever. I think that whatever information compliance comes in, or like reporting standards comes in, the ingenuity and innovation of this industry can deal with it very fast. As a matter of fact, you can already see today protocols that are built on top of Ethereum to enable these regulatory frameworks. Companies like Valvet, where you, you would have like an on chain KYC that then is transferable to multiple applications that would incorporate that technology. Or you have now order books and on chain matching engine systems that already build from the ground up with the understanding of what are the requirements of the singaporean regulator or the Hong Kong regulator that has given more clarity in terms of exchanges.
00:25:29.392 - 00:26:06.432, Speaker B: And they're coming up really quick. I mean, we've already seen the prototypes of these on, let's say, regulatory ready matching engines on chain already last month. They already exist. From a technology point of view, it goes really fast. The regulator gives clarity on what is an MTA and how should an exchange run and people just build around it super quick. So I'm not too worried in terms of technology being able to keep up with what's going on. Then you have the additional layers, the additional idea, which is that you can also build a layer one that is regulatory ready, so that everything that is built on top acquires those characteristics.
00:26:06.432 - 00:26:21.008, Speaker B: For example, you could have a layer one where the native wallet of the system has incorporated KYC on it. And then basically when you create your wallet, you have to do KYC, but you cannot use the chain. That technology already exists. The problem is that nobody wants to use it.
00:26:21.096 - 00:26:31.344, Speaker C: Yeah, it also fragments the market, because if you have a different requirement between the US and Europe, then do you need necessarily a different layer one between the US and Europe?
00:26:31.884 - 00:27:00.366, Speaker B: The layer 1 may be capable to get different profiles and different regulatory characteristics, but the problem is not that the technology doesn't exist. People really don't use it. You can kyc yourself on chain today, but you probably don't do it. And people don't do it just because they don't want to be KYC on chain. But the technology is there, and as soon as the regulatory framework really comes in to enforce it, the technology will just flourish. But is there already a lot of.
00:27:00.390 - 00:27:48.884, Speaker C: Defi actually operates largely in compliance with the key legal requirements on Maple? We KyC all the new lenders who come in. So we always know the source of funds. And we have to do that because institutions who use the platform, if they're depositing $5 million, they want to make sure that they're in a pool with clean money. And so I think these things don't require fully re engineering the l one or a significant engineering lift. It's just using different business practices. But it's interesting because I think it does still hold back a lot of institutional adoption because they have this misperception perception that KYC can't be done on a blockchain, but it can. It's just how you operate your business.
00:27:48.884 - 00:28:26.022, Speaker C: Also, it was a big trend last year that we saw you kind of had this idea of permission defi and permissionless deFi. And permissionless Defi is easier to prototype products, easier to attract customers, but it tends to be more retail focused at this stage. And permission Defi is where the institutions are playing. You saw early attempts at this, like Aaves Arc. We started launching permission pools in late 2021, and ultimately our business has shifted entirely away from anything permissionless towards the permission pools, because the customer set that we wanted to attract is more institutional.
00:28:26.198 - 00:28:58.710, Speaker A: Got it. Understood. And then would also be definitely keen to hear your experiences on dealing with, I guess, non cryptonative regulated fraudfis. Like, what are they actually looking for to be participating in the ecosystem, right. That's like a pretty big question that's on everyone's mind. And you obviously have Blackrock coming on with the ETF stuff, but I guess that does not really benefit the on chain ecosystems as much as they should. I mean, obviously the price increases, but you know, it's not pretty much same.
00:28:58.710 - 00:29:06.834, Speaker A: But then if they are, maybe they want to contribute on chain to Solana, ethereum or whatever. Like what are they actually looking for in your interactions with them?
00:29:07.894 - 00:30:18.216, Speaker C: The large treadfight institutions, what are they looking for? I think ultimately it's kind of profit motif based. Like if we look at where when there was the most interest, it was 2021 and early 2022, then as we progressed a little long 2022, the interest waned. And that's because bit nobody at those large institutions can secure a promotion internally or kudos internally by launching a project that's not going to get any traction on the blockchain. It's also going to expose them to reputational risk. I think as we see this price action that's happening at the moment, it's actually quite positive for institutions to re up these projects, unmossed them, and start looking at doing things on chain, but the motivation will be profit for them. And so you need to see more retail trading volume, more stable coin market cap for them to pursue projects like this. And as somebody who will in future be competing with them as key rock will be, I actually don't want to kind of hasten their return too much.
00:30:18.216 - 00:31:29.884, Speaker C: Like it's good to see interest in the space. But if we think about how will we as crypto native companies, you know, key rock being in the market making and trading side, maple on the lending and borrowing side, we actually kind of want to get as much of a head start as possible. And so we're looking at how do we get around them and go to, like their clients to compete with them, to attract funds, or, you know, their clients on the borrowing side to compete to offer loans to them. And I think of this as like an innovator's dilemma thing. So instead of trying to attract the extremely large incumbents who have very highly refined tastes and are extremely discriminating in what they want in a product and willing to kind of walk away from deals, we want to actually kind of find the newer incumbents who might be competing with them and secure partnerships with them. So as an example, we've spoken with a ton of very large banks, like tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in assets. And the partnership conversations are extremely difficult because they don't have any real pressing need to do something on chain other than to satisfy their board that they're doing something interesting, but they have a huge whopping downside that they want to avoid.
00:31:29.884 - 00:32:07.148, Speaker C: And so where are we actually directing the conversation now? It's like community banks, because community banks since March have been in a much shakier position when it comes to funding. And so we can actually offer something that's much more appealing to them. Secure funding, longer durations, and it's a much more meaningful potential part of their business, or there's much more meaningful benefit to them of completing one of these projects. And so you, I think you have to go with this kind of innovator's dilemma approach of seeking smaller partners who can move more nimbly, but where you can make a bigger difference to their business. I don't know if you find the same on the, on the trading front.
00:32:07.196 - 00:33:03.236, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, the adoption, and I really like the, you know, the concept that you're saying, which is we need to stop looking for. When do the very large institutions get enter into defi. But just at what rate are institutions, either native institutions or institutions overall, wanting to use this technology? Because it provides value to them. And that value at the moment has to be either yield or access. Access to a new market where you can generate yield from, and I think, or naked yield. I think access right now is more of a value proposition just because either, even though you can acquire yield in your own jurisdiction, you get access to a much bigger market that you can target through on chain actions. Now, what is interesting for us is just the idea that, that like, as different financial primitives get built on chain, they start to differentiate themselves from the primitives that are built in traditional finance.
00:33:03.236 - 00:33:33.240, Speaker B: I think a lot of people in the industry are always looking at, okay, options markets and trif are huge. Let's build option markets. This, whatever is huge there, let's build this. Correct. And I think that copycat mindset, it helps. But at the end of the day, if the only reason that you would use this technology is because you can connect with your wallet and the settlement is a little bit faster, but the financial primitive is the same, it's going to take very long time for those institutions to find a real reason to move.
00:33:33.272 - 00:33:33.760, Speaker C: Correct.
00:33:33.872 - 00:33:37.440, Speaker B: But when they start moving is when the financial primitive shifts.
00:33:37.472 - 00:33:37.728, Speaker A: Correct.
00:33:37.776 - 00:33:45.700, Speaker B: I think the first time that there was real interest on chain was with the creation of Amms, because it's a new product, it's a new asset. Class, they don't have it.
00:33:45.732 - 00:33:46.316, Speaker C: Correct.
00:33:46.460 - 00:34:26.452, Speaker B: And it's just interesting. Now, from a revenue perspective, they didn't seem to be as profitable as they would want it to be. So like, interest fade out as the promise didn't deliver value as an investor as it was supposed to be. But an example that I find very interesting is at the moment there are few companies, companies in the industry that are starting to develop interest rate swap markets on chain. And these interest rate swap markets are still very small, but they are going to start enabling the digital asset industry to have fixed rates instead of variable rates. Right now we are in a purely variable environment. And as you probably know, when you go and buy a house, you can ask for a fixed rate.
00:34:26.452 - 00:34:55.924, Speaker B: You say, I want to take a mortgage 20 years and this is my fixed rate. And then you get to choose. You probably take the fixed one because you are not, not a professional trader and you just want to have predictability in your cost. We don't have that in chain. So some protocol comes in or multiple protocols come in that are developing this swapping technology. Swapping mechanisms. But they do it in a different way that how it's done in the ethics market all of a sudden is done with Oracle based market making systems.
00:34:55.924 - 00:35:37.054, Speaker B: It's permissionless. So you can attach rates of, of any other products, and all of a sudden you go to borrow an asset on AAVe and you get asked the question, do you want to borrow variable or do you want to borrow a fix? And as soon as those primitives that are differentiated start to provide real value, then as an off chain company, I can actually look at that and say, okay, this is actually very valuable for me because I can acquire a product store structure that I just don't have. And that's really where I think it's important to differentiate, which is the product needs to be a tenfold better than the existing product to acquire any traction.
00:35:37.094 - 00:35:37.598, Speaker A: Correct.
00:35:37.726 - 00:36:00.260, Speaker B: And I think that's done through really innovative financial primitives, which for me is the main reason that majority of on chain activity is not yet taking traction, which is that the approach of majority of foundations in the digital asset space is you want to build the uniswap of my chain, here is money, build it.
00:36:00.332 - 00:36:00.796, Speaker C: Correct.
00:36:00.900 - 00:36:39.684, Speaker B: But by definition, you just have a lot of copycat entrepreneurship instead of real financial primitives being built, and there are very few of those. But every time that you have a new financial primitive, you immediately see a spark of adoption. Immediately you see people coming in and making the effort to transition and change, to access that primitive. So my thesis on this is that as these primitives become better and better, as we have automated option markets, automated swaps, markets that have a ten fold improvement compared to doing this in an ethics broker, then you would see the interest really coming in because it's just better product. It comes down to it, it has to be better product.
00:36:40.024 - 00:37:33.678, Speaker C: Yeah, I tend to agree. You have to create something that's ten x better. And in the lending and borrowing space, you have the syndicated loan market or the market of large loans traded between banks, which can take 21 days, sometimes on average, to settle. And so that's kind of a boring example, but that speed is really important. But one mental model to think of is when the video camera first came out, you had people initially started by just trying to record plays. And then it was only later that the primitives of cinema and making movies actually emerged. And we're kind of, as David said, we're really in this early stage for crypto products and on chain primitives, where at the moment they just look like this Frankenstein version of what's in traffic.
00:37:33.678 - 00:37:50.250, Speaker C: But pretty soon, as with amms, we're starting to see versions that are kind of unique and not possible off chain. And we have to make more of those to really attract attention, because that's when you're competing in a category of one, instead of just being a new form of what's already very familiar to them.
00:37:50.442 - 00:37:58.770, Speaker A: Understood. Got it. And I guess just to go back to the point about the interesting fund that you made, about the innovators dilemma.
00:37:58.802 - 00:37:59.102, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:59.178 - 00:38:47.098, Speaker A: About instead of attracting more tradfi or incumbent players coming in, my opinion is that I think of crypto as a very capitalistic industry. I think even more so than non crypto, to be honest, because every interaction of a user is a value extraction. And in traditional finance and in crypto, I would say in crypto, yeah, obviously there is value extraction there. But in crypto, even a normal day to day user is facing the same. And with that regards, it is even more capitalistic. And in that case, wouldn't it make more sense to have basically more keep more of a capitalistic mindset and having just more capital coming in? That obviously, hopefully tries to be useful.
00:38:47.146 - 00:38:47.554, Speaker B: Obviously.
00:38:47.594 - 00:38:56.438, Speaker C: But yeah, if the question is, do we have enough of a capitalistic mindset.
00:38:56.486 - 00:38:59.834, Speaker A: You mentioned that you wouldn't want the trad five, folks.
00:39:00.454 - 00:39:59.070, Speaker C: Do we want more competition? Well, it's like Peter Thiel says, competition is kind of for idiots. So we would be kind of foolish to want really large banks to come in and compete with us on offering products just because they have orders of magnitude more resources than us. So we are trying to be capitalistic in terms of avoiding competition. And so we want to kind of, you know, at least our perspective is how do we get to scale and establish kind of a dominant footprint in certain categories, whether it's tokenized lending on chain, like real world asset lending, tokenized t bills, or lending over collateralized to, you know, to fund funds and trading desks, or prime broker style lending. But we ultimately want to kind of stake out differentiation. That's what capitalism is. You try and seek profit by differentiating yourself from your competitors such that you can preserve outsized economic returns.
00:39:59.070 - 00:40:58.272, Speaker C: And ultimately consumers will benefit longer term if there is more competition to kind of squash down pricing. But in the near term, you actually have to pay for that technology and that investment. And that needs to come from internally generating profits here. But if I look at the tradfi system, I would say that the banking systems, potentially, despite the fact that you have extremely large institutions like JP Morgan, it's a little bit more brittle than it probably was 20 or 30 years ago, because now you have this huge too big to fail risk where JPMorgan, something like 20% of deposits in the US system. And so they can't ever fail. And if they did fail, no one can ever bail them out. And so if you have this kind of new paradigm and these new emergent competitors, what blockchain offers us is a level playing field in terms of technology, where we're all kind of starting from scratch, having to learn how to use the blockchain and smart contracts.
00:40:58.272 - 00:41:39.844, Speaker C: But if it gives a chance you to kind of reset the competitive field, where you actually might have a lot more smaller players who are kind of even on a competitive field. And so the failure of any one or two of them doesn't make a difference to the overall financial sector. And it also leads to better competition, where consumers ultimately benefit from better prices because we're all competing with each other to offer them a better service. I wouldn't say anyone would look at what's happened in traditional finance and say that banks have really been competing, competing to offer great services to customers. The biggest catalyst for an improvement in banking services in the last ten years was Apple launching Apple Pay. That's the only reason in the US that they now have tap and pay, which we had sort of ten years earlier in Australia and other countries.
00:41:40.784 - 00:41:43.244, Speaker A: Makes sense. David, do you have any thoughts on that?
00:41:44.104 - 00:41:57.710, Speaker B: Look, I mean, I think I agree with everything in that regard. I mean, when it comes down to add, I think that if you're in this industry, you have to believe that money is not evil.
00:41:57.902 - 00:41:58.674, Speaker A: Correct?
00:42:00.854 - 00:42:30.266, Speaker B: It comes down to that. I think that if you're here, money is a tool, money is not evil. And then you use it to execute change. Of course, it's a very capitalistic environment, but I don't think that's negative in any way. I think that the underlying idea that a money driven model is inherently evil, it's what basically creates social inequality, because then society doesn't understand how to capture the best deal for themselves.
00:42:30.330 - 00:42:30.594, Speaker C: Correct.
00:42:30.634 - 00:42:42.010, Speaker B: Like, you need to have competition prices to go down. I mean, lending, there is no reason why lending rates in South America are 15% for mortgages today. There's no fucking reason for that.
00:42:42.042 - 00:42:42.402, Speaker A: That.
00:42:42.498 - 00:42:48.114, Speaker B: And if we can change that, that actually has a lot of impact. Should we make money by doing that? Hopefully, yes.
00:42:48.234 - 00:42:48.794, Speaker C: Correct.
00:42:48.914 - 00:42:53.386, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's my view on that. My two cent on that.
00:42:53.530 - 00:43:32.726, Speaker C: Yeah, but I think probably we're actually seeing limited markets. Like, it's not as competitive as it should be because there's a ton of large institutions who are prevent. Like who, if they are not explicitly prevented from. From participating, feel like they're prevented from participating because banks currently can't hold crypto on their balance sheet because of capital restrictions. A lot of trading firms who are regulated by the SEC feel like if they start trading crypto, they're going to get a world's notice. And so you're actually seeing distorted markets driven by the regulators. The regulator is creating market distortions that lead to worse pricing and a less competitive dynamic.
00:43:32.726 - 00:43:43.106, Speaker C: And ultimately, I think it's probably, yeah, it's probably not, to your earlier question, shaving, it's probably not competitive enough or capitalistic enough because of that distortion.
00:43:43.290 - 00:44:08.034, Speaker A: Got it. Understood. Cool. And I guess since we covered a lot of the questions about what people should be looking for on chain or overall crypto side, would be also great to dive down more on the importance of this different infrastructures in crypto. And what are the key mental frameworks that you guys keep in mind to basically assess them?
00:44:11.054 - 00:44:12.414, Speaker B: What do you mean by infrastructure?
00:44:12.454 - 00:44:36.774, Speaker A: Would be anything around layer ones, key pillars, like layer ones, wallets, custody, like, what do you guys actually, what are the key points that you guys have in mind? Or like, what's the mental heuristics around assessing them before you guys actually get to use them? And similarly, if you guys spoke to different institutions like non crypto, native inst, what are the thoughts that you heard from them?
00:44:37.074 - 00:45:17.370, Speaker B: We're still at the stage where majority of service providers of infrastructure have to be approached as a partnership. We're still at that stage. We're not stage where you can just go and say, this is this technology, this is the service fee you want to get it. It needs to be a relationship where most probably the technology is immature in a sense, and you need to accept that. And therefore, the only way to make it work is for both parties to understand that there is value to be paid for service, but also there is value on the adoption of the technology and helping that company to iterate. Typically, what we find is that as long as we are working with a custodian or an exchange that understand that the relationships go really well. What do I mean with.
00:45:17.370 - 00:46:17.346, Speaker B: That is rather simple. I mean, like, if you're building costly technology, the probability that your service out of the box fits my needs are probably very low. So the reality of it is that you would have a portion of customers as a costly company, for example, that will be able to use your service out of the box, but they will be not your primary customer because the amounts that they're going to be custoding are very small. Your major customers would have very unique needs at this stage, just because there are so many chains, many integrations, defi use wallets, whatever it is, and as long as they are okay with aligning a product development roadmap with the needs of their major customers, they can then co develop the business. We've done that multiple times with a lot of the infrastructure companies in crypto from back in the day. We were using copper already, like three years and a half ago. When they started, they had to adapt to what exchanges we were using.
00:46:17.346 - 00:46:24.602, Speaker B: How did they prioritize that or the development roadmap to try to make it a success? So my view on this is it has to be a partnership.
00:46:24.698 - 00:46:25.334, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:27.554 - 00:46:57.274, Speaker C: It does tend to be like an enterprise sale, where you're selling them something and they're selling you something. But what we look for more broadly in infrastructure is wallet support. So I think that was a big decision. When we moved to Solana, we had to look at all the wallets that were supported. I think fireblocks just coincided, which was really helpful. Stablecoins are probably one of the biggest pieces of most important infrastructure. It's kind of.
00:46:57.274 - 00:47:33.394, Speaker C: You're kind of a fish in the ocean, and the stable coins represent the volume of water that you can swim in. We can't do a ton of lending unless there's a ton of stable coins on a given chain. And so I think that's one of the chicken and egg problems a lot of l two s today are facing, is they lack that piece of infrastructure, a canonical stable coin that people can use there, but that infrastructure. So wallets, stablecoins on ramps are probably the three, three most important things I see for institutions choosing whether to work with firms like us.
00:47:33.774 - 00:47:52.074, Speaker A: Understood. And then with regards to, I guess, the broad layer one side, do you think there is much emphasis from different industries that you guys are potentially working with, they actually care about it, or what are the key features that they actually care about? From the l one side, I think they're broadly indifferent.
00:47:52.634 - 00:49:01.222, Speaker C: I think it comes down to the big buckets. So it's like you've got a jar and you've got large pebbles, small medium pebbles and small pebbles. The really big ones are just throughput cost and is there a business transacting on the chain? So overall liquidity, stablecoin, volume, TVL. And those are probably the major things they look at. But then when you get underneath that and unpack, what are some of the opportunities for them? I think they look at differential. One of the things I was really encouraged by coming here this week is things like the vending machines out there that you can pay with SPL, USDC with, and then deep in so decentralized physical infrastructure networks. And I put my lending and banking hat on and say, well, maybe not now, but you know, three or five years from now, could you see bond issuances or debt issuance that is used to finance the growth of deep in networks, whether it's wireless infrastructure like helium or could it be used for merchant facilities? So maybe you own a fleet of 1000 of those vending machines and you have pretty good cash flow of $10 million a month.
00:49:01.222 - 00:49:59.276, Speaker C: Could you borrow against that? Plenty of banks and credit funds already do transactions like that in traditional finance. And this is just, you know, we're in kind of the first innings of seeing whether things like that will turn into viable businesses over the next few years. But I don't see any reason why it wouldn't. Like, if you just look at the profit motive of somebody who's running a cafe, why do they want to keep paying 3% to visa and Mastercard when they can pay much, much less? And those businesses don't have huge profit margins to begin with. So something like payment processing on chain where you save 3%, it's pretty meaningful to their profit margins. And so I think if I'm a big convenience store or retailer, why wouldn't I look at using a network like Solana to kind of expand my business and then cut out costs that way? So that's, that comes down to kind of cost, but also level of activity on the chain. Level of activity is probably the single biggest one.
00:49:59.420 - 00:50:00.744, Speaker A: Got it? Understood.
00:50:01.574 - 00:50:57.036, Speaker B: Are a power user of on chain applications. We see ourselves as power user on chain applications. When it comes down to it, there is a minimum requirement for technology to be good. But above that minimum requirement, what really matters is the community around it. It comes down to it, in our view. Why do we use Solana and why do we use so much of the l two s on Ethereum? Is mainly where is there real innovation? Like, it's hard to pinpoint what makes it happen, but at the point that an ecosystem gets to the level where real entrepreneurs that are building or want to build crazy things that might fail or might work, choose to work in that technology, that's where it becomes interesting for us. Like in our point of view, at this stage in the industry, there are very few places where that's the case.
00:50:57.036 - 00:51:50.004, Speaker B: Majority of other ecosystems are in a catch up mode and their technology might be better. But that's not enough reason for you to adopt that technology, because ultimately you want opportunity and you want to have learning and you want to engage with real new financial primitives and new innovation. The way that I look at it today, we've been using Solana for quite a while, and we solved the Solana ecosystem as one of the only alternative ecosystems that went from catching up to what was built on Ethereum, to have real, differentiated applications that don't exist in Ethereum, and bringing new ways of thinking that were not possible before. And that's where it caught our attention. It became very interesting. So we were following already from the beginning. As soon as we started to see differentiated innovation, we jumped in, started to experiment.
00:51:50.004 - 00:52:57.904, Speaker B: And of course, we also still experiment today in ecosystems like arbitrum for the same reason. And as a matter of fact, we have a lot more activity on something like arbitrum than on ETH mainnet nowadays. Just because whatever the innovators go to is where you will be able to abstract the most learning and the most long term value as at least as an ecosystem company that is interested in understanding where this whole thing is going. If we're talking about just a user that wants to reduce cost, they're going to be looking at the technical specifications of the chain, cost of gas and so on. But I do think that that's secondary. As a matter of fact, most probably we're going to get to a point in a few years where majority of the scale scalability solutions on chain are going to start to be commoditized, where all of the chains that survive will be able to implement CK technology, all of the chains that survive will be able to implement modularity. And at some point, what really will be the differentiation is the community.
00:52:57.904 - 00:53:22.616, Speaker B: Today, technology plays a big aspect of building that community, but in the future, it will be the community that is really there. Correct? When it comes down to it, majority of network tech companies work that way. They might not have the best technology, but as long as they have a network, effective community innovation will keep on driving in and continue to grow. So today we're very active in Solana because of that. Of course. It's nice that it's fast and it works well.
00:53:22.800 - 00:53:23.536, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:53:23.680 - 00:53:35.248, Speaker C: But I think that specialization is really important to note any kind of any l one or l two today. Should we try to differentiate itself? Just compete on tech specs?
00:53:35.376 - 00:53:37.168, Speaker B: Yeah. I would be definitely keen to hear.
00:53:37.216 - 00:53:58.748, Speaker A: Your thoughts on your thesis for Solana. What is the make or break point for you guys, in terms of the technology or the ecosystem in general? Would be definitely great to learn from Sid about the lending aspects of it, and then would love to learn more about the trading aspect of it because of the fire dancer. It would be great to hear your thoughts on fire dancer and what it means for trading as well.
00:53:58.916 - 00:54:35.532, Speaker B: Okay, so, I mean, our thesis for Solana is rather simple. We think that starting from the builders, the capacity to build robust smart contracts on Solana is easier than in EVM chains. At the moment, that might change, but at the moment, applications build also are, from a developer point of view, more enjoyable to build, easier to build, and resolve to be more robust and secure, which attracts those innovators, which builds financial infrastructure that is differentiated, which allow us to then capture a new market.
00:54:35.668 - 00:54:36.132, Speaker A: Correct.
00:54:36.228 - 00:55:05.706, Speaker B: So it comes down from that. Like, how do you get the builders building? And so far, we are a rost based company ourselves. We've been developing, being in rost for the past five years, and we were very early in that community. We basically implemented ROS technology, one of the first crypto companies to do it. And we have an engineering team of more than 80 full time rust engineers. So whenever. When Solana started to get adoption and we could start building smart contracts in rost, for us, it was very appealing.
00:55:05.706 - 00:55:23.278, Speaker B: So our thesis is really that capacity to attract builders, which I find very interesting. Other chains are going that direction. So every chain that is building in that wave of how do you attract these differentiated founders? Is where we think majority of the accrued value will start for the next cycle.
00:55:23.406 - 00:55:34.794, Speaker A: And also would be great to hear your thoughts on finance and what it kind of actually enables for those of us that don't really understand the benefits of it for the trading activities.
00:55:35.674 - 00:55:53.714, Speaker B: Again, I'm going to stick to my last answer, which is, I don't think that technology would be the ultimate differentiator. I think that something like fire dancer would be great for the ecosystem because new primitives will be able to be built. But already today, Solana is faster than the other chains.
00:55:53.754 - 00:55:53.906, Speaker A: Correct?
00:55:53.930 - 00:56:18.974, Speaker B: So it doesn't seem to me that that is the bottleneck today. It's going to be great, but block times are still going to be very fast, as they are today for 100 milliseconds, and it might accelerate adoption for even bigger applications that are looking where to deploy. So that's really great. But I don't think it's a blocker today. I don't think we're in a situation where we are hitting a bottleneck. And that's why there is not enough innovation in Solana. I don't think it's the case.
00:56:18.974 - 00:56:28.214, Speaker B: I think actually, if any, the opposite innovation is great. It's going in the right direction and this is just going to be a tool that is going to supercharge the ecosystem.
00:56:28.514 - 00:56:31.194, Speaker A: Got it. We'd love to hear your tats as well said.
00:56:31.314 - 00:56:52.408, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it comes down to kind of three things. So I alluded to them in the last answer a little bit, but differentiated opportunities. So when we launched back on Solana about six weeks ago. So we first launched twelve months over. Twelve months ago. About 18 months ago. But we got back six weeks ago and we did cash management.
00:56:52.408 - 00:57:35.182, Speaker C: Just a simple place, if you're a protocol treasury, to park your stablecoins, and we've seen about 17 mil flow in there and we're just passing through yield from t bills. But that's not very like. That's kind of differentiated in terms of what's available on Solana at the moment. But as we look at the thesis of how do we expand our presence, we're looking at what Solana does uniquely. So I mentioned deep in the decentralized infrastructure. So if you're running a wireless network or a mobile network like helium, that could be something that we finance in future. So it's unique, it's potentially a large, addressable market.
00:57:35.182 - 00:58:13.044, Speaker C: It could be very, you know, it's very compatible with debt finance because that's a huge area of traditional finance. And so that's, that's one bucket of opportunities. The other is e commerce and merchant finance and payment processing. So visa and Mastercard, they're very focused on this because they probably stand to lose the most if everybody starts transacting in stablecoins on a blockchain. And so that addressable market is huge. There's large incumbents who could be disrupted by it. There's a lot of new, smaller competitors, and we could potentially find them in future.
00:58:13.044 - 00:59:26.490, Speaker C: And there's a clear mechanism where it's lower cost, so it'll attract users over time, and so that will power adoption. And it's something that's kind of to use that meme, it's like one of those only possible on Solana product use cases. That's the second opportunity. And then we touched on fire dancer before. But if you can get to an order or two orders of magnitude more trends, transactions per second, which is what they're kind of touting at the moment, then we could get back to doing what we were previously doing in terms of lending to hfts and market makers, because a lot of that activity could transition from centralized exchanges to occurring on chain and in defi. And so that's a third bucket where, again, really large potential addressable market, something where we have an opportunity to be an early mover and kind of stake out a plant a flag there, and, you know, which has already synergies with debt finance because we were already doing it two years ago. And so those three opportunities so deep in payment processing and e commerce and unlocking high frequency traders through fire dancer are three pretty unique things that, as I look across the landscape, are only really possible here.
00:59:26.490 - 00:59:28.050, Speaker C: And that's part of our thesis.
00:59:28.202 - 00:59:57.614, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much. So I guess in the interest of time, it would be great to hear some closing thoughts from both of you on what people attending breakpoint should be focused on. If they are catering to any more regulated plays, which I think you will be very, very familiar with, and in terms of catering to more trading firms, because there are a lot of hackers here that are building different DeFi applications, would be just great to have some closing thoughts from both of you.
00:59:58.674 - 01:00:02.402, Speaker B: So the question is, what should people be focusing on in the Solana ecosystem in general?
01:00:02.498 - 01:00:11.746, Speaker A: Closing thoughts on what people here are. It's a lot of people building different DeFi applications, which I guess would be more relatable to you.
01:00:11.850 - 01:00:33.434, Speaker B: So, I mean, my side very short, I think Solana is back, and I would encourage anybody to build on composability primitives on the chain. I think there is a lot of value to be unlocked there for the ecosystem where there is not yet enough synergies between the different applications in the ecosystem and whoever kind of unlocks that is going to capture a lot of value.
01:00:35.854 - 01:00:54.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. Solana is back. But what I'm paying attention to is who's building new DeFi protocols. I've met a lot of the DeFi 1.0 builders on Solana, and those teams have been really resilient through this kind of downturn. Now, I'm looking at who else is building DeFi stuff here.
01:00:55.794 - 01:00:56.538, Speaker A: Cool. Cool.
01:00:56.626 - 01:00:57.338, Speaker C: Thanks very much.
01:00:57.426 - 01:00:59.654, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Thank you.
01:01:01.714 - 01:01:02.654, Speaker C: Thanks, Sean.
01:01:03.274 - 01:01:04.194, Speaker A: Cheers, man. Thank you.
