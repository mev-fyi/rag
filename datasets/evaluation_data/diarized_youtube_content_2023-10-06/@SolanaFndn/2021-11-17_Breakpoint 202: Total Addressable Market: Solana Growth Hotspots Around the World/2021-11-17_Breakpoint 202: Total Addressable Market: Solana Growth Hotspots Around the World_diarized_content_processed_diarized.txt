00:00:24.600 - 00:00:48.370, Speaker A: A beautiful, good crypto morning to everybody. As you can see, we have a small change in the setup here. Lily was supposed to be the moderator, but she's not feeling well. She was eating too much glass. Is everybody currently in the crypto space? So greetings, Lily. Hope you're well soon. I have an amazing panel here with me.
00:00:48.370 - 00:00:53.084, Speaker A: And let's kick it off. I would like to ask Maggie to start with an introduction.
00:00:53.194 - 00:01:13.704, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah. To kill me first. Yeah. So my name is Maggie Wu, and I'm the CEO and co founder of Crypto Group and also Galactic holding company. So I'm a little bit complicated because I have two company. One is venture capital, also incubator that we invest a lot of project for past four years.
00:01:13.704 - 00:01:47.750, Speaker B: We found in 2017, and we invest over 100 projects. And from last year, we started investing a lot of project on Solana, too. Another company that I have is called Galactic holdings, and we're mainly focused on latent market. We're building an ecosystem over there with three components. One is crypto exchange called Maxo Mexo. One is largest in Latin, and the other one is a stable coin, which is the first and only one stable coin in the pack, two pesos. And we are also building a wallet still under development.
00:01:47.750 - 00:01:52.914, Speaker B: We're coming soon, the end of this year. So that's mainly the two company that I have. And thank you.
00:01:53.814 - 00:02:00.286, Speaker A: Awesome. You're currently the most attractive man in the room.
00:02:00.390 - 00:02:01.430, Speaker C: We take offense to that.
00:02:01.462 - 00:02:07.078, Speaker A: Hiring and educating rust developers. That's attractive. Please go ahead.
00:02:07.166 - 00:02:07.886, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:02:08.030 - 00:02:30.444, Speaker D: My name is Dima. I'm not from Bridge Tower Capital, but if you want to give me a share, I don't mind. I'm a Sioux and co founder of cybersecurity company Hacking. We are at the market more than four years and we are based in Ukraine. We are honored to be there. Land of developers. Land of cryptocurrency users.
00:02:30.444 - 00:03:11.882, Speaker D: According to chain analysis, Ukraine is one of the adoption of cryptocurrency in Ukraine is the number one. And we are helping Solana to find developers to convert them to rust. I would like to share some information about how we do it. You want it now? Maybe later. So, yeah, it's a difficult task, but someone needs to do it. Someone needs to educate people. Someone needs to explain why blockchain has a potential, why they need to start working on it.
00:03:11.882 - 00:03:14.986, Speaker D: And this is our task.
00:03:15.170 - 00:03:26.454, Speaker A: Thanks a lot. This is super important. I think developers are the most scarce resource at the moment. So I think you're doing amazing job, Leo. You're next.
00:03:26.914 - 00:03:53.544, Speaker E: Okay, my name is Leor Masika. I'm the founder and managing partner at Edenblock. We're a crypto VC that started operating about four and a half years ago. Yeah, we're based in London and Tel Aviv. We are also partners of Solana when it comes to funding israeli teams building on Solana. Israel is a pretty interesting region when it comes to developers as well. Maybe not like Kiev in terms of numbers, but really interesting stuff.
00:03:53.544 - 00:03:57.872, Speaker E: And yeah, I'm just really lucky to be here speaking to all of you guys. So thanks.
00:03:57.928 - 00:03:59.784, Speaker A: Awesome to have you, David.
00:03:59.944 - 00:04:33.914, Speaker C: Yeah. Hey everyone. Stevie here, the founder of Op Crypto, a newly formed venture capital firm. I was previously leading global strategy and investments at Huobi, the large exchange based out of Asia and also the internal incubation acceleration arm. So yeah, just launched a venture firm to better facilitate efforts to help some of the best projects globally to access the Asia market, work with the exchanges and have many people on the ground in Asia to help do the branding, marketing and go to market.
00:04:34.404 - 00:04:55.388, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks a lot. So also quickly about myself and Bridgetower. So Bridgetower is a global private equity firm. We have offices in the US, we have offices in Switzerland, also in Singapore and London. Very soon we're doing equity investments like a lot of private equity companies. But we also switched heavily now to token investments.
00:04:55.388 - 00:05:29.538, Speaker A: And by investing in tokens we realized we need to stake them. So we are currently building a huge infrastructure in Switzerland. We are operating validator nodes for ethereum two a lot of cosmos projects including terra persistence. And since actually this week we started our first Solana validator nodes. And we are super proud about that setup because it's banking great, so it's proper for institutional investors. And what we also very proud of, it's completely based on renewable energies. So it's only hydropower.
00:05:29.538 - 00:06:07.514, Speaker A: And it's one of our strongest hopes, wishes and goals to make the whole blockchain industry more or less sustainable by running validator nodes only by renewable energies. And last but not least, you know where we're calling it our private activities arm. So as you know, a lot of foundations, they're non profit, they are struggling doing real world business. And that's again the narrative while we are private equity firm. So we are trying to help these foundations doing real world businesses. So we are their partners to grow at the end their platform and their business. A great example is helium.
00:06:07.514 - 00:06:35.328, Speaker A: We are super proud to now produce to manufacture helium miners in Brazil. We are working on our coordinate rollout all over Latin America. We are proud partner of the Solana foundation. We are running the Solana European Ecosystem Fund. So bring your projects to us. And then we are doing a lot of activities currently on one of the traditional side. Right? So we are close to institutional investors and large investment banks.
00:06:35.328 - 00:07:16.126, Speaker A: So we are currently working on permission markets. So we are strong believers of decentralization, but we all know that regulation, sooner or later, will come. So we see the dark clouds on the horizon. And we are currently working on permission markets together with our partner, securitize. And we hope to bring these regulated sandbox ring fence environments very soon also to Solana. And, yeah, talking about, you know, at the end, regulated environments and markets, you know, we are pretty sure that we have different regions for Solana. And I would like to ask you to talk a little bit about your regions.
00:07:16.126 - 00:07:27.834, Speaker A: You know, we have Israel, we have Eastern Europe, we have Latin America, and we have Asia. So here we have the Solana world at the end and starting with Israel.
00:07:28.534 - 00:08:51.608, Speaker E: Okay? So, actually, that's a great place to start because Israel doesn't have a lot of Solana developers or a lot of Solana projects building right now, but they have incredible, incredible talent. Right? So, you know, a lot of R and D kind of centers are based in Israel for a lot of, like, web, two monolithic companies. And what we've started to see, at least so far, is that a lot of these amazing developers who are working at Amazon or Facebook or Microsoft or any of the other kind of large, I guess, technology powerhouses are actually now starting to realize the power that they have by just knowing how to build technology and knowing how to build products. And so I think, you know, so you've got this amazing talent. And on the other side of that, you've got the complicated story of just transacting over Ethereum. So a lot of people are thinking about decentralization as a foundational property, and I agree with that. But then there's a lot of use cases where that amount of security is just an overkill for, let's say, if you want to do a micropayment system where you essentially need to pay hundreds of dollars in gas just to run a small application or to even get something started to understand whether or not you have product market fit.
00:08:51.608 - 00:10:16.278, Speaker E: And so Solana is now starting to emerge as this amazing solution for all these new builders who are wanting to get into the space, who want to get stuck in, but are really looking for the right tools and infrastructure to build upon. Yeah, I think it's now starting to kind of get to a place where we understand, okay, all these developers are now swarming to crypto, but depending on what they're building, they're now starting to make the conscious decision of building on Solana, of building on chains, on a world that is basically multi chain. I find that really interesting because we're now starting to understand to a more intricate level, I guess, these different trade offs that a lot of builders are starting to make. Whether we're talking about, okay, I'm going to now adopt a chain that's going to decentralize over time, or I'm going to adopt a chain that's going to be more efficient and less expensive over time, like Ethereum. And we're seeing basically a lot of people, especially the long tail of use cases, go to Solana and other chains apart from Ethereum. And I think that that's a really huge opportunity for a lot of these amazing, talented builders because they know products. And so, you know, when you know a product so well or know how to build products so well, and you've got the right infrastructure to just scale at the pace of innovation.
00:10:16.278 - 00:10:39.810, Speaker E: I think that anatoly, one of the co founders of Solana, have said that at some point, then you're basically, you're getting somewhere. Right? And so we're really excited about, like, Israel starting to build on Solana, on other chains as well. And I think that this entire multichain universe is really starting to expand. And just seeing everybody here, it's like, yeah, it's obviously happening, right? So, yeah, yeah, I think that's about it.
00:10:39.962 - 00:11:09.810, Speaker A: Leo, you already brought the key message we wanted to bring in this panel, right. I think the USP of Solana is right now, the low gas fees. So we see all these emerging markets, all the developers, all, all the businesses are currently going to Solana. As this is the major USP, low gas fees, you can easily build and scale your business. And this is super important. David, I need to. Sorry for.
00:11:09.810 - 00:11:24.408, Speaker A: I have a quick question. China and the ban. Sure. So China is a super important region for everybody. Right. So how do you currently see what's going on? Let me know.
00:11:24.416 - 00:12:13.156, Speaker C: It's giving me all the tough questions and just jumping right into it. But yeah, I mean, happy to share my thoughts about China. I myself have spent the past ten years in China, not only at Huobi, but in traditional finance before and even launching and exiting a startup for myself. So really understand the market. It's heavily regulated, but at the same time, the government really wants to protect its user base and the massive growth that's happening within the China markets. So I think with the China ban right now, much of the ban is not necessarily innovation itself, but like, it's more so for the monetary control efforts with the monitor looking to make a better effort in controlling the money outflow from China. So that means like OTC, a lot of the trading efforts, a lot of the leverage.
00:12:13.156 - 00:13:47.814, Speaker C: But I think ultimately China is just looking to protect its retail consumers and investors. It's like similar and following track of the US where there's security laws, where there's things that you can and cannot do, and that's very clear cut in China, everything is still very much a gray area. I think they're very much shutting things down a little bit to better figure out how to govern the space, but at the same time putting the right frameworks in place so that startups in the ecosystem can really know how to flourish and how to navigate. But I think ultimately some of these regulations opens up the doors for DeFi to really come and be adopted in Asia. Because now people, instead of using like Colby, where we essentially had the largest market share in China by far, now we're seeing more DeFi products coming through and it opens, people are essentially forced to use some of these new DeFi protocols, DeFi primitives that are very much fit to be built on Solana, right? When you think about high throughput, low latency, low gas fees, these are all sort of the derivative markets, options, insurance, under collateralized lending, all these different new concepts that are not sort of fully unleashed as potential can be unleashed in sort of the asian markets where this massive adoption, essentially all the major trading volume comes from Asia. And that's where essentially all the biggest exchanges are. And that will sort of facilitate the new era of like Web 3.0,
00:13:47.814 - 00:13:51.254, Speaker C: reinventing the financial sort of infrastructure. Right?
00:13:54.514 - 00:14:11.958, Speaker A: Talking about Asia, I quickly need to take the indian and Southeast Asia region as well. You know, I think, you know, we see a lot of Solana hackathons at the moment, right? And I think some of the most successfuls are in India as well.
00:14:12.046 - 00:14:14.246, Speaker C: 400, I think 400, yeah. Applying.
00:14:14.270 - 00:14:57.968, Speaker A: I think for the last global hackathon we see application, we saw applications of over 3000 developers who wanted to participate and alone in India we had 400. 500. So India is clearly one of the hotspots at the moment in regards of Solana and also the NFT market, which is growing. But we also need to mention Indonesia. So Indonesia is becoming a very strong market for Solana. And we all know xie infinity, right? So I think all the southeast asian regions, these play to earn models. And this businesses, they will all migrate very soon to Solana.
00:14:57.968 - 00:15:44.958, Speaker A: And we see new upcoming projects in these regions. And I think it's not only increasing the TVL in general, but it's, you know, we, at the end, we, we soon need to talk about GDP and we really have at the end, the global countries, the Solana ecosystem. And you have people working at the end in these virtual metaverses and earning their income there. So Indonesia, as said, India very strong. And Solana is super happy to have Jangari as a new project coming to Solana. It's the TikTok now on the decentralized land. And I think we will see more of these Web 3.0
00:15:44.958 - 00:16:27.304, Speaker A: companies moving to Solana. Building on Solana. And I quickly need to mention one of our areas we are currently supporting in this is a cache. A cache is a decentralized compute network. So at the end it's like AWS or Google Cloud in a decentralized world. And we are super proud to announce that we, Bridgetower, will be a compute provider for the Acash network out of Switzerland and again based on renewable energies. So we are super happy to support this decentralization and building the infrastructure with a proper jurisdiction and based on renewables.
00:16:27.304 - 00:16:39.048, Speaker A: And we really hope to support all the Web 3.0 companies. But coming to Eastern Europe, the hotspot of the developers.
00:16:39.136 - 00:17:09.434, Speaker D: Yes. Yeah. So first of all, I want to say, like, Ukraine has inherited Soviet Union math school. So we have a lot of people, very smart people. For example, Anatolia Yakavienka, he's from Addesa, but he moved early to Bay Area. But at the same time we have inherited quite bad economy. And again, I see that this is a potential.
00:17:09.434 - 00:17:43.734, Speaker D: The young people like me, okay, maybe I'm not that young. We were building careers in outsourced companies, and some of us already have families and we don't want to move. We want to stay in Ukraine. And current young talents, all of them, they want to be in it. We have in Ukraine 100,000 engineer graduates per year. It's quite a lot. And our task is to convert as much as we can into crypto.
00:17:43.734 - 00:18:27.916, Speaker D: I want to share a few numbers. Because of the COVID the it developer market became global two years ago. The senior developer was salary was around three k USD per month and they were quite available at the market. Right now, the salaries have almost tripled. So who is a rust developer or a cybersecurity engineer? Usually they don't learn it at university. Usually they are converted from c plus. A middle dev can be converted in maybe two weeks.
00:18:27.916 - 00:19:15.902, Speaker D: The C developer average salary is around five to six k. In Ukraine, the Java developer can be converted, from our experience, in around one month, two months, and his salary is around four to five k. And again, from our experience, we see that young graduates from the university can be learned under supervision of the already existing Raas developer. Into four months, they can become quite strong. And then the salaries depends on how good are your entrepreneur skills. So this is our approach. We are going through universities.
00:19:15.902 - 00:20:06.274, Speaker D: We are partnering with the deans with them. So to give lectures about blockchain, about this industry, how it's growing, our approximation, like, if we speak about our own market, cybersecurity market right now, it's about $100 to $150 million per year. The turnover, we believe that in two years, it will go to 1 billion markets, and we need a lot of people. And in terms of our company hacking, I wish I can go more frequently to such beautiful countries and Portugal, you know, like, to move headquarters there. But my job is to stay in Kyiv and to grow these talents and convert them into Solana. And Solana, to be honest, not Solan to rust. It's important because you can.
00:20:06.274 - 00:20:25.258, Speaker D: The rust developer can easily write on solidity, but solidity guy cannot write on rust. It's like, no chance. So, yeah, my job is to stay there, build teams, and invite you there and launch products and projects in home country.
00:20:25.426 - 00:20:55.394, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks a lot. Teaching the young developers how to eat glass is super important. One additional question to you. You're also organizing a lot of hackathons, right? Yep. Do you currently also try to get more traditional companies right, be it out of the supply chain industry or healthcare, trying to bring cases to these hackathons? So are you also searching for partners out of the traditional industry?
00:20:56.014 - 00:21:18.966, Speaker D: Well, to be honest, I don't think that traditional industry understands the crypto world. So when you host a hackathon, like, if you invite a partner, he needs to put a technical task, and he cannot put a technical task. He doesn't know what he wants. Like, to write a distributed ledger. I don't know. For. Hell, I don't know.
00:21:18.966 - 00:21:42.056, Speaker D: Like, some bullshit. So we put the tasks and we find. We put the challenging task, but not very challenging to find the talents. Kakaton is about finding the talents, motivate them, grab them, and give them a direction where they can develop their careers and make some money. So, yeah, awesome.
00:21:42.240 - 00:21:50.040, Speaker A: Maggie, coming to Latin America, you know, it's one of the hottest regions at the moment. Tell us more.
00:21:50.192 - 00:22:39.462, Speaker B: Okay, yeah. So before I talk about Latin, I have to say something else, because we're us based capital, first of all. So we invest very globalized, not only Latin, and that's a little bit, unfortunately, the latin market doesn't have a lot of developers, the Burana Solana yet. But I will talk about the region later to, you know, have more information share with you guys, because I like we're building something over there, right? So I think for past two years that we have investor project that come from Russia and Europe and South Asia. Asia and also North America, but none of it from Latin. But it doesn't mean that it doesn't have a lot of good project over there. For example, like sandbags, even like axie Infinity, that start getting hot in Latin.
00:22:39.462 - 00:23:44.480, Speaker B: And I can see the trend is growing over there. But I think there's some insight I want to share, because before I came here, I actually did a survey with all the projects that I invest the build on the Solana. And they have, you know, just give me a lot of the feedback, like how they feel about Stellano. So I think I have the responsibility to share about their thoughts. And I think some of the people, they're from Asia, but they feel like, no, they want have more support from Solana because they really want to enter this industry and this ecosystem. But they think in terms of localization, I mean, it doesn't matter which region they want to have more support. And I think that's something that we can help if you want different regions to grow, for example, like Hakjam, right? And I think they must have something like India, what happened it very localized things that they can support for those projects.
00:23:44.480 - 00:24:34.060, Speaker B: And also, like some of the project, I think that they think, like, if a foundation, for example, like SVF, and like, he's just only one person, and if he can support one project, and for example, somebody just tweet and the project become like the hottest spy in the world. It doesn't matter where the projects come from, but how we can leverage that, how it can be more decentralized, how it can be more fair to everyone to enter this, how we can lower the barrier. I think that is something that I think we need to start about and how we can help them to grow. And that is the. I think this is the foundation. Eventually, every place could be a hotspot, not only just by regions, because I really want to see a decentralized world. It's not like, still put a border over there.
00:24:34.060 - 00:25:46.604, Speaker B: I want to see the border less and the beauty of the DeFi, I think this is it. And for the latin market I think it's quite special. They still in very early stage and the good thing is the regulation over there is very friendly, just kind of like us and the regulator are talking to authority all day long and they are really open to talk. And the thing that we build up there and we also bring like DeFi concept again five concept because they still like falling maybe top ten tokens on Coinmarketcap, bitcoin, Ethereum and they are not familiar with the rest of the tokens in the world. But we are building academy over there to teach people to share our projects and also do a lot of AMA and work with Kol and ambassadors from around maybe 30 something countries, Colombia, Argentina. I think that's amazing. You know, we're like literally go there and land over there building stuff little by little and I can see more and more people there get more interested in the industry and start building more things here.
00:25:46.604 - 00:26:05.284, Speaker B: So I really hope one day Solana can go there and host Hacktown over there. So you will help them, help the local developers to join this world and that probably can get mass adoption too. You know, I think that region has huge potentials. Yeah.
00:26:05.744 - 00:26:10.484, Speaker A: Do you see there's a language barrier at the moment. So Latin America, Portuguese.
00:26:11.104 - 00:26:53.012, Speaker B: So a lot of people ask me like, you're Chinese, you're living in states, why are you going to Mexico and you're building like a huge company over there. And I say like I'm lucky because I have a lot of good partners over there. They do speak English. At the same time they speak Spanish native and also Portuguese. And so I have no language barrier for me and my team to communicate with them in English. But at the same time I think they have good knowledge and a full of the passion and to study and you know, follow the trend and also deliver the messages to the communities. I think we did great job over there for past two years.
00:26:53.012 - 00:27:38.688, Speaker B: And the exchange that we built before we go there, like all the majority of the exchanges they're owning, you know, do bitcoin, ethereum, but we're bringing like over 70 different types of trading pair over there and start introduced one by one and do a lot of Ama's. And I think communities actually appreciate it now. Like we're top three in Latin and number two in Mexico. So I think that's amazing work by my team over there. Not by me, you know, but I think I do, you know, I think I'm the bridge to help the people over there to connect with the world. Now connect the phone around the world and also resources and good project no matter where the project is. But they're all interesting about the market and think I'm doing something like food, then I'm really happy for.
00:27:38.688 - 00:27:40.084, Speaker B: Yeah, awesome.
00:27:40.384 - 00:27:42.610, Speaker A: So then real quick covering again, also.
00:27:42.682 - 00:27:44.018, Speaker C: Europe, I just want to.
00:27:44.066 - 00:27:44.570, Speaker A: Please go ahead.
00:27:44.602 - 00:28:12.854, Speaker C: Sorry, just touch base because I only answered the regulation question earlier. But I just want people to know and realize how big the addressable market is in Asia. It's obviously a tall task. Asia is very, very big. And just speaking from past experience, when I first joined Huawei four years ago, it was about a million users. Now we're serving over 30 million users across 170 countries. And that's almost all just asian people in those countries.
00:28:12.854 - 00:29:06.806, Speaker C: That comes from sort of the native APAC market. But also at the same time, when you look at Asia, it's sort of the paradigm shift of some of the biggest social networks, gaming companies, game studios that are coming out of the Asia market. When you look at WeChat line Kakao, all these super apps that have even hundreds of millions of users that are just utilizing all sorts of applications for their daily lives. I think ultimately, with the advent of the web3 space, it really realigns some of the social incentives and really gives more power back to the end users. Contributors, content creators. Everything is really soaked up by all the profits are really generated by the more centralized entities. And you can see with TikTok, when even slightly, some of the more dividends and revenue sharing is given back to users, it really takes off.
00:29:06.806 - 00:29:35.456, Speaker C: It really allows people to contribute in a way where they have never seen before. And back to the point where you mentioned play to earn. That meta is definitely there to stay. It came from the Philippines. But at the same time, it's not just a game to these people, it's their line of work. That's what provides food for them on the table. But at the same time, it generated a whole new industry, right? That eventually it's not only being applied to gaming, you can earn in any sort of.
00:29:35.456 - 00:30:43.974, Speaker C: If you have a skill set, if you have a talent, you know, all the best talent around the world will no longer be hireable by some of the biggest corporations because, you know, they're not incentively aligned. Now you're able to take ownership of a piece of Internet, you're able to take equity in a protocol, you're able to have sort of some of those ownership structure where you're able to share a piece of a bigger pie with a bigger entity that you're able to contribute and make an impact in. And that's what excites people, especially for people in Asia, where they're sort of looking to make the next leap of innovation as well as the next level of adoption, to really take that off and really capitalize. And we, as a venture firm, we really want to help not only some of the best projects here out west navigate through the Asia market, but also give more support, like those in Asia that don't necessarily have the foundations, those support, and really, really try to bridge those borders and try to be helpful in sort of combining sort of these markets.
00:30:44.674 - 00:31:21.434, Speaker A: Yeah, this is awesome. Quickly, to summarize, we currently see that the blend of all these industries, right, it's the entertainment industry, it's also the financial industry and all the other traditional industries, gaming as well. And they're all blending together in one new global digital economy. And we have the contributors, the artists all around the world, participating and contributing to this ecosystem. Awesome. Real quick, I need to cover Switzerland and Europe. You know what we currently see in Europe, we have the financial hub in London, we have Frankfurt in Germany, and we have Switzerland.
00:31:21.434 - 00:32:08.588, Speaker A: We see the first interests of the financial industry. So a lot of people initially started working with Ethereum, but as already mentioned, the gas fees are very high. And it's not only for NFTs and the entertainment industry, it's also for the financial industry. You cannot build a trading system on top of Ethereum at the moment. So we really see the financial industry getting an interest in Solana. And, you know, we have projects like serum on cyclists, doing very precise order books on Solana. And there's a lot of education, what we are currently also supporting, explaining to the investment banks and also to other traditional players what can be done on Solana.
00:32:08.588 - 00:33:30.094, Speaker A: So the interest is really, it's exploding in the last couple of months, and we especially see it in London at the moment. So one of our partners, Halchecks building, also a fully regulated exchange, they are very interested in exploring all, all the possibilities in the space at the moment. And so slowly, I need to say, slowly but surely, we have the financial industry looking very careful at Solana, and not only to build, but also to invest, right? So we have a lot of global investors, be it from the asian regions or Latin America, and they all want to finance a custody providers, digital assets. If you're an institutional investor, you need to have a proper custody provider. So I think what we currently see in a traditional scientist, that these regions be it Switzerland, the UK and Singapore as well. They currently trying to build the infrastructure for Solana and all the SPL standards we have. So there's a tremendous interest in helping growing the Solana ecosystem in general, and we are happy to be a part of it, providing the validator nodes.
00:33:30.094 - 00:33:48.798, Speaker A: So I think this is also synergy. You have all the custody providers we need to have it for the SPL based tokens plus the validations and. Yeah, this is. I think the financial industry will be one of the top industries coming very soon and very strong to the Solana ecosystem.
00:33:48.846 - 00:35:07.470, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's actually an important point to touch on. What I find interesting at the moment is this entire idea of the race for DeFi. I think that there's so interesting to kind of think about it, because the amount of security you need in order to run financial systems is paramount to everything else, at least comparatively. Like when you've got the clear answer is you're probably going to prioritize security over efficiency in a lot of cases, which is why Ethereum has done so well with DeFi. We were just talking about this, me and a couple of friends yesterday at dinner, how right now the entire DeFi ecosystem on top of Solana feels very similar to what Ethereum felt like maybe four years ago, where today, if you look into DeFi protocols on Ethereum, they're usually based on other DeFi protocols. So if you guys have ever heard about gelato and some of their products, like sorbet finance, it's all about making it easier to interact with other underlying kind of protocols, like Uniswap, and making, let's say, an NFT, an ERC 20 token. Right? So that's like an example of the growing composability of DeFi within Ethereum.
00:35:07.470 - 00:36:35.834, Speaker E: And I actually think that we're starting now to see the burgeoning, I guess, ideas of building a truly kind of sustainable financial infrastructure on top of Solana. And I think that putting the D back in DeFi, in a lot of cases, a lot of decentralized finance is not really decentralized, even on Ethereum, because even when you're talking about the collateral, which sometimes is backed, you know, by. By dollars, like one of the most centralized currencies in the world. And so you're thinking about really, like, what is the degree of security of decentralization that is required in order for these financial systems to basically eventuate and then grow into what we would like them to be? I think there's an insane race right now to, like, build gradually more decentralized infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem so that this financial landscape can really build itself away from just one singular chain, which is what we know as Ethereum today, and maybe all of the roll ups that are going to come around. But really, I've been talking to so many different Solana developers who have been talking to me about, yeah, we want to build more decentralized infrastructure to enable this race for Defi. And obviously, when we look at the trajectory of many of these chains, especially Solana, there's only one way that it can go. It can go up and to the right.
00:36:35.834 - 00:37:20.570, Speaker E: In terms of all of the use cases and all of the demand for crypto networks and decentralized networks and smart contracts and all of these things, I think the financial use cases are probably the most important. It's really the golden egg that you want to reach. And ultimately, a lot of people are talking about the TVL, right? People are talking about the TVL. I think way before talking about the TVL, you can actually talk about the underlying infrastructure that can enable all of this TVL. And we're not talking about, like, $200 billion or $100 billion, you know, in DeFi. We're expecting $200 trillion at some point, right? At least if we do our job right. And so I think that a lot of that will have to come, you know, from a gradually more decentralized infrastructure.
00:37:20.570 - 00:38:27.098, Speaker E: And so I think that's been a really interesting point to kind of look into, because, like, Ethereum was building that, you know, for the last four years, and now you've got this growing composability and really interesting use cases. And we're starting now to see that in Solana. And I think that, you know, this this kind of bottoms up approach of Ethereum and the top down approach of Solana, in many cases, is gonna meet in the middle at some point. And this is why I think the race for DeFi is really interesting. And again, I believe, in a multi chain world, I think there's probably going to be a lot of value in a lot of very specific use cases going to Ethereum, going to Solana. But it's kind of like an interesting question, maybe even to bring back to everybody here, how do you guys maybe see that race for defi? And maybe we could spend, I know we've got seven minutes left, so we could try to characterize or spend some time thinking about, what are the use cases that you guys are seeing across Latin America, across Asia, across Ukraine, and across Europe that maybe do fit Solana? Best and that have been working really well. I know that you mentioned play to earn.
00:38:27.098 - 00:38:42.394, Speaker E: We mentioned a lot of gaming stuff. I think the last quarter had $5 billion in venture capital. Just go into gaming and metaverse stuff within crypto. So I don't know. I think that may be an interesting kind of question to bounce back to you.
00:38:43.334 - 00:40:03.688, Speaker D: Okay, so for those who doesn't know, yes, it's true that Solana is fast and cheap in terms of sending information. And the main business model of Solana is lice with the storage fees. And this means that some heavy project, for example, heavy NFT projects, they are not very financially efficient to be built on Solana. For example, we calculated one NFT project that had like 516,000 of tiles and stored some not very big amount of data. And it, it costs $2 million per year, which is huge for startup. So I think what is important when we speak about Solana is to explain to developers, explain to community what should be a direction of developers and where they should go. For example, I don't really think the direction of Solana should be in NFT space, but I'm very into DeFi for Solana and for example, micro payments.
00:40:03.688 - 00:40:24.340, Speaker D: I think this is like the best fit. And I would be like pushing hard if Solana will be worldwide accepted micropayments, unified system. That will basically revolutionize the whole thing. But the focus should be in place.
00:40:24.492 - 00:40:26.500, Speaker A: Maggie, I think this is exactly your topic, right?
00:40:26.532 - 00:40:41.344, Speaker D: Yeah, the focus should be in place. Like if we go to, if Solana goes to micro payments, then speak about it and don't support all the other projects that are spreading the focus.
00:40:42.204 - 00:41:26.322, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're mainly focused on three points that I think that eventually bring a lot of traffic, you know, can really involve the mass adoption. One is gaming. That's everybody already see it. And the other one, I think is social. So I think that's something that we were going to see, like you see on Facebook, you know, meta, they changed the name. And also, like, you can see maybe eventually that's like Twitter or telegram or those type of chatting or social media, it will involve like TikTok, right, from India, checkling. And also the other thing that we doing right now is a payment and remittance.
00:41:26.322 - 00:42:06.646, Speaker B: They use stable coin. And we are going to build out Solana. Now we're building on Ethereum, but the gas fees just insane, you know. And then we also work with Tron, but that's kind of like, you know, nothing compared to Solana. So we're going to build on Solana and also polygon maybe, but that will be really low gas fee for everyone. They can really benefit to all those people in Latin because like they really need a very high efficiency and save the cost. And, you know, so for them to do cross border transfer, that's huge business.
00:42:06.646 - 00:42:41.806, Speaker B: And that will be a daily uses at the same time a payment. I think that's a huge and huge thing that a lot of people didn't pay attention to it yet. And I also think that's a very high barrier because there's a lot of things that you need to involve with regulations. That's what I'm doing every day right now. Talk to regulators all day long. But I think that's the future. What I can see the future is like, you know, like Asavado for example, they announced bitcoin as a fiat and which means that can be illegally to use a payment method.
00:42:41.806 - 00:43:18.566, Speaker B: And I'm going to El Salvador right after this event for lat bitcoin. And that's very interesting. I can see like a lot of countries over there in Latin, they, the people over there, they unbank first. They are not just about a banking system and they're naturally crypto friendly. And most people, they're easily to accept crypto and no matter as a payment method or as a gift where as a collateral or no, even like compare gold. That's their thoughts. Okay.
00:43:18.566 - 00:44:23.776, Speaker B: They're not high trading values, but they're stories them. And also they want to use as a fiat and to give people and I think that's the use case that we can see. That's why we want to build wallets with the payment method and eventually can easily for people to pay to people instantly low gas fee, maybe zero, near to zero fee and very fast, you know, so I think that would be kind of like Alipay and WeChat pay in China. So people only with a phone, with a QR code, you can see the image that can go anywhere you don't need use via anymore and use their wallets and you can pay. That can really bring a mass adoption into the industry and really can help the industry grow because you need educate the user to use crypto first, get used to it, what they're doing every day. And then they will start using crypto for more things. For example like financial products, defi mining and staking.
00:44:23.776 - 00:44:35.104, Speaker B: I think that's too complicated for them. So what we try to do, we try to simplify those products and to mess the option so for them to easier to enter in this world. Yeah.
00:44:35.184 - 00:45:04.094, Speaker A: You know, I need to make a quick comment. You know, we see a european project at the moment, Credx. They are trying to bring venture debt to Latin America. So it's the mixture between Defi and also supporting ventures in Latin America. So we already see these global kind of new projects mixing Defi and focusing on special areas. Exactly. And this is super exciting.
00:45:04.094 - 00:45:06.294, Speaker A: We have 10 seconds left.
00:45:06.334 - 00:46:03.504, Speaker C: Okay, David. All right, I'll just go very fast. I mean, you guys kind of summed it up, but, like, I think ultimately what we're very excited about is just like, these high network effect platform plays where it creates a lot of user base and all of these users can really bring more value back to the platform. So us as a vc, we've already started to invest in the earlier stages of Chingari, of Aurora, of Stardust, some of the projects that natively building on Solana, that is taking some of these metrics to the extreme. But at the same time, you know, China and greater Asia, it opens the doors for a lot of these mass adoptions for, you know, these platform plays that, you know, go into, like, under collateralist lending, like I mentioned before, you know, micro payments by the means of, like, super fluid payments. Right, where, like, people can be paid by the hour instead of having monthly paychecks. And that can be very easily done at a global scale.
00:46:03.504 - 00:46:51.892, Speaker C: You know, things like prediction markets. That's essentially broken on Ethereum. Right. But I think having sort of a way to be able to better sort of have these oracles that ultimately utilize the low gas fees to have these more presented and be more functional on the Solana ecosystem. And lastly, like insurance, a lot of people don't really talk about it, but I think that's also going to be huge in Solana, building out a lot of these DeFi protocols. All of them are just a lot of people just APN and taking those sort of risk measures. But I think ultimately having the right protocols, having the different tranching systems to making sure you're accurately hedging your risk and being able to provide sort of more for the end retail consumers to protect their assets.
00:46:51.892 - 00:46:52.620, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:52.812 - 00:47:17.978, Speaker A: So awesome. I think, I hope we have been able to show that the emerging markets are coming and that Solana is having a clear edge due to everything low gas was and everything. Solana is super attractive for the merchant markets plus the european market. And next we have Alexis and rush. And I do not want to spend more time here. I think they have a great announcement. So thank you very much and see you soon.
00:47:18.026 - 00:47:18.314, Speaker B: Thank you.
