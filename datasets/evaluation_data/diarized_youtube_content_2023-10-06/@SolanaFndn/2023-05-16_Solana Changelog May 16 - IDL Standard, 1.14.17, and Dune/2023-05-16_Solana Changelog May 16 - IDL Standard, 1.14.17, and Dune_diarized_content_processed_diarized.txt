00:00:00.320 - 00:00:28.602, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's Changelog, where we go over the changes week by week on Solana. My name is Jacob. I'm joined today with Colin, and let's get started. So last Friday, we went through our second developer talk, spaces. This is a space that we can chat about the different things that are happening on Solana. Just talking about, like, a deeper dive as an engineer, like, what are the new features on Solana? What did you think of it, Colin?
00:00:28.778 - 00:01:00.434, Speaker B: Yep, I think it was actually really interesting. We also had, like, a lot of people, like, tuning in, asking different questions about the things that we were speaking about. And I think, yeah, it's just like a great, insightful way to keep up to date with everything that's happening and upcoming changes, especially when it's, let's say, API related things that may or may or may not affect some of the programs that you currently have. So it's a good way to kind of stay up to date with everything developer, right?
00:01:00.474 - 00:01:33.342, Speaker A: So if you ever have any questions for us about things that are happening within the developer ecosystem on Solana, feel free to join the spaces. Or you can really just tweet at us at any point in time. We will be going live every Friday at the Twitter account. You can see the space will be scheduled there. We would love to have you all join and ask any questions that you have on a different spaces. News we had a space this past week with Zenlong on Twitter about the 114.17 release.
00:01:33.342 - 00:02:13.024, Speaker A: So too long, didn't read one Dot one four Dot one seven is undergoing kind of a release process right now. As of the time of this recording, it is at 10% deployed to mainnet beta. The processes 10% was going to be this previous Monday, and then the following Monday I think it was going to be a call for 25%. And the Monday after that it'll be a proposal to upgrade fully to 100% on 114.17. If you have any. If you have any interest in what's going on with the 1.1 417 release, you can check out the spaces.
00:02:13.024 - 00:02:26.784, Speaker A: We go through all the different features that are on this new release, this 1114.17. So you can check out the space, listen in and let us know what you're excited for.
00:02:26.944 - 00:02:58.564, Speaker B: Yep. So moving on to the proposals. Today we're looking at the SRFC zero zero eight, which is for the IDL standard. And I guess this is just to develop a standardized interface that would be used as the. For an IDL. And I think currently the main problem is that if you have an anchor based program. There's of course an IDL that gets shipped, but if you develop natively, like some of us, there's like no in built way to have an IDL.
00:02:58.564 - 00:03:19.812, Speaker B: So I think this is just a way to have like a standard across the board that whether you're using anchor or native. And I guess in the future, when other frameworks come into play, there's just like one standardized interface that will be used, which kind of makes it very easy for, let's say, RPC's indexes and explorers to gain more insights on your program.
00:03:19.988 - 00:03:28.580, Speaker A: So this is just to separate the IDL from anchor and make it more generic and used throughout the Solana ecosystem, right?
00:03:28.692 - 00:03:41.824, Speaker B: Yep. And I guess there's going to be a lot of people with almost like varying opinions on this. So, yeah, definitely worth getting involved in the conversation now so that your opinions are heard.
00:03:42.154 - 00:04:07.774, Speaker A: So yeah, if you're interested in joining the conversation, you can go to forum dot solana.com. You can go under the SRFC section. This is the SRFC eight, and you can comment there and join the discussion. Moving on. So the commit that I saw was something about the debugging and tracing capabilities added to the ledger tool, which was previously the RPBF CLI. Do you know what the RBBF ClI was?
00:04:09.174 - 00:04:38.234, Speaker B: This was actually the first time I came across it myself, but what I found out was that it's a standalone tool that you can use to run, debug or test and analyze on chain programs locally without having to run a validator. I just found it super interesting, but as soon as we found out about it, it gets yonked from us. But now it's just that it's now available via the Solana Ledger tool.
00:04:38.784 - 00:05:04.886, Speaker A: Okay, so debugging and testing programs without running the validator, that sounds really cool. I wonder if it's very similar to how Bokin debugs programs locally. I see. This is also done by Dmitry at labs. He recently wrote a guide of how to debug programs locally. So this is likely an improvement on it. Definitely check it out.
00:05:04.886 - 00:05:57.224, Speaker A: There will be a link in the description. And then this week's resource of the week is the Dune analytics, recently released how they can do Solana decoding on their Dune platform. So Dune is an analytics platform that provides a lot of different information about Solana data on chain. This is allowing them to decode what is going on on chain and presenting it in a more human readable format. So if you use them today, you can get some information using like the idls for anchor so that you can read what is on chain. A great example is using bubblegum or the state compression program. You can now get the state compression information of how many mints are happening in real time using Dune.
00:05:57.224 - 00:06:28.540, Speaker A: So if you look at the graph which should be shown right now, it should show that like, hey, this is the Canon machine v. Two mints. You can see that they're kind of going down. But then the version three canon machines started getting used and then Bubblegum got released, which is compressed notice and our mints just exploded, which is to be expected because it's a lot easier to mint now. It's really cool. You can now see that with Dune and more. So if you have an idl that you want to read on Dune, you can submit it.
00:06:28.540 - 00:06:40.612, Speaker A: They have a form in their tweet thread and Dune themselves will use those idls, decode your program and be able to display them with their analytics platform.
00:06:40.788 - 00:06:58.784, Speaker B: And that wraps up this week of changes in the Solanda developer ecosystem. Don't forget to join us the same time next week. And again, the quick plug for our Twitter spaces on Friday. Please tune in and get some more insights on what's coming up next. So see you until next week.
00:06:59.284 - 00:07:00.164, Speaker A: Thank you all for joining.
