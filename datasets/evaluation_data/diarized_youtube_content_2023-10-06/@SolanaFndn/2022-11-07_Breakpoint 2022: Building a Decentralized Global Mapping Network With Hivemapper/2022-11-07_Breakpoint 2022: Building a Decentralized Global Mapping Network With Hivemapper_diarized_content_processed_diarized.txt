00:00:02.000 - 00:00:26.930, Speaker A: All right, well, thank you. Thank you, guys. This is my second breakpoint, so it's amazing experience. Looking forward to next year's already. So I'm here to tell you a little bit about Hivemapper, give you kind of an inside look of what it took us to get to this point. But before I do that, make sure everybody knows a little bit about Hivemapper and what it is and how it works. So this is a dash cam.
00:00:26.930 - 00:01:17.204, Speaker A: It's a dash cam that looks and smells like a lot of other dash cams that you may have seen if you're at an Uber car or lyft car. But it does two very, very special things. So the first thing that it does is it actually collects imagery that forms the basis of this decentralized global map that we're building together. Okay? So all of that imagery, all of that location data that is coming off that dash cam is ultimately making it up to Hivemapper, where we're building this global map. The second thing that it does, it actually mines crypto and it mines honey tokens, which is the cryptocurrency of Hivemapper. Ok? All you need is that dash cam that we just saw over there, plus an app that runs on iOS or Android. Those two things seamlessly talk to one another to help build this map.
00:01:17.204 - 00:02:01.556, Speaker A: And so ultimately, you get rewarded for doing something that you do every single day, which is drive, or, or many of you do every single day, which is drive. So we're not asking people to go out there and drive for the purposes of mapping for hivemapper. We actually discourage it. We do not want to put additional cars on the road. But if you happen to be an Uber driver, Lyft driver, if you're just going to work or to a soccer game or wherever you need to go, this is going to reward you for doing something that you're already doing. And so what do you earn? You earn honey tokens. And so the really cool part about this is that it's now live, so you can be mapping anywhere, anywhere in the entire world and earning honey tokens with a hivemapper dash cam.
00:02:01.556 - 00:02:30.564, Speaker A: So what's awesome is that we actually just went live. I think it was one day before breakpoint. So it's been quite a hectic week. So I want to give you guys a little bit of insight into kind of what it took us to get here. So last year I mentioned was my first year at breakpoint. So for the past year, we've kind of gone heads down and have been building the Hivemapper dash cam and this decentralized global map. So we've tested over 200 of these devices in about ten countries.
00:02:30.564 - 00:03:15.560, Speaker A: All of these devices have racked up about 28,000 road kilometers all over the world in places that are really hot, like Las Vegas to Manila, to Lagos, Nigeria. So we've really ensured that we're tested this device very thoroughly in many, many different parts of the world. The longest drive that we've done is about 8 hours. So somebody drew it from San Francisco, where we're based, all the way down to San Diego. All right, so we've been taking preorders for the dash cam since April, when we kind of came out of hiding. And so there's about 6000 preorders that we're now in the process of fulfilling. People have ordered these dash cams from over 66 countries and roughly 2100 cities.
00:03:15.560 - 00:03:50.494, Speaker A: You can go buy one today. And when you buy one, we'll hopefully start to ship them. Well, we're shipping them out every single week now. So if you buy one today, you'll probably get it by the end of December. Okay, so when we built this dash cam, we obviously were building a dash cam for the purposes of mapping. And we wanted to make sure that the device was actually supporting the three key priorities of the map coverage, freshness and map quality. I'm going to take you through how the dash cam actually supports those three major priorities.
00:03:50.494 - 00:04:16.528, Speaker A: So this is an image taken in rural Pennsylvania. On the right hand side is the image from Hivemapper. On the left hand side is the image from Google street view. The cars are the exact same position. And what you're going to see in the next slide is there was a sign up to the right of that. And here's what you see from Hivemapper. And here's what you see on the left hand side from Google's review.
00:04:16.528 - 00:04:22.320, Speaker A: Why is this important? It's important because if you can't see stuff, then you can't map it.
00:04:22.392 - 00:04:22.840, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:22.952 - 00:04:52.718, Speaker A: And so we wanted to make sure that the camera that we're building was able to see all these little details that are around us every single day. Parking restrictions, the name of a business, the hours of operation in a business, a speed limit sign. Even if the car that the dash cam was mounted in was at a significant distance from all these little signs, the next thing we make sure was that when a dash cam said that it was actually at a very specific location, that we could trust that it was at that location.
00:04:52.806 - 00:04:53.434, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:53.774 - 00:05:01.758, Speaker A: If we don't know that the car is let's say 19th and Broadway, but it actually turns out to be, it's at 20th and Broadway. Those are two very different things.
00:05:01.806 - 00:05:02.200, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:02.302 - 00:05:50.174, Speaker A: Or even if it's in between 19th and 20th, those are two very, very different things. So the positional accuracy, which basically means do we trust the location of the dash cam is less than 3 meters and it maintains that for about over 80% of the drive, which is quite good. Ok, so where does Hivemapper's cost advantage come from? Many of you probably seen a Google Street View car. Each of those Google Street View cars is roughly half a million dollars all in. Okay. A Google Hivemapper dash cam is on average about $500. So what does that mean? For $500 million, we can have a million dash cams all over the world, whereas Google, for a $500 million investment, only has about 1000 Google's preview cars.
00:05:50.174 - 00:06:28.742, Speaker A: So what does that mean is we're able to see locations much, much more frequently, right? So over a course of like, on average, Google Street View car probably sees a location once every two years. Hivemap are able to see that 24 times. So not only are we getting fresher data, but we're also getting higher quality data. So here's another image of Google Street View that happened to see this location when it was dark out, right? Or the lighting wasn't good. So that's the image that they have, and they're stuck with that image for the next two years. Okay. If we collected a bad image because the lighting was bad one day, that's okay.
00:06:28.742 - 00:06:33.910, Speaker A: We're going to see that location another two weeks or another week, and we have another shot on goal.
00:06:33.982 - 00:06:34.550, Speaker B: Right?
00:06:34.702 - 00:07:15.554, Speaker A: So the team that usually gets more shots on goal usually wins, and we just get a lot more shots on goal. Here's kind of a better image of that same location. Okay. So I think yesterday we saw a little bit about helium and how they're building out this massive Iot network, which is really cool. We use helium and we use helium to verify the location of all of these different dash cams. We understand that there will be spoofers or people who will attempt to spoof, and it's very, very important to us to ensure that we thwart all of these potential spoofers. And so we use kind of multiple layers to do that.
00:07:15.554 - 00:07:38.994, Speaker A: One of those layers, which is a very important layer, is embedded inside of the hivemapper. Dashcam is support for the helium network. So we've been at Hivemapper for a while, and I want to share with you a little bit about two different case studies of. Before we had the Hivemapper dash cam, we were using a third party dash cam. So this is ultimately what customers really care about.
00:07:39.074 - 00:07:39.578, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:39.706 - 00:08:07.492, Speaker A: They want to know how much coverage we have in a specific region. They want to know how. What is our refresh rate? So, in Manila, for about six months, where we had a whole bunch of drivers driving around, contributing to the map, we got to about 99% coverage. Sorry, 95% coverage. And this is the really cool part. 75% of the Manila region was refreshing every single month. Okay.
00:08:07.492 - 00:08:33.740, Speaker A: Manila is relatively small. It's about, I think, what, 11,000 road kilometers. So we wanted to make sure that it worked in a much, much bigger region. Here's Los Angeles. Los Angeles is massive. It's about 100,000 road kilometers. We got to a point where we got about 56% coverage in six months, and we were refreshing roughly 30% of LA region on a monthly basis, which is also really good.
00:08:33.740 - 00:08:43.616, Speaker A: So when customers are looking at this, this is what they're asking for, and this is why they're buying. So I'm gonna share with you a short video here.
00:08:43.800 - 00:08:57.480, Speaker C: Hive Mapper. Hive, like the beehive. It, is a decentralized mapping network. And I'm like a wee worker bee, helping to build a big global map just by driving. And they pay me in crypto.
00:08:57.672 - 00:08:59.912, Speaker A: Wait, did you say you get paid in crypto?
00:09:00.008 - 00:09:02.744, Speaker C: You get tokens just for contributing your mapping data.
00:09:02.864 - 00:09:04.174, Speaker A: What crypto do you earn?
00:09:04.304 - 00:09:05.054, Speaker C: Honey.
00:09:05.634 - 00:09:10.930, Speaker A: Oh, hive honeybee sick.
00:09:11.122 - 00:09:27.374, Speaker C: And it's so easy to use. All you have to do is place the hivemapper dash cam in your car. It automatically uploads street level images via the Hivemapper app, and then the app deposits honey cryptocurrency into your account just for doing something you do every day. Mm hmm.
00:09:27.834 - 00:09:29.840, Speaker A: Nah, that seems too good to be true.
00:09:29.922 - 00:09:35.904, Speaker C: Well, they said the same thing about sliced bread back in the day, but it was true, and it's the same for Hivemapper.
00:09:40.604 - 00:09:54.260, Speaker A: So a little bit about that ad that's running all over in many, many, many different regions of the world. It's really important that we don't just talk to folks within the crypto community or folks within the mapping community, but we extend beyond that.
00:09:54.412 - 00:09:54.772, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:54.828 - 00:10:08.030, Speaker A: There are so many people like Uber drivers and FedEx drivers and Lyft drivers and folks like Yvid, like this lady who's driving, that we need to be able to talk to and we need to be able to talk to in very simple and plain language.
00:10:08.142 - 00:10:08.654, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:08.774 - 00:10:13.054, Speaker A: You start talking about crypto and mapping stuff, they're not interested.
00:10:13.134 - 00:10:13.638, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:13.766 - 00:10:54.004, Speaker A: And so it's, how do you really talk to the things that are interesting to them and are motivating in very simple language? And so that's one of the things we're going to do. All right, the highmapper dashing on. I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the capabilities in here from a customer perspective and a contributor perspective, and then we're done. Okay. A lot of people say to us, why did you guys build a dash cam? Why can't you just use an iPhone or an Android device? Well, that may be okay from a contributor perspective, although I think there's some issues. What I'm going to share with you in a moment, but from a customer perspective, that's a big problem. And the reason that's a big problem from a customer perspective is because they need data consistency.
00:10:54.004 - 00:11:59.884, Speaker A: If we were to support Android, think about all the different types of cameras that are supported on Android, even iPhone. Now, there's like, what, 1314 different iPhone versions out there. There's so many different camera resolutions, camera image sizes, and so forth, that from a customer perspective, that's a nightmare. And so the himapper Dash cam and all those that will follow will have a very standardized image quality, resolution, color balance, so that the customer, which is ultimately what really matters here, is getting that data consistency that they so crave. The other thing is, if you ever try to mount an iPhone or an Android into your car, well, first of all, most people want to use their Android or iPhone device while they're driving, right, for mapping and navigation, to listen to music, take calls and so forth. They don't want it mounted right below their, the rear view mirror like you see over here. And so the dash cam is really designed to be something that you can mount in about ten minutes and then just forget about it, right? Like it should really.
00:11:59.884 - 00:12:42.838, Speaker A: It has to, like, ultimately become entirely passive. And so we said to ourselves, how do we build a dash cam that you could just mount it once and you just forget about it? And the other cool thing is that the data from a data upload perspective is entirely passive. So the way this works is all the dash cam image relocation data gets moved to your iOS device or your Android device, and then when you connect to Wi Fi at home or the office, it will automatically upload it. So it's kind of like if you have Google Photos upload, it'll just automatically upload the data for you at night or in the middle of the day. Okay. The last part here that I want to leave you with is privacy. This is really important to me personally.
00:12:42.838 - 00:13:15.784, Speaker A: I do not want to create a global location surveillance system. And so when we think about privacy, we think about privacy from the perspective of the contributors, but also everybody else. This dash cam is taking pictures in the real world. If you happen to be walking by, we will automatically blur your face. I want to ultimately go further and just blur your entire body or remove the entire body from the images. Okay, so that's number one. Number two is we also think about it from the contributors perspective.
00:13:16.124 - 00:13:16.556, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:16.620 - 00:14:03.230, Speaker A: If there's a million people out there mapping, we don't want to know who these million people are. And the reason for that is because if somebody comes to us from a government who's maybe not super friendly, says, who's that person who's mapping? I want to be able to say with a stray face, we don't know who that is. So we don't want any personal information from the people who are contributing. So all the usernames that are being generated in hivemapper are anonymous, and all the GPS data that's actually being collected is fully encrypted. And so this is really important. If you start to rethink the process of building maps and you say to yourself, how do you do that from a very, very privacy centric, you start to build the map in a very, very different way than I think it's historically done by Google and others. So thank you guys so much.
00:14:03.230 - 00:14:06.134, Speaker A: This has been wonderful. Appreciate your time. Have a great rest of the breakpoint.
