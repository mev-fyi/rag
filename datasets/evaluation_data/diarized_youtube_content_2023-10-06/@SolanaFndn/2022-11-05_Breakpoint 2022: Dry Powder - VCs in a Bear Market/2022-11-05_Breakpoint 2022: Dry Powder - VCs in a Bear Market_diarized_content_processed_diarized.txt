00:00:00.240 - 00:00:25.150, Speaker A: Yes, it is. Welcome to the talk. We're going to hear what Kyle Simone does in a bear market. But before we get to that, I'm joined today by my wonderful guests. We want to dive into what's going on in the market, how it's changed in a year. I remember this time last year in Lisbon, it was a very different kind of conference, a very different kind of market, and the top's really blown off of it. I'm sorry, my voice is gone.
00:00:25.150 - 00:00:45.342, Speaker A: I've been talking about the Phillies too much, but the top's really blown off on the market, and it's a different environment, and we want to hear from these paragons of the investing world in crypto, how they're approaching it. So we'll start off with that question. Kyle, what do you do in a bear market?
00:00:45.518 - 00:00:48.874, Speaker B: Mostly I just call Amy and ask her what she's doing, and I copy her.
00:00:49.214 - 00:00:54.194, Speaker A: All right, well, vice versa. Go on.
00:00:54.494 - 00:01:07.914, Speaker B: No, I mean, honestly, the same thing we do in bull markets, like meet entrepreneurs, read, think, talk to people, write checks. Like it's slower now than it was a year ago, but same core objective, same core substance.
00:01:08.654 - 00:01:24.994, Speaker A: Are you seeing a difference in the types of projects, the speed with which deals are closing, the activity in the space? Certainly there's some difference now than relative to a year ago. Like, how are you experiencing that from your side of the thing?
00:01:25.734 - 00:01:26.994, Speaker B: Y'all want to take it?
00:01:28.294 - 00:01:56.634, Speaker C: Sure. So I think overall, the speed to deal closing has definitely slowed down. I think that you certainly have to make a few concessions to the market. But people take different approaches at different shops. At Sino, we don't outsource or due diligence. So our speed to close probably has not changed materially. But overall in the market, for sure, there's a huge difference in both the number of deals, especially at smaller check sizes, and then for sure, speed to close.
00:01:57.174 - 00:02:29.906, Speaker A: And let's talk about due diligence. I mean, one of the big stories for myself this year was about the sabre ecosystem and understanding what is actually going on behind the scenes of some projects. One in particular, this wasn't a case where I don't know if investors were lied to, but the public certainly was. And it was a case where due diligence might not have been done to the extent that it should have been. So, Amy, just from your perspective, how are VC's approaching due diligence and what are their obligations in this space?
00:02:29.970 - 00:03:13.358, Speaker D: It's definitely changed quite a bit since last year. During a bull market, there's a ton of FOMO I would say, and we're talking about how deals were getting done. Term sheets were signed within 24 hours. And so the thing is, like, someone would need to, would commit, and then immediately the rest of the round would come together almost without almost any diligence. It was just around the signal of the lead investor a lot of times. And that's not, you know, super healthy, I would say, especially because a lot of the projects, you know, maybe not as, like, long term oriented, you know, not different qualities of, you know, skill sets and talents out there as well, and just thinking about what they're building. And so now things have slowed down.
00:03:13.358 - 00:03:42.134, Speaker D: I think it's good for everyone involved, and I still don't know that everyone is, I would say, doing on chain diligence, for example, and actually, like, checking into some of the numbers that the projects are saying, but more like reference checks on the founders, seeing like, there's the founders. A lot of the channels also have a longer track record of working in the space. And so that in itself kind of speaks volumes to, again, whether they're long term oriented or not. And I think all that's, like, healthier.
00:03:42.954 - 00:03:57.454, Speaker A: And, Min, you're probably in the best position on this stage at the moment to talk about the transition between different ecosystems. What do you see the differences between, let's say, the Ethereum ecosystem and the Solana ecosystem from a venture investing perspective?
00:03:57.994 - 00:04:59.356, Speaker E: I think right now we're squarely in a multi chain world. So, you know, it's not so much that one ecosystem is more resilient than the other. In fact, I think one thing that was really exciting about Solana over the last, say, 18 months was just a number of new developers and new participants that they brought in crypto in a way that made it very, very accessible. And we saw a lot of interesting innovation building the Solana ecosystem that we hadn't really seen. Ethereum that has been very, very focused on protocol, infrastructure and scaling, particularly on the NFT side, think like, Solana has a very vibrant ecosystem. So we really think about it more from the perspective of what chain is most suitable for building what kind of project, and assess it accordingly, and especially for founders. Like, well, why did you choose this particular l one, not just from a technical architecture point of view, but also from a community building perspective, because the shape and structure of each l one ecosystem is very different.
00:04:59.540 - 00:05:16.720, Speaker A: And, Kyle, do you think that there's a. My voice is cracking if I go too high. I'm sorry. That idea of different l ones for different purposes in this sort of market. It's hard to get new people into crypto.
00:05:16.752 - 00:05:16.920, Speaker C: Right?
00:05:16.952 - 00:05:37.904, Speaker A: We're sort of, no, we're not preaching to the choir, but there's the people who are already in, who are excited about building, excited about investing, excited about whatever it is in this crazy world that we all live in. So it's a matter of appealing to them regardless of where they are. What's like the value proposition of Solana at this moment?
00:05:40.044 - 00:06:25.516, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, if you go back to the original keynote Vitalik gave when he launched Ethereum, this is January 2013, I think, or maybe January 2014. But in it he outlined his kind of motivation for building Ethereum, which was, hey, people had ideas for interesting things beyond bitcoin. There was namecoin, there was a few other things of that era, I forget the other ones. And they were all building blank full chains with consensus and different Utxo sets and mining and whatever. And it was really complicated if you wanted to launch a single app to deal with all that complexity. And so he launched Ethereum because he said, aha, what if you can abstract all of that common stuff and just have a layer to write smart contracts? And that was how Ethereum was born.
00:06:25.516 - 00:07:00.854, Speaker B: It was a very clear distillation of the core problem and then an elegant solution to the problem. What's happened is Ethereum has been dealing with scaling, has been, they broke that core premise of saying, well, look, just don't think and throw a contract on the chain. And that's it. That's what made l one so successful, was just like the dumb simplicity of the whole system, no thing required, throw it down. That's it. And that very much is what Solana represents. And that's why we've been so drawn to it from the very beginning, which is like, it maintains that sheer simplicity.
00:07:00.854 - 00:08:06.944, Speaker B: If you look at an iPhone, right, like Apple kind of sort of controls the whole iPhone, they control the hardware, the operating system, all that stuff. You need a cell phone carrier, and like, really those two pieces make it work. But if you look at any actual blockchain application, you need an l one, you need on ramps, you need wallets, you need indexing and query providers, you need application providers, you need whatever. All these other things. And the fact that all of those things are more or less built by disparate parties and they all actually come together and work and you can actually have a real functional application is actually pretty amazing. And I kind of think about like, you know, what is the total amount of ecosystem complexity required to produce a very elegant consumer experience? And as you look at all of the other approaches to scaling which have merits, they just like keep increasing social complexity of the system as a whole. And that's always struck me as like a pretty big bottleneck to overall rate of innovation, because again, the more parties need to coordinate on more stuff inherently, overall innovation must slow down to deal with that.
00:08:06.944 - 00:08:10.944, Speaker B: And I've always loved the beauty of the Solana approach for that reason.
00:08:11.524 - 00:08:20.476, Speaker A: Let's switch gears for a second and talk about Twitter. Maddie, Sino, over here, I think you're probably everyone's favorite on the stage. No offense to the rest of us.
00:08:20.540 - 00:08:22.852, Speaker C: Probably a little polarizing, but go ahead.
00:08:22.908 - 00:08:41.894, Speaker A: Polarizing, that's okay. We like a little polarizing. Let's talk about perceptions, how VC's are positioning themselves from public perception point of view. What's this, what is your approach to that and how do you think that's changed, if at all, in this market?
00:08:42.014 - 00:08:42.270, Speaker E: Sure.
00:08:42.302 - 00:09:26.454, Speaker C: So I'm not necessarily sure my approach would be the recommended approach, other than to say that I think the most important part is that it's super important to come across as authentic and genuine. That for sure. And then I think that I would add to the fact that in tradfi, it's okay to be a little standoffish, it's okay to be above the fray, and you can really get away with that as a VC and probably viewed positively, frankly. But I think most elements of crypto are far more social. And so to the extent that that works for you, it probably makes sense to lean into that. But again, you know, you really just have to start with being genuine and authentic. So I would phrase in that way.
00:09:27.794 - 00:09:32.106, Speaker A: The approach doesn't change at all, regardless of the markets. Just make sure that, oh, no, I'm.
00:09:32.130 - 00:10:07.270, Speaker C: Not sure why that would be. It's not obvious to me why if a person is trying to be genuine and authentic, that it would change regardless of market conditions. I mean, look, you know, crypto, Twitter is euphoric one day and despondent the next day. We take a long term view. So our way of engaging with the industry is not super going to change day to day. I think you got to kind of just be accessible, be genuine, be pro social, and then just kind of vibe in a way that makes sense to yourself and your team. And it's authentic.
00:10:07.462 - 00:10:33.588, Speaker A: And for a long term view, I mean, in crypto, I've been in crypto, let's see, three years at coindesk, five or six, just playing around in different forms. We've all been around for a while now. But a year is a long time in crypto. So in the long term. One year ago, Amy, did you think that the market would be where it is? Like, what was your outlook then for where we would be today? One year ago?
00:10:33.716 - 00:10:43.524, Speaker D: A year ago was, I mean, it was like peak bull market. I mean, it felt like it was peak bull market, to be honest.
00:10:43.644 - 00:10:44.668, Speaker A: What were the signs?
00:10:44.756 - 00:10:45.584, Speaker D: All of it?
00:10:46.044 - 00:10:54.464, Speaker A: Was it the people on the subway? You would hear, oh, you know, I'm buying doge, or like, what would you say it was? People market? How did that make?
00:10:54.504 - 00:12:05.000, Speaker D: Well, from a venture investor perspective there, I think it was like we were just starting to do deals where the valuation did not make sense and then the kind of lack of diligence and didn't make sense. And it was, there was, it's always impossible to, to predict timing. So I don't think anyone predicted necessarily, like, the timing of the bear market. Just like no one can predict the next, even, like, microcycle, but, like, the next bull market, although probably pretty tied to macro markets these days. But I think, yeah, like, when you get that feeling of this doesn't feel, this feels a little, like, reckless in terms of how rounds are getting done and what people were saying. That's when I think, like, people who have been through multiple cycles usually start getting a little bit more conservative and start pulling back capital deployment, as some voices in the room were. It was interesting because, I mean, we really have been in a multi year bull cycle, even outside of crypto, and in a world in which most entrepreneurs in this vintage, and actually also investors, haven't actually been through a bear cycle.
00:12:05.000 - 00:12:46.946, Speaker D: I was at Lightspeed when we went through the beginning of. At the beginning of COVID there was maybe like a quarter, like a month of when everything kind of froze from a capital deployment perspective. And a lot of people at that point thought that maybe that was the beginning, and that was clearly not true. And perhaps we're in, like, a much longer bear cycle right now. So it's. Yeah, the timing is impossible to predict, but I would say usually when you're like, people are really kind of pulling back significantly is when you're like, okay, we're well into this cycle. And then, although the difference this time is that, so venture capital really kind of exists in decade long cycles, like fun cycles.
00:12:46.946 - 00:13:18.284, Speaker D: And so there has been tens of billions of dollars, like, raised, like, hundreds of billions, actually. And so this jar powder is very much sitting on the side, which is why I think a lot of people still observe, even though deployment has slowed down. Like valuations for a lot of, some of the top teams have really are still remains like fairly high. And to be honest, I don't think that's going to change because people funds are still sitting on billions of dollars of capital. So it's different environment than certainly the last bear.
00:13:18.824 - 00:13:29.544, Speaker A: When you say that it's still fairly high, do you think that the valuations still have room to come down or do you think that these levels will be maintained or should they be maintained?
00:13:30.044 - 00:13:37.092, Speaker D: I mean, like $100 million valuation for a seed round, pre product, pre monetization, like, doesn't really make sense to me. Is that really venture investor, is that.
00:13:37.108 - 00:13:39.004, Speaker A: A common sight or. It's not uncommon.
00:13:39.044 - 00:13:47.988, Speaker D: That was very common as of a year ago. Very common. In fact, probably like average. I would say, like now it's not. But there's still, you know, teams out there kind of anchored at around there.
00:13:48.076 - 00:14:04.026, Speaker A: I wonder how those, you know, let's say ten 100 million dollar seed rounds. How many, where are they now? We need to have like a reunion show and find out where their valuations are one year ago later, I'd say.
00:14:04.210 - 00:14:19.654, Speaker B: Median seed is like 20 if I were to guess right now. But there's a lot of stuff being done in the twelve to 15 range. A lot of stuff being done 25 to 30 depending on the experience of the entrepreneur and size of the market and stuff. The 20 is probably a rough median.
00:14:20.044 - 00:14:33.504, Speaker A: And min. Do the types of products and teams that pop up change relative to the market? Are we seeing different sorts of pitches now because of where the market is?
00:14:33.884 - 00:15:20.636, Speaker E: Yeah, I think we kind of think about things like bear and bull cycles as being everything's a rates game and especially right now, like with the macro backdrop, sure. Defi tokens are down 90%. So are a lot of stocks. So I think with that in mind, like the shape of this bear market is quite different from the last one. You know, one thing that's really interesting is just the entrance of like talented engineers and founders from web two to web3. I think particularly after this week, as we saw a lot of big tech, like, you know, make layoffs of more than 10% of the companies, a fair amount of those are going to come to crypto. We certainly haven't seen the stop of just more talented founders.
00:15:20.636 - 00:16:12.314, Speaker E: Think about what they can build in crypto that they can't actually do in web two. So that's one thing that's quite encouraging. I think in general, in bull markets we see a lot of experimentation. So a lot of, hey, this Ponz genomics game will absolutely work one day and generally they don't really, but we go along with it because there's a lot of irrational exuberance in bear markets. I think teams tend to take more of a disciplined approach with their dry powder, with light Runway, a lot more focus on proof points and near term adoption. We're also seeing a lot more equity rounds relative to, say, six to nine months ago. And people are really starting to think like, okay, if I need a token, what do I need a token for? But I do like, you know, emphasize that there's certainly a lot of vc money out there.
00:16:12.314 - 00:16:55.384, Speaker E: So we're still seeing things get funded, we're still deploying as well. I do think like, you know, strong teams can certainly get high valuations and it's a matter of what you're going for as a founder, like, because if I look at like some of the l one comps, they're still trading above a billion. So some investors gonna choose like, hey, the seed round at 100 million looks totally reasonable to me. I can underwrite this. Whereas I probably share Kyle's approach where I like it to come a little bit lower just to give us a bit more buffer and the founders as well. So founders, I think, still have some choice in terms of who they want to partner with. And that's the beauty of building in web3 versus in web two, where I think people are hit a lot more harder as a lot of fintech and e commerce.
00:16:55.384 - 00:16:59.364, Speaker E: That's a lot more impacted than the macro than say, we are.
00:17:00.214 - 00:17:27.744, Speaker A: Kyle, is there a difference from one market cycle to the next in VC's preference for a token or equity? I think that a year ago everyone definitely wanted tokens. I don't know if that's quite the case now, but just from a allocation of the investment structure, is there a shift from token or equity or saft or however you want to call it?
00:17:28.044 - 00:18:08.980, Speaker B: I've heard people wanting to do more equity recently. I don't fully get why not multicoin? What we have told our LP's and what we are doing is we are a token first fund. And so I think at our venture fund two, we probably 90% ish token focused investments, or at least 90% in terms of dollars. I think venture fund three, which we're currently investing out of, probably is on pace for 90%. So that's what we've told our LP's. That's been true and I think will remain true. I think the reason for that is we believe our core alpha is investing in token systems, that's where we play, and that's where I want my own money in the fund, and that's what we've told our LP's.
00:18:08.980 - 00:18:30.418, Speaker B: So like whether prices sold us 30 or 200, that shouldn't change mechanically. The way that most token deals are done is they're done as either a safe or as a priced equity round with a token warrant. So there's legal mechanics of the deal, but we consider all of those token deals because the way we expect to make money is via tokens.
00:18:30.546 - 00:18:39.834, Speaker A: So regardless of whether they're issuing the tokens to you at the time, you want to make sure that your exposure to the project is in token form.
00:18:39.954 - 00:18:57.724, Speaker B: Correct. There was a time when saps were fairly common, back in 2018 and 19. That's mostly stopped as an instrument. I don't fully appreciate all the legal reasons why our legal team and GC can explain all of that, but it's now, I'd say, standard. That's like equity with a token warrant.
00:18:58.544 - 00:19:05.804, Speaker A: Let's just go down the line. Matthew, do you have a preference, token versus equity? And if you do, has that changed?
00:19:06.904 - 00:19:37.738, Speaker C: The first part is it has not changed. I would echo what has said about it seems empirically in the market there's a little bit of a shift towards more equity. Our preference has not changed. It's not obvious to me why it would. We are. It's my view that certain types of businesses are best suited to equity. Certain types of businesses, rather, are best suited to token models, and many types of businesses are best suited to hybrid models.
00:19:37.738 - 00:20:13.168, Speaker C: And so really, when we evaluate a deal, we want to know where is the value actually going to accrue. Many times it's tokens. Often, though, as was the case with winter, mute, it's equity. So it really depends on what kind of business we're talking about. And then it's a case of evaluating. Ultimately, really, we're trying to say where's the value going to accrue? And so we assess in that way. But what is so special about our industry is that having token models, including using it as part of a hybrid structure, really opens up all kinds of novel mechanisms.
00:20:13.168 - 00:20:16.496, Speaker C: And so it's really important to always keep that in mind.
00:20:16.680 - 00:20:22.164, Speaker A: And Amy, what about you? What about FTX ventures? Is there a preference for token or equity?
00:20:23.024 - 00:21:05.576, Speaker D: This is more of a personal preference. I completely agree with the comments. I've been a traditional venture investor for, at this point almost a decade, and so I am actually most familiar with equity. And so therefore, I think from the beginning of the year, when we launched FTX Ventures, I had always oriented around this equity plus token warrant structure anyway. I think it's become more in vogue. I think historically, I think crypto native investors are very comfortable with investing tokens, and they also have the most alpha coming in and out of that. As the lockup periods get longer, though, it's harder to, I think because tokens are a lot more volatile in pricing.
00:21:05.576 - 00:21:34.490, Speaker D: And so it becomes harder, I think, for a fund manager to kind of manage that liquidity and so on. But on the equity side, especially since so many companies that I had previously invested in ultimately found an exit actually in acquisition. And so I think there's still some complexities when there's a token involved there. We've actually experienced that on the FTX side as well, on the m and a side. And so, yeah, I've always invested in both.
00:21:34.682 - 00:22:05.158, Speaker A: And let's talk about up and coming ecosystems. We're seeing a lot of pressure on the developer side from Apdos is really reaching out to a lot of Solana developers. It's saying, come here, play around with us, see what you can do. And I'm wondering if from. For me, it's very interesting that app, this is happening in the market, that it is, because the tap is blown off. Like I said, we're in a different world. It's a little harder to build in this one.
00:22:05.158 - 00:22:24.054, Speaker A: I don't know if it's having any impact on their outreach. I'm wondering if it's having any impact on your guys approach to up and coming ecosystems specifically for Aptos, because it's one that is more. There's a bit more tension, I guess you could say, between those two worlds. Amy, we'll start with you.
00:22:25.554 - 00:22:27.334, Speaker D: I mean, do it.
00:22:27.834 - 00:22:55.774, Speaker B: I guess I'll take it. Yeah, it's interesting, right? So when Solana launched, Ethereum was like kind of sort of 100% market share of people building things. No one really builds things in bitcoin. And there was a pretty strongly held view that Ethereum had won. That was it. And obviously no one really thinks that anymore. And so the world's eyes are much more open to a multichain thing.
00:22:55.774 - 00:23:20.374, Speaker B: So it's kind of like the most important meta comment. And then the second is probably that, like some of the early Ethereum, people got fairly wealthy fairly quickly. The earliest, a lot of people got really wealthy even more quickly. And then there's a lot of people who, like, we're just like six to nine months too late to Solana and like, didn't experience the same degree of wealth creation. And a lot of those guys were like, okay, well, like, if Aptos is next. Solana. Right? Like, you just kind of naturally see that happen.
00:23:20.374 - 00:23:43.024, Speaker B: Kind of human greed dictates that will happen. So there's been a fair bit of that. I don't mean that to discredit the Aptos ecosystem. It's just like, you have to understand incentives. Incentives are everything, and there's obviously a fair bit of that at play. That's all fine and well for getting an ecosystem off the ground. Those people are building, like, useful primitives and protocols and, like, there's a lot of just, like, boring stuff you have to build to make an ecosystem function.
00:23:43.024 - 00:23:52.564, Speaker B: And, like, that's being built so good for the Atlas ecosystem. And doing that and launching with a pretty strong amount of momentum. And, yeah, they're coming out of the gate, moving very fast.
00:23:53.944 - 00:24:48.364, Speaker D: A comment maybe on just cross chain is that we, you know, on the FTX side, we are cross chain. You know, we have integrated with over a dozen blockchains at this point and continue to. We constantly look for blockchains that differentiate from an architectural perspective and suitable for different use cases, which kind of led us to, for example, investing in celestia, in the cosmos ecosystem, and then Sui as well, that actually there is a future potential cross chain world in which, again, different use cases are actually in the Sui case, for example, kind of like non parallelized transactions. That is interesting. And because the infrastructure layer is still pretty early, I would say right now, it's an interesting design space for a lot of developers, and we want to support that innovation. So that has led us to investing.
00:24:48.984 - 00:25:31.674, Speaker A: In multiple ecosystems and a cross chain world. A cross chain world is only going to work if we have systems strong enough that North Korea. Korea can't break into them. Are the VC's, are you guys investing enough in the security of these bridges and these primitives that move across different ecosystems? I think the answer, not my thought on the matter, is probably no, not specifically any one of you. But we keep seeing hacks all the time. It's clear to me that something has to change, because the promise of moving assets to different ecosystems won't work if you can just mint to infinity whenever it gets hacked. Matthew, we'll start with you.
00:25:31.834 - 00:25:32.154, Speaker B: Sure.
00:25:32.194 - 00:26:32.294, Speaker C: I would say, empirically we can pretty much assess that not enough time and attention and money is being spent on security across our industry. I think it is a very difficult balancing of incentives, especially in this industry, that leads to that outcome. Although we can certainly see that in traditional technology, the security budget is probably much less than what it would optimally be. I would say that certainly we have a strong bias towards trying to suss out what teams take security more seriously rather than less, and trying to encourage our portfolio companies and projects to prioritize a security first approach. But you know, again, ultimately this is an incentive issue and I think there are very powerful reasons why we're not quite landing on the sweet spot. I hope that changes, but it's quite a complex problem in practice.
00:26:33.034 - 00:26:35.362, Speaker A: And min, what's your thoughts on the matter?
00:26:35.538 - 00:27:49.710, Speaker E: Yeah, I think, you know, when we sort of look at the last twelve months, there are a lot of important and expensive lessons. But you know, with bridge, I think it was a unique point of time where because of like sort of liquidity mining there a lot of bridges were forced to sort of manage the bridging, the infra, the BD, be the first on a new chain to make sure they got the liquidity mining and move tokens across. And when we take a step back, like that's probably not steady state. What we need, like we need more like, you know, roll up to roll up communications, like different sort of state verifications as opposed to only token based bridging use cases. So I do think the requirements are evolving and a lot of good bridging teams are thinking about that specifically as we move more towards a roll up world. And it's pretty cool with the modularity being a sign of technical maturity, but definitely a meme that was popularized by Celestia, where we can see developers sort of pick and mix between the consensus and settlement and execution layers, and see different sort of vms work with different roll ups. We're pretty excited to see all the infra middleware built around that.
00:27:49.710 - 00:27:58.942, Speaker E: And we have a portfolio company Eigen layer that's actually bootstrapping a lot of this new middleware to try and get developers to inspect the space a bit more.
00:27:59.078 - 00:28:12.090, Speaker A: All right, so we've got two minutes left. We're going to try to speed round tackle the question that's on everyone's mind. How much longer are we going to be in this bear market? Keep the 30 seconds, you don't need to give it exact time. We'll take it down to the minute.
00:28:12.242 - 00:28:17.698, Speaker D: I think it's pretty tied to macro cycles. So my guess is probably a couple of years.
00:28:17.786 - 00:28:21.578, Speaker B: Couple of years, no real opinion? Not my cup of tea.
00:28:21.626 - 00:28:23.826, Speaker A: Not your cup of tea. Well, what is your cup of tea then?
00:28:24.010 - 00:28:26.370, Speaker B: Finding amazing entrepreneurs and helping them win.
00:28:26.562 - 00:28:29.186, Speaker A: And that's going to continue no matter what market you're in.
00:28:29.250 - 00:28:30.938, Speaker B: That's all I do all day, every day.
00:28:31.066 - 00:28:35.186, Speaker A: All right, that's a little shorter than 30 seconds, but we'll take it. Matthew. Yeah.
00:28:35.210 - 00:28:54.012, Speaker C: I mean, I'm not sure this is a super predictable thing, but I do take the bear market best market approach, and I fundamentally believe that bear markets are where you make your money. It's bull markets later when you find out how much money you made. But look, we took a countercyclical approach. This is a great time for us. We'll have fun later. We'll get there.
00:28:54.148 - 00:28:58.304, Speaker A: So this is an exciting time. You've bundled up and you're ready to go.
00:28:59.004 - 00:29:17.096, Speaker C: The serious people are still here, right? The larpers are gone. I'm okay with that. You know, they'll come back later. We got time. This is a long term. This is, in my view, this is the biggest technological change since the Internet, at least from an american perspective. And I think we're more towards the front end of that than the back end.
00:29:17.096 - 00:29:24.800, Speaker C: So people come and go and the number of serious people will grow year after year. Seems like healthy, frankly.
00:29:24.912 - 00:29:31.208, Speaker A: The Larpers will return, but not quite yet. And minus out. What's your predictions for the, the time ahead?
00:29:31.336 - 00:29:48.040, Speaker E: I started my career in the start of the last financial crisis. I certainly hope this one doesn't last too long. But I think our base case is we start peeking out of a trough in early 2024. You know, as Matthew said, lots more left to be built. So we'll be keeping busy until then.
00:29:48.152 - 00:29:55.256, Speaker A: Great. Well, thank you all for joining me. This has been a fascinating talk about where we stand, so thank you.
00:29:55.360 - 00:29:56.204, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:29:56.504 - 00:29:57.064, Speaker B: Thanks, Annie.
