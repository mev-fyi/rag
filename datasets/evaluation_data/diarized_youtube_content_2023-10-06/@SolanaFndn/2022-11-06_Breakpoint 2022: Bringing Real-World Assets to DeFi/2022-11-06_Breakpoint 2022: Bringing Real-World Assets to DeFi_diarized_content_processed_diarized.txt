00:00:03.600 - 00:00:35.734, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. We've got a ton to cover in this session and a short time to do it, so I'm going to keep this pretty quick. I'm Samantha Bobot. I'm with digital currency Group. We're an investor in more than 200 projects in over 35 countries. Increasingly, several of them touch real world assets or are developing the tooling that we believe is critical to allow for a greater variety of assets and users to be involved in on chain transactions. So I feel super privileged to be joined by this panel that brings a lot of diverse perspective and are all building on Solana.
00:00:35.734 - 00:00:50.174, Speaker A: We have Ben, who's with Solana Labs. Mary is with Bridgesplit, Thomas is with projects finance, and Trevor is with Parcel. I'm going to turn it over to them to introduce themselves and their work. Ben, should we kick off with you?
00:00:50.474 - 00:01:04.344, Speaker B: Hi, guys, I'm Ben Sprengo. I am the head of BD at Solana Labs. Focus kind of broadly across all of the BD verticals that we care about, primarily on Defi and growing financial use cases on Solana.
00:01:04.764 - 00:01:26.144, Speaker C: Hi, everyone, my name is Mary. I'm one of the co founders of Bridgesplit and we are tokenization infrastructure on Solana. So focused on the pooling, tranching elements of assets, so after they're on chain, they're investable. We started with digital assets and now have been expanding to support a variety of assets, including off chain real world assets.
00:01:27.644 - 00:02:01.424, Speaker D: All right, great. Hi everybody, I'm Thomas, co founder and CEO at Credx Finance. We have built an institutional DeFi platform that allows investors to invest in real world assets. The real world assets that we tokenize on our platform are car loans, SME loans, focused on the emerging markets. We work locally with a set of fintech lenders and underwriters that originate, tokenize and securitize these assets, and then we can distribute it through the Credx platform.
00:02:02.244 - 00:02:29.324, Speaker E: Hi, everyone. Thanks for being here. I'm Trevor Bacon, the co founder and CEO of Parcel. Parcel is a synthetic realist derivatives, synthetic real estate derivatives platform based on Solana. We have price feeds that mimic the price per square foot of any given city or neighborhood that pipes in through an oracle onto the Solana blockchain or smart contracts allow you to get levered long or short, any geographical market.
00:02:29.824 - 00:02:45.704, Speaker A: Thank you. I know we want to turn to kind of developments in this area, the opportunities, the things that are exciting us. But it feels like we need to set the stage a little about the definition. What do we talk about when we're saying real world assets. What are each of you thinking about and how do you define it?
00:02:46.324 - 00:03:14.834, Speaker B: Yeah, so when I think about real world assets, I'm thinking about primarily off chain assets. I feel like that's the more apt term. Things that either you're tokenizing on chain could be a house, a car loan, a debt instrument, something like that. I think it encompasses a lot of different assets, and it's really, really ill defined currently, but we're taking the right steps to define that, especially with these conversations here today.
00:03:15.214 - 00:03:56.914, Speaker C: Yeah, similar idea. It's kind of a very broad term and encompasses all value that sits off chain, which is most of the value. But I think there's been this interesting introduction of the idea of birth assets and rebirth assets. So assets you're actually bridging on chain that have off chain value and new assets you're creating on chain. And I actually think regardless of whether they're on chain or off chain, a lot of the infrastructure actually kind of remains consistent throughout. And so something that we're thinking about at Bridgelet is the idea of nfts and representing unique value, whether that's digital value or unique off chain value, as this same kind of tokenized standard on the blockchain.
00:03:57.974 - 00:04:33.914, Speaker D: Yeah, and maybe doubling down on that. We believe something very similar at Credx and what we believe is one of the issues and challenges of having an off chain asset and an on chain asset. How do you link the legal infrastructure, the compliance infrastructure? So if I own a token, and the token represents a car or a productive cash flow generating assets, how when I transfer the token, you also transfer the legal recourse of that actual asset. And that are the kind of issues and challenges that platforms like ourselves are trying to solve.
00:04:35.214 - 00:05:04.934, Speaker E: So that's a great segue. So we do believe that a lot of the infrastructure in time will be on chain, such as, especially for real estate. So real estate is effectively the biggest market in the world. It is also amongst the most complex and least transparent. And so in order to bring that on chain, you need a large stack. So you need mortgages, deeds, titles, loans, obviously, and appraisals. So that's a pretty comprehensive stack that will take time to develop.
00:05:04.934 - 00:05:40.136, Speaker E: We're coming from a different lens, which is taking a top down index approach for pricing. So we'll have pricing and then eventually we can have pricing for individual assets. And we think that's a segue to allow the stack to evolve and mature. So we can be the appraisal layer. You can get a loan on appraisal, then hopefully someone comes along and creates the deed and title, and then we can have a full housing stack on chain, and then you have the pricing layer to trade. That's really what you're missing in a lot of the when you put assets on chain, how do you price them and trade them in a fluid manner?
00:05:40.320 - 00:06:05.140, Speaker A: So a couple of you alluded to some of the challenges right now around KYC and what things like on chain credentials can open up. Obviously, the legal, the structuring, the enforcement, I guess maybe, Mary, because you're dealing the most in kind of on chain native assets right now. How do you think about what assets are most ripe to be brought on chain and kind of which are not or which are further out?
00:06:05.292 - 00:07:06.584, Speaker C: Yeah. So thinking about the challenges broadly in working with real world assets, I think it kind of boils down to the three major elements of it. One is the legal element, is how hard is it to actually represent that asset on chain in a way that's enforceable via smart contracts? There's also the element of capital. How do you bring in a sufficient amount of capital to actually finance that asset class? And then also with asset originators, as people are bringing assets on chain, how do you convince them to take the inherent risks with working with the new technology, with working with blockchain to kind of deliver on that value for their specific asset? And so how we think about it is, so we started with digital assets. So we brought our product to things like NFT LP positions, to gaming assets, to NFT jpegs, and built that same infrastructure on there, because all of that is enforceable via smart contract. You're not relying on that legal element at all. It's mostly retail focused.
00:07:06.584 - 00:07:33.804, Speaker C: And now, as we kind of move down the spectrum, I think there's a couple things we're thinking about. I think real estate is an interesting challenge because it's like this spectrum of physical custody versus digital custody, and it's on this far end of physical custody. And then also how complex an asset is, whether it's debt and something kind of more investable versus something that's a little bit more complex and requires pricing feeds and stuff and working with folks on real estate.
00:07:35.144 - 00:07:42.004, Speaker A: Thomas, what is the main benefit to fintech companies or other borrowers for you that are issuing debt on chain?
00:07:42.424 - 00:09:07.214, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it comes back to what we see as the challenges of the market. And when we looked at real world assets, one of the big challenges is you now have to convince investors to provide liquidity on a blockchain based platform to invest in assets that they might also be able to do in a more traditional finance kind of way. At the same time, you have borrowers or asset originators that now have to learn how to work with new technology and bring the assets on chain. What we believed with Credx, where we would have the most impact and where the first assets would make sense to common chain, is where it is really hard today to get access to finance, where it's very hard to invest in these kind of assets, and where there is a lack of transparency and there is zero to non infrastructure. That's why we chose private credit emerging markets as a first opportunity, a very hard to invest asset class with a lack of data standardization and transparency, cross border settlement issues, and all of that. By tokenizing it and securitizing it and packaging it in a standardized way, we're solving for that problem, creating cost efficiencies, but also just access to liquidity.
00:09:07.534 - 00:09:28.554, Speaker A: Trevor, when you kicked off, you said derivatives, synthetics, synthetics, derivatives. For some of us it sounds like a mouthful. What it doesn't sound like is fractionalization or tokenization, which a lot of us have heard in the same breath with real estate over the years. Why have you structured it this way? How do you feel? This is the first step in addressing the problem.
00:09:29.374 - 00:10:25.346, Speaker E: So, fractionalization and tokenization, in short, just for the audience, is when you buy a property and you slide, slice the equity up, and you can either sell it through a vehicle that say like a private vehicle, or more recently, you have tradable platforms that have the equity as shares or tokens. And that model is somewhat compelling, but it lacks scale, because you need time and capital to actually bring the assets on chain. So it's difficult to have a robust trade trading market around those instruments. So we believe that DeFi offers an opportunity for people to get access to real estate price movements. So we're allowing people to get long or short various markets. For example, half the reason why we started this was I was a hedge fund portfolio manager, and I wanted to go long Miami and short New York. And it was, there was no instrument to do that.
00:10:25.346 - 00:10:56.412, Speaker E: And so this is the route that we took to start scalables in, such that the smart contracts can hold the dollars to provide the liquidity and we provide the price, the reference price to trade over time. We think that if we have a robust and trusted infrastructure to price, we can bring physical assets on chain in the future again, once we have the stack that is needed to actually have a full real world House on the.
00:10:56.428 - 00:11:10.852, Speaker A: Blockchain feels like a perfect setup to how ready is the tech layer today? We've talked about other challenges, but is the tech ready for primetime? What can protocol teams do to support the key tooling? Ben, do you want to kick off?
00:11:11.028 - 00:12:11.588, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, I think fundamentally the tech is not ready today. There's still a lot that we need to build to make sure that we can maintain these assets on chain. One of the things that, from all the conversations that I have with that institutions, is just like an improvement on KYC infrastructure. There's a few different ways that people are taking shots at that. You have people like Verity from the center team and other people who are focused on verifiable credentials, which is basically a new layer of the web3 stack. You have some people trying to do credentials through NFTs, like soul bound NFTs or Kycto Dao, and then you have some other folks that are trying to do different ways of KYC without doing some sort of like on chain asset or credential. The folks at Cross river are doing some interesting stuff about simulating transactions before they're executed from their platform so they can simulate which addresses this transaction is going to touch.
00:12:11.588 - 00:12:31.214, Speaker B: And in the event that there's a non kyz person at one point, the transaction fails. So KYC infrastructure is something that's absolutely necessary for a lot of these assets, real estate, more securitized assets, to come on chain. People are making headway in that, but there's still a lot of work to be done there.
00:12:31.554 - 00:13:29.934, Speaker C: Yeah, in that same vein, I think there's just a lot of elements of the stack that still need to be specialized in. Makerdao pioneered a lot of the work in this space space, and they were forced to kind of own this full stack between asset origination, asset underwriting, bringing in the capital. And the reality is, like we said earlier, off chain assets is a huge space. And I think players now are starting to realize that it's more important to double down on very specific elements of the stack, especially as we think about how do we deliver the actual value of the blockchain to these end asset originators and institutions. Institutions who we are in the position to convince, to kind of come on chain and take this additional risk and to be able to specialize in those different parts of the stack. So it is actually a step function better than the alternative in traditional finance is something that we're constantly thinking about and kind of part of the reason we focus on a very specific asset agnostic element of the infrastructure.
00:13:32.854 - 00:13:52.902, Speaker A: Thomas, I guess you guys are underwriting a lot of the loans you're doing. KYC, there's an element, it's sort of a controlled environment, if you will. Where do you fall on sort of how decentralized this will be in time, and kind of what does it take to get institutions in without hand holding now?
00:13:52.958 - 00:14:52.296, Speaker D: Very good point. And so we, with critics from the beginning, we took the decision that we have to do things that don't scale, and we have to do the dirty work of bringing credit on chain to really understand which kind of product we had to build. And so when we went into this market, indeed, we said like, look, critics can act as an underwriter. We'll work with institutions to provide financing on this. We do everything permissions and Kyc'd in an environment that is legally compliant. And we work with certain centralized parties to provide a clear link between the off chain asset and the on chain asset. Now, of course, this is the beginning, because this allowed us to bring over $30 million worth of assets on chain, underwrite them, provide car loans and SME loans in Brazil through the Solana blockchain.
00:14:52.296 - 00:15:48.734, Speaker D: So that's live, that's happening now. Now, indeed. It's the next challenges. How do we further build the stack, the data standards, and how do we think about decentralization from there? Decentralization not for the sake of it, but for the sake to make it more scalable. How can we let other people underwrite on the platform, create incentivization mechanisms to do so? And what we believe is that most of the assets, the collateral, the management, the legal infrastructure, can come on chain, but there will always be a need for certain centralized institutions to take part in that. Should it be one big one to manage the whole infrastructure? Definitely not. Can it be a set of local underwriters, small investors, retail and institutions working in a decentralized way together? Yes, that's what we believe where this is going.
00:15:49.234 - 00:16:05.714, Speaker A: Trevor, I'd love you to weigh in on kind of how you see the user landscape evolving. Is it bringing investment opportunities to crypto native? Obviously, that's a very different prospect than bringing in newcomers who are familiar with a different asset and are doing it on chain for the first time. So how have you navigated that?
00:16:05.874 - 00:17:02.364, Speaker E: Yeah, so we, the initial user will be most likely a defi user, but we're really focused on simplifying the UI UX to broaden the use case to more, to a broader set of folks. And we have a great team that really focuses on that. User flows, user experience. We do believe that real estate is amongst the most familiar asset classes in the world. Every single person has a relationship with real estate, and what we're doing actually is not that complicated. Do you want to go long or short a geographical market and have exposure there? A lot of people don't have the opportunity to have access to real estate. There's a huge institutional flood of capital going into various markets, pricing out a lot of people access to credit on the low end as well as well as a lot.
00:17:02.364 - 00:17:18.983, Speaker E: A high barrier to entry if you wanted to get exposure in a different country, almost impossible. So we do believe this is a mass market product for the entire world, and we do believe that the blockchain rails are the most efficient way to deliver that.
00:17:20.043 - 00:17:38.804, Speaker A: I'd love for each of you to just talk through some milestones that are on the horizon. So this can be for your projects or kind of infrastructure that you're keeping an eye on. Obviously, it's a developer conference. We have builders here who might want to build the thing that helps you accelerate or scale faster. So kind of open canvas run with that.
00:17:39.224 - 00:17:41.904, Speaker B: Anybody want to go ahead?
00:17:41.944 - 00:17:43.816, Speaker E: Oh, you go.
00:17:44.000 - 00:17:45.884, Speaker B: No, you go now, please.
00:17:46.824 - 00:18:48.584, Speaker E: A few things with respect to building, I think the ecosystem has come a long, long way. We have oracles that run on a pith client, one way to make those more trusted or zero knowledge to technologies. We're in Mena's partner program to start, and eventually we want to have zero knowledge proofs or zero knowledge oracles so that they know, similar to credits, like we do have some elements of centralization, even though they're separate bodies or separate entities, the data has to come from somewhere. And the reason why we did that is because that's how it would take a very long time to actually innovate if everything was very decentralized. So ZK Oracles is something we're super excited about with respect to milestones. We launched a very successful gated v one alpha to our NFT holders. We had about 1000 people that were available to use the product and 500 of which converted into users, and that was unincentivized.
00:18:48.584 - 00:19:24.194, Speaker E: So we were very happy with that. About $250,000 traded hands in the couple weeks that we had it live. We have a fast follow, V two, which is substantially more capital efficient. You can get up to ten times mathematical leverage and provide earned yield as an APR, as an LP, and we have complete pace stability. So that will help the system with the integrity and trust. Look for that in the next couple of weeks. And we have a booth in the other venue to demonstrate?
00:19:25.974 - 00:19:26.806, Speaker A: Thomas.
00:19:26.950 - 00:20:04.208, Speaker D: Yeah. No. So I think for us, milestones, I think let's start with how we look at it from a pure credit perspective. So we just announced a $150 million deal that we are doing with a set of asset originators in Colombia and Mexico. So this is, for us, going to be really big. Launching in two new countries, providing a large scale ticket size of on chain financing towards SME's in these emerging countries. And it's all going to be backed by institutional investors.
00:20:04.208 - 00:21:04.064, Speaker D: And so that for us, 2023 is going to be really big for that. Today we have seen like KKR tokenizing a fund. We have seen Apollo doing some digital asset custody. We are now trying to talk to all these kind of institutions and bring them onto the Solana blockchain to invest in these kind of real world assets. So that's the company milestone that we have and that we're working on then. Secondly, as an industry, what we would like to see, and some of the very interesting conversations we have been having here with the companies on stage and companies that are here in the room is how do we not make the same mistakes as in Treadfi? So how do we not all start defining an asset differently? How do we create a more common data model across assets, across credits, across real world assets? So almost creating an industry body for real world assets to grow together and really push it into the market.
00:21:05.544 - 00:21:52.484, Speaker C: Yeah. So for Bridge split, like I mentioned earlier, some of the big milestones for us is the progress we've made on digital native assets. So we're currently doing $10 million in monthly volume across different digital assets and seeing about 1000 daily unique signers on that core protocol level. And later this month, we're going live with a few different customers in tradfi, tokenizing different assets from these Texas consumer loans to things like climate assets. And on that same vein, something that we are looking for actively is people who are really specialized in these assets and able to bring really high quality assets on chain and work with, on an infrastructure level with people who know that asset class and be a technology partner for those folks.
00:21:53.024 - 00:22:49.678, Speaker B: So I kind of approach this from a different perspective. These guys are all building products in the ecosystem. I kind of serve as the connective tissue for these guys. So my milestones are, if these guys succeed, but just to double down on something that Thomas said is you don't want to recreate the problems that we experienced in tradfi over the last 10, 15, 20 years. Something that I think is really important in that is this native cross margin that you can get on blockchains that you can't get in tradfi it like, impossible to track all of somebody's accounts and make sure that they have the proper collateral for something. And that's frankly what led to something like the mortgage backed security crisis. So you have like, you have things that are built on blockchains, like Credora, which is doing like active cross margin collateralization to show that like, okay, this guy actually has the money, or this guy just is ten x levered on AavE and he doesn't actually have that collateral.
00:22:49.678 - 00:22:56.824, Speaker B: So that's really what I'm excited about. Like those kinds of infrastructural things that are going to be contributive to what you guys are building.
00:22:58.484 - 00:23:17.064, Speaker A: I'm going to end with a fun lightning round. So, quick response, which of these three comes to pass first? An SEC approved Solana ETF, a major bank issuing a mortgage on chain, or let's say a Fortune 500 company doing a bond issuance on chain.
00:23:18.324 - 00:23:25.684, Speaker B: I will have to say Fortune 500 debt issuance on chain. I may or may not have information about that already being in the works.
00:23:26.624 - 00:23:29.204, Speaker C: I'd go with the bank issuing a mortgage on chain.
00:23:30.184 - 00:23:34.192, Speaker D: I'm going for the bondish ones on the Credx platform.
00:23:34.368 - 00:23:39.564, Speaker E: Oh, yes. I would have to hold it down for real estate and go with the mortgage on chain.
00:23:41.024 - 00:24:02.568, Speaker A: I guess I'll have to go with ETF to be contrarian. Thank you all so much for joining us and all of you for joining today. I know these speakers are going to be floating around, some of them in the developer studio. You can find their teams, you can play around with these platforms. Yeah. Exciting things ahead. Thank you all.
00:24:02.696 - 00:24:03.048, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:24:03.096 - 00:24:03.344, Speaker D: Thank you.
