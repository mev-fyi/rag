00:00:00.240 - 00:00:33.734, Speaker A: Have you ever looked at your previous transactions and couldn't remember what a transaction was for? Token extensions can fix this. The required memo on transfer token extension will enforce any transfers of that token to have a memo providing data on the transaction. These memos can be something like what you see in your bank account, things like getting gas or buying coffee. Tokens with this extension in the future will have similar memos on them, helping provide richer data on your transactions. Try out the required memo and transfer extension and other extensions today.
