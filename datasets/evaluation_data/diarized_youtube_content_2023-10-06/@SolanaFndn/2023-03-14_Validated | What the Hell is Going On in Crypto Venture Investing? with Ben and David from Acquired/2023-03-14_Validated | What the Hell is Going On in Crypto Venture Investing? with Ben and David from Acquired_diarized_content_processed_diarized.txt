00:00:08.119 - 00:00:42.004, Speaker A: I'm Austin, and this is validated. Today I'm speaking with Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal, hosts of Acquired, a podcast that tells the stories behind great companies. In addition to their work on acquired, both Ben and David have been professional venture capital investors in their past and current lives. Interviews with venture capitalists tend to be my least favorite type of interview. They tend to be navel, gazey, heavy on narrative spin, and light on substance. But this episode, and the one we did a few weeks before with Li Jin, tell a much more interesting story. If you work for a venture backed company even outside of web3, you'll want to stick around for this one.
00:00:42.004 - 00:01:28.254, Speaker A: In our initial preparation for this episode, I was expecting Ben and David to be much more bearish on blockchain, given the state of vc crypto investing. But once we got into this conversation, it became clear to me that Ben and David aren't actually bearish on the long term promise of blockchain. They argued that the current downturns in web3 venture investing shouldn't be perceived as a symptom unique to web3. As David puts it all a venture has gotten whacked through the lens of seasoned investors. Ben and David help us zoom out of the present moment of crypto investing. They help us make sense of how we got to where we are today, what's actually going on today, and the future conditions under which investing in crypto will become attractive again. Ben, David, welcome to validated.
00:01:28.254 - 00:01:30.014, Speaker A: Thank you for having us.
00:01:30.394 - 00:01:31.334, Speaker B: Jake's.
00:01:33.114 - 00:01:44.494, Speaker C: Austin. I gotta say, this is an amazing name for a crypto decentralized podcast. And I can't believe it wasn't taken completely, completely.
00:01:44.874 - 00:01:53.670, Speaker A: So I guess I wanted to kind of start off with, you guys have been running acquired for a while, and obviously you both are investors, both professionally and personally.
00:01:53.822 - 00:01:55.758, Speaker B: Quasi professionally in my case.
00:01:55.926 - 00:02:10.634, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I guess that's fair. But what was that journey like of seeing this technology wave, looking at it and going, I don't know yet, and then getting to a place where this became interesting to you?
00:02:11.534 - 00:02:50.954, Speaker C: Oh, I had, you know, I was. I did computer science undergrad, and my college years were 2008 to 2012. So I remember in the 2012 and 13 context, a bunch of people that I was in class with were doing some mining. I knew a bunch of people that lost money in Mount Gox. I followed it a little bit. It seemed super esoteric. Then there was the whole significant run up in the, what was it, 2017? Timeframe, and I felt like I missed it, but I followed it closely, and I don't think I certainly didn't grasp why Ethereum was different when that came out.
00:02:50.954 - 00:03:04.734, Speaker C: At the time, I was like, okay, another crypto thing. It's like another bitcoin. But I wasn't at the level of familiarity, of understanding. Oh, this is a decentralized world computer, which is different than a store of value and potential transaction layer.
00:03:05.154 - 00:03:41.680, Speaker B: Remembering back on this, my introduction and experience of crypto was different. I'm pretty sure it all came from Fred Wilson in Union Square Ventures and Fred's ABC blog. Which way? Way, way back in the day after college, I started my career in New York. I was an investment banker on Wall street at UBS, but I love tech. I was in the TMT group at UBS, and I always wanted to get into venture and tech. And so being in New York, I started reading Fred's blog. This is, you know, 2007, 2008 timeframe.
00:03:41.680 - 00:04:11.950, Speaker B: And then Fred really became one of the early investors, early VC's that was really interested in crypto and bitcoin at first, and then Ethereum, and they of course, did Coinbase and several others. So I was sort of following and thinking about all this from an investing lens, but mostly like a personal investing lens because it wasn't the sort of thing, certainly at that time, that Madrona, our old firm, would have invested in in the early 2010s.
00:04:12.142 - 00:04:37.734, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is something I'd love to chat a little bit about here, because it seemed like there was no interest on the venture capital side in crypto for years and years and years, and then one. Very few people different. Yeah, there were certainly a few, right. But it was very niche. It was sort of like the weird folks, the same way there's been space investing for a long time, but like, most VC's were like, oh, that's way far in the future. We're not interested in that kind of stuff.
00:04:37.734 - 00:04:52.982, Speaker A: There were a few visionaries who were earning to it, but there was a moment where all of these big VC's decided crypto was real and crypto was an investable asset class, and the projects here were interesting and ready to be built on. It felt from the outside like that.
00:04:52.998 - 00:04:56.558, Speaker C: Just happened overnight in the 2019 timeframe, right?
00:04:56.686 - 00:05:21.700, Speaker B: Well, I think there actually was a couple waves of it. I think what you guys are talking about did happen very suddenly in that sort of 2019 timeframe. But there were a couple of weeks, you know, that was, there was that early, you know, there was Fred Wilson. He had worked at us v and, um, was doing, uh, some crypto investing, too. So. So there were a very few, small number of VC's that were doing it. And then there was, uh.
00:05:21.700 - 00:05:50.436, Speaker B: I'm trying to remember when this was. This was after business school for me. So probably 2014, 2015, there was a wave of venture investing where the, you know, the hot one liner was, I don't believe in bitcoin, but I believe in the blockchain. Do you guys remember this? Like, it was the most VC. Stupid VC thing to say ever. And, like, there were a bunch of companies that got funded around that ripple being probably the most prominent among them and then others that have, I think, since completely disappeared.
00:05:50.580 - 00:06:14.496, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you see that there's sort of this, like, narrative that moves throughout, especially, like, the California VC firms. Like, we saw this in sort of 2016 around suddenly everyone was investing in niche markets, and this idea that we can take what was eBay, which was a service for everybody, we can bring that down to, like, eBay for dog toys, and suddenly that's an investable thesis in, like, 2016.
00:06:14.600 - 00:06:23.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Andrew Parker, also a USV alum, did a great. He did that seminal graphic of, like, taking the Craigslist homepage and, like, breaking apart each category, like.
00:06:24.112 - 00:06:46.314, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And, like, it felt like something similar kind of happened in. In crypto and web3. Sort of. Maybe this is more in that 2019 time range where something changed in the way that it was broadly seen. And to me, it didn't feel like a technology change as much as almost like a paradigm shift at the people who worked at some of these funds. Do you think that's accurate?
00:06:46.654 - 00:07:57.624, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's right. I think there's a slightly more charitable way to frame it where enough people figured out that Ethereum could create Dapps and that theoretically should have happened in 2017, but took a couple of years to really enter the zeitgeist. I think a lot of people who went from investing in crypto for speculation could sort of cross the chasm to, oh, I see, I can invest in these because they're going to make actual web apps in a decentralized manner that have different utility. I don't know what the utility is yet, necessarily, or I don't know why different is better, but I understand this is a new computing paradigm. And so then, even for the people who didn't really have a thesis around it yet, if they wanted to participate in the speculation that was going on, then at least there was a very plausible explanation for why, which is, God, we've been sitting on our hands for years and years and years. Since the iPhone, there hasn't been a new computing paradigm. Maybe this is the new computing paradigm, and there was, like a reasonable enough explanation as to how and why that would be the case.
00:07:57.784 - 00:08:42.248, Speaker B: There is certainly true to that. And that's the charitable explanation. I think they're also kind of austen, as you were implying, is a perhaps less charitable explanation, which is, if you think about the incentives of venture firms writ large, the industry writ large, not any specific firm, because they all are different. And some certainly don't do this. But the incentive is to raise more money, right, and raise more funds. And as Ben was saying, there was this period in the late 2000 and teens where it wasn't clear what the next platform was going to be, what the next investable opportunities were going to be. Now, in hindsight, things like SaaS were still very, very good investable opportunities.
00:08:42.248 - 00:08:43.324, Speaker B: Through all of that.
00:08:43.904 - 00:08:48.104, Speaker C: We didn't need another pc or Internet or mobile. There was plenty of growth in.
00:08:48.184 - 00:09:18.684, Speaker B: I think there was a lot hand wringing, though, in venture firms of, like, what are we going to invest in? And to raise more money, you have to invest the money you have, and then you have to present a compelling story to investors about what you're going to invest in. I think a lot of the boom that we saw and then things like dedicated crypto funds being raised across many different firms were about like, oh, great, we've got a new product that we can go raise a lot of money from and juice our Aum assets under management.
00:09:19.144 - 00:10:04.584, Speaker A: You're totally right that that was a time when the excitement in venture was very much shifting away from SaaS. But as we know, the venture firms that continued investing in SaaS, they've had some of the highest returns since that period of time. I mean, Zoom is even a great example of something like this, right? Different from a venture stage investment. But, you know, we have all these compliance companies that have popped up that are an area that I think most, and tax compliance companies, which is an area most people would think is not venture and incredibly boring. And there's already a market with accenture and all those guys. But, like, I think there's a very interesting parallel here to. It seems like sometimes when the public attention moves away, that's when the investment opportunities avail themselves to folks who are actually diligent and willing to stick around and do the work.
00:10:04.924 - 00:10:46.556, Speaker C: It's interesting. I think it is both the case that there were breakout SaaS companies to be had, and also SaaS was enormously crowded. And so when you're, you know, I do this for my day job. When you watch the 10th company come in and pitch you on workflow software to help the office of the x, be it legal or finance or you know, onboarding engineers or whatever. Like we pretty much know. If I tell you, hey, a SaaS app Todo X, you can basically sketch it out at this point because it's such a known frontier. You can literally visualize what the UI is supposed to do, how you would charge for it, what the user preferences panel would look like.
00:10:46.556 - 00:11:48.948, Speaker C: It's such a settled frontier. You see the 10th one of these pitch you and you're like God, I mean someone's going to win in this market, but it's all so mature and all the problems are so well understood that you are sort of pining for can't I just invest in something than Greenfield where they're the only company doing that, or at least will be for six to twelve months because it gives you a shot at having a quick breakout company. And if you're really, really lucky, then you're right at predicting the next paradigm. And then you get to be one of those investors that was involved with the next hundred billion dollar company who sort of saw the future before anybody else. And there's almost no chance of doing that. If you are investing in trying to find the top 1% companies of the last wave, you're just going to be like okay, great, you managed to three, four, maybe even five x your fund. Most people haven't even heard of the companies in your fund and there's very little to hang your hat on unless it's with lP's who literally know your returns.
00:11:49.076 - 00:11:55.904, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's such an interesting idea that three or five xing a fund in three to five years isn't something you can hang your hat on.
00:11:57.004 - 00:12:02.464, Speaker B: Well, it very much is in the right. A funny time recently.
00:12:03.274 - 00:12:27.014, Speaker A: Yes, that's fair. So when you guys look around the space now, right. I don't know how much investment you or funds you are affiliated with have actually made into web3, but there's been a drawdown in venture across the board. But I think at least the public perception is that web3 has been hit particularly hard by that drawdown. What are you sort of seeing today and how are you thinking about that landscape changing for venture in web3?
00:12:27.594 - 00:13:13.456, Speaker C: Well, I think the reason this landscape has changed so much is I was trying to come up with a good thesis for this ahead of our episode, and especially a lot of my peers who were really excited about web3 are suddenly not active. Okay, what's going on there? I think the biggest thing to look at is when the macro changed. When you have interest rates that go up, there are a lot of very low risk investment opportunities that have great returns. Like yesterday, I went and bought a twelve month CD for a guaranteed 5%. It is the weirdest thing. Two years ago, three years ago, I never thought that I would be on a podcast talking about how cool.
00:13:13.520 - 00:13:20.248, Speaker B: I mean, 18 months ago, I don't think you were even getting that yield staking, at least on Coinbase, right?
00:13:20.296 - 00:13:23.720, Speaker A: I mean, I know people who have mortgage rates that are half of that.
00:13:23.872 - 00:14:38.438, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So we're in this world where we have shifted from an abundance of capital. Capital is free. I can go and get more of it whenever I want to fund something that is potentially high risk, potentially speculative, to all of that capital has very good opportunities for it to be invested elsewhere with very low risk. And so what it does is if you imagine this sort of curve where you have the highest risk assets way out on the right side of the curve, on the x axis, and the lowest risk stuff on the left side, everyone who was sort of not finding any attractive investment opportunities anywhere on the left side of the curve was forced to look to the right. And so now what you basically are seeing is the only people who are way out on the risk curve are people that have extreme conviction that they see a future that other people don't. And all the tourists, everyone who was sort of over there, because there was no interesting investment opportunities in regular high risk startups or in public companies, or they just couldn't invest in any of these categories because the multiples were so high.
00:14:38.438 - 00:15:55.700, Speaker C: Like the asset inflation had just gotten so high that you have to chase risk in order to find any return, and now you don't have to chase risk to find return. And so the way I would sort of articulate what is happening is the bitcoin whitepaper was published in 2009. The idea of a decentralized computer first became real in 2015 to 16. We got great things like Solana that are fast, efficient, decentralized computers in the sort of late 2019, early 2020 timeframe. And so, depending on where you start the clock, if you say that we've had 14 years, or you say that we've had seven years, there was sort of this window to find the super high utility use cases for this new technology, while the capital was cheap or free, when there was tons of capital looking for or willing to flood into high risk in order to seek return. And now what we're seeing is, okay, well, we're not going to get a lot more capital. So we, as a we crypto, need to find and prove the sort of underwritable high utility, real intrinsic value, things with the capital that we've got, because everyone's not as incentivized to throw it here anymore.
00:15:55.892 - 00:16:28.254, Speaker A: That makes perfect sense. At the same time, you could very much argue that all we've done is shift the units on the scale five points to the right, and that this is the argument people make about inflation, is that everything has gotten more expensive by proportionally the same amount. And that's why we run into issues with inflation. But also, at the same time, that 5% yield you're getting is still effectively a 0% yield. If we have 5% inflation, why is that not the case in the risk reward people are thinking about in venture?
00:16:28.634 - 00:17:02.298, Speaker B: I think it is, and I was going to say that the perception is that web3 has been hit hardest out of all venture. I think that probably is technically true. I wouldn't necessarily argue with that. But I think it's easy being so deep and myopic in venture and in web3 to focus on that. But the reality is all of venture has gotten whacked. The difference between how much web3 within venture writ large has gotten whacked versus how much venture as a whole.
00:17:02.466 - 00:17:04.282, Speaker C: David, I totally, totally disagree. It's.
00:17:04.338 - 00:17:05.254, Speaker B: Totally disagree.
00:17:05.594 - 00:17:08.042, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, here we go.
00:17:08.098 - 00:17:08.922, Speaker A: This is why we're here.
00:17:08.978 - 00:17:25.754, Speaker C: Pre seed rounds now are something like, of regular non crypto companies are something like 6 million pre. And in the craziness, you got up to a world where, like, companies were coming out of YC and doing like 18 million pre, effectively, I was seeing.
00:17:25.794 - 00:17:27.666, Speaker B: Companies at 40 pre 50.
00:17:27.850 - 00:17:54.054, Speaker C: But crypto companies I was seeing at 50 or 100, and, like, the hottest ones were at like 150 pre product. So even from a relative starting position of being the most expensive thing to invest in, even if it just collapsed down to regular levels now, like, I'm not seeing a premium for crypto companies. I think they're raising pre seeds at the same prices that everyone else is raising pre seeds. You know, just based on their starting position alone, they got hit the hardest.
00:17:54.134 - 00:18:31.710, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not saying anything that different. Like, I agree that the fall has been farther. Cause it was higher. But I think if you take a step back from actual valuations and be like, what are the odds of a funding event occurring? Whether you're a new company raising a, you know, seed, pre seed or whatnot, or you're an existing company raising a, you know, a next round. Like, it went from almost, you know, I don't know, over 50%, over 70% in the past market to now. Like, firms are just very loath to part with capital, uh, right now, as Ben was saying, and I think that applies to any type of venture right now.
00:18:31.862 - 00:18:33.038, Speaker C: That's super fair, David.
00:18:33.126 - 00:18:56.216, Speaker B: Like, every, every fund I know is in preserve capital mode, wait things out. Like, you know, they're not necessarily fully closed for business, but they're like, they're triaging their existing portfolio. And for new companies, like, the bar is very high. Like, forget what the valuation is. It's just like, are we going to deploy money at all? Is very high.
00:18:56.400 - 00:19:26.108, Speaker A: What do you think is behind that, that drawdown across the board? I mean, you can make all these arguments about crypto that I think. I have argued that if you didn't look at price, 2022 was the best year crypto has ever had, because it was when we started to get actual mainstream adoption and breakout, you saw some of the largest web two and web one and web zero. Companies like Google actually saying, we're going to bring crypto services into the back end of GCP. You saw Starbucks spinning up a thing. You saw lots of companies actually making.
00:19:26.196 - 00:19:29.028, Speaker B: Serious investments, people buying and using nfts.
00:19:29.116 - 00:19:45.880, Speaker A: Yeah. So I get the thesis on crypto where it's like we had Celsius, we had three arrows, we had FTX, we had all of these collapses. The confidence has been shaken in the market. But the thing that's kind of, I guess, a little surprising to me is the trickle down of that into, as David, you're describing venture overall.
00:19:46.052 - 00:20:17.760, Speaker C: Okay, so I don't think the, and maybe this is wrong, but I do not think crypto was the contagion that tanked the startup and public markets. I don't think it was a trickle into. I think crypto was sort of the furthest out on the risk curve when the whole thing collapsed, rather than being the reason why these other things have dramatically fallen in value. Have you talked about the numerator effect and the denominator effect from LP's on this show yet? Because that might be an interesting thing to dive into.
00:20:17.792 - 00:20:18.376, Speaker A: We haven't.
00:20:18.480 - 00:20:21.744, Speaker C: All right, so for folks just to.
00:20:21.784 - 00:20:30.904, Speaker B: Set the stage, too, for folks who don't know, LP's means limited partners. These are the folks who invest in venture funds, mostly institutions, university endowments, pension.
00:20:30.944 - 00:20:33.288, Speaker C: Funds, the like, increasingly sovereign wealth.
00:20:33.376 - 00:20:34.856, Speaker B: Sovereign wealth funds. Yep.
00:20:35.000 - 00:21:22.840, Speaker C: So flashback to the 2015 time period. We've got low interest rates. It's been seven, eight years since the great financial crisis, and it appears that you're having to climb further out on the risk curve to find return. And at the time, that didn't mean crypto. At the time, that meant venture capital. You should be allocating more of your investment portfolio to early stage things, higher beta things that could yield these nice big hundred x returns, like startups. And so these LP's, who were previously, like, 5% exposed to alternative asset classes, like venture capital, started to tick up seven, 8910, up to 15% a few years ago, because that's kind of where the opportunity was.
00:21:22.840 - 00:21:30.424, Speaker C: And so they ended up a little bit overexposed to higher risk things. And, of course, some crypto ended up in there, too.
00:21:30.544 - 00:22:22.012, Speaker B: And that's a huge problem because, say, you know, let's take a university endowment LP, because it's easy to understand. Say your Harvard's a bad example. Let's say you're Vanderbilt, great, great folks, great investors, great endowment, great university, but a little smaller. I don't know exactly what they're saying. Probably single digit billions, I would guess, endowment. Well, the purpose of that endowment is to spit off cash every year to fund the operations of the university, right? So, like, they invest in venture and private assets, alternative assets that are illiquid to grow the size of the endowment over time, but they have very real cash needs every year to come out of it. And so the majority of the endowment needs to stay invested in liquid securities, in cash, in real estate, in dividend stocks, things like that.
00:22:22.012 - 00:22:32.452, Speaker B: And so what Ben's describing, it's like a frog boiling. Like, oh, this makes sense. This makes sense. And then all of a sudden, you're like, holy crap, where's my cash generative part of my portfolio?
00:22:32.548 - 00:23:17.574, Speaker C: So this is the numerator effect. Then, the public markets, especially if you're invested in a whole bunch of stuff that recently went public, because you were invested, venture capital funds that distributed shares to you that you haven't yet sold, your public holdings drop by 50%, and then suddenly that now the denominator effect kicks in, where your 15% exposure to alternative assets or high risk assets jumps to 30% of your whole portfolio, and suddenly, every single owner of capital, or every single steward of capital, these LP's are hitting the panic button, going, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. We are way overexposed on the highest risk stuff. We are going to be great partners and we're going to honor all the commitments that we have.
00:23:17.734 - 00:23:30.358, Speaker B: But maybe, I think the top tier, established ones are doing that, but I think there are a lot of LP's that are defaulting on their capital commitments right now. A call will go out from a fund to sit, because funds don't take all the cash and have it sit in a bank account at once.
00:23:30.406 - 00:23:41.934, Speaker A: They draw. It's a good piece to really dig into. As you're saying is that, like, you may hear that a company raised a $2 billion fund, but it's not like they have $2 billion in a bank account waiting to be deployed. They only have a fraction of that, actually.
00:23:42.514 - 00:23:52.986, Speaker C: They only want to call the minimum amount that they possibly need to, to make an investment one week from now so that their IRR clock doesn't start until they call the capital.
00:23:53.130 - 00:24:25.446, Speaker B: Yep. And this is, you know, this is all kind of more esoteric than. But the point here is that, like, for a lot of LP's, again, not the university endowments and the like, they honor their commitments, but for a lot of LP's out there, they may have these outstanding commitments that they've made and that cash they need to fund into these funds. They're now getting requests from these funds saying, hey, you know that cash you committed to me, now I need another portion of it. A lot of them are saying like, hey, guys, I love you, but I don't have the cash right now. So.
00:24:25.630 - 00:24:52.086, Speaker C: And even if they're not, VC's are very aware of this pressure. So this winds us all the way back to the beginning to why? Why did we start, start talking about this? This is an extreme counter incentive for venture capitalists to deploy funds quickly because it's going to be extremely hard to go raise another fund because every LP is currently just like, holding the fort, saying we're trying to make the commitments we've already made, it's really hard for us to make new commitments right now.
00:24:52.190 - 00:25:14.792, Speaker B: So there's even a little more nuance to it than that. There's raising another fund. There's also this dynamic of, if I put out a request for what's called a capital call, which request my lP's to send me some of the money, right now, I'm putting my LP's in a tough spot. I know I am. And so, like, I want to, you know, I don't really want to do that.
00:25:14.888 - 00:25:27.166, Speaker C: Right. Because what you're implicitly doing, since none of them have cash on hand, is saying when you send that capital call, which again, is a contractually agreed to thing, where when you send it, they have to honor the commitment.
00:25:27.350 - 00:25:38.542, Speaker B: You're saying the remedy, if they don't is you basically like repatriate and nationalize all the cash that they've already given you, so they lose their entire investment if they don't.
00:25:38.678 - 00:26:12.694, Speaker C: So what you're basically implicitly saying is, hey, I know the market's really low right now, and I know anything that you liquidate is at a terrible price that you don't want to liquidate. But I'm sending you a thing that says go liquidate a public position to be able to fund my capital call, which sucks. And every VC is trying to think in decades, not months, and honor these relationships. And so you're trying to only put people in a tough position when you absolutely have to. So I think this dynamic is the thing that's missed when everyone's like, oh, there's so much dry powder, it's like, how dry is it really?
00:26:13.274 - 00:26:18.530, Speaker A: Right, it's dry powder, but it's 40 miles away in a vault in a mountain somewhere and we gotta go get it right.
00:26:18.602 - 00:26:42.348, Speaker B: The much easier thing to do here, as we're seeing, and believe me, VC's love to take the easy path in general is just don't invest in new companies, right? There's no penalty for not investing. So that's a huge part of why all these funds are just like, I'll look at a lot of companies right now, but I'm not actually going to make many investments, whether it's web3 or SaaS or whatever.
00:26:42.476 - 00:27:22.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's actually the most dangerous thing for founders. And sort of like, if I'm going to put on my, my GDP hat and think like, what's the best thing for the US as a country long term, or anyone as an economy long term, it's that innovation gets dampened in times like this because people think there's available capital to fund their new innovative thing and they get strung out in a long process where there's actually not capital available. And so we're counseling all the founders in our portfolio to ask things like when was the last time you wired a check to a new portfolio company and things like that, just to get a sense of where the firm actually is in their current check writing willingness.
00:27:22.322 - 00:27:28.842, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you with that, there's like twelve different directions we could take this in. How do you think we get out of this?
00:27:29.018 - 00:28:34.500, Speaker B: Well, the beautiful thing about capital markets and venture and all of its subsets are very much a capital market, is that they are dynamic, self regulating systems. And the way we get out of it is by exactly what's happening, because capital flows have dried up so much. That means that attractive returns will reemerge as attractive because prices are coming down and entrepreneurs who are building great companies are still out there. They're having a harder time getting funded. You can get into them now, just like the binary can I invest? Is now much more available, and can I invest at attractive prices? Thus, returns will start to go up over the coming years. Like, now is a great time to actually be investing because everybody else is structurally incentivized not to invest. As those points start to get put on the board, it will attract more capital back, the spigots will turn back on, and then we will get back to equilibrium.
00:28:34.572 - 00:28:57.902, Speaker C: The very same opportunities that would have cost you 150 million pre two years ago literally cost you six to 10 million. So it's like, to the extent that those companies are going to be able to find more capital in the future and exit, that's quite a significant multiple on whatever your original investment was, assuming that it has a fixed outcome amount.
00:28:57.998 - 00:29:22.354, Speaker B: If you look at the isolated to crypto crash in 2017, 2018 after the ICO boom, and then you look at the investments that were made out of it, they were made by relatively new firms that nobody knew of at the time, like the multi coins and the like, that were new startup in incredible projects and opportunities like Solana. Right. And then those firms made billions. Like the same thing's going to happen here.
00:29:22.654 - 00:29:26.302, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the seed round of Solana was 25 mil valuation.
00:29:26.478 - 00:29:36.834, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Like that. We are now back in those days and somebody, some buddies are going to make a lot of money, and then that's going to attract more capital back.
00:29:37.324 - 00:30:18.706, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is the piece that it feels confusing from the non investor side of things as to why this structure is happening. And I think you guys did an incredibly good job laying out where the capital call components really influence how funds are thinking about this. At the same time, though, it feels like the choice to not invest right now seems to be a choice that says things I previously had conviction about, I no longer have conviction about. It's an interesting one, because by not deploying capital, there is a criticism that says, it seems like you didn't believe in the thesis your fund was based on. If you felt comfortable deploying capital 150, but you don't feel comfortable deploying capital at 16.
00:30:18.890 - 00:30:54.342, Speaker C: Well, this exposes the principal agent problem. So in a GPLP relationship, you're aligned in most ways, but you're not aligned in some ways. And one of those ways includes the owners of the capital. The principals of capital don't care about your next fund. Like the dollar in my fund one has no feelings about a dollar in my fund two. But the GP totally wants there to be a fund two. And then in the boom times, was incentivized to deploy fund one dollars pretty quickly so they could go raise a fund two.
00:30:54.342 - 00:31:33.380, Speaker C: And even though the fund one dollars don't feel great about that, that's what the incentive was for the GP. The incentive is now completely flipped for the GP to not deploy those fund one dollars so they don't have to go and do the scary, exposed thing of trying to raise a fund two in this environment. And so this teases out that principal agent issue, where before you might have had enough conviction. If you sum your level of conviction with your incentive to deploy, you got over the hurdle to be able to write checks. Whereas now, if you sum the level of conviction with the negative incentive to deploy, you don't get over that hump.
00:31:33.492 - 00:32:21.212, Speaker B: Yeah. Perhaps to even put a finer point on it, I was saying a minute ago, it was new firms after the ICO crash that made these investments. The dynamic, I think, is that once you have a fund or a couple funds, once you have an established firm, as Ben was saying, your set of investments, your visceral set of investments, is extremely different than when you are new entering the market. And that's because of manufacturing management fees. Once you have capital under management, you have a path to getting very wealthy by doing nothing, which is sit there and collect your contractually obligated management fees from managing the fund, which, if you're managing a significant amount of capital, is life changing money guaranteed. As long as you don't do anything stupid.
00:32:21.388 - 00:32:25.212, Speaker A: Yeah. 2% on a $200 million fund is a lot of money a year.
00:32:25.268 - 00:32:37.708, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a lot of money a year. Exactly. It's 2% every year for ten years. So it's 20% of a $200 million fund, which is. Is $40 million. And a $200 million fund is not that large. Right.
00:32:37.708 - 00:32:49.984, Speaker B: That's very different from the incentives you have if you are trying to break into the market and generate interesting enough returns to enable you to raise a fund. Like, it's a total innovator's dilemma type of problem.
00:32:50.804 - 00:32:59.004, Speaker A: So I have heard that the first fund of a firm usually outperforms all subsequent funds. Is this part of the dynamic?
00:32:59.044 - 00:33:36.924, Speaker C: That's survivorship bias, because most fund ones actually don't have fund twos. And so the people that are able to raise killer fund twos and threes that you know about are because they had an amazing fund one. And the reason that it's lower is reversion to the mean. Like, if you're, I don't know the actual number, but people often cite the lowercase capital fund one, which was like a $10 million fund, Chris Saka's original investment in Uber and Twitter. Something like an ADX on a tiny fund. Of course you're going to have reversion to the mean after that. That is a four standard deviation event.
00:33:36.924 - 00:33:52.436, Speaker C: And so it's like, well, actually what's going to happen is most fund ones will die, and then a few of these fund ones will do ridiculously well. And then, of course, the funds after that won't do as well because it was like the greatest return in history. That is some component skill, some component luck. But there is luck.
00:33:52.500 - 00:34:28.771, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's this famous observed state that no managed fund has ever outperformed an index fund over a long enough time horizon. This doesn't mean that managed funds don't have a role, they just have a very different role than an index fund does. How would you describe venture funds? I think the average venture return over a ten year period is like negative 0.1%. So on its face, this is a whole class. That makes no sense. But there's obviously a reason that this makes sense.
00:34:28.771 - 00:34:35.131, Speaker A: What is the reason? What is the function of a venture fund? The same way that a managed fund has a function.
00:34:35.267 - 00:34:38.747, Speaker B: When you get it right, you get it really right. That is the function.
00:34:38.835 - 00:35:30.226, Speaker C: There's a couple of statistical interesting things about venture that make it different than other asset classes. One is, you absolutely do not want to index venture. The median performing venture return to your point, is not only not s and p 500 beating, it's bad. So you only want to be in the top quartile, top decile venture funds, of which every GP is pretty sure they are, and every LP who's committing capital is pretty sure that they're investing in Lake Woebegone. Takes a super long time to know that. You don't know for ten years where the top decile and quintile actually are, but the saving grace is venture versus other asset classes. When you compare it against leveraged buyouts, pe, uh, public managers, it has extreme persistence of returns.
00:35:30.226 - 00:36:10.992, Speaker C: And what do I mean by that? A hedge fund manager who's the best in the world this year? Next year? There's almost no correlation between who the current best hedge fund manager is and next year's best hedge fund manager. It's like a complete new dice roll every year, whereas you go the other side of the spectrum is venture. Sequoia is probably going to have pretty great returns on their next fund because they had pretty great returns on this fund. Funds are actually predictive of the next fund's returns in venture, or at least directionally correct. And so that's why these sort of top franchises and there's lots of speculation as to why I think it's reasonable to think, oh, it's brand reputation. So your deal flow quality, Michael Doveson's.
00:36:11.008 - 00:36:16.790, Speaker B: Done a lot of good work on this. We talked about, we had him on acquired a couple of years ago, maybe we talked a lot about this.
00:36:16.902 - 00:36:33.670, Speaker C: Yep. But that's why there's extreme competition among LP's to get into the top franchises because unlike other asset classes, you actually do know that these are going to be the top quartile funds in future years.
00:36:33.862 - 00:36:39.086, Speaker A: That's funny. Yeah, I mean the past performance is no indicator of future returns. Seems to not necessarily be true in.
00:36:39.110 - 00:37:33.294, Speaker B: Venture well, but the nuance to that though is things change and nowhere do things change more than in technology and venture. So I think one of the reasons too why you had such a boom in capital flowing into web3 is everybody, I think, correctly identified that this is a moment when things can change and that dynamic can change. So if you look at take the classic top venture funds out there in traditional ventures, Sequoia Benchmark Founders Fund, I don't know whoever you want to put into that category category of the been established around for a long time venture funds by and large, although they did some web3 investing you tell me you're closer to the space than me I don't think anybody would identify them as the leaders the best web3 investors over this past cycle here it was newer entrants.
00:37:33.714 - 00:37:47.786, Speaker A: I want to shift our conversation a little bit in this direction. I don't think most venture fund investors consider themselves to be like an Ajax investor, right?
00:37:47.890 - 00:37:50.574, Speaker C: Like asynchronous, JavaScript and XML.
00:37:50.874 - 00:38:41.926, Speaker A: Yes, exactly right. Most venture funds don't consider themselves to be a technology investment in terms of a specific piece of underlying technology. If you are investing in SaaS, you're not investing in SaaS built on X or Y or Z. You're investing on a more of a business model than anything else. But what we've seen in venture is some of the best turning funds are extremely technical. The place that they have to play in here I'm thinking of something like Dragonfly Capital or paradigm they have engineers on like as gps who are looking from a technical perspective about how these things work. What about either the stage that crypto is at now, or the entire paradigm of that technology makes that dynamic the case, when that is not the case in most other classes of venture?
00:38:42.050 - 00:39:35.256, Speaker B: I think it may be the stage that crypto has been at. One of the things about this industry is you never know how things will evolve. And making predictions is a surefire way to look silly. But I would guess, I think it's more likely than not that web3 crypto investing will evolve to look more like the business model first model that you're describing. It's just until recently, perhaps even still now, the technologies have been so immature that you had to be very technical to understand things. I think if you look back at the beginning of SaaS investing, you actually had to be. And when emergence started as the very first SaaS focused, SaaS only investment firm, you had to be relatively technical to understand what was going on.
00:39:35.256 - 00:39:35.784, Speaker B: That's true.
00:39:35.824 - 00:39:46.072, Speaker C: It didn't seem like it would work. All this traffic coming into a very small set of servers to host a bunch of different companies applications like it was reasonably non consensus.
00:39:46.168 - 00:40:21.214, Speaker B: Yeah, and technical, not just from an engineering standpoint, but also from a financial and investing standpoint. It was a very long time before it was broadly understood how good a business SaaS companies were, because their accounting is all messed up. Right? And so, like, if you couldn't see past that accounting, you like the narrative. Certainly on Wall street and among a lot of classic VC's was like, hey, SaaS, these are bad companies. And the opposite way is true, of course. And I think a lot of the same applies to web3.
00:40:21.674 - 00:41:02.124, Speaker C: I actually think if the literal, exact same thing applies to web3, where because these companies were raising money and capitalizing themselves differently and distributing ownership differently, it required a pretty dedicated person on the team, or in fact dedicated back office or a completely dedicated new fund to be able to make these types of investments. If crypto investing or web3 investing had been funding Delaware C Corps with regular cap tables that happened to be building on these technologies, I actually think it would have been much more integrated into ordinary firms and way fewer specialized firms.
00:41:03.244 - 00:41:41.492, Speaker A: Interesting. So one of the critiques that you hear from, let's call them the classical investor group, is that there's no revenue model in web3, which is largely true. Even if you look at like, Ethereum after the upgrade that they did, that meant that 50% of transaction fees are burned. It's barely deflationary at this point. Like, fundamentally, you're still printing more ETH or the reduction rate is low single digit percentages at this point. There's this whole idea of protocol revenue that popped up for a while, which I've always been a big opposition to. I think protocol revenue is a fancy rebrand of value extractive tax as applied to a blockchain.
00:41:41.492 - 00:41:54.916, Speaker A: But it's kind of interesting that there isn't really. It feels like we're still in the phase of the web two early growth model of just get a big enough audience and we'll figure out something in the end. And that industry landed on ads and we're not really sure what crypto lands.
00:41:54.940 - 00:42:18.626, Speaker C: On yet, which to me I think you just articulated why there's a freeze in crypto investing right now. Because in investing in most companies, there's a whole set of risks I got to get over. Let's be obnoxious about them. This isn't fraud. The founders aren't going to fight and blow this whole thing up. The customers actually want what they're selling. The product is good enough to fulfill the customer's needs.
00:42:18.626 - 00:43:05.142, Speaker C: This is a real problem. There's some checklist, and for every crypto company there's an additional checklist item on top, which is there is a profitable opportunity here to sell something to customers. And I think that everyone's like, wait, why would I take that risk when there's attractive returns that don't include that risk? And so to me that this is the way that like crypto can have billions of dollars flow in, is to make that checkbox the same as it is for the web two world, which is like, yeah, there's a business model. Yeah, customers are willing to pay for this. Yeah, there's, there's positive unit economics in a way aware that the company can accrue enterprise value over time because it has free cash flow.
00:43:05.318 - 00:43:36.182, Speaker B: It's funny that you mentioned the web two industry landed on ads and it's true. This exact same thing happened with Internet businesses and web two exact. If you look at the history of Google, it is this. Google raised at the then moment in time, like the one of the craziest, hottest, highest valuation for little business traction or opportunity series a's of all time. Nobody knew what the business model of Google was going to be for years. For years. I mean, literally years.
00:43:36.182 - 00:43:38.182, Speaker B: They made no revenue short, short number.
00:43:38.198 - 00:43:41.726, Speaker C: Of years, because they ipo'd like three and a half years after they're founded.
00:43:41.790 - 00:43:52.782, Speaker B: They were founded in what, like 97, 98, 98. And then the IPO was, the IPO was 2004, I think they'd only figured out the business model, if I remember right, 2001, 2002.
00:43:52.878 - 00:43:55.310, Speaker C: But they were enormously cash generative at IPO.
00:43:55.342 - 00:44:04.458, Speaker B: At the IPO, yes, yes. It happened very quickly, but there were, there were, call it two to somewhere between two and four years, I think, where there was no cash. There was no.
00:44:04.506 - 00:44:06.378, Speaker C: As exemplified by Duglione's quote.
00:44:06.466 - 00:44:17.534, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Which was. Oh, no, it was Mike Moritz's quote that Doug repeated to us, which was that Sequoia, who along with Kleiner invested in Google, said, never have we paid so much for so little.
00:44:17.954 - 00:44:22.334, Speaker C: Like immediately after wiring the money, they were like, we got caught up in this one.
00:44:23.074 - 00:44:46.754, Speaker B: But nobody knew. Nobody knew at the time how. But what they did know was people want this, this provides some utility. And I think if that can be the case, and for a lot of that is still a question mark for a lot of web3. But if you can prove that that's the case, capitalism is such, you will always figure out how to make money on that. And that's what Google did beautifully.
00:44:47.134 - 00:45:25.798, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really interesting one because you've seen a lot of companies that have been on the sidelines of a lot of tech for a while genuinely panicked about AI. And I think that's such an interesting comparison to draw where, for whatever reason, that has scared the crap out of a huge number of these both publicly traded companies and just sort of old legacy companies, to the point where they're just trying to force AI in whatever way possible into their product stack and that at the same time, this is, for whatever reason, they haven't felt the same conviction that crypto is an existential threat to their three to five year future.
00:45:25.966 - 00:45:43.434, Speaker C: It is pretty interesting that basically every big tech company has done some big, not quite bet the farm thing, but some weird big thing in the last couple of months around AI. You saw obviously, Bing chat being the biggest one.
00:45:43.734 - 00:45:44.766, Speaker A: Saucy bing.
00:45:44.910 - 00:46:22.928, Speaker C: Google's Bard Facebook meta, just yesterday announced they're organizing a new top level group, top level product group around generative AI. Amazon, I guess, would be the one where we don't really know what they're going to do yet. They presumably need an answer since Azure is going to make a ton of money off of licensing, being the only commercial distributor of OpenAI's APIs. But you raise this interesting point that none of them, save for maybe meta doing libre or calibre any of the various names, or diem, but never had an existential thing around web3.
00:46:23.056 - 00:46:44.608, Speaker A: Right. And even after that, they very quickly pivoted to. It's not actually crypto, it's the metaverse, which I think we've seen play out rather poorly across the board for companies that felt that fear. Yeah, I feel like we could keep going for another hour here, but I've got to let you guys go soon before we wrap up. If listeners aren't in the acquired family yet, what episode should they start with?
00:46:44.736 - 00:46:51.320, Speaker C: Well, first of all, you can find David and I podcasting in any podcast player by searching acquired or going to acquired fm.
00:46:51.472 - 00:46:52.888, Speaker B: You've said that before, Ben, haven't you?
00:46:52.936 - 00:47:25.552, Speaker C: I know. I'm on Twitter at gilbert g I l b e r t. David is e n t. And if you want what I truly feel is, like, probably the best canonical zero to one on bitcoin or ethereum on like, coming up to speed from what are the fundamental pieces of technology that enable this to work? What's the full story? Why are these interesting revolutionary technologies then? The bitcoin and ethereum episodes are pretty seminal pieces of acquired.
00:47:25.608 - 00:47:31.008, Speaker B: Well, what we did, we really tried to tell the history of how did things come about?
00:47:31.136 - 00:47:51.632, Speaker A: I would also plug the SpaceX episode. I think that was one of the more fun episodes. It's kind of an older one at this point, but just the story there that takes you into so much background that maybe that I didn't know, as someone who thought I knew SpaceX pretty well, was fascinating to me. Well, Ben, David, thanks so much for joining us on validated.
00:47:51.808 - 00:47:53.288, Speaker C: You bet. Thanks for having us.
00:47:53.416 - 00:47:54.324, Speaker B: Thank you.
