00:00:08.240 - 00:00:52.955, Speaker A: Hi, how are you? My name is Mike, I'm co founder of Sling and I'm here to demo for you the money button for the world. We think you should be able to send money to anyone in the world whether they're next to you or 3,000 miles away instantly. And that's what we built at Sling by integrating Solana, stablecoins and real time payment networks all over the world. We have a few principles for how we build this. The first is that you should be able to pay anyone anywhere. The second is that it should be incredibly easy to use, it should work instantly and it should cost a lot less than traditional money transfer products. And I want to start by just showing you a demo of my co founder sending money from Europe to Kenya.
00:00:52.955 - 00:01:03.618, Speaker A: This is Simon, he's sending 7,000 shillings worth of USDP to Caleb who's in Nairobi.
00:01:03.753 - 00:01:15.935, Speaker B: 7,000? Dude, that's generous. So cool. Withdrawn. And then I'm gonna check my investor 10 times.
00:01:16.035 - 00:01:16.485, Speaker A: 2000.
00:01:16.945 - 00:01:17.529, Speaker B: Cool.
00:01:17.617 - 00:02:07.885, Speaker A: It arrives straight from Europe to M? Pesa in less than a minute. And the way this works so you can add money, we've done a ton of work to integrate all sorts of different instant financial systems so that you have a very simple, very consistent experience all over. So that was Apple Pay. Here you have adding money with M Pesa and this is, we don't just do M Pesa, it's actually a ton of mobile wallet providers all over Africa. And you just enter your M? Pesa pin and you've got USDP in your wallet. And to add in Brazil it's also just super easy. It works slightly different because pix works differently than these things but you just copy that string, you paste it into Nubank or whatever bank you use in Brazil and pronto the money is in your Sling wallet.
00:02:07.885 - 00:02:38.585, Speaker A: And then to send money to somebody else, everybody on Sling is in the directory and you can just search for them, you can denominate your transaction. Whatever currency you want, we calculate in real time how much USDP to send to them. And you send and you're done. And it's that easy. And then they can off ramp do whatever they want with it. And to send to somebody who doesn't have Sling you just send them a text message with the money on it. It's a one time use self custodial Solana wallet that they can offramp from directly across our footprint.
00:02:38.585 - 00:03:28.535, Speaker A: And withdrawing money from Sling, also super easy. So this is withdrawing euros with Sepa instant and it's done. If you're in Jamaica you can just send a push payment to your Jamaican debit card. And this is instant. This is so fast that the money is in your bank account, Jamaican dollars faster than you can switch apps. And here you are with Schillings again into M Pesa, which you already saw a little bit beautiful and simple and with pics. And I can't tell you how much work it is to integrate all of these so that they basically work the same and they're instant all over the world.
00:03:28.535 - 00:04:07.405, Speaker A: And Sling under the hood is a self custodial wallet. We really believe that you should own your own money. So you know, you can get your key, you can copy it, you can paste it into Phantom, you can do whatever you want. It's all yours. We have no access to the key whatsoever. And you know, we gave a demo about a year ago at Breakpoint in Amsterdam and some of you have been testing Sling for us over the course of the last year and we've heard your feedback, which is that, well, everybody just asks us like can we add stablecoins? And as of today the answer is yes. So you can just get your wallet details from Sling, you can send some USDC in and there it is.
00:04:07.405 - 00:05:07.381, Speaker A: And you can withdraw on Solana as well with USDC and usdp. And the way we've done this, you know, we've seamlessly integrated a self custodial wallet with stablecoins and fiat payment rails all over the world, which means that when you sign up you have to kyc, but it's incredibly fast, it takes about a minute, really easy to do. And as a result of that, we've got instant ramps across 75 countries so far with a bunch more coming soon, including the US imminently. And now that we have interoperability across the Solana ecosystem, we also support wallets and exchanges in another 75 countries, which means together the directory and instant transfers work across 150 plus countries. And we just think that this is a really important thing. We think everybody in the world should be connected to an instant global financial system. We think that this has the potential to be incredibly impactful for a lot of people.
00:05:07.381 - 00:05:28.355, Speaker A: You know, if you can send a text message to anyone in the world, if you can send a photo to anyone in the world and they get it instantly and it's free, you should be able to do the same with money. And we're just really excited. Please download Sling, give it a shot, you can get in code Breakpoint and please let us know what you think. Thank you very much.
