00:00:03.360 - 00:00:22.594, Speaker A: Hi, good afternoon. My name is Tiffany. I work on the Solana foundation, primarily working with game studios and many of which are here with us today. As a round of introductions, I'll go from Addy all the way to Mason. So, Addy, feel free to introduce yourself.
00:00:22.974 - 00:00:50.664, Speaker B: Thanks. Thanks, Tiffany. It's a pleasure to be here. My name is Adi Abili and I'm heading up Reign of Titans, which is a battler card game that we've built on the Solana blockchain. It composes of Titan NFTs. My background is I have been in web3 for a while. I started off in crypto, like many people, I think, getting into web3 and gradually transitioned over to web3 more broadly.
00:00:50.664 - 00:00:56.584, Speaker B: Been in finance and innovation for a while and really focusing on how we can provide value through technology.
00:00:58.224 - 00:01:43.314, Speaker C: Awesome. Well, thanks, everybody, for coming. My name is Simon. I'm the CEO of Mixmob, and a bit of my background is I started building games about 15 years ago, started making Facebook games, got lucky to create one of the fastest growing games on Facebook, then went into electronic arts, worked on FIFA, then poker stars, and now we're building Mix mobile. And just a little bit of context on mixmap. Mixmap is Mario Kart meets Hearthstone. So the excitement of racing and synchronous play with the strategic component of cards, and it all revolves under one premise, which is, what would you do if an AI deleted our culture? In the story of our game, we build these masks to protect us from AI.
00:01:43.314 - 00:01:56.322, Speaker C: That was our first NFT collection, and then we build these robots to fight the AI. But before we fight them, we raised them. So that's our first game. That's a little bit about me. We're on incentivized beta. Go check us out. Mixmob IO.
00:01:56.322 - 00:01:59.134, Speaker C: And yeah. Excited to be here. Thank you.
00:02:00.474 - 00:02:28.528, Speaker D: Hello, everyone. I'm Mason. I've been working in gaming and web3 for full time about four years. I started on a creator advisory council at a platform called Rally IO, where I helped a bunch of gaming creators launch social tokens. And from there I moved to working with the games more directly. So I work with pairs parallel, which is a really exciting upcoming web3 TCG. They're currently enclosed beta, and I'm here mainly to talk about my own project, which is alchemy.
00:02:28.528 - 00:02:35.124, Speaker D: It's a rpg turn based, and we have an idle strategy mode. It's played entirely in Discord.
00:02:36.144 - 00:03:06.224, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you all for the wonderful introductions. Next off, I want to kick us off the panel about acquiring users with a question focused on your community right now and how that has been empowering your game IP with acquiring more and more users. So how has the strength of your community and things that you've been doing for your community impacted that? I'll kick over to Mason first to put you in the spotlight.
00:03:06.344 - 00:03:27.154, Speaker D: Yeah. Awesome. So I was actually really excited for this one. We've done something really unique with our game because it's entirely played in Discord. We have sort of like a unique take on how we acquire users. So we built this in a way that you can actually install the bot in any discord server. And our goal is to onboard sort of the hundreds of millions of discord users into web3.
00:03:27.154 - 00:04:06.204, Speaker D: Whenever somebody plays our game for the first time, we automatically create a wallet on their behalf. And so it's a really easy way to onboard people onto Solana. It's also great for other communities to be able to install this bottom and we can drive traffic to their Discord server with custom quest lines that are only playable in their server. And we sort of look at Discord servers as like, cities of a sort. And your goal is to increase tourism to your city. It's your chance for people to discover more about your Discord server, possibly make some friends, maybe spend some money or acquire your products. And we hope to be a way to push users around from Discord to discord through the game.
00:04:06.744 - 00:04:35.284, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And, you know, the game mechanic is very interesting. I've never really played like a game that's fully on Discord, but super cool. Simon, I really want to better understand as well. You know, you spent, I think, over a year plus now building a community. Two weeks ago, there was an event online with you guys. So very curious as to, you know, what you guys did in the beginning to kind of also retain users and continuously acquire more.
00:04:35.644 - 00:05:06.560, Speaker C: Absolutely. First, I love what you guys are doing. So go check alchemy out. It reminds me of when Facebook games started picking up and it's now in a totally different platform, which is discord. So really cool stuff from our side. So, yeah, just to answer your question directly, what we're doing on our side is we're doubling down on web3 gamers. And what we know is similar to when Facebook games started, when mobile games started.
00:05:06.560 - 00:05:34.778, Speaker C: It's a new category, web3 games. Crypto games are a new category. And I remember when I was building Facebook games, my friends in console, they were like, man, what are you doing? Why are you building Facebook games? These are nothing. And I was like, no, this is going to go somewhere. It's viral, it has new mechanics. I saw the potential of that. It developed a new category, and I'm seeing the exact same thing on web3 games, on crypto games.
00:05:34.778 - 00:06:17.742, Speaker C: And so that's the kind of user we're going for. Because if we start going for all type of users, web two, all cons, you're going to get with nobody. But from our side, we are really targeting crypto users. And the way we acquire from our side, it's a bit different from what you guys are doing because you guys have the platform that has the innate virality from us. We have two things. One is advertising and incentivization. So we are in a stage, it's called incentivize beta, and we incentivize our players to come test the game, try it out, and we give them rewards, and that helps a lot.
00:06:17.742 - 00:06:51.064, Speaker C: And then it's something that we can only do on web3 with what we have with crypto, nfTs, et cetera. And the second thing is we advertise where web3 and crypto users are, which is brave. Brave is a platform, is a browser base that already exists. There's, I think, 60 to 100 million monthly active users, and they're all, or most of them are native to crypto. So we have a partnership with them and we advertise with them. And so what we do is we do it in gates and in stages. And right now, like I said, we're incentivized beta.
00:06:51.064 - 00:07:22.748, Speaker C: So we bring players, we take them on our discord in our community, and we funnel them towards the things that we want them to go and do. And with the idea that in the future, this category, this group of people are going to be our ambassadors to bring others. And so in conclusion, that's it. Focus on web3 cryptonatives advertise where they live. And that's our key. Focus and incentivize beta.
00:07:22.876 - 00:07:44.838, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And I really like the ambassador model as well that you guys are trying to work on. And then, addy, love to better understand reign of titans. You guys did a NFT launch, I believe, last year around this time, and have been heads down building and now have probably had a bunch of few partnerships. So we'd love to hear a little bit more on that side.
00:07:45.006 - 00:08:20.742, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it really couples with your question around how you're acquiring users. And interestingly for us, you know, I agree with everything you're saying there, Simon, but for us, with reign of Titans, we actually are focusing on a web3 and a web two audience. So we want to focus on bringing the mass into web3 and try to open up the space. So a lot of what we do is focused around brand partnerships to be able to bring in these web two users. So, for example, with Reign of Titans, it's a card based strategy game. So you said your game is like Hearthstone meets Mario Kart.
00:08:20.742 - 00:08:47.780, Speaker B: So we're very much like Hearthstone, almost like a Pokemon style. And we have a tournament model as part of what we're doing with Reign of Titans. So we just held a tournament in partnership with PEPC in Argentina, actually on the ground. So we were able to start to acquire a lot of users through this tournament model to offer large cash prizes to incentivize people. So we believe in the web3 space. I mean, wholeheartedly. That's why we're here.
00:08:47.780 - 00:09:07.204, Speaker B: A lot of our community today is actually web3 native, and we really rely on this community to also bring in others. So word of mouth referrals when it comes to really opening up the space has been very successful for us and these brand partnerships to really try to open up the space to acquire more users into web3.
00:09:07.704 - 00:09:14.528, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And I saw a bunch of photos from the Argentina activation as well. So congrats there.
00:09:14.616 - 00:09:15.408, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:09:15.576 - 00:09:43.374, Speaker A: I want to also shift gears a little bit to ask a question about, you know, there's web two page UA, traditional realms, like, as you mentioned, Simon, with like Facebook and those kind of paid channels. What are some of the new ways and methods that are recently created due to web3? And have you guys tried using or activating on that side? Jump ball, I guess. Simon.
00:09:43.754 - 00:10:16.638, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So what we've done is we created a strategy where when we launch our NFT collection, that was right before we even launched our game. And even if people ask me today, hey, would you do it the same way? I would 100% do it the same way. Because what happened is you launch a collection thinking about the game you're building. Your nFTs are a validation of the game, the IP, the art, the story. And if that collection resonates, you start building that community. And that's what happened to us.
00:10:16.638 - 00:11:16.278, Speaker C: And I'm sure that it's happened to both of you, right, and to all of us here. So that gives us our really loyal community. And shout out to Lucas over here from our community, came all the way to represent, mix mob and help us with the conference. So you create these really loyal community members and ambassadors that are almost like part of an extension of your team and in fact, we are 20 full time people and eight are people that come straight from the community. So we did that native to web3, launched our collection, started validating the game with them in a closed environment to make it really good, safe, secure. And then eventually what we did is we started opening channels, more traditional channels like advertising, but with the focus that I was mentioning, more focus on web3 or crypto users. And in essence, that would be my strategy recommendation if you're building crypto games.
00:11:16.278 - 00:11:47.882, Speaker C: Plus something that you said is fantastic is we also just launched a tournament and we had 4000 people watching this tournament. Our game is super competitive and it was really nice. So tournament with cash prices. And remember, all these audience, what they want is they want incentives like we want incentives. Crypto is built in a really nice way for incentivization. So we use that with our incentivized beta as well. So in summary, nfTs, crypto channels and incentivized players with what you have, which is token or nfts.
00:11:48.048 - 00:12:17.234, Speaker A: Definitely there's something about racing games that gets people going. So 100% agree. And in Mason, I want to touch upon, you know, you're building your game on fully on Discord, which is very, I think, interesting. Also a model that we haven't really seen too often. In most cases, it's like we'll put our game on Steam, we'll put our game on epic, et cetera. So how is your team going about that? You know, acquisition of users, just targeting discord members or creating kind of a new onboarding system?
00:12:17.374 - 00:12:17.602, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:17.618 - 00:13:04.540, Speaker D: So I talked a bit about before how it's installable in any other server, so you can naturally like run tournaments for your community or just have them play in there. But also we wanted to go one step further and establish deeper relationships with some of these communities. So one of the ways we do that is you can actually brand certain territories within the game itself. So if your community is getting very into the game and they're playing it and they're collecting a lot of these things we call land shards, they can actually purchase one of the territories in the game and then they can vote to brand it however they want. So you can imagine like a Solana, NFT community really enjoys playing the game a lot. They're participating in tournaments and winning and they want to represent themselves in the world. So now they can have a territory and it actually competes with the other territories and it has a ranking and a leaderboard.
00:13:04.540 - 00:13:27.704, Speaker D: And that's part of, you know, Simon was talking about in these incentive models we don't want to just incentivize players to play. We also want to incentivize them to collaborate, brand territories and win against the other ones as a form of competition, same as you would see in a sports league. And then people kind of create their tribes and they can have a lot more fun feeling like they truly own a piece of this world.
00:13:28.284 - 00:13:55.440, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah, definitely. That sounds super cool. And if you guys haven't checked it out, definitely go out and play alchemy. And then addy, I know you guys have done a physical kind of IRL activation in Argentina. Are there any other plans and partnerships down the line as well for these IRL activations? Or are you sticking mostly on the virtual world? Curious about that side, yeah.
00:13:55.512 - 00:14:27.696, Speaker B: I mean, for us, we want to explore all of it, right? Like how much can we do? We can do at once. But definitely we see that value when it comes to IrL, we really believe in bringing value to our community, to our players. Right. Like, we look at traditional channels very much as almost extracting value when it comes to gaming. Right. So how can we really bring it back? And tournaments has been a very successful way for us to do that so far. I mean, I think that both Simon and Mason touched on some really key points about that.
00:14:27.696 - 00:14:53.832, Speaker B: The community, are they your advocates? Right? You want to incentivize them along the way? And the relationship that we have with our community today is really deep and similar to what you were saying. Simon. We launched our, our NFT collection. It was a year ago, actually, at Solana breakpoint that we launched. So this really has some memories for us. And we've been with our community for the last year. They have been with us every step of the way building the game.
00:14:53.832 - 00:15:31.034, Speaker B: They make recommendations. They've decided the direction that the game has gone into to mold it to where it is today and what they want, where they see value, where we see that demand is in tournaments because they want that value. Right. And so how can we keep bringing that to the user? So for us, we're going to keep with this tournament model, definitely focusing on specific markets as well. When it comes to real life experiences working with brands, we've just had this one with PEPC and we're onboarding more brands currently to keep bringing that back to the gamer. But also, we do a lot of online tournaments as well. And online is important because that's when you start to get scale.
00:15:31.034 - 00:15:40.130, Speaker B: We've been saying we want to be onboarding web two into web3. And the way to do that is to be scaling. And you need to do that online as well.
00:15:40.282 - 00:15:57.814, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I think the online part is very important. And then last question for you guys. If I gave you $10,000 to spend for marketing paid UA, how would you and your team decide to spend it first come, first serve?
00:15:59.994 - 00:16:37.030, Speaker C: I can go just because we're in the middle of this. This is from our perspective, from obviously my experience and our type of game. I think that's what's important is what game are you building, what's your user and all of that. So remember, we're focusing on web3 crypto gamers. Our game is super competitive and it's what we called mid core game. And so for us, if I had $2,000 right now, I'll do it in two ways. Tournaments with incentivization for people to join the tournament.
00:16:37.030 - 00:17:08.784, Speaker C: And the other one, the other thing that I will do, I will spend is on ads to bring people to the tournament. And the third one is partner up with guilds. So inside of our ecosystem, there's all these guilds that have a ton of players. So we've partnered up with a lot of them. Some of them are even our investors, and they have tons of players. So you also partner up with them and give some incentivization to them for them to come to your tournament. That's the way I would do it.
00:17:09.164 - 00:17:46.292, Speaker D: I just wanted to say I love that you've both brought up tournaments. I think tournaments are such a great part of the gaming experience in general. And that was something we put into the game in the first version of it, even when it was super Alpha prototype, and we still run weekly tournaments now. But if I had to go with $10,000. Besides incentivizing tournaments, the one thing we also really care about with our project is UGC. So empowering our community to create, whether it's game skins or assets or monsters that you can fight against. We want this to be a world built by the players and communities that are a part of it.
00:17:46.292 - 00:18:09.444, Speaker D: And so I want to incentivize that more. How can we find the players that have a huge passion for developing these games and then, even if they're not developers themselves, empower them with different tools that we can build on the discord side that allow them to sort of, in the same way people would build custom maps for Warcraft three and StarCraft, they can build levels that you could go through, characters that you could play with in our game.
00:18:10.544 - 00:18:11.284, Speaker A: Nice.
00:18:12.024 - 00:19:11.612, Speaker B: So I'm going to have to answer this question in terms of percentage, because the monetary value is not going to be realistic to my answer right now, but I would say I would put 90% of it into giving it directly back to the player. So like you say, in terms of tournaments, in terms of partnership with other web3 communities offering some of their assets as prizes, for example, when you're playing, so 90% of it directly back to the players, then I would put 10% of it. And this is why I have to say percentages back into the actual game itself. So I would offer some kind of unique experience that's going to be happening through the gameplay, through a specific piece of time. So whether it's a new kind of move that's happening in the game, this is a battle game that we have. So it's like two titans are fighting each other. So something in the actual gameplay experience, because for us, we also hold that really core, making sure that we build a quality game that offers unique experiences whilst you're playing and keeps evolving and getting better as you play.
00:19:11.612 - 00:19:15.984, Speaker B: So 90% of it back to the user, 10% of it in the game itself.
00:19:16.404 - 00:19:42.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. And then just one last question, I guess one piece of advice for any web3 game studio that's trying to get users, whether that's on the web two side or web3, a piece of advice I know you guys have been building for at least a year now, have seen kind of like the ups and downs of both the market and also kind of crypto in general. So any piece of advice would be very helpful.
00:19:45.154 - 00:20:05.694, Speaker D: I would say. I've seen a lot of trailers for games and they try and sort of bait people in with something that doesn't look quite like the game. And I think if you're just very open about this is what the gameplay looks like, and this is what the experience is going to be like, you're going to find your audience a lot easier. And so that's one thing we try to just be like, transparent about. You know, this is what the game is and this is the experience you're going to have when you play it.
00:20:06.744 - 00:20:48.984, Speaker C: For me, at a macro level, my advice would be really identify your audience. I know people say that, but really just know who your audience is. Because if you say, oh, we're going to target everybody and anybody, it's really hard. So narrow down on that audience, build that core community, and then the next thing will be identify your business model, your engine of growth. Is it viral? Like, for example, Mason's engine of growth? Because of the virality of discord or is it more like tournaments and advertising, like what we're doing with our game and identify those two things and then just double down on those tactics and go from there?
00:20:49.484 - 00:21:27.974, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I agree. I think that monetization and understanding your revenue stream is so key and understanding that early, you know, my advice would be forget the numbers when you're first starting. It's really about building deep, genuine connections with your community. We learned that very early on because the kind of connection that we have is so deep that it's something that we have never seen before. And off the back of that scale will always come. But focus on having genuine connections, like you say, with transparent relationships, open and honest and you'll be really surprised as to what your community will actually do for you and how they will advocate for you.
00:21:28.394 - 00:21:31.734, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you guys for joining me on this panel.
00:21:32.034 - 00:21:33.018, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:21:33.106 - 00:21:33.434, Speaker D: Thank you, guys.
