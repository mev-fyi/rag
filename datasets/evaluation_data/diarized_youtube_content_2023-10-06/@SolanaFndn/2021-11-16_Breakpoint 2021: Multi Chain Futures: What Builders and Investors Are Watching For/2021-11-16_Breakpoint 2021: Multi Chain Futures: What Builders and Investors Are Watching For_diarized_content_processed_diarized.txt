00:00:24.640 - 00:01:18.664, Speaker A: Hello. Thank you so much for joining our panel, and thank you, Austin, for that introduction. As Austin said, we are anti maximalist kind of approach and see our tribe, first and foremost, being the tribe of crypto and of blockchain. And there is an incredible amount of innovation, obviously, happening here in Solana. Outside of Solana, there has been continues to be an incredible amount of innovation as well. So we just wanted to bring some of those folks into breakpoint and look beyond the Solana ecosystem a little bit. And what are the innovations that are happening outside, how that relates to Solana? So myself, I'm Lily Liu with the Solana foundation, have been in around the blockchain world since the bitcoin days, have seen various iterations from when it was contemplated to be bitcoin only world, and then maybe a bitcoin versus ETH world.
00:01:18.664 - 00:01:35.314, Speaker A: And if you remember the lingo from a few years ago around so called ETH killers, my perspective has always been that there's room for more than one. And I think that that is happening in various forms today, and that's what we want to talk about. And so our panelists can also introduce themselves.
00:01:36.054 - 00:01:48.154, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, my name is Sunny. I've been working on the cosmos ecosystem for about four and a half years, and now I'm working on a project called Osmosis, which is an interchange Dex.
00:01:49.014 - 00:02:08.194, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. I'm Min. I'm the managing partner and co founder of etheroventures. It's an early stage investment firm set up by the former venture team of consensys. We invest in multi protocol applications once through the stack, and really excited to learn more about this lana ecosystem here.
00:02:08.854 - 00:02:30.634, Speaker D: Hey. Hey, guys. I'm Zen, and I'm one of the co founders of Taurus. We're a key management system that's simple and secure and is used for both wallets as well as applications all over the web. Three space. You guys might have used binance, smart chain wallet, Kepler, or kukai, or other numerous applications out there. We're down in the Lancy management system to that.
00:02:30.634 - 00:02:34.574, Speaker D: And, yeah, we've been doing this for about three years or so.
00:02:36.474 - 00:03:15.278, Speaker A: Great. So, you know, first off, it's very clear that we're not going to be in a world which is only bitcoin, only ethereum. But as we kind of see that landscape evolve, how do you see that in terms of. Is this, you know, a world of three chains, three dominant chains, ten infinite. Right. And also, how do you see that in terms of innovation? Truly, sort of with additional l one s platform layer or whether sort of innovation from here is primarily going to be at the application level. So let's start with you, sunny Cosmos, having been thinking about this for a few years.
00:03:15.446 - 00:04:10.832, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think my belief, and I guess like, you know, the reason I started working on Cosmos is I do believe that there's going to be a world with not, not ten, but more like hundreds or thousands of blockchains. And this comes, this stems primarily from the belief, my belief that like we're going to see a world of a proliferation of application specific blockchains. So instead of being like, you know, these layer one generalized protocols, and you have like, you know, hundreds and thousands of applications building on top of it, I think these generalized chains will, you know, stay around and there'll be applications building on top of them. But over time, more and more applications will graduate to becoming their own blockchain. And. Yeah, so, and then once that happens, you're going to need to have these many, many blockchains. And then what we've been building for like many years is like the tools to make it.
00:04:10.832 - 00:04:17.888, Speaker B: So like get ready for a world of hundreds of blockchains. That's where like the IBC protocol and all this stuff comes in.
00:04:18.016 - 00:04:28.654, Speaker A: Got it. So Min, do you share that perspective that it's, you know, hundreds of blockchains, or do you think it's more sort of around ten on that order and then most of the innovation is going to be running on top of that?
00:04:28.994 - 00:05:22.734, Speaker C: I think we believe in a very long range of use cases and that there are going to be many different approaches to suit the different developer preferences that can be use case specific, asset specific, even to some extent like cultural or even geographical. I think now that we have seen successful app chains like osmosis, I do think that it's non controversial to think that there's going to be a proliferation of them in the short term. At the same time, though, I think we remain pretty excited about some of the innovation possible innovation that happens on the l one side, especially as it relates to sort of consensus and execution. When you think about sort of privacy preserving l one s, you know, on the virtual machine side, like, it feels like there's still a lot of room to innovate there too, and it's important that we do. So.
00:05:24.544 - 00:05:26.576, Speaker A: Do you have any thoughts then?
00:05:26.680 - 00:06:20.262, Speaker D: Well, just to add on, like, I feel it boils down to really the fundamental difference of being an application chain relative to building on a platform chain itself ultimately, I don't know. I kind of have the perspective that with regards to platform chains. In today's world, you see only like several large platforms which really take the keynote, and it's a couple of them, it's like under ten of them, like Facebook, Google, et cetera and all that. But with applications, there will always be benefits to building the underlying incentives and network layers towards your application itself versus the interoperability you get on a platform chain. So I think the menu will probably come from application chains and there'll be a few platforms. That's my perspective, at least.
00:06:20.398 - 00:06:35.870, Speaker A: So given that we are at the Solana conference, do you think that there is a future where it's highly performant chains, for example, a number of Solana forked zones intraoperated by IBC?
00:06:36.062 - 00:06:58.918, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I think that the Solana software is probably the best layer one software that exists right now. And I bet it's only a matter of time until we start seeing people forking that software and using it to deploy new chains. Right? Like, we see it happen. We saw it happen with the EVM. You have like, so many chains that are based off of the EVM. You saw it happen with like, EOS, which at the time was like, you know, this is the scalable blockchain solution.
00:06:58.918 - 00:07:20.954, Speaker B: And like, you know, I think it's just a matter of time before we see many chains launching with the Solana software and, you know, even like, application specific chains. You know, if I want to build a social network, I, you know, what is Solana's TPS? Like 4000 DP's or something? I need all that TPS for my application. And so I'm going to go launch a social network using Solana software for my chain.
00:07:21.534 - 00:07:42.194, Speaker A: Got it. And Min, how do you see that interacting with an EVM world? Right? Because now, as people are thinking about sort of multi chain universes, there seems to be something around IBC, something around EVM, and that that actually is a bit of the mode around Ethereum in addition to sort of the adoption of the native chain itself.
00:07:42.534 - 00:08:49.164, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we see, you know, there's definitely, I think, a bias in our universe for, you know, EVM compatible models, which it feels like definitely will sustain. But at the same time, you know, things are about trade offs and, you know, we see a lot of our portfolio companies, like wanting to go cross chain. You know, at the same time, I think it's sort of balanced right between sort of existing dapps going cross chain. A lot of it is also because of, you know, it's easier onboarding via other ecosystems right now relative to Ethereum. Versus say the proliferation of new app chains that also come from a cost and scalability point. The question is just how long will that time period really exist and what's the longer term reason for people wanting to do that? One thing I think would really help people go cross chain better is just better dev tooling, better auditors, a lot more of an ecosystem and infrastructure with enabling people to do that because I do think the curiosity is certainly there within our portfolio and we've spoken to a lot of teams about it.
00:08:49.324 - 00:09:11.624, Speaker A: Got it. And so, you know, as we think about cross chain compatibility, there's such a flourishing of bridges out there right now. What do you think about sort of using bridges versus standardized protocols? I know Cosmos has a perspective on this. And how do you think the sort of bridging ecosystem is going to evolve?
00:09:12.834 - 00:10:10.690, Speaker B: I think so, yeah. There's this like, you know, thing between like bespoke bridges and you know, a generalized permissionless bridging protocol like IBC. And I think the IBC model is designed for a world of those hundreds to thousands of blockchains because when you have bespoke bridges, you know, I think that model, like for example, I'd say wormhole is almost actually somewhere in the middle. It's like somewhere in between generalized and bespoke. And I think it's really well designed for a world of like for connecting. You know, the term I use is famous blockchains, which is like, you know, blockchains that have like high, you know, mind share and like people want to connect to them. But like, you know, if I'm launching a new chain that's very experimental, you know, it's not the easiest thing for me to go to the wormhole guardian set and be like, hey, please integrate my random chain that you've never heard of yet into wormhole.
00:10:10.690 - 00:10:55.214, Speaker B: And, you know, example I'd use is like, you know, let's say Terra wanted to integrate with wormhole three years ago, back when it was just this tiny little fledgling project, would it have? No, but like maybe, but today, you know, you can't predict what's going to be important years from now. That's why IBC as this like permissionless bridging protocol that lets anything bridge together is important. And I guess with the future of bridge protocols, I think what's cool is like, I actually see like there'll be like a merging of these things. So I still think wormhole is important for a lot of reasons. I think it might even be like, you know, better for like bridging these like famous blockchains together. Right. And so I think what I'd like to see happen is more of a unification of the application layer semantics of these bridge protocols.
00:10:55.214 - 00:11:24.724, Speaker B: So in a bridge you have like, you know, the data format of what's being sent over the chain. There's like, if I'm sending tokens over the chain over between two chains, you know, there's a format to that packet. And it'd be really nice if we could standardize these formats across wormhole and IBc and, you know, whatever new bridge protocols come in, so that to the application developers, they don't care which bridge they're running over to them, it just feels the same.
00:11:26.664 - 00:12:06.524, Speaker D: I think standards are super important here, to be honest, because ultimately, when you're building your own, like when you're building on newer chains or your own application chain, you're building a lot of the infrastructure from ground up. And bridges are just part of that infrastructure that with standards really can help you, like, accelerate that process. Ultimately, I think that like. But hopefully the standards pan out in web, it's panned out, but there's like 50 standards in web as well. And hopefully it's not the same with bridges in web3 space.
00:12:07.504 - 00:12:11.284, Speaker A: And in terms of value accrual to bridges. How do you see that playing out? Minh?
00:12:11.664 - 00:12:49.334, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's a great question from an investment perspective. And we know being in the space that is very much driven by narrative, right. And right now, bridging tech is kind of in its phase one narrative. And, you know, I think a lot of bridges, especially this or state sponsored ones, are designed to sort of divert, like, liquidity from Ethereum. But it seems like right now that bridge is downward sloping to Ethereum. To be honest, I don't think that will be the case for the long term. And we're pretty excited about seeing like, sort of more credibly neutral modular bridges that will actually just create more like, you know, interstate highways, like, what bridges are actually meant to do.
00:12:49.334 - 00:13:05.124, Speaker C: And with that, I think, you know, where would people sort of pay, like, bridge operators, like, significant fees for that? I think we definitely think so, because at the end of the day, this is like, you know, zooming out. This is how, like, you know, the web3 world is supposed to look like.
00:13:05.284 - 00:13:08.344, Speaker A: Do you think that, you know, the credibly neutral bridge is possible?
00:13:09.604 - 00:13:11.104, Speaker C: Optimistically, yes.
00:13:13.204 - 00:13:33.604, Speaker B: I mean, IBC is a credibly neutral bridge, right? Because there's no, like, intermediary when you connect two chains with IBC, you have like chain A and chain b, the bridge security is equivalent to the security of the chains themselves, right? Because they're using these like, lite client proofs. And I don't think you can get really more credibly neutral than that.
00:13:34.464 - 00:14:21.044, Speaker A: And how do we deal with. There are so many bridges launching right now. One of the challenges with that is that you get fragmented liquidity. And so if you look within Solana, for example, today, you have so many different versions of USDC. You've got the native USDC and sometimes even double bridged USDC version one, version two. And so, you know, if you're a liquidity provider, that's okay because, you know, you can essentially farm the arbitrage, but for users outside of that, it's not so great because you essentially fragment even the underlying stablecoin. And so what are your thoughts around that? Do you think that is just something we're going to deal with and find a different way to abstract that? Or do you think that's a temporary solution that we will eventually sort of have more just better bridging solutions? So you don't have double bridge USDC, for example?
00:14:22.544 - 00:14:41.004, Speaker B: I think for now, I think things like Saber are the patch that helps solve that. Where if I have wormhole bridge USDC, I can quickly convert that to native Solana USDC pretty easily. But I imagine that over time.
00:14:42.724 - 00:14:43.012, Speaker A: The.
00:14:43.028 - 00:14:48.156, Speaker B: Problem is the UI layer is really good at doing that, but the protocol layers are not right.
00:14:48.220 - 00:15:14.222, Speaker D: I agree with that. I do think it's probably a user experience thing here. And it's always the choice between showing it to the user and showing what actual wrap token you have versus trying to hide that and then saying that it's just USDC outright, you have different wallets taking different approaches depending on the audience of users. And I mean, wait, so you think.
00:15:14.238 - 00:15:16.654, Speaker B: It'S better to show the user that there's different Ui?
00:15:16.774 - 00:15:34.086, Speaker D: I'm not claiming it's better either ways. I actually feel like it's better for different audiences depending on that particular audience. Like, if you're more mainstream, you're just getting into the space, you really don't care and you don't want to know you'd rather be it. If it's cheap, of course, automatically swapped behind the scenes.
00:15:34.190 - 00:15:34.406, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:34.430 - 00:15:41.254, Speaker D: If you're somebody who's experienced, you're dealing with a lot of money, that's. That's of course a different ballgame altogether.
00:15:41.874 - 00:16:15.514, Speaker A: Got it. So if we switch to. So, you know, we talked about sort of, there's going to be ten hundred thousands of chains, different ways these, there's going to be interoperability. And so if we get to the application space, which is really, you know, what people are going to care about on an everyday basis. Right. What are sort of the use cases that are enabled with improved cross chain compatibility? And also, you know, there are potentially use cases that we give up by enabling sort of super fluidity across change.
00:16:15.674 - 00:17:10.844, Speaker D: I mean ultimately I think it actually derives down to what the application itself is trying to provide to its users. For example, an application like Rarible, which is an NFT marketplace, is looking to present all NFTs and therefore, and that's experience they want to provide. They don't want it on one particular ecosystem, they want it on all of them. So for them they have to go cross chain. It's not whether or not it's regardless of cost, that's the idea that they're moving towards because they want to provide that whole experience to applications. But of course it's, I mean, it's always a implementation cost versus like the overall end experience. An application which just provides an ethereum experience or just a Solana experience or just a whatever experience may be more polished overall.
00:17:12.544 - 00:18:13.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's just like meme right now that going cross chain will like break composability, but I just don't know if that's really true. Right. You know, when you're building on a single chain, you get these like nice synchronous atomic transactions which are really nice from like a developer experience perspective, but they are kind of inherently unscalable. Right? Like at some point you're gonna hit the limits and you know, today writing asynchronous like blockchain applications is annoying. But here's the thing that was also annoying. To write like asynchronous web applications 15 years ago in JavaScript, you had to deal with that like callback hell and stuff. But like over time the tooling has just gotten better, right? Like the programming, like, you know, we have these awaits in JavaScript now and like, you know, the user experience and the developer tooling just gets better and better to the point that like writing asynchronous code for blockchains will be just as easy as writing synchronous code.
00:18:13.406 - 00:18:22.034, Speaker B: And so I don't think you're going to lose that sort of composability. I guess the only thing you do lose is flashlight loans, but we're working on solutions for that.
00:18:23.734 - 00:19:13.144, Speaker C: Yeah, I think like, you know, ultimately what Sunny's point is the right one, where there's quite a bit of composability fragmentation and liquidity fragmentation that happens cross chain that I don't think we've quite figured out yet. We might. So it's really the rationale like, you know, are you trying to bridge assets? You know, bridge liquidity? You know, I think they're definitely sort of like performance sort of trade offs, unlike different chains that people can achieve. But it really sort of belies the importance of having that, you know, credibly neutral bridge again, because people don't want to go on a bridge that, you know, can suddenly be turned off by a multi sig at the end of the day. And I think until we actually get to that level of decentralization that, you know, people actually start spending a bit more time on that. And we're excited to sort of see that because it's under principle of the philosophy of the developers in our space.
00:19:14.664 - 00:19:23.204, Speaker A: And so in terms of when do you think it kind of makes sense for an existing dapp to go cross chain?
00:19:25.704 - 00:19:53.070, Speaker D: I mean, again, it's just dependent on what they're trying to provide, right. It's all applications try to provide something to the end users. And if it's all NFT markets or if it's all loans on whichever cheapest, if it's a DeFi aggregator to give you the cheapest loan or the cheapest swap, then they gonna have to go cross chain. But it's. Yeah, I think it just boils down to use case ultimately.
00:19:53.102 - 00:20:15.692, Speaker A: Yeah. And so Zen, as someone at Taurus, you've built already BSc integrated with Kepler, which is cosmos wallet. So you've already spent quite a bit of time and now, you know, clearly working on Solana. And so, you know, how do you think about, you know, ux in a cross chain environment? As someone who's been kind of at the forefront of that?
00:20:15.868 - 00:21:49.944, Speaker D: So actually I do believe that Ux is a tool and actually a layer on top of all of your different chains, which can be the layer that you abstract, that lack of composability underneath on, for example, and for example, like your NFT marketplaces do this, your various different, your various different defi applications across different chains, like curvefinal, they do this and that UX level if conveyed to the user in because ultimately a lot of users don't really care what they're using. Sometimes, like underneath, some people do care a lot, but they're also your bulk of the crowd which care a little bit less. And ultimately, like if you're catering to that crowd which cares a little bit less you can use that Ux layer to just say, hey, it's on this number of blockchains. This is the aggregate amount, and this is where your assets lie, or something like that. And we've seen people go I both ways. We've seen a lot of our more successful ones are definitely more crypto UX centric, where because it's defi products and that was the main boom. But as NFTs and games have really started to churn out more and more, you're starting to see more and more applications go the other route towards that more mainstream user, that more casual users.
00:21:49.944 - 00:23:35.254, Speaker A: Yeah. So then if much of this complexity truly can be abstracted away from the end user, which arguably is where we need to be in a web3 world in order to sort of have that same seamless and just very easy experience of web two, then there's kind of that age old question, what is the value accrual model to l one s? Because if that ultimately gets abstraction to the background, then does that value come from just the cult like communities that exist around these l one s, irrespective of the sort of more functional utilitarian supply and demand for the, for the token? Is it something where, you know, if we can have a high enough percentage of the token staked and therefore illiquid, then the sort of utilitarian demand plus the cult is what drives value. Because there's a paper that was at least very prominent in the bitcoin maxi circles in 2017 about an incident institutional investors perspective on cryptocurrencies, and sort of advancing the argument that ETH should be worth $0.20. Because as kind of world computer utility would approach that, of the cost that it takes to rent space off of AWS. Now, clearly I think that just the facts of the world ETH is not worth $0.20. But yet I think there haven't been terribly cogent arguments as to how to think about the delta between twenty cents and four thousand five hundred dollars. So where do you see that going? As you know, necessarily, once you get a billion users, a lot of this will be abstracted away.
00:23:36.594 - 00:24:29.844, Speaker C: I think where we've seen with the l one s, and I think a lot of people almost underestimated l one the last couple years, the question is, will that sort of continue? Will we see more of them? Ultimately, I think it depends on what people are paying for. People aren't just paying for scarcity at the end of the day. They're also paying for data availability, for consensus, for execution and I think there are ways to sort of add in a lot of deflationary mechanisms into sort of like the token economy within l one s. And I think it's especially exciting and like, you know, sort of l ones like, you know, Cosmos and Polkadot, who have very, very different sort of architectures and design. So, you know, we'll have to see. But I'm not sure if I quite agree with that statement yet. I think we have some optionality there.
00:24:31.544 - 00:24:33.564, Speaker A: Do you have a perspective on that, Sunny?
00:24:34.424 - 00:25:08.594, Speaker D: So I think that. I think that we all want an ideal future where we can code an asynchronous code across all different blockchains. We can interact with one application and interact with the safest, the best, the fastest, the cheapest blockchain. And we all want that kind of like ideal future. Users don't want to have to think about this, obviously. They just want to buy their NFT product, their CD, they want to play their game. That's all they want to do.
00:25:08.594 - 00:26:09.744, Speaker D: And we can all. And maybe like 20 years down the line, we'll be there. But I think the core difference between building, you know, between building on an l one and an l two is probably like the infrastructure, the tooling, the ecosystem surrounding it, the support, everything else that comes, that is, it's actually very tangible. It's not intangible by any means, but it seems it's quite hard to quantify exactly what that is. I do think that ecosystem will surround, probably in particular, or that mind share will surround only a select few applications and chains which come out of it. To me, personally, I do believe that Solana is probably one of them. And, yeah, I think that's what is more important than talking about that ideal future 20 years down the line.
00:26:10.884 - 00:26:43.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the. Yeah, I don't know, I guess I'm a little bit of a skeptic on this, like, fat protocol thesis about l one s, unless the l one really tries to push for, like, high levels of moneyness. And, you know, I think bitcoin has done that. I think ETH has done that. I think, you know, Solana is, like, in the process of doing this, right, like, more things in the Solana ecosystem are starting to be denominated in Seoul. So, like, you know, your nfts are priced now in Seoul. And I think, like that, that's sort of really, if you want.
00:26:43.454 - 00:27:08.374, Speaker B: If you honestly, I think that I. The only layer one that I think has actually done fat protocol thesis correctly is terra, because what they. But it's because they started as a application specific chain, built an application, and then are now building an ecosystem on top of it that, like, leverages their original application. And so I think that, like, is the proper flywheel to be building.
00:27:08.994 - 00:28:48.584, Speaker A: Got it. And so if we switch gears for a second, there's been this ongoing kind of theme since, you know, really the beginning of blockchain, where I remember in 2015, you know, the nom de jour was private blockchains. Right. Because there's always been this somewhat comfortable, a little bit uncomfortable relationship with existing, whether it be web, two companies, Fortune 500 corporates that kind of see the potential but feel very uneasy with this, like, sort of radically open ecosystem that lives and breathes online, you know, around the world and oftentimes, you know, using language that wouldn't necessarily sort of be in a boardroom somewhere. Right. And so, you know, increasingly I feel like bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain went from being sort of the outlier to now being sort of on the main stage and, like the hottest kid at the party, which for me is personally a relief. But, you know, as we see, you know, second wave, the third wave of basically establishing institutions, getting into this, how do you think that is going to sort of be implemented given the technologies that we have and whether the technologies we have are sufficient? So is Facebook going to build on an existing chain, like a solana, right? Is Facebook going to build its own chain? I'm sorry, meta build its own chain? And those that experimented with the whole private blockchain world, the multiple solutions from IBM, where do you see them sort of slotting into the system, given that? I would say the thesis around open systems is once again prevailing.
00:28:51.244 - 00:30:04.514, Speaker D: So it's a tough question. I mean, I guess it depends with large enterprise chains which are coming out like meta, like, I don't know, whichever other foreseeable, like IBM or hyperledger chain comes out, or bank chain. I do think that it depends probably on the implementer, on how open they would like those specifications and how improperable they would want that to be with other chains in the grand ecosystem of things like bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana and everything which will come after, which has kind of come from a bottom up community effort always has that essence and that soul of interoperability, of being open, of like, you know, the developer spirit of open sourceness. But I do think that it's. It may be a little bit different for some, especially like maybe the government chains, right? Like the China one that may be coming out, I don't know, in particular, these ones may be a little bit more closed off.
00:30:05.774 - 00:31:11.574, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think they're, you know, when we kind of think back, like two years ago, right. Why do people want private blockchains? Like, privacy is not an inherent feature of blockchain. So, you know, there's some empathy for like, you know, just sensitive consumer data and experimentation and sandboxes and what else? But I think what, you know, we kind of have to focus on is the evolution. And I think a lot of enterprises will probably focus on the privacy bit and forget that, you know, they are sacrificing global liquidity and like, security and all the other benefits of having an open ecosystem. But some of them might, I think it'll be pretty cool, right, where you sort of trade off, like, okay, I can have a wall garden of all this, like, content and like, permissioned apps, or I can actually just, you know, choose to create a monetary system within this open protocol and the price might be larger there. You know, I do think some of the enterprises are wising up to, like, what they're trading off, but others will just sort of like, remain wall gardens because that's what they're comfortable with.
00:31:12.914 - 00:31:23.864, Speaker B: Yeah, I think them building these, their like, own chains, but in like an interoperable, like, ecosystem of chains is like a nice middle ground there.
00:31:24.324 - 00:31:59.060, Speaker A: Yeah. And so, you know, this move, the space moves at a mile a minute. And so there's a flurry of activity around interchange, compatibility, bridging. And what do you think is kind of the next topic that's going to arise in the ecosystem? Do you think it's going to be? I personally think that privacy is going to be a big one. Right. And also privacy as you bridge, I think is going to be a topic that comes up. I don't know if you agree with that thesis that, you know, privacy is sort of the next thing that we really need to think about in all of its various forms.
00:31:59.060 - 00:32:35.154, Speaker A: And also moving the narrative away from privacy is somehow you have something to hide, but rather just that. There is, you know, many legitimate reasons why you want to have privacy. You have your information, how you trade, and you don't necessarily want all of your trades to be totally transparent on etherscan or whatever it might be. And so I guess two part question, what do you think the next area of interest is going to be? We have these kind of themes that come up every three to six months as an industry. I guess first part question is that.
00:32:36.994 - 00:33:30.748, Speaker B: I think that. So, yeah, so I mean, I agree 100% on the privacy one, when we started osmosis, that was actually sort of our goal was like, how do we build a fully private Dex, or as practically private as is efficient? And actually, the first thing that we kind of, like, leaned into was, like, front running and Mev resistance. And I actually treat that as a type of privacy because frontrunning happens because of a lack of privacy at the mempool layer. The fact that everyone can read each other's transactions is a privacy failure, in my opinion. And so that's sort of what we've been working on on this. Like, we have something called threshold encryption, which we're working on as a way of encrypting all the transactions at the mempool layer. But then how this relates to cross chain is, I think this solution is really good for, like, single chain front running resistance.
00:33:30.748 - 00:33:52.752, Speaker B: But once you get into a world where transactions are happening cross chain, and, like, they do one thing on one chain, that triggers something on another chain, then you start to get some new Mev introduced again. And so I think the next step, you know, one of the things I'm thinking a lot about right now is, like, you know, while we're building our single chain front running resistance, how do we do cross chain Mev resistance?
00:33:52.908 - 00:34:19.044, Speaker A: Yeah. And so, Min, I don't know if you, if you would agree with my thesis that that's kind of the next large area that we need to figure out. And I think that will also be conveniently or inconveniently sort of coinciding with, you know, just ever more regulatory attention on this space. And there's, I think, a conflict point there. And so I don't know whether you think that is the next area, and if so, how you see that playing out.
00:34:19.404 - 00:35:25.542, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we, you know, we've been investing in privacy for the last couple years, and we'll continue to be investing in privacy for the next few years. And there are a lot of, you know, I think we remain very optimistic on ways to make that regulatory compliant as well, because ultimately it's protecting user data. And, like, you know, the optimists and me would like to believe that the regulator is aligned with, you know, that philosophy. You know, definitely agree on Sunny's point on where privacy breaks at the bridge, and we just don't really know on the bridging side how to actually enable sort of private cross chain communication. One thing that another area that we're spending a lot of time on is identity and reputation. I think it's a little bit of misnomer in the space, because identity sort of means ten to 15 different things from, like, a subcategory perspective. But ultimately, you know, being able to create personalized, contextual user experiences across applications, across, like, ecosystems, is super important.
00:35:25.542 - 00:35:50.704, Speaker C: I mean, I think there's this sort of obvious one of capital efficiency in defi, for sure. But I think as you get to nfts, like, you know, how do you actually make it more a more sort of enriching experience, like, you know, based on sort of user data, but doing so in a web3 native way, you know, we're spending a lot of time, like, you know, with teams who are innovating at the forefront of identity and also data availability and storage.
00:35:51.484 - 00:35:57.756, Speaker A: And so I imagine this is a topic that you think about quite a bit, because Taurus, you guys are. Yeah.
00:35:57.820 - 00:36:49.878, Speaker D: In particular, because we sit in between web two and web3, we do have faced that problem quite a bit. And I mean, it's interesting because while blockchains are so public, cryptography, which is the underlying fundamental aspect, encryption and all started with authentication, with privacy in mind, and we've evolved to this point. I think privacy has been a hot topic for a while, to be honest. And it has had huge advances with ZK proofs, as well as the MPC side with threshold encryption. I think things like Aztec are pretty cool as well. Big fans of them, and I'm only hopeful for the future in terms of technology and optimizations that can help us get to the point where we can hide what we want to hide and show what we want to show. And I do think it's a big problem.
00:36:49.878 - 00:36:51.274, Speaker D: We need to solve it.
00:36:52.414 - 00:37:04.096, Speaker A: All right, well, I think we might be at the end of our time slot. Do you have any sort of closing thoughts or closing, given that we are at the sort of Solana conference? No. Good.
00:37:04.120 - 00:37:12.644, Speaker B: I'm just really excited about Solana and I think just all the scaling innovation that's been going on within the Solana ecosystem, I'm just really excited about it.
00:37:14.184 - 00:37:29.924, Speaker D: Honestly, the vibe here has just been fantastic. Breakpoint is supposed to be a celebration, and it really feels that way. It's crazy. My teammates are here and we can't even get tickets as well, so it's fantastic.
00:37:30.824 - 00:37:45.240, Speaker C: Likewise. I mean, it's been such a pleasure speaking with so many developers here and look forward to talking to more. Very excited about the neon launch and I think all the cross chain use cases we'll see there. So I think it'll be an exciting next few days.
00:37:45.392 - 00:37:47.784, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much. Cheers.
