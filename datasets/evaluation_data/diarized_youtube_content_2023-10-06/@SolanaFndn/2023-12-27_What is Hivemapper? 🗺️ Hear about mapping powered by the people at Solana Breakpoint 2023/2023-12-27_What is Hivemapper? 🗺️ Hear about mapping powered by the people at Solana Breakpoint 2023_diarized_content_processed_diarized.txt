00:00:00.200 - 00:00:29.978, Speaker A: This is a quick overview of some really cool projects. You guys can check these out more on your own. Hivemapper is Solana native. Basically, if you look at Google Maps, they're deploying vehicles that cost about a million dollars full of all kinds of interesting spatial and imaging referencing devices. But you can only deploy million dollar vehicles so fast and in so many locations, and there are certain locations that are basically too dangerous to deploy them at all. So what happens is that the refresh rate on the maps is very bad. It's very poor, it's not being updated very often.
00:00:29.978 - 00:00:42.954, Speaker A: So what if you put these dash cams inside of all the ubers and bolts out there to get real time data? That's refreshing on a daily basis so that your maps are way more up to date. You incentivize those drivers through honey tokens, through crypto.
