00:00:00.280 - 00:00:25.658, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's episode of the Solana Changelog, where I'm joined by Jacob and Joe, and we discuss the changes in the Solana dev ecosystem over the past week, which rolls into, we actually hit a major milestone, which is 100 billion transactions on the Solana network. So. Yep. And I'm hoping there will be 100 billion more to come. And over to proposals. Jacob, what do we have for this week?
00:00:25.846 - 00:01:23.810, Speaker B: Yes, so there's actually a change coming up soon that is extending your program data account. So right now, whenever you create or deploy a program, your data count is very much set to the amount of data on chain that you originally set. So, like, say your program is 2 kb, you can't change it. So if you add things to your program that is above 2 kb, you can't redeploy the program to the same address. If you remember recently there was realloc added to just regular accounts. This is extending realloc to also be used with program accounts so that like, hey, you make some massive change, you go from a hello world to some options contract or something, you can actually extend it and you pay as you go versus pay upfront, a large cost in case you increase there. So, yeah, that's a really cool proposal.
00:01:23.810 - 00:01:30.898, Speaker B: And change coming up soon on Solana. What commits have you seen, Joe, that were interesting this past week?
00:01:31.066 - 00:01:56.674, Speaker C: Yeah. So we've got two SPL related commits that I thought were kind of cool. So the first one is the account compression for the J's library has actually been added. So that was put in. You can check out that pull request that was merged, and then also the token 2022 support was added to the SBL token CLI. So you can now do like, interactions with that program from the terminal. So pretty cool stuff right there.
00:01:56.674 - 00:02:00.662, Speaker C: So how about some resource highlights? Would you guys maybe see?
00:02:00.758 - 00:02:23.394, Speaker A: So one thing that caught my eye was the Seahorse examples from the super team now. And just again, Seahorse is a framework on Solana that allows you to write programs, aka smart contracts with Python. So now they have like a bunch of examples of, like some example programs for any Python devs out there to get started.
00:02:24.054 - 00:03:04.924, Speaker B: Really cool. And then I also saw that there was something from the nil foundation that allows you to verify state in kind of like a light client for Solana, which is really cool. So state, usually whenever you want to try to verify it, you have to know everything in the past up until that specific point in time. So that's really hard to do with Solana because Solana generates some insane amount of state every minute. So what this does with nilfoundation, they've generated a way to do it with zero knowledge proofs in order to verify a state at a specific time period in less than five minutes, which is really cool.
00:03:05.044 - 00:03:16.284, Speaker C: Wow. Well, I think that is actually it. So a lot of exciting new changes again. Another week, another changelog, and we will actually catch you guys next week for even more changes. Thanks for coming.
