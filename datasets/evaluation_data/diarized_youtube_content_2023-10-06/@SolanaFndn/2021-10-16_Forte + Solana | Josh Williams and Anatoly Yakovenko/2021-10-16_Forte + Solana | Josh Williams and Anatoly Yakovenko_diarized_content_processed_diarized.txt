00:00:19.080 - 00:00:42.878, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, this is anatoly, and you guys are watching us do a twitch stream on gaming for the ignition hackathon. So one of the coolest folks in gaming and crypto is joining us. Josh from forte. Awesome for you to be here. Love to know your origin story, how you got into crypto, how you got into gaming.
00:00:43.046 - 00:00:59.036, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. It's nice to be here. Always love when I get a chance to talk with you. Totally. So thanks for lining this up. Yeah. At forte, you know, trying to help pull the future forward with, with watching games.
00:00:59.036 - 00:01:45.884, Speaker B: Um, and for me, I've been in, in games for a long time, and before that I was in fintech, actually. So it's kind of a good combo of the, of the two things. Um, and, uh, you know, been working with and, you know, playing around with researching sort of blockchain technology for six or seven years. And we started forte about, um, four years ago. So, um, so, yeah, for me, you know, the idea was I got into games because, like, as a kid, I was a nerd and, you know, loved math. And when I got it, I saved up my newspaper route money to buy a computer at like a 286. It was just like old one at the time, you know, and I wanted to make games and so I, like, taught myself programming, you know, I think it's a common story.
00:01:45.884 - 00:02:01.690, Speaker B: And, and anyway, so that's how I got into it. And then, you know, kind of got, you know, lucky meeting cool people and kind of getting into, into games and building some cool companies and. Yeah, actually, like, kind of stumbled my way into startups and fintech.
00:02:01.722 - 00:02:12.098, Speaker A: Before that, I shoveled snow in Chicago. I got a 75 MHz, like Pentium with like, windows 95 on it.
00:02:12.146 - 00:02:13.494, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:02:14.354 - 00:02:15.494, Speaker A: It's funny.
00:02:15.994 - 00:02:23.676, Speaker B: When you were first starting out, how did you. I guess. How did you, like, what did, what did you first learn to, to code on? Like, what languages were you messing with?
00:02:23.780 - 00:02:29.492, Speaker A: C was like, the language was the first one that I started coding and then we had like, a class in high school.
00:02:29.668 - 00:02:30.636, Speaker B: Yeah, nice.
00:02:30.820 - 00:02:40.020, Speaker A: It was optional, so although it was just the nerds Borland, I think, the Borland compiler.
00:02:40.092 - 00:02:45.504, Speaker B: Turbo C. Yeah, Turbo C. Yeah. Nice. Yeah, awesome.
00:02:46.084 - 00:02:58.664, Speaker A: My first experience with a game was we had this assignment to build and AI for like, it was snake, right, but basically called the Tron where you like, create a line.
00:02:58.784 - 00:03:00.000, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.
00:03:00.112 - 00:03:08.512, Speaker A: But the teacher made it like a versus game. So your algorithm to detect where ran against the other one.
00:03:08.608 - 00:03:09.712, Speaker B: Oh, that is awesome.
00:03:09.848 - 00:03:32.828, Speaker A: Yeah, I built like a greedy one that always ran away from, like, pick whatever was the open space was. That worked really well. And that was like the first time I had like this like eureka moment. Oh, okay. This is like AI environment. Like it's just like I can observe the world in this like very weird way.
00:03:32.956 - 00:03:33.684, Speaker B: Totally.
00:03:33.804 - 00:03:34.828, Speaker A: Take action.
00:03:34.996 - 00:03:37.784, Speaker B: Yeah, that's so awesome. That's super cool.
00:03:38.644 - 00:03:57.684, Speaker A: Yeah, that like loop, right? You like how if you ever like built a game, like there's always like an event loop that you discover and it's so weird to think of it as like one detecting one photon and then taking action on it in this instrumental way. Just do it fast enough. It looks real.
00:03:57.804 - 00:04:09.108, Speaker B: Yeah, totally, man. Totally. Yeah, that's right. That's right. And then for you, I mean, like, how'd you go from that to blockchain? I know you spent a lot of time at Qualcomm and doing real low level work.
00:04:09.156 - 00:04:54.694, Speaker A: Yeah, well, sure. Well, this is supposed to be your origin story, but like we'll do mine. I ended up kind of being a nerd in high school and like hanging out with folks. We started building Linux from scratch and like messing around with operating systems. And I got into college and because I already knew kind of how to code, I skipped some classes, the entry level ones, and went straight into the kind of the mid level like classes, and started working on a startup to do voiceover ip. Like what if we connected like old school phone lines and build stuff around it, but unfortunately no business sense. I didn't realize that you could just say this is now on the web and it's global and raise a bunch of money.
00:04:54.694 - 00:05:27.176, Speaker A: We were trying to build boxes and bootstrap it and.com crash wiped all semblance of being able to do that for real. No doubt. But Qualcomm was using the same stack to go build their voice therapy stuff. So got hired and ended up just like geeking out on instruction sets for arm and cycles and making stuff faster and. Yeah, actually like, yeah, my second experience with gaming was like on brew, which is the first mobile platform.
00:05:27.280 - 00:05:27.816, Speaker B: Totally.
00:05:27.880 - 00:05:35.656, Speaker A: And getting the blit engine, the 2d blit engine to work with alpha blending that.
00:05:35.720 - 00:05:50.372, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. That's awesome, man. That's really cool. Yeah, well, yeah, voip and kind of signal processing, broadcasting data like pretty direct path there today. Yeah.
00:05:50.548 - 00:05:58.796, Speaker A: So when like the blockchain boom happened, I was like, oh yeah, this is a resource constrained operating system. Kind of like a flip phone in the nineties.
00:05:58.900 - 00:06:20.104, Speaker B: I know this. Yeah, yeah, I know this stuff. Yeah, totally. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. For me, I think around with programming in high school, I actually got to work at my school district and do a bunch of programming stuff and figure out some, all kinds of things.
00:06:20.104 - 00:07:20.076, Speaker B: It's the early days of computers being deployed broadly in it systems and stuff. I don't know everything from how should we route buses to pick up kids for field trips, trying to write programs for that. Similarly, you write like a greedy algorithm, and even though you didn't know that was what it was called at the time, you're just like, it's the only thing that works. And then, yeah, I kind of stumbled my way into, I didn't know what startups were. I didn't grow up in the Silicon Valley or anything, but, but ended up creating a company that did fintech. I was super into math as a kid, and for some reason I was into like, stocks. And even though we had no money or anything, or just love to read about it, and meeting this guy, we ended up forming a company together that basically was early in fintech and in the digitization of financial data streams and making those available on the Internet.
00:07:20.076 - 00:08:03.978, Speaker B: And so we created a company that basically sold data streams with automated pricing recommendations around mispriced options and stuff. So we sold to market makers, institutional investors, hedge funds, kind of grew it big, but it was crazy because there was no distributed computing anything at the time. So to process, like, these big sets of data, we were daisy chaining motherboards together by their serial ports and writing assembly and trying to make things perform. And so it was cool. Yeah. And then from there I got super burnt out, actually. Didn't feel like, didn't know if I was doing anything like, you know, that worthwhile or meaningful.
00:08:03.978 - 00:08:56.762, Speaker B: Actually, when I, you know, got my head wrapped around it, it was, you know, good business. But, um, but yeah, I just kind of want to always make games and got involved with these guys who made a bunch of games who, that I loved playing when I was a kid. And, um, they had this, they were forming this company, um, and I joined and became CEO and CTo of that too. And, um, it was called garage games. And we were all about like enabling indie game developers, like small game developers in the early two thousands, like 2002, 2003, right, when games are kind of going from this like very, I guess, you know, like a blockchain parlance, centralized industry with like twelve publishers around the world that like, controlled all the retail distribution. And, you know, games are kind of stagnating like a bunch of sequels and whatever. And so, you know, the thought was, hey, like the Internet, like you could just directly distribute games to users and to players.
00:08:56.762 - 00:09:13.714, Speaker B: And actually, if we could just like give people technology, given like a game engine, a way for them to more easily build games, then, like, kind of could get games back to, you know, only takes three, four, five, you know, maybe ten people to, to build a cool game. And, and so, yeah, so we kind of built an engine to do that.
00:09:14.254 - 00:09:19.270, Speaker A: I feel like we were so close to like an Internet based platform at that time.
00:09:19.342 - 00:09:20.358, Speaker B: Totally, man.
00:09:20.526 - 00:09:34.074, Speaker A: Mobile happened and like ruined everything. I mean, I helped, I like, I helped mobile out. I didn't realize at the time that like, it was just going to be such a lock in system.
00:09:34.454 - 00:10:21.756, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess that's the bummer thing. And one of the cool things about blockchain is, I guess, web one and two has been we create these open protocols and open standards, which is great, but there's no economics associated with it. And so you get these network effect cycles kick in and they're broadly distributed. And what that ends up resulting in is people can sort of leverage the network effects and build a network that's highly entrenched and then start extracting value from it. What's cool about blockchain stuff is a way to associate value with an open protocol and then socialize costs, socialize benefits. I don't know. For me, that's part of what was cool about blockchain in general.
00:10:21.756 - 00:11:20.374, Speaker B: And then games and blockchain was just, you know, if you want blockchains to sort of be a big part of the future and for that to happen as soon as possible, then games are just such a natural fit for it because like, one, there's 3 billion people that play games around the world. You know, it's the largest kind of consumer category besides social media and instant messaging. And, you know, it's the only one that isn't totally locked up by, you know, a bunch of monopolies, basically. And then, and then also, you know, just the consumer, like player behavior makes sense. Like players, most players already buy virtual goods and virtual currencies and so kind of like the mental model shift is just super tiny to hop from what players already do in games today to like, oh, I'm doing the same thing. I'm buying virtual currencies, I'm buying virtual goods, but now I just actually own them and like maybe there's an open market around them. So, you know, that was for me like several years ago, sort of the thought between, like, you know, behind wanted to do forte and make it happen.
00:11:20.374 - 00:11:40.154, Speaker B: And six or seven years ago we were just doing research on, is this ever going to be scalable at real mass market with tens of millions, hundreds of millions, hopefully billions of users. How far away is that? And we thought about four years ago, we thought, okay, it's on the horizon. In three, four, five years, it'll be right there. I think that's roughly right. We're getting there.
00:11:42.014 - 00:12:08.594, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah. That's awesome. I love, I love, man, everybody in the space right now, I think is because they ran up to an intermediary. That sucked. Yeah, for me it was actually trading. I also got into stocks and numbers because I'm a math guy engineer and there's this temptation to build a money machine.
00:12:08.594 - 00:12:23.584, Speaker A: I can track all these patterns and stuff, but when you, when you start doing it, you realize that in traditional finance there's ten people between you and where the Martin, the market and all want to take a little bit and then you get nothing.
00:12:23.704 - 00:13:26.420, Speaker B: That's right. That's right, man. Yeah, that problem's just got worse and worse, you know, with time. So, yeah, I thought, you know, it would be cool, I mean, whatever you want to talk about. But just for, you know, maybe folks that are interested in games and game developers that might tune into this now or later, I thought it'd be interesting to talk some more about Solana and maybe some of the technicals behind it. At forte, we're trying to make it easy for game developers who maybe already have existing games, existing player bases, or developers who are interested in creating new games to just leverage blockchain technology and create good player experiences that just kind of work out of the box and like get them to really scale. And so, you know, I think it's good for developers to wrap their heads around how the underlying kind of backend systems, basically like the data stores and the low level kind of user defined functions for blockchain smart contracts can work.
00:13:26.420 - 00:14:11.610, Speaker B: And our view is like each, there's some blockchains that just kind of don't have a reason to exist. Maybe they're copycatting things, maybe they don't like, you know, they don't have any sort of fundamental technology or big differentiators. But then there is this big space of protocol definition and fundamental architectural trade offs that you make when you're defining a blockchain protocol. The idea of the protocol is we have an open database that's permissionless and it's got safety. So every transaction is valid or is validated and some semblance of liveness. Every valid transaction gets included. Um, and so that's awesome.
00:14:11.610 - 00:14:37.334, Speaker B: It's actually was a dream for a long time in distributed computing. How do you have a big open database? And, and the idea with games is cool. You can put some of your items, some of your economy, in this big open database that opens up maybe a market around it. It gives players ownership. But, like, how do you implement that? There's a bunch of trade off dimensions to. To think about. And, you know, I think you did an awesome job thinking about things in Solana from first principles and sort of looking at, like, you know, okay, we want to have a.
00:14:37.334 - 00:14:59.350, Speaker B: A single sharded system so that data is highly available to all the user defined functions. And we have a good low level programmers view of resource allocation and management and deploying code like elfs to LLVM and whatever. So if you could walk through that.
00:14:59.462 - 00:15:09.728, Speaker A: Yeah, so it really kind of starts from the, um, the physical layer, right? Like, almost from the silicon itself. You only have so much space in that chip.
00:15:09.856 - 00:15:10.208, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:10.256 - 00:15:55.148, Speaker A: And, um, when you look at something like a, like an arm processor for, like, normal programs, by normal, I mean programs that take a lot of branches and have a lot of state dependencies. Hey, like, I may read this address. I may read this, this register to get an address to go pull up a new place to jump to, and that may change every time I read it because of how the program operates. And that means it's unpredictable, and it's really hard to optimize that code. So that is like, what your cpu does. But what's interesting is that GPU's are far more computationally efficient for the amount of space that they get. But that's because the programs are structured such that everything is known ahead of time.
00:15:55.148 - 00:16:28.364, Speaker A: So you tell this thing, okay, I actually don't. You don't need to decode these addresses dynamically here. All the addresses I'm going to read, and they're layered in a row, and you know that you can start prefetching and doing all the stuff. And then the code that's operating across all these memory cells, that never changes. It's static code that just churns through this. So that really was, like, was baked into my head from working on arm and dsps and, like, GPU's at Qualcomm. And I kind of know just those trade offs at this point.
00:16:28.364 - 00:16:33.024, Speaker A: Instinctively, I can, like, almost visualize the area that is.
00:16:34.804 - 00:16:36.140, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, totally.
00:16:36.332 - 00:16:56.570, Speaker A: So, so when you get to that point, and, like, I saw the. This thing as a very constrained environment. Like, it. You only have one blockchain, one supercomputer. And if you shard it especially. I was coming from finance. You're creating arbitrage and different markets, and that obviously has some advantages.
00:16:56.570 - 00:17:46.452, Speaker A: You sharded and you have, now you have different markets, but there's an obvious advantage. What if you only had one giant marketplace without any sharding, I think should actually have better pricing for the world. So how do we build that thing? Started really from that perspective and decided to well, if we have this one massive supercomputer that everyone's using, then you got to start from the most efficient computational environment. This is this really hard to program constraint, like runtime, where you have code that is static. You write it once, it doesn't have any state, so it's just pure bytecode. Then it operates over memory that is predefined, so it's known ahead of time. This is where a transaction format comes from, where each transaction knows which memory is going to read, which memory is going to write.
00:17:46.452 - 00:18:11.458, Speaker A: Once you have that, then it's easy to optimize and parallelize. And I think, like you said, when is this stuff going to be really fast? I think probably within four years, you're going to see a very boring looking Solana box that sits next to your Cisco switch. And it's the thing that maybe you plug in storage, because that's easy to scale that, but that's the thing that runs the protocol, just moves packets in and out as fast as it can.
00:18:11.596 - 00:18:29.550, Speaker B: Totally, totally. Yeah. And I think, you know, one of the things, um, you know, all blockchains today, but you guys did a really good job optimizing for, is basically how to make writes, you know, efficient. The, the read, you know, layer is sort of a totally different problem.
00:18:29.702 - 00:18:31.862, Speaker A: Yes, we're giving that problem to you.
00:18:31.958 - 00:18:39.212, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, exactly. We try to help it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. But, you know, it comes down to you. You know, the way you described it.
00:18:39.212 - 00:19:29.676, Speaker B: Right? Like, if you're going to make reads efficient, then you do notice you need to understand, like, what is memory layout? And, you know, for me, what's part of the reason to kind of dive into this level of detail is game developers, at least in the old days, but even still with, you know, a lot of game engines and middleware, um, have to be super familiar with this stuff. You know, like, games are really hard software to, to write, actually. Like, um, you know, games today have all the kind of like web scale problems, cloud computing, distributed computing, you know, things. But also you have this like, really fat client in many games, even like mobile games, where you got to do like rendering and physics simulation. And besides that, besides like all the software complexity. Oh, and it's got to work like often in real time around the world. And so you got a lot of networking and how do you actually have really consensus, you know, between a server and a bunch of different clients.
00:19:29.676 - 00:19:48.474, Speaker B: And it's tough, but besides that, like it's got to be fun and there's a bunch of art so it's just hard stuff to, to build. And I think it's great as game developers look more and more at blockchain to understand some of the fundamental trade offs of the underlying l one s.
00:19:50.494 - 00:20:34.064, Speaker A: Yeah, this is, I think people when they ask me could you run Twitter on top of a blockchain? The answer is both yes and no. Sure, we can handle 5000 writes per second. Yeah, but like you still need to build all the exact same infra that Twitter builds to cache, to structure the visual representation of that data to actually make it like useful. And like that part is probably, I would honestly say that like if you were going to build Twitter right now, you'd probably use a write optimized like queue like Solana or Kafka that has high consistency and availability. And then you do all the same stuff that Twitter does anyway. So the cost is the same.
00:20:34.224 - 00:21:05.864, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. And I think it's, you know, I don't think a lot of developers in general, like web two developers or game developers understand that today. But it's actually a pretty simple, from a tech perspective, pretty simple mental model shift to make. But then you get all this exogenous benefit from kind of making that leap. And you know, now things are using this open protocol in an open network and that enables you to do things like let people own whatever, whatever you want to call them, but tokens and virtual currencies, virtual goods and have an open market around those things.
00:21:06.324 - 00:21:49.016, Speaker A: Yeah. What I really like, I think that's really unique is the cryptography aspect of it that you can actually like. People with cryptography, right? They can just coordinate using that as their identity. You as a developer, you kind of start abstract the account and human out of it and you're just like, don't stop caring about the tracking a person because fine, use whatever public key you want. Doesn't really matter how many accounts you create, right? Like every, everything ends up being identified through this opaque thing which I think makes designing like social networks and gaming environments I think, a lot easier.
00:21:49.160 - 00:22:41.924, Speaker B: Totally, totally. I think that's right. And maybe that ties to some of the sort of consensus trade offs that different, and the different guarantees that different blockchains make, too. The fundamental innovation with bitcoin, initially with proof of work, was in order to solve simple attacks, you basically introduce a cost to try to write to the database or to propose a block. And so that means you don't change anything about the old impossibility proofs around consensus in distributed permissionless systems. But you do basically a game theoretic guarantee about consensus in these systems. And then I think, kind of jumping off from bitcoin, there's now proof of stake systems.
00:22:41.924 - 00:23:06.884, Speaker B: And Solana's got a version of that, along with really some innovative stuff around, essentially vdfs and ways to timestamp with proof of history and stuff. So maybe if you could talk about that. I love that you guys think we agree with this, obviously biased, but I think there's a multi chain sort of world, at least for the foreseeable future. And so, yeah, I mean, if you could talk about that layer of it too, I think it'd be helpful for developers to understand.
00:23:07.044 - 00:23:49.334, Speaker A: Yeah, the cool thing, what's really different about Solana is it's a real time system. And that, again, probably because I spent a career qualcomm, this is how I think of the world. And real time actually depends on a consistent time source for all the participants that are activating their actions on a particular cycle. Right, in a particular signal shift or a clock cycle. And this is really easy to do in, like, normal wireless networking because the FTC says that if you don't comply with the protocol, they'll literally send a van out to shut you down. So we don't have any vans. So.
00:23:51.314 - 00:23:52.058, Speaker B: How do we do?
00:23:52.106 - 00:24:42.790, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a little harder, but we have cryptography, and that's a really cool thing. So when I had my eureka moment in 2017, I had, like this, two coffees and a beer, as the legend goes. And I couldn't sleep because what I realized was that there's a way to encode passage of time as a data structure. And if you've ever studied math and physics, you know that there is no mathematical representation of time, right? There's no way to encode and say, this is the era of time. And it's such a kind of core problem that I just really couldn't sleep for like a week, and I couldn't find anybody else working on this stuff because I just didn't know what to google for. I googled for a bunch of things and couldn't find it. But, like, Dan Bonet and a bunch of other folks have been working on vdfs forever, and there's called RSA time locks.
00:24:42.790 - 00:25:04.438, Speaker A: I think I would have found these amazing people at that time. I probably wouldn't have started Solana, because I was like, oh, I don't. I don't have anything new. There's already people that are, like, generations ahead of me on, like, really hardcore cryptography. So that that was like, just some luck that, like, kind of, you know.
00:25:04.566 - 00:25:05.950, Speaker B: The Google foo failed.
00:25:06.062 - 00:25:52.494, Speaker A: Yeah, the Google failed enough to where it shoved me out the door. And once I kind of had the pressure to like, okay, what am I actually going to do and build? Started talking to my buddies from Qualcomm, and it just kind of became obvious that our experience in building high performance systems and protocols is really, like, unique to the space that there were really no other teams that had that kind of background. So we decided to go for it and the protocol kind of came out. It's really hard to design this stuff in a week. So it took solid two years for us to get to a BFT solution. We thought it was going to get it done in a year, but literally.
00:25:53.114 - 00:25:58.574, Speaker B: Engineering timelines times two is pretty good, man. That's pretty good.
00:25:59.794 - 00:26:35.848, Speaker A: We realized what became clear is that source of time is what is really important in these systems is in selecting who gets to produce a block when. And if you go back to radio, you should remember that two radio towers transmit signal at the same time or the same frequency, you get noise because that signal interferes. Same problem as two block producers. To produce a block at the same time, you get a fork. And now that's interference for the entire network, logically. Right? So if you could alternate them by time, if there was some way to force them to go one at a time, a gap.
00:26:35.896 - 00:26:36.524, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:36.944 - 00:26:58.470, Speaker A: That's effectively what that VDF provides, is that when we create this leader schedule, instead of using this random puzzle solver, that proof of work is there's a deterministic solver, but it deterministically forces everybody to solve it in a particular delay. So that's really, that really trick that the network does with vdfs.
00:26:58.542 - 00:27:01.074, Speaker B: Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, yeah.
00:27:01.934 - 00:27:27.912, Speaker A: And like, you know, I think we can, you know, right now that that's set to 400 milliseconds, as we were optimizing, it's becoming clear that I think it can be down to 200. And then probably every ten milliseconds after that is going to be some blood, sweat and tears, but it really feels like we can get to the time it takes for information to travel halfway around the world is about 120 milliseconds.
00:27:27.968 - 00:27:33.256, Speaker B: You can kind of get there. That's the theoretical limit, basically. Yeah, totally, totally, totally. Makes sense.
00:27:33.360 - 00:27:48.806, Speaker A: That would be super cool. That would really be a system where state transitions through this, like, single global supercomputer travel at the speed of news. Yeah, that's right. Then information in this supercomputer is as good as any other market outside of it.
00:27:48.910 - 00:28:06.794, Speaker B: That's right. And yeah, in time, back to what you said earlier, what we talked about, because it's single sharded. Like, all that news gets to everyone at the same time. If you're paying attention at least, and, you know, everyone who's participating in the transformations or the market or whatever, nobody has any advantage.
00:28:07.094 - 00:28:20.914, Speaker A: All you need is hardware to plug in. Even if that hardware costs $5,000 a year or 10,000 a year, it's a lot cheaper than what CME charges for data, what nobody else charges. Yeah, a thousand times cheaper.
00:28:21.494 - 00:28:33.966, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. And there's not a, like a kind of monopoly intermediary. Right. So besides, whatever they choose to charge for rent today, it could be different tomorrow. And that's like a more fundamental type of problem.
00:28:34.030 - 00:28:52.374, Speaker A: And they choose who gets to. To even pay them. And that is like, the core. The core part of it was that, like, as a me, as like a hobbyist, I couldn't get access. Like, there was no, like, student, like, rate that they're like, go mess around until do not have that attitude at all.
00:28:52.994 - 00:29:05.672, Speaker B: Right. It's variegated. Yeah, totally, totally. Yeah. It's awesome to walk. To walk through that stuff, man. Again, I think it's, you know, like, so games, or I feel, like, really adjacent to the blockchain technology space.
00:29:05.672 - 00:29:37.392, Speaker B: Even though a lot of game developers today don't actually fully realize that, like, when they dig in, you know, listen to you talk and dig into the technology, I think it becomes more and more clear. Like, even things like proof of work and, you know, the denial of service mitigation. Right. Like, there was games actually adopted. Yeah, I guess, you know, back in the day was, it was, you know, client puzzles. Basically. It was like re jewels and, you know, like, you guys use BPM Berkeley protocol format, and so much good stuff came out of Berkeley.
00:29:37.392 - 00:30:29.762, Speaker B: I think Ari was at like a postdoc at Berkeley at the time, came up with client puzzles, which actually we adopted at garage games pretty early on to basically do things for real time games where gamers will find every way to hack a system and exploit or whatever. A common thing that would happen in the early days of multiplayer gaming is someone would be in a competitive match and maybe get behind and they're like a little bit tech savvy and they would just blow up the server by opening up too many connections and sort of the match would end. They wouldn't have a loss on their record. It's like, it sucks, but it would happen all the time. So we see the research from academia with client puzzles and denial service of denial of a service attack mitigation. And so you can introduce that into the game before you form a connection. You got to reverse the hash.
00:30:29.762 - 00:31:05.684, Speaker B: You do a little client puzzle and like, okay, cool. It's a, it's a mitigative step. It doesn't, like, fully solve it. But now that guy who doesn't want to lose the match has to actually spin up a bunch of cpu somewhere, pay some money, and probably is not going to do it. And so I think games sort of think about consensus denial of service attacks, like, what is actually a valid state for a pretty complex set of states and state transitions a lot. Um, and so, you know, it's just so analogous to sort of the problems you and others that have had to solve in the blockchain space.
00:31:07.184 - 00:31:16.648, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah, it is. It is very similar, like, and it's this problem of civil, civil resistance. Social networks have to deal with this all the time.
00:31:16.776 - 00:31:17.444, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:18.344 - 00:31:31.596, Speaker A: Do you think, like, gaming as a, as it evolves, like, especially with crypto, is going to be more of a, like, social experience first? Yeah, like an individual, like one?
00:31:31.780 - 00:32:39.770, Speaker B: I definitely do. I mean, I think broadly that's happening in games, you know, already and even in largely single player games, like, you know, popular ones like Animal Crossing or something, you know, it's mostly like you play on your own, you manage this little virtual island, and you customize it and you get stuff in the game and, but, like, you know, you can introduce these social layers where people can, like, go check out your media island, you check out theirs, and like, it sort of becomes social. And then, you know, what's cool about these systems? We've wrote some pieces on, on this, but, like, anytime you get people together socially, like, they end up actually wanting to trade with each other. It's like a human thing. Like, even when you don't have, like, money or a concept of that, right. You just like, sort of end up trading favors, like, hey, could you watch my kid? And then, like, I'll watch yours later or whatever, you know? Um, so people want to trade and like, that happens even in these mostly single player games today when there's even a little bit of a social layer, like a way for people to interconnect. And even when the game, like, explicitly pushes out, like you can't trade with, there's no way to trade with, you know, with people or, you know, there's no real money involved or, or whatever.
00:32:39.770 - 00:33:02.970, Speaker B: And it's actually against the terms of service of the game or whatever. People still want to trade and still want to trade with some real money. And so, like, like, you know, like these sort of gray markets and black markets emerge. And there's one in animal, there's one in that game called Nuka Zombie on. And it's like, you know, people basically like, go weed each other's islands, you know, and like create little small businesses to do that. So. So anyways, I guess, long winded answer to like, yeah, definitely.
00:33:02.970 - 00:33:48.134, Speaker B: I think games would get more social in general. And then, like, definitely when there's a semblance of I have an identity I can carry across, you know, games and I can hit be pseudonymous, you know, if I want to, if I choose to or not. And then there's like a market economy, kind of like property rights where people own stuff in games and can trade goods and services with each other. Like, definitely, you know, games will get more and more social and like, sort of as players come to want to really own stuff and trade with each other, I think they're going to demand more and more, like guarantees of their property rights, which sort of necessitates that all their properties sit in one central database, you know, like it's in an open ledger. And so that's where I think the blockchain stuff comes in.
00:33:48.474 - 00:34:01.164, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I remember playing Ultima online. This is my kind of first massive game. And like, I bought like, digital items with like a cashier's check that I would mail.
00:34:01.284 - 00:34:05.588, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, right, totally, totally, yeah.
00:34:05.676 - 00:34:08.420, Speaker A: Then I sold my EverQuest character on eBay.
00:34:08.572 - 00:34:34.169, Speaker B: Totally, yeah. You know, you're not supposed to, but also you gotta do it. Yeah, totally, yeah. And it's from a games industry perspective, that's a, you know, it's both a problem and an opportunity. Right. Like any popular game, you end up with these black and gray markets, which is like a problem to deal with. There's also a problem because even if you wanted to embrace those things, actually you're squarely in the territory.
00:34:34.169 - 00:35:14.860, Speaker B: Like, if you embraced it, you're squarely in the territory of money transmission. And games are global and so you're actually commuting value around the world. And so it's really hard to build like a system actually where you can go back and audit transactions or you know, see all the ins and outs. And so that's actually part of what blockchains help, you know, make easier, uh, as well, um, over time. And, and then the opportunity is like, you know, games today, like players today spend um, about $200 billion a year in games. And most of that is on like iaps and in app purchases and virtual goods. And you know, those are pure expenditures today.
00:35:14.860 - 00:35:37.702, Speaker B: Like it's just people taking money out of their wallet and like knowing that theyre not going to get it back most likely. And so its like a pure entertainment expenditure. And from a developer perspective, its great. The games industry has grown a lot. Its pretty big. Its $200 billion a year, a couple trillion in market cap. But they certainly only have one way to make money today, which is to merchandise those goods and get the pure expenditures.
00:35:37.702 - 00:36:52.810, Speaker B: The cool thing about blockchains and blockchain gaming is it opens up what kinds of new revenue streams for developers where they can shift from being like just a merchant to more like having a little virtual world, introduce player ownership and like property rights for digital goods and currencies. And they can start to be more like, you know, a central bank almost in their, in their virtual worlds. And you know, have all kinds of, you know, fiscal policies as players, you know, trade with each other and generate income. You know, they can have all kinds of monetary policies and, you know, trading fees and the like, and just open up new revenue streams and new sources of value too, like asset value and the like. So, yeah, like, on the one hand, it's just better for players to be able to own things and everybody wants to do it. And if you're willing to spend $50 in a game where you know that $50 is a pure entertainment expenditure, you might be willing to spend more or spend the 50 more easily if, you know, you could resell the stuff you bought and recoup some of your costs or maybe you put some work into it. You use, you know, the thing you bought to overcome a big challenge or a boss in the game and it levels up and now it's more rare and you could sell it actually for a profit, you know, um, players suspend even more, you know, that way.
00:36:52.810 - 00:37:05.854, Speaker B: So it's like fundamentally better for players and then there's like a much bigger opportunity space for developers. So I think that's why we're starting to see really just this year, like the, the idea start to catch wind in the games industry in a pretty big way.
00:37:09.204 - 00:37:27.904, Speaker A: Do you think the like, like what we see in like v zero games now, like Axie, like is purely financial with a bit of gaming, right. Do you think that's going to shift more towards kind of balance?
00:37:28.684 - 00:37:56.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I hope so. Like I think, you know, Axie and games like that are super cool. Like they're super innovative. You know, they sort of proved out what a lot of people have talked about for a while in terms of like what's possible in, in blockchain gaming, right. In terms of like the potential market size and growth and whatever, all that. But I do think like at the end of the day, what will matter? Let's say that that becomes like more commonplace sort of.
00:37:56.100 - 00:39:10.840, Speaker B: All games let you own things and trade things and there's a marketplace and you know, some assets have price dynamics and whatever. Players can trade goods and services. Once that's commonplace, then what matters is just, is the game fun? It's like we're back to games. Is the game fun? Is there a good community? Are there ongoing updates, whether that's from a developer and publisher or a bunch of community members that are enabled to create things in the game? That's what will matter and what will be sticky. So yeah, what we try to focus on in forte is actually um, very much the um, not any of the speculative sort of dynamic or like, you know, having um, like tokens early on or whatever. It's, it's really um, like introducing gameplay and, and player trading and then the ability to um, the ability to um, like create an open market, you know, over time that's really oriented around the gameplay and like having, if you have tokens in the game, having those have like a real use inside of the game, there's a gameplay purpose for them that's not really just tied to you hope to make a profit on it. You want it for gameplay reasons first and foremost.
00:39:10.840 - 00:39:26.244, Speaker B: And then when you do that, all kinds of stuff will emerge. People will probably create businesses and do whatever in the game and that's great, but it's not a financial product first. It's a game first and then it's just got property rights in a market economy that emerges.
00:39:29.464 - 00:39:51.128, Speaker A: Well, like I. Did you beat the, did you play Animal Crossing? Like because I like beat the turnip market. So is that like going to be a challenge for game developers? Like understanding that that can't really happen with a, with a thing that's worth.
00:39:51.176 - 00:40:33.690, Speaker B: Money when there's real money. Yeah, totally. It is. And that's part of what we spend a lot of time with developers on. Sort of like how do you think about, um, token economies? How do you try to make them sustainable? And like, you know, what actually, what is there to learn from traditional economics and market economies? What is there to learn from free to play games which have pretty complex economies in some ways, and then also what is there to learn from blockchain and what we've seen in Defi and some of the cycles in the, in the space. And you know, we think about this will probably take too long to go into, in this, in this conversation all today. But like we really think about video, you know, economic protocols, you know, a term you know, I got from Neil Stephenson and in the diamond age or whatever.
00:40:33.690 - 00:41:47.894, Speaker B: But you know, it's like economic protocols. That's what we think tokens are. And so how do you design a sustainable economic protocol that thinks about basically, you know, protocols define networks. Who are the network participants? You know, if you're a game, who are the players, who are the creators, who's the community around the game? And like, what contributions do they make to the game? What benefits can they get from the game? And how do you create a sustainable network that way? And so, yeah, it's like a shift in thinking. I think it is a lot for developers to wrap their heads around, but we're starting to see more examples of what might be possible. And even if you look at things like top shot, for example, you see initially sort of nfts and trading, but you know, now trying to introduce more and more ways to use the nfts and you know, secondary systems and maybe currencies to like hold value over time. I don't, I don't mean hold value in terms of like, you know, the monetary value, but like be able to more easily store like fungible value, you know, in a system that started off as just totally oriented around non fungibles.
00:41:47.894 - 00:41:58.054, Speaker B: So I feel like at equilibrium, all these systems end up looking pretty similar and they end up looking a lot like market economies today in the physical world.
00:42:00.994 - 00:42:19.534, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Do you think the business models for this is going to shift from game developers kind of expected to sell digital items to actually kind of like getting a portion of the economic activity?
00:42:19.874 - 00:43:25.744, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it kind of shifts from, look, developers will always be able to merchandise, just be a merchant and sell stuff. So nothing about embracing blockchains and token economies changes that or diminishes it, but it opens up all this new stuff. Basically you shift from just being a merchant to actually you're a big participant in this market economy and sort of you're aligned with your players in that actually the more value your players have, the more they trade, even the more like income they make from the way they play the game or the goods and services they trade with other players, the bigger your economy gets and the more revenue streams you as a developer can derive from it through the protocols you create, the more you're aligned with players in terms of just growing the size of the economy overall. So, yeah, I think it will totally change the way that, like, as developers over the next couple years wrap their heads around that. It will totally change, you know, the way they think about how to manage a game, create a game economy and, you know, participate in it.
00:43:29.604 - 00:44:12.534, Speaker A: What's going to happen with something like multi, like, you know, people talk about the metaverse and I almost feel like where there isn't like a single metaverse, that we're all kind of building these little pieces together. And this idea of a multi chain world, I think is that's like a boring part of it. Like that's like the layer one base layer, who cares? But like, what about like multi world? Like the multi world first, right? Whatever you want to call it, right? Taking digital items from something like Star Atlas and moving it into like a fantasy world and vice versa.
00:44:12.654 - 00:45:05.382, Speaker B: Yeah, totally, totally. Yeah, I mean, I think that will happen and there's going to be a bunch of different layers of it. But I think one way to think about this stuff is that at the end of the day, it's not necessarily that, like every item in a game or application, like every digital asset will need to be totally interoperable. But at a base layer, like, you know, if you own the things, you can at least transfer the value of that asset around. And then, you know, maybe there's another layer of interoperability that orients around, just like the claims that you could make. Like, I own this thing and I can, I own this thing over here and I can prove it, you know, in some way. And then that enables you to have another instantiation or manifestation of that thing in this other world that you have.
00:45:05.382 - 00:45:51.714, Speaker B: And so I think that's sort of how a lot of metaverse, what people call metaverse stuff today, will manifest. So, like an NFT part of the answer that would be like, hey, I can prove I own this particular NFT in game one, that NFT is manifested the ownership of that NFT, like the game wants to recognize it for whatever reason, they think there's. Their players would think it's cool or there's an economic reason to recognize it. And so if you can prove that you're the account that has that NFT in this game, then you get some benefit in that game. Maybe it manifests as a player skin or whatever, but in another game you can prove that you're the account that owns that same NFT. It might manifest in a totally different way. Maybe it's a boost or a power up.
00:45:51.714 - 00:46:29.914, Speaker B: I think as people start to think about nfts and what you hold in an account as more of an ownership record or almost a claims voucher, thats how interoperability will emerge. And theres early versions of this with projects like Loot where theres not really an NFT, its not a particular picture or whatever. Its just, I can prove that im the one that owns this set of metadata. Basically, the game will realize that in whatever way it chooses to. And like, that's sort of what metaverse stuff will. That's like a baby version of what Metaverse stuff will probably look like in the future.
00:46:30.694 - 00:47:11.806, Speaker A: I'm like imagining like in my star Atlas starship, there's like a sword that's hanging, right, right. And I want that sword to wear as I'm playing the fantasy game and playing dragons and seeing the effects of that now appear in another game, even if it's all cosmetic, I feel like that immersion will like really kind of like create that like, you know, you know, break, break that barrier for people. I'm stoked, man. This is like what I was dreaming of as a teenager playing those like, for the first time. Really playing like massive multiplayer games where you kind of saw the power of the Internet and gaming all at the same time.
00:47:11.950 - 00:47:45.356, Speaker B: Totally, totally. Yeah. And it's cool to see, even in games where there isn't any direct, like real money, how much players do trade and actually how. How complex the economies get. And you know, there's. There's um, ways to design that so that um, you know, it's not very fun for players, like where, you know, you sort of have to grind really hard and then that leads to like gold farming or grind farming or whatever. And sort of like there's a group of people that's willing to just sit there and click on buttons in a game to get paid like less than a minimum wage or livable wage or whatever, but just because it's a way to make a little bit of money.
00:47:45.356 - 00:49:08.654, Speaker B: But then there's really cool ways to think about it where actually like, you know, um, people have more real ownership and, you know, they can do things like, I just want to specialize in the, I just want to focus on the parts of the game that I really like and I can trade with other people to, you know, get goods from other parts of the game that, you know, maybe I don't want to focus on as a, as a, as a player or like I play with a bunch, you know, with a big guild, a big, a big group of players. And we sort of, you know, together have this, you know, whatever guild hall that we, that we own and we can all upgrade it and we can all benefit from the upgrades in the game. And that thing produces goods that other players want and so we can sell them into the market and we all can benefit from that. And it gives us, we already want to play the game and play together because of the game and overcome challenges. But now actually, maybe we can earn an income from this thing. And over time, I think, um, you know, as people's lives are more and more digital around the world, you know, games and blockchain sort of create, um, these ways to have real ownership and to like derive income from all your digital or virtual experiences. And I think, you know, games will be one of the first places that, that, like, becomes real at real scale where you've got players kind of freely trading in this big global economy.
00:49:08.654 - 00:49:14.594, Speaker B: And to me, that's just super cool. Like, you know, that, that possibility. Over the next few years, I already.
00:49:14.674 - 00:49:42.176, Speaker A: See some of this, like just emerging from like the simple NFT drops. Like when that thing is really successful. Like there's a community. That's all they do is that they identify by like a, you know, PFP on Twitter and it's the monkey PFP or whatever, but it becomes its own social network and it really feels like guilds, like guilds in like every massive game or every like team game where you can like work together. They're all going to do this.
00:49:42.320 - 00:50:15.794, Speaker B: Totally, man, totally. And then again, what's cool about. And I think game developers are just starting to wrap their heads around this stuff, but by putting this stuff out on a public distributed ledger or a blockchain, you let people tap into stuff like that. So it's like, cool. I'm part of this guild in whatever some MMO and I can actually, because that data sits on an open ledger, other applications can recognize that. So yeah, maybe it manifests as a PFP on Twitter. It's got some metadata with a URL to a PFE version of it and now I can show off that I'm part of this guild and part of that guild and whatever if I want to.
00:50:15.794 - 00:50:30.434, Speaker B: Just opening up the data like that is super, super cool. And once some games start to do it it'll be like every game has to do it because it's just so much better for players once you figure it out and make it a good user experience.
00:50:32.214 - 00:50:33.406, Speaker A: Awesome man.
00:50:33.590 - 00:51:47.384, Speaker B: Yeah. For us at Forte that user experience, that player experience is a big part of what we're trying doing to solve like onboarding into crypto. Today of those 3 billion people that play games a tiny fraction of them know anything about crypto let alone care about it deeply or could like keep themselves safe you know in the space. So you know we try to make it easy to onboard and that, that ends up touching like technology. It ends up touching like you know new sort of protocol development with like identity and the like it ends up touching regulation and compliance because you know to onboard people and let them trade with each other and in many jurisdictions that ends up being whether we all like it or not it ends up being a regulated activity. And so how can you make all this easy for users to onboard and not on one hand have to go through some crazy like hey let us teach you about cryptography and here's private keys, don't ever lose them or you're totally fucked on one hand and on other hand also not have to go through heavy KYC and have no way out to exiting a trusted or totally centralized system. So like how do you make that a good player experience and give players like choice? It's a big part of what we've been working on.
00:51:49.564 - 00:52:05.724, Speaker A: Yeah there's, the regulation side is really challenging because I think you know in a lot of ways that's probably what stopped a lot of game developers from adopting stuff like this way earlier. Totally and I'm glad like know blockchain is kind of paving the way there.
00:52:06.064 - 00:53:07.694, Speaker B: Totally, totally. Yeah like Valve, I know we're almost up but like Valve has you know counter strike go and there's like a pretty big skins marketplace for it and for a minute valve like pulled that into their official kind of marketplace and allowed real money transactions but Fincen in the US you know came and shut them down. Cause they're like hey you're like transmitting money, what are you doing? And so they had to turn it all off you know and so yeah I think game developers know stories like that and sort of when you have a big game and a player base you care about and revenue you depend on. To operate a big franchise, you sort of have to take that stuff seriously. You can't mess around. You're not going to risk your whole business to experiment with something new, basically. So, yeah, we got to synthesize this stuff, make things self sovereign and trustless and sit on decentralized ledgers, but let big businesses that have massive scale play with, you know, use this stuff and take advantage of it, but sort of not shoot themselves in the foot.
00:53:08.474 - 00:53:21.738, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah, yeah. It really feels like this was like one of the missing pieces for the metaverse. Yeah. So super excited to just be a part of it, honestly.
00:53:21.866 - 00:53:22.858, Speaker B: Yeah, no doubt, man.
00:53:22.906 - 00:53:53.154, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're running up to the end of the hour, you know, like, really cool to have you participate and be working with you guys on gaming. I really feel like this is one of those places where the Internet was born out of gaming. People going to Facebook and playing Zynga for what it was worth, really created web two. And if you can get the same onboarding for people into crypto, I think it'll be kind of world changing.
00:53:53.654 - 00:54:02.110, Speaker B: Totally, man, totally. Yeah. And I think even back in the day, BBS's and muds and stuff, like gaming is kind of there, so. Yeah. Yeah. Will be awesome. Yeah.
00:54:02.110 - 00:54:08.662, Speaker B: And we're stoked to be working with you guys, too, so. Yeah, thanks for having me on, man. It's fun to talk. Do it again soon.
00:54:08.838 - 00:54:10.798, Speaker A: Sure. All right.
00:54:10.966 - 00:54:13.094, Speaker B: Thanks, man. Okay. Thanks, everybody. See ya.
