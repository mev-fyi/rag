00:00:03.200 - 00:00:15.582, Speaker A: Well, hello there. Where's everybody? Come on, we need some energy in the room, guys. I know it's just secondary, but we can actually do it. Let's go. Okay. To begin. Hi, my name is Luis.
00:00:15.582 - 00:01:05.398, Speaker A: I'm the CEO and co founder of writer. Let's do a little bit of rewind, shall we? So I went to crypto in 2016, our CDO, Marvin, writer's other co founder in 2013. Now, we went to Webtree because of the ideals. There were three. It was permissionless, decentralization and sovereignty. These are the ideals that we believe in, that our team believe in, and it's probably the reason why you're here today. But the biggest question that we had after working in the protocol level for years is why is it so difficult for everyone else to actually uphold the values of web3? So I have friends in 2016, the same time I went to the space that wanted to go in.
00:01:05.398 - 00:01:42.130, Speaker A: Ok, let's fast forward seven years later. They're still in the same spot, stuck. They find web3 intimidating and difficult, like most consumers. Now, let's not mention the fact that if you start your first Webtree experience, you're actually greeted by a twelve or 24 word, or what we call seed phrases. And if we're going to be honest here, we as a collective, humans are not really great at keeping secrets, let alone protecting these seed phrases. Bam. Right? $3.5
00:01:42.130 - 00:02:24.894, Speaker A: billion is the staggering amount that was lost due to seed phrases. People can't handle it, period. At Rider, we actually assembled the best team to give you the best solution to solve this problem. You have web3 native experts from top tier protocol, like stacks, OpenSea, and trust machines. And now you combine it with web3, hardware export that actually brought millions of devices worldwide. Together, we made it our mission to actually create a harbor wallet that satisfies three criteria. First, no single point of failure.
00:02:24.894 - 00:02:51.734, Speaker A: Second, low mental health effort. And third, maximum ease of transaction. We want to provide our moms, dads, friends and family a super simple and super secure way to actually interact with with digital asset. And now, after two years of development, we're proud to introduce you to rider one.
00:03:04.914 - 00:03:06.094, Speaker B: Super simple.
00:03:26.724 - 00:03:28.304, Speaker A: Super secure.
00:03:34.424 - 00:04:01.424, Speaker B: Super strong, super simple. There's more.
00:04:22.324 - 00:04:42.260, Speaker A: Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think I have something in my pocket, actually. Oh, wow. So, okay, let's go. Right. Okay. Rider is actually the first hardware wallet that combines security, simple setup and easy recovery.
00:04:42.260 - 00:05:31.734, Speaker A: And rider one is actually the first step towards our multi year long vision of bringing your digital asset in the real world. Right. I think the vision that we always have is what if you can actually give productivity to this asset? So rider is actually powered by NFC, the same technology in Apple Pay. If you combine NFC with digital assets, you're able to unlock a lot of web3 use cases, from buying your coffee to actually entering trip with your digital collectibles in breakpoint. And even me and worse, stoly and Austin can actually do in real life assets work. And that's what we're bringing to the space. And there are three things to get started with your best hardware wallet user onboarding experience.
00:05:31.734 - 00:06:23.678, Speaker A: First, we have, of course, the rider one, which is the hardware wallet. Second thing is we have this thing called I have a lot in my pocket today, rider recovery tag. Right? And these are NFC battery free tags, which are ultra resistant to dust and water and that can retain data after 25 years. And lastly, you're also going to need the rider mobile application. These three things needs to work together in order to give you the best user and boring experience for hardware wallets. Now, first, rider is super simple. You simply tap your rider recovery tag with the rider mobile application against your router one to create and backup your wallet.
00:06:23.678 - 00:07:05.574, Speaker A: It takes less than 60 seconds. Second, router is super secure. You just need to tap to send a transaction, and your paired phone can only talk to your router device. And of course, for all the security maxis out there, it's actually 100% air gap, no Bluetooth, no Wifi. It's portless, giving you the utmost security, simplicity security, that's what we want when it comes to the architectural design for Rider. And third, rider is super strong. So Rider actually boasts an IP 68 rating, making it the dust and water resistant.
00:07:05.574 - 00:07:23.494, Speaker A: And probably your question is, okay, how did we make it all possible? And to talk about the security and technical implementation of Rider, I would love to call on our CEO, Marvin Janssen on this stage to talk about security.
00:07:43.174 - 00:08:13.338, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, it's such a pleasure to be here. I'm Marvin, the CTO of Rider. I'd love to talk to you a little bit about how the rider one works and how our new recovery backup system works. So I'd love to introduce Tapsafe recovery. So tab safe recovery is a seed phraseless recovery mechanism as an alternative to using paper backups. So tap safe recovery. As Louis already introduced, it just takes 60 seconds to set up a wallet and create a backup.
00:08:13.338 - 00:08:36.154, Speaker B: So what happens if you want to recover your wallet? Well, all you need to do is simply reverse the process. It is worth noting that Tabsafe recovery is completely self custodial. So everything is offline. It never leaves your device. You have full control over how and when you want to create your backup. Rider is the company. We never receive any sort of information about your wallet.
00:08:36.154 - 00:08:56.214, Speaker B: So let's look at the default situation here. So you just bought your rider, it comes with one rider recovery tag, and you have your mobile device. So in a normal situation here, you're good to go. You can use your wallet, you can use your assets. It takes a simple tap to send a transaction. Everything is secure. Now, let's imagine you lose your writer.
00:08:56.214 - 00:09:23.748, Speaker B: So what happens next? As long as you have your writer recovery tag and your mobile phone, there's really no issue. You simply get a new, shiny writer. You reverse the process. So you collect your recovery tag that you hidden away somewhere safe, maybe at your mom's home, I don't know. You bring it together with your writer, you tap. You're halfway done recovering. You bring it to your phone, you tap, and if the clicker works, you recover your wallet.
00:09:23.748 - 00:09:44.530, Speaker B: It's that easy. But there are more variations because we understand that everybody's security needs are different. People create different kinds of backups. So let's look at a different situation. So tap. Safe recovery is very flexible. The recovery tag comes with the writer, but you can choose to add more recovery tags later on.
00:09:44.530 - 00:10:24.194, Speaker B: So let's imagine that you have multiple rider recovery tags that you've hidden away in different places around the world, different physical locations, and you lose both your rider and your mobile device. So in this situation, you collect at least two recovery tags. You can have more than two, but you can mix any two. You bring them together, you tap halfway through, you tap again, and your writer wallet is recovered. But that's not all. You can set up even more different kinds of recovery methods as well. So in this situation, you can actually include your social circle and make them part of your backup process.
00:10:24.194 - 00:11:01.096, Speaker B: So we call this the social recovery aspect of Tabsafe recovery. So I have to stress and say that doing this is completely optional. As I said, everybody has different security needs. So we understand that some people love to use social recovery, but it might not be for everyone. So there's definitely no requirement to use this. So in this situation, all that your social circle, all that they need is the mobile app on their phone. You can meet them at different points in time, you can give them a backup share, and they become part of your Tabsafe recovery process.
00:11:01.096 - 00:11:23.452, Speaker B: So in this situation, I lost my writer, I lost my phone, but I still have my tag. I tap my tag, and as you can see, we're halfway there. So now the social circle, they each count for one quarter of your backup process. So, as you can see, halfway there. Meet my first friend. Go to my wife, please help me. Back up my wallet.
00:11:23.452 - 00:11:35.628, Speaker B: Go to my friend Lois. Back up the other part. And there you go. My wallet is recovered. I can start using my assets again immediately. But that's not all. Imagine a worst case scenario.
00:11:35.628 - 00:11:57.580, Speaker B: You lose your writer, you lose your recovery tag. I don't know how you do it. And you lose your phone. Worst case, does that mean that everything is lost? Your asset is gone. You can no longer access your soul. Well, not necessarily, if you have utilized your social circle and made them part of your backup process. If you have four members in your social circle, you can still recover.
00:11:57.580 - 00:12:20.704, Speaker B: As I mentioned before, every member in your social circle counts for one quarter. So you meet them individually. You don't have to do this. At the same time, you don't have to host a writer recovery party or anything like that. You do that in your own time. You tap, and your wallet is recovered. So how does Tabsafe recovery work behind the scenes? So, getting a bit more technical here.
00:12:20.704 - 00:12:58.892, Speaker B: Rider is powered by a Shamir secret sharing algorithm. And now, many of you might say, okay, I've heard of this. I know this. So we have a custom implementation of chamir that we call our weighted chamier secret sharing algorithm. So what Shamir allows you to do is to take some secret information, in this case, your master private key of your wallet, and split this into multiple pieces. So, with Shamir, the very interesting thing is that even if you have some of these pieces, it won't allow you to infer or find out any information about the wallet. So, in our case, you need at least four pieces to recover.
00:12:58.892 - 00:13:29.744, Speaker B: As you just saw, a writer recovery tag contains two pieces. Your phone contains two pieces. Your optional social circle contains one piece each. So even if someone manages to find one piece of your backup, or even two or even three, they will not be able to access your wallet in any way. So it is very important to stress here that the tap safe recovery protocol is going to be fully open source. So we don't want people to end up on islands. We want to build bridges.
00:13:29.744 - 00:14:06.836, Speaker B: That's very important to us. So that means that. Thank you. That means that even if long time down the line, 20 years down the line, right, of the company doesn't exist in this shape or form, you can still rest easy and know that you can recover your wallet. And what is very exciting is that we're already talking to third party vendors that are very interested in implementing both Tabsafe recovery as well as supporting the rider one. So we think that's very important. Finally, the Tabsafe recovery process is currently being audited by coin fabric, and more audits are going to follow soon thereafter as well.
00:14:06.836 - 00:14:36.050, Speaker B: I think they have a booth around here, so be sure to visit them. They're an awesome team. So what is inside, writer one? First, we have an MCU, powerful, but battery efficient. So the MCU will draw all the beautiful uis that you just saw. Quinton worked very hard on those, and there's a lot of beautiful UI still to come. It will power all the interactions and all the interesting stuff you do with the rider. But then next to that, we also have a so called secure element chip.
00:14:36.050 - 00:15:09.094, Speaker B: So secure element chip, for those of you who don't know, is a more secure chip than a normal MCU. They're more resistant against different kinds of attacks. And this is the chip that contains your sensitive information. So your private keys are in there. The secure element does the signing operations, but even the tab safe recovery protocol is implemented in the secure element. So this is a secure element that generates these secure shares. So the chip that we're using is a latest generation infineon chip.
00:15:09.094 - 00:15:47.326, Speaker B: It's SLE 78. And we're very happy to also announce that we are working on a custom operating system for this chip that we're calling rideros. So what's inside the recovery tag? So inside the recovery tag there is a NXP P 71 series chip. This is also a european producer. It's a very interesting chip in that it is smarter than your average NFC tech. So these are the same types of chips that you find in bank cards, and they allow for a certain amount of programmability, and they're also very secure. Lois already mentioned there's a data retention of 25 years.
00:15:47.326 - 00:16:32.634, Speaker B: So using these tags, you can be sure that your wallet will be safe for a long time to come. And then finally, we have various mechanisms in place to ensure that when you're using the writer, you can feel secure. So the secure element has various different ways to detect a discrepancy in either the firmware, so that the code that is installed in the writer, or in the payloads, like the transactions, you send it through NFC. And when it detects one of these discrepancies, the writer will light up red. It will literally start blinking red. We have leds that will blink red to know that something is wrong. So when you see this as a user, and you should never see this, but when you do, you should proceed with extreme caution.
00:16:32.634 - 00:17:21.918, Speaker B: So these leds are actually directly connected to the secure element. So that means that even if the other chip, the MCU, is compromised, it will not be able to prevent the writer from lighting up red on top of that. You saw earlier in the video that to confirm a transaction, all you need to do is hold the writer. So the button that makes this possible, we have a capacitive button under the glass. This button is also connected directly to the secure element. So that means even if the MCU is compromised, there is no way for the MCU to trick the secure element into believing like, hey, the user you pressed confirm we want to do this transaction. So we'd love to introduce the amazing launch partners that we're working with.
00:17:21.918 - 00:17:43.364, Speaker B: We're very excited to work with them, but of course, we're always open to finding more partners. So if you're interested, please come talk to us after the presentation. We'd love to chat and see where it can take us. So after all of this, you might be wondering, like, okay, so how can I get my hands on a rider? How much is it going to cost? And for that, I will hand it off back to Louis.
00:17:50.104 - 00:18:31.434, Speaker A: Ok, guys, this is probably the moment you've been waiting for. How much is one? Right? So, ok, this little beautiful thing actually retails at $249. And today, just today, for the next 40, 48 hours, you can actually enjoy a $90 discount on rider one. Riderone is currently available on Kickstarter. So if you're interested to actually buy one, pledge now, here's the QR code for it. And yeah, the big question that we have is, are you writing? Thank you.
