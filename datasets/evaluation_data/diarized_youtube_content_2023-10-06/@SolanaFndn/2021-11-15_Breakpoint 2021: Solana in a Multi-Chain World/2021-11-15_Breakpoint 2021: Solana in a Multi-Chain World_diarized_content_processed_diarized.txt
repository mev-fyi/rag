00:00:23.120 - 00:01:08.412, Speaker A: Hello. So as the market matures, we'll end up with multiple chains, most likely. On top of that, there's central banks that might start issuing their own currencies. So we'll have to start solving problems of cross chain transfers and development on different blockchains. So, in order to discuss this, I have a panel. Andrey Falav of CTO of Neon Labs, Michael Burgers, CEO of the Ren Project, and Van Fu, co founder of technology Floating Point Group. Welcome.
00:01:08.588 - 00:01:09.436, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:01:09.580 - 00:01:10.464, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:01:11.484 - 00:01:39.244, Speaker A: So, all of us have worked on various aspects of cross chain, multi chain technology. So I think it would be most interesting if we start off by introducing ourselves, what we've worked on, what problems we have solved, and what challenges we have faced. And then after that, we'll do some questions. Andre, start.
00:01:40.584 - 00:02:45.384, Speaker D: Ok. I'm CTO engineering labs, and our team have developed an ethereum virtual machine for Solana. It's a not classical virtual machine, it has a different design. Our EVM is executed by the Solana virtual machine, and we can upgrade it in any time to do it, our governance should sign the transaction for upgrading, and that's all. After that, any user transaction which can be formed using any Ethereum toolkit can be sent to the Solana cluster. And the Solana cluster will execute user transaction in parallel Ethereum like transaction and stores data in the Solana state. So any application from the Ethereum ecosystem can be executed on the Solana.
00:02:45.384 - 00:03:17.628, Speaker D: Yesterday and today, we show and workshop how it works. If you want, you can come on the second floor and I will show you in life how I download open Zeppelin contracts, compile it in Ethereum toolkit, and upload to Solana cluster and call its methods. Okay, wonderful.
00:03:17.676 - 00:03:49.216, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah. So, Michael Burgess, CEO of Ren. We're an interoperability protocol, or a bridging protocol, and we support a variety of layer ones, but Solana as well. And to date, we've brought around $600 million worth of assets to Solana, with a total of 200 5300 million tvl at this stage. Majority of that's in bitcoin, but we also support a variety of other legacy assets, filecoin, zcash, so on. Yeah.
00:03:49.216 - 00:03:52.524, Speaker B: So it's been quite successful. The Solana team's been great to us.
00:03:53.144 - 00:03:53.472, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:53.488 - 00:04:30.644, Speaker B: And I think a few things that makes renvm relatively unique is two things. First of all, this minting and burning of assets is fluid or permissionless. So essentially the user sends in real bitcoin to a bitcoin address. It's then custodialed by RenvM or network. And then a one for one SPL token is minted on the Solana blockchain as RenbTC, and then they can go and take that and do what they wish with it. A majority of our success at this point has been through the saber pools. These one to one amms, they've allowed us to bootstrap a fair amount of liquidity, and that's where we've seen a majority of our success at the this stage.
00:04:30.644 - 00:05:07.720, Speaker B: The second point is it's composable. And so what that means is Runvm is a network. It's a decentralized custodian, so you can embed arbitrary contract data within a smart contract call. So an example is a user wants to send bitcoin, real bitcoin, to Solana, but then deposit it to a saber pool, for example. So they can do that all on one on chain transaction. So Renv will take the bitcoin custodial meant that one for one SPL token, and then automatically deposit that into a saber pool. So the user really just has to send in real bitcoin, and that's it, and then it's deposited.
00:05:07.720 - 00:05:31.900, Speaker B: So, Rohit, actually, one of our developers will be speaking on this after the panel. So if you want to learn more about it and how it all works. Yeah, definitely join that. Yeah. So that's what makes Renvm unique. And I think one thing to note that we're working on, it'll come out in the next couple of weeks, maybe a month, is something called host to host. And that will allow us to take any generic ERC 20 token and mint it on Solana.
00:05:31.900 - 00:05:49.504, Speaker B: So we'll be focused on stable coins at first, of course. So that's where the highest liquidity is. But, yeah, I think that'll bring a variety of more assets and more liquidity to the Solana ecosystem and allow, again, this fluid minting and burning that I mentioned. Yeah, so we're super excited, and the Solana team has been great. Thank you.
00:05:50.164 - 00:06:44.884, Speaker C: Good morning. My name is Van, and I'm pretty soaked to be on this panel right now, because normally I'm the most technical guy on the panel, but not in this case. Definitely not in this case. So I work on a company called Floating Point Group, and what we do is we help traditional financial institutions trade, settle in custody, their crypto. What this looks like is we set up NPC wallets so that customers can give us their assets and trust that we can work with their assets in a safe and secure way. And then afterwards, we get them the best price, as well as move their wallets to any DeFi protocols or any cold storage that they would need. And a lot of the DeFi work that we do, I won't regurgitate what Michael has already said, but we basically do what Michael says with serverless functions, and it's a lot of headaches not being able to solve that problem on the blockchain level.
00:06:44.884 - 00:07:08.824, Speaker C: Instead, we have to have a lot of wave functions, a lot of, of asynchronous functions just to wait on Ethereum, wait on the slower chains to maximize yield farming for our customers. In terms of the next steps for us, we're going to grow our team. And so, yeah, if you guys are ever interested in working with the smartest guys on the block, aside from these guys, talk to us.
00:07:10.524 - 00:07:52.454, Speaker A: Thank you. So I work on Solang. It's a steady compiler which can compile synergy into native Solana, but also native Polkadot and native Ethereum e wasm. So I'm kind of used to working with different communities, and it's a good thing because the different communities all want a new compiler so different groups can work together. And even though even everyone's working on their own chain, there doesn't seem to be any problems cooperating. It seems to be quite. Everyone seems very cooperative.
00:07:52.454 - 00:08:13.778, Speaker A: So van, when I spoke to you, you mentioned that the financial institutions. You help financial institutions evaluate different chains. So what criteria would they use to compare chains?
00:08:13.906 - 00:08:14.474, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:08:14.594 - 00:09:02.574, Speaker C: So, you know, I'm sure everyone in the audience has heard about the blockchain trilemma, right? You can only have two of the three. Three being scalability, security and decentralization. Well, in the future of, in the future of blockchain, you know, institutions will care about a few other things too. We've seen already some of these things, permissions with respect to ripple and xrapid. You've seen a better UI Ux with respect to the newer blockchains out there that are a little bit easier to use than bitcoin. And really, transparency is a bigger one that will come out in full force once institutions start moving in. And it's not, I don't think it's realistically possible to have one blockchain solve all of those problems.
00:09:02.574 - 00:10:04.806, Speaker C: Instead, you would need to have a multi chain solution. There would be a blockchain per solution. And hopefully the surface area of all the blockchains combined together adds up to meet all of the standards that you're looking for. And where I see Solana playing a part in all of this, is that because of its focus on scalability? It definitely has a place in being the Nexus blockchain where everything gets settled and sort of where Michael spoke kind words about the sabre community and how their protocol is moving tons of money right now and their tvo is incredibly high. Shout out to Ian if you can hear me. That's how we see the future of blockchain as well, where all the other larger chains, or not larger chains, sorry, all of the other chains on top will communicate down to the Solana layer, will make all the bridges will exist on the Solana layer. All of the money will move through the Solana layer.
00:10:04.806 - 00:10:24.964, Speaker C: By virtue of the fact that Solana has focused on scalability, that doesn't mean that other chains don't have their place. A chain with transparency will be on top of Solana. A chain with security will be on top of Solana. But yeah, I really do see that the realistic paradigm of the future of blockchain will be a multi chain future.
00:10:29.264 - 00:10:31.328, Speaker A: Michael, do you want to say anything more about that?
00:10:31.376 - 00:11:18.262, Speaker B: Yeah, actually I couldn't agree more. I think Solana will serve, and this is pontificating here, but I think Solana will serve as kind of a global settlement layer for a forex market. I mean, we're going to be bringing a variety of stable coins over that are not native to Solana, and there'll of course be native token contracts like USDC that are just natively minted on Solana. So you can think of it again as this global settlement layer for a forex market where you have all these stablecoin assets coming in. Pair that with the saber pools, and you can move one to one to a variety of the different assets. And with Solana's speed, I think that's going to be very conducive for that type of product to come about. So, yeah, I'm personally looking forward to it.
00:11:18.262 - 00:11:43.414, Speaker B: I mean, of course that'll be something. Just bringing the assets and the liquidity, of course, will be an effort, but then creating again a nice ux on top of that, where an individual can just come in with Dai or whatever the stablecoin they have and immediately switch it out for whatever they want and either keep it on Solana or burn it back to another chain of their preference after they've actually done the settlement. Couldn't agree more.
00:11:45.074 - 00:11:50.694, Speaker A: You mentioned bridge aggregators, which was a new concept to me. Can you talk a bit about that?
00:11:51.074 - 00:12:33.554, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm just kind of assuming they'll pop up, and I know there's a few teams working on them. But just as we have Dex aggregators on Ethereum, a user doesn't want to go to uniswap, sushiswap curve, a variety of these standalone liquidity pools. They want to go to a nice clean Ui and like I want Ethereum for Dai and then the bridge aggregator tell or excuse me, the Dex aggregator tells them the best price they'll owe us fees. So just apply that concept to a bridge aggregator as well. You'll set your parameters, whatever that might be, and they'll pick and choose the best bridge for what you're looking to accomplish. And I think, I assume it will come true. We'll see.
00:12:33.554 - 00:12:53.044, Speaker B: But I think that kind of falls under the umbrella of improving UX, just generally for the user. User, they don't want to sign transactions, they just want to show up with their asset and get whatever they're looking for or bridge it accordingly. So yeah, I think it'll be a concept or a theme in the coming months.
00:12:54.264 - 00:13:11.994, Speaker A: Okay. Slightly switching and how the development experience of writing contracts is working multiple chains hasn't been great so far. Why is that?
00:13:15.374 - 00:15:11.954, Speaker D: At the current time, the community from Ethereum has a very big knowledge base. If you try to find some information about how you should develop the smart contracts, most answers which you will find will be about the solidity language, sometimes about the vapor, but the most recommendation about the solidity the community is very big and the situation is progress. And after some time there are a lot of blockchains which support VM and the VM became the standard blockchain industry. If you want to develop an application, the first which you will find it's some libraries, some recommendations and radio applications for Ethereum and Ethereum like blockchains with standard allows to integrate different blockchains together in easy way. And what I think about it is that if we will bring the Ethereum virtual machine to the Solana, it allows to integrate technology base of the blockchain industry to the Solana. It became too easy to grow the community on the blockchain. It brings a lot of developers, a lot of device and other blockchain applications already exist on the market.
00:15:11.954 - 00:15:43.334, Speaker D: So what I think about it that that developer, developer experience is a very big advantage for any blockchain. I think that's all.
00:15:44.434 - 00:16:01.464, Speaker A: So you've been working both in Stanley community and Ethereum community to make this work. So what's it like working across communities? Are communities receptive or people prefer to work on their own?
00:16:02.924 - 00:16:54.414, Speaker D: There are two tasks which we should resolve. The first task which that we should allow the applications to run on the Ethereum or the Ethereum applications to run on the Solana. But it's only further step. The second step which want both communities, the Ethereum and the Solana community, it's integration between them. And this is our main competition. At the current time, we created an Ethereum virtual machine, can execute simple Ethereum, not simple, any Ethereum application. But the next step, you should integrate with Solana.
00:16:54.414 - 00:17:35.634, Speaker D: So this is the main point of both communities. The Ethereum and the Solana applications from Ethereum want to get the sources and fast integrate it with Solana infrastructure when Savannah community waits Ethereum applications to integrate with them. This is the main direction of our communications with both communities, Solana and Ethereum.
00:17:36.994 - 00:17:42.114, Speaker A: Michael, what's your experience of working with different communities and bridging them?
00:17:42.234 - 00:18:12.126, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, of course. So we support, I think, seven blockchains at this point. So we have, Max and I is one of my team members. We're in the trenches dealing with community members from a variety of ecosystems. Ethereum's been great to us, of course, a variety of our volumes been there. That's what who we first supported. And they all have their nuances, of course, but yeah, Ethereum has been great, but Solana has been fantastic.
00:18:12.126 - 00:19:05.726, Speaker B: I mean, I think the easiest thing to say is they're just hungrier, whether that be the community members, the developers, the Dapp developers as well. Yeah, I mean, everyone's a bit hungrier here. So they've all been great to us, relatively collaborative. So, yeah, it's been a pleasant experience with the Solana community specifically. And, yeah, I mean, to piggyback off your point previously, I mean, I think developer tooling is so crucial. That's something that we put a lot of effort in, at least on the ren team, we've this ability to move assets to and from Solana. We have a third party SDK and basically that allows any user, or, excuse me, any developer to basically build an application or front end that allows their Dapp to bridge assets using RenVM under the hood.
00:19:05.726 - 00:19:22.448, Speaker B: So we've put a decent amount of focus on that as a result, and it's paid off. So I think just to support. As support. Your point? Developer infrastructure is crucial. Yeah. So to summarize, Solana has been great from a community perspective.
00:19:22.606 - 00:19:29.348, Speaker C: Sean, if you wouldn't mind me asking, what's your experience with coordinating two developer communities?
00:19:29.436 - 00:19:30.104, Speaker B: Yes.
00:19:31.844 - 00:20:25.876, Speaker A: It'S been very good. You notice that communities tend to very much work in their world. So, in fact, working across communities is great because you get a slightly bigger view, but I haven't come across anyone, any difficulties working across communities ever wanting to be very supportive. Writing a compiler, as I'm doing, is quite a large task. So I think there's a realization across communities that working together to make this possible is a great way of doing this, so that together we can build something which individually would be a lot more difficult. And yeah, it's been a really great experience. I come from a closed source background.
00:20:25.876 - 00:20:50.764, Speaker A: My compiler work has been mostly closed source before this, and working both open source and across communities has been. I know, but it's been absolutely fantastic. You get to work with the sort of great minds and on very interesting technology. So I really couldn't be happier, to be honest.
00:20:54.264 - 00:21:29.838, Speaker C: Yeah. And just to point on the community aspect, I mean, blockchains just, you know, as long as there's one node that has the records, they are pretty much permanent and. But what actually would kill a blockchain is the lack of community. And it's great that Solana has such a strong community, and it's great that Solana is also infecting, effectively other communities with it. Infecting meaning that the other communities have to compete with Solana. There are, you know, cosmos. There are people in Cosmos right now that were from Solana and made money off of Solana.
00:21:29.838 - 00:22:08.434, Speaker C: Tasnet. There are, you know, there are people like. Sorry, Sean, sorry, I was going to call you Stephen. There are people like Sean who, you know, moved from Polkadot and to Solana and, you know, brought his energy from Polkadot into Solana, has made Solana a little bit faster than it, you know, needed to really be. It's already too fast enough. But yeah, I think community is the end all, be all of what makes blockchain greater.
00:22:08.834 - 00:22:38.124, Speaker A: I think it might be interesting to kind of gaze in the crystal ball and think about what sort of things we think, how the market is going to develop, how you hope or envision this space developing, because this is a very important part of the whole blockchain story. So I would like to. Andre, what do you think?
00:22:43.624 - 00:24:05.344, Speaker D: I think that not developer decide which application he want to bring to the market. The market told him which applications are now required by the market. And this is an intuition. When some developer find a level which not used by other applications and which requires by the market. And if he found it, the market will welcome such application. You can sell to market any application or any language which are not needed by the market. Maybe you can explain any other aspects of this question, what do you think?
00:24:06.884 - 00:24:08.372, Speaker C: Are you referring to Michael or referring.
00:24:08.388 - 00:24:11.144, Speaker D: To any of you?
00:24:11.844 - 00:24:25.852, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I'm happy to speak on what I would like to see. I've been pushing this narrative for a while, just a general overview of where you think the market and the Solana ecosystem is going. Is that the general. Yeah.
00:24:25.868 - 00:24:30.644, Speaker A: What is sort of in a cross multi chain kind of, yeah.
00:24:30.684 - 00:25:15.294, Speaker B: So I would pretty much piggyback off the point I'd mentioned previously, and again, this is that narrative I've been pushing, really, since curve came out. 2020, 2019. It was very clear to me that one of these blockchains will be a global settlement layer for a variety of assets. Whether that just be cryptocurrencies, real estate, whatever, doesn't matter. It'll be put on chain, and then there'll be a global settlement layer. And I think with the advent of sabre on Solana, there's a really solid chance that that will indeed be Solana. So, again, this forex market, I think, is something I'm really excited for, and we're personally pushing for as an organization, but that's quite conducive, I think, to this ecosystem in particular.
00:25:15.294 - 00:25:58.674, Speaker B: So that's important, of course. But then there's a huge cross chain component to all this. We've got native assets that are minted on Solana, like USDC. We've got a bunch of native ethereum based stable coins, whether that be algorithmic or some other variant. So they'll need to be a part of this, and then eventually we'll get to cbdcs that are backed by nation states. They'll likely be on their own blockchain, but they might be native to Ethereum or Solana, who knows? But nonetheless, they'll need to be bridged to some degree. So creating infrastructure for that particular use case is crucial, and that's something we plan on working on.
00:25:58.674 - 00:26:08.754, Speaker B: So that's kind of how, that's what we're predicting and building for, basically. Yeah. So I'll leave it at that.
00:26:10.914 - 00:26:11.930, Speaker A: Dan, do you have any?
00:26:12.042 - 00:26:12.594, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:12.714 - 00:27:21.644, Speaker C: So I guess I talked a little about what Tradfi would want to see, but I'm not sure if you guys care about tradfi. But what I want to see as a developer myself is that right now, Solana is rain in Russ, a lot of people here are very familiar with JavaScript or are very familiar with Python. I'm sure some of you guys are familiar with. I don't know, sorry, I was going to say brain fuck. I guess I said brain fuck, but there's a language for everything, whether it's a trivial language, or whether it's a high level language like Python or JavaScript, or whether it's a low level language like Rust. And I think that the blockchain you will use will be highly dependent on what application you you will try to work on. So right now, I think that crypto as a whole is trying to solve the infrastructure problem, building the right infrastructure, making the right design decisions, in order to further our goal of building the right apps afterwards.
00:27:21.644 - 00:28:08.534, Speaker C: Luckily, I think we're getting quite close to solving the scalability problem, and perhaps another blockchain will solve another problem. But at the end of the day, what I want to see with the blockchain community as a whole is that cross chain interaction will be easy. Inter blockchain communication would be easy. If I could put in USDC Solana, get out USDC algorand or USDC Ethereum, that would be great. And there are pros and cons to each USDC description. But at the end of the day, there is going to be enough demand for all of these blockchains.
00:28:11.634 - 00:28:12.534, Speaker A: Okay.
00:28:14.674 - 00:28:17.534, Speaker D: What about you, Sean? What do you think about it?
00:28:20.634 - 00:29:17.138, Speaker A: I tend to look at it from a of developer experience and at the moment most of the languages are still evolving for smart contracts. So stability is very ethereum centric. That would be nice if that could be more cross chain. There are various rust frameworks for different chains, each with a advantages and disadvantages. Just need to kind of settle in some sort of way right now. If you want to port your smart contracts from one chain to the other, you can either do everything EVM or you can rewrite your contracts. If you rewrite your contracts, you need to reorder them and that's expensive and comes with risk.
00:29:17.138 - 00:29:29.774, Speaker A: So some solutions that would be good and I think time will bring that. Anything anyone would like to add?
00:29:33.994 - 00:29:35.574, Speaker C: Round of applause for Sean.
00:29:36.274 - 00:29:47.632, Speaker B: I will say one thing. We are hiring. I forgot to mention, if you want to work on this vision that I've outlined, please apply at Jobs Renproject IO. Thanks guys.
00:29:47.768 - 00:29:48.472, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:29:48.568 - 00:29:50.912, Speaker B: Yeah, cheers, man. Thank you so much. Thank you.
00:29:51.048 - 00:29:51.424, Speaker A: Thank you.
