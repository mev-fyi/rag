00:00:00.440 - 00:00:39.142, Speaker A: A quick note before we begin today. This episode is with Vibhu from Drip House, and we discuss a little bit his project, Solana Spaces. But we don't actually define what Solana Spaces was. So for those of you who weren't aware, Solana Spaces was a retail focused Solana and web3 experience that lasted about a year. There were stores in New York and Miami, and some of the core ideas that Vibu and the team explored within that retail focused project ended up becoming the company drip house, which is what we're mostly talking about today on the episode. Bibu, welcome to Validated.
00:00:39.278 - 00:00:40.634, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, Austin.
00:00:41.174 - 00:00:53.356, Speaker A: This is a long time coming. We talked about you coming on a while ago, and I think there's just so much happening with Driphouse that we never got around to it.
00:00:53.550 - 00:00:54.864, Speaker B: And I don't live in New York City.
00:00:54.944 - 00:01:42.656, Speaker A: You also don't live in New York City, which is true, but you have a pretty incredible journey into where Drip House is today. I think one of the things that's really fascinating about your experience as a founder is you've been through a lot, a lot great, a lot outside of your control. One of those things being COVID, one of those things being the bull market, turning into the bear market, turning into the crash at FTX, turning into an incredibly true bear market. But now, I mean, Drip house is just an incredible force in the slanting ecosystem. It really has changed people's perception of what an NFT should be and can be their relationship to artists. You guys have launched a ton of new products and features really quickly, including droplets. So I want to get into all of that, but let's just start out with give me an overview of what Drip actually is.
00:01:42.760 - 00:02:23.868, Speaker B: Sure. Drip's a really simple product, works very much like the products you're used to in web two, where you have content creators. In our case, it's artists, it's musicians, it's people that make videos, and they distribute content to their fans every single week through Drip. The twist is that all the content that they send out is actually on chain. And so that gives it all these interesting superpowers, like scarcity, like trading, and, yeah, it's been one of the fastest growing apps in all of crypto, I believe, certainly in Solana, and I'm really excited to continue to grow it.
00:02:23.996 - 00:03:20.336, Speaker A: Yeah. So I want to kind of dig in on that initial idea for drip because it's hard to kind of rewind our brains. But if we go back to that time, 10,000, 15,000 PFP collections were all of the rage and so much of the attention and focus was on how does that market cap get bigger? What do projects and collectors and creators have to do to sort of place push that market cap up? Royalties were crashing to go to functionally non existent. This is right after yaw had launched magic. Eden went to zero, tensor went to zero, everyone went to 0% royalties. And P NFTs as a standard really hadn't caught on yet much at all. And there was kind of a bit of a crisis, I think, within the NFT creator community, very similar to the crisis that I think a lot of traditional musicians went through when Limewire and Kazaa and Bittorrent were first coming on the scene in that sort of chaotic storm.
00:03:20.336 - 00:03:24.848, Speaker A: What did you see with drip where you're like, oh, there's room to do something different here?
00:03:25.016 - 00:04:13.466, Speaker B: Yeah. So drip started as a side project of Solana spaces. And initially it was this simple list for NFTs, basically kind of similar to like a mailchimp email list. And every week we were sending a single piece of art, or maybe a couple pieces of art to everyone that was on the list. And I remember thinking, this was started around October last year, right before they who shall not be named went under October of 22. Yes, yes, yes. And, yeah, we sent out this big edition photography edition to our people that had come to the store and people that engaged on Twitter.
00:04:13.466 - 00:05:06.074, Speaker B: And I remember thinking, oh, that wasn't that expensive. Why aren't people airdropping more nfTs? Why aren't people utilizing Solana for its kind of favorable cost structure, to do things at a bigger scale than you would typically see? And we kept rolling this ball down the hill, doing this every single week, picking up users. And eventually we got to 100,000 people on the list and we were still doing it. And what I really liked about it was that it had this interesting property of a group of people who just really, really loved it, and then a group of people who really didn't like it. I was like, that's the perfect place to be.
00:05:06.634 - 00:05:08.250, Speaker A: Polarization is in.
00:05:08.442 - 00:05:27.986, Speaker B: Yeah. And so, yeah, we knew compressed nfts were coming, which were an absolute unlock for us. I mean, makes what we're doing possible. And that's when we really grew the product in a whole bunch of ways when that came to mainnet this last year. Yeah.
00:05:28.010 - 00:06:11.324, Speaker A: So talk to me a little bit about that process of going from saying, this is a side project with Solana spaces. That project is ending. We'll get into Solana spaces as well. I want to talk a bunch about pivots, but to actually say we have this thing that isn't our core product, that's caught on some amount of attention. I think there's a lot of founders that find themselves in a similar situation. How did you and the team go about saying, we have to re architect most of our core business here, and there's something that's got some fire, a little thread of promise. What is the process of actually exploring that, like, and building a new product? Just focused on that one feature.
00:06:12.064 - 00:06:44.528, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll take you back to January. Last year, we did this drop with an artist called Flag Monkeys, and that was when we caught lightning in a bottle for the first time. And we've done that now, like, 100 times over the last year. But that was the first moment where I realized people really, really like this. And my entire life for weeks on end, was distributing invite codes for drip. All I was doing was going through DM's on Twitter, responding to people.
00:06:44.528 - 00:07:32.222, Speaker B: We even designed merch that said, don't ask me for an invite code. And, yeah, I think we were just like, okay, we're spending way too much time on this for it to be a side project, and there's way too much interest in what's going on. And, yeah, I mean, honestly, it wasn't an obvious thing to do. I think we, there were kind of two distinct things happening. One was, like, Solana spaces was clearly probably not going to continue. And then we had this lightning in a bottle situation, but, like, no business model or, like, no obvious kind of way to take it forward. But we just, you know, me and a couple of our team, we just felt like there was something there worth pulling on.
00:07:32.222 - 00:07:49.336, Speaker B: I remember writing about that on socials when we closed down Solana spaces, just saying, like, I think there's something here. I don't know what it is, but I think we should give ourselves another few months just to. To see what else there might be. And I'm very thankful we did that. Yeah.
00:07:49.480 - 00:08:05.832, Speaker A: So the core technology that drip is built on is really compressed nfts. How much of a change was that for you to say? Like, we were doing this with traditional nfts on Solana before. What did compression unlock for you guys?
00:08:06.008 - 00:08:42.439, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, so basically, Solana space is shut down. We decided we're going to continue with this promise of sending one NFT week, which seems harmless, but then there's 100,100, 50,000 people on the list, and it's getting quite expensive. And so we, between end of February and March, when compression rolled out, every single drop we were doing was costing us between $8,000 and $12,000. Wow. And that was a lot for us. We were basically funding that out of pocket at that point.
00:08:42.439 - 00:09:25.456, Speaker B: Yeah. And honestly, the moment that phantom wallet supported CMT's the same moment we switched over, because, yeah, we really couldn't do another drop on the old spec. It was going to drain all of our funds. So I think we went from, I want to say, like, 11,500 for the last drop we did with real nfts, to, like, $50 the next week. So it was like, yeah, I mean, it was truly relief for us more than anything else. But then it was also, okay, that was only $50. We can afford to go 100 x from here and not sweat.
00:09:25.456 - 00:09:43.082, Speaker B: Right. And that was. I mean, really, our playbook was trying to figure out how can we get more content to people through this format, since the cost allows it. And that's when we started dreaming up maybe other people might want their own lists as well.
00:09:43.178 - 00:10:27.008, Speaker A: Yeah. It's funny, because one of the things I think Anatolia said for a while, and this is something that I've sort of always. That first attracted me to the Solana network, is that step function changes in performance or cost fundamentally change the type of products you can build. And it will often take folks a year or two to actually figure out how to use that additional capacity. The classic example of this is we had e trade 15 years before we had Robinhood, and that the user interface paradigm and all these other changes follow the technology. But you guys are running very quickly with this. You immediately adopted compression, you immediately started pushing this out and scale scaling what your pals could do.
00:10:27.008 - 00:10:41.884, Speaker A: What sort of tech stack were you guys running to actually make that possible? Because you were running ahead of what most service providers and other vendors were. And this was, of course, coming out of Solana spaces, which was a lot of things, but it was not a tech forward organization, necessarily.
00:10:42.424 - 00:11:13.204, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we built most of the infrastructure in house, but obviously, with Solana, it's very important to have composability in a bunch of places. And for us, that meant, like, ensuring that wallets could see these. And for some time only phantom supported it. And I think other wallets kind of came. Came behind that. We also ran for three months without any trading, because no marketplace had solved that yet. And then tensor, I think, in June, released trading for that.
00:11:13.204 - 00:11:38.546, Speaker B: So for us, we really didn't have a choice. We just needed to switch to move costs, and we no longer cared about whether everything was fully featured. But, yeah, the tech was not so simple, and it continues to be difficult if you want to do it on your own. But nowadays, if you're starting from scratch, there's, I don't know, a dozen tools that let you do what we do. Right.
00:11:38.730 - 00:12:30.010, Speaker A: So let's pivot a little bit and walk through some of the economics and mechanics of the creator side of drip. Every time there's sort of a new distribution and technology platform, there's a risk for any artist that's looking to adopt it. I think there's a lot of folks who felt that Netflix was purely a value add in the early days because they were paying more money. And as we've seen with the writers strike last year, there's downside effects to changing your fundamental business model. And artists are often very cautious about those changes. So walk me through what those early conversations were like with creators and artists on Solana, where you went from saying, hey, look, you're used to selling nfts for a fixed price, and that's usually somewhere between one to five. Sol, we want to give them away.
00:12:30.162 - 00:13:28.226, Speaker B: Mm hmm. Yeah. I mean, the first conversations didn't go that well because that wasn't a very compelling value proposal. Go from making thousands of dollars every time you make something to making nothing. But, yeah, we were very lucky to have a couple of creators like DJ and poet, who's been a meta creator, meta destroyer on Solana, one of one art for a while, and a few others that I think valued the audience building above monetization. And that was kind of what we came at it with. Hey, I think there's a chance you'll be able to make money with this in the future, but in the very beginning, it was just, would you be interested in pioneering something different and breaking the mold? For many months, we didn't have much monetization at all.
00:13:28.226 - 00:14:22.780, Speaker B: It was just basically donations in the apple. Right. But, yeah, in the back of my head, we were thinking the whole time, okay, we want to make it very accessible for users to give back to creators that they like, but we also need to expand on the kinds of business models that exist in crypto and probably bring some of the web two stuff in as well. Because the reality is that if you took all of the money that users and people in the world have to spend on content, it's probably less than the total capital that advertisers are willing to spend to reach those audiences. Basically, we've been straddling both of these universes. One of giving users tools to give back to creators, starting very accessibly. We're also starting to build some more audience based models.
00:14:22.780 - 00:14:54.664, Speaker B: We just rolled out sponsored collectibles this week and I think where does all the money come from in the future? I think it's going to be coming from this inefficiency that exists in web two around content where creators really don't get paid. Platforms exercise tremendous leverage over them. And we have only abstracted business models in web two. We don't have any model that's focused directly on content monetization itself.
00:14:55.084 - 00:15:45.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so YouTube was the original platform that did 50 50 ad share. It started on X. Now Instagram still has functionally no ad share model. And so with a lot of these places, like if you look at the economics of creators, the ones who are really successful, it tends to be making most of their money actually off platform or a significant portion through, through brand deals and influencer endorsements or in person events and those sort of things. What do you find the revenue streams are for that sort of top 20% of drip creators? Are they actually getting a significant amount of revenue through droplets now? Or is it actually like when they do a collection drop through you, their one of one sales on exchange art and places like that actually see an increase in value?
00:15:46.554 - 00:16:11.762, Speaker B: I mean, it's been both. And part of it is just that the collector audience that we built is much bigger than all of the rest of Solana NFT formats combined. One of the fascinating things about NFTs is that there are more creators than there are collectors, not only in Solana, but on other blockchains as well.
00:16:11.818 - 00:16:12.274, Speaker A: Really?
00:16:12.394 - 00:16:52.230, Speaker B: Yes, yes. And so it's really a struggle for many. We'd like to think about the top creators who will mint a work for whatever they want and sell it and have no problem doing that. But for 80% to 90% of creators who are doing PFP products or selling art, actually the struggle is real and it's very difficult to find a single person to buy. So we've expanded that audience to a much bigger size than the creator pool. There's 3000 collectors for every creator on drip right now. And so on drip.
00:16:52.230 - 00:17:23.484, Speaker B: They're making tons of money through droplets. Since we launched in December, we've already paid out $150,000 just in the last 45 days, basically to a group of like 80 creators, which is not insignificant, but also, yeah, they're setting new all time highs all the time on their other stuff because they're picking up new audience members who find out about them through drip and then go explore what else they've been making. And I think it's been very positive for the entirety of the Solana creator community.
00:17:23.604 - 00:17:40.844, Speaker A: Yeah, let's hang on droplets for a second. Walk me through how those work where that actually $145,000 that you guys have paid out is actually coming from, and sort of how these creators are turning that into good old fashioned us dollars, if that's what they want.
00:17:40.924 - 00:18:06.158, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So droplets are not a token. It's an in game currency, if you will. We think of it like an arcade credit. Right? You go to the arcade, you load up your card and you go spend it. And what we designed is this, like two to your system. So you have, users can collect droplets for free every 6 hours.
00:18:06.158 - 00:18:48.374, Speaker B: And if they're paying attention and active, they're collecting, I don't know, $20 to day worth of droplets, which is not insignificant for many people in the world. And then you can also buy them in bulk. And so there's a certain class of users, maybe 1015 percent of them, that are buying 100 for a dollar or 100,000 for $1,000, if you will. And droplets are the thing that unlocks experiences within drip. So one is each time that you. So you subscribe for free to creators, but each time you receive any collectible from them, it spends a droplet from your balance. So you always have to have droplets to receive them.
00:18:48.374 - 00:19:33.298, Speaker B: But you can also donate and put yourself on a leaderboard for a creator. All of our creators have outlined perks that you get for donating. So if you donate 100, hey, you'll get this special edition of this, or if you donate 1000, you'll get access to my discord and you'll get a legendary. So really, there's a full marketplace happening now around this. And every 24 hours, we redeem those droplets for USDC automatically with Solana. Yeah. And this is a big unlock because most of the creator economy tooling around creators has a lot of artificial barriers that are built around payment reels in web two.
00:19:33.426 - 00:19:36.650, Speaker A: Yeah. Patreon is what, like a 10% take rate?
00:19:36.842 - 00:19:50.728, Speaker B: It's more, it's like, depends on your class of creators. So there's like, if you're just starting out, I think it's 8%, and then if you're a pro, it's like 12%. Wow. But that doesn't include the fees, the cash out, all that kind of stuff. Right. And they're kind of forced to. I don't blame them.
00:19:50.728 - 00:20:48.322, Speaker B: I mean, creators get really upset about it. But the reality is that if you swipe your credit card for a dollar subscription on a crater, Patreon is going out and paying a minimum fee, maybe 20, their card provider, and two to three and a half percent of that transaction. So it makes it difficult for them to pay out creators that are kind of below a certain floor. And I think the problem that that creates is that, and the reality that very few want to talk about is that there's so much content on the Internet, most of it is not worth a dollar a month. And to an individual person, I can't afford to pay ten creators for ten pieces of content every month. When I'm consuming thousands of pieces of content every month, pay them $10 a month. That doesn't make any sense.
00:20:48.322 - 00:21:25.328, Speaker B: So drip is, I think the real secret to what we're building is, is actually on that side. It's actually the, it's actually the payments that's the most important thing. Interesting, because we allow these like tiny, tiny increments of subscriptions, one cent a month, half a cent a month, to subscribe to a content creator. And now, now all of a sudden, anyone can subscribe to 100 or 500 and receive all the content that they would want, and they can do it for a very affordable price. And we can pay creators at the tiniest increments too, with Solana. So that's a huge, huge aspect to what we're doing.
00:21:25.456 - 00:21:32.664, Speaker A: Yeah, I kind of love that model because, I mean, people have tried this in broader senses before in some ways.
00:21:32.704 - 00:21:33.128, Speaker B: Bat.
00:21:33.216 - 00:22:00.204, Speaker A: The basic attention token in Brave is sort of an attempt to do something like this and access protocol, which is still early and doing something a little different is trying to do this for written content on sort of more traditional sites. But I don't even think about. I watch a lot of YouTube. Love YouTube. Educational YouTube is like, yeah, it's.
00:22:03.744 - 00:22:04.400, Speaker B: Educational.
00:22:04.432 - 00:22:15.096, Speaker A: YouTube is like a happy place for me. It's like if I'm a little bit too tired to read a book, but still want something to be like, curious about, like, man, get me some material. Sciences engineering videos.
00:22:15.120 - 00:22:17.248, Speaker B: How many creators do you subscribe to on YouTube?
00:22:17.416 - 00:22:24.244, Speaker A: I subscribe to probably 20 channels. And I pay you for YouTube premium.
00:22:24.624 - 00:22:25.320, Speaker B: Sure.
00:22:25.472 - 00:22:37.724, Speaker A: But even in that model, you know, it's like my $7 a month or whatever it is for YouTube premium. It's not going that far for all of these creators, let alone all the other random stuff that I end up watching.
00:22:38.404 - 00:23:39.290, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, it's just an indirect model, right? You're actually not paying for the content that you're consuming at all, you're feeding it into the entirety of their system. And there's all kinds of floors for monetization. Like, some of them may not even be monetized at all, and you have to hit a certain bar for that. I mean, this is exactly where I think making payments accessible really helps. Because the reality is, I mean, maybe you will, but many people will not even be able to pay a dollar per month, per subscription on YouTube. And this, you know, the subscription model, I think one of the reasons why it's such a powerful model for businesses is because it's a subsidization model. Like if you're watching a creators, you're subscribing to New York Times for $5 a month, and you read two articles a month, and your mom is reading the New York Times every day, all day, and that's her primary consumption vehicle.
00:23:39.290 - 00:24:02.770, Speaker B: You're both paying $5 a month. One of you is being very extractive and one of you is not. And the theory is like, oh, well, let's just balance all this balances itself out. But it doesn't, it doesn't, it's a very unfair model. And it actually, like, because of that, it also makes it inaccessible because they have to set a certain price bar.
00:24:02.922 - 00:24:26.604, Speaker A: Yeah, it's that classic thing of like, why is a cable tv, though, especially in the mid two thousands, why is it $130 in the United States? It's like, well, actually, 35 of that is just ESPN. Whether you want it or not, that's how much it costs every cable subscriber. And so in a world of unbundling and sort of breaking apart subscriptions and services, people are really starting to see that cost.
00:24:26.764 - 00:25:12.456, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think drip is much more of an old fashioned kind of approach to it, which is like, you pay for the things that you are using, and it's not, I mean, it really is like a very obvious thing to do. Yeah, we just got trained not to do that. We got trained that you're going to hit a paywall when you go try to find something on the Internet, or you're going to have to pay, you know, $10 a month after your 30 day trial expires to access content. Yeah, and I don't, you know, I mean, I don't know. Netflix is making thousands of shows a year, and I'm watching one of them, and yet I'm paying the same as someone who watches 100 of them. We just, we just take it for granted now that that's how these things should work, and maybe it doesn't have to work that way. That's, that's what I wonder.
00:25:12.560 - 00:25:49.752, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I kind of love that as like a vision and model, too. And also the idea that you're not actually directly subscribing to drip, if you are a user of the platform who comes there and finds new content, you're claiming droplets. And that's awesome. But also, it's not like there's an auto pay. You have to actually opt to top up your balance. You have to opt to claim your drops. That's a really interesting model, too, which feels like it would have been very easy to say, look, the way the platform works is when you sign up, you deposit one soul and we just micro bill you from that.
00:25:49.752 - 00:25:53.304, Speaker A: But you guys have chosen to build it in a much more accessible way.
00:25:54.044 - 00:26:54.538, Speaker B: People need to fall in love with the product, and many crypto products, I think, have too high of a barrier to entry. And if you're starting out with one soul as this current price as your minimum threshold to participate, you just excluded 95% of the world's people and crypto. To me, what I saw in it was that it could be an accessible financial system, and yet we somehow have, in many places, done exactly the opposite. We've made it even more difficult to use and more restrictive than traditional financial rails. Drip started it free, will always start it free. I would definitely, definitely say to every founder out there, how can you make what you're doing 100 times more economical for people, and how can you start it free? And that's something that Solana specifically allows you to do, I think. Yeah.
00:26:54.666 - 00:27:30.242, Speaker A: So I want to go back to last year when you guys raised around. This was not a time when it was easy to fundraise. This is not a product that at the time had a monetization stream attached to it. What were the conversations like? Because most crypto VC's were not looking for projects like drip at the time, and most traditional VC's were too scared to invest in anything that had blockchain involved in it. So what was that vision that convinced a bunch of folks to say, yeah, there's something here, even if we don't know what the end result is yet.
00:27:30.338 - 00:28:08.884, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it was really the conviction of Chris Berniske, ultimately placeholder. Yeah. I mean, it wasn't just like people weren't investing in blockchain, like, people weren't investing in Solana stuff at all. Yeah. In Q one last year, and I don't blame them, but it was like it took a lot of vision to dig in at that time with the startups in the scene. And yeah, I think he saw what we saw, which was like, there's something interesting here. Again, the fact that it makes people uncomfortable but it continues to grow is kind of a very good thing.
00:28:08.884 - 00:28:24.588, Speaker B: And obviously we had a very good team. So, yeah, I don't know when he agreed to do it, then everyone else wanted to do it, so from there it was easy. But yeah, he has some big cojones for sure. Yeah.
00:28:24.676 - 00:28:30.468, Speaker A: I will say also Chris Berniski, one of the nicest and most helpful investors you will ever meet.
00:28:30.596 - 00:28:48.620, Speaker B: He's. Yeah, he's different. He's different. He's so calm. He got surfer vibes at all times. I don't you call him with any problem and he's a lot of crypto VC's are more like trader types. He actually has a trading background.
00:28:48.620 - 00:28:56.824, Speaker B: He's quite a good one, I think, but he's also very patient and yeah, we really like to work with him. Please send him this clip.
00:28:59.374 - 00:29:48.720, Speaker A: So before drip there was spaces, and before spaces there was beta. And I actually, I think I met you back in 2015 when a startup I was working for actually had a product that they were placing in one of the Palo alto Beta stores. So talk to me a little bit about the process of pivoting from an organization that was like high end, high touch retail to something that was crypto focused to something that now is almost the opposite of all that. You've left the physical world entirely. It's not working with products, it's working with content. What was that process like as a founder of going through all those ups and downs and finding something now that really seems to have really stuck?
00:29:48.832 - 00:30:42.580, Speaker B: Yeah. Life's pursuit is to build things that, and especially to build things that challenge the structures and business models that we have out there today. I mean, Beta was really nothing more than an idea to kind of rearrange the economics of retail. And then, you know, I mean, it wasn't a simple idea, but bringing that to life was a process of convincing people that the old system was wrong and they should try something different. And for some reason I've always, yeah, I've definitely always had a contrarian view on these kinds of things. So I think from that perspective, many of the things I've worked on have a similar outlook. And if you think about drip, it's very much, hey, maybe the business model that you've been pitched on nfts is wrong.
00:30:42.580 - 00:31:15.124, Speaker B: And there's something else that could be built. And, yeah, the opportunity with Solana spaces was not so dissimilar. I mean, I think I had spent many years building these kind of high tech, high touch stores. And it seemed to me like crypto was widely misunderstood. Even during the bull market. It was. I mean, there was a lot of euphoria, but for many people it still felt, and for me, honestly couldn't understand what was going on in the space.
00:31:15.124 - 00:31:57.094, Speaker B: But I wanted to learn. And the challenge of like, building a retail experience that was accessible and was designed for someone who had no idea what was going on seemed very interesting. And drip is still a manifestation of that because, yeah, I mean, the things we learned building Solana space is about onboarding people into our space. We're invaluable. We've been pitching crypto entirely the wrong way to everybody. And that's why our space is dominated by traders and not retail users yet. And drips is going to fix that.
00:31:57.214 - 00:31:59.326, Speaker A: What do you think is the right way to pitch crypto?
00:31:59.470 - 00:33:03.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been thinking about it as the new Internet. It's the Internet where things work differently than what you're used to, but you as a user have more control. And in theory, your experience is more favorable in different ways. I mean, I think the very, just imagine pitching someone on, here's Amazon, here's decentralized Amazon, and in this version, and imagine all the things were equal. But in this version, you own a piece of the company and you're benefiting from the economics of that business. And when you don't, people will prefer the one where they have ownership and have a say and where they're benefiting economically. And so, yeah, the new Internet is really the way for me, and it's art, and it's art and content because everyone understands that mental model.
00:33:03.494 - 00:33:15.986, Speaker B: And the fact that it's digital is uncomfortable at first, but it doesn't take so long to appreciate what it means to own something on chain like that.
00:33:16.130 - 00:33:34.526, Speaker A: Yeah, it's sort of like to go back to the YouTube analogy. There was a few years when people making films for YouTube were laughed at by Hollywood, and then those people started getting invited to Hollywood to make films. It feels like we're kind of in that same gap right now.
00:33:34.710 - 00:33:46.646, Speaker B: Yeah. And people are used to paying for digital goods, right. I mean, we do have, you know, I mean, you and I grew up buying software in boxes. And I know there's a lot of.
00:33:46.670 - 00:33:48.430, Speaker A: Like, we are old, aren't we?
00:33:48.622 - 00:34:30.394, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. But, but even today, there's been a big controversy around the big game companies switching from ownership model to a licensing model. And the reason why is that it's not fair. People actually do want to own the things that they pay for, and that's digital stuff. That's software. So I think, to me, if someone can believe that you own a piece of software on your computer that you bought for and you paid for, the leap from there to other things that are digital, that can be owned, is not so great. But the way we present blockchains today is decentralized.
00:34:30.394 - 00:34:36.734, Speaker B: It's very much like, fight the system.
00:34:36.854 - 00:34:42.338, Speaker A: It assumes everyone has already bought in on the vision of blockchain while you're pitching them.
00:34:42.486 - 00:35:08.626, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And you, like, somehow, like, no matter what, you always end up going back to Satoshi and, like, the banking crisis in 2008, right. To explain everything. And, like, honestly, nobody cares. Yeah, I mean, some people do, but not that many. Like, what most people want is, like, just better experiences. And drip, I really think drip is that, like.
00:35:08.626 - 00:35:42.134, Speaker B: I think drip is a better content consumption experience. I think it takes people back. I get comments all the time. This feels like Tumblr, or this feels like the early days of these Internet content protocols, before it got messy with ads and election controversies, all that kind of stuff. It takes you back to a simpler time. And I don't take it as a given that the things that came before today are going to be here forever. I think we can build better things.
00:35:42.134 - 00:35:43.854, Speaker B: Love it.
00:35:44.674 - 00:35:56.854, Speaker A: Do you have any advice you would give founders who maybe thought they were building backend technology companies and are now finding themselves in building much more user facing products and services?
00:35:59.034 - 00:36:00.026, Speaker B: Like in Solana.
00:36:00.130 - 00:36:00.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:02.734 - 00:37:00.138, Speaker B: So, yeah, I kind of mentioned a few things. I think starting it free is very, very important, but I think what crypto specifically allows you to do is not only to start it free, but to actually give people real financial incentives from very early days. Now it's a, you know, it can be a deal with the devil, because you give people things for free, and then you have farming and you have airdrop hunters and you have Sybil problems and all these kind of things. But it really is a catalyst for growing fast. And so drip is not a non financial product. I mean, it is a financial product very deeply. But we, we felt comfortable subsidizing the uses of the product for a long time.
00:37:00.138 - 00:37:27.102, Speaker B: And I think if you're struggling for growth today, put on your lens about what people really want. And what people really want is to have fun, but also to be rewarded. And there's many, many things that are in the web two space that I think can be reinvented with these kind of better incentives. There's just, yeah, there's tons and tons to be built right now. I mean, like, literally everything in web two can be disrupted, I believe. Yeah.
00:37:27.238 - 00:37:37.366, Speaker A: Love it. Well, for artists listening, how can they get involved in drip? For aspiring collectors, how can they start collecting?
00:37:37.470 - 00:38:00.492, Speaker B: The best thing to do is to follow drip house on Twitter. I refuse to call it X. It's Twitter to me. You go to our link in our bio, and there you'll find an application form to join. You. Also find an invite code to jointrip for free. As a collector, if you ever have any problems, you can dm the account and we'll take care of you.
00:38:00.628 - 00:38:03.812, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, Fibu, thank you for coming on validated.
00:38:03.908 - 00:38:04.444, Speaker B: Thank you. Austin.
