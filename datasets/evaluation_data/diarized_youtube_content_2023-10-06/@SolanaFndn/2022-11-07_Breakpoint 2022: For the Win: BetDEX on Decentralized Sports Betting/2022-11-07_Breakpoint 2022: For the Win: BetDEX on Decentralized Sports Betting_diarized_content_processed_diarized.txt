00:00:03.960 - 00:00:27.754, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. It's great to be here. So my name is Nigel Eccles and I'm joined by my colleague here, Varun Sudecker. Go to the first slide and show some of our background. So other one to note is our third co founder and hardest working co founder, Stuart Tonner, who's our CTo. He's giving a talk tomorrow about the Monaco protocol. You want to see it? That is basically what we built BetDex on.
00:00:27.754 - 00:00:47.246, Speaker A: Give a quick background by myself. I've been involved in the sports betting industry for over 20 years. I've launched countless products in that market. This is actually the third betting exchange I've ever launched. A betting exchange. Just so you know, different from a sports book. With a sports book, you're playing against the house.
00:00:47.246 - 00:01:04.066, Speaker A: With a betting exchange. It's much more like, say, the New York Stock Exchange. You're playing against other customers. That's really important. We'll come into that later on in the talk. A colleague here, Varun, is going to talk about what we're launching and our launch date. So you want to hang around for that.
00:01:04.066 - 00:01:28.764, Speaker A: It's really, really exciting. So firstly, I want to talk about the size of the market. Sports betting is big. We estimate about $2 trillion is bet on sports globally every year. That puts us somewhere on a par of the GDP of either Italy or India. This is a really large market. And so sometimes people say, well, hey, it's a really large market.
00:01:28.764 - 00:02:02.038, Speaker A: What's the problem? Why does it need web3? You could say web3 is this big, slow database that's really hard to develop on. Why are we bringing this technology? What's the innovation? So let me cover that and then what Varuna is going to talk to you about is what we're building. One of the first problems with the sports betting market might not seem like a problem. There's tons of choice. There's probably like 10,000 different sites that you can bet on in sports today. So really fragmented. So lots of choice.
00:02:02.038 - 00:02:29.734, Speaker A: But the problem is that from that there's two things. One is that because there's so many different sites, there's an underinvestment in the product. So a lot of these products are not web two products. These are actually web one products. These are basic HTML products that show odds. And when we talk about payment reels for some of these products, the payment reels is a guy, I literally mean a guy. A guy.
00:02:29.734 - 00:02:59.716, Speaker A: You give money to that you go back to the website and you see that your balance has been updated. So that's what you're competing with. And the products themselves kind of suck. They're not mobile friendly, they don't work well. Secondly, because of the huge amount of fragmentation, these are small liquidity pools. So sure, if you want to put a $10 bet on maybe even $100 bet, you're fine. But if you want to put on a large bet, like a $10,000 bet, you're going to be out of luck with nearly every one of these sites.
00:02:59.716 - 00:03:32.372, Speaker A: So these are fragmented liquidity pulls. But say, hey, ok, you're going to work with one of the larger operators, one that's had more investment, say like a bet 365 or my former company, Fondo. Well, what problem then? High fees, right? In the crypto world, we see like 2%. We're like, oh my God, 2%? That's ridiculous. In the sports betting world, 2% would be an incredible deal. Here's just a typical market where it's basically a coin flip. It's betting the over under.
00:03:32.372 - 00:04:05.724, Speaker A: If you're not familiar with us betting, typically one of the popular bets is to bet the total number of odds scored in the game and it set a line, which is about average. And so this should be like a coin flip. You should bet $10, you should win $10. Here you bet $10 and you can win between seven and $8. That works out at about a 12% margin. But some other bets, you can see up to a 40% margin on bets like a parlay. This is not an industry that really competes on price, and that's a massive problem.
00:04:05.724 - 00:04:54.264, Speaker A: If you're a serious bettor but you're a degen, you want to bet, you pick a brand that can take your scale, you're willing to eat these high margins. What's your next problem? Your next problem is according to these sites, it's not really your money. They will lock up your money. They will basically put in obstacles like say, hey, you need to play through your money five times before you can withdraw it. And even when you do that, they will put in other obstacles that prevent you from withdrawing. And why do they do that? Because they know if you keep your money on site, you're more likely to re bet with it again. So, okay, you're still a DJ and you want to bet, you pick a brand that you like, you're willing to eat the high margins and you're willing to accept the fact that once you put your money in, it's probably going to take you a long time to get it out.
00:04:54.264 - 00:05:19.952, Speaker A: What's the next problem? Get up the next morning, site's not there. So a lot of these entities are regulated in jurisdictions where regulation doesn't really exist. It happens, and it's happened quite frequently, where some of these sites just disappear. There's no recourse at that point. You've been rug pulled. Your money is gone. So you still want to bet.
00:05:19.952 - 00:05:41.378, Speaker A: You're willing to accept the fact that the site that you put your money in might be gone. You're willing to accept that even if you bet with a regulated site, it might take you days or weeks to get your money out. You're also willing to accept that you're going to have to bet. Really high margins. Okay, now you're good, surely. But actually, what's this? So this is an actual screenshot. This is not from my account.
00:05:41.378 - 00:06:15.244, Speaker A: This is somebody who shared it on Twitter, goes in to put a bet, finds out it's restricted to $4.07. I love the $0.07. That is the maximum that site will let that user bet. Why would that be? Very simple. The reason is that user is a winning customer. A lot of people don't actually understand, and they're not in the betting industry, is that the betting industry restricts winning customers. So let me just say that again, the betting industry restricts winning customers.
00:06:15.244 - 00:07:05.464, Speaker A: They are very, very happy to take your money if you lose consistently. But if you win, they will restrict you or even close your account. So the point here is if you're consistently betting tens, hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars with any of these accounts, like bet 365, my old company, Fanduel DraftKings, you're consistently betting you are a loser. Industry doesn't want that to come out, but you are a loser. And the reason that we know you're a loser and is because they're taking your money, because if they are taking your money, it means that you are losing. Now, we at bets sort of feel that sucks. I don't want to have to deal with all of these issues and I certainly don't want to believe that the only reason they're taking my money is I'm losing.
00:07:05.464 - 00:07:22.084, Speaker A: And one of the biggest reasons you're losing is you're paying between twelve and 30% margin. And so we think there's a better way. And that's why a year ago, myself, Varun and Stuart started working on BetDex. And Varun here is going to talk about that in a moment.
00:07:23.624 - 00:08:13.074, Speaker B: Thanks, Nigel. So you all heard a little bit about how big the sports betting industry is and how it's kind of rife with the number of problems which provide a pretty poor user experience. What I want to talk a little bit about is what we're building and how BetDex actually solves those problems. So first of all, what is BetDex? What you're looking at up here is a picture of the BetX exchange. This is an on chain, non custodial p two p sports betting exchange. The exchange has been in closed beta since July and it's been in open beta since early October. Since it's been on open beta, we've actually had over 12,000 unique wallets come in access to Bettech's exchange and actually place trades through our platform.
00:08:13.074 - 00:08:51.006, Speaker B: So the exchange is fully licensed and regulated. We announced the licensing last week. We've been licensed by the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission. I believe this is actually one of the first instances of a regulator such as this licensing and on chain non custodial sports betting exchange that's built on the blockchain and on Solana. This license allows us to access about 40% of the world's population. Furthermore, as I mentioned before, the Bettex exchange is a completely non custodial platform. We never touch your money.
00:08:51.006 - 00:09:27.506, Speaker B: We actually never even hold it all. The Bettex exchange is serves as an interface for you to actually go and place wagers on an underlying protocol which we'll talk a little bit about later. Once the wager is placed, all wagers are going to be transparent on chain. You'll be able to see the smart contract that they're placed on. All the smart contracts have been audited and are all publicly available. And lastly, and most importantly, as it relates to payments, once settlement is triggered, once a match is finished, the wagers immediately come back directly to your wallet. No more.
00:09:27.506 - 00:10:21.092, Speaker B: Do you have to go to a sportsbook, try to request to get your money back, have to wait two or three days for it to hit your bank account, or even more so, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I actually asked for the sportsbook to send you a check, which is, I kid you not, it is still common to this day. Winners are also welcome on our platform. We do not. We're not going to look at the player profile, look at the ROI, and then restrict you or kick you off our platform because you are an ROI positive player. We're not going to hit you with a special premium charge because you're a high ROI player either. The natural question becomes, why are we able to do this? And why do we think that we can do this when other companies in the industry aren't able to. And this is because the Bettex exchange, it's built on top of the Monaco protocol.
00:10:21.092 - 00:11:04.254, Speaker B: So what the Monaco protocol is, it's an open source infrastructure for sports betting. It's basically an on chain order book and matching algorithm. It's permissionless and it's decentralized. The Monaco protocol allows you to pull liquidity across different dapps, leading to tighter spreads and really allowing us to offer a much better experience and much lower fees. If you are interested in learning more about the Monaco protocol, there actually is a talk tomorrow that Stuart, our other cofounder and CTO, is providing. You can also go to www dot Monacaprotocol, dot XYZ and see the dive documentation of the GitHub that's over there. So what's next? I've been, I think, since we started this company a year ago.
00:11:04.254 - 00:11:45.334, Speaker B: The most common question I receive on crypto Twitter is one mainnet. There we go. So happy to announce and extremely excited and proud to announce the bedtex exchange will be on Mainnet on November 17, right in time for the World cup. You will be able to come and wager with real money on the Betx exchange on the mono. And I am also happy to announce that during the World cup there will be no commissions charged by the Betx exchange. So all trades will be commission free. Thank you.
00:11:45.334 - 00:12:20.946, Speaker B: I can't believe I'm here. I think it was last year, a few of us were just wandering around Lisbon. We had this idea in an eight page slide deck and now we've come this far to come and achieve this milestone. Been a lot of work that's gone into this and I really hope to see a lot of you guys on the product in just a few weeks. Lastly, I wanted to mention if you guys do want to come and experience the product. We are hosting a watch party for the Liverpool and Spurs game right down the street. It's about a 20 minutes walk.
00:12:20.946 - 00:12:39.534, Speaker B: Would love to see you there if you want to come and meet the team. More than welcome to. We will also be having a gambling contest using our dap. So yeah, we'd love to come and see everyone there. Thank you everyone. Thank you.
