00:00:07.720 - 00:00:31.705, Speaker A: Gm. Gm. Can everyone hear me? Can everyone hear me? All right. Welcome everyone. Thank you for coming today for Rangers keynote. And today I'll be presenting what Ranger is actually about. Ranger's vision is to unlock the potential of markets and the way we want to do so is to solve for fragmentation.
00:00:31.705 - 00:01:06.535, Speaker A: Fragmentation. There's three different levels to fragmentation. Firstly, data fragmentation. Secondly, liquidity fragmentation, and thirdly, market fragmentation. Data fragmentation is a large problem in Solana and also in the whole crypto space. The way we want to solve for data fragmentation is to harmonize the data access as well as aggregate defi data on Solana. In the end, we want to be a hub for all defi data on Solana.
00:01:06.535 - 00:01:41.585, Speaker A: Now, liquidity is always a very large issue. Fragmented liquidity especially. This is because liquidity moves from one place to the other because of various factors. Firstly, it is due to new protocols coming up or secondly, incentives at Ranger. We want to solve this by having a smart order router. Now how does it work? It's pretty simple. A large order comes in and we break it up into smaller pieces which we routed to multiple Dexes.
00:01:41.585 - 00:02:21.515, Speaker A: Now how are you as a user going to use Ranger? The first thing you want to go to is the data page itself and you'll see that the funding rates of Jupiter and Flash are the lowest. You want to place an order, so you head over to our trading page and let's say you're a big whale. You want to place a massive order, so you place a 4.2 mil order on Ranger. It's because we can spot it. You place the order and we show you the available routes which we previously mentioned. Jupiter as well as Flash.
00:02:21.515 - 00:03:14.835, Speaker A: We'll also show you the price impact as well as the available liquidity on both platforms. We execute the order for you and just like that you will be able to see both positions on Ranger. Now, speaking about liquidity, we also want to push the boundaries of liquidity. This is why we're announcing a strategic partnership together with Asgard. We want to introduce Spot margin and for you you'll be able to trade spot up to 10x. Now we'd like to share some stats with you we've achieved over the past few months. Firstly, we managed to come close to 40k signups on Ranger as well as up to 100mil monthly committed volume.
00:03:14.835 - 00:03:47.575, Speaker A: Now, solving for data fragmentation as well as liquidity fragmentation are just two steps to our bigger vision. We want to unite Defi and the way we are doing so is to introduce your three other perp Dexes into our smart order router, the Spot and Spot Margin, a P2P OTC, as well as on and off ramps. We hope that you can join our journey into unlocking the potential of markets. Thank you.
