00:00:01.760 - 00:01:04.314, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome. So happy to have you all join us in Lisbon. Excited for the programming this afternoon. My name is Yelena Kavanaugh. I'm the general counsel at the Solana foundation, and I'm joined today by an esteemed group of crypto lawyers who have been in the game pretty much from the start of it all to discuss some of the legal challenges and considerations that devs are confronting as they think through their projects and working in the current regulatory climate. I think that we can all acknowledge that it's not the easiest space to navigate, even from practitioners, and it's all but impossible, even for those of us who live and breathe this work, to stay abreast of all the policy considerations and legal opinions and coming down the pike, including through the former channels and the Twitter sphere.
00:01:04.314 - 00:01:52.944, Speaker A: So breakpoint and this discussion is really oriented towards devs, the heartbeat of the Solana community. And really, our hope today is to leave devs and projects at least with a semblance of more clarity in how to navigate the blurred lines of the regulatory landscape. I would be remiss if I didn't do the lawyer thing and just want to remind everyone that anything that is set here does not constitute legal or financial advice, and the views of myself and the speakers are our own and should not be ascribed to their respective organizations, which we present. So without further ado, I'd love for our esteemed panelists to each introduce themselves and give a quick overview of how they got into the space.
00:01:54.484 - 00:02:43.232, Speaker B: Liz, thank you so much. Elena, it's a pleasure to be here. My name is Lewis Cohen. I'm a co founder of a boutique law firm in the US called DLX law, and we have offices in New York, Delaware, and Washington. I came to the space from very much a tradfi background. I did a lot of work with large banks and issuers of securities and spent a lot of time thinking about what is a security? How do we comply with these laws? And when I discovered blockchain, I said, oh my goodness, we've really found something unique and interesting and a new way to solve problems. And as I say in my pin tweet and my Twitter, I don't think we need a thousand new payment mechanisms, but we absolutely need a thousand new marketplaces and business models that blockchain allows.
00:02:43.232 - 00:02:45.004, Speaker B: So very excited about that.
00:02:45.864 - 00:03:26.684, Speaker C: I'm Karen Yubel. I'm a partner at Goblin Proctor, based in San Francisco. I got into this space while I was working at the securities and Exchange Commission. So the Winklevoss filed the bitcoin ETF, and at that point in time, we had to decide whether bitcoin was more like a commodity or a security. We decided it was more like a commodity. That was a long time ago. And yet here we are, still with a lot of uncertainty coloring this industry, and then rejoined private practice and now work 100% with developers, investors, exchanges, really, the entire ecosystem.
00:03:27.904 - 00:04:16.354, Speaker D: Nancy Wiljas. I am the head of the blockchain and cryptocurrency group at Cooley LLP. Been in the business, in the crypto business since 2017, when a client of ours wanted to do a token offering and we had brought on a new partner. Karen was a colleague at that point in time, and he was supposed to handle everything. 2017 hit and it was off to the races, and I found cryptocurrency interesting from both a policy and just a really fast meaning, technology. So it's been full tech, you know, full cryptocurrency and blockchain technology since then.
00:04:17.014 - 00:04:49.918, Speaker A: Great. So before we dive in into some of the practical consideration, I think it would be helpful to orient the audience around the current high level regulatory scheme in the US. And candidly, this is a us centric discussion, as we are us bard lawyers. But I want to acknowledge that there are other jurisdictions, and blockchain is, you know, worldwide. So this conversation is largely circumscribed to a us discussion, but we shouldn't forget about the rest of the world. Lewis, could you kick us off there?
00:04:50.086 - 00:05:10.012, Speaker B: Sure. Thanks, Yelena. I know for Devs, this can sometimes seem somewhat impenetrable of a concept which laws apply, why and where. When you think about this as a dev, there's probably a couple of places to start, and I feel like the mics are going in and out. Is that just me or no?
00:05:10.068 - 00:05:11.372, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe try and move it a little closer.
00:05:11.428 - 00:05:55.604, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. So the first thing to think about when you have a. A decentralized blockchain based project that you're trying to launch is, of necessity, there's going to be a token that functions as, in some way a control factor or an economic driver of what you're doing. And the question arises then, well, what exactly is it that this token is? It's clearly, you know, to some extent a bit of software, but it also has economic value. And there's this question which Karen alluded to. Is it a security or is it not a security? This is such a foundational point that as a developer, you really need to work with lawyers early on. The question really comes in two pieces.
00:05:55.604 - 00:06:56.150, Speaker B: The first piece is that if you're raising funds directly or indirectly through a sale or a promise of a token, very likely, from a us point of view, those would be securities transactions, to be very careful about not making offers of those, those transactions to the general public. So, for example, a website, hey, come here, buy my token, fund me. As we saw in the ICO boom, many, many of those led to enforcement actions. But there's a second related question that you need to think about. What happens when my token starts trading out there. Is it still a security if it's no longer being involved in fundraising? And that's really where most of the argument is right now, the SEC in the US is strongly asserting that even when token trades on Coinbase or Gemini, or in a dex like uniswap or Pancakeswap, those are still securities transactions. If the SEC prevails on that, that will be problematic.
00:06:56.150 - 00:07:35.256, Speaker B: When you talk to your lawyers, you want to think about both aspects, my fundraising aspect, and also my token. Even if the token is not a security, it could be viewed as a commodity. And certain commodities transactions are also highly regulated. We'll talk a little bit more about Oki Dao and the problems it ran into. Those are derivatives transactions and not straight up token transactions. But nevertheless, our commodities laws in the US can apply as well. It's very unclear, because why wouldn't it be? Whether a given token that's not, does not have a futures market would be considered regulated by our regulator here.
00:07:35.256 - 00:08:22.734, Speaker B: Well, there in the US commodities Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC. But that's something you want to think about. And then the final big picture thing you want to think about and talk about with your lawyers is either your token, a convertible virtual currency, that is something that's subject to money regulation, or are you acting in some way as either an exchanger or an administrator of a convertible virtual currency? And if you are, what regulations apply to you? Those are money oriented regulations in the United States. Those are overseen by a part of our treasury department called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. So when you start your journey, ask those questions early on, and I think you'll have a much more productive sort of development journey for your. For your product that you're doing.
00:08:22.894 - 00:09:17.426, Speaker D: So, Louis, that's the current state of affairs. And I think as a developer, you're going to have to think about the future. To next year, we're going to see activity out of Congress. There are 75 bills right now being, you know, talked about in Congress. Our midterm elections may determine exactly what goes on next year, but we are going to see some regulation out of Congress. My guess would be, secondly, I think the SEC is, notwithstanding my constant complaint about them, and I started out at the SEC as a lawyer there, they've been sitting on their collective behinds for this entire time. It was like a surprise to them that there was cryptocurrency and oh, my God, we got to stop it.
00:09:17.426 - 00:09:31.514, Speaker D: So how did they stop it? They said everything's a security. It's our jurisdiction. Come in and we'll talk to you about it and we'll tell you how to do it. And we all know that that hasn't gone very well, right?
00:09:33.134 - 00:09:46.454, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. I think right now we're in a period of great flux, and I think certainly, as you said, Nancy, I think paying attention to the elections is going to be very important. There are a number of important bills.
00:09:46.614 - 00:10:22.214, Speaker A: That are out there, as promised. I do want to keep it oriented towards practical considerations devs actually can take away from here as they think through their respective projects. I would love, Karen, to hear from you when a new project comes to you, hopefully early and not down the line, when they've already launched kind of a framework for thinking through even what they should be thinking through initially, maybe even starting from basic principles like setting up the infrastructure and incorporating.
00:10:22.674 - 00:11:22.384, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, as Lewis has said, it's nice to have your lawyers involved a little bit early. And don't think that we're coming in to tell you you can't do things. We're there to. Actually, I view my job as trying to help you guys achieve and kind of push the boundary of what you want to achieve, but doing it in the least risky way possible that we can get you there but still achieving your business objectives. And so, first of all, usually what we're thinking about is, should I form an entity? Where should I form that entity? There's a lot of discussion about whether it's offshore or onshore. One thing I think that you want to keep in mind is if you have a token or if you have a protocol or a project that people can access from the US, or a token that ends up in the hands of us holders, then you're going to have to kind of deal with the elephant in the room of us regulation. So there are some benefits of being offshore, but a lot of companies that we work with do start in the US as a Delaware entity.
00:11:22.384 - 00:12:17.366, Speaker C: You want to have that limited liability benefit for yourself as you're building and as you're starting to think through what that product is going to look like. But generally thinking about the product itself, it's a very unusual thing. But oftentimes you have having your lawyer as part of that initial. Here's how we're thinking about what we're building and taking what Lewis mentioned, the different regulatory agencies and buckets, and we can just help you say based on what you're doing. Here's, it's the SEC probably Fincen that you're going to think about. Are there some tweaks here that maybe we can make that would take you out of those buckets? And really at that very early stage, thinking about some guardrails and helping you all think through. If I head this way, what risks am I going to encounter? But if I stay in this lane, maybe that's a little bit simpler and a little lower risk for you.
00:12:17.366 - 00:12:52.290, Speaker C: So I think what we're trying to do is really think through that framework. Right now. For me personally, what I am looking and advising folks is really leading with your product, building out their product, finding good product market fit, finding users, and getting to that place where you have both functionality and decentralization, and then later looking to say, okay, now this token is a big part of what I'm building, but now we have a great user base that understands the product and it's much cleaner to roll that out.
00:12:52.442 - 00:13:25.234, Speaker B: I'll just maybe quickly pick up on the location because you're chatting about this and I think it's very bespoke. So be sure as a dev team that the lawyers you talk to understand all of the facts involved. So many dev teams are just Us folks, based in the US, funded by us people. That's one set of facts, as Karen said. But many teams are non us people or based outside of the US and funded by non us people. So facts like that can make a real difference. It's really important to be upfront and make sure your lawyers don't have a single playbook that they're applying.
00:13:25.234 - 00:13:34.176, Speaker B: But folks like, you know, Nancy and Karen are going to examine all of the facts and then make a recommendation that's right for you based on your particular circumstances.
00:13:34.360 - 00:13:35.048, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:13:35.136 - 00:14:23.324, Speaker D: The one thing that we see a lot with devs is they come in, they form their entity, and they're incredibly generous. They're not thinking long term, and within months you find there are arguments between the founders and they end up spending a lot of money trying to correct what, you know, initially they thought, oh, yeah, you know, this person's great for my project because, you know, he's only working 20 hours a week. But, you know, he's really a co founder, you know, and in two months, it's. Well, he's not even showing up anymore. So think seriously about how you are structuring your. Your documents. And there are a lot of free resources out there.
00:14:23.324 - 00:14:32.680, Speaker D: One cooligo. You can form your corporation. You know, it's a document generator. There are other law firms out there. I think Goodwin has one.
00:14:32.752 - 00:14:33.848, Speaker C: Founders workbench.
00:14:33.896 - 00:14:35.040, Speaker D: Yes, I'm sorry.
00:14:35.072 - 00:14:36.208, Speaker C: It's called founders Workbench.
00:14:36.256 - 00:14:54.174, Speaker D: Yep. Yeah. So there are things that you can do. Like, I hate clerky. We have to redo their documents all the time. Go to a real law firm site, and you're able to do things pretty much on the cheap. When people come to me, I tell them to do that.
00:14:54.174 - 00:15:15.952, Speaker D: But read what you're doing, because inevitably, just recently, we've just spent time, because, for example, there's something called an 83 b election. We give very specific directions. Klein didn't do it. We had to undo everything. So be careful when you use those resources.
00:15:16.128 - 00:15:33.764, Speaker A: So aside from the legal structuring considerations, as you know, most projects are interested in potentially launching a token down the road. Would love to hear kind of some guardrails around. Thinking through the token launch process in a relatively uncertain environment.
00:15:38.464 - 00:16:15.440, Speaker B: I'll start with guardrails. Thank you. One thing, Yelena, just to pick up on a point Nancy made that I really like to amplify, and that is who is in the team. And as you grow the team, we worry a lot about the potential for enforcement actions. And one of the largest, most primary sources of things going wrong are team members who are disgruntled. And so keeping a happy family is really one of the best guardrails you can have. Disgruntled former team members are often pick up a phone and call an enforcement person, said, hey, I got screwed here, and come look at this.
00:16:15.440 - 00:16:51.004, Speaker B: So I think that's a great point from Nancy. Other things you want to think about from a very early stage are communications about your project. What are you saying and how are you saying it? Regulators are very fond of dredging up tweets, and they'll even get into discord if it's public. And look at a lot of places, you know, starting discipline early with your colleagues around what you're focused on. You're focused on building a project. You know, you're not focused primarily on creating a token that's going to rocket ship up to the moon. So I think those are, those are some really important things to think about.
00:16:51.004 - 00:16:51.356, Speaker B: Karen.
00:16:51.380 - 00:17:51.894, Speaker C: Nancy, I would just really emphasize that. Just being very careful about that. We saw with the Coinbase, the SEC's case against the Coinbase employee, Wahe, where they named nine different assets as securities. Every single thing that they used in that complaint came from public statements, from the mouth of the CEO, directors, employees, discord statements, medium posts, tweets were very, very popular fodder for the SEC. So something I usually kind of say is don't talk about the token except as part of the technology that you're building and really focus on your own technology. How is it working? How is it valuable? And when I say valuable, I mean not, oh, this is going to the moon. How is this going to create new ways for people to interact? How is it taking blockchain technology and actually creating something new and interesting and allowing people to use that technology?
00:17:52.334 - 00:18:26.194, Speaker D: So in websites, you know, I have a project right now, or somebody wants to come to us. I looked at their website, NFT project. The entire website was how much money you can make. And it's like, you know, it is a concern. And the SEC will start its opening brief with the complaints saying, this CEO said this and it's a loser case. I'm telling you so.
00:18:26.894 - 00:18:58.932, Speaker C: And things can be taken out of context, very definitely. I think we all know that from Twitter, just in and of itself, right? But things can be taken out of context so easily. And so you do have to be careful. And I know that when you're small, it might be easier to do that on a one off basis as a communications team. But as you grow really controlling for that through a communications policy, or having one person that is tweeting on behalf of your project or your company really kind of having tight controls over that and around your messaging, I'll pick up.
00:18:58.948 - 00:19:55.584, Speaker B: On one more point on this theme, and that is to think about the underlying business model. I think with token projects, people sometimes focus exclusively on the token that they're creating. Eating, the question really arises, is there an equity business model there alongside this, or is this really just all you're seeking to do is get the token out there and step away, if you can, where it's appropriate. Having a separate business model can be very valuable to making it clear to someone who looks at this that you're a technology company and you have sources of revenue, but you also have adjacent protocol that you use along with many other folks. In a litigated case in New Hampshire right now, the protocol did not really have a good answer to this, and it was considered really problematic. If your only business of the labs entity is making money from selling the token. That's going to be concerning.
00:19:55.584 - 00:20:09.436, Speaker B: So you should think about your business model and talk to your counsel about what your business model is and how it all fits together, the token part. And then is there a separate kind of revenue based model. So I think that's something to think about as well.
00:20:09.540 - 00:20:56.598, Speaker A: That's great. Thank you, guys. On that note, would love to kind of dive in into trapsworthy and wary. I think this is a strange space where non lawyers can verbatim recite four prongs of a Supreme Court test, namely, howie, you know, I think some folks in the community have come to simplistic conclusions. If NFT, not a token, if I institute this Dao governance, I'm somehow insulated. Would love to hear from you just kind of, when you've picked up clients who've kind of gone down that kind of path. So to provide some guidance for unwary.
00:20:56.766 - 00:21:52.064, Speaker C: I think one thing that's top of mind right now, right, is if Dao, no regulation, and that's definitely not true. If Dao, no tax, also not true. You know, I think that there are a lot of folks that think, you know, here, if I'm decentralized, then no one's really responsible, and therefore no one's really responsible. And I think with the CFTC action against Uki, I mean, that was another, I don't know what the consensus is on how we pronounce that, but I think that, you know, I think we saw this idea where, you know, you had a couple of founders that said, okay, I mean, I think they back to our comms message. I think they actually said, well, now that we're decentralized, they can't come after us now. And I don't think that's ever been, you know, a successful legal strategy. And so they of course said, it doesn't matter that, you know, it was, you know, this thing was illegal when it was centralized, it's still illegal when it's decentralized.
00:21:52.064 - 00:22:55.684, Speaker C: And then they've come up with some rather concerning precedent, if it becomes a precedent, but rather concerning approach to saying who is then responsible? And they took the approach that it's everybody who ever voted on anything. So even if you voted no, then we shouldn't be doing this. You still could be liable. And so that's going to be really interesting from a governance perspective, figuring out now, again, just kind of, again, showing how things change so quickly in this space. From a legal perspective, we were trying to endow governance tokens with a lot of authority over the DAO and the protocol and the ecosystem and the community. And now we're going to probably see that start to shift as people become maybe more reticent to, to be voting and being active members. So again, this is also why you gotta check back in with your lawyers, because very small things can have a big influence and can change kind of how they may be advising you on your approach.
00:22:57.344 - 00:23:44.094, Speaker D: So, yeah, that's a very, very scary case. And the jurisdiction that they're trying to exert on us is just truly amazing. But again, check with your lawyers. And we've always been more concerned about the SEC. Again, Nancy, the cynic believes that the CFTC is trying to demonstrate to the Congress, saying, hey, we are a strong enforcer of laws and we should be the primary enforcer. So I think they're taking a unique position. Honestly, going after everybody who ever voted is mind boggling to me.
00:23:45.274 - 00:24:21.074, Speaker A: I think we have just a couple of minutes left and I think we could sit here all day. I'm sure not everyone would love that, but I'd love to. Like kind of the last question, and in line with the 24/7 news cycle yesterday, there was an article that came out by a protocol that has directly engaged with the regulators and has reached certain conclusions. Would just love to hear your thoughts about how to engage, when to engage, and general thoughts about whether more projects will take that approach going forward.
00:24:21.614 - 00:25:19.412, Speaker B: Quickly pick up on that. So the project announced yesterday that they had concluded that their token had, quote unquote, morphed or somehow change from being a security to being a non security. And I think it was well intended, but concerning, because based on the announcement, the project had engaged to a great extent with the SEC, but the SEC did not take any position on this announcement. I think as a dev team, you know, you really want to be careful. We strongly support engagement with the applicable regulator where it is relevant and productive, but be very, very cautious about when and how and who you approach, because you can find yourself in a situation, as this particular project did. Really caught sort of with their pants down, making an announcement three years later, by the way. Yeah, three years later, making an announcement with no support from the regulator.
00:25:19.412 - 00:25:21.584, Speaker B: And that's really concerning. Elena.
00:25:22.864 - 00:25:36.384, Speaker A: Thank you all. I think we're just about out of time. I just want to thank all the panelists. I think it's been a really insightful conversation, notwithstanding the short time limit. So I really appreciate all you being here and thank you everyone.
