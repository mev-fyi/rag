00:00:04.360 - 00:00:18.718, Speaker A: Good morning. Welcome. Breakpoint day two. Who had a good time yesterday? Yeah. And you guys are here bright and early. Thank you for being here. If you don't know where you are, you're back at Pateo de Gallet.
00:00:18.718 - 00:00:46.194, Speaker A: This is the laboratory for deep dives workshops. Dev, focus time. I see a couple people already with the, the silent disco noise canceling headphones which allow you to focus on the content up here on stage with all that's going on out here in the crowd. So thank you. If you need to pick those up, they're at the front. Borrow them for the day, return them on your way out. Once again, just like yesterday, we're going to feed you.
00:00:46.194 - 00:01:13.018, Speaker A: So there's food all over the venue. Breakfast, lunch, enjoy. Bathrooms over on this side, we've got an incredible slate of content for today. Some really wonderful workshops. If you were here yesterday, it was impressive. The lineup of speakers, panels, I learned a tremendous amount, and I'm not a dev, but by the time this three day period is over, maybe that will change. Watch out, colleagues.
00:01:13.018 - 00:01:33.764, Speaker A: I'm coming for you. All right, so our first panel of the day. It's not a panel, actually. Our first workshop of the day is Niko from Elusive, who is going to take us through how to build your own ZK app on Solana in minutes. So get excited, get ready and welcome Nico from Elusive.
