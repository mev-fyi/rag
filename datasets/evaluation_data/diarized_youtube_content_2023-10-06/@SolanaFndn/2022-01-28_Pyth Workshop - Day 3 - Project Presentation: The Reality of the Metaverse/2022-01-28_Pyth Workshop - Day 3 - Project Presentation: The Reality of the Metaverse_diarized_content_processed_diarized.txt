00:00:06.320 - 00:00:11.350, Speaker A: We've got an awesome panel. I'll let everyone introduce themselves and what they're working on.
00:00:11.502 - 00:00:12.558, Speaker B: Bartosz, you can start.
00:00:12.646 - 00:00:29.014, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I already introduced myself before. So, Bartosz from Solana. If Bartosz is too hard to say, you can just call me B. Yeah. And I guess now we'll talk about NFP. So Jordan told me to wear sunglasses.
00:00:29.434 - 00:00:30.218, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:30.386 - 00:00:31.174, Speaker D: Yep.
00:00:32.074 - 00:00:43.934, Speaker E: I'm Jordan, also from Solana Labs. We do a lot of stuff with NFTs. Right now I'm working on a new gaming protocol called Raindrops with Barkash over here.
00:00:44.954 - 00:00:56.704, Speaker D: Hey guys, I'm Ervin from Opennet Technologies. Prior to that, I was doing a PhD in immersive telepresence and been around the space probably since 2012 in bitcoin, also working on Ethereum and now on Solana.
00:00:57.244 - 00:00:57.972, Speaker B: Yep.
00:00:58.108 - 00:00:58.700, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:00:58.812 - 00:00:59.504, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:00:59.804 - 00:01:19.184, Speaker A: So I guess metaverse is kind of those terms that's always in flux. Kind of depends on who's saying it and what they think it means. So maybe you can let us know, what does metaverse mean for you or to you, or define it? What does it consist of?
00:01:20.504 - 00:01:20.888, Speaker B: Sure.
00:01:20.936 - 00:01:27.644, Speaker C: So for me, I think it's just universal way of representing ownership in digital world.
00:01:30.544 - 00:02:14.882, Speaker E: Yeah, I somewhat agree with that. I guess for me, when I imagine the metaverse, I think of ready player one, the book, it really kind of encapsulated actually what we're trying to do with our protocol. Like sort of this being able to define objects in a universal way that anyone can create clients around. So like you can have an immersive, like people have this stuff that they own, like these apes, these, these SMBs, whatever, they even have apartments now they own. Being able to interact with those in any way someone can imagine and then have it be shareable with other people. That's sort of like this next level of reality that is now enabled by like, you know, having computers in your contact lenses and on your phone, everything. See this extra layer, that's where it's.
00:02:14.898 - 00:02:17.026, Speaker B: Going to be, but then the API.
00:02:17.090 - 00:02:18.938, Speaker C: On top of it, so people can easily integrate.
00:02:18.986 - 00:02:19.170, Speaker D: Right.
00:02:19.202 - 00:02:37.414, Speaker C: So we had like digital worlds in games for a long time, but it was somewhat hard to integrate with them. And what blockchain enables is really this easy universal access for verification of what happened and who owns what.
00:02:39.654 - 00:03:30.044, Speaker D: Yeah, I think to follow up on what Bartosz mentioned, because there's always been. Virtual reality has been there since 1980s and similar with cryptocurrencies, they've been out there quite long. I think what we have currently is a different approach to, for example, building decentralized cryptocurrencies and also doing provenance and virtual assets. But I think for us, and us, I mean, open dive, I think the notion of the metaverse, or achieving the metaverse, is the next step towards developing some diver physical systems. And so I could provide a bit of a longer explanation than that, is that if you look at the current trends in technology or emerging technologies, 5g is kind of like a huge thing, but not many people know that's been around for quite a few years. It's been research, actually, currently, the research is on seven g. And so 5g, in connection with IoT Internet of things.
00:03:30.044 - 00:04:24.006, Speaker D: It talks about having interconnected worlds, right? Not only physical, but virtual. And so that is currently happening. And we look at other trends. For example, what's coming in next, I say probably within the decade, is part of our research, which was, you know, immersive humanoid telepresence robots. So this actually, for example, means that you'll be able to go or visit Chicago while you're in Miami through a physical avatar, right? You kind of see, hear, and feel from the remote environment. And so when you look at that, these concepts in terms of the metaverse, well, for us, it means that now we have the introduction of humanity into these concepts, but not only in the virtual space, but also the physical space. So our vision of the metaverse is that you're going to be able to kind of transport yourself from being in this kind of, quote unquote, immersive virtual worlds, but also to the physical world and vice versa, where your identity is translatable or transformable.
00:04:24.006 - 00:04:43.518, Speaker D: So this is when we talk about, for example, virtual representations of wearables. So I might be wearing this kind of shirt, are these glasses, and the quote unquote virtual world, but also my physical avatar could perhaps also wear it. And we have provenance and also traceability in terms of ownership. And so that is really like images, you know, how we feel about the metaverse. In a way.
00:04:43.566 - 00:04:46.114, Speaker B: It could be very cool.
00:04:46.454 - 00:05:08.634, Speaker A: So what do you say to people that say, you know, they're not very well educated on nfts? They say they're just jpegs. Like, what's one NFT project that you can introduce someone like that, too, that will kind of teach them what the use cases of nfts are and why people have gotten pretty excited over it.
00:05:11.174 - 00:05:59.586, Speaker C: So in the digital space, at least on Solana, I really like portals. I think they are fairly straightforward to explain to people from the things that are not necessarily built. What Bill mentioned, I guess during my last talk. Having your credentials as nfts is interesting. Having badges, something that correlates to your activities in real world and shows them that you can prove the ownership. Like the images are whatever people are buying, displaying them, maybe show them that, hey, I own this on Twitter, but I think the use cases are much wider. And going outside of the just jpegs, it's easier to explain it to people that didn't necessarily interacted with it or are more skeptical about what's out there.
00:05:59.586 - 00:06:09.774, Speaker C: What's interesting about portals, it allows you to build your own space, so you participate in the act of creation and then prove the ownership of what you built.
00:06:12.754 - 00:06:49.716, Speaker E: Well, I think something, it really hasn't been fully explored on Solana yet, but I think it's coming soon. Right now, anyone can make an NFT and the creator verifies that NFT, and that's sort of the provenance port. But being able to describe different types of licenses and having a clean API for doing them, like right now, if you want to say, use a clip in your YouTube channel. The system not only is controlled by YouTube, it's kind of hard to use. You sometimes have to interact with people. It would be great if the licensing itself were actually on the blockchain. And I think that is in the near future.
00:06:49.716 - 00:07:25.220, Speaker E: So you say, yeah, I made this image and you can right click and save it. But that actually is illegal in most countries to use that image for money. But wouldn't it be great if I could take that image, I could make a clone of it, another NFT, and then also buy licensing rights to, say, exhibit it at some art show, right? Like you can have the licensing baked in and the payment system baked in. Like royalties just have happen automatically. You don't have to worry about it. You just, you know, if you want to use a clip from some movie, it's just as easy as like drag and drop and all the fees just flow automatically. And so that is a perfect use case for nfTs.
00:07:25.220 - 00:07:32.824, Speaker E: When you add in licensing, it actually makes the current intellectual property systems much more robust, clean and efficient.
00:07:33.644 - 00:07:34.460, Speaker B: Nice.
00:07:34.652 - 00:08:15.948, Speaker D: Yeah, I think so. Mic is off. All right, there you go. Yeah, magic. So, yeah, 100%, I think so. The use case that we use, you know, like we were discussing with Sean, my co founder, Finos, whoever team has been around licensing, right? Because in particular, though, I think we're excited about licenses as NFTs for gaming. And so I think I was able to get through a few people, like, in terms of like how NFT works or why were the value? And we discussed this because, you know, a lot of times, you know, when you go to, we look at like, you know, probably a decade ago, you know, you used to go to kind of like GameStop and buy a game, right, actual CD, and you go ahead and play it.
00:08:15.948 - 00:08:18.344, Speaker D: If you got bored after a week, what do you do?
00:08:18.644 - 00:08:19.348, Speaker B: Sell it.
00:08:19.436 - 00:09:10.990, Speaker D: Exactly. Or you go ahead and trade it with your friends or swap it, right? But what is happening in this decade right now is that you have something like steam. And so what can you do with steam? Well, you go ahead and buy a game and you download it. What if you get bored after like a week or two weeks, right? What can you do with it? You can't return it. You can't trade it. You can't sell it, right? And essentially, like, the whole notion of being able to perhaps or something, being able to put game licenses as nfts kind of empowers the users to kind of trade and interact with other users, right? But this kind of breaks the model of the steams of the world. And so people tell me, well, well, what if steam kind of allows you to kind of do this trading? Well, then how much of a cut are they going to get from this, right? And who can you trade this with? What can they monitor? And so they kind of get to an understanding, too.
00:09:10.990 - 00:09:45.314, Speaker D: Like, you know, there's a bit of a centralization. And, you know, perhaps we should go back to the old blockbuster model. I never actually went to blockbuster, but, you know, back in the days, you could go on blockbuster and rent games. And so then, you know, you think about it now, we have another model that we could apply now presently, where perhaps you have rentals and so subscriptions that could be sold as nfts and so on. So I think that that's how we got through to a few people kind of understanding how nfts could be used to kind of create peer to peer markets and also improve secondary markets and accessibility to games.
00:09:46.814 - 00:10:35.526, Speaker E: One thing that has been remarkable that we've seen is when we were building the original protocol, we were sort of discussing how to enforce royalties on chain, right? Like, one answer would actually be to basically deploy our own token program, but then none of the wallets of the world would be able to interact with our app unless they built sort of special code just for interacting with nfts. But then we could enforce royalties. We decided not to do that. We decided to just put the royalties on chain and let people who were trading nfts or building marketplaces, just choose whether or not to actually enforce those royalties. And surprisingly, the social experiment actually works out. The companies that are in the business of providing good user experiences to people to draw in trading volume want to enforce the royalties because they have. They're incentivized to provide the creators of those nfts.
00:10:35.526 - 00:11:03.890, Speaker E: Like, they want those creators to come back and keep doing stuff. And so the system has enforced itself. But also, you won't often see NFTs charging more than 10% royalties. Like, there's this sort of natural push and pull. If someone sets an NFT to 100%, like someone did recently, people just find ways to trade it, sort of like illegally. It's sort of like there's an upper and lower bound on royalties, and it's completely enforced by just people being people. There's no laws or anything.
00:11:04.082 - 00:11:28.650, Speaker D: It's really interesting, I think, you know, like, so people always ask me, you know, okay, so what's the difference between NFTs and Ethereum and Solana? Right? And so one of the key things you mentioned is, though, that there's. There's already a social consensus of what needs to happen when you trade in a thesis or creator marketplace, right. Is like, almost social enforceability, whereas on the EVM side, that's not really there. And the way to kind of, like, use royalties is very obtuse.
00:11:28.802 - 00:11:29.090, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:29.122 - 00:11:41.210, Speaker D: It's like, only if you want, or you think your users could perhaps use royalties, then you could call this other contract. Whereas, you know, like, on Solana's side, it's always been part of the standard. Right, since the beginning.
00:11:41.362 - 00:11:42.094, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:43.634 - 00:11:57.014, Speaker E: That ignores royalties today. Even the little p two p protocols that are now spouting up where you can, like, offer to trade a basket of NFTs and coins or some other basket of NFTs and coins, they do royalties. It really works.
00:11:57.594 - 00:12:09.214, Speaker A: So are there any plans to, like, I assume when you guys first launched that you were like, if the experiment works, great. If it doesn't, we have a plan to enforce royalties. Is there still a plan to enforce royalties?
00:12:10.354 - 00:12:11.066, Speaker E: I don't think so.
00:12:11.090 - 00:12:38.626, Speaker C: I don't think anyone is going through a model where the smart contract enforces it, because the primary reason for not doing it was not. It was, like, hard or technically difficult. It's actually probably straightforward. But there are always ways around anything that's on the blockchain, like the extreme use cases. I will just give you my wallet. I will give you the ledger with the pen, and you have it, and.
00:12:38.650 - 00:12:42.570, Speaker B: We trade it off chain, and there's.
00:12:42.602 - 00:12:43.934, Speaker C: No way to prevent that.
00:12:45.114 - 00:12:57.064, Speaker E: Yeah, with this world, you kind of have to approach it through the sense of people are only going to do something if it has a positive expense value for them. But you can't punish them into doing something. You have to reward them for doing something.
00:12:58.204 - 00:13:04.556, Speaker D: Systems like, for example, in the case of robots producing data, like why they want to pay royalties or why should they pay royalties for that?
00:13:04.580 - 00:13:05.144, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:05.444 - 00:13:07.584, Speaker D: That could be one use case where you don't need royalties.
00:13:08.444 - 00:13:37.304, Speaker A: I think this like, segues nicely to communities, like how communities are built in the metaverse or with these NFT protocols or projects. I guess they are the ones who are enforcing it, because if the creators or people start doing this stuff, you're just going to have less supply. So how do you guys view community building in that space? And how is it different from Defi and maybe the rest of the crypto different types of chains?
00:13:38.204 - 00:14:16.684, Speaker C: So I guess there's two different questions in terms of how the communities are different. I think they are more engaged. Whenever you have the multiple tokens in my wallet, I don't really get attached to them. The fact that I have, I don't know, ten mango tokens or hundred pip tokens doesn't mean anything to me. I think of them as just money that you can spend. But when you have an NFT, sometimes you get attached to them, like this portal thing or rocks or whatever. I feel associated with them one way or another.
00:14:16.684 - 00:14:54.462, Speaker C: The same way people get attached with the characters in games that they play, even if they are not nfTs. And ultimately, this is how communities are formed, either in games or around tv shows, people get associated with characters or the Persona that they are projecting somewhere else. And the tokens are not giving you that, and Defi protocols are not giving you that either. And I think the way they are built stems from that fact that they are different. So you need to show people that there is a story and why they.
00:14:54.478 - 00:14:58.622, Speaker D: Should care where in defi you want.
00:14:58.638 - 00:15:03.920, Speaker C: To show them that they will make money. Very, very different aspect of life.
00:15:04.102 - 00:15:28.224, Speaker E: And this goes into the whole right click save controversy. Humans like to collect things, and also humans like to form groups, and they love to exclude from groups. So if you just right click and save a JPEG, all the people that actually decided to really own that JPEG, they're not going to let you into their group. That's what grape is. It's an exclusionary tool to keep people out of discords that don't actually have the given attitude.
00:15:28.644 - 00:15:31.928, Speaker C: Yeah, just like the rocks in the polynesian island.
00:15:32.016 - 00:15:32.684, Speaker E: Yes.
00:15:33.064 - 00:15:37.176, Speaker C: If you don't put the marks on the rock, you don't own anything.
00:15:37.280 - 00:15:37.800, Speaker D: Yes.
00:15:37.912 - 00:15:38.176, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:38.200 - 00:15:51.564, Speaker E: So the ownership does matter. Humans, for some reason, we just like collecting things. We like knowing that we're the only ones that have it. We're part of the special group that has it. It's like a, it's a feeling as old as humanity itself. It's just nfts are a new way of expressing it.
00:15:53.544 - 00:15:53.856, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:53.880 - 00:16:00.068, Speaker D: I think there's socioeconomic culture factor to just nfts.
00:16:00.236 - 00:16:00.588, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:00.636 - 00:16:59.918, Speaker D: And I first got a gist of this back in around 2016, 2017, where the rare PayPal kicked off. So for those of you who know rare purpose were like, quote unquote, the first nfts around the bitcoin blockchain. Then they got moved to Ethereum overall, right? And what happened was that people were making these rare paypays and then they were trading them and using them without making any money, right. They were just doing it off chain. And then all of a sudden, someone started selling like, a rare PayPal on eBay, and it was worth a few hundred dollars. Right. But then you started to see how, well, I started to see and people discuss it afterwards, that there is a bit of, like, communities being formed around, you know, how people that, like, appreciated that the actual digital asset grew in value, and then, like, communities that just enjoyed the art, they thought it was, it was quirky and funny, right? And so those are two, like, a few things that happen within this, quote unquote, like collections, right? The NFT collections, the generic collections.
00:16:59.918 - 00:17:40.844, Speaker D: And I think, you know, the one of the ones that did quite well and everyone knows is like board apes, because people were able to relate to the actual apes. Like, personally, I minted a few and I minted the one with the VR goggles. That's the one I wanted. I collected almost all of them at the beginning, right? And my friend, she just wanted to collect the only eye patch because it's thing for like, he has punks and pirates and stuff like that, right? And that's who he associated himself with. But then later when you look at like, the Bordeaux community, for example, it's like a whole bunch of people now, let's say they have like a half a million dollar, you know, quote unquote digital asset. Like, that's a micro community within the macro community that formed. And essentially being able to do that well is, you know, means of success to your project, in essence.
00:17:42.184 - 00:17:43.164, Speaker B: Very cool.
00:17:46.724 - 00:18:06.944, Speaker A: What do you guys think of, like, the gaming side and then the defi side that comes into all the stuff that's being created right now. Nfts are certainly a part of it, but I think they're only a piece. There is a monetization or making money aspect to this side of the industry.
00:18:07.644 - 00:18:16.566, Speaker C: Sometimes I guess I don't think all the experiences, all the games need to be monetized. I mean, sometimes I just want to play the game and don't worry about.
00:18:16.590 - 00:18:18.446, Speaker B: The money and just enjoy it.
00:18:18.510 - 00:18:34.114, Speaker C: Yeah, and maybe if I can pull my character from other games, that's one use case that I would be happy with. Let's say I played some character ten years ago and I liked it and I just want to use it across the game. That's good enough for me.
00:18:35.484 - 00:18:48.224, Speaker E: Actually, if I know a game is played or earned, I probably won't play it because I know that it will feel like work eventually. That grind feeling is just not like, yeah, the games that him and I have played together, they're not really much of a grind.
00:18:48.604 - 00:18:49.316, Speaker C: They are.
00:18:49.420 - 00:18:51.316, Speaker E: Well, they are, but it's intellectual.
00:18:51.380 - 00:18:53.156, Speaker C: I don't know, takes like 40 hours.
00:18:53.260 - 00:18:55.132, Speaker E: Yeah, but it's a beautiful 40 hours.
00:18:55.308 - 00:18:58.284, Speaker D: Maybe halo shoe be played earn Jordan.
00:18:58.364 - 00:19:06.956, Speaker E: Yeah, but yeah, I do think play to earn will be a major component. Like, I think there's a place for that. And I think there actually be games that just have sort of two sides to it.
00:19:06.980 - 00:19:07.140, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:07.172 - 00:19:39.522, Speaker E: Like, I mean, World of Warcraft is sort of an early example of that. There was a whole group, there was like a whole subculture of people in World of Warcraft that that's their job. They make money off of it. They produce items and goods that other people that are playing it recreationally just trade fiat for to get access to. And I do think that'll sort of probably be what the future of games looks like. There are only people that work in the game and people that play the game. I think the age where the things are combined, I don't know that that will last, but we'll see.
00:19:39.522 - 00:19:56.464, Speaker E: I do think it's all linked. The thing that is surprising to me is that people are now coming up with ways to collateralize sops. How do you price that accurately? How do you keep track of the floor price? Make sure that it gets revoked at the right time? That is a very interesting thing to see.
00:19:56.764 - 00:19:59.508, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe that's all you have on it.
00:19:59.516 - 00:20:03.384, Speaker D: I think it's interesting. It's interesting, but it's an unsolved problem. I think collateralization.
00:20:04.164 - 00:20:09.572, Speaker E: Yeah, I don't think it's been done well at scale. Yet, but it'll be interesting to see what it does happen.
00:20:09.708 - 00:20:14.212, Speaker D: Stay away from the auction. Model is broken. That's what everyone's using for NFT collaterals.
00:20:14.268 - 00:20:15.732, Speaker B: But yeah, I think, you know, picking.
00:20:15.748 - 00:21:03.454, Speaker D: Up what Jordan said, like, right, for gaming, you know, wow is one of them. Runescape was a huge one. I know a lot of friends that who are making money by selling GP. Speculation on the value of digital assets within games has always been there. The whole notion of actually being able to reward someone for is actually quite interesting because, for example, even when you look at new world, if you guys are familiar with Amazon's game, there are a ton of bots there speculating on the actual currency itself. But if you look at what happened a few months ago, there was this whole duplicate attack. It wasn't an attack, but essentially every time you went across a different server, the amount of currency you had doubled in price.
00:21:03.454 - 00:22:07.630, Speaker D: If you look at the metrics people started assessing is that the bots are left because now there's hyperinflation in the game. If it ever reaches outside where people want to pay for this virtual gold or virtual currency, you're not going to make any money. I think overall, you know, like in our case, like fundamentally, like at least with an open dive, when I think about, you know, play to earn and what it's supposed to be, I think overall it's supposed to transform labor structures no matter what, right? Because the notion of being able to earn or make a living by playing a game is revolutionary, right? When you look at, for example, people in emerging economies and how much they can make a day or in a week versus how much they could perhaps, you know, make within a game, it changes people's lives, right? It's a way, for example, for them to pay for college, pay for housing, et cetera. And, you know, it's similar to what already happens currently. For example, in China, if you guys go on Taobao, you see someone available twenty four seven to answer questions. There's literally people there like sitting on a computer waiting for someone to ask a question about a product and they're getting paid maybe like $5, you know, a day or something like that. And so that's what I mean by transforming labor structures.
00:22:07.630 - 00:22:40.040, Speaker D: But yeah, you know, like, as Jordan Bartosz said is, you know, there's still a lot of room to grow because, you know, like games should be fun, right? Games shouldn't be just about yield farming. That's what currently is like most, quote unquote, play do earn games that you see, out there is just yield farming with an additional step or uis, you can encrypt the Twitter, right? I mean, I don't want to bash on these games, but literally is what it is, right? And so then the question is, who is the demographic they're targeting these game ads? Is it, you know, my nephew who is like eight years old, or my cousin who's 13? I don't think so.
00:22:40.072 - 00:22:40.288, Speaker B: Right?
00:22:40.336 - 00:23:24.126, Speaker D: They're not going to play this game like click farm, swap, earn yields, etcetera. So there's a lot of room to go. But the other thing, and last thing I would say that is actually quite complicated to introduce cryptocurrencies into games. When you look at mmorpgs, think about having a multi currency system, right? And the multi currency system is not only impacted by internal forces within the game, like Amazon messing up their servers, but external forces, meaning that, you know, like if you guys play Apex Legends, they have apex coin and four other currencies. One of them is an event coin. This event coin is only supposed to be used, for example, for events, okay, no matter what. And they use it to trade scans for particular events only.
00:23:24.126 - 00:23:55.580, Speaker D: Now the question is, what happens is if event coin becomes a cryptocurrency. So now maybe one event coin you could use to, you know, trade a scam. But outside of the game, this event coin is worth $100. You think someone's going to now use the event coin to buy that skin? Probably not, right? They're going to speculate, even if you're like a young person playing a game, they're not going to sell this event coin. So there's a lot of things to really think at the economical level. So it's a complex problem overall. But I think currently play to earn games have a bit of a long way to go.
00:23:55.580 - 00:23:59.568, Speaker D: And we're thinking about these problems when we design the economics for our game. Open era.
00:23:59.676 - 00:24:01.644, Speaker B: Overall, awesome.
00:24:02.384 - 00:24:17.924, Speaker A: I guess let's end it on. If you wanted to give some steps, some basic steps for the audience to get more involved in the metaverse in some way, sure, give them a recommendation.
00:24:19.024 - 00:25:11.494, Speaker C: If you didn't do anything on Solana, go in Sar Phantom Wallet and go to Magic Eden or fractal and try to buy something, even if it's really cheap for like a $3, $5 experience. The end to end workflow of actually buying something if you feel adventures go meant something. So that's like primary versus secondary market. That's from the user perspective, and you should do it regardless, even if you're an engineer, you should think like a user. And if you are an engineer, you should start building something on top of that. So the standard on Solana is fairly extensible through program drive addresses. Think how we can extend the protocol, submit pull requests back to Metaplex so we can all bolt together.
00:25:13.914 - 00:25:41.774, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean all of that, definitely. Once you've done all of that, I would really like to see a protocol on top of metaplex that deals with treating licensing as a kind of token so that it can be bought and sold. There can be swap pools, there can be price discovery for licensing of these objects. So I think it's a wide open field. So once you learn how the metaflex underlying protocol works, no one's really fixed that problem yet. Be nice to see.
00:25:42.754 - 00:26:23.904, Speaker D: I think it's very easy. Just, you know, go in the App Store, download Facebook and Instagram, and then you're in the metaverse. No, I think. Okay, so, okay, so presently I would say look at the Metaplex like website in the dock. It's very interesting, you know, talk a bit about interoperability of like, like assets. And so if you try to get a bit technical, you understand, you know, as like where, where things like metaverse standard come into play. And you know, what the metaverse awaits because, you know, interoperability between digital assets and also being able to have like open, accessible systems that have an underlying trustless source of truth will become valuable in the near future.
00:26:23.904 - 00:26:44.134, Speaker D: And not just for the metaverse or this kind of virtual concept. People think, but everything we do, because things like Internet of things are already coming, concepts related to data privacy will be more and more get more focus here in the states and across the world. And so, yeah, I think maybe just look at the repo and of course download phantom and also get minting perhaps.
00:26:44.514 - 00:26:47.274, Speaker B: Nice. Thank you guys. Yeah, thank you.
