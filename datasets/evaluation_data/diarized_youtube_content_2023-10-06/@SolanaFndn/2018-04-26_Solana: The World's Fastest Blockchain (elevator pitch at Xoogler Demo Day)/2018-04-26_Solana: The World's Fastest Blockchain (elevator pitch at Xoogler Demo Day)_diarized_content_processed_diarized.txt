00:00:05.560 - 00:00:29.152, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Anatoly, founder and CEO of Solana, the world's fastest blockchain. If you want to build a decentralized Uber or Lyft on top of unscalable Ethereum, you're screwed, full stop. That was Vitalik Burton talking about his creation, Ethereum. The max. Transactions per second for bitcoin or ethereum are around ten transactions per second in the entire world right now. Nasdaq can handle over 500,000 messages per second.
00:00:29.152 - 00:01:03.702, Speaker A: Solana can actually handle 700,000 transactions per second in a one gigabit network on commodity hardware. So why can we do this? Because me and my co founders work at Qualcomm, building the world's biggest wireless network in the world. You guys are all holding cell phones right now. There's over a billion of these devices in the world right now running our code. What's their secret sauce? We are encoding passage of time as data. So, long story short, data is time. If you have time, you can scale distributed systems.
00:01:03.702 - 00:01:40.898, Speaker A: Google uses this in their two time databases and spanner, and that's our magic. If you want to reach out to me about the technical details, please do so. But we only have three minutes. So why is this important? Because we can decentralize all things. We can have a Google advertisement network, we can have a Nasdaq exchange, we can have a visa on top of our permissionless public ledger. This is the dream of blockchain and our partners right now, global id and radar relay are building these technologies. We're working with them to make sure that they work when we launch.
00:01:40.898 - 00:02:26.478, Speaker A: So if you guys are interested in disrupting Google or Facebook or Nasdaq, please keep talking. So we are Solana, world's fastest blockchain. Thank you. Not only the world's fastest network, but also the fastest presentation. So, rust and Kunga, any other questions? This time I will allow very specific questions given the nature of the startup. Yes. Is this live on a testnet yet? We haven't testnet out, it's not live.
00:02:26.478 - 00:02:57.800, Speaker A: But you can go to our GitHub, download the code, build it, run it, play around with it. Yes. No comment. How do you plan to price it? There is a coin that facilitates the resources on this permissionless network. So it's similar to Ethereum. What you would be investing in if you were would be the similar to Ethereum. So something that would look like a token when it's actually live.
00:02:57.800 - 00:03:43.594, Speaker A: But how that happens in the United States? It's an open question. We are using proof of stake because we can do sub second finality. So we can have actually do something that almost looks like a high frequency trading platform on a permissionless network. All right, real quick, we can support a very large number of nodes. So the finality scales with the log of the size of the network. So millions of nodes similar to Bittorrent. Short answer.
00:03:43.594 - 00:04:02.898, Speaker A: Please come talk to me about the technical details. I'd love to deep dive. Quick comment. Yes, they have a very vibrant telegram community. It's pretty remarkable. So when you talk to him in the mixer, make sure you ask him about joining them. Thank you.
00:04:02.898 - 00:04:11.514, Speaker A: Yeah, join our telegram. Thank you so much. Next up is up.
