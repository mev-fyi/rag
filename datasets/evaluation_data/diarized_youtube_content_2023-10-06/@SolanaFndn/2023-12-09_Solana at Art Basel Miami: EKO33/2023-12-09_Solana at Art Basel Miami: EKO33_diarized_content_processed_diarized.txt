00:00:00.880 - 00:00:45.038, Speaker A: I'm Jean Jacques Duclos, aka Eco 33. I'm a generative and algorithmic artist. I explore the relationships between humans and machines and cognitive biases here at Art Basel, when the public arrives in my studio, they can see my first collection on Solana, minted in 2021, called Epox. And then just on the right, they can see, for the first time in the US being exhibited, my latest series called Terra Incognita. Then they have the opportunity to play with a theremin, which I built, that people can interact with and change the work in front of them. As far as I know, this is one of the very first time where it's used to interact with visual creation. The way it works is you approach.
00:00:45.038 - 00:01:41.414, Speaker A: I'm going to calibrate the device so it reacts with the magnetism of your body, and then you're going to influence the colors of the work or some other parameters that I built into my code. Solana collectors have been extremely supportive since the very beginning. Open minded. They are very inclusive in their approach when it comes to art, but also when it comes to the technology, which is quite rare, I think today. I mean, the performances of Solana have been absolutely stunning. It's environmentally friendly, and I think it really has a role to play. In the future, I would like people to discover a little bit more about myself and how I work, like inviting them in my studio and showing them that I paint with code and pixels, and that behind the software, there's a human being, which is super happy to share the process and the experience with everyone.
