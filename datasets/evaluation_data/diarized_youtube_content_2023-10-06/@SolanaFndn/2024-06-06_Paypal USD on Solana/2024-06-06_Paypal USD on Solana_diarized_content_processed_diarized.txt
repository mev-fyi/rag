00:00:02.480 - 00:00:16.910, Speaker B: We're excited to announce that PayPal USD is now available on the Solana blockchain, making PayPal stablecoin faster and cheaper to use. Having PYUSD available on Solana furthers our mission of enabling a digital currency with a stable value, designed for commerce and payments.
00:00:17.022 - 00:00:35.864, Speaker A: PayPal USD is issued by Paxos Trust Company, which is a fully chartered, limited purpose trust company. There are many reasons for choosing Solana for expansion of PYUSD, especially related to the unique features that are enabled via token extension. The permanent delegate function was critical for regulatory purposes and required for compliance.
00:00:35.984 - 00:01:04.652, Speaker C: So PayPal for them, they wanted to prioritize a credibly decentralized blockchain, a blockchain that is performant in nature and a blockchain that had a thriving community of developers. The hope for the future is that PayPal leads the way to show financial institutions that there is a better and faster and more efficient way to move money. And with a blockchain like Solana, you can move value, whether it's $0.10 or $10 million instantly with instant finality. And you can do this at scale.
00:01:04.748 - 00:01:16.276, Speaker A: The vision for PyUSD was always to enable and leverage it for payments use cases, and a large part of enabling it for payments use cases is to make it available in a high throughput, low cost blockchain.
00:01:16.380 - 00:01:36.804, Speaker B: We feel that the partnership that we have with Paxos and the adoption of the Solana blockchain for PyUsD really starts to move us from the awareness to the utility phase where developers and ecosystem participants can really use PYUSD for a whole new set of applications. We're thrilled to celebrate this launch on Solana with the rest of the crypto ecosystem ambiance.
