00:00:06.400 - 00:00:30.967, Speaker A: Good morning. Good morning. I'm Michael, I'm from Marinade. And today I'm extremely excited to announce Marinade V2, which is the new and improved version of Marinade. So we got a long way going. Marinade has been around since 2021 when it launched the first liquid stage solution on Solana. Completely bootstrapped, with no VC money.
00:00:30.967 - 00:01:16.105, Speaker A: And today we're taking those three years of learnings and we're baking in this new marinade to shake up the staking industry once again. But why marinade V2? To solve problems. So first, the number one reason why people don't want to use liquid staking solutions like Amsolam is still the smart contract risk. They don't want to transfer the SALT to a smart contract and worry about potential risk. And that's why if you combine all LSTs together, you get this about 6, 7% adoption compared to total stake market cap on Solana. Next, validators. If you're staking to a validator, they go offline or change commission.
00:01:16.105 - 00:01:51.991, Speaker A: This is going to affect your staking rewards. In other words, your staking rewards as of now are not protected. This big exchange validator went offline for five hours in that one epoch. For those five hours, their stakers lost more than 700 SOL for that time. And finally, hidden commissions. So validators would earn for multiple revenue streams ranging from MEP tips, inflation block rewards. So it's very hard to tell and quite often they make more rewards than stakers realize.
00:01:51.991 - 00:02:36.293, Speaker A: Which is why some big stall holders would end up running their own private nodes to capture it all. Or you have hundreds of validators running at 0% commission because it makes sense for them it's still profitable. There are other revenue streams. So combining it all together, how does V2 solve that? So starting with smart contract risk marinade V2 introduces a new product called Marinade Native which is completely non custodial. Here's how it works. So unlike liquid sticking, you don't get to send your soul anywhere. With Marinade Native, you keep control of your soul and you only delegate the stake authority to the marinade delegation strategy.
00:02:36.293 - 00:03:12.757, Speaker A: So this way you don't need to forego, you don't need to send your soul anywhere. You keep it with you and only using the delegation strategy. Next, validators. So let's touch on that Protected staking rewards is this new cool thing that we are introducing. You can think of it like an insurance for your staking rewards. So if you're staking to a validator expecting 8% yield, that validator goes offline for five hours, that yield just drops to 7.2%. So with Marinade's BSR system, any Solana valator to get station from Marinade, they need to set up a bond of saw.
00:03:12.757 - 00:04:05.745, Speaker A: So if they go offline or they change commission, this bond then covers any potential loss of the rewards, making sure that your rewards are 100% protected, meaning 100% uptime. And finally you would be thinking that you get the best staking rate by delegating to 0% commission by later or even running your own. And you'd be right. Until today. Today we're happy to announce the final missing piece of Marinade V2, which is the stake auction marketplace. The way it works is that Marinate puts all the delegated Sol up for an auction to all soldiers and the validators bid each other using all revenue streams, MEV tips, block rewards, inflation rewards, you name it. To get the best yield possible on the market out there.
00:04:05.745 - 00:04:48.636, Speaker A: This allows stakers to tap into the highest rewards possible without them needing to go to stake with 0% commission validators or run their own node. So once again there is no second best right now. Super excited about that. And finally, thanks. Finally I'm happy to announce that Marinade is entering a strategic partnership with Zodia and Copper. So as of now, their customers can be using Marinade V2, this new version right in their custody platforms. Meaning that it's very easy and even more secure for their users to use Marinade V2.
00:04:48.636 - 00:04:56.625, Speaker A: So welcome to Marinade V2, right? The non custodial, protected and highest rewards way to stake your Solana. Thank you for your time.
