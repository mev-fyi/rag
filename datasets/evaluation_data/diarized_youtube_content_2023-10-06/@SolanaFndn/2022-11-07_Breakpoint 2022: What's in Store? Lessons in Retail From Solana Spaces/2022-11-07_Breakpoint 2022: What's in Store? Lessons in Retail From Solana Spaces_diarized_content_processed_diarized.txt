00:00:09.680 - 00:00:50.514, Speaker A: How awesome is that? That's the Solana spaces anthem. Someone just sent it to us on Twitter. It's an amazing song. Thank you so much. Yes. I'm Vibhu. I'm the founder of Solana Spaces.
00:00:50.514 - 00:01:32.796, Speaker A: And you guys are all on our twitter right now. I just took a picture and posted it. So we built the Solana store. Maybe you've heard of it, with amazing partners like FTX, Phantom, Orca, Stepan, and many others. And just to know, this is a very interactive presentation, so you need to keep your phone on, keep your camera on, and throughout, we're going to be giving away products that we make live. What you're going to do is you're going to scan the code, it's going to bring you to a tweet, and you're going to find not that tweet, but the tweet below it, and you're going to like it. Then right after this presentation, I'm going to pick someone randomly and give you one of our things.
00:01:32.796 - 00:01:50.044, Speaker A: So pay attention. Here's the first one. You see this clock? You get 10 seconds to scan it. This is the Solana zip hoodie, one of our favorites. Did you get it? Just testing you. I'll give you two more seconds. Let's go.
00:01:50.044 - 00:02:56.186, Speaker A: So, Solana store. This is our store in New York City. It's really the first of its kind in the world. It's a place to learn, earn, and experience Solana in real life. This is Solana Spaces, New York City. So we launched that three months ago. And then two weeks ago, we launched the world's first crypto embassy.
00:02:56.186 - 00:04:27.550, Speaker A: We call it the Solana Embassy. We put it in Miami, in Wynwood. And though it's similar functionality wise to New York City, we took this to the next level. The Solana embassy is a lounge. It's a community center, it's a nightclub, it's a coffee shop, and it's a store all wrapped in one. I'm going to show you what the embassy looks like in nightclub mode. How awesome is that? People come from all over the world to experience Solana in real life.
00:04:27.550 - 00:05:01.394, Speaker A: We've hosted kids, college students. We just hosted the whole MBa class of NYU stern corporations tours. They come to learn about crypto in real life, learn about web3 in real life. We educate people on Solana, and we help them get set up with Phantom. We teach them about the basics of security and self custody. In Miami, we also have the FTX lounge. This is where people can learn about exchange and all the things that FTX is doing throughout our store, visitors scan QR codes and they complete tutorials right in the Dapp browser in Phantom.
00:05:01.394 - 00:06:04.694, Speaker A: In the process, they learn about everything from Defi with Orca, gaming with Aurora, project, nfts with just ape, and one of one art with form function and a lot more. And so when a customer scans a QR code in the store, really able to form a deep relationship with the customer in their wallet, we can airdrop them things in the future, we can follow up with them and see what they've been doing on chain and how effective our tools were. And as an example, portals, which is a metaverse project on Solana. After you take their tutorial, they drop you a Solana citizen NFT card and it gives you a special room theme inside of their metaverse. It's really, really cool. When customers complete stores, we always give them an NFT and some partners, they offer their own tokens, they give you their own nfts, they give you merch as rewards and all kinds of things. We really think that nfts are a big part of the future of retail, and they create these kind of instantaneous and very sticky loyalty products just out of the box.
00:06:04.694 - 00:06:26.380, Speaker A: But here we also designed a model to reward people for shopping. We call this shop to earn. So if you take enough tutorials in the store, we actually give you ten USDC for free. And you can actually experience that today at our pop up. Just come in, check in, do a tutorial, and we're going to give you $10. Not bad. Are you paying attention? These are the famous Solana shoes.
00:06:26.380 - 00:06:50.494, Speaker A: These are in size eleven. They're almost sold out. These are one of the last few we have. All right. Solana is a lot more than just the reason I fell in love with Solana was because of the culture. And pictured here, you can see the degenerate Ape academy and on these beautiful mural frames. And mural actually rolled out a phantom integration just for us.
00:06:50.494 - 00:07:22.764, Speaker A: Here's just ape. Solana is an enabler of big ideas and Internet culture. These guys make amazing high quality products on par with any of the best fashion brands in the world. We make a lot of products too, from the famous Solana shoes, or maybe infamous, the bowling shoes, to backpacks, prep bags, t shirts and a lot more. We're putting Solana everywhere. Here's a tie dye hoodie. I'm catching off guard.
00:07:22.764 - 00:07:43.864, Speaker A: This one we actually sold out of. I know a lot of people here on the waitlist, but we brought one. We have one special one here. I'm going to talk about the success of our products in a little bit. But of course, Solana Pay is fundamental to the store experience. So if you have USDC in your wallet, you can pay and settle with us in seconds. It's really an amazing experience.
00:07:43.864 - 00:08:44.704, Speaker A: I want to show you Clara trying Solana pay for the first time at the embassy. This is our best selling short, not financial advice. We're launching it in black for the winter. Just two clicks. Two clicks. I mean, it's literally better than a credit card. It's awesome.
00:08:44.704 - 00:09:04.992, Speaker A: So since we launched three months ago, we've only been around for three months. I know, it feels like a long time. It's been a quarter. We've hosted 30,000 people in the store, mostly in New York City, and we've helped people complete 10,000 Solana tutorials. So far. We've done a lot of parties and meetups like the one I showed you. If you ask me, what's the gap? It's because people love merch.
00:09:04.992 - 00:09:30.144, Speaker A: 60% of the people that come into the store, they just want to go and browse the crypto merch. That's why we're so focused on this. Between Miami and New York City, we expect 200,000 people to come into our stores this year, about 70,000 to onboard into Fantom. These are real people. They're taking 10, 20, 30 minutes out of their day to learn about Solana. And these are a lot of folks that probably ignored it over the last few years. Right? We really interrupt their day with this.
00:09:30.144 - 00:09:51.504, Speaker A: And although we accept credit cards too, we've processed a lot of Solana pay volume as well. And people love it. It's really rewarding. We'll probably do half a million dollars in volume just through crypto pay. I think we're maybe one of the only stores in the world that's using this. And they also do our gasless NFT rewards. So it's all through Solanapay scan a code, we give you an NFT.
00:09:51.504 - 00:10:10.904, Speaker A: I think within the next year we're going to give out probably a quarter of a million nfts for free to people. It's kind of crazy. And it's all powered by a point of sale called decaf. All right, we've got to talk about Twitter. Okay. We designed our stores to be magnets for photos and videos. And to be honest, Twitter has been a revelation.
00:10:10.904 - 00:10:40.148, Speaker A: I want to share some stats with you. Just from three months in 1500 square feet locations the size of the stage, we've driven more than 50,000 mentions for Solana. And 2 million people have visited our profile, on our website to find out what we do. And 10 million impressions on Twitter alone. And it's really a viral sensation. It makes a lot of sense, right? People come in, they take photos, they take videos, they look really good, and then they share them and then they get reshared. And not only on Twitter, but on TikTok and Instagram.
00:10:40.148 - 00:11:01.780, Speaker A: It's been really a viral sensation. We're going to reach 50 million people in our first year. We really have fashioned ourselves more than just a store, but also as, like, the consumer marketing arm of Solana that doesn't have. And we really try to do new things every week. On Sundays, we drop these seed phrase puzzles. You can check those out. This is a new idea we launched a few weeks ago called NFT list.
00:11:01.780 - 00:11:30.440, Speaker A: If you scan and you put your sole address in, we send you high quality artwork for free every single week on Wednesdays. And we have lots more experiments brewing. I sold $600 worth of ad slots right in the middle of my presentation. We're completely shameless. Yeah, 60 slots. Not bad, huh? All right, let's move on. Solana shoes.
00:11:30.440 - 00:12:00.748, Speaker A: Size ten is our most popular size. Just gonna annoy Chase. Do not fade the Solana shoes. All right, so what's next? When. That's what everyone asks us over and over and over again. When Lisbon, when London, when San Francisco, when Dubai, when Delhi. And this is something that we've been working on since the beginning of the company.
00:12:00.748 - 00:12:42.088, Speaker A: In fact, this was one of the reasons that we created Solana spaces. And we have your answers today. Bomdia Dow. That's my shirt. Today we're announcing spaces Dao. Spaces Dao is the world's first on chain retail co op, and it's backed by a Colorado LCA. This is more than just any ordinary Dao.
00:12:42.088 - 00:13:22.194, Speaker A: This is a bet that Solana is going to change how retail is done. We've built a lot in the last year. Solana space is a very complex project. It's a coordination and orchestration between hardware design, software design, dapps merch, physical space, and a lot more. And today we're announcing that we've given everything we built to spaces now. Now anyone anywhere can build their own Solana store. And if you join the DAO, you can access everything that we've designed and built to create your own space in your own city.
00:13:22.194 - 00:13:54.194, Speaker A: This is the first open source retailer. How do you join? Another big idea. We invented something called Geo NFTs, so it's very simple. We have an interface. You can carve out the borders of land on a map, and it's a new spec to offer proof of geography products. So a Geo NFT stores the coordinates on chain. They don't overlap.
00:13:54.194 - 00:14:26.850, Speaker A: And you can send these as nFTs to people's wallets. So it's really simple. If you have a Geo NFT, you can redeem it one for one with the exclusive rights to open a Solana store in that region. So NFTs become contracts. This is enforced by the DAO. This is a brand new way to build a franchise on chain. And there's two ways to get them.
00:14:26.850 - 00:14:57.154, Speaker A: One, you can commit to build and you get it for free from the DaO. But for the first time ever, Geo NFTs make location rights composable and tradable. Occasionally, the Dow will actually auction off the rice to key markets like London or Dubai. We don't think it's a stretch to say that the next Wendy's or McDonald's or franchising business might be built on top of Geo NFTs. It offers a lot of power and you can see more. We're going to be posting a Twitter thread right now. You can learn more about how this works.
00:14:57.154 - 00:15:27.770, Speaker A: This is the reversible wag me NGMI bucket hat. I have three of them to give away. You literally flip it around. I know you weren't paying attention for this one. So in addition to gnfts, there's a lot of new ideas. I don't have time to share all of them with you. That kind of power the dial, but we really thought deeply about how do we make you successful and how do we use crypto in interesting ways here.
00:15:27.770 - 00:16:16.916, Speaker A: And so with revenue bounties that are powered by a custom version of Super Team Earn, we offer built in monetization tools for owners. So the DaO strikes partnerships with great brands that offer customer acquisition bounty, say $10 to onboard a customer into FTX, or $1,000 to display an NFT collection. And they can get paid right from the bounties. And with merch at cost, members can become the local hub for cryptomers, not just Solana Merch. And what's amazing about this is that the more members that join the Dao, the larger orders the Dao can place for merch, and the lower the cost get and the more they can drive margins. In fact, this is why co ops exists in the first place, is to do group buying. It's an amazing solution for crypto, even if you're new to building stores? I've been building stores for almost ten years.
00:16:16.916 - 00:16:43.794, Speaker A: My team has been building stores for a long time, all over the globe. We're not going to let you fail. And there's one more thing. If you decide to join in certain regions of the world, the Dao itself, the treasury is going to invest in your build out up to $50,000. So we've really made it easy to build your own Solana space. We want this everywhere. We have signed commitments from teams all over the world to build a Solana space in the region.
00:16:43.794 - 00:17:11.442, Speaker A: And one of the coolest things about running this as an on chain Dao is that it's not just individuals who are building stores, it's actually Solana ecosystem projects. Los Angeles is being built by the cupcake team. Dubai is being built by an NFT community called Kets. Salt Lake City particles, NFT, Mexico City decaf. I think Ardaviv is building the one in Vienna, which is not on the slide. The good news is that these are all launching in 2023. So we're going big time.
00:17:11.442 - 00:17:36.644, Speaker A: We're going to put a Solana embassy in every city and a Solana space in every town in the next ten years. It launches now. You can go to spacesdow.org, comma. You can scan the QR code, follow the new account on Twitter spaces Dao and apply to join. We'd love to hear from you. Wherever you are, we really want you in spacesdao.
00:17:36.644 - 00:17:54.908, Speaker A: This is been a labor of love for a long time. To bring this to you guys. There's one more thing. I can't let you go without telling you what is in the box. I don't know if you guys have seen this post. It went viral. We just posted this nondescript.
00:17:54.908 - 00:18:20.304, Speaker A: It's not vhs tapes. Everybody got it wrong. Nobody got it right. You ready to find out what's in the box? All right. This is the Solana spaces Lego kit. You can literally build your own Solana space. And it's amazing.
00:18:20.304 - 00:18:43.762, Speaker A: It's a full reproduction of the store. It's complete with Raj minifigures, anatoly minifigures, Milo the dog. Let me show you some details. So we made 100 sets of these available. We sold 20 of them sight unseen to people on Twitter. So the way to get this is go to Convento del Beato, visit our pop up reserve one. They're going to go very fast.
00:18:43.762 - 00:18:54.910, Speaker A: They're retailing for $420.69. Very specific number. You can see everything here. There's a mini Solana shoe. There's a mini saga phone. There's some of our merch as t shirts. There's an ambassador.
00:18:54.910 - 00:19:16.394, Speaker A: There's a lot of monkey business, has the NFT gallery. There's a phantom seed phrase. The detail in this is really, really insane. We spent way too much time and money on this, to be very honest with you. And we're giving one away. We brought only a few to the conference. So this is one of the ones that we brought here to give to people.
00:19:16.394 - 00:19:35.736, Speaker A: All right. Awesome. So lastly, we have this amazing store. And in that store, you're going to find the Lego kit. You're going to find a lot of exclusive merch. Honestly, there's more people here than we expected. We didn't make enough.
00:19:35.736 - 00:19:57.710, Speaker A: So go early and buy and get shirts like this bom dia dow shirt I'm wearing today. But there's also partner merch there. There's justape, there's FTX, there's amazing step in sweatshirts. And there's a few surprises as well. If you make the journey, you're definitely going to get hooked up. Thank you so much. It's been an honor to speak to you guys and to be building the Solana and see you at the pop up.
00:19:57.710 - 00:19:58.094, Speaker A: Thank you.
