00:00:03.280 - 00:00:10.326, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. My name is Lucas Brewter, co founder and CEO at Jito Labs, also known as Buffalo on Twitter.
00:00:10.510 - 00:00:14.674, Speaker B: I'm Zano, co founder and CTO Stackfall Doctor on Twitter.
00:00:15.374 - 00:01:02.124, Speaker A: We're here to talk about Jito Stakenet today. It's a novel self sustaining protocol for decentralized liquid staking tokens. We've been spending the last few months building judo soul, contributing to it, and we've learned a lot and also learned some of the shortcomings with current liquid staking tokens on Solana and been spending a lot of time on Jitto Stakenet, and I think you guys will like it a lot. So, yeah, I'll kind of dive into what is Jito Labs. What do we do? We started in mid 2021. We built the systems to enable efficient mev extraction on Solana. Mev stands for maximum extractable value.
00:01:02.124 - 00:01:34.374, Speaker A: It's the value that you can extract as a block producer or a validator on the network by reordering transactions. Solana. There's a lot of mev on Solana, and one byproduct of that is a lot of spam from arbitrages, failed trades. So the effort of that was judo. Solana. It's a mev enabled fork of the Solana valid air client. It's 99% Solana labs code, and then there's some jitocode in there to process transaction bundles.
00:01:34.374 - 00:02:04.206, Speaker A: Bundles are a useful primitive for traders and searchers on Solana. Also, some applications and wallets can use bundles to protect their users. As of today, it's currently running on 192 validators. It's roughly 40% of stake. And with the current Solana price, it's securing around $6 billion of Solana. And we're also contributors to Jito network and Jito Soul. Yeah.
00:02:04.230 - 00:02:34.146, Speaker B: So let's talk about Jito soul. Let's take a step back. What is liquid staking? Even a step a further step back, what is staking? Staking is essentially you lock up an asset and by locking that asset up, you secure the network. The problem with that is you lose capital efficiency. Your assets basically locked up, and you can't use it across defi. You're earning yield, but you're inefficient. So liquid staking tokens solve this.
00:02:34.146 - 00:03:05.694, Speaker B: Jitosol specifically solves this in a unique way. Jito Soul has seen tremendous growth. These numbers are actually, they keep changing on us. So this is about a week old. Jito Soul is at right under 5 million Sol TvL right now, which at today's prices, is around $175 million. The growth is actually 200% over the past month, and approximately 30% of that is used across DeFi, which equates to. To $45 million, roughly.
00:03:07.154 - 00:03:07.530, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:07.562 - 00:03:46.678, Speaker B: So, like I mentioned, all stake pools, they make various trade offs. There's this tradeoff of decentralization and higher yield for users. Jitosol tries to balance that by incentivizing decentralization, such as geographically incentivizing validators, to run the Jito Solana Mev client, and while also maintaining a high yield. The program that it uses is the Solana program library. This was written by Solana program, or Solana core engineers. It went through seven audits by five companies. So it is bulletproof, it is non custodial.
00:03:46.678 - 00:03:55.594, Speaker B: And, yeah, the validator set is very high performant, and it's going to continue to grow from 66, hopefully to 100 soon.
00:03:57.524 - 00:03:57.876, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:57.900 - 00:04:32.900, Speaker B: So here's some numbers. On the left, we have the total amount of Jito soul used across Defi. Today, that number is just north of a million. So roughly $35 to $40 million of GDA Sol is used across Defi. On the right, we're showing all lsts. So really, the point of these graphs is we're seeing the numbers up and to the right, and that's a great thing. We believe that these numbers will continue to go up and to the right, especially considering how small the piece of the pie is right now.
00:04:32.900 - 00:05:05.536, Speaker B: So this total staking market is around $14 billion. There's only 450 million of that in stake pools across all of Solana. So we're early. So, yeah, there's this weird thing. We're saying stake pools are the future of Defi, but staking tokens in their current form are not defi. That's very contradictory. So stake pools are run centrally.
00:05:05.536 - 00:05:11.084, Speaker B: They're centrally operated right now by teams, and this leads to all sorts of issues. Let's dive into that.
00:05:11.384 - 00:05:40.294, Speaker A: We've been developing this thesis for a while that Solana liquidity staking tokens are not DeFi. Sounds kind of weird. Unfortunately, that was confirmed recently with Lido sunsetting their staking product on Solana. For those that don't know Lido, they're currently number one liquid staking protocol on Ethereum, doing really well. They've seen a lot of growth recently. They launched on Solana a few years ago. They were number two liquid staking token on Solana.
00:05:40.294 - 00:06:29.632, Speaker A: They had around $4 million of soul this time last year. And basically in November or in September, there was a post where basically they decided to sunset, the staking product on Solana, the development costs were too high, so it's in the process of sunsetting now. I think on November 17 there's a, the validators will stop operating, so yield will go down. And then in the future, the only way that you can de stake your SD sole will be through the command line. And, you know, we think that this is a big issue. Think that DeFi should operate without these centralized parties, should be censorship resistant, transparent. This isn't unique to Lido.
00:06:29.632 - 00:07:01.624, Speaker A: I think every stake pool on Solana has this issue today. So I think to kind of like dive into this. How do stake pools work on Solana? Like, how does Solana Liquid staking tokens work? So Solana, as Donna mentioned, is delegated proof of stake. You can deposit your soul into a stake account. You stake that stake account to a validator. Stake pools are kind of a layer on top of that. So you can deposit your soul into the stake pool, it will delegate it to a stake account, and that goes on a validator.
00:07:01.624 - 00:07:43.638, Speaker A: And yeah, there's typically an admin with the stake pool, and there's a lot of algorithmic stake pools on Solana. I use algorithmic in a good way, not a bad way, like algorithmic stablecoins and all that. But yeah, you can basically move stake around between validators. Every stake pool has kind of different criteria. Some are like maximally decentralized, some are like one or two or five validators. So it kind of just depends. Typically these admins, they use like Solana rpcs, off chain APIs, you know, there's an off chain database that will store their performance over time.
00:07:43.638 - 00:08:12.094, Speaker A: The admin is running on like a GCP server or something. It's a hot wallet. It can move stake around between validators in the network lite on marinade. Are they custom? They're different programs, but similar idea behind these. And yeah, as I mentioned earlier, like stake pools, they develop custom bots. This is actually like a pretty difficult effort. You know, it takes a lot of time.
00:08:12.094 - 00:08:40.890, Speaker A: You have to have a lot of monitoring for it. If you're not monitoring it all the time and you miss the epoch rollover, then stake pool has a yield dragon. It's really hard to figure out if you have a bad performing validator, do you stake them immediately? Do you kind of like maybe it was just a fluke and you keep them staked. So there's a lot of difficulty in running that. And it's a single server that's running that. Yeah.
00:08:40.922 - 00:09:17.518, Speaker B: So you saw the admin box and Lucas slide right there. So there's this other issue with stake pools. Basically the admin, which is responsible for rebalancing stake across validators, adding validators to the pool, setting the commission fee, things like that. That is a hotkey pair wallet right now, and that lives on some server, and you're relying on that team to have their OpSeC tight and not lose that key pair or have it leaked. So let's dive into an interesting attack that could happen. Let's say that admin key pair gets leaked, something the malicious actor could do. They could move all that stake to their validator.
00:09:17.518 - 00:09:56.614, Speaker B: And now you have a validator. Let's say that stake pool runs 20% to 30% of the network's soul through the pool. Now you have a malicious actor that basically controls 30% of the network. They can do all sorts of things like try to bring the network down, dos the network, so not cool things. Another issue is you're really relying that the team is not in a unfavorable crypto jurisdiction. So you can imagine the team is in a country that doesn't like crypto too much. Well, now that country can basically force their hand and say, hey, let's censor these types of validators.
00:09:56.614 - 00:10:17.354, Speaker B: Let's not allow these sorts of transactions to come through those validators. And that's a censorship vector right there. So we're talking about a lot of problems. Are there any solutions? We've been thinking about this problem a lot for the past year, and I think we've come up with a good solution.
00:10:18.974 - 00:10:53.136, Speaker A: So, yeah, we're excited to talk about and announce Jito stake Net. It's a self sustaining and decentralized protocol for operating intelligent stake pools. And with stake net, Jitosol becomes timeless. That means Jita Sol can live forever on Solana, we don't have any of these issues anymore. We think that this is a huge step forward in liquid staking, and this is, like, for liquid staking to truly scale. I think that stake net is the answer. So, yeah, like, why stake net? We talked a lot about this before.
00:10:53.136 - 00:11:16.584, Speaker A: I think it's important to dive into. Stake net is secure. So all the code will be open source. Open source, validator set. It'll be transparent. So all of the logic for how the stake pool runs and delegates stake and removes stake from bad performing validators moves them to good validators. That will all be open source on Solana.
00:11:16.584 - 00:11:40.644, Speaker A: All the code will be an anchor. It'll be anchor verified, all that good stuff. It's decentralized. So, you know, there's going to be a network of keepers running it that I'll dive into in a little bit. Basically, these keepers can run anywhere in the world, and it's also intelligent. The entire stake pool. Stake machine is running on chain, and we think this is pretty cool.
00:11:40.644 - 00:12:04.264, Speaker A: I don't think this has been done before, so we're excited to talk more about it. So, yeah. What is Stakenet? It's a network of keepers and on chain programs to transparently operate intelligent stake pools. There's a few pieces to it. There's a keeper network. These keepers operate steward in the validator history program. These are the two main programs.
00:12:04.264 - 00:12:22.826, Speaker A: The validator history program. It's storing cryptographically verified validator performance of validators on Solana. I'll dive into that in a little bit. And then there's also a steward program. Steward program. It essentially operates the stake pool. That's where all the state machine logic lives.
00:12:22.826 - 00:12:52.774, Speaker A: So these two things work hand in hand to run the stake pool. Custom scoring and delegation logic. Yeah, the delegation logic will all be on chain. The parameters for the stake pool and how it operates will all be on chain as well. So you can actually transparently use governance to kind of adjust the parameters of the stake pool. And there's no staker funds at risk here. Stakers can't get rugged.
00:12:52.774 - 00:13:12.032, Speaker A: So one of the first programs that I talked about, it's a validator history program. Here's some data. This is actually living on Solana right now starting September 6. And this is all 100% on chain. It's all cryptographically verified. You can trust the data. It's pulling from vote accounts on Solana.
00:13:12.032 - 00:13:35.840, Speaker A: It's the same accounts that Solana uses for consensus. So you can see some of the validators that we pulled here. There are different voting credits over the past few epochs. This data started on September 6. There's enough space for around three years of data per validator. So we can actually start going way back and start. You can see if validators are performing commission rugs.
00:13:35.840 - 00:14:00.396, Speaker A: You can see if downtime is happening. You can see that showing up. It's all on chain. Typically, this is before this is in databases. So it's pretty cool. There's a lot of people, there's like nonstick pools that want to see this. And I think it'll also be cool because, you know, you can, if you run a validator monitoring website or something, you can read this data on chain and read the historical analysis of it.
00:14:00.396 - 00:14:35.172, Speaker A: And there's no centralized database at all. And then yeah, you can also see this validator version change. If you guys are validators or you've been following along with the network, you know that it recently upgraded from 114 to 116. So you can actually see that changing here. Some of the validators were already running it, saw a validator, that kind of geo one that was running 116, went back to 114 for a little bit went back to 116. And this is actually pulling data from gossip, so gossip. None of that data is on chain, but it's all signature verified.
00:14:35.172 - 00:15:19.294, Speaker A: So we're using the built in Solana signature verification precompile to upload that on chain in a trustless way. All of this will be open source as well. We look forward to more people contributing to this data. So stake net's intelligent, it's easy to audit. This is current state machine that we're working with right now. So essentially what will happen is every roughly ten epochs there will be a new validator set that gets computed. The current validator set will, the lower performing ones in the validator set, they will get kicked out, the new ones will get added, and so on.
00:15:19.294 - 00:16:12.068, Speaker A: This is operated by the network of keepers, so anyone can call into this state machine and try to trigger states in it. And basically it shouldn't allow any invalid states. It'll be easy to audit, taking a lot of time in developing the state machine. So that's easy to read, easy to test, easy to modify as well. And yeah, basically the whole goal of this is like, if we want to run stake pools forever, they need to be able to handle validators coming in and out of the validator set, malicious validators, validator downtime, different versions of validators. Maybe you want stake pools to run variations of validator sets, maybe you have version requirements on validators. All this can live on chain.
00:16:12.068 - 00:16:50.674, Speaker A: And I think it's pretty cool. And yeah, I think it's pretty customizable. You can use a mixture of governance or algorithmic based detection. You can also backtest data. So all this data will be on chain. So if you're interested in staking and you think that you can write a better staking algorithm than this, then you can use that data on chain and look at it and see, I'm pretty excited to see what community comes up with. So yeah, what are kind of the next steps here? So we're going to kick off security audits pretty soon here.
00:16:50.674 - 00:17:33.374, Speaker A: Pretty excited to get that started and get those kicked off. Part of this program is running on Mainnet right now. So the validator history program that I talked about earlier, that's running on Mainnet, it's been running since September 6. So there's currently almost two months of data on there. And then we want to get the steward program and the rest of the stake pool over on there, and then eventually transition Geetosol to that pool so it can live forever. I think there's a lot of cool data that we can add to these programs too. Stuff like the IP address will be on chain so you can figure out validator's location.
00:17:33.374 - 00:18:01.634, Speaker A: A lot of location databases use centralized APIs. Maybe there's a way to determine someone's location in a decentralized manner. Skip rate, that will help a lot. Skip rate is the amount of blocks that validators are skipping. It's kind of an indication of how well they're performing. Timely vote credits will go in soon. This ensures that validators are voting on time that will impact their score in the stake pool.
00:18:01.634 - 00:18:54.900, Speaker A: There are some validators that are doing some things that aren't super beneficial, and we want to make sure that Jito Soul doesn't delegate to those people, reward the validators that are actually doing good work. Another piece of this is like the economic analysis. So how do you make sure that things run forever? I think people need to be rewarded. If you're a Solana validator, you need to be rewarded for running a validator. And I think that if we want this to run forever, we need to figure out the economic incentive and how that works. You know, how the payout works as well. Also at the beginning, this will be a v one, and we think that every stake pool will switch to using stakenet in the future so that they can get access to infinite lsts.
00:18:54.900 - 00:19:29.194, Speaker A: So we want to spend a lot of time working with other stake pools and projects to platformize the stake, the steward program, the state machine, and then the validator history as well. So yeah, we're excited to talk about stake net today. We hope that you guys are excited about this as we are. I think there's something cool about having liquid staking tokens that can live forever. And we're excited for Jitasol to be the first liquid staking token to do that. Thank you. Thank you.
