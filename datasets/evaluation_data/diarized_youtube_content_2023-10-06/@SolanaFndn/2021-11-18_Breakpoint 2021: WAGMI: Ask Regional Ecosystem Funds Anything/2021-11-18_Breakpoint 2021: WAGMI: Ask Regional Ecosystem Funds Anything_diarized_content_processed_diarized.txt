00:00:18.320 - 00:00:19.634, Speaker A: These mics are not good.
00:00:22.574 - 00:01:18.674, Speaker B: Hello, everybody. I hope your day is going well. I'm Ben Sprango. I am the head of strategy at Solana Labs, here for an awesome panel with some of our regional ecosystem funds to talk about investing in the Solana ecosystem and broader space regionally across the world. So one of the goals that we set out to do about six to twelve months ago was we felt that Solana needed a broad reach into other parts of the world. And instead of hiring in each jurisdiction around the world, it was best to partner with people who were already there, had boots on the ground, and had the connections necessary to invest in those ecosystems efficiently. So that led to us setting up these regional ecosystem funds where we co sponsor a fund with them, co invest on every deal and share in the diligence.
00:01:18.674 - 00:01:24.862, Speaker B: So I'm joined by some of those guys here today, and I'll start with you and we'll just run through some introductions. Yeah.
00:01:24.878 - 00:01:38.284, Speaker C: Hi everyone, my name is Josh Hahn. I'm representing Rok Capital, based in Seoul, Korea. We bring a lot of bd help marketing, go to market strategy and community management services. We also run create a blockchain week. So, yeah, happy to be here.
00:01:39.184 - 00:02:01.724, Speaker D: Hey, guys, I'm Bill Sherman. I'm co founder of Solar ecofund. We invest across the spectrum from Defi gaming, NFts and web3. We have over 20 projects already in our portfolio, so we're very active. Of course we invest across the globe, but we're based in Brazil and in Israel, so we're always helpful with LAtam and Middle eastern issues.
00:02:02.784 - 00:02:21.164, Speaker A: Hi guys, my name is John park. I'm representing a 41 ventures as a managing partner and we're focused on the early stage investment only. And our expertise is at community building and also supporting the grassroots organizations like student clubs in Korea and also the dev groups in Korea.
00:02:21.864 - 00:02:47.684, Speaker E: I'm Arthur Kwan, founder of ever new capital. We're based out of Taiwan and we recently launched a Solana ecosystem fund with Solana launched in July. So it's a $20 million fund and we're backing seeds, private stage companies that want to access Taiwan's market, which is positioned as really one of the few Mandarin speaking countries that have a really strong and vibrant developer community. So that's how we like to pipel our projects.
00:02:48.104 - 00:03:28.704, Speaker B: Thanks, guys. Also, before we get started, I want to note that this is supposed to be a q and a panel. So there are people on both sides of the seats here, so you can walk up to them. Please raise your hand. They have microphones where you can ask questions, and then we'll get to those questions in a few minutes. But Josh, just starting with you, so I would love to dive in to each of you individually, based on your jurisdiction around the world, how has investing in the Solana ecosystem been there in comparison to what you've seen elsewhere and maybe diving into some of the challenges and benefits of what you've seen in comparison?
00:03:28.824 - 00:03:57.144, Speaker C: Yeah, so definitely Korea is a new user to Solana. I'd say we came recently in the last two months, and if you look at a lot of our community management numbers, I think orca radium, their numbers in Korea are going up drastically. So really, really happy about that. We're not sending them to a centralized exchange. The biggest exchange up, it recently listed Seoul as well, SPL. So we're getting a lot of people through that. Withdrawing and getting to actually use adapts.
00:03:57.924 - 00:04:07.860, Speaker B: Very cool. So the fact that the centralized exchanges in your jurisdiction, implementing SPL support is a large onboarding factor to the salon ecosystem.
00:04:07.932 - 00:04:32.636, Speaker C: Absolutely huge. Just because you need the Korean won offboarding fiat. And once you have that, you don't really need people to buy all coins necessarily. They only need to buy soul and then withdraw to Phantom. And then we're seeing a lot of improvements on that. And I'm personally really happy to see and send korean people to use our portfolio companies as well as earn interest on their assets.
00:04:32.780 - 00:04:33.980, Speaker B: Awesome. Great.
00:04:34.052 - 00:05:01.554, Speaker D: Bill, I can say in Brazil we have a huge crypto community. It's a country with 200 million people. Only 3 million invest in the stock market and 50 million have crypto. So it's a very large market. Certainly a problem that some projects have. There is banking, and what we usually recommend is simply to not bank and just have crypto. Especially now with Solana, you can pay our employees with almost zero fees.
00:05:02.094 - 00:05:20.954, Speaker B: That's awesome. So have you seen a lack of investment in other applications on crypto rails since the focus has primarily in Brazil been banking related? Or is there also a community of things that we're all used to? Web three, nfts, other things like that.
00:05:21.334 - 00:05:47.900, Speaker D: Brazil is very used to copying american things that have already worked and doing, like, local versions. And the largest startups in Brazil are that. And certainly, for example, the biggest brazilian project is BRZ, which is the brazilian version of USDC. I can say, for example, for our fund, we love to invest more in Brazil, but there are very few projects. So we invest across the globe for the other reason.
00:05:48.012 - 00:05:48.744, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:05:49.524 - 00:06:39.176, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I think what, I agree a lot with what Josh has said, but so centralized exchanges, enlisting Solana definitely spearheaded, like, a lot of the community movement inside Korea. But at the same time, I would like to emphasize the point that Solana season Hackathon and Solana ignition hackathons were actually the big attractors for a lot of the korean devs from moving from the solidity to actually rust and actually try out. For instance, 841 has been sponsoring the Korea Rust dev group, which has 40 engineers inside it, and we're sponsoring them, venues, food and drinks, so that I could actually gather and come out to hackathons. So, for example, for ignition hackathon, we had about three teams that came out from Korea to Solana ignition Hackathon. They all made to judge this list. One of them actually won the prize, actually.
00:06:39.176 - 00:07:05.750, Speaker A: So it was very amazing because all these developers were not really used to rust, but they slowly started learning about Solana after they see the global hackathon announcements. And I think Solana, like foundation itself, has been doing a good job in terms of getting that global exposure to devs. Like, oh, why don't you actually start building a Solana? Right. So I think that's a very good movement and signal for the ecosystem so that, like, ecosystem buildings and community builders like me could actually push it forward inside Korea or inside Asia.
00:07:05.862 - 00:07:33.148, Speaker B: Right. You actually bring up something I'd love to touch on really quick, is like the rust community globally and in your own jurisdiction. So one of the biggest challenges that we had in the earlier days was the majority of the developers in crypto are solidity based. So I would love to hear from you what it's been like to help cultivate that rust community in your own jurisdiction and how that is leading to the projects that you guys are allocating to there.
00:07:33.236 - 00:08:15.164, Speaker A: So when cultivating a dev group, it is really hard if you just start from scratch. But, like, when they have a goal, when they have objective, it's actually easier for them to actually get the fervor to actually start doing something, if per se. If we didn't have a hackathon, if I just created a Rust dev group with other guys and sponsored that, probably ten or five people will just show up and they'll be like, oh, I don't know anything about rust, so can you teach me? But it's not going to happen that way. It's all about self learning. All the devs are all into self learning. In order to have that self learning, you got to have motivation. And that motivation, I think Solana has done a great job in terms of just giving that opportunities to put your products, ship it in front of the global public, and get the feedbacks from the global judges.
00:08:15.164 - 00:08:44.116, Speaker A: So cultivating a dev group is always a problem for every other ecosystem too. But I would definitely recommend the track of going with global hackathons and moving with your ambassadors in the region or the people who have been supporting the region for so long. I've been supporting, supporting salon since 2018 to 19. Right. So find those people, just work with them, sponsor them, support them, so they can actually move with local people. Then that's it. That's the way to go to cultivate the group.
00:08:44.180 - 00:08:51.036, Speaker B: That's awesome. I'm happy to hear that the hackathons are doing what we intended. Arthur, please.
00:08:51.140 - 00:09:26.042, Speaker E: Sure, yeah. Similar, I think, in Taiwan. The rest developer community that also wants to do blockchain is pretty small, but we have been focusing on cultivating and training new rust developers with, for example, Z institute, a blockchain school in Taiwan. So our plan is to continuously train, you know, hundreds of developers building on Rust and Solana every year. And I think that's a really a scarce asset these days. Just good developers who could really scale and execute well. That's going to be so helpful to all these projects within our jurisdiction.
00:09:26.042 - 00:09:55.924, Speaker E: Also without, everyone I speak to are hiring developers. So we hope to have some QC and quality control around high quality devs. And I think that could scale globally. So that's been one of our main focus in Taiwan. The other thing is also we realize that in addition to developers, you need good founders and good CEO's. It's really about building a project and thinking of it as building a company. Any good engineering support, marketing, the whole, whole package.
00:09:55.924 - 00:10:12.100, Speaker E: And so we may also start to incubate projects next year out of these strong developer groups that we're training and also just on stage. I think there are lots of opportunities to cross fertilize in different jurisdictions as well, because ultimately it's a global play. Right?
00:10:12.212 - 00:10:30.078, Speaker B: Right, absolutely. From what you've seen, where would you say everyone needs developers? From what you've seen beyond developers, what do people need in Taiwan for these projects that they're spinning up? If they're very developer heavy, who are they looking for and where are they finding them?
00:10:30.166 - 00:11:02.056, Speaker E: Yeah, I think Dev's number one. And I think also just the right type of marketing support, the right channel, the right type of messaging. It's a fine line. I mean, a lot of it is narrative these days, but you could easily overhype up a project. Right. So finding the right type of marketing support, I think is so crucial. I think the other aspect also is finding the right because not all developers are good CEO's, right? And I think the Taiwan market is currently lacking kind of strong CEO's who could scale globally.
00:11:02.056 - 00:11:09.476, Speaker E: So we either have to identify them, train them or find partners in other jurisdictions to work on that together.
00:11:09.600 - 00:11:17.064, Speaker B: Right. Awesome. So I can't really see out there, but are there any questions?
00:11:18.324 - 00:12:39.110, Speaker A: Could I add briefly to what Arthur was saying? Could I add briefly please? So like Arthur is visiting Korea soon. I think we're going to meet up and we're going to talk about how to collaborate too because of the geographical proximity. But at the same time I kind of agree with what Arthur says because not just I wouldn't say that devs are not good CEO's, but at the same time a lot of the people who are joining the ecosystem right now are not used to the pace of like how the company is formed and how the fund is raised and how you have to move really really fast in terms of recruiting and you have to deal with all these money that has just come in, huge stockpile of cash, it's sitting on your bank account, you have to use it, how to do it properly, how to manage the relationship with the VC's or investors. There are so many people nowadays who are just thinking that VC's don't add values or whatever, but like, you know, it could be just one of the, one of the atmosphere, but at the same time you need to like learn who's just like who could events, who's gonna be the good investors, what are the characteristics of the good investors and who are the marketing agents that you wanna work with and like, you know, these are the types of, you know, things that you need to know as like, you know, good CEO's. Right? So like, you know, that's the part that if there is anything that foundation could do, like, I know there's a lot of ventures coming off in the foundation. So that could be one of the helps for a lot of the regional ecosystem as well. Because of the geographical distance.
00:12:39.110 - 00:12:57.046, Speaker A: It is really important for some kind of documentation or some kind of tutorial that's being given out from the foundation is going to be essential for all these builders to have more safe zone, I guess, to feel more comfortable. To feel more comfortable in terms of building out and shipping in the product to the global stage, right?
00:12:57.230 - 00:13:24.834, Speaker B: Awesome. Would you say staying with receiving investments from other investors, a mantra that goes around Twitter often. That's like VC's dumping on people or VC's just getting into these deals early to make a lot of money. What is for each of you, what are the perceptions in your own jurisdiction of VC's, either in your country or globally in the crypto space?
00:13:25.934 - 00:14:05.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, Korea is home to, I would say, two big korean crypto VC's, including hashed and in terms of Solana specific TGE's. So I'm personally a fan of the ideal model that mango market's kind of like started. And I think a lot of companies or a lot of tokens are going towards that. And from my perspective, and what I see from the Solana korean community, they like that, right. It seems more fair than buying some type of ideal platform token, staking it. It's a lot more simple as well. And you have some capability there where you can take out your funds after 24 hours.
00:14:05.194 - 00:14:23.514, Speaker C: So from our perspective, we think just connecting the VC research and hey, this is why we support the project. We love it as users and having them use it first before they buy the actual governance token makes a lot more sense.
00:14:24.974 - 00:15:24.342, Speaker D: One thing that I think all founders need to have in mind is that crypto is very reflexive with users and price. So users bring price and price also bring users. And one example of that going badly, many projects that are not having cliffs to their investors, and many times what happens is on the first day you have a huge drop in price and that leads to super negative press, that leads to users being pissed that if you raise $100 million in an ido and the price goes down, you have $100 million worth of, of people mad at you. Right? So what we always advise project is have a cliff, have the unlock further away from the launch. And you saw, for example, a good example with Solana itself, you had the unlock day, but it was like a year after the investment. So the day of the unlock, it was like no one even knew about it because it was far away. That would be a general advice.
00:15:24.342 - 00:15:25.634, Speaker D: Always have a cliff.
00:15:26.614 - 00:16:36.454, Speaker A: I mean, like as investors, like as an investor, I mean, who was a community builder before? I guess a lot of the things that what VC's could do for builders could come from like experiences, like sharing experiences, like what, what I've done before and like what I seen, what I've seen as an investor, like, you know, what were the prop, more appropriate range of the valuation when you were doing a seed seed round, like when you're kicking off for such a hyper valued valuation, what kind of consequences can you actually see? And especially in the Solana ecosystem, a lot of the fundraisers right now is very experimental. And also I think it's important to have the mindset that we as an investors, we are also experimenting together. And when you're doing capped manga market style auction or uncapped mega market style auction, you know, all these kind of options, we're still seeing a lot of the experiments being done. We don't know what the consequences are going to be there for yet because we're still seeing these projects that are working on like, progressing so far. Like, so far so good. But some projects have actually sunk after they've done, like, unkept style of auction, too. So a lot of the experiences should be shared among the, from the investors to the builders.
00:16:36.454 - 00:17:29.377, Speaker A: That's what we believe. And on our side, on our jurisdiction in Korea, a lot of the retail investors actually do rely on, like, credible writing sources that could actually follow on, such as tutorials, which is what we've been providing as an investor. So I think it's really important for like, a lot of the VC's who are not the mega VC's with the brand power, then I think it's important for the VC's to actually like, you know, or investors to give those kind of tutorials, those kind of like, you know, what kind of values actually do these projects actually give to the retail investors or even the users? I think those are the really important values that VC's can add not to just the projects, but to actually the users that projects actually need. Liquidity provision is just one of the things that investors could do. But all these other soft areas that are outside of the investment should be filled by the investors. That's how I feel it and that's how I've been doing.
00:17:29.545 - 00:18:09.144, Speaker B: I just want to just go a tiny bit deeper there. So one thing that I've been seeing also on the Solana Ventures side is a lot of the people who are coming and starting projects in the Solana ecosystem are relatively unaware of how to structure a token distribution or how to do the fundraising that we all just mentioned. And that kind of leads to the question of who are we seeing enter the Solana ecosystem. Are we seeing people who've been in crypto for a long time and have been around the block and seen the Defi explosion on Ethereum and are educated? Or are these actually net new people coming into the Solana ecosystem and, and building for the first time?
00:18:10.284 - 00:18:48.450, Speaker A: I think it's a good mix. Good mix. But I've seen a lot of the. For ignition hackathon, I've seen so many new people who are coming in for season. Hackathon. I think it was more of, like, a mixed population. The best crowd that I've encountered so far is the new face, but who have actually, like, studied a lot, you know, what has happened during the Defi summer, what has happened, like, during the crypto winter, what were the failures like and how the failures started to take place? You know, when everything, every, every investor was backing, like, a certain project and the project was getting all these attention from the world, but they ended up, like, not carrying it or not shipping it because of, like, ABC, you know, these kind of reasons.
00:18:48.450 - 00:18:59.874, Speaker A: Like, you know, if you are the, if you're a builder and even if you're new to the space, if you do, like, study it right, I think you're gonna make it, like, you know. Yeah, that's how I see it. But we see a lot of new faces.
00:19:00.294 - 00:19:03.742, Speaker B: Anyone else comment on net new users or.
00:19:03.918 - 00:19:42.144, Speaker E: We're seeing still a lot of conversions from other ecosystems over to Solano. They've experienced multiple ecosystems and feel like, hey, the rust environment is still one of the better ones to build on. I think the cheaper gas is a huge opportunity for Solana right now. You know, I think it's just too expensive elsewhere on other chains at this moment. And that's a main driver for many projects I'm seeing. And certainly there are newer projects coming on board who've never been in crypto. And I think the challenges they have is really navigating the whole kind of landscape and narrative.
00:19:42.144 - 00:19:48.608, Speaker E: So they typically need a little bit more marketing support on just navigating that aspect. Right?
00:19:48.736 - 00:20:05.284, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you think that it's prudent for us to make tutorials and very detailed docs for these people? Or is this more of like a relationship building one on one? Here's how everything works. Here's what needs to be fixed. Here's where we're going.
00:20:06.064 - 00:20:34.334, Speaker E: I think it makes sense. I mean, I think either Solana could do it or, you know, I think VC's job, you know, could also be that as well. Or incubators. Right. Partnering earlier. One of the issues as a VC is you're really just selecting the best projects. But there's one step before that where, how do you train these best projects? And they could be self selecting, but I do think that there's some value in that earlier stage incubation phase.
00:20:34.794 - 00:21:08.634, Speaker C: Yeah. And just to piggyback off of that, I think Solana presents a lot of opportunities just because gas fees are so insanely cheap, where it's like, hey, maybe you never did a liquidity provision on ETH, but now you can do it for less than ten, you know, with less than $10. What I'm also seeing is like, new users are coming in through nfts, right? Like people who are never really interested in crypto, they see stuff like drop mints on radium, or they see, you know, solar analysis, like we've been talking to, and they see a lot more opportunity coming in there and have like a little bit more edge compared to like something like DeFi.
00:21:08.714 - 00:21:56.918, Speaker D: I think in terms of new users, at least from the point of view of investment, the overwhelming majority of investors in the Solana ecosystem are proprietary firms, that is, firms that are managing their own money. And those are probably people who have made money on bitcoin and ethereum ecosystem. And in terms of tutorials and stuff, what I would like to see as an investor, and I'm sure retail agrees, are more disclosures from projects. So we expect to see several disclosures from an apple, right? So which is a huge project and a public company. So why not projects which are huge, they're worth sometimes billions of dollars. Why shouldn't we see disclosures, for example, how much they have in a bank, number of employees, how much are they spending, etcetera.
00:21:57.086 - 00:21:57.766, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:57.910 - 00:22:42.964, Speaker E: To add on that .1 of the challenges I see with Saps and kind of its token based funding mechanism is a lack of proper corporate governance. And it's a concept that's not really shared in crypto. You entrust a lot of power to the founder and the team, especially right now. I don't know about you guys, but we've been sending projects USDC, like ERC 20. So I think we need a good SPL solution, multisign wallet. I want to start sending cheaper USDC over, but yeah, I think corporate governance going forward is a theme that if you really want to build a successful long term project, I think there's got to be a little bit more governance kind of structure for early BBC as we're shaping and guiding the companies.
00:22:43.504 - 00:23:14.496, Speaker B: Awesome. I'd love to, in the last few minutes that we have here, talk about something that you guys brought up, like those net new projects that are being built in the Solana ecosystem because of the infrastructure benefits that Solana offers in comparison to other layer ones. So we start with you. What kind of things are you seeing? Maybe on the social side, the gaming side, anything that is really lending itself to the infrastructure Solana provides.
00:23:14.600 - 00:23:48.252, Speaker C: Yeah, in terms of infrastructure, I'm not completely sure, but social tokens. Obviously, we have only one, and we've been supporting them a lot through their creator program. And I think there is new onboarding happening there, but it's a little bit slower than what we might have expected. Like NFTs gaming, nyan heroes, obviously they're incredible. NFT drops big wealth generation events for some people. And yeah, I would just say NFTs have been above other things, like huge onboarding for retail for us.
00:23:48.308 - 00:24:24.976, Speaker D: Yeah, internally, we classify projects, DeFi, NFT gaming and web3. And the initial part of the year and in the initial part of Solana, like launch and growth, we saw a lot of DeFi and NFT, the first two buckets, and those were projects that were many times copies of Ethereum projects or improvements. And now we're seeing the second phase, let's say a bunch of gaming and web3. And you saw Raj here talking about how he got banned. So certainly a decentralized social network is a must. A lot of people are doing that now. And of course gaming too.
00:24:24.976 - 00:24:54.900, Speaker D: You have some games on Ethereum, but of course, paying $50 per transaction is completely unusable. So certainly we already seen gaming porting to Solana and we're going to see new games. I'm also excited. For example, FTX and others are investing together with the classical gaming companies and we see, for example, Epic from Fortnite. They are starting to give grants to some projects, which is very interesting and exciting.
00:24:55.012 - 00:25:38.354, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of people actually do understand the infrastructure benefits coming from using Solana. And I think that started out with like, you know, Solana Summer. Like NFT sucked in all the liquidity out of all the other ecosystem. Also the new like retail investors. And that money is getting being now ready to be use for Solana DeFi wave. But other than that, a lot of the Defi builders now on Solana ecosystem that we encounter and we face, they come from traditional banking side, but the crazy ideas they want to realize is only available or is available with Solana's infrastructure benefits like cheaper gas and a faster transaction speed. So that makes sense for DeFi a lot.
00:25:38.354 - 00:26:16.416, Speaker A: But for gaming side, I think setting aside the infrastructure benefits, what we encounter a lot is like people are just like so into just making play to earn models, but they don't really think about like, they don't really. Sometimes they don't have in house gaming studio or gaming PD's who actually could design and do a proper architecture architecture for the whole game. And we've been passing a lot of gaming deals just because of that. Because, like, in order to make blockchain gaming games, like, real, proper games games, it has to be the games that you want to play and you. It's the games that your friends want to play, right? So I think this. These are the. So infrastructure benefits are there.
00:26:16.416 - 00:26:46.344, Speaker A: But if you're building something, it doesn't necessarily mean that, like, cheaper gas is just gonna attract the new users and just gonna, like, you know, ship your product global. It's gotta, like, if it's gaming, it has to be the good games. If it's defi, it's got to be properly designed. And if you're coming from tri fi and want to, like, adopt a crazy idea, Solana is a great place to do. So. Like, just think of, like, take into account of all these variables and then, like, you know, try to, like, you know, mold your project according to all those infrastructure benefits is really, really important. And also, like, talk a lot with the Solana Foundation.
00:26:46.344 - 00:27:00.244, Speaker A: Devs is also very important. Solana Labs is, like, all out there with advocacy groups. So, like, use discord a lot. You know, just try to engage a lot. I think that that's, that's the key for actually utilizing the maximum out of the infrastructure benefits.
00:27:00.944 - 00:27:42.370, Speaker E: One example, I'll give one of our portfolio companies, genopets, you know, the founder, Albert Chen, you know, Taiwanese American. He was Solana first, right? He was in eos, and then, you know, decided to build on Solana for all of its unique characteristics. You know, it's a move to earn game, and, you know, your pet kind of evolves based on your personal biometric data, right? So there's a lot of, kind of real time transition transaction that needs to take place. And, you know, this is really a perfect environment for that. Right? So that's just one example that I think, and many will come. And I do think in our jurisdiction in Taiwan, it kind of serves as a nice hub in Asia. You know, you've got access to Korea, Japan, and then also Southeast Asia.
00:27:42.370 - 00:27:50.622, Speaker E: And now, you know, Taiwan is still a Mandarin speaking country. You know, it certainly could help, you know, kind of propagate that Mandarin speaking market.
00:27:50.778 - 00:29:02.500, Speaker B: Right? We also invested in genopets out of Solana ventures. And one thing that got me, like, super excited about them, obviously, like, their background. Like, Albert's, like, an awesome guy, and the idea of, like, composable nfts on Solana really got me super excited. So, for context, as you move to earn you level up your character, those pieces that you put on top of them also become a part of that NFT and therefore increase the value. I'm really excited to see innovation in that area, and I think we're just on the cusp of all of that. So with our last two minutes, I would love to just, like, walk through and just get high level feedback from each of you with your specific jurisdiction of where you're located. What's the largest piece of feedback that you think the Solana ecosystem needs right now that the Solana ecosystem is getting right now, based on what's there? Is it developer tooling related? Is it things like we discussed with those blueprints for getting people net new into the Solana ecosystem? And how is that different between where each of you are located?
00:29:02.652 - 00:29:32.898, Speaker C: Yeah, I know someone briefly mentioned the disclosures. I think could be a lot better in terms of the token vesting schedules, what previous rounds raised that at VC's, what the sizing was just so, like, everyone at the public private levels is a lot more clear. The only other suggestion I have for Solana in terms of the bridge is that we should give some people some soul when they bridge and use wormhole. Because, like, compared to all the other bridges, I used another bridge yesterday. But, like, you know, I think that one aspect can really make the quality of life so much better.
00:29:33.026 - 00:29:53.584, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say take advantage of this bull market to raise money because we don't know the future, and this is the biggest bull market in history. And it's also, Solana gives you the opportunity to decentralize things that weren't possible with Ethereum and others. So it's a huge opportunity on social and gaming on all sectors.
00:29:54.444 - 00:30:25.064, Speaker A: I mean, if it's a feedback that we could give to, like, Solana ventures or Solana ecosystem as a whole, like, in a foundation and, like, you know, please like to provide more community support in terms of, like, languages assistance and also developer cultivation as well. Because a lot of people are, like, when they face the encounter, when they encounter the difficulties, sometimes they just stop because of the language hurdles. So that could be one thing that you could also put a lot of efforts on and collaborate with regional players like us who can actually speak both languages fluently.
00:30:25.644 - 00:30:31.026, Speaker E: I would suggest we need more tools, even a multisig solution for Solano be awesome.
00:30:31.130 - 00:30:34.934, Speaker B: Yeah. Thanks, guys. Sorry, we're overtime. Thank you guys for joining us.
00:30:35.754 - 00:30:36.194, Speaker E: Thank you.
