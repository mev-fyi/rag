00:00:04.360 - 00:00:05.646, Speaker A: Okay, welcome.
00:00:05.750 - 00:00:06.526, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:06.670 - 00:00:13.110, Speaker A: 2023. It's really nice to be in Amsterdam. You are a veteran, though, of breakpoint?
00:00:13.222 - 00:00:15.614, Speaker B: I am. I had a great time at Breakpoint.
00:00:15.654 - 00:00:27.666, Speaker A: Last year, but I would love for the audience to get to know a little bit more about your journey broadly into this space. And what excited you about what, web3 in the beginning?
00:00:27.770 - 00:01:04.622, Speaker B: Yeah. So I was working for Zappos, the commerce company based in Las Vegas, and they were undergoing a transition to decentralized decision making. And it was pretty interesting because it was probably one of the biggest companies to do this at the time. There were about 1500 people, and it was essentially a precursor of decentralized organizations, or daos, but we didn't know it, and so there was a lot of messiness. It was very interesting to see that in action. And because of that, I got really interested in decentralized governance. I then learned about web3, and so I went to airswap, which was an early decentralized exchange.
00:01:04.622 - 00:01:16.694, Speaker B: I led business development there. And then after that I went to Amazon to AWS to lead go to market for Amazon managed blockchain. So kind of saw a bit of the startup side of things and then the enterprise side of things, and now I'm at a 16 z.
00:01:16.854 - 00:01:32.660, Speaker A: That's awesome. And would you say that the kind of idea of decentralization broadly from where you kind of first came across it at Zappos, has evolved as we go towards web3, or has it remained largely the same in principle?
00:01:32.852 - 00:01:56.334, Speaker B: I'd say it's definitely evolved. There's kind of these stages of decentralization in many ways. The single vote, so single token, single vote method that's evolved quite a bit. It's still evolving. And what's really cool about crypto and web3 is that you're able to go through these stages of governance in much faster ways than you would in, let's say, a city or a traditional government.
00:01:56.494 - 00:03:01.462, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the themes that's come up for the folks that have been listening to talks at breakpoint so far is the idea of standing on the shoulders of giants. And that's true kind of ideologically, in terms of the principles of decentralization, and also technically in terms of how we're continuing to build or iterate on the products that we deliver now. And so obviously, go to market is a discipline that's been studied by businesses since the beginning of time. I think it's meaningful to kind of like frame where we want to begin the conversation around go to market because it's a broad topic so for today, we're going to focus the content really largely on decentralized applications, Dapps or DApps, versus thinking specifically about the different things that you would think about going to market if you were an l one or an exchange. So with that in mind, there's kind of like two broad buckets that largely encompass go to market. First is around kind of customer acquisition, and then second being kind of the organizational models that you choose to support those decisions.
00:03:01.462 - 00:03:18.664, Speaker A: So let's start with customer acquisition. You've had a long tenure thinking about that in different business models. Can you tell us a little bit about the tactics that have changed in go to market broadly and kind of extend the timeline however long you want?
00:03:18.784 - 00:04:06.314, Speaker B: Absolutely. So I think web3 really opened up two different types of go to market tactics that didn't exist in web two. The first is token based incentives. And so this is things like airdrops, allow lists, open edition mints, and the second is just really having all the information on chain, and so being able to see what's going on on chain with wallets, et cetera. And what I think is great is if you have go to market strategies that are actually combining those two sets of tactics, that's really where they're the most effective. It's almost hard to talk about any individual tactic, because if there's a successful go to market tactic, oftentimes your competitors will kind of go onto that, and everyone's doing that, seems like for a period of time, whereas I think more effective is thinking more broadly about these strategies and then being able to deploy certain tactics as needed.
00:04:06.974 - 00:04:13.716, Speaker A: Do you have an example that comes to mind of something where those two things have been combined in a meaningful way?
00:04:13.910 - 00:04:54.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think any, you know, any app, I don't have a specific example, but in terms of any app thinking about that kind of user acquisition and then the engagement, I think it goes to some of the points we were talking about around retention and stickiness. So if, you know, in web3, users have choice, and so if you don't have a great front end or great experience, they're able to easily port over to something else. They can take their decentralized social network and move to another front end or their decentralized trading, their Defi trading. And so what's really important is you don't just have this one time acquisition, but you're constantly reacquiring these users. Instead of you have the one time acquisition, you're engaging them. It's great. They're there.
00:04:54.540 - 00:05:12.140, Speaker B: They're kind of stuck in web3, you constantly actually have to reacquire them. And so I think the best apps, or Dapps are the ones that are thinking about this and really engaging these users. Just like it's day one. Right. So that they always have to be, be thinking about that acquisition.
00:05:12.252 - 00:06:08.944, Speaker A: Yeah, it can be pretty exhausting. You think you have a loyal group of contributors or followers, and you have to kind of constantly be evaluating and calibrating what's valuable and interesting to that community. And in principle, I think that's why many people are interested in web3. But it also can be tremendously fatiguing on the business side of things. When you think you've landed on a strategy and you're kind of constantly having to pivot. The kind of like old school way of talking about that is like filling your funnel, right? You've got people at the top and you kind of move down, and the lower you move down the funnel, the more retention or stickiness that you might assume that you can have. If we start at the top, you know, kind of the ways in which that has been done have also changed over the course of web3, from kind of like the web, the airdropping traditions to now, which is, it's less common that that's the way that you kind of fill your funnel.
00:06:08.944 - 00:06:22.076, Speaker A: Can you talk about some of the things that you're seeing recently that represent the kind of, like, current ways or best practices that you've seen different projects fill the top of their funnel?
00:06:22.180 - 00:06:53.578, Speaker B: It's funny because I'm actually seeing a return to more, I guess, web two native methodologies. And so these are things like advertising or sponsorships. And what's really interesting is the coming together of the more web3, native tactics and web two. And this could be everything from off chain and on chain. And where I still think there's room for improvement is that these are oftentimes siloed. So if you think about these two flywheels, one is the analysis and kind of understanding of your current user and existing user. So think attribution and any sort of analysis.
00:06:53.578 - 00:07:29.370, Speaker B: And that is very common. There are many, many teams that have solutions for that, both in web two and web3. And then the second is, once you know something about your users, how are you acting upon them? So what is that engagement and discovery model? And again, there are many teams doing that. But what I haven't seen as much is those two things come together. And so whether that's a truly web two and web3 integrated model for both understanding who your users are, and then doing something to engage them, or an on chain or off chain thing. So that's where I continue. Again, many teams are working on it, but I haven't seen this great synergy of the two.
00:07:29.562 - 00:08:40.086, Speaker A: One of the value propositions that I think many people hope for in the kind of like, cross pollination type of customer, consumer user acquisition is that there might be this tranche of users in one area of your landscape that aren't aware of the value that they could achieve in another capacity. So a specific example is, you have a bunch of people in DeFi, but are they really engaged in gaming in a meaningful way? Does the composability of their value transfer across those things? Again, it's one of these things that get talks about ideologically, but it's kind of few and far between where we've seen it actually come into practice. One thing that I noticed recently, and this team's been brought up a lot at breakpoint, but Drip is a really interesting project that was very effectively able to do a campaign with Genopets, the gaming team, to airdrop assets to users, to essentially onboard them into this game. I thought it was a really interesting new way that I've seen a project acquire users. So web3 to web3 native, which ultimately, we hope we see more and more of.
00:08:40.150 - 00:08:40.994, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:08:41.974 - 00:09:12.970, Speaker A: Okay. So, Kay, the final thing is, do you think that there's any untested model that we haven't talked about yet that just exists in a hypothetical world that we should invite the broader community to think about in the same way that Toli invites you to think about a large technical problem? Is there a go to market paradigm that we know of from the web? Two days, or I guess they're not past tense, they're current. But we should think about testing in the web3 world.
00:09:13.162 - 00:09:34.350, Speaker B: I think it goes back to this point of just truly understanding who your user is. I've heard from web two corporates, you don't have a great understanding of your customer because you don't have maybe standard demographic information, and then vice versa, the web3 teams are saying, we actually have tons of information. We know every single transaction that's happening. And so, again, I think it's really about being able to fuse those two sides.
00:09:34.462 - 00:10:06.284, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's very true. I think many of us that work in this space are desire to have more data driven ways of taking next steps and planning our way. Ways in which we're deploying resources, whether they're product or financial or otherwise. Okay, switching gears a little bit from the kind of like customer acquisition bucket to the model bucket. For those of you who don't know. Actually Maggie writes quite a bit about go to market. There's an article she wrote about a year and a half ago that I often reference.
00:10:06.284 - 00:10:37.234, Speaker A: I invite you to check it out as well. It's on the A 16 Z website. I'm actually going to read a piece of it. I want to make sure that I quote you correctly. In web two, the primary go to market stakeholder is the customer, typically acquired via sales and marketing efforts. In web3, an organization's go to market stakeholders can include not just their customers and users, but also their developers, investors and partners. Many web3 companies therefore find community roles to be more critical than their sales and marketing roles.
00:10:37.234 - 00:10:49.130, Speaker A: So that's pretty novel and interesting. And I'm curious, since you wrote that a year and a half ago, do you still think that's true or has anything macro changed the importance of community?
00:10:49.322 - 00:11:05.094, Speaker B: I would modify it slightly. And so I think the notion of marketing marketing to a group community is about building with, and so it's actually equally important in today's environment to have both. So in that sense, I'd say marketing has come back a little bit in importance.
00:11:05.794 - 00:11:51.516, Speaker A: I certainly think so. From our side of things, we're very grateful for our effective marketing team then kind of on that note, when we think about the kind of internal strengths that exist within any organization or project, and kind of the outside or external powers that they need to collaborate with to be meaningful, there's often tension, whether it's within your own organization or that kind of internal and external friction. And I think that's something that is a very universal experience for people that have thought about how they want to go to market. I'm curious if you've thought or observed about how to address that friction in a productive way.
00:11:51.700 - 00:12:31.268, Speaker B: I mean, I feel like every single team probably has some version of this challenge weekly, if not daily. It's basically which sub departments or teams have the most say. And I think oftentimes it really comes back to being aligned in what you're building. So understanding what the purpose of the company is and kind of what that translates into in terms of priorities. So one example from my time at Airswap was we were very, very focused on having a great user experience, and that translated to things like potentially not shipping things as fast because we were working on the experience, more design, more eng efforts. And so that's for us how we decided to go about it. Another team might be prioritizing something different.
00:12:31.268 - 00:12:42.434, Speaker B: Right. They might be prioritizing time to market. And so I think it just depends on being really clear about what those core pillars are, and then the decisions and the tradeoffs actually come much more naturally from there.
00:12:42.774 - 00:13:30.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's really true. I think one thing that's also worth mentioning, kind of like on this general thread, is that I think there's something to be said about contributing to the overarching study or work of going to market through writing. But then there's also the doing part of it as well. Right. How do you actually help the practice of go to market be meaningfully influenced? And one of the ways that you and your team have done that is through something called the crypto startup school. Phantom, one of the wallets on the Solana ecosystem, was one of the first members of that class three years ago in crypto. That's 100 years ago, and now you are launching a new crypto startup school and you're doing it in London.
00:13:30.380 - 00:13:38.996, Speaker A: Can you tell us a little bit about why London and what we can expect to learn about this upcoming class?
00:13:39.140 - 00:14:08.642, Speaker B: Absolutely. Very excited to share about this. This is now will be our third iteration of crypto startup school. So our most recent batch we ran in LA over the spring, it was 26 teams, and it was a very standard accelerator model and actually quite global. What was really important to us was to have teams from around the world moving to London, I think will only increase that, give us more exposure to the amazing entrepreneurs in this region. Say, why London? Three things. One is really the strong educational system.
00:14:08.642 - 00:14:36.678, Speaker B: That's something that is really important and the kind of feeder for founders. The second is it's a hub for finance and media, just in the way New York or other cities are. And the third is that London has kind of this potential for clear and practical regulation. And that's obviously so critical in today's environment. And so for all these reasons, we actually just had our London office opening party a few days ago, which I just came from. We're so excited to be there and hope to welcome you. And we're in process.
00:14:36.678 - 00:14:44.314, Speaker B: So we have closed applications for this next batch of CSS candidates and we're in process of reviewing, so hope to see some of you there.
00:14:45.374 - 00:15:11.962, Speaker A: Awesome. Super exciting for folks that aren't as familiar with, like what the teams get exposed to within the crypto startup school. Would you share a little bit more about kind of like what that looks like? You know, when a team comes in, they get exposure to certain types of content and criteria and when they come out x or y, then changes. Can you talk a little bit about that?
00:15:12.058 - 00:15:44.054, Speaker B: Absolutely. We have founder talks. So last year, Brian Armstrong spoke Toli came and was able to show some of the saga phones, which was great. And every week was really themed around a different topic. So things like what blockchain should I be thinking about building on, go to market and marketing communications? How do you hire and build a team? So it's really these elements, all the things you would need to build a business, but in a very, very web3 native way. And what's important to us is that every single team is web3 native. That's the ethos of our fund, and we're very much there to support that.
00:15:44.384 - 00:16:56.472, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the things that we often think about when we've done different versions of this, whether it's post hackathon or thinking about how you incubate teams similarly, is what does the team really need to be successful? If you asked holy, he'd say a roof and Internet, that's it. He really just wants the basics. And then you can go onto the other side of things with the Y Combinator model, which is much more robust and more reflective of our curriculum. But I think one of the most important pieces that we've learned in the experiments that we've done in this arena is actually the composition of your peers and the people that you are surrounded by when you're also, whether you could have different business models or theses around how you want to approach web3. But the importance of who you're surrounded by is maybe more meaningful than no offense to Brian Armstrong or Tolle, anything else that you can deliver in those programs? Can you tell us a little bit about how you think about the composition of a class and how your team thinks about the different types of perspectives that are brought amongst peers in a class?
00:16:56.648 - 00:17:28.893, Speaker B: Absolutely. We don't have any targets or things that we absolutely have to have, but it really is about looking across the web3 ecosystem, and so it's an open application anyone can apply. This year we added something called the Nakamoto Challenge. And so it was kind of these big open questions in crypto that if you were able to answer one of them successfully, we would fast track you for an interview. So really looking at builders and so some of the questions in the application give you a sense of what we're looking for in terms of when was your first wallet created, things like that.
00:17:29.833 - 00:18:17.454, Speaker A: I'm super excited to see how that, you know, turns out and comes to works be and one of the things that our foundation, Solana foundation, is dedicated to is spending more time in international markets. And so that's one of the reasons why we're having breakpoint 2024 in Singapore. And so I'm thrilled to hear how kind of a new center, or kind of like center of gravity for the crypto startup school is also going to change the ways in which teams that aren't necessarily based in North America, who, you know, a lot of times we spend time with, also get an opportunity to benefit. All right, so we're coming towards the end of our time. Is there anything else along the lines of go to market or any key takeaways that you'd like to leave with the audience?
00:18:18.434 - 00:19:05.790, Speaker B: I'd say that some of them are actually definitional. When you think about the word community, probably everyone in this audience has a different definition of that. And something I learned a long time ago when I was working in Las Vegas was that definition is very personal. And community is so critical to teams here. So I think point one is to actually actively define what that means to you. So when you talk about your community, who is that and why are they important? And then tied to that is really engagement. And so what do you mean by engagement? Are you looking for engagement in terms of someone opening an app every single day? That sort of engagement? Are you looking for quality of engagement? What does that really mean? And I think having those two things defined company wide can, again, really help you determine what your go to market strategy should be.
00:19:05.982 - 00:19:21.094, Speaker A: I completely agree. It's not just semantics. It actually helps drive alignment and strategy. Well, that is our time for today. Maggie, thank you so much for joining us. And we'll look forward to tracking the London crypto startup school. Maggie, thanks.
