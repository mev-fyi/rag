00:00:00.320 - 00:00:10.646, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. GMGM. I'm Nick from the Solana foundation. And today I'm joined by Noah from the Helium foundation, and we're going to talk about the helium network. How are you doing today, Noah?
00:00:10.790 - 00:00:15.294, Speaker B: Good, good. We got the migration coming in just about a week. Sitting pretty.
00:00:15.454 - 00:00:27.834, Speaker A: We certainly do. So let's go ahead and just dive in and we'll talk about the upcoming Solana migration, kind of why blockchain? Why Solana? And I guess let's start with like a background of what the helium network is.
00:00:28.384 - 00:01:18.934, Speaker B: Yeah, so helium is the largest people run network. I think at, you know, marketing, you see it called the people's Network. What that means is that individual people, like literally anybody can run a hotspot and provide signal on the helium network. So when you think about like, traditional networking models, you have like Verizon or at and T, and they go out and they set out like a 5g hotspot, and that gives signal to your phone. With helium, they're unveiling a 5g network, and it's people like you and me, they buy a hotspot, they put it up, and by doing that, they mine tokens for providing network. So helium has the largest, lower one network in the world, which is for like IoT devices, temperature sensors, package tracking, things like that. And then it's also rolling out new networks like 5g.
00:01:18.934 - 00:01:41.024, Speaker B: So typically you'll hear the term DPIn, which stands for decentralized physical infrastructure network, which helium is definitely classified as. It's very decentralized and it's providing physical infrastructure. The other term that I've heard to describe this is tip in, which is token incentivized physical infrastructure network, which helium also is.
00:01:41.484 - 00:01:53.514, Speaker A: I guess if all of this physical infrastructure has already existed in the past, you have traditional cell towers and cell networks and other wireless networks. Why use blockchain for this type of technology?
00:01:54.454 - 00:02:54.644, Speaker B: I think you're able to deploy things faster and better when it's people doing it. If Verizon wants to go deploy something, they need to go buy land to set up a tower for signals like 5g, where it doesn't go as far. They're not really good at getting that last mile, they can go build a giant tower and provide 4g, but 5g doesn't have as much range and something like IoT, they're not that interested in providing the network for it. So it's so much easier for somebody to just go buy one of these things and put it on the roof of their house. But also it solves this chicken and egg problem where we've solidified into oligopolies of wireless providers. Nobody can really compete with them because nobody's going to buy your network when, like, no user is going to use your network when it has no coverage. But you also have this chicken and egg problem where like, you can't get enough money to build up the coverage because you don't have users.
00:02:54.644 - 00:03:24.476, Speaker B: So when you do this with blockchain and you incentivize it with tokens, what happens is people are incentivized to kind of build this network out because they're, you know, early on and there are more tokens getting emitted early on, and they're kind of sharing that risk with you because they're helping build the network. And so helium was able to bootstrap this massive network out of nowhere, and now is bootstrapping all of this usage on top of the network. And blockchain really did help solve that chicken and egg problem.
00:03:24.660 - 00:03:46.160, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So it's using tokenized incentives to encourage everyday people like you and I to run these hotspots, which are just, which are basically just really strong Wi Fi routers in a way, and they can just run them at home, run them at work, support this decentralized physical infrastructure network. That's the gist of it.
00:03:46.312 - 00:04:04.216, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's really cool if you like, if there's no coverage in an area and you want there to be coverage, all you have to do is go buy some hotspots, join the network, and then put them out there. So it's really easy for these things to spread coverage where they need to be because it's permissionless. Anybody can come and join.
00:04:04.400 - 00:04:09.760, Speaker A: How does the helium network know where the coverage lies and where the coverage gaps are?
00:04:09.952 - 00:04:39.084, Speaker B: When you onboard a hotspot to the network, you have to do what's called a location assertion. You tell the network where your hotspot is. Now, of course, we've also learned that you can't trust people to actually tell you where they are. But the cool thing is, since we have hotspots everywhere, you can actually see which other hotspots that it pinged off of, and you can do some analytics on that data and figure out whether or not that hotspot actually is where it says it is.
00:04:39.244 - 00:04:50.556, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really cool. Being able to validate that users do actually exist in certain locations and are able to provide that coverage, I guess, is really important for such a decentralized network like helium.
00:04:50.700 - 00:05:26.504, Speaker B: Yeah. There's also mappers which are really cool. And those are coming. I think they already exist with the IoT Loron network and they are coming with 5G. But the idea is people also get rewarded for effectively cruising around with their gps on while pinging all the hotspots near them. And so they're mapping out where the coverage is and they get rewarded for that. And then the hotspots get rewarded for obviously providing coverage in areas because sometimes you can't just figure out based on location where coverage is going to be because there might be a mountain or something in the way.
00:05:26.504 - 00:05:31.966, Speaker B: So it's really cool to have people driving around and actively mapping out where the coverage is.
00:05:32.150 - 00:05:52.572, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess that makes a lot of sense and is important to also know about the network. So let's shift gears a little bit and talk specifically about helium and solana. So, like we talked about, at the top, there's the great migration of helium to Solana. Why is the helium blockchain shifting into using Solana as the base chain for the network?
00:05:52.758 - 00:06:28.902, Speaker B: When helium first started delving into blockchain and they were like, okay, let's use token incentives to build out our network, there really weren't that many options. It was basically just ETH. And they correctly assumed that ETH was going to get way too expensive to be running the transaction volume that they needed to run at that point. They went and built their own blockchain. And this obviously predates me. This blockchain works, but, like, it's not nearly as full featured as Solana, right? Like, it doesn't support smart contracts or anything like that. It's very, very purpose built to the helium network.
00:06:28.902 - 00:07:25.674, Speaker B: Now, add to that that up until recently, that blockchain was running all of the calculations for proof of coverage and how you actually go and reward the hotspots. Now, helium now has about a million hotspots total. It's closing in on that, and I think around 400,000 of them are active. That got to hit scaling issues with the blockchain trying to calculate all of those things, helium moved to having an oracle based proof of coverage and reward system so that number crunching can happen efficiently. But once you do that, there's really no point in having your own blockchain when there are now options like Solana that are so much cheaper, so much faster, and generally just more composable. Helium people have to write custom code to go interact with the helium L1. But with Solana, exchange support is basically there out of the gate.
00:07:25.674 - 00:07:51.758, Speaker B: Defi support is there. We can spin up an orca pool. There's so many options once you're on Solana that there's really no reason to continue to be running that l one. And as Solana Labs knows, running an l one is hard. There are bugs, things go offline. So this migration also represents shedding a lot of tech debt that we don't necessarily need to have anymore.
00:07:51.926 - 00:08:19.444, Speaker A: Yeah, that's all good cases from an engineering standpoint, that I can easily imagine how difficult it is to run your own task specific layer. One vice using a more general purpose one, makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So I guess, like, once helium completes the migration to Solana, aside from the speed and efficiency of Solana and the general Solana ecosystem, what other benefits is the helium network going to get from it and the. And the users of the helium network?
00:08:20.264 - 00:09:01.496, Speaker B: I think anybody who's, like, use Solana for the first time from another chain can kind of tell you that, like, the user experience is just. The improvement is massive. Like, when you go and click that first transaction and. And you see, like, instead of a loading bar, it's just a little spinner and then it goes through. That's what we're getting. And so we've been testing all these applications and using them on Solana, and it's just so much faster and better for users in general. But on top of that, there's now kind of a flurry of building that's happening that maybe couldn't happen before because people are going to build tools on top of our smart contracts and all the data that we're outputting.
00:09:01.496 - 00:09:29.594, Speaker B: So it's kind of cool to see all these. I don't know, the composition happening. I think Hivemapper uses helium to verify locations on things, but then you've got render that's now coming to Solana. And how much of the contracts that we wrote for helium can be shared with render? I'm not sure, but it might be interesting if you start to see a base layer for DPin building out on Solana.
00:09:29.894 - 00:10:04.924, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be really cool just to see how these two different but similar ecosystems are going to combine into one. And the overall network boost, that's going to happen from that. On the same note of network boost, some people have said that the helium migration to Solana could potentially cause a lot of congestion on the network, especially with the initial migration of trying to move more or less the entire state of an entire separate blockchain onto the Solana blockchain. How is. How is your team and the helium foundation kind of tackling that problem.
00:10:05.344 - 00:11:02.026, Speaker B: Yeah, this one's actually a funny question because I hear it both ways. So one way I'll hear this question is like, oh, like, what's going to be the TPS increase from helium? Like, are we going to see 2000 more TPS from helium? So we can go like, shout to the world that Solana has a ton of transactions. And then on the other side I hear people that are like, wait a second, is this going to put too much congestion on the network? Now, I come from the side of, I don't really care about shouting TPS as a metric, especially if it's spam transactions. I want the transactions that are going through to be meaningful transactions that people actually need to use. The entire helium migration was designed from the ground up to minimize the amount of spam transactions. So sorry to disappoint the people that want to shout from the heavens that there's a ton more transactions coming through. But we didn't design it that way.
00:11:02.026 - 00:11:41.294, Speaker B: Everything that can be, quote, lazy is lazy. So a good example of this is hotspots on the old helium l one. Your hotspots had rewards basically sent straight to your wallet, I think on an hourly basis. Now, if we were to do that on Solana, you say 500,000 transactions, and you're sending that an hourly basis. Now we're sending 500,000 transactions every hour. But what good does that really do anybody? You weren't planning on using those tokens right away. Instead, it makes sense to have tokens accumulate in the oracle on a hotspot.
00:11:41.294 - 00:12:26.728, Speaker B: And then when users want to use those tokens, they can then go and claim them and they kind of materialize onto the blockchain. And so likewise, the migration itself is also lazy. It doesn't happen until a user opens their wallet. And when a user opens their wallet, it hits a permissionless endpoint that then goes, we're calling it seeds the wallet, but it basically takes their wallet state and inflates it from a merkle tree that we've, or Merkel root that we've written to the chain, which I don't want to get into technical gibberish area, but it's, you know, basically allows you to get the state that you had when the helium blockchain shut off by putting in your wallet and sending a few transactions.
00:12:26.896 - 00:13:13.400, Speaker A: Wow, that's super cool. So, like, let me make sure I understand this. So you're taking once helium, like, once the great migration actually happens, the helium foundation is going to take a snapshot of the entire state of the helium network, and a relatively small amount of data is going to be transferred immediately to the Solana blockchain in the form of this route, which is very similar to how state compression works on Solana. It's effectively compressing all of this data. So that way any user can then go at any point in the future, whenever they need their tokens actually minted on the Solana blockchain. They can go to the Solana blockchain, they can particularly. Or they can specifically mint their own tokens for their own wallets, and then they can just carry on smartly from there.
00:13:13.400 - 00:13:16.044, Speaker A: Is that the summation of it?
00:13:16.424 - 00:13:50.644, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think of it less of minting tokens, because we're really just taking over the state that already existed. So all it's doing is allowing you to go and plug your wallet in, and it returns a bunch of transactions that, mind you, anybody can run these transactions, because we've taken the position that this is the state of the world, this is how we want the world to look. We're just not going to run 800,000 transactions at once, because we only have 24 hours of downtime, and that could be enough, but I don't want to risk that.
00:13:51.184 - 00:13:52.124, Speaker A: Fair enough.
00:13:52.704 - 00:14:20.710, Speaker B: All it's doing is giving you the transactions to run this contract is actually really cool. I think a lot of people, I'll probably do a twitter thread on it at some point, but I think a lot of people can use this for other migration esque things, or even airdrops, because you often see things where people need to run 10,000 transactions, and it's like, how do I guarantee that each one of these runs exactly once, not this one ran three times, and this one didn't run at all.
00:14:20.902 - 00:14:47.682, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I'm sure any more information that you or the team publishes will be greatly, greatly loved by the Solana ecosystem as a whole. I guess we'll go ahead and wrap up quickly with two final questions of why should everyday users really care about this migration from the helium blockchain to the Solana blockchain? And then similarly, why should businesses care?
00:14:47.858 - 00:15:39.552, Speaker B: Everyday users of helium will care because they're getting probably a lot more stability out of this, because the helium L1 has had its issues, but it also enables us to innovate a lot faster. We were able to build this entire migration in about six months, and it includes things that weren't on the helium L1, like our entire subtal infrastructure. So it's really, really exciting if you're a helium user. If you're a Solana user, it's exciting because I think you're going to see a bunch of cool tools that start to leverage the helium network. So one that was recently in the hackathon is this one called Heliport, and it's actually using helium LoRaWAN hotspots to send transactions when there's not enough signal to send a transaction over a normal network, which is kind of cool from a payments perspective.
00:15:39.728 - 00:15:44.864, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks for all the information about the helium migration, NOAA, and thanks for joining, everybody.
