00:00:18.240 - 00:00:45.172, Speaker A: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for coming out. Breakpoint, day two. So thanks, Austin, for the introduction. I wanted to go over the state of stake. So Solana being a proof of stake network, the whole infrastructure is really secured by staking in consensus. So where does that leave us today? Some high level overview on staking.
00:00:45.172 - 00:01:55.434, Speaker A: Now, this is staking for consensus, not to be confused with staking for various defi protocols and yield farming and things like that. The majority, 78% of all Sol on the Solana network, is currently staked to the various validators. 396 million sol. The total value, as of a couple days ago, $99 billion locked up in stake accounts on the Solana network, over 380,000 stake accounts. Where are these stake accounts? So, stake is delegated to validators, and we have an incredible distribution of validators all over the world. As of this writing, we had 1158 validators running in 197 data centers on 111 autonomous systems in 32 countries all around the world. So as far as the physical distribution, the Solana network has really great penetration and spread around the world, and really looking forward to this, just continuing to grow as more nodes come online and join the network and help secure the Solana network and receive stake.
00:01:55.434 - 00:03:24.214, Speaker A: So of these 1100 validators that are running around the network, their voting power, their power to control and influence the network, is a factor of how much stake is delegated to each validator. So the question is not just how are the validators distributed around the network and around the world, but how is the delegation of stake distributed? So stake distribution on Solana and on many proof of stake networks is a big challenge. So, of all of the 1100 validators that are running on Solana, there is a cumulative stake greater than 33% of all stake on the network, on the 19 largest validators on the network. So that means that the remaining 1140 validators have more of a minority share, if you will. So the difference between validator distribution and stake distribution is one of different incentives and something that's really worth the discussion here that we're going to have in a few minutes. So why do we care that stake should be distributed amongst multiple validators? It's really for censorship, resistance. This is the fundamental security of the Solana network that can keep the network decentralized and secure for everyone in the world to be able to access Solana.
00:03:24.214 - 00:04:49.864, Speaker A: So the two primary goals here that can often act with opposite incentives is how can we increase the number of validators on the network that are of good distribution and spread around the, around the world across different geographies? Different legislative districts, autonomous systems, ISP's, anything that can really physically distribute the physical infrastructure, the RPC nodes, the validators that are running the Solana network. And how can we increase the distribution of stake across all of these validators so that there is a more balanced or equitable power in voting and block production? So there's two different sets of incentives that drive both of these factors. What the validators can choose to run a node anywhere they want. People have different incentives for choosing to join the Solana network to run a validator. Stake delegations are at the discretion of the token holders, the people who have purchased Sol or received Sol over time, and choose to delegate this to validators. There's different incentives for each of these different population groups and the alignment of these two different groups of incentives. How can we align the incentives to create the most decentralized and secure Solana network possible? Enter stake pools.
00:04:49.864 - 00:06:15.964, Speaker A: Stake pools are an on chain program which allows liquid staking and dynamic delegation distributions. My position is that stake pools offer really the best vehicle forward into the future of consensus staking to align the incentives between sustainable validator growth and equitable stake distribution for all of the high quality operators around the network. So in a stake pool or a liquid staking solution, and we have representatives from two different stake pools on Solana here. We're going to have a chat in a few minutes. Anyone who holds Sol as a depositor can simply deposit their tokens into a stake pool or into one of these liquid staking solutions and receive a derivative token representing their stake position. Stake pools can then delegate this sole that's collected in the on chain contract to any number of validators according to any unique delegation strategy or validator inclusion strategy that the state stake pool wants to set up. Why is this a good thing? Why do we care? So, for validators, if a validator knows that they are going to be included, or are potentially eligible to be included in a stake pool, this gives them some degree of confidence or probability that they will be able to receive a certain amount of delegations.
00:06:15.964 - 00:07:36.366, Speaker A: A lot of smaller validators want to join the Solana network and want to know that they'll be able to receive delegations from third parties. As this is one to one tied with the validators revenue stream, they get voting rewards based on how much stake is delegated to their node. If a validator wants to run on the network and is not sure if they're going to receive any delegations, they may not be able to know if they're going to break even or not. And so by knowing or having some predictable path to victory for newer validators to say, if I can join the network and I can become eligible for stake pool a, or stake pool b, or both, or a conglomerate of stake pools, then this really provides a path to sort of predictable returns and an incentive for more validators to join the network. For token holders, why would someone want to participate and deposit their soul into a stake pool? In addition to receiving staking yields, a lot of stake pools have integrations into DeFi or other apps and dapps that are launched on Solana. So this unlocks additional use cases for the derivative token that represents someone's position in a stake pool. Additionally, for anyone who's ever manually staked to a validator, or perhaps staked to multiple validators to spread your stake around, there is some overhead time.
00:07:36.366 - 00:08:17.824, Speaker A: There's a cool down period. If you want to move a stake account from validator a to validator b, and it's a bit of a high friction experience. It's not really the most user friendly. Stake pools simply offer a really clean user flow, deposit Sol into a smart contract, receive a derivative token back, and the stake pool manager. The stake pool program takes care of delegating the stake to whichever validators are included in their strategy. How is this good for the network? We've got multiple different stake pools that are live on Solana today. I've got two of them here, reps for two of them, and they have different staking strategies.
00:08:17.824 - 00:09:47.822, Speaker A: I think a lot of different pools can unlock or kind of reveal community values or what people care about on the network as far as the returns, as far as where the stake is distributed. And I think a lot of this overlap and the divergence between the delegation strategies can really provide for a diverse and competitive and meritocratic landscape for validator growth, which overall will be better for the diversity and the stability of the Solana network. So, to summarize, what's a stake pool gonna do for us? It's gonna help us spread more stake to more validators while returning the same yields, if not potentially higher, through defi integrations to our users. This, in turn, means a more censorship and censorship resistant and decentralized Solana network, which is a better and more secure Solana future for all of us active today. There are four stake pools that are community run, and the Solana foundation is also in the process of bootstrapping a significantly sized stake pool as well. Marinade finance and Lino are here with us today, both running community pools and Sosin and Jpool are also live today and are working, I believe, on various defi integrations. So with that, I'm going to switch the conversation over and the three of us are going to have a chat.
00:09:47.822 - 00:10:01.412, Speaker A: I have with me Brian Crane from Chorus one, who is representing the lido stake pool, and Michael ripetny from Marinade Finance. So thanks, guys, for joining me.
00:10:01.518 - 00:10:02.924, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:10:06.704 - 00:10:44.556, Speaker A: So I guess I'd like to start with, if you guys wouldn't mind, kind of giving a brief introduction to each of the stake pools. I know Lido and Marinade take a bit of a different approach to how they choose validators to include in their stake pool and how they do the delegation strategy. And I was wondering if you, and we'll start with you, Brian, if you could just kind of give me an overview of what Lido is and how they choose to spread the stake or stake to the validators that are chosen and why you think this is kind of in the best interest of the network.
00:10:44.740 - 00:11:04.348, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, yeah, it's great being here. So, yeah. My name is Brian Prain. I've been active in the Solana space since, since the beginning. So running course one, which is at the moment the largest validator. And we have been thinking about liquid staking for a long time.
00:11:04.348 - 00:11:35.604, Speaker B: So we were working also previously on liquid staking for Cosmos. We did early work on that, and I think a big idea around liquid staking and the role of liquid staking was also around preventing stake to accumulate with exchanges. Right. So that. And now with Lido. Right. So Lido started on ethereum, and it's at the moment the biggest liquid staking solution on Ethereum.
00:11:35.604 - 00:13:20.864, Speaker B: And the way Lido works right now on Solana as well is that, you know, there's basically a selection process for validators, and the selection process included a bunch of the kind of highest quality validators on Solana, and those were ones that have substantial stake and also ones that did not. So there were also ones that were not at all Solana validators, but they had very good knowledge and hardware. And so I think on Lido side, there's definitely in this initial phase, right, this emphasis on, you know, high quality and vetting, and then, yeah, they were like, added to that and they get delegations from the, you know, the Lido smart contract and, yeah, and at the moment, there's like 15 validators with a uniform distribution among them. And, yeah, also with, with the plan of, like, increasing that in the future, I think in the end, the Lido mission is to make staking simple so that the user experience is easy and smooth and decentralized. And so I think that's basically the thing that Lido's been working on in Ethereum, I think has had a very big impact in decentralizing staking on Ethereum and moving, making kind of this decentralized approach, staking with many validators kind of the preferred option over staking through exchanges and. Yeah, and now we're basically working on the same thing for Solana.
00:13:21.164 - 00:13:35.624, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. Michael, would you care to introduce marinade? I know, I'll just say I know Marinade was the first community staking pool launched on Solana and is also a Solana native stake pool as well.
00:13:36.594 - 00:14:18.588, Speaker C: Right? Yeah. So, like, back in February where Marinate started, we were actually thinking about, like, three main objectives. I would say that would be to take Solana as it was, and bring the best user experience to Solana, make it capital efficient and composable, and three, to make it, like, more secure and decentralized. So that's how it all started, actually, back then. And back then, it was always only eleven validator nodes were having this, 33% of total cells staked, so that was enough to hold the network. Only eleven nodes. So we wanted to do something about it, and that's how we started marinate back then.
00:14:18.588 - 00:15:03.638, Speaker C: And so the strategy behind it is that we don't have a selection process. We have an open end, transparent formula that anybody can come and see and anybody can spin up their own validator. And as long as they meet the criteria, they get the stake from marinade. So what we're trying to do to make it more decentralized, more robust, and sensor persistent is that we are skipping, actually this, 33% of those today, 19 biggest validators. We are skipping all of them, and they don't get any stake from marinade. And we delegate the, the sole state to the rest, like, spread the network and make it more evenly, make it more decentralized, more robust. So, yeah, that, I would say, is the idea.
00:15:03.638 - 00:15:26.084, Speaker C: And when we introduce marinade, like, in general, we're saying that it is a community driven project because we didn't raise any money on it. So there is no vc in it. There was no public sale, no private sale. So it just opened up with community and to build together with community to make Solana fundamentally better. So that was the idea behind Marinade.
00:15:26.584 - 00:15:35.176, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. And could you, Michael, just expand really briefly on the size of the marinade stake pool today and the number of validators, you guys are staking to.
00:15:35.320 - 00:15:50.240, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good one. So today we are staking to more than 400 validators, actually. So we're really trying to spread the stake around. And we're having more than 7 million souls staked at marinade. It's been live for three months now, but, yeah, so we've seen a massive growth in here.
00:15:50.432 - 00:16:22.304, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you both. I want to ask about the applications that like, what can users do after they deposit and they decide they want to participate in Lido or they want to participate in marinade? We've seen a number of projects start to integrate the token that one gets the lido tokens or the MSOL tokens or St soldiers in the case of lido, rather, what can users do if someone wants to contribute in your stake pool? What can they do in addition to simply holding that position? Brian? Sure.
00:16:22.344 - 00:16:55.968, Speaker B: Yeah, so, yeah, I mean, so there are a whole bunch of different things that one could do and a lot of new things that are coming up. So one thing is you can put them, and I think that's maybe the most frequent usage. You can put it in some of the amms. So there's different pools that you can put them into. Pool like, you know, stake SOl pool. There are, you know, there's also a pool that has staked ether. So basically, if you're staking ether, right, you can get the staked ether and lighter there.
00:16:55.968 - 00:17:25.564, Speaker B: You can put that together with stake Sol into a pool. So then you're earning kind of ether and sol staking rewards. So I think those are like, the amms is a big thing, of course, besides, you know, the. And this is the same for the same for marinate, right. But like, basically you're earning the trading fees, right. You're earning the sole staking rewards. You often also earn some like native token off that basically decentralized exchange as well as lido.
00:17:25.564 - 00:17:49.088, Speaker B: Right. So the LDO governance token for the system. So you earn that as well. So those are the, I would say currently the most use ones. We are also building anchor integration. So for some. So anchor is basically kind of a lending protocol, a deposit lending protocol on terra.
00:17:49.088 - 00:18:10.754, Speaker B: So you'll be able to put your stake Sol in there and then borrow basically ust. So Us dollar stablecoin against that. So yeah, that's another. And then, yeah, I think definitely lending is in the medium term. It's going to be like very cool and very important. Yeah, cool.
00:18:11.054 - 00:18:32.974, Speaker A: And how do you view the community of people who deposit? Right. You said someone can deposit and they get these lido tokens, what can one do with Lido token? And really, like, at what level of decision making or selection criteria do you feel that, you know, there's, there is, is, or should be or will be kind of community engagement or the Lido token holders?
00:18:33.094 - 00:19:13.236, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean, Lido is a dao, right? And there's governance, which is on ethereum. Right? So it's kind of like a DAo that's encompassing multiple, different staking protocols on multiple chains, you know, including Lidar Solana. And you can participate in the governance votes. There are lots of different governance votes on, for example, how LDO rewards are deployed, different things that are funded, community efforts are being funded, expansion to new chains. So, yeah, lots of different ways that one can basically participate and contribute to that.
00:19:13.340 - 00:20:01.272, Speaker A: Great. Cool. Michael, a question for you. Given that marinade is staking to so many different validators, there's been an argument made that advocating for a stake pool to distribute to hundreds of validators or every validator on the network, or be available to every validator on the network really commoditizes the value that a validator brings to the network. Whereas we know there are some validators and some operators that really have done a lot more to contribute to the community than others who might simply just be running their node in silence. And I'm kind of wondering how you view that argument of commoditization, if you will, in the light of something that could spread stake to so many different nodes.
00:20:01.408 - 00:20:49.120, Speaker C: Yeah, so I would say there are two answers to that. One is what marinate does for the validators is that it abstracts all the marketing activities and the community engagement. Like marinate gets them the source so they can really focus on what matters for them is to keep the validator going and going in the right way, so they can just focus on like operating the node and that's it. And then they get staked from marinade. So that's one part that we are like abstracting from them. And then to like the, to the commutatized, I would say that marinate the way it is built, like without, again, like any vc behind it. What we plan to do is to make it like open, open kitchen for everybody to come and build with marinade.
00:20:49.120 - 00:21:22.254, Speaker C: So the validators should care about like being in Adele and we like value them to be part of this discussion in Marinade so that we all can together say how it's going to be, how the sale is going to be staked. They could alter the delegation strategy. So I don't really think that it's going to be this way. It might be that we get all of them and trying to these activities they are doing just by themselves at the moment as like a solo validators. We are trying to get them around one table and to solve this problem collectively with all the brains, but put them in one place.
00:21:23.194 - 00:22:21.676, Speaker A: Great. As we are seeing stake pools continue to grow, I am wondering what your thoughts, and I will ask this to both of you, what your thoughts are on the different staking criteria. Different stake pools, say Lido, Marinade and others, might ultimately end up with overlapping stake criteria, overlapping delegation distributions in some aspects and perhaps divergent distributions in other aspects. Do you feel that if there becomes this sort of mass of stability or massive tokens that are spread out amongst different stake pools, but are 90, 95% staked in a similar way with similar weightings, is this a good thing for the network or is this a challenge for the network? Is this a convergence of values or is this some sort of centralization maneuvering? Curious.
00:22:21.860 - 00:22:54.924, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think both Marinade and Lido already with like, actually, I mean, if you look at normal Solana delegators, right? Who here stakes, like, probably most of them stake with one validator, two or three or something like that. So if they're staking with either solution. Right. They are already spreading their stake a lot more than normal. And I don't think it is an issue if there's like, you know, overlap between validator sets. Right. Because in the end, like, I mean, such a big distribution.
00:22:54.924 - 00:23:29.404, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think that matters too much. I think it is great. Definitely, if there's a diversity of different stake pools, stake approaches, of course there's a challenge there, which is that liquidity matters a lot of these tokens. So it's hard to have 100 stake pools that have any traction. I think in the end it's probably going to be like a pretty small number. And so I think it's important that like the state pools that exist are also like very inclusive and have like white. Yeah.
00:23:30.304 - 00:23:36.688, Speaker A: Okay. Are there plans in the lido pool to expand the validator set to be more inclusive?
00:23:36.776 - 00:23:43.656, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, no, definitely. There's plans to increase the validator set for sure. Yeah.
00:23:43.800 - 00:23:44.884, Speaker A: Okay, great.
00:23:45.944 - 00:24:31.424, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, I would say that it's actually funny because now these days we are not even going head to head with Lido since the delegation strategy is quite the opposite for all those projects. But I like it that really the strategies for us is to spread the stake, the strategies for somebody else might be to go with the top validator nodes out there, probably. So I like the diversity as being said in here, and I think it's a good way, even for the ecosystem. But in the long run, we believe that the power law is going to kick in and there are not going to be probably like multiple stake pools out there. It's going to be probably that one dominant player will be like having the place for themselves.
00:24:32.844 - 00:25:31.334, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. So in, say, the, I don't know, optimistic scenario, and the majority of stake is staked through stake pools, whether it's lido, marinade, or some conglomerate. There's been some discussion that this really takes the onus away from the delegator. The actual token holder delegates to a validator, and that validator sort of receives the trust of getting that delegation from that individual person. And so in this sort of more direct staking maneuver, right, in the pre stake pool days, it was really up to the individual delegators to stake in a way that was good for the network. And as we've seen, most individual token holders or investors, there's not really a great way for them to know or differentiate between one validator or another or 100 validators.
00:25:31.334 - 00:26:13.552, Speaker A: How do they pick? How do they choose? What does it really matter? But even in that environment, the onus was still on the token holders to ultimately secure the Solana network. And in this scenario, it really shifts the responsibility to the operator of the stake pool who's making the delegation decision. So the distribution of stake is really one step further removed from the token holders who are really bought in and invested in the network. And I'm wondering, is this a good thing? Is this a bad thing? Is it neutral? Michael, I'd like to start with you.
00:26:13.688 - 00:26:55.260, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So a quick note on that, like why we started back in time with eleven validator notes. So I don't think that it was that the people would like to pick a validator and meeting some criteria. It was because they were just presented with the top ten validators and they just take their soul on one validator and it was like a set and forget setup for them. And so, like before that was before it was marinade or lido. Now, like these days, I would say that the delegation strategy run by marinade, for example, is that it actually checks if the validator is still performing. If not, it could like automatically rebalance stake for you.
00:26:55.260 - 00:27:14.620, Speaker C: So it's still set and forget, but now it's, it's a better way than it was before, when it was like super convenient and easy just to pick one and leave it be. So I really believe that the, you know, the delegation strategy behind it of a stake pool such as marinade is improving. Is improving. Yeah.
00:27:14.772 - 00:27:17.304, Speaker A: Great. Any thoughts, Brian?
00:27:19.204 - 00:27:44.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it is. It is, of course, like a trade off there, right? Because I think a lot of. I think one, there is also, like, a great thing of, like, individual token holders, like, having the direct relationship. Right. With a validator. At the same time. You know, I think what Michael was saying was true, right.
00:27:44.454 - 00:28:36.746, Speaker B: That, like, it's, if you think of, like, oh, there's so many validators, there's just no way that people can actually then select from outside of, like, the best known ones. So I think from that perspective, liquid staking solutions are great and important in, like, yeah, like, kind of distributing that, I think it will be important to still kind of consider contributions and to what extent validators like helping the network and supporting it. These are things that you can necessarily measure with on chain things. And so I think, yeah, it would be great to sort of for that also to be, like, a way that stake is being distributed by the network, you know, to take sort of into account, like, how much are these different entities driving Solana forward and helping the network?
00:28:36.890 - 00:28:56.324, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. Well, we just have a brief minute left. I just wanted to ask kind of for final question, like, what do you see as the future of stake pools? Or what does a user have to look forward to who might be considering, say, depositing into Lido or marinade or launching their own stake pool? Michael, do you want to start?
00:28:56.484 - 00:29:45.240, Speaker C: Yeah. So the idea again about Marinade was to make the liquid staking fully democratic. So it would be up to the community who's in it and who's using marinade to decide what's next and like, to build it all together. So I really believe that if we want to make it right, we should bet on, like, security, utility, and community that those would be the three interesting parts where we need to double down to make the stake pools or, yeah, stakeholders in general, right. To make it the right way, to be driven by community to have it the most secure out there. And so that the token, the derivative token, that amsoil should be, like, utilized just everywhere so that it doesn't really matter. That's the end game, right? That MSOL should be like the unit of account in Solana ecosystem and not the plains Sol.
00:29:45.240 - 00:30:02.084, Speaker C: So if you can just use MSOL everywhere in the DeFi, if you can use it in lending protocol, if you can put it into liquidity pool. If you can trade it on FTX, it doesn't really matter to hold Sol anymore because having a stake token is better for the network. So. Yeah, that's what I'm looking. Looking forward to.
00:30:02.204 - 00:30:09.024, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, we'll wrap it up there. Thank you both for your time and thanks, everybody, for attending.
00:30:09.364 - 00:30:09.724, Speaker C: Thank you.
