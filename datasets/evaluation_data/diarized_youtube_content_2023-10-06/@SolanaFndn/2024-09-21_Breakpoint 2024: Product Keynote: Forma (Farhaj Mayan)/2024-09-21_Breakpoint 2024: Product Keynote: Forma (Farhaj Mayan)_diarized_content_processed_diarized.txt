00:00:11.640 - 00:00:35.177, Speaker A: Hey everyone, my name is Farhaj. I'm the co founder of Forma. We're developing Salon Economic Zones. Basically we work with techno optimistic countries and governments to collaborate with them and find different ways how we can actually connect their nation's economy to the Solana economy. To drive economic development and lift people out of poverty. Here's how it works. I'm sure a lot of you saw Balaji and Raj's talk yesterday.
00:00:35.177 - 00:01:11.875, Speaker A: They talk about doing popups, which is basically a long term gathering where a lot of people get together to discuss how they can start to work on a lot of interesting things. So with us we were like the first version of a Salon Economic Zone. Could just be a pop up zone where we get a lot of people locally, internationally to come together and discuss a lot of key topics and start to actually drive economic development. After that we go on to build programs, policies and products. We call them Salon Economic Programs. Once that's done, after the pop up zone and the programs are successful, we work with local communities to build physical hubs. So there's a long term Solana stronghold within these countries.
00:01:11.875 - 00:02:08.975, Speaker A: This was our first Solana Economic Zone. We just wrapped it up in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was an amazing experience and we actually built a two story campus where a lot of people came as a third place to come discuss and build on Solana. Anyway, I like to show Vertel, so here's a video to show you what it looked like. Pretty cool, right? I'm going to get straight into it. Thank you. Thank you.
00:02:08.975 - 00:02:39.937, Speaker A: So we went from zero to building that campus and getting over 500 people to apply, 244 accepted residents, over 100 projects from the salon ecosystem and local ecosystem to be represented. With over 161 month long residents and a lot of people. So the 80 weekly residents are 80 times four. Right. So we had a lot of people come through the zone, get Solana pilled for the first time, start to contribute to Solana for the first time. It's really incredible. But what we didn't expect was the amount of participation and representation we got from locals.
00:02:39.937 - 00:03:24.799, Speaker A: Over 62% of the people who attended were Argentinian. And for a country that hadn't really interacted with Solana before, it felt like we made a huge impact on our way out. And here's what this looks like. So if we think about Formans as a network state, our audience has spread all over the world and people flew in, you know, within two months notice to come and think about the future of Solana within Argentina. And here's our economic impact, here's how we measure success. You know, we think a lot about terms that governments are really familiar with, foreign direct investment, direct domestic direct investment, which is FDI and ddi. And so within the short span of the time we were there, we had over half a million dollars of direct investment come by virtual forma and the people were visiting, investing in everything from tourism to food and beverage to investing in local companies making hires.
00:03:24.799 - 00:04:05.269, Speaker A: It was really, really incredible to see. We also had over 2 million social media impressions talking about Argentina on a global stage, about how it's an amazing place for people to come and build. We also upscaled 500, over 500 local talent, helping them understand how to build their future on the Solana ecosystem. But most importantly, we had over 80 B2B and B2G introductions that we made for companies that were there in Argentina. So what's next? The zone is over, but the future of Argentina is still really strong. And the opportunity for Solana is even bigger. We're already working with some local government counterparts to think about a new talent visa to make it easier for people from other countries to come and set up or be a digital nomad as crypto talent in Argentina.
00:04:05.269 - 00:04:43.475, Speaker A: We're already working on education programs to get more people to start building on Solana for the first time. This is really, really cool, but in the time that we were there, we built a really good relationship with a company that's allowing us to enable Solana USDT payment at over 2000 small businesses in Argentina. And that goes live next week. So this is really, really cool. Now across the entire Buenos Aires metroplex, from a cafe to a bar to a restaurant, you can pay in Solana usdt and that wouldn't have happened if our community didn't come down there. And finally we found a lot of amazing community leaders that we're going to be supporting to build long term Solana communities in Argentina. So it stays an active and really engaging market.
00:04:43.475 - 00:05:23.427, Speaker A: This is also really cool. One of the artists who was there in Argentina actually ended up talking to the TV station and getting sanctioned for mural that they built where they represented and painted amazing, amazing Solana art projects and NFT collections. So that's going to live there forever. In the heart of Palermo Hollywood, which is a thriving neighborhood in Buenos Aires. Finally, Argentina was just our first step. We're really, really interested in progressive governments and cities who are trying to attract the best of the best on Solana and trying to upskill their own local talent. So if you're a government, if you're working in the innovation department of a city, or if you're a foundation who's interested in understanding how you can expand and activate local economies, please reach out to us.
00:05:23.427 - 00:05:36.543, Speaker A: We'd love to collaborate. That's all for now. I'm Far Hadj. I'm here with my co founder, Babak. You can find us anywhere. You can follow us formercity on Twitter, and I guess it's called X now. But we really appreciate your time and we'd love to see all of you at the next Salon Economic Zone.
00:05:36.543 - 00:05:36.895, Speaker A: Thank you.
