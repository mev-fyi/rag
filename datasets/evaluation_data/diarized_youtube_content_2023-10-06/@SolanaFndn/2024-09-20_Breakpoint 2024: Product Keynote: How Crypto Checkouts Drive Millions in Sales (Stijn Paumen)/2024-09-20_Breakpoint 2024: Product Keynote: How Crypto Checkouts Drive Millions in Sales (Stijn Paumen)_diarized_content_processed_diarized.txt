00:00:08.640 - 00:00:33.135, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Super great to be here. So I'm Stein, the CEO and founder of Helio. Crucially, not to be confused with either Helium or Helios. That's a very common mistake in this ecosystem. So we want to show you something new that we've been working on. It's going to help our merchants customers use crypto checkouts in new, innovative ways to drive millions in sales.
00:00:33.135 - 00:01:37.407, Speaker A: So when Jim and I started Helio two years ago, our main goal was to deliver crypto checkouts to the masses. And since then, we've onboarded 6,000 creators, merchants and developers that use Helio to sell digital goods, subscriptions, e Commerce to over 750,000 unique buyers. We've grown our payment volume from near zero to over a billion on an annualized basis. All right, so when we started, the main drivers behind the pay with crypto narrative were still Bitcoin and Ethereum. We launched with a Solana first strategy because it makes sense to use the cheapest and fastest rails for payments. However, on our journey, we've learned something that's even more important. The number one reason why merchants choose Hideo and Solana is because they want to reach new customers and new communities.
00:01:37.407 - 00:02:22.035, Speaker A: Yes, they love speed, yes, they love low cost, but they like selling more, even more. And that's really the killer feature of checkouts on Solana. And that's now becoming a very large opportunity indeed. So as decentralized wealth grows and we have tens of millions of users with digital currency in their wallets, they're going to want to spend some of that. And that's the crypto commerce market opportunity, which is 8 billion today, growing to 30 billion over the next few years. And that's the opportunity that we unlock for our merchant customers. We help them reach those digital dollars with seamless on chain checkout solutions.
00:02:22.035 - 00:03:44.637, Speaker A: And we do that through Helio branded pay links and checkouts. Can you put your hand up if you've ever paid on a Helio pay link or a checkout, about one third of you. So we see that as a really, really easy way for people to spin up a payment and instantly accept USDC or hundreds of other currencies. And then we also offer fully integrated white label checkout solutions, integration into Discord for selling memberships, integration into YouTube for paywalling, DEX screener, Magic Eden integration, and of course, the Solana Pay plugin for Shopify. Over the past year, we've helped hundreds of Shopify brands reach new customers, new communities, and we've seen over 75 million in real sales through the Solana Pay plugin, web two brands like Brian Johnson's Health Regime or of course hardware products like Hivemapper, Keystone Helium and of course, Solana Mobile. Today we're taking that one step further and we're allowing our Shopify brands customers to sell directly from the virtual town square. Today we're introducing Blinks for Shopify.
00:03:44.637 - 00:04:57.455, Speaker A: Let's take a look. Sa let's go. Can I have a round of applause for that? The team did an amazing job. I think so. Can't wait to get this into the hands of our customers. Starting next week. We've also extended our suite of Web3 features for customer loyalty.
00:04:57.455 - 00:05:44.257, Speaker A: We've seen the Seeker announcement yesterday. With a single click in the Helio dashboard, you can now offer a discount for your product or service to any seeker holder. So that's a group of 200,000 crypto fluent customers that you can reach at the click of a button. You can also include airdrops in your purchase like non fungible or fungible tokens. And also if you have your own token, you can deliver ultimate utility by enabling it as a method of payment in Shopify. I think this is another great step towards our mission of making crypto payments accessible to everyone. Thank you for joining us today and please come and see us at booth number B7 to learn more.
00:05:44.257 - 00:05:44.785, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
