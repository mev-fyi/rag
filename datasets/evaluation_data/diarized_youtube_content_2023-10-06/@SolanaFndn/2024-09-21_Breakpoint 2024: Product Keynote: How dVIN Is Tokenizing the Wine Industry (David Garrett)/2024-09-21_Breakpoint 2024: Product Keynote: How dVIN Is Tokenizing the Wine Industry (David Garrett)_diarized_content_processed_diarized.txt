00:00:08.039 - 00:00:42.593, Speaker A: Everybody, Hi, I'm. I'm Dave Garrett. I'm the co founder of Devin Labs. We are tokenizing the $1 trillion global wine asset class. For the last three years, we've done pilots with more than 70 wineries and we've tokenized about $2 million worth of wine already. Wine isn't just a. Wine isn't just a huge industry, but it's also a decentralized industry.
00:00:42.593 - 00:01:43.879, Speaker A: There's about 30,000 independent little tiny winemakers around the world and about 10 million little tiny independent middlemen. And what that means is that there's no real source of truth for the industry. So by tokenizing wine, you're solving a lot of problems. You're solving an authenticity problem. You're solving anti fraud and anti counterfeit, you're solving chain of custody, you're solving supply chain data, consumption data, and most importantly, you're solving customer acquisition and loyalty. So I could talk to you about how we're doing all of those things, but I only have five minutes, so I'm going to show you. Do we have any mad lads here? Anybody? So yesterday we dropped a champagne NFT for every mad lady.
00:01:43.879 - 00:02:13.797, Speaker A: And what that NFT is is it's a digital twin for a physical bottle of champagne that's right now sitting in Bordeaux City Bond. That bottle has your unique lad right there on the bottle as the label. And there's a Vincoin airdrop attached to that bottle. And starting October 21st, you'll be able to ship that bottle anywhere in the world for free. Damn. Cool. It's the biggest liquid airdrop in history.
00:02:13.797 - 00:02:44.555, Speaker A: But we didn't want to leave you folks out. Okay, so everybody in the room is going to get a chance to earn an airdrop as well. But you have to work for it. Okay, so let me tell you how it's going to work. Back in May, we put 4,000 bottles of champagne on a boat and sent it to Singapore. Now, just so that you know, like, yeah, that's what the bottle looks like. Just so you know, like, we sent the good stuff.
00:02:44.555 - 00:03:03.799, Speaker A: If you don't know, ask around. Like we do the good stuff with the wine. So there's 4,000 bottles of champagne here. And as you leave, you can grab a bottle. But let me show you how to get your airdrop. It's actually really simple. We just unlocked all of the bottles, all of the digital quarks in the bottles about two hours ago.
00:03:03.799 - 00:03:55.741, Speaker A: So the first thing that you do is you tap the NFC sticker, that little gold sticker, that little Gold sticker. You tap that with your phone and that will let you claim the nft. It'll put the NFT for that bottle in your wallet, and then you'll have a digital asset, right? You'll have a digital twin for that bottle of wine. You'll own a real world asset, and then you can put it in your suitcase and take it home. Then when you're ready to drink the wine, you tap the phone, you tap that button again, or you tap the, you tap the NFC tag again. And when you tap it, it'll open our app and it'll open the nft, the digital cork, NFT in the app and you can just hit the open button. And when you open the physical bottle of wine, you're also opening the nft, the digital court.
00:03:55.741 - 00:04:25.279, Speaker A: Now, that's an important moment because something really important happens when you do that. Because you're opening the bottle, we're actually burning the digital asset, right? Because it's no longer an authentic asset. You've opened the bottle, but we're minting you a new token. It's called a tasting token. And that tasting token comes with rewards and status from the winery. And most importantly, in this case, it comes with 2000 Vincoin. Now, this transaction is really important.
00:04:25.279 - 00:05:17.675, Speaker A: That's kind of the heart of what we do, because what's happening there is the winemaker, in this case it's us, is paying you in vincoin in exchange for data. Because when you click open the bottle now, the winemaker knows that that bottle has been consumed, and they know kind of when and in general where that bottle has been consumed. And if you opt in, that winemaker has acquired a new customer, which is very difficult and expensive for the winemaker. So now the winemaker has data about their wines in the world and they've acquired new customers. So it's a really important transaction. And it's a way for, it's a viral way for winemakers to grow their customer base, to acquire new customers, to get really good data. And it's a way for Devin to invite 250 million wine enthusiasts from around the world into the Solana ecosystem.
00:05:17.675 - 00:06:00.095, Speaker A: But wait, but wait, there's more. Because here's the thing, unless you're a professional like me and my team, you really shouldn't drink a whole bottle of champagne by yourself. So when you open that bottle with friends, they can also, once the bottle's open, they can tap that thing and then they get a dating token, and they also get a little bit of vincoin. They get 150 Vincoin themselves and then you get a little taste. So it's a really a great way to get really for winemakers to purchase data from the wine from the consumers. I'm wrapping up now. We went live on Jupiter this morning.
00:06:00.095 - 00:06:17.345, Speaker A: Woo. So Vincoin is available on Jupiter lfg. If you scan the QR code, you can find out more about that. Thank you very much, everybody. Grab your wine on the way out. Don't not grab your wine and then we'll see you at the closing party. Thank you, everybody.
