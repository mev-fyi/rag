00:00:09.200 - 00:00:09.784, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:09.886 - 00:00:48.562, Speaker B: We are live. Welcome, everyone, to the fifth event of the Solana Wormhole Hackathon. We're kind of doing a continuation of our defi discussion on Monday. We recapped the past few months in decentralized finance world, and this panel is going to be about the future. We're going to be talking about how we expect the next few months of decentralized finance to look kind of what the future of governance looks like, layer one versus L2, scaling and everything else these folks get into and they discuss. So I don't really think anyone here needs an introduction. I will let Toli kind of handle quick, quick roundabouts of everyone.
00:00:48.562 - 00:01:18.892, Speaker B: But thank you. Thank you to everyone who attended. And if you want a full list of all of the other upcoming events, visit solana.com hackathon. The panel will last about an hour, and as a reminder, we have a chat section where you all can kind of leave general discussion. And then we have a questions tab. So if you have any questions for the panelists during this chat, leave them in there, and we'll take the last ten minutes, we'll highlight the question, and everyone will take turns answering it.
00:01:18.892 - 00:01:25.664, Speaker B: So I think with that, toli, I'm going to toss it over to you, jump off stage, and everyone have fun.
00:01:25.824 - 00:01:50.904, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you, Austin. So I'll kind of like, I think we'll do like a brief round of intros, just like one sentence about yourself, and then we'll, like, kind of start to get into the, into the meat of this meat of it. I think I'll go in the order as you guys appear on my screen, which is randomly decided by livestorm. So. So Sam is first. So you want to like.
00:01:50.904 - 00:01:53.640, Speaker C: Yeah, 2 seconds, two second intro.
00:01:53.832 - 00:02:06.604, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm Sam. I run Alameda and FTX and serum and, I don't know, apparently distressed projects at large when that needs to be Tegan.
00:02:07.504 - 00:02:24.734, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. My name is Tegan Klein. I come from traditional finance, so investment banking at bank of America sells and trading at Barclays, and now I'm helping to kind of pave the way forward for DeFi at the graph, which is an indexing and query protocol that many Defi applications are built upon.
00:02:25.874 - 00:02:37.282, Speaker C: Awesome. I think. Michael, you're next. Michael.
00:02:37.418 - 00:02:37.770, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:02:37.802 - 00:02:49.994, Speaker E: Yeah, my name is Michael. I am the founder of curve market maker for stable coins. And. Yeah, I guess that's, that'll be it.
00:02:51.014 - 00:02:52.594, Speaker C: And Stani.
00:02:56.134 - 00:03:08.594, Speaker F: I'm Stani. I'm the founder and CEO of Aave, which is a decentralized money market protocol now for lending and borrowing. So to earn yields on your deposits.
00:03:10.594 - 00:03:28.254, Speaker C: Awesome. And I'm Anatoly, co founder, CEO of Solana. Been building a high performance layer one for two and a half years now. So awesome to have you guys here. And like, as Austin mentioned, this is about kind of the future of.
00:03:30.914 - 00:03:31.250, Speaker A: Hey.
00:03:31.282 - 00:03:35.774, Speaker D: Can you give me some water for me?
00:03:36.964 - 00:04:05.544, Speaker C: So I kind of want to let you guys hit this off. To start off with this is, does my daughter need water faster than we're going to get adoption and defi, or I guess in the next to kind of rephrase that question, what water? What are we seeing as like the next up, like near term, kind of like breakout things in the space?
00:04:08.324 - 00:04:45.910, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, as always, I think, like, you know, scaling matters just a ton. I think that, like, it matters right now. Like, clearly ethereum as it exists right now, has run out of room to scale already. But I also think that the long term vision matters a lot. And the difference, you know, difference between 101,010 thousand and million and a billion tps matters. And there are different visions for that and they sort of imply different things about what Defi is going to look like. But I think figuring out that problem is both going to be really important for its own right and also have a lot of implications for everything else.
00:04:45.910 - 00:05:01.208, Speaker A: I mean, I think, like, it certainly has had huge implications for serum. And I'm guessing for most of the rest of you, you have a whole laundry list of things you'd want to do, sort of dependent on how constrained you are on things sort of long term with, with what you're doing.
00:05:01.256 - 00:05:33.164, Speaker D: So I echo that. I think that is like the big opens question right now is like, how does scaling happen? Does that happen on Ethereum, or on a L2, or on another blockchain, or on a multitude of those. And I think the big problem with multiple blockchains is composability. And I'm hoping that the graph, as we expand to multiple blockchains, we can kind of help with composability so that it's easier for app developers to interact with different chains without needing to really understand, like the low level differences between chains.
00:05:37.944 - 00:05:39.244, Speaker C: What do you think, Michael?
00:05:39.584 - 00:06:24.774, Speaker E: Yeah, I think composability for the end user application is actually a much easier problem than composability for the transactions happening on chain. And yeah, I don't know what would be a good way to, to transact on several chains simultaneously. That's. I don't even know if there are solutions for that. You could, of course, do like several transactions and do transactions on one chain, way to do another chain, wait until it's settled, whatever. But to do like, single transaction arbitrage across chains, I think. I've never heard of anything like that.
00:06:27.094 - 00:06:50.754, Speaker C: This is something that I thought might be possible. If Ethereum was fast enough, you could, like, within a single transaction, get some settlement guarantees from Solana within a single block. But, but I think that's still probably not something that we should invest engineering time on. Maybe we have bigger problems.
00:06:52.394 - 00:06:55.974, Speaker E: Maybe Ethereum l two can interact with Solana.
00:06:56.754 - 00:07:53.874, Speaker C: That is like, so like my, you know, we're probably going to talk about optimistic roll ups eventually, but I think that that technology is almost a perfect bridge solution, more so than even a scaling solution, because the guarantees that you get is that the remote set of like, signers that are doing your l two are not breaking the logic rules of the contract. And if you can maintain those guarantees, then the dependency and the signers, like colluding or even intrusion of those skis become much, much lower. You get a much smaller security surface. I think it's kind of like. So I'm super excited about that kind of work, because while folks think that l two scaling will kill all the other l one s, I think it'll actually make him better with. Yep. Yeah, sorry, what?
00:07:54.034 - 00:07:56.734, Speaker E: Is it possible to do it with ZK roll ups?
00:07:57.314 - 00:08:50.724, Speaker C: Yeah, there's always straight ups with zero knowledge stuff that are really hard to quantify. So I'm not, I'm a poor operating systems engineer, not a cryptographer. So, Stani, kind of like, I wanted to ask you this question. Kind of came up with my chat with the comp folks. Is it good enough to take Aave a tokens or borrow from Aave and move them through wormhole to Solana and trade him on serum. Is that like good enough composability? Because this kind of bounces off what Michael said, that from a user's perspective, are they even going to care that there's multiple chains or rollups? They will see like a fancy Ui, that kind of does it for them.
00:08:51.344 - 00:09:56.182, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it is. I mean, that's kind of like a short answer for it, because, I mean, a tokens are practically interest bearing tokens, so they're in some way kind of bonds, but also or receipts of the underlying. And the balance, those tokens, increases periodically. What's interesting there is that if you breach those tokens into Solanine and for example, you trade them on serum, you could actually trade the interest rate practically every second. Because on ethereum, the interest rate changes. I mean, it actually is credited every second, and that's done algorithmically, so you don't need transactions there actually. But to swap the position from one, a token, let's say, AUSDC, to a dai and back and forth, that becomes more interesting, where you can do it more frequently and you don't have that much gas.
00:09:56.182 - 00:10:55.854, Speaker F: It doesn't make sense to swap the a tokens and pay, let's say, $20.20 USD worth of gas, and you will just do it more rare occasions. And here, if you could do it more frequently and in the same way as you would trade fixed income instruments, that will be pretty cool. And the cool part is that the bridging with the algorithmic balances is doable in the way that you could have an oracle that inserts data into Solana, and it's pretty cheap because you don't have the same cost as you would put data to oracles into Ethereum. And basically that gives a lot of opportunities, not just for Aave, but in general, you could put a lot of off chain data into Solana and all these different applications. I'm pretty sure that we'll see a lot of this happening during this hackathon as well.
00:10:56.914 - 00:11:27.796, Speaker E: Interesting. Sounds really, really interesting. Is it possible to even, like, I can quite imagine kerm working on Solana with these tokens very quickly. So do you think it is possible to, let's say, swap these tokens while, let's say, somebody deposits something on Aave and that changes interest rates by a lot, you know, some whale coming in. And when you see that in mempool, while it's in Ethereum mempool, you can already swap the tokens on Solana.
00:11:27.860 - 00:11:28.504, Speaker C: So to.
00:11:28.604 - 00:11:30.624, Speaker E: To have it faster than actually Ethereum.
00:11:30.664 - 00:11:32.604, Speaker F: Confirms it's a future.
00:11:34.664 - 00:12:05.776, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think these all super exciting. And right now you can do all parts of that except for the trustless bridge between Solana and Ethereum. Like, that's the tough part, right now, if you ignore that part, like, you can. Here's one thing I think be fucking awesome. It's like there's a. There's a Dex on theorem in which you can trade, like, bitcoin against USDC, right? Or let's say ether against USDC, but that could also be an aave ether against Aave USDC market. I think you may even have brought this up, Stani, and it's all trust.
00:12:05.776 - 00:12:33.886, Speaker A: I mean, it would take someone literally ten minutes to create this Dex. Like, there's tooling for. It's all open, it's all public, so you just do it and launch it. And then you'd have a replica of the serum, Dex, except everyone gets interest constantly on all the things there. And you can do a similar thing with curve. Again, you sort of get the wrappers onto serum. You can have the curve pool there, but also just anywhere that you see USDC, you could replace it.
00:12:33.886 - 00:12:37.074, Speaker A: So it's really easy to do those things.
00:12:37.854 - 00:12:46.486, Speaker E: Yeah, you could put Aave tokens, stablecoin tokens in curve pool on Solana.
00:12:46.670 - 00:12:47.462, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:12:47.598 - 00:12:58.430, Speaker E: Take the pull token, which is a kind of Us dollar, which is growing even faster because of peace, and put that in an order book to be traded against whatever.
00:12:58.502 - 00:13:21.384, Speaker A: Exactly. And then you just have another bitcoin USD order book, except it's jacked up with interest from both Aave and curve simultaneously. And I think that's super exciting. And again, it's just not that hard. Like, you have to build the curve pool there. Although I think the pools thing we're going to be releasing soon, make some version of these. Just like, super simple to do.
00:13:22.244 - 00:13:24.868, Speaker E: Like, the simple version is not very hard, I think.
00:13:25.036 - 00:14:09.428, Speaker A: Exactly. Like, getting governance is hard. Obviously, if you have, like, full governance on Solana based on your token, you have to, like, there's no template for that, although probably someone's gonna build one soon, but. So, yeah, I think these are super cool. The biggest pain point right now is that, like, you know, I think sort of the real truth is right now, every cross chain protocol of any sort is sort of in this gray area, you know, like anything. And there's a spectrum, but, like, you know, these are all sort of like, variants on, like, a multi sig wallet. And the question is just like, is it? Do you have some developed node system of multisigs? Do you have like, a guy who has the one signature? Do you have, like, you know, between, like WBTC or Ren or whatever, but.
00:14:09.428 - 00:14:10.624, Speaker A: But as.
00:14:12.064 - 00:14:16.136, Speaker C: So a layer one. A layer one in itself is a multi site, right?
00:14:16.200 - 00:14:56.814, Speaker A: Yeah, a layer one is sort of. Right, um, but there's building sort of like the. The closest you can get to trustless movement across this barrier. It's not that hard. Like, it's hard. It's really fucking finicky. And I mean, I probably some of you guys know more about this and I have thought more about it, but, like, you can convince yourself it's easy until someone says the word fork and you're like, oh, God, how is my trustless on chain protocol going to detect a contentious fork in one of the two layer ones and decide what to do and, like, what this thing is, you know? Okay, so, like, it's like.
00:14:56.814 - 00:15:16.344, Speaker A: But you can get, if you put in a lot of effort to get the edge cases right, you can get pretty close there. Even without that, though, right now with the sort of like, okay, bridges that exist, easy to use, but like, you know, only, only moderately decentralized everything else you can do. And it's just super exciting. And I think, yeah, like this, there's.
00:15:16.384 - 00:15:53.288, Speaker C: Also some, like, I think, cool under, I think, overlook shortcuts for now, which is, I think, like partly where the graph comes in is like this idea of like just migrating, like computing the, the data, the state of Ethereum, right. And giving some kind of guarantees about that state through a network like the graph, right? Like, I was setting this up for you, Teigen, so I kind of want you to kind of roll with it.
00:15:53.456 - 00:16:24.872, Speaker D: I was going to say, you know, that is one thing that the graph does. I think that that'll be even more important when we have, like, sharded blockchain, just so that you can kind of identify the data and serve that data to your users without having to think a lot about the underlying blockchain. And I think that is another form of, like, interoperability, which is kind of more of a speculative use case of the graph. But you could imagine the graph being like the source of truth for some oracles. And that's kind of similar to what we've seen, like with chain link, the chain link use case with Ethereum, but it could also apply across multiple chains.
00:16:25.048 - 00:16:39.664, Speaker A: Right? So, like, the graph is sort of the opposite of an oracle. Like an oracle takes off chain things and writes it to chain, the graph, takes on chain things, writes it off chain. What are you guys thinking about in terms of completing that loop for cross chain stuff?
00:16:40.124 - 00:16:59.712, Speaker D: I think that it will be a lot of partnerships with folks like chainlink that do partake in the oracle space. So we have that partnership. So now any chain link oracle data can be indexed and queried by the graph. And so we'll just continue that. And we have other skills and other partner. That's a L2, and then we'll be announcing another exciting one soon.
00:16:59.828 - 00:17:06.244, Speaker A: And how about the other way? Like, is it, can Chainlink consume data from the graph as an oracle feed?
00:17:07.024 - 00:17:09.384, Speaker D: I'm not sure about that one, potentially.
00:17:09.504 - 00:18:25.774, Speaker C: So to me, that that is actually like a hard, a hard engineering problem to implement inside the chain. It is kind of a very dumb thing that when you think about it, like, I have this box, right, that has a bunch of state, but it's very expensive for that box to go look at every bit in the box and give you an answer, right? Especially if you just looking at the current state is expensive, but even more expensive is to like, look at the current state as it changes over time, right? Or like, go look up. Is this transaction part of the history, right? Like those Merkel proofs are building. That stuff is just enormously, like hard and slow and costly, right, for like, something like, like a network that is partially trustless or externally trustless where some verifiable NPC. The cool thing about it is it can run computations that everybody can verify and then it can guarantee the state and feed it back into the state machine and then we can do cool stuff. To me, this is, I think the exciting thing about composability is taking stuff like the graphics and like mixing it in between networks like that. That's kind of like what I'm excited about as an engineer.
00:18:27.194 - 00:18:28.174, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:18:29.394 - 00:18:59.544, Speaker C: I'm like, I don't know, I'm just like. I think the space is like, kind of blossoming into, like, I think like we went from like really basic stuff in 2017, like, that barely worked and like a bunch of people got heads down and like, work their asses off and now we have like, I think, very sophisticated tools that do really kind of like magical things that I think are still, like, now have the opportunity to grow and like, really gain adoption.
00:19:01.724 - 00:19:11.460, Speaker F: Yeah, I still remember those days when we run our own oracle. It was like whenever there's like maintenance issues, like, it's pretty much like the Oracle.
00:19:11.652 - 00:19:40.670, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, FTX, to be clear entirely, does that like when you're writing, when you're developing a centralized application. One thing we've learned again and again and again is that modularity is just bad. Trying to use third party services is just bad. It's just a mistake. Unless you're going to go all in on one, like, you're going to be like, this is our whole thing, then it completely makes sense. And I think that like, a white label is an example of that. We're like, yes, we're going to fucking make this integration work.
00:19:40.670 - 00:20:04.874, Speaker A: But they serve like, yeah, and it'll kind of integrate there with this thing. Don't do it. And the reason, it's just like, it doesn't fucking work. And these conversations all break down in the same mysterious ways which someone's like, sorry, we need your developers to work on stuff. And we're like, what you mean literally our front end just like, consumes our API feed. It's a public API feed. Provably, you can do the same things we can do.
00:20:04.874 - 00:20:21.804, Speaker A: Like, no, you don't have like, p and all day we're like, yes, we do. Not over Websocket, to be clear. You need to be streaming monthly p and l figures every hundred milliseconds. That's your case. And that's what we need. And we're like, no, you don't like, yeah, we do, and that's the problem with the integration. Like, there goes your integration.
00:20:21.804 - 00:21:39.146, Speaker A: You're like, either going to fight through that or you're not, but defi kind of turns that on its head. First of all, because you have to, to do these things, but second of all, like, everyone has already agreed before it all started to use the same, or at least everyone on the same l one has already agreed to use the same interfacing for everything, right? Which is like the blockchain. And so when you think about composing with another thing, it's just so much fucking easier because you're all speaking the same language, you're all running on, like, you know, the same, the same system and such. It's like they forcibly had to give you everything you could possibly use because it's all open and because it's all you can look inside the various boxes, you can just prove what's going to happen and you don't have to worry about what if they just start returning garbage data for a reason that, like, no one can tell? You're like, no, it can fucking read their code. Like, I know what it's going to do. You know, it's like I can actually compose it exactly the way it's supposed to. I mean, on chain composability is just so much cleaner and pure and more powerful than off chain composability is.
00:21:39.330 - 00:22:18.734, Speaker F: And this is the difference between the web two and web3 completely. There is one style. There's of course, many things you can do, but basically once you deploy something, you can just interact with everything. Not just kind of like, you don't have the mess with what Sam explained, but also kind of like you can actually access anything that there is, unless there's like some sort of like permissions, but by default, it's, it's all there. You know, it's like browsing the Internet as an end user. Now, as a developer, you can just build anything, you know, and products that didn't exist before.
00:22:19.994 - 00:22:38.164, Speaker D: Absolutely. It's like this open data layer, and then people are building on top of that data, and then other applications are using their data to build more applications. And it's a positive feedback loop that I think is only going to continue. And we're going to see, like, this waterfall effect from, like, web two into web3 now that it's so much easier to build in this space.
00:22:41.384 - 00:23:15.304, Speaker C: Yeah, 100%. I think the data set was actually one of the things that me as, like, a, like, when I used to trade my really crappy algorithms against interactive brokers, I never had enough data to actually verify them. And having all of this really cool, sophisticated financial information just be open by default, I think, is really eliminating the insider advantage. I'm excited about that.
00:23:16.644 - 00:23:33.844, Speaker D: Totally. I mean, I think, like, what Bloomberg. Bloomberg terminal, right? We all used it in finance. It, like, just closed data. Like, and they have an ip on that data, like, why? And then they're like a billion dollar company, billions of dollars. So now we're opening that up. But that is one thing I am excited to see in the defi space.
00:23:33.884 - 00:23:34.036, Speaker A: Pull.
00:23:34.060 - 00:23:49.104, Speaker D: You asked this earlier, is like the Bloomberg for everything, you know? Because right now it's so fragmented. You go to trade and you're on many different platforms, and I think, Sam, you're working on this, but that is one thing I'm really excited about, is having, like, a one stop shop to do everything.
00:23:49.484 - 00:24:12.354, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. One thing that, like, here's a task that someone's working on right now on serum, a literal, just a fucking search bar that, like, I mean, you can put in your app and you want. I think fucking everyone should. Where it's just like, there's like a list of all the apps people have built. You just like, type it in and then, like, you know, switch quickly between them. That's not the best way to do it. Whatever, but it's better than nothing.
00:24:12.354 - 00:24:59.510, Speaker A: But yeah, a whole App Store or whatever the form of it is something to make it less of a mess would be great. I think that would really simplify things also. Okay, here's the thing I think is super cool. I don't know what other people is really fucking awesome is one cool thing about throughput is you can just do things that seem, like, hilariously impossible on blockchain, but at some point they become possible. I think one, two examples. Like, how about an instant messaging service where all the messages are encrypted and on chain? You can actually do that on Solana social networks. Could you have a social network fully on chain? Yeah, you could.
00:24:59.510 - 00:25:21.374, Speaker A: Um, and. And, you know, I think it'd be really cute if like, the Bloomberg of crypto from the chat functionality, you know, was an on chain product. I think that that would be fitting. Um, I. But I, you know, I also think it just sort of like, opens the door to, like, it's not just trading. Like, a lot of things can theoretically be on chain.
00:25:21.954 - 00:26:55.034, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, there's like, if you think about it, like, even like, you know, stuff, like lot of data and transactions stuff, for example, like things that is happening, for example, in ride sharing or, you know, this big platforms with multiple transactions in small area, you know, so it's kind of, there's like, I think we had a chat yesterday with Anatoly, and what was interesting is that kind of like, what I think in this hackathon especially, like, we'll see some of the use cases will be completely different than Ethereum, mainly for the reason that actually you have this, this scalability and high frequency, so you could actually develop stuff that you otherwise will not think building on Ethereum. Or maybe we'll do it on L2 or whatnot. And that's still not, not very feasible. So I think we'll, what I think what happens is that we'll see a bit different kind of ecosystem on Solana, which is based on this kind of, like, high frequency stuff. And probably we will see a lot of finance, but I think there's also kind of like, use cases where you just have massive amounts of transactions and now you have actually like a immutable register of it and contracts. And this, this is going to be a very interesting ecosystem in that sense.
00:26:55.774 - 00:28:13.874, Speaker C: So my, my feeling is that, like, the, like, the consensus part is like, just like, implementation details and, like, the real powerful thing is the cryptography side of it. Like, we, like, we don't live currently in a world where people outside of crypto can sign things and, like, guarantee that, hey, I sign this BGP email was a thing that two geeks tried to make work and nobody used it. But I think crypto can actually change that. And to me, that is not a security privacy thing, but I think it's incredibly empowering because we now can do things like governance, do things like, if you have 100 million people that have cryptography and cryptographic identities, we can build a credit system on top of that. And, like, we can do things that, like, are done outside of crypto, but internally in this world. So to me, that is kind of like, opens up the door to new things, like, and that's super exciting. I'm like, I'm wondering how do you guys view like governance in general? Like, like, like personally I think the governance stuff that we see today is like the six degrees of the nineties.
00:28:13.874 - 00:28:21.614, Speaker C: Like it's going to be something that is much bigger than you expect. But like I'm just wondering what your take on it is.
00:28:24.354 - 00:29:04.274, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely agree. I think, well probably before today governance wasn't really much like much utilized or wasn't really going beyond some, you know, some theater rather than a real thing. But right now in many protocols it does become a real thing and it does become decentralized. And I think firstly it will apply in like these daos and in like daos which drive different projects, but it probably could go beyond that. It could have social implications.
00:29:08.614 - 00:29:08.902, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:08.918 - 00:30:10.144, Speaker F: And I think for us, I mean it was a big day today. We practically gave the admin keys to the community, to the other token holders. I mean it really feels good. I mean in the sense that you're not like with your team kind of like in control or making those decisions that now there's actually big group of people and anyone can be a part of that. It really feels good. And I mean probably today I feel that governance is more powerful than I felt yesterday when this happened. But also I think the magnitude that is going to be and also like the programmability and rest of the functionality, it will be pretty interesting to see like, and how maybe like how would it spill over into the, you know, like let's say if you need to decide something related to real world and how this kind of on chain governance can spill over in those places.
00:30:11.564 - 00:30:47.534, Speaker D: I think it's really admirable of a lot of the founders in the blockchain space. I think it's very different than most founders in the traditional space because you have to be able to really like give away your protocol and your project. But I think like governance is still a massive experiment and that experiment's in progress. And like the graph has taken a different approach from like having a governance token to instead kind of finding product market fit and then releasing, you know, and then decentralizing the network and then we're going to have like a technical council that oversees our foundation. But we kind of moved away. We're not doing like a governance token, like a compound.
00:30:50.634 - 00:31:49.704, Speaker C: These are like pretty tough and hard decisions to make and it's pretty early, like, I think like a layer one is by definition its own governance token because those are the people that decide everything, right? Like the fundamental consensus part. So that's something kind of like, that was kind of baked in from the start. But as things move up the stack, it's really interesting to me how people experiment with, with this. One thought that I had, Vitalik was talking about this two years ago. I feel like he's always just way a bit ahead of everyone. And I thought that it's interesting to see that if a community based around a token can develop faster than corporation because there's less politics in a lot of ways. Like, it's like an incredibly flat organization.
00:31:52.084 - 00:33:01.684, Speaker A: I think that there's a lot of things that often get bundled together and it's maybe worth unbundling some of them when it, or at least thinking about them separately. When it comes to governance, and for a lot of reasons, this term governance token has just come. It's dis euphemism if people say it and people are like, oh yeah, it's one of those things. But there's actually a pretty wide set of disparate things that go into that, all joined by the fact that if it has full governance rates, then technically could have anything else because you just vote for it. But there's one thing of the value of the platform flows through the token holders one way or another, which I think is important to have at least some piece of. Otherwise, what's this token doing? Also, there's, you know, the sort of, when you, when you think about governance, like, you know, I think that one question is like, can someone build something new or does that need to get approved by governance? There's another question of can you modify something existing without governance with governments, not even with government governance. Like that's sort of like a separate question.
00:33:01.684 - 00:33:54.938, Speaker A: And I think they're quite distinct. And I think that like the place that certainly serum has been trending that I think a number of people, I think Vitalik has said that and maybe Hayden have expressed that they like this vision. Although I'm not pulling, sure is like, I think there's a huge difference between releasing new things and editing existing things because one is sort of like dangerous. One could steal people's money sort of in a way that the other doesn't. And so I think that like it's way more important to be super scared of like modifications to existing protocols, especially once people are already using have money in. Like one of the modifications could be like all the money goes to this address, for instance, versus like someone launches, you know, a new thing that's like people no one's using right now. People could choose not to use.
00:33:54.938 - 00:34:33.706, Speaker A: I think, like one vision of governance is like, anyone build whatever they want. But, like, maybe you need some strong governance in order to modify it. Maybe you can only do it in certain ways which are predefined to, like, make sure they can't destroy shit, you know, sort of finding places where you really need governance where. As opposed to places where you can just say, yeah, anyone can build what they want and let the market decide what it wants to use. You know, places. And think, like another example. This is like naming conflict, right? That's like a great use for governance, right? I think that's something we've been thinking about on Solana is like, what, what is, you know, can everyone call themselves soul? The Solana token.
00:34:33.706 - 00:34:53.107, Speaker A: Like. Like, is that a name? And everything can say, and like, you have this token, like, is this soul like. Yeah, it's soul. Like, the soul, like, you know, and so I think that's another thing where, like, having a governance, like, vote on, like, no, that. That soul, this thing, you can't call it soul, you know, anything else but not soul, I think would be like another kind of reasonable use for it.
00:34:53.235 - 00:35:05.903, Speaker C: The domain that DNS is the hardest problem on the Internet, and it is one of the hardest problems of blockchain, too, in an interesting way.
00:35:06.443 - 00:35:25.424, Speaker D: Yeah, we created Everest, which is a passion project we did on the side. And I like to use the analogy that it's like the LinkedIn for the blockchain space. So we wanted to make web3 more tangible. And so any application that exists in web3 can exist on Everest. And then there's kind of like a reputation system. So that could probably also work with, like the tickers of projects too.
00:35:27.964 - 00:35:29.744, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree.
00:35:30.604 - 00:36:06.864, Speaker C: Yeah, that, I think is like part of. Part of the human world. I think it's just that information is going to seep into the chain and kind of be usable. So that's kind of pretty interesting. Well, do you guys have, do you see the space maturing into something where there is a Bloomberg terminal of crypto protocols? It's got a how far away? I know it's coming, but how far away is that? Or is it already here? I just don't know because I'm latency weeds.
00:36:07.244 - 00:36:31.064, Speaker D: We saw something using the graph, creating an open API, a subgraph for nfts. And so nfts, it was very fragmented, and then someone created a subgraph that put them all together so that they could see all of their nfts, one wallet. So I think it's not that far away. I think that you could do the same thing with, with Defi, with, with everything that exists in the space. But we do we need like the Robin hood of crypto.
00:36:32.404 - 00:37:27.814, Speaker F: Yeah, I think, you know, it's always been interesting. Like I mentioned, this maybe like few, few dozens of times will be cool to have just like a, you know, terminal where you just write, you know, aave deposit, you know, 100 die and it goes to Aave. Then you might have something like, you know, curve deposit, 100 die and so forth, or like flash loan and, you know, this kind of things. And I think this could be quite interesting because like people could plug in into this terminal and do commands practically. This could be like an interesting way to get some adoption as well. Maybe someone could build this on this hackathon. I tried to pitch this couple of times on the Ethereum hackathon.
00:37:27.814 - 00:37:33.314, Speaker F: So maybe someone who is really hardcore on Solana could actually pull this.
00:37:38.554 - 00:37:51.094, Speaker C: Um, I like to, there's a question that's kind of related to this, like for Sam. Like how, why, how hard would it be to take the FDX UI and point it at serum?
00:37:51.474 - 00:38:21.850, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. It's so right. Um, it's complicated. So it depends on exactly what you mean by the FTX UI, because some parts of the UI make no sense in the context of serum. So you'd have to cut those. Like, most of the work is cutting out the parts that don't make sense in that context. You'd have to think about like who manages risk, for instance.
00:38:21.850 - 00:38:48.710, Speaker A: Is it like if there's like margin on both, is it like an FTX risk engine? Is it a serum based risk engine? Like there's a lot of places where you're trying to decide what draws the line. If it's literally just the GUI. So like the FTX and making decisions. Just a GUI, it, like, you know, it would. Nothing is theoretically hard about it. It's just a ton of toiling. Like, it's a ton of like, okay, here are like 3000 different features of it, and like 2000 of them need to be tweaked.
00:38:48.710 - 00:39:33.824, Speaker A: Not in a fundamentally existential way, but in like, okay, like, it's not hourly funding. Like, let me clean up that part. Okay, now onto number like 1253 of the things to clean up. So it's, again, theoretically it's not hard, but you almost might want to like just rebuild it with the same design philosophies because there's going to be so many tweaks that like you're just going to end up rewriting a lot of the raw code, although it's going to be important to have all the instincts from having built it that you sort of like have thought through a lot of the things that come up and have like tools in your toolkit for it, but there's nothing theoretically hard about it. It's just lining everything up and making sure that you've cleaned up all the differences.
00:39:37.124 - 00:39:49.612, Speaker C: I think underneath that question is this theoretical idea. Can you take a centralized service like FTX and make it fully decentralized and are like, do we have enough of the pieces there?
00:39:49.668 - 00:39:51.356, Speaker A: Like, yeah, you can do it.
00:39:51.380 - 00:39:55.264, Speaker C: Can you like borrow from serum and like plug that into the UI?
00:39:55.724 - 00:40:10.964, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like all the fundamental pieces are there, or, sorry, almost all. I'll just fucking say what I think all the pieces are. I spent a lot of time thinking about this. Here's all the pieces here. Here's like the set of primitives. And if you have all of these, you have everything. Not everything, we have almost everything.
00:40:10.964 - 00:40:40.174, Speaker A: In finance, you need a matching engine which exists on serum. You need a borrow lending protocol which is not currently exist on serum. There's a lot of people theoretically building one. We'll see what happens there. Obviously, if Avi ported over, that would do it. That works. But you need some way to get borrower or lending or leverage or whatever.
00:40:40.174 - 00:41:07.054, Speaker A: That's another fundamental protocol. You need a price, you need a stable coin. Basically. You kind of can't do any of this without a stable coin. And there's USDC on there, obviously you can get jacked up USDC with lots of yield and stuff and, or combine multiple ones through curve or something like that. So there's a lot of improvements you can make on that, but you need something like that. You need the thing.
00:41:07.054 - 00:41:53.094, Speaker A: You need an oracle, probably. Basically you need an oracle system to make this work, but it doesn't actually, if you need to be an off chain oracle, it can be 100% on chain. You can just be feeding spot market order book prices back to themselves, basically. So you can do this all without leaving chain. You don't need anything that you need to trust, but you do need to build that system, and you need that for liquidations, for instance for the borrower lending protocol. But again, you can just use the spot order books on serum, and once you have those, you can just do it. You need to tie everything up together, you need to compose them.
00:41:53.094 - 00:42:48.524, Speaker A: You're all composing on chain. You don't need to leave the chain at any point. The GUI needs to understand, obviously what commands need to be sent, but once you have those, you have everything. And like a cool thing you can build futures out of borrow lending protocols, like kind of a fun fact, it's not actually a different thing, and there's a lot of variance on this, a lot of modifications you can do. You might want to pool primitive both for borrower lending, but also there are a lot of things where collective action is kind of central to something and it makes it way fucking easier. But yeah, you can just do all this and nothing here is magic. It's all things people have done before, just doing them all on the same fast style one and composing them correctly and having the GUI do the right thing.
00:42:48.524 - 00:43:29.130, Speaker A: And then you have basically close to everything, maybe for a little bit more. How about leveraged tokens for structured products, or algorithmic hedge funds or whatever the fuck you want to call them. Yeah, you can do it. You built, you have a pool, you have an on chain pool, you program the rebalancing, whatever it's supposed to do. You have a trade on an order book to do its rebalancing, you have creations, redemptions, that's just like Amm LP, you know, adding or removing liquidity, and now you have that, that's what the product is. The LP tokens are the fund, and you can just trade, take those LP tokens, trade them on the DeX, and now you have structured products, you have ETF's, mutual funds, whatever you want. And that's what the pool primitive is like based around.
00:43:29.130 - 00:43:55.754, Speaker A: You want yield. Yeah, you already have that. You're just dropping in this pool, whoever you're trying to yield to have them all bleeds to the same pool and drop it, whoever in the pool on the LP token, same thing, the pieces are all there, it's just putting them all in the same place and composing them all together and having the right GUI for it, and you could actually have something that feels like a fully featured a crypto financial ecosystem all on chain, and it just like works.
00:43:59.254 - 00:44:03.594, Speaker C: I hope this is recorded because there are like 20 startup ideas in that like two minutes.
00:44:05.574 - 00:44:37.054, Speaker A: Like honestly I'm not trying to take like I want other people to do, there's too much fucking work for any one person to do. Like it's like, yeah, sure we can try and build a borrow lending protocol if you have to. Like way rather off I do it, they've done it before, they know how to do it. And also, you know, also if users also then like, you know, work on other things and like, you know, combine all together. And so like, you know, this is, I, the more people build things. This is the fucking power of defi. The more people build these things, you just compose them and you get the power of them all put together, no matter who built them.
00:44:37.054 - 00:44:49.574, Speaker A: And it's not like you have to reduplicate them all yourself. And so I, you know, that's going to be the next big sprint on, on serum, I think, is going to be people building out all the primitives and then composing them together.
00:44:53.954 - 00:45:00.574, Speaker C: Jagan, do you think, like, the days for your friends at like, Barclays and Bloomberg are kind of numbered?
00:45:02.514 - 00:45:14.704, Speaker D: It's a lot of them are calling me asking how they crypto. So I think that's a good signal. But yeah, I'm excited to pull a lot of that in into this space and yeah, build for them.
00:45:17.444 - 00:45:39.304, Speaker C: I, like, I find that, like, the folks coming out of from finance are smart and ambitious and, like, hard working and have a good attitude. So, like, I think it's like, overall a good thing and, like, brings like, a new perspective from like, the California engineers that are at least dominant in the west coast kind of like crypto community.
00:45:41.024 - 00:45:43.964, Speaker D: They've gone through a proper hazing of banking.
00:45:45.264 - 00:45:46.044, Speaker C: Yep.
00:45:48.224 - 00:45:49.004, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:49.904 - 00:46:11.684, Speaker C: How worried are you guys about, like, the stacking of the technical risks of, like, borrowing one token from one smart contract into another one into a third one, putting that into a spot market and leveraging that, like, a single rounding error, causing some unforeseen consequences?
00:46:15.764 - 00:46:16.212, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:16.268 - 00:46:17.024, Speaker E: Oh, yeah.
00:46:18.244 - 00:46:59.450, Speaker A: Let me just say that, like, as someone who also runs a centralized exchange, like, the thought of not being able to have human sanity checks and of open sourcing all of the code is fucking terrifying. Like, it's like, it's just so fucking impossible to cover all of the edge cases perfectly beforehand. It's like so many things are like, okay, if anything that kind of, like, this happens, like, just stop and, like, freeze and, like, alert. Like, the core developers and require a few people to sign off on this thing before anything, before, like, this withdrawals process, because, like, that's kind of sketchy. Like, you just like, fucking need that. Every exchange has them. Like, you wonder like, oh, why is this withdrawal in particular taking a while? It trips some fucking risk parameter.
00:46:59.450 - 00:47:14.540, Speaker A: Who knows what? Probably it's nothing. Like, probably it's a false alarm. Like, you know, that that's, that's the core of it. And we're sort of like, oh, God. Like, everyone who tries to penetrate exchanges is so dumb. Like, they're doing such a bad job of it. But of course they are like a, they have to get through all these heuristic things.
00:47:14.540 - 00:47:39.808, Speaker A: B, they don't know what's going on inside. And you're like, nah, you get none of those. Write the code once, never change it, never patch any bugs, no human intervention, no sanity checking. And it's all open source. So people just read it and see exactly what you're doing, exactly where your edge cases are. And like, you know, I mean, breaking the fucking serum decks, like, like writing a matching engine would have been like a one week project. Vince is a two month project.
00:47:39.808 - 00:48:05.514, Speaker A: And why was that? It was like all, every fucking edge case had to be covered, right? Like, there are days that were spent with like, oh, God, what if someone sends a number that's too big in this very specific space ten times in a row, and they overload this buffer? And then we start overwriting old memory on chain with this other thing? And like, is that an attack vector or at least a vector for someone to be able to brick that, you know, the market?
00:48:05.814 - 00:48:12.234, Speaker E: Is it, what is it what programming on smart contracts on Solana feels like.
00:48:12.574 - 00:48:52.504, Speaker A: It's what doing something really intricate on chain feels like. This is like, amms are not. Building an amm on salon is not like this at all. The tricky thing is that when you go to an order book, it's not conceptually complicated, but there's just a lot of moving pieces, and every moving piece is an attack vector. The problem is that there's this place that things go after they've been matched while the matching engine is still running in a way that doesn't apply to an amm. And you're like, okay, we got to make sure this queue can never get overloaded no matter what happens.
00:48:53.484 - 00:48:57.224, Speaker E: Yeah, I think you advertised amms to me enough.
00:49:01.764 - 00:49:26.344, Speaker C: But the cool thing is, the beauty of, like, smart contracts is that once somebody builds it and it works, and it's been working for like six months, eight months, nine months, a year, people are like, okay, we've kind of exhausted all the possible bugs. And this is like a service, right? It goes from, like, an experimental thing to like, just, just from.
00:49:28.274 - 00:50:31.788, Speaker E: It certainly helps. I would say I was surprised with two things in blockchain world. One thing is actually, well, depends on the time. But at least in April, I found a bug in one curve smart contract. Well, everyone was successfully migrated, but I was a little bit shocked that nobody else found it because it was actually a pretty simple one to detect. At the same time, I'm positively shocked with the number of white hats in the blockchain space because, I don't know, it feels like more than half of people who find exploits, they are actually white hats and even black hats. Like, if you take their harvest hack on this Monday, attacker somehow stopped at 25 million.
00:50:31.788 - 00:50:58.582, Speaker E: I don't know what was the harvest total value lock. Was it like close to 1 billion or something? So it was something large, I think. And so it feels like attacker took 2% of TVL and stop, but could have. Could have taken much more. I don't know. It's like, like, is it, is it some, you know? Yeah, it's interesting.
00:50:58.758 - 00:51:09.502, Speaker A: Yeah, I've thought a lot about this. I have two thoughts on it. First of all, yeah. I'm always confused, like, three thoughts. Me. I often have the same feeling. It's like, geez, like, that was super unambitious.
00:51:09.502 - 00:51:24.782, Speaker A: Like, if you're going to be a fucking sleazeball like this, please ball, who's also unambitious and has a conscious. It's a weird. I don't know what the second thing is. Decreasing marginal utility of money. I think some people are like, I got $20 million. That's all I need for life. I couldn't possibly want more.
00:51:24.782 - 00:51:54.896, Speaker A: Like, I'm not going to like that. My goal is just to get away with it. But the third thing, I think this is one of the key things, is if you try and do anything too big, you start running into issues you didn't see. I think a kucoin hack is a good example of that. Right? The kucoin hacker stole almost too much of some tokens. They stole so much that would have been fatal, and the tokens forked it just hard forked away from the hackers token. If the harvest hacker had actually taken a billion dollars, I don't know that they get anything.
00:51:54.896 - 00:52:06.844, Speaker A: I think there's this paradoxical thing where they take too much and people pull these levers they really don't want to pull, but they're just mutually destructive. But that they have to pull, it's too big. And we've seen this again.
00:52:10.744 - 00:52:11.280, Speaker F: I think.
00:52:11.352 - 00:52:13.208, Speaker C: Do you think that, like, the Ethereum.
00:52:13.296 - 00:52:22.444, Speaker A: Miners would, like, fork off at some point? I mean, look like you steal $20 billion of Ethereum. Yes. You know, there's a point at which they will.
00:52:27.384 - 00:53:20.654, Speaker F: If you think about it, in Ethereum, there's like, even like, black hackers, they're kind of like white hackers, but they just need a house or something in that particular moment. So they don't steal everything. But also, like, I mean, if you're talented, you don't want to hack the whole system. You know, you want to, you want to basically keep the system to continue and, and that is probably why you, you don't drain the whole thing because I mean, harvest, if it will be drained completely, that would be devastating. The whole Defi, I don't know, like it could be even like, I mean, it just doesn't affect harvest, it will affect curve and also those protocols that don't even interact with harvest or don't have the TVL in their protocols of the harvest. And if that happens, it might take a couple of years to come back to the point that people are excited about Defi again. And it's like this serious actually.
00:53:20.654 - 00:53:26.336, Speaker F: So I think the hackers are smart in that sense that they understand probably as well.
00:53:26.520 - 00:53:32.704, Speaker E: Yeah, well, kind of, kind of had the boundary between the hardware and security researcher.
00:53:32.864 - 00:54:06.690, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's, there are a lot of people who are on that boundary there. A lot of, I mean, okay, I don't know if this is thing indexes, it's certainly things. Centralized exchanges. There's people whose entire goal in life is to go to centralized exchanges claiming that they found a security flaw and asking for like some money in return for helping them fix it. And like there's a few people who are really well intentioned and only find and like really help the space. Most of these people, they just find some way to DDos some shitty endpoint no one cares about. And they're like, now, now pay me for ddosing you.
00:54:06.690 - 00:54:10.774, Speaker A: And we're like, come on, dude. Actually you're not.
00:54:11.154 - 00:54:25.232, Speaker E: I did have this experience with, with curve, with having one endpoint which collected statistics and some hacker found it and started ddosing it and writing me at the same time.
00:54:25.328 - 00:54:25.964, Speaker C: So.
00:54:26.464 - 00:54:47.854, Speaker E: Yeah, well, I mean, it was kind of, wasn't really, it wasn't serving anything really. Yeah, I did see kind of them trying to load it, but kind of quite unsuccessful and yeah, it was fun just to see.
00:54:50.914 - 00:55:11.530, Speaker A: Yeah, the coolest thing is often they don't understand. I think they must have bought some of these, try and describe what they're doing. Like, no, we know exactly what you're doing. Like, we found this critical, like, no, you're fucking calling this endpoint like 3000 times a second. And like, our rate limits like weren't quite restrictive on us. Now they are like, we can fucking see you. And they keep saying they're doing something.
00:55:11.530 - 00:55:14.694, Speaker A: I think they just literally don't know what. They bought it from someone else or something.
00:55:16.404 - 00:55:22.664, Speaker C: 3000 times a second is a good number to call an RPC endpoint.
00:55:23.524 - 00:55:27.624, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess kind of hold Solana blockchain with that.
00:55:32.884 - 00:55:47.022, Speaker C: That was a fun, fun challenge of launching serum was that things were not tuned exactly to the right parameters. So some of those RPCs were pinging it like 30,000 times a second.
00:55:47.198 - 00:56:15.444, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it was this weird experience. We're so used to being limited by the blockchain. The Solana blockchain is basically never a limiting factor for serum at all. But all the centralized, like, nodes that someone tried to run, which is immediate, like serum vectors, just immediately have it fall over and like, anyone can run these, like, it's like. But, you know, it's a fucking server. And like, you know, and so I. That is like, sort of interesting that like, the blockchain was not the limiting factor on capacity.
00:56:15.444 - 00:56:18.824, Speaker A: It was the servers sitting around it providing data.
00:56:21.804 - 00:56:58.170, Speaker C: It's actually a hard problem if you're building a database, optimizing it for writes, it's nearly impossible to make it also optimized for reads. You kind of like, gotta pick one or the other. And blockchains are like, write. Writes are the important part. If you do that, then you're like, what do we do for reads? Right? Which is like, I think, like, you have specialization for, like, things like the graph or like, you know, other kind of data aggregators become important. There's no, there's no, like, it's computer science, right? Like, stuff.
00:56:58.242 - 00:56:58.490, Speaker A: There's.
00:56:58.522 - 00:57:01.094, Speaker C: There's no, like, good answers. There's always trade off.
00:57:02.754 - 00:57:03.534, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:06.454 - 00:57:25.714, Speaker C: Do you guys have any, any closing words? This was a fun chat. I kind of wish. What I miss about crypto conferences is that, like, normally would be able to go get a beer after this, but might be able to have a beer on my own. But any closing words for the future? Defi.
00:57:29.994 - 00:57:44.254, Speaker D: I mean, I think that the blockchain is the future of the Internet. And right now in the middle of that is like this new financial system that we're creating that's expanding and that's really exciting, but I'm excited to see, like, all of the Internet kind of move over to web3.
00:57:48.874 - 00:57:58.234, Speaker E: Probably more exciting even to see the whole world financial system to move on chain. Who knows which chain, though.
00:57:58.734 - 00:58:07.714, Speaker A: Yep. We're all going to shock. Based on ghost chain from 2016, it's going to come back and master coin.
00:58:12.134 - 00:58:20.462, Speaker B: So we're already over time. But there are few really good questions here in the questions tab that didn't quite get answered. I'm going to throw like one or.
00:58:20.478 - 00:58:21.972, Speaker A: Two of the top ones up and.
00:58:21.988 - 00:58:37.620, Speaker B: Kind of let y'all take it before everyone, everyone jumps off. Let's start with this one. So currently, many farm trends are failed to maintain their farm token values. How you'll be able to solve it? Are there sustainable way to maintain the farm token value and attract new people? Ever since zero sum games is the.
00:58:37.652 - 00:59:21.816, Speaker A: Essence of the crypto world, I think the big thing is like, the fact that you can farm a token doesn't give it value. That's the opposite of giving it value. That's giving, that's giving it away. That's using its value to get users. In order for a farm token to retain its value, it must have had value to retain. I think the biggest thing I would say is, why do you think it was ever worth more than zero? If you can answer that question, then maybe you can answer the question of why it's still worth more than zero. I think that if you're farming with a token that is attached to a real protocol people actually want to use, right? That, like, it has value from that, independent of this farming, and like, it will retain that.
00:59:21.816 - 00:59:41.200, Speaker A: And so I think, like, you know, if your farm is dropping, like, you know, the tokens of anyone on this panel, I think that that, like, that's real, you know, but if the only reason that the token makes it exists is so that it can be dropped, then, like, who's, what, you know, where's, where's it all going when the farming ends?
00:59:41.232 - 01:00:35.164, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that actually reminds from non blockchain world, that reminds marketing with, I don't know, paid Facebook ads. You can definitely burn money to bring users via Facebook ads, but the question is, how much money are you burning with that? And let's say there are examples of electric scooters startups being bankrupt because of spending all their money on Facebook ads. The same applies to printing tokens. If the users who you bring, if they don't actually bring value to your platform, then that was pointless. But if they are bringing value to the platform, if that helps you to scale, then that's good. That works.
01:00:39.644 - 01:00:40.476, Speaker C: Cool, thank you.
01:00:40.500 - 01:00:54.264, Speaker B: Thank you for that. This one. This one's popped up a few times. I think both Sam and Tully have answered before, so I would love to get like a live dialogue on this. But what's more challenging, finding great ideas or finding people to build them?
01:00:54.964 - 01:00:56.584, Speaker F: Finding time to build.
01:00:58.764 - 01:01:03.584, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Cool. Is it enough?
01:01:04.164 - 01:01:54.962, Speaker E: Yeah, that actually depends on what they are, what the exact idea is. If it can be expressed as a sort of general kind, in general words, as kind of an idea, understandable, fully understandable by everyone, if there is nothing special in it, then chances are it's actually execution, which is the more, like, if it's like people who build who are more important, but sometimes it could be something really dense and something really so unobvious where, like, the idea part is actually, is actually important.
01:01:55.058 - 01:02:12.344, Speaker D: So, yeah, I think that's what's so exciting about, like, blockchain and protocols is like, you don't have to work for a company anymore now. You can work for ideas and so you can throw out ideas and then people can attach themselves it and then start building it. And so I think we're going to, like, flip the Fortune 500 companies on their heads with that.
01:02:15.124 - 01:02:38.930, Speaker A: I think it's finding people, but they have to be the right people. And that doesn't even mean the best people. It means the people who get along with you. Like, I want the best people to build on serum, but, like, not all the best people want to build on serum, especially people who, like, just can't fucking stand me. Like, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to say. You know? You know, like, like, you know, if you don't like anyone else building on them.
01:02:38.930 - 01:02:48.734, Speaker A: So, like, it's not just finding good people, but, but you finding people who fit into the particular tasks and culture and ecosystem is, is hard.
01:02:51.354 - 01:03:21.608, Speaker C: Yeah, it, it's like, you know, if you, if you have, like, I think there's a lot of good ideas, but you need the right person for it to kind of drive it. I don't know what it is. Like, there's just like, it's not like I could go and build a Dex because that's not my, like, passion. Right. Like, I'm, I'm more interested in, like, bits and latency, but it's tough. Right. Like, it's like a mix.
01:03:21.608 - 01:03:48.324, Speaker C: This is like, I think part of the challenge of, like, ecosystem funds and ecosystems is that they kind of create a list of ideas and, you know, there's like a, you know, if you, if, if you just have put a bunch of money on it, like, you'll attract the wrong people. Right. You attract people looking for the money, not people that are, like, inspired by those ideas. And that, that's, I think it's like a kind of a. Why a ton of the ecosystem plays fail.
01:03:48.744 - 01:04:06.754, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like what you almost want is someone who's like, yeah, I want to fucking do this. And of course there's a lot of money there. It's because it's an amazing idea. Yes, I care that there's money there, but it would have been offended if there weren't, if I was going to do a really good job on it. That's sort of what you want, rather than, like, what you'll pay me to do this thing. Like, sure, I'll pretend to do this.
01:04:07.574 - 01:04:56.554, Speaker F: And I have to agree with actually quite a lot what Michael said about the execution, especially in terms of security, because it's really easy to deploy things. But then again, I think most of our time is spent roughly reviewing things and reviewing, like, after auditors and before them and during them. So kind of like, the people we trust most is our team internally. And that is the difficult part. And that is probably why, especially, like, when. When your tv all starts to grow, the more it grows, the slower the development gets, even if you add more resources. It's just like, the stakes are so high that it just requires more measures.
01:04:57.654 - 01:05:14.994, Speaker E: Yeah, I would say that with regards to safety of things, I would once Samsung jokingly said, you know how I make safe, smart contracts? I just don't write smart contracts.
01:05:21.774 - 01:06:23.242, Speaker A: One thing I'll say we found, I mean, in addition to all the obvious things, is if you don't really deeply understand the thing you're building and why you're building it, why people are using it, you're not going to understand how to make it safe. Right? Like, you're going to spend all this time on all these things that you think are safety, and then you're going to have, like, a completely fucked up collateral factor or something like that, and it's like the whole thing goes boom and you're like, yeah, you know, or, you know, liquidation. Yeah, yeah, we let people get within, like, you know, ten bits of bankruptcy before you start, you know, liquidating them on Ethereum. It's like, no, obviously that's going to fail. Like, that was your security bug, and it's like, enormous and obviously going to fail. And there's just so many things like that that if you don't have an intuition going into it for, like, what you should be looking out for, like, you might even find all the, like, bugs, like, all the code that won't compile or, like, code that will literally not do the actions you intended, but, like, you might, you're probably not going to find all of the mis parameterization, and I think harvest is a great example of that. Right.
01:06:23.242 - 01:06:38.726, Speaker A: It's not that the code did something really different than they expected it to. They just never thought hard about, like, what if someone stressed it in this economic way? Would that be catastrophically bad? The answer is, yeah, it would. Yeah.
01:06:38.726 - 01:06:41.814, Speaker C: For picking parameters is be such a hard problem.
01:06:41.894 - 01:06:57.870, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. It's what cost $300 million of clawbacks in 2018 for drivers exchanges in crypto. Just all, like, they just choose the wrong parameters for things. Just like you look and like you or tree you look. That one's wrong. I hate the.
01:06:57.870 - 01:06:59.514, Speaker A: Definitely be clawbacks there.
01:07:02.814 - 01:07:21.284, Speaker C: Yeah. I think Astani, I think that was you in the conversation that said that, like, people make money by understanding risk. Like, if you have, like, a really insight about, like, the risk of the system, then that's where you can actually get alpha.
01:07:21.704 - 01:08:08.450, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing. Like, the most hardest thing about our system is actually the risk. Like, the risk assessment. And especially when you, when you're dealing with lending and borrowing collaterals, that is where the hard part comes, because you're, you're. You're basically adding assets when the market is going up, but then you have to ensure that when, when the shit goes down, like, the liquidations and everything works, you know, and you don't have this kind of, like, cascading events, and, and this is basically what, what happened in the makerdao system, and that was bought because you could actually plays zero bits on the liquidations, which was problematic. And that is very hard. Like, how do you model risk? And it's not easy.
01:08:08.450 - 01:08:35.546, Speaker F: Even in Aaver, we have an actuary and risk department and so forth, and also a bunch of other stuff that we are using as tools. It's really difficult. And with this kind of assets that are quite new and traded, so weird places and less weird places. And you have, like, decentralized ecosystem as well. It's not the easiest part, I would say.
01:08:35.610 - 01:08:51.414, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's not. Maker is also a fucking time, though. I mean, I mean, thinking a lot of people staring at it for years, like, if he scratches, that thing's definitely going under. Like, it was sort of a matter of when, not if.
01:08:54.034 - 01:09:18.627, Speaker C: All right. Yeah, yeah, no, go ahead. If you guys want to keep going. Yeah, we can close this thing down. I almost, like, think that, like, part of this, like, laissez faire thing with economics comes from us. A ton of the space being built by engineers first and finance people second. Is that, like, you know, like, who cares what the, what, like the, you know, what I set? Like, the.
01:09:18.627 - 01:09:45.458, Speaker C: How many milliseconds a scheduler takes to switch processes in Linux. So it'll be slow for some people to fast for others. Right. It's. It's not like a, it's not like a big deal, right? Like, this stuff, when you start building these, like, higher levels of financial instruments, like, that's when things get scary and, like, I don't have the personal experience to have that intuition. Right. And it's worth a lot.
01:09:45.506 - 01:10:06.714, Speaker A: I mean, it's. I can say we get a ton of people saying, hey, do you want to do something with our protocol? Just like a 90% like that? That's not going to work. It's not going to work. I mean, just know it won't. It's very far from working. And I think. I do think that the space has actually done a pretty decent job of, like, the ones that have floated to the top are the ones that, like, work.
01:10:06.714 - 01:10:37.844, Speaker A: And it's probably not a coincidence. Like, I don't think that, like, you know, Michael or stunny are, like, shocked that their protocols worked. I'm guessing they, like, put thought into it and had, like, relevant experts and probably had decent instincts themselves on it, but, you know, and obviously Tegan. But I think that's sort of a given because, like, the graph doesn't get this sort of freebie of, like, you're building everything on chain so people give you a pass if your product is stupid and doesn't work. Like, your product always had to work to get traction. So.
01:10:41.694 - 01:10:44.454, Speaker C: Cool. All right, awesome. Yeah.
01:10:44.494 - 01:10:49.918, Speaker B: I'm going to just start, like, extending the duration of these events, like, 30 minutes out and all the invites just.
01:10:49.966 - 01:10:51.582, Speaker C: To be safe moving forward.
01:10:51.758 - 01:10:53.798, Speaker B: This is, this was amazing.
01:10:53.966 - 01:10:54.494, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:10:54.534 - 01:10:57.526, Speaker B: Thank you, Tegan, for joining. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Stani.
01:10:57.590 - 01:10:58.094, Speaker C: Thank you, Sam.
