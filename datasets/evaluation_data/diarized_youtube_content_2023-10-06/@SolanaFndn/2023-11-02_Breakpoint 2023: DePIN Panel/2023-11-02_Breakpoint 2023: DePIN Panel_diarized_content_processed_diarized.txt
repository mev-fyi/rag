00:00:01.160 - 00:00:42.364, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone, for making it out here. I'm super excited to be sitting with two people who are in the proverbial arena building sort of the building businesses in what I think is one of the most interesting categories of crypto businesses today, deep ins. And so we can kick things off with an introduction as soon as that goes out. But, yeah, I'm Shayan. I'm a partner on the investment team at Multicoin. I spend a lot of time looking at deepen networks, and we're going to have a good amount of time to go into the basics and kind of dive into broader mechanics and why they are only possible on Solana. But I'll give Paul and Noah a minute to introduce themselves, and we'll jump right in.
00:00:43.664 - 00:01:12.002, Speaker B: Cole. Hey, I'm Paul. I'm the founder of Teleport. Teleport is a ride share application for an open protocol called the Rideshare Protocol. Our goal is to bring about a renaissance where there's more open protocols. If you think about things right now as they stand, you have email, you have the web, but then there's a lot of companies that have closed protocols. What that means for specifically rideshare right now, you might call a ride.
00:01:12.002 - 00:01:33.624, Speaker B: You pay dollar 59, the driver receives dollar 16, because for monopolies, there's no incentive to pay the driver more. Right. If they charge the customer $20 more, the driver doesn't get $20 more. So we do two things different. We're built on an open protocol. It's called the Rideshare protocol. You can learn about it on trip dot de V Dot.
00:01:33.624 - 00:02:10.314, Speaker B: That means there's real market competition in the system. And the second thing we do with different is instead of spending billions of dollars on acquiring drivers and riders, we allow the drivers to invite each other. We call this proof of revenue. That means if you are bringing drivers and riders to the network, you balance supply and demands. You are getting network rewards by the rideshare protocol. You can learn more about it on Trip Dot de V, or you can go to teleport XYZ and download our app. We are in the iOS App Store right now, and we are about to launch our first city in the United States early next year.
00:02:10.934 - 00:02:12.434, Speaker C: Any alpha in which city?
00:02:13.744 - 00:02:45.364, Speaker B: We're probably going to run a competition between different places, because what you need to launch a city is you need an atomic network of enough drivers, enough riders. You're not going to have a good experience if there's one driver, but actually you need about one driver per square mile. So if you think about a place like San Francisco. I used to live there for ten years. That's about 46 drivers. Cruz had like 50 drivers with their self driving cars. That doesn't sound like as big of a number.
00:02:45.364 - 00:03:03.564, Speaker B: So, yeah, we're working out the exact details, but it's probably going to be an invite competition. And if you want to get ahead on that, you can download the app right now, you can start inviting people. And if your city is the first city where we get enough people, your city is going to launch first.
00:03:03.984 - 00:03:19.184, Speaker C: Nice. Very nice. Yeah. I'm Noah Prince. I'm the head of protocol engineering at Helium foundation. So helium is probably one of the first deepen projects. I don't know if we were the first, but it's got to be close.
00:03:21.044 - 00:03:22.932, Speaker A: You can say it, you can wear it as a badge.
00:03:22.988 - 00:04:05.522, Speaker C: Call first. In fact, we were so early that we had to build our own l one. But helium was this idea that founders wanted to coat the world in Internet coverage. And similar to most dpins, that kind of has a chicken and egg problem of nobody wants to use a network that doesn't have coverage, but you've got to get the coverage first. So in a kind of similar way to teleport, anybody can just go buy commodity hardware, they can buy hotspots and basically become their own cell phone tower. And so you do that, you mine tokens, and then anybody can use it for now, a variety of things. Helium has become more than just one network.
00:04:05.522 - 00:04:29.318, Speaker C: It's actually a network of networks. So there's a mobile 5G everything plan in Miami for only $5 a month, which is insane, but also the lowest or the highest coverage lower on network in the entire world, which is used to power everything from smart cities to smart farms. You know, basically everything in the Internet of things space.
00:04:29.486 - 00:04:35.694, Speaker B: It's $5 a month. I pay like 70, $80 a month on Verizon. How do you do the $5 a month?
00:04:35.814 - 00:05:24.624, Speaker C: I know, it's like insane. But, yeah, I've actually talked to people who work at these telcos, and, like, the way that they have to go about deploying things is super inefficient, especially for something like 5g where, like, your range is really low. For every single one they deploy, they have to go, like, negotiate with a landlord to get some square on their rooftop, and then they have to send somebody out there to put it up there. They have to have a legal team to write up the legal contracts to lease that land for however long. And they also have an oligopoly, so they can charge whatever they want, but it's also very expensive for them versus the landlord just sees like, oh, hey, helium is this really, really cool thing online. I'm already paying for Internet, I'm already paying for electricity. I just plug it in super easy.
00:05:25.444 - 00:06:12.714, Speaker A: Yeah, that's amazing. So we're going to get into all that. We have a good amount of time here. So I think it's good to start with just sort of table stakes around what deep ins are. I think the general idea for those of you who are not super familiar, these are physical infrastructure networks that are built out using token incentives across kind of distributed cohorts of people, people who are purchasing or building out infrastructure in different parts of the world and being rewarded for their contributions to a global network through tokens. I think in a time where there are always questions about what crypto is useful for, what is uniquely enabled by this primitive, this permissionless money, I think deepens present a very compelling answer to things that are net new. And you look at the sort of businesses that, that Paul and Noah are building.
00:06:12.714 - 00:07:09.734, Speaker A: Helium is going after massive telcos with huge regular capture, massive amounts of strength in the market. As it stands today, you guys are going after the ubers of the world and the massive taxi unions that are aggregated and disaggregated in really interesting ways, but they're both behemoths in their own right and as sort of early stage teams, depending on how you define early stage, going after these markets is a very non trivial thing. And I think core to that is token incentives. Your businesses would not be possible without blockchains. I think maybe it's helpful to start with what tokens have done for you and how you see them playing a role in what you're building and how you think of that capital formation mechanism as a whole in terms of what is uniquely enabled by the model itself.
00:07:10.514 - 00:07:53.018, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's like a real David and Goliath situation with these giant companies, but it's not really like David with a single sling. It's like hundreds of thousands of davids with slings starring rocks at Goliath. Right. And that's what tokens enable. Right. You could surely have people deploy hotspots and then just pay them in USDC, but at that point, they have absolutely no ownership in the network, and that's not really fair. The other thing about these is the person who deploys the very, very first hotspot is taking a lot more risk than the person who deploys, say, the millionth hotspot, because when you've deployed the millionth hotspot, there's coverage all around the world.
00:07:53.018 - 00:08:30.172, Speaker C: There's very likely to be people that are using the network. But when you deploy that first hotspot, nobody knows that anybody's going to use the network because it doesn't have the coverage right now. And so tokens, they level this playing field. And specifically, helium works on a halving schedule. So the people who built the network early had more incentive to do so and take that risk on. And that kind of enables a flywheel that allows these networks to get built incredibly fast. In fact, I don't know if I've ever seen a hardware rollout as widely successful as helium's iot network.
00:08:30.172 - 00:08:45.664, Speaker C: I mean it's just, and it's like not just in the US, it's like literally everywhere. If you look at a coverage map, it's just like green as far as the eye can see. I've just not in my life seen anything else. I can do that in like a short period of time.
00:08:48.204 - 00:09:28.130, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the civilization as a whole, right, is coordinating people to do things together. It doesn't, it's not, you know, one person doing one thing. Civilization is a multiplayer game at heart. And to build anything that's big and able to. This is a great essay. I know many of you probably have read this essay about, you know, the pencil, like how hard it is to make a single pencil. How much of, you know, like you need to go out, you need to find the graphite, you need to refine it, the coloring, all the refinement, the tools to cut down, the tools to mine for the materials.
00:09:28.130 - 00:10:15.270, Speaker B: You need like a single person, maybe in a couple of decades they could make a pencil. Instead we make them for dirt cheap all the time. So civilization is about coordination. And I think at various points in society we come up with new tools to coordinate better and it allows us to achieve bigger things. We're also developing new materials. Those new materials allow us to build specific machines or they build specific things, but the underlying substrate of civilization is the ability to coordinate. I think why we are all here and why there's such a large movement in crypto right now is because people have realized some of our institutions have started failing us.
00:10:15.270 - 00:10:59.498, Speaker B: They're not working as efficient as they could be. And, you know, we can question the things. We can look that up in private industry, we can look at it in government in other parts. But, you know, it's this question, does docusign need 7000 engineers to make a software where you can basically, you know, into your name and make a digital signature. Do you need 7000 people for that? Does Uber need 33,000 employees and $2.5 billion a year in fixed cost just to finance their operations? And that's only 20% of their total cost. 80% of the cost is variable.
00:10:59.498 - 00:11:42.654, Speaker B: So you end up with this really weird situation where a driver works for a living to feed his family, pay rent, send his kids to college, that driver on a $59 ride makes $16. Quite often you can ask yourself, is this the most efficient way to organize a society? And I think we're reaching the point where the answer is no. But to get change, we need to. To coordinate people. Because if I propose a more. A better solution to run this, everyone's going to be, yes, but all the users are already on this existing solution. No one's ever going to switch over.
00:11:42.654 - 00:12:39.678, Speaker B: And partially the reason why we believe this so strongly is because of a marketing campaign by venture capitalists and founders during the first dot bubble, where everyone was saying, first mover advantage, network effects, Metcalfe's law, you know, basically the first to come along and do something, you can never unseat them. The question I want to propose is that actually true? Because Netflix started only twelve years after blockbuster, and it actually managed to unseat them very quickly. It's about 13 ish years after Uber cap, as it was initially called. Uber started giving rides in San Francisco and Uber has become the new taxi industry. Right. And it's not good for the drivers, it's not good for the riders. I think we can unseat them.
00:12:39.678 - 00:13:13.454, Speaker B: So I think with helium, with teleport, and I think we're going to see a lot more deep in protocols. We already see a lot of them. Cheyenne probably knows a lot of them popping up. There's really an opportunity to do away with this myth that companies that don't serve their customers have an indefensible mode. I think there's a defensible mode as long as humans can coordinate and you can reward the early adopters who make the transition. We're turning that step function. Everyone needs to switch at once into the early adopters, get rewarded, and it becomes a gradient.
00:13:14.174 - 00:13:57.464, Speaker A: So let's dive into that. Paul. I mean, you paint this super idealistic version of the world, which I'm a super optimist, I'm fully on board with, and so let's get into it. Counter positioning against this sort of behemoth, centralized incumbent, the big, bad, rent seeking Ubers of the world. And in whatever categories, right, where you have this sort of central pricing model, a lack of flexibility, a lack of ownership, a lack of general alignment across the people who are providing the thing that's valuable to the network, the car and the driver, and them sort of sitting out of the equation and being limited in their options for what they can get out of that. You sort of, with your open wide arms, are saying, come to me. We'll fix this.
00:13:57.464 - 00:14:33.104, Speaker A: We've seen people try to compete with a business like Uber 100 times over the last ten years. There are certain things that people have in mind around what it takes to do that correctly, and certain sort of minimum thresholds in terms of a service that needs to be provided sustainably. In your head, what are those components? What do you need to get right in order to start taking them on directly? And what are the things that you think about in designing your business that allow you to counter position against that business?
00:14:33.604 - 00:15:18.982, Speaker B: That's a great question. I think it's easy to become cynical when something has been tried many times, but it doesn't mean it doesn't work. It means you don't understand how it's going to work sometimes. Not for everything, obviously, but I think of the world kind of like this big puzzle of where you have to figure out the order in which things happen, right? Like, when does something get cheap? What's the effect of having a gyroscope in every phone? Suddenly they get really cheap. Now you have drones. We wouldn't have drones if we hadn't had cell phones first. We wouldn't have AI to the same degree if we hadn't had GPU's for video games first.
00:15:18.982 - 00:16:10.890, Speaker B: It's really interesting to untangle this puzzle. But when a bunch of things get ready, there's this period of usually a couple of years where people don't understand that something traumatic has shifted, and then suddenly something crazy happens, right? I like to go to history. I love reading about history because you see all these examples, right? When the mongol empire invented accounting, they became large because they couldn't manage a large empire, because they invented the accounting system. So I think what has happened when Satoshi uncovered one, how to build a decentralized protocol. He didn't only uncover how to build a decentralized protocol. He also found a way to reward the early adopters, and that's this transition function. What you need is a good idea of a better end state people can believe in.
00:16:10.890 - 00:17:28.893, Speaker B: And then you need a way to coordinate human behavior so that selfish interest and the interest of having a better system for the community is aligned. And then when you have lots of actors, and I'm a distributed systems engineer by trade, right? I used to work at Dropbox. I built their peer to peer protocol. I'm an engineer, and what I realized is what you do in distributed systems, in peer to peer protocol design, in agent based modeling, you think about how do you get emergent behavior on the level of, like, a cloud of actors that emerges from the selfish behavior of the individuals? And so coordination is essentially just setting incentives and rewards where I can achieve a goal of unlocking a city and then receiving rewards, because we are the first city in the world where teleport is live, the drivers get paid more, the riders pay less, and the early adopters in that city get all the rewards. It's like, almost like you're the only city in the world where you can mine bitcoin. It's like Helfini, Satoshi, and you in your city. Every other city in the world is suddenly gonna think, oh, shit, why does CDX.
00:17:28.893 - 00:17:55.156, Speaker B: No, the question was, good, which is the first city? But that's the question going to be, why does that city, why is that the only place where I can currently get these network rewards from the rideshare protocol, and they're going to push hard to coordinate locally to launch the next city once we have two cities launched. Oh, my God, this can go very, very fast. And that's just like what you've seen with Helio. These things go slow, slow, slow, slow. And then they explode.
00:17:55.300 - 00:17:55.860, Speaker A: Yep.
00:17:55.972 - 00:17:57.140, Speaker C: Slowly, then all at once.
00:17:57.212 - 00:17:57.508, Speaker B: Yep.
00:17:57.556 - 00:17:59.784, Speaker C: Actually been fun to watch it happen in Miami.
00:18:00.124 - 00:18:42.104, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, I think that coordination problem that you described, Paul, is at the heart of every single one of these businesses. Right? Like, that's truly what is sort of programmatically changing in the structure of these businesses. I mean, helium, for instance, right? Like, it started off as this IoT coverage network for Lorawan, right? Like low range kind of. These are sort of dog collars and sensors. The type of signal, the type of network that was being built out to prove that capital formation mechanism was for a very specific use case. Having transitioned to mobile coverage now, you had to take that core principle, but build it on top of the same network.
00:18:42.104 - 00:19:32.762, Speaker A: It's still h and t as an asset. And there are some. It's not easy moving from a specific type of coverage to now a full open protocol to define net new forms of coverage, whether it's Wi Fi or cellular or 5g or whatever it is. Right? Noah, how has that transition been over the last two years as mobile and 5g have come on, moving the core stakeholder base away from that initial hotspot owner in early 2018 to 19, setting up 20 hotspots in their city and mining these tokens all the way to picking up small cells and establishing them in strategic parts of the city and providing coverage. What is that transition been like? How have you had to manage incentives across that network with different forms of hardware, different networks, what has that process been like over the last couple of years?
00:19:32.938 - 00:20:22.370, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting because when you think about how you deploy a 5g network, it is just completely different than a LoRaWAN network. So for people not familiar with these things, LoRaWAN is this super, super far range, low power signal. So, like, you know, these hotspots can go 10 km, but people have even seen them go hundreds of kilometers. And sensors that are using these networks are really low powered. So you can have a sensor on your farm that lasts for, like, ten years. If you were to try and, you know, put like, a, you know, mobile phone battery in that and, like, have it connect to the mobile network, it might last a week. And so, like, the deployment for these is you can truly get coverage everywhere, but you don't need 40 hotspots in one place.
00:20:22.370 - 00:20:48.606, Speaker C: You want them really kind of well distributed. And then 5G is almost the opposite of this. Right. Helium mobile just recently came out with Wi Fi hotspots. And from your homes, Wifi hotspots have a pretty short range. But the idea is that most of the people who are using the networks are in these highly populated areas. They're in a sports stadium, they're in a shopping mall, they're at the cafe.
00:20:48.606 - 00:21:49.290, Speaker C: And so you want to concentrate coverage in these areas because you have kind of a limited range. And so that's been kind of one of the bigger transitions. And so we've started to see really cool innovations come out of this, like this thing called hexboosting, which is a really cool name, but it basically just means, hey, if you go deploy in this area where we know there are tons of people using the network, you're going to earn a lot more tokens. And then kind of seeing as you create these incentive structures, how humanity just kind of rallies around it, it's not like we're going and hiring someone to deploy it. It's just like some guy, and he's like, actually, I know a bunch of people at this university. I know a few of the, like, cafe owners, and I can go get them to deploy a hotspot. And I also know a bunch of students that will pay, you know, will be willing to do $5 a month for this plan because, like, it's expensive existing nowadays and helium is kind of doing it all.
00:21:49.290 - 00:22:43.524, Speaker C: And the, you know, the engineering and the tokenomics behind it is also just has been super crazy because you kind of go from the system of one, two tokens, if you consider like, data credits a token to, you know, now we have, you know, three tokens plus data credits, that's four. And then, you know, we took the old l one and shoved it into Solana. And so now you have Sol. And, yeah, it's just kind of pushing the bounds of the way people understand crypto because, like, you know, a lot of these people, it's their first time in crypto and you're like, not just one token, but there's like five. So that, you know, that's been the problem that we're working on, but it's still very much working. And it's cool to see how these two different networks operate very differently, but it's still the same idea.
00:22:44.224 - 00:23:22.024, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's get into that. I think we've established at this point that these businesses are only possible with crypto. Let's talk about why they're only possible on Solana with helium. There was, like you mentioned the original h and t token, and then there were data credits, and now there's mobile, there's iot, there's potentially net new tokens. How does all of this stuff come together? And I want you to tell the story about how you got involved with helium in the first place and how that initial build out started as well. Because that structure and that incentive mechanism at the scale at which it's happening seems to be only possible on Solana. And so let's talk a little bit about that.
00:23:22.184 - 00:24:02.344, Speaker C: Yeah, last year is really interesting. So originally I founded a company on Solana called Strata. We built a product called Wumbo, which was involved with social tokens. And as one usually does with startups, you kind of end up pivoting back ass words into what you probably should have been building. And so we realized in building social tokens that we actually just made something to make it really, really easy to launch tokens in general. And we had come up with a unique way of doing bonding curves such that the prices weren't so static. You could actually have the amount of tokens in supply.
00:24:02.344 - 00:24:39.318, Speaker C: Some of them get burned, for example, and the price would actually adjust. And so I'm sure you're thinking, what does this have to do with helium? Helium actually had a very similar mechanism that they wanted to use for how the subdal tokens relate to the main token. You have to have some kind of bonding between these two things. So there was a little bit of overlap with strata. And then helium was trying to do something insane that no one had ever done. I still remember the first caller. We're going to shove a blockchain into another blockchain.
00:24:39.318 - 00:25:18.184, Speaker C: It's like you're doing what now? But, yeah, I mean, I think I started in October. We did the migration in like April, which is just absurd. The timeline on this was crazy. And like, the other kind of cool thing that happened with this was, you know, you talk about only possible on Solana. There were a lot of things that were just like, too hard to build on the old l one. Enshrining something in l one is a lot harder than enshrining in smart contracts, obviously. So there were all these grand, lofty ideas.
00:25:18.184 - 00:25:59.612, Speaker C: If you've never looked at the helium improvement proposals repository, the hips, they're great and they're so detailed and it's basically like a history of the network and all the decisions. And there's just a backlog of, like, here are all these amazing ideas that we want to implement. We want these sub networks, we want v token voting, we want this, we want that. And it was like, we'll just wait till Salada, we'll wait till Solana, and then we'll build it all. And we did. We actually managed to get most of these things out the door by the migration and then the rest of it probably within the next, like the following three months. It was just like an insane engineering offer at like multiple organizations.
00:25:59.612 - 00:26:10.764, Speaker C: There's helium foundation, there's Nova labs, there's like dozens and dozens of manufacturers that build these hotspots. The coordination on this was just insane.
00:26:11.744 - 00:26:54.418, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it really speaks to sort of the limitations and the constraints of the tech, as in other configurations, of how you would build these systems and how you can kind of get around some of that through basic primitives on Solana that have already been built. Right. I think when I talk to a lot of people who are building consumer products in crypto, I'm always the guy in the corner shouting. Deepin is consumer. Your stakeholders are regular people, your supply side, your demand side. These are people who in some cases don't need to know that they're interacting with the chain. And so you want to make that as simple, as smooth as fast, as cheap as possible, and if you're rolling your own configuration, you're rolling your own stack.
00:26:54.418 - 00:27:34.176, Speaker A: You are dealing with new forms of abstracting away all of the stuff that's behind the chain. You want to have primitives that make that easy. In your case, Paul, your stakeholders are drivers and riders. These are not people who in some cases want to know what tokens are. They don't want to handle keys, they don't want to handle custody. How do you think about designing an application that is, you know, that crypto and tokens are so core to and yet messaging that and making sure that it's accessible to a cohort of people that may not want to have anything to do with them, but still understand the merits and the value behind the system?
00:27:34.240 - 00:27:57.166, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's not an easy thing. I think we. For the longest time, for the longest time, you couldn't built on crypto because crypto didn't exist. Right. Like there was proof that the byzantine general's problem couldn't be solved. You can't reach agreement decentralized systems. Satoshi solved that.
00:27:57.166 - 00:28:36.122, Speaker B: That kind of kicked us off with proof of work. So many interesting results have come from that, like, not just in cryptography, but in economics and so many different areas. But I think where we're at now is technology is not the problem. You can actually build really cool stuff. And I sometimes hear people complain all rust is hard and this and that, but people used to write games in machine code or directly arcade consoles, not even in circuits. If tech is your problem, you don't have a problem. So the interesting thing now becomes, it's true though, right?
00:28:36.178 - 00:28:37.174, Speaker C: That's a great take.
00:28:37.654 - 00:29:11.176, Speaker B: If tech is your problem, you don't have a problem at this point. So now the question actually becomes a little bit more, what do you actually, how do you get users? How do you make it user friendly? And my background, actually, I think the reason I'm doing this, I worked on consumer products. I built Austria's largest food delivery company and sold it before coming to the states. I worked on Dropbox with employee eleven over there. And we did two things right. We built a product that was better than anything out there competing with the giants. Steve Jobs wanted to buy us.
00:29:11.176 - 00:29:39.266, Speaker B: And I remember Drew Houston coming to the team, and we were working late. So, like, after a whole day at the Apple campus, he told us he turned him down. That was insane. I worked on the peer to peer protocol over there. This was 2010, and I've worked on crypto early on. And so I've kind of been like there was a consumer. By the way, Dropbox was a consumer application that was really, really good, really hidden from the user.
00:29:39.266 - 00:30:14.634, Speaker B: We were trying to have almost no interaction. We injected code into the running Mac finder because it didn't have an API for making like, icon overlays. Really good product, but no one would have ever heard about us unless we also did another thing. We invented two gigabyte for you. Drew invented two gigabyte for you, two gigabyte for me, if I invite people. So I think what's lacking in crypto and what Satoshi was not lacking is this coordination mechanism of rewarding people who actually bring users to the system. Distribution, distribution, distribution.
00:30:14.634 - 00:30:42.960, Speaker B: The product was better than anything out there. Google Drive didn't even make it out of the door for the longest time. They couldn't name the competitors of the time because no one's going to remember their names anyway. Dropbox slaughtered that space. I think what's necessary when I think about this, I need easy onboarding. Ride sharing is fantastic because you can pay with credit card for a ride, which means onboarding, but I can still give the driver USDC. The driver is already background checked.
00:30:42.960 - 00:31:11.980, Speaker B: Now, we can actually withdraw with that background check to his bank account, or he can spend with Solana pay. And I know a lot of people here are working on this. So we're onboarding potentially hundreds of millions of people into the Solana ecosystem. So that's one part. For that to be possible, we can't have high transaction fees. Things need to be fast. So I see our job as mass onboarding people into Solana.
00:31:11.980 - 00:31:45.416, Speaker B: And then also you have to think about ride share. According to McKinsey, might be an 800 billion a year revenue industry. Other estimates are like around 200, 8300 billion. So let's be conservative, say 300 billion a year. That's almost bitcoin's entire market cap every year. Going through rideshare now, imagine that getting onboarded and being transactions with something like circle USDC on the Solana network. That could be the beginning of turning Solana into the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.
00:31:45.416 - 00:32:16.732, Speaker B: I mean, that's just one protocol for one function, right? That's just one thing. That's what we're building other people. You all will build other things. I think that's very powerful. And also the composability of all of that. That is possible. If there's one protocol like that, I think we have to change our notion of what money or value exchange change actually is, because if that's cheap and composable and Noah wants to be paid in, I don't know, tomato futures.
00:32:16.732 - 00:33:01.862, Speaker B: And all I have is, let's say, apple stock. As long as there's someone who can provide liquidity to translate that. He doesn't even need to know I pay using Apple stock and he receives tomato futures. So this is the future I see. We're building on Solana because I think composability matters, speed matters, price matters, and having high availability of all the infrastructure, like really cheap nfts with the compressed nfts and state compression matters. Having the highest USDC or stablecoin liquidity outside of Ethereum, which is too expensive to build on, higher than any of the ethereum. L two s.
00:33:01.862 - 00:33:27.762, Speaker B: So that's what led us to build on Solana. It's just a really good ecosystem. But if we bring this to Solana, it also means for us, other people can then build Solana pay, other people can build things like Phoenix and Orca, Jupiter, all the other Emms and order books to us. That is exciting to bring liquidity to something that we can then build on top of with other people.
00:33:27.958 - 00:33:38.002, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's like it's permissionless financial markets for net new forms of value. And with access that is completely unrestricted, it's a really appealing vision.
00:33:38.138 - 00:34:16.634, Speaker C: The composability of this is going to get really interesting. You're effectively making humans more useful because a lot of the things in deepen are kind of. You were already doing that, right? Like, you were already paying for Internet and you already had electricity, so you, you put up a hotspot, you are already driving for teleport, earning tokens, and you put a hive map or dashcam in your car, and now you're mapping the road and you're just like earning tokens for that. Now you're more useful. But even then you could have your mobile phone in your pocket. That's on the helium mobile plan, that's mapping the network and telling helium where they should be deploying hotspots. You get tokens for that too.
00:34:16.634 - 00:34:33.794, Speaker C: You could throw a demo in your car and be earning tokens for that too. And then these things start to compose together because I'm going to take the tokens that I earned on teleport and now use them to pay for my phone plan on helium. It's just like the world's going to be really, really crazy in like ten years.
00:34:34.254 - 00:35:01.994, Speaker A: Totally. I mean, I think Paul, I think the Dropbox example is super pertinent. Right? Like, it's sort of the defining feature of these platforms, these marketplaces, to give away value as an exercise in user acquisition. Right. And historically, that's been in the form of credits or coupons or it's sort of proxy, it's value, but it's never ownership, it's never stake. That's never really been possible to deliver. And that's the unlock that a lot of these networks offer.
00:35:01.994 - 00:35:54.526, Speaker A: And I think one of the emergent things around that is that you now have 2 million people in the world who hold HNT, who have earned this and mined this much. And part of it, that's a community, that's a net new people, that's a coalition, that's a network state, quote unquote. In some ways we can get into that later. But how do you think of that softer social layer? These are part owners in your business. They are in some ways on your cap table, and then they should be because they are providing the value there. How do you think of community? What sort of primitives, crypto primitives specifically, do you use to coordinate things within the community itself? And what is the value of having kind of this distributed set of stakeholders that is owning and running this business that you are also creating?
00:35:54.670 - 00:36:33.954, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the guys on the previous panel were speaking a lot to this, but the social consensus layer is extremely important. Helium didn't just go from a single network to a network of networks in a vacuum. The community voted. Helium is probably one of the biggest daos. And so with that, we see some of the largest kind of coordination problems, like dao tooling is a really, really hard problem. And how do you get people to turn out to vote is something that we're really thinking hard about. Helium has really, really good participation for a Dao.
00:36:33.954 - 00:37:14.924, Speaker C: But when you think about, like, how many people go vote in the United States, a lot of times it's like 40, 50%, which we see that and we're like, oh my God, half the people aren't voting. But I see that and I'm like, oh my God, half the people are voting. And like, their daos are nowhere close to that, which is a problem, right. Because then it becomes easier to, you know, maliciously take over a vote. And so, you know, we're looking from a technology perspective at a lot of things. Recursive delegation is potentially interesting. I delegate to my friend because he knows more about helium, and then he delegates to, you know, Chris, because Chris knows everything about helium.
00:37:14.924 - 00:38:16.494, Speaker C: That kind of thing can maybe help voter turnout, radically decreasing the cost of vote, which already on Solana, it's a lot cheaper. I think on the helium l one, it was like thirty cents to vote. On Solana it's way cheaper. But I'm thinking, how can I make it free? How can I use generic account compression to make it just free to vote? And then things like confidential voting, which are incredibly complicated too, are people not voting because they're scared people are going to see what they voted for? You know, all these things are, you know, we are super, super focused on how we get more people to vote because these are, you know, this community, you can maybe call it like dog fooding or your customers, but they're not really customers, they're your community. And like, the more feedback you get from them, the better the network is going to be, because who knows best what the network needs other than like, the people that are doing it? So, yeah, very excited about the kind of governance side of things.
00:38:18.194 - 00:38:52.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely, I completely agree. That part is extremely interesting to me. And I kind of see this like, as a, as a lab. I mean, people, you know, when you're in the middle of it, you don't see it, but we're literally building some of the infrastructure that other people are building on top of to build civilization. Right. I mean, that's what we're doing here. I know that's very, you know, patting ourselves on the back, but, you know, other people, you know, they work on hardware and I think that's really impressive.
00:38:52.038 - 00:39:32.048, Speaker B: That's not what I do. What we do here is we work on the incentives that build a cohesive civilization, that allow other people to build hardware. Right. You need different, that's what humans do. We specialize in different parts, but these incentives and these tools and voting technology, that's big. And I think, I mean, you know, like, I want to go and just, there is technology like voting, but there's things like Horto organizer society, like, you know, what the founding fathers did, accounting systems, writing, all of these tools are ways to coordinate us and they make a difference. And I think people, crypto goes through its cycles, and some people are only there during the fair weather.
00:39:32.048 - 00:39:44.684, Speaker B: I think we're getting back into a fair weather period. But really, whether fair weather or bear markets, we're building something that is actually going to deeply, deeply matter here. That's my take on it.
00:39:46.504 - 00:40:03.812, Speaker A: So a lot of what you guys have built is out in the wild today, right? It's live, it's market. People are playing around with it. What does the world look like in twelve and 36 months? The ideal state of the world for both your networks. Just paint an idealistic picture for us.
00:40:03.908 - 00:40:50.912, Speaker C: Twelve to 16 months. What I want to get built a lot of stuff. Everything I just mentioned about governance, I want to completely decentralize the system. One of the very hard things about helium that I don't think most people realize is the scale at which it's on operating is kind of like an AWS scale. Like you've got hundreds of thousands of hotspots and millions of sensors, all of them screaming into not the void, screaming into real things that are collecting that data and deciding how we're going to reward people, tons of people on phones. It's a huge amount of data. It's enough that the fire hose obviously, like, was breaking our l one, which is why we moved to Solana.
00:40:50.912 - 00:41:18.476, Speaker C: But in doing that, you know, things like packet routing had to get moved off chain. And so I would love to see that stuff completely decentralized. Rewards, calculations. Completely decentralized. Like, how do you solve these big data problems in a completely decentralized way? So I want to see that. I obviously want to see the helium mobile bulb roll out, go just completely nationwide. And just like, I really want to make, like a map of this.
00:41:18.476 - 00:41:43.964, Speaker C: So you can see in a sped up timeline, like all of these deployers coming out of nowhere and deploying these wireless hotspots where people are using it. It's going to be like watching a board. It's going to be really cool. So, yeah, that's like, twelve to 24 months will be interesting. You talk like 10, 20, 20 years. I'm really interested to see what happens when we hit, like, the mint burn equilibrium point.
00:41:45.504 - 00:42:05.524, Speaker B: Just since we're running out of time. I want to launch cities and I want people to copy what we're doing and start new protocols based on the principles of the ride share protocol. Read the white paper, trip dev, and copy what we're doing. Build more protocols. Let's decentralize more protocols.
00:42:06.184 - 00:42:09.440, Speaker A: Amazing. I feel like we could be here for another 40 minutes, guys, but thanks so much for the time.
00:42:09.512 - 00:42:09.824, Speaker B: Thank you.
