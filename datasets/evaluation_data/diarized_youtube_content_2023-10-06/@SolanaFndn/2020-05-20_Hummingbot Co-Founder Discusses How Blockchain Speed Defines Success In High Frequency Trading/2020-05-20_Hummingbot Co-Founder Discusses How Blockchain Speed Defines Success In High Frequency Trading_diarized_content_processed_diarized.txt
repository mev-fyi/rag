00:00:03.400 - 00:01:10.604, Speaker A: I'm Carlo Las Marias, CoO and co founder of Hummingbah. We create free, open source market making trading software for the cryptocurrency market that trades on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. I think there's a really great opportunity to apply blockchain technology to modernize a lot of the traditional things that are done in the financial world and to do them much more efficiently. For example, things like sending a wire internationally can take several days in the traditional finance world, whereas in the blockchain space, it can take a matter of seconds. And why we're really excited to work with Solana is in our space, in high frequency trading, speed defines our success, so that's really important for what we do. And in the defi space, we've seen some traction, but we think there's a ceiling on how far we can get because of the speed of capabilities. For example, like for DeXs, Dexus simply can't compete with centralized exchanges, whereas Asus and ex Solana, if we can change that, we have the opportunity to apply blockchain for more mainstream use and adoption for a lot more things.
00:01:10.604 - 00:01:54.274, Speaker A: What's great about Solana is that we don't have to compromise, so we don't have to compromise between speed versus security. So Solana provides a solution where we have the full security and decentralized benefits of the blockchain with the speed that you need for high frequency trading. We're really excited to launch liquidity mining. So liquidity mining is our new platform that allows for decentralized and crowdsourced market making. What that allows users to do, the members of the Solana community can participate in market making and providing liquidity for Sol tokens. We think through liquidity mining, they'll be able to earn ten to 20% and possibly even multiples of that, so they'll earn more tokens for participating in our campaigns.
