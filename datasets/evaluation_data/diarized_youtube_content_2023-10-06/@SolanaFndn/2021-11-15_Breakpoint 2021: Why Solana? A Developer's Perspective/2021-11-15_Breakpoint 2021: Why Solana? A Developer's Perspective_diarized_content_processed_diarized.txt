00:00:19.640 - 00:00:50.056, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. It seems like everybody wanted to go get a nice, quick glimpse of Raj and Anatoly for the first time, so. But super excited to be here. This is actually crazy. Lots of us at Solana Labs have actually never met each other either. So we've been spending the past few days just hanging out and getting to know each other. And then yesterday, the registration kicked off, and it was really cool to start meeting the people that I thought wouldn't be as social as they actually are.
00:00:50.056 - 00:01:09.324, Speaker A: Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe it was just people aren't as antisocial as I thought in this space. So it's been pretty incredible. So welcome to Ysalana developer's perspective. When I was first asked to do this, I thought it was kind of weird. I was like, I'm the most biased person in this company to talk about Ysalana. That's actually part of my job.
00:01:09.324 - 00:01:40.970, Speaker A: So I decided to bring in kind of a little unique collection of people. We have Bartosz Lipinski, Solana Labs. Previously in the Tradfi, we have Irvin Cardena from openera. And then we have Ian and Dylan Macleano from Sabre. So I'm gonna let everybody do a brief little introduction against the wishes of Bailey in here. So we're gonna keep these short and we'll go ahead, Bartosz.
00:01:41.082 - 00:01:41.734, Speaker B: Sure.
00:01:43.314 - 00:01:58.644, Speaker C: Thanks for having me here, Bartosz. I've been on Salalam for about a year. I primarily focus on building apps on top of Solana, and before that I worked on trading systems instead of other financial institutions.
00:01:59.544 - 00:02:27.304, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you guys for having me here. I'm Ervin. I'm co founder of Opendype Technologies, and we're building Openera and a few other immersive reality tools and applications that leverage Solana blockchain. And previous to that, I founded a bitcoin startup back in 2012, worked at Goldman Sachs strategic blockchain technologies and a few other things across various blockchains that, you know, like Polkadot, Harmony, Polygon, and also receive grants from Chainlink and other projects.
00:02:28.244 - 00:02:52.284, Speaker D: Hey, guys, my name is Dylan. I'm working on Sabre, which is a decentralized exchange on Solana, focusing on stable swaps of assets. I was also working on Metaplex, which is the NFT protocol in Solana. Before that was working in fintech, worked as a product manager at Ohikoi, which is a crypto exchange, and before that was doing tokenized securities on Ethereum and.
00:02:52.364 - 00:03:09.184, Speaker E: Hi, I'm Ian. I was an EVM dev. Before this, I built a big amm on Celo called Ubaswap, and I was also working at a fintech company called Pipe. We were doing lending, but.
00:03:09.624 - 00:03:11.924, Speaker B: Yeah, cool.
00:03:12.344 - 00:04:11.372, Speaker A: Thank you, everybody. So I think we're just going to kick this off. I think one of the most, like, the number one thing I wanted to do with this, this is why I brought people like Ervin and Sabre, Ian and Dylan from Sabre, is because they come from different blockchains. The number one question kind of that came to my mind whenever I was putting this together, was that, like, what was the original kind of moment for each of you guys to propel you into diving into Solana? I know coming from trad five, Bartosz might have a little bit of a different situation here, but as blockchain developers, it seems that it's not always the easiest thing to change your mind and switch to something completely different. Obviously fast, cheap, secure, blah, blah, blah. But there's obviously lots of different nuances and reasons here. Bartosz, did you want to give an answer to this? Since you're from the traditional finance world?
00:04:11.508 - 00:04:52.574, Speaker C: I can just say why. I guess in general, from my perspective, I picked Solana instead of other blockchains. So primarily when I think about building trading systems like throughput and latency, and how quickly you can get out of the orders that you have in the market. And at that time, like at the specific time, usually it's around the cancellation is when the throughput and latency matters. I think we are still not there yet with getting an actual trat, five market makers migrating to Solana, but it's extremely important to have a plan how you would get there. And based on my talk with Alek Anatoly before I started, I believe it's possible.
00:04:54.034 - 00:05:17.154, Speaker A: Yeah, so we kind of talked before this, though, and I know Erwin was going to also mention some things around the traditional finance world, but how. How is, is Solana fast and efficient enough right now to run what Anatoly would basically say, running like the Nasdaq on Solana? Are we there yet to be able to do that?
00:05:20.014 - 00:05:20.894, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:05:21.054 - 00:05:24.462, Speaker A: Yeah, Ervin, so, like Artash, you're one.
00:05:24.478 - 00:05:27.194, Speaker B: Of the core developers, so chime in right after you.
00:05:27.814 - 00:06:27.074, Speaker C: Sure. I think from the cancellation perspective, it's tricky just because how you communicate with the validators, there's no easy way for the market makers to actually guarantee that their constellations will hit the specific time. So I think there's still a couple of things that need to happen. I think this startup called Jitta is thinking about it, how it could be approached and like, market makers that are building on Solana are thinking about it quite a bit as well, like Susquehanna and Chicago trading company. I think they are doing interesting things with the validators to figure out how they can actually get out of the markets, which is the most critical aspect, at least from my perspective, that people that are looking at, like, Nasdaq don't think about, because they're like. It's like executing orders, but executing orders is actually less important than canceling them.
00:06:27.894 - 00:07:10.554, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's a huge misconception around the blockchain world. I think every blockchain will pitch you saying we have a million TPS transactions per second, but in the world of finance, or overall, TPS is not the only thing that matters. It's fast finality, because, as Bartosz was saying, was that you want the transaction to have complete finality. You don't want to have uncertainty for milliseconds or a large number of seconds. And so I think we're getting there. But definitely, I would say from that angle that Solana is one of the blockchains that is pushing towards mainstream adoption for us, that was one of the key things when we spoke to Anatolian Raj, that was a key thing.
00:07:10.554 - 00:07:43.522, Speaker B: And so that's good and all. And I honestly asked, well, how are you going to achieve this? And they kind of gave us a rundown, and you guys already seen this happen and play it out. And so as you're building a product or you're a technologist, the technology itself matters, and it's. A lot of the technology is there, but also, how is the technology being adopted by the entire world? Because essentially, you're building a product and you want your product to be used across the entire world. And so that's one of the things that I would say, expanding upon what Bartosz say. Yeah.
00:07:43.578 - 00:08:02.222, Speaker A: So is that just circling back, since I kind of like. Like, distracted away from that? So what was the first, like, what brought you into as open air? Like, how did you jump from Polygon and all the other blockchains that you were working on, which the list is actually quite long, but to make the jump to Solana?
00:08:02.358 - 00:08:16.510, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, wag me, I think, you know, that's the term. Like, we're all gonna make it. I think we all have to be friends in this ecosystem. And, you know, firstly, my team and I, up and I, we work with a few different blockchains. So we're Polygon.
00:08:16.510 - 00:08:37.856, Speaker B: We love those guys. We love Harmony. I'm a substrate academy fellow, which is the framework for Polkadot. And also, I was part of Polka House. Shout out to them. And, you know, like, we decided to build a product early this year. And so we came up with Opendive, which focuses on immersive reality tech.
00:08:37.856 - 00:08:56.674, Speaker B: And we really wanted to bring our technology and connect it to blockchain and so on. So we were looking for this kind of home we had worked on. Like Chase mentioned, polio was one of them. Harmony did avalanche and stuff like that. And SVF pitched us Solana and serum. Serum over there. We love serum.
00:08:56.674 - 00:09:07.230, Speaker B: And so we were like, okay, we've done so many hackathons, so many projects, a few alphas. I was like, Sam was like, come check out the Defi hackathon. There were like two weeks left.
00:09:07.342 - 00:09:07.750, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:07.822 - 00:09:30.724, Speaker B: And so Sean, my co founder, and I were like, okay, do we want to do another hackathon? Because we had said, we're done with hackathons. Let's build for long term. We're like, fine, let's do it. We get there, and I would say that it was like, documentation was bad. Like a total bratosh was horrible. I was like, how do I get started? I had to review it. Paul X blog was there.
00:09:30.724 - 00:10:34.404, Speaker B: And so as someone who's trying to build a startup a product and going towards Dao, like I said, one of the core things is technology. What I truly valued when I learned about Solana and I talked to the team Tolly, was that they're trying to innovate outside of other blockchains, because if you look at the space, there's a whole bunch of EVM compatible blockchains. So what's the innovation there? Is it a minor tweak in terms of how the transactions are propagated? Is it the validator set? And so it's something completely different, right? And I would tell you that it takes a lot of grit to build something from scratch, right? Because you're jumping into the unknown. And so I personally been there, and my co founder, Shawn, we're trying to build, like, robots and stuff like that, and it's like, tough. And so I valued that tremendously. The other part that we also valued in Solana early on was that the ecosystem was growing and they had a plan on how to create these tools. So we came in there and we said, okay, so the wallets weren't there.
00:10:34.404 - 00:10:55.876, Speaker B: This is like Varche from a, right? And Varchar, we get them done. And so we assess this and stuff like that. And at the end, it was a combination of, I would say three things right. The technology, the ecosystem, the community is growing there. And there's one third one, which I'll leave it out there. But these are key things to look into when you come into Solana, or perhaps other ecosystems. Right.
00:10:55.876 - 00:11:02.566, Speaker B: Technology, ecosystem and community, how fast they're growing. And the third one is probably quite obvious, but I think I'd like to touch upon that later on.
00:11:02.630 - 00:11:47.044, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think the community aspect of it's like, obviously part of my job is to speak with developers. And, like, I started six months ago and, like, my DM's went from like five DM's a day to I probably wake up to about 80 a day. 90% of those are people, sometimes from FAANG developers being like, hey, I'm getting into this. Don't tell anybody, but, like, where do I get started? So, like, that community aspect is, it's actually been crazy for me to watch that happen. But I am super interested to hear from Dylan and Ian about what you guys were building on Celo and ETH, and all of a sudden you're on Solana. So how did that end up happening? Or what drew you to it?
00:11:47.664 - 00:11:51.344, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe it's easier, actually, if Ian goes first.
00:11:51.464 - 00:11:52.964, Speaker E: Me? Okay.
00:11:53.664 - 00:11:53.976, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:54.000 - 00:12:43.156, Speaker E: I mean, what drew us to Solana initially for building? I guess the curve of Solana was the low fees and the fast transaction time. So some more background on me. I've been involved in Defi for a long time, since the term came out. I guess in 2018, I was really involved in Ethereum defi trading since March 2020. So I saw the entire ecosystem grow from before yield farming when DeFi TbL was under a billion, to, I guess, where it is today. But yeah, from that curve was something that I used all the time, but it's very expensive because it's not like uniswap, where it's just x times Y equals k, which is already kind of expensive, but it's a little more complicated than that. And from that, you're easily spending maybe even like, dollar 50 per transaction as a cheap transaction to just swap between stables.
00:12:43.156 - 00:13:30.704, Speaker E: But curve is a really good idea. It's a LP, or it's like an exchange where you don't have any impermanent loss. It's like a good risk free rate of crypto, but we basically just wanted to have that, except cheaper, so we didn't have to pay tons of money whenever we wanted to change between USDC and USDT across different exchanges. So that's why I got into the ecosystem in the first place, why I stayed was because of the community. I think the Twitter community is just really good. In Solana, it's very motivating as a defi developer to just build when people are actually saying they like your product and they want you to keep building more products and keep just growing the ecosystem out. And that's not something you really get easily in other chains, trying to get people to rally behind you and have a specific type of culture where people get excited about what you're building.
00:13:30.704 - 00:13:57.930, Speaker E: So, yeah, that's what I like about Solana. On top of that, there's really good exchange support. So the support from FTX and just institutional stuff in general is really nice because then it's really easy for me to get my friend to just put a bunch of USDC into FTX us and just withdraw it. But that's not something you get on a lot of other chains. On other chains you might need to use a VPN. That's not allowed. You're not supposed to be doing stuff like that.
00:13:57.930 - 00:14:06.134, Speaker E: But FTX has actual official support in the US and also every other country. It's been really easy to integrate.
00:14:06.754 - 00:14:53.284, Speaker D: I'll add to that, too. Saver actually was started, I guess the first version of Saber was end of last year. That's part of the first Solana hackathon. So that's something that Ian and then our other co founder, Michael, participated in. And yeah, back then, though, the developer experience of Solana and even just the ecosystem in general was just a lot less than it is now. And even when we basically got back into working on Sabrit, which was in April of this year, and the way that I got involved with Solana, so, yeah, I was working full time at a fintech startup that wasn't in crypto, but still just really interested in crypto trading and also building on the side. And I was looking for a fun project to do, ended up just randomly seeing a tweet from Raj one day.
00:14:53.284 - 00:15:30.688, Speaker D: He was like, oh, we're looking to incubate a project that is going to do or basically start nfts on Solana, which is the project that end up being called Metaplex. That's a great shout to him. I was like, hey, I'm interested in working on this. Ended up just working on it part time. And yeah, I think one is just meeting the Solana team. So, yeah, Raj, Anatoly, people like Bartosz as well, I think they just had a very good vision of how they see the Solana ecosystem growing really fast and how they can basically create a niche amongst all these other l one s. Yeah.
00:15:30.688 - 00:16:05.374, Speaker D: As Eden was saying before, also institutional support. So, yeah, I was talking to some of the guys from Alameda from jumping, and, yeah, honestly, just, like, felt inevitable that Solana was going to become a big chain for finance. But what the problem was at that point was just there were not very many DeFi protocols. I think back at that time, it was mainly radium, serum, orca. Yeah, I'm probably forgetting some other ones, but those are the main projects there. And there was no stable swap. And because we already had this code that was written for the first Solana hackathon.
00:16:05.374 - 00:16:16.484, Speaker D: And also, just seeing Ian's, like, curve is just a very foundational piece of defi. You can really build everything on top of stable swaps. It's just more efficient than a normal stable coin to use.
00:16:17.064 - 00:16:17.520, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:17.592 - 00:16:31.084, Speaker D: Just made a lot of sense. And so me and Ian started working on that while we were still part time at our other job, ended up finally quitting and going full time on Solana in, I think, July of this year. And, yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
00:16:31.874 - 00:17:04.226, Speaker A: Yeah, man, it's crazy. You were talking about building and the developer experience, which is my job to fix, so just give me some time. But anyways, I look back at Mango and Daffy and some of these guys, and I actually asked Daffy one day on Twitter. I was like, how the hell did you build mango? With literally docs and Paul escrow tutorial. But people got it done. I don't think that it was easy. And then we also have a couple guys on discord that I promised I wouldn't name by name here, and developer support, that kind of just one off helped everybody get through a lot of this stuff.
00:17:04.226 - 00:17:08.338, Speaker A: So that was super cool. Did you have something to say, Ervin?
00:17:08.506 - 00:17:38.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. They talked really, about Defi, and one of the things that actually happens nowadays, that you want to have compostability, so you want to have Lego blocks coming together. And so l ones in general are pretty good for this. And so it was a matter of seeing, like they said, there were a lot of Defi protocols coming over. And because Solana is an l one, compostability is just much smoother. And so there's a multi chain world. People are talking about compostability also across these multi chain ecosystems.
00:17:38.254 - 00:17:41.730, Speaker B: Pocellar had that in his sleeve, right?
00:17:41.842 - 00:18:13.014, Speaker A: Yeah. So I had another question up here, which is, why did you stay? But now that I'm thinking about it, all this kind of just ties together, and it's probably the things. The reasons you came here are also the reasons you stayed, except for the community part, which I think, again, I just have to note that it was really shocking to see how quickly that community grew. And I think the NFTs actually allowed non developer participants to now join Daos. And there's a whole other level there. But we can talk about that another time.
00:18:14.234 - 00:18:48.124, Speaker D: I can talk specifically about staying. So I think when Ian I first started working on Saver, we weren't really thinking, this is going to be a huge project on Solana, at least in the beginning. Like, a lot of it was. So I think Ian kind of briefly mentioned on this, he was working on a lot of sello stuff. And so we were looking at how can we basically make the sello dollar bigger? And one of those ways was like, oh, we can build a stable swap on another l, one. That seems really promising. But I think as soon as we started, Ian posted a tweet on the saber Twitter.
00:18:48.124 - 00:19:06.726, Speaker D: It was called stableswap back then, and after I was seven, it was just something random and it just got tons of hype. Everyone was really excited about it. I think SPF tweeted it or retweeted it, and we were just like, oh, wow, Solana seems like a lot bigger than we thought it was. And, yeah, from there, basically just kind of went all in on Solana after that.
00:19:06.790 - 00:19:38.164, Speaker E: Yeah, it's not that it was. I guess Solana was big. It's that the community members were really active and involved in trying to get the egos to be bigger. And, I mean, even within Solana Labs, the employees of Solana Labs and even Anatolia and Raj themselves, they encourage us to build on top of Solana. Vitalik doesn't do that for you people in ethereum. So it just feels a lot more motivating that these people that are building this chain really want you guys to succeed and grow the ecosystem out. So that's just been really great.
00:19:38.584 - 00:20:14.284, Speaker A: I think. Another thing that was surprising, and I don't know if this happens on other chains, but you really have seen somewhat direct and indirect competitors that you would consider competitors in this space actually helping each other out with code and building in this kind of open, collaborative way. Obviously, that utopia doesn't last forever as things get kind of a little more competitive down the line, but when you're kind of, like, have a trajectory that's like a hockey stick in terms of developer community and projects, I feel like people are more willing to help each other, but maybe not again, like forever.
00:20:14.824 - 00:20:57.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so like they were saying, honestly, what's really exciting as a developer is that you really get to shape things bottom up. It's like the opportunity to do that. If you're thinking about coming to Solana, you're still pretty early. I became an advisor for Metaplex. I have a lot of nfts and did a lot of NFT work. And it's fascinating how the discussions about how do NFTs work on these other chains, let's say EVM compatible, you see that kind of like being applied, implemented right there. And I had conversations with Jordan and Bartosz and that and taking place, but getting a bit technical, for example, to discussing nfts on Solana or something.
00:20:57.070 - 00:21:50.624, Speaker B: When you look at EVM compatible chains, the standard for NFTs is at the business or social level. So an NFT is just a contract that you constantly deploy on Solana, the concept of NFT, and even a metaplex is a standard at the protocol level. It's on chain that people use. So what does this mean? Well, this means that rather than you having to say, okay, you have opensea, then you have known origin, and you have this other marketplace. If you're a creator and you want to have royalties on the NFTs on these EVM chains, all these quote unquote marketplaces have to come into a business agreement for these royalties to take place. With Matterplex on Solana, that standard or that concept of royalties is already baked or built in on chain. So the standard is already on the protocol.
00:21:50.624 - 00:22:13.464, Speaker B: So it means that artists, when they come in mint NfT using matterplex storefront, and then they go and connect to a marketplace, the royalties are there, which is very different. And it's also very motivating for artists and creators to kind of have this. And so that's also something to consider when you look at coming in and being able to shape the ecosystem and make it better.
00:22:14.124 - 00:23:02.684, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely agree with that. And we do all owe a lot of thanks to Mister Bartosz Lipinski here for not sleeping for two months straight and helping build the metaplex standard with redacted J. Jordan, who I believe is probably sitting at the hacker house like he has been for the last five days straight. So we have about 15 minutes left. And the more exciting question that I wanted to ask everybody might have a different kind of answer here. And we'll start with Bartosz is like, what's the thing that probably most excites you with Solana? I think the NFT world kind of blew up that excites some people. I'm personally, just to give a brief opinion, I've been excited about gaming for probably the last three years in crypto.
00:23:02.684 - 00:23:25.704, Speaker A: I know a lot of people from the finance world, they're excited about Defi. So super curious to hear what everybody else like as a developer is most excited of whether it's what's going to be built or how it's going to change the world or basically anything. So, Bartosz, what are you thinking here? What's the most exciting thing about the next six months to a year on Solana?
00:23:26.084 - 00:24:22.356, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So for me, it's maybe not the most exciting things, but free things. So the first one, like everyone is talking about games, and we have been talking with Arvind for weeks, months about games in general. Great team, tons of ideas. And we are basically thinking, how can we build it into a standard that's on chain, that games can become interoperable? And it's very tricky because you need to balance the composability of the games with the freedom for the game designers. So it's even harder than composing DeFi because the DeFi protocols somewhat agree on, for example, what money is, games sometimes don't. The other thing is, outside of games is seeing more collaboration from traditional finance.
00:24:22.356 - 00:25:15.916, Speaker C: I think seeing what PIV did, it's like, from the outside it looks very straightforward. But if you worked at any of those financial institutions, from the inside of those institutions, you would argue that something like that, it's almost impossible where you have multiple market makers and investment banks and exchanges actually sitting at the same table and exchanging technology for those. When I was working at Citadel, we were not even able to contribute open source software from our personal accounts during personal time. And then seeing contributing them and actually talking is very interesting. So, like being in Chicago and having multiple people come to the office from those firms and actually talk what they are going to build, it's like just crazy. We'd have like jumps Esqueana, CTC in the same room talking what they are building. It's just crazy.
00:25:16.060 - 00:25:46.270, Speaker A: And so, like, just real quick, like in traditional finance, in case some people don't know, is like the closed source is where the money comes from, right? Like there's no such thing as sharing and open source. It's like kind of the antithesis of what we're all doing right now. So it has to be crazy to come from traditional finance into crypto. So Ervin, what about you, man? What excites you the most about the next six months to a year here? On Solana, I think a lot of things.
00:25:46.382 - 00:26:30.486, Speaker B: Gaming is one. We're talking about gaming for a long, long time. On chain standards are a critical thing for interoperability, because people think about the metaverse, and right now you're pitched like a high level interoperability, where they say there's this game a and game b, and then you can share assets, but then you look deep down and how does sharing assets take place? Where there's a business agreement that game a will allow game b to integrate. And so is that really interoperability? I'd say no, it's interval at the business level, not at the protocol level. You can quote me on that. So that's the huge thing for us. And our background overall has been in immersive reality and even robotics.
00:26:30.486 - 00:26:59.092, Speaker B: I've been in the space since 2012. One particular use case that I haven't seen really take off is things related to data in IoT. The Internet of things. We're working on research papers, we publish academic papers. The comparison of IoT architectures with Solana and other chains, too. When you start thinking about what's going to happen in the next five to ten years, you look at 5g. Great.
00:26:59.092 - 00:27:31.708, Speaker B: I think the US is just figuring out 5g. Actually, we're already researching seven g in other places, and people are deploying six g. When you have these interconnected devices and you have cell towers nearby, you have all this collection of data. So what can we do? How can we provide provenance? And I think that's something exciting that needs to be explored more, and I'm looking forward to that in a near future. Besides that, I think anything goes like Defi and new models are yet to come, so you guys should keep an eye for that.
00:27:31.876 - 00:28:05.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the whole thing about you, how you talked about kind of being able to be so early and build this up and have so much influence, and I think that somebody brand new could come into Solana, a new project, and completely just shift everything in one direction. Just because it is still so small and we are so early, it won't take much to influence the way that things are moving. And I'm not so sure how I feel about Internet of things. I don't know if I want my refrigerator habits on the blockchain, but I'm just kind of joking. So, Dylan, how about you?
00:28:06.074 - 00:28:52.936, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm super excited about just seeing more composability. Like when we first started working in Solana, like I said, there weren't that many DeFi primitives. Now we're getting to the point where I think pretty much every basic primitive exists out there and it is of high quality. So, yeah, really cool to see. Just even speaking in terms of saber, in the past months or even past couple of weeks, I've seen a lot of new projects come out that are building on top of sabre, doing really cool things, and then now new protocols can come and build on top of those things. And so, yeah, I think for the next few months, just going to see a lot more really interworking projects. What's really cool about being here in Lisbon and working at that hagger house is just meeting other teams and they're like, oh, yeah, we were thinking of building this thing on top of saber and we can help them out and stuff.
00:28:52.936 - 00:29:00.464, Speaker D: And so, yeah, just super exciting to see more composability throughout DeFi and gaming, nfts, just everything cool.
00:29:00.584 - 00:29:15.164, Speaker A: Yeah, just you mentioned in the hacker house, again, reminded me is just so everybody knows, apparently the mango team has put up some bounties over there. So, like, if you want to go hack and build some stuff and then hit some of those bounty awards that, like, it's free, it's fair game.
00:29:15.324 - 00:29:18.504, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a few of them. There's, like, drift protocol.
00:29:21.444 - 00:29:22.116, Speaker B: Hero.
00:29:22.220 - 00:29:29.084, Speaker C: Hero. Yeah, I'm bad with names. There's more than 100 slippers.
00:29:29.164 - 00:29:29.828, Speaker B: The slipper over there.
00:29:29.836 - 00:29:30.700, Speaker C: Oh, the slippers.
00:29:30.772 - 00:29:31.424, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:33.964 - 00:29:40.884, Speaker A: So, Ian, you're the last one. So what's most exciting to you in the next six months to a year here on Solana?
00:29:41.044 - 00:30:21.148, Speaker E: Yeah. For me, I think the most important thing is trustlessness. So, like, on Ethereum, right, or any EVM chain, you can basically verify the contract source and know exactly what you're running. And on top of that, there's a community of people that know solidity and can basically say, like, if there's going to be a rug pull or not. But basically, since Solana doesn't really have a system for that, people really have to rely on, like, other people to say that something's good or not. But what this does is it restricts people from innovating. If you think about all the big developments that have happened in the Ethereum ecosystem, a lot of them come from these anon proton mail, email addresses that just post some random white paper that they create really cool things, but they don't want to say who they are.
00:30:21.148 - 00:30:49.510, Speaker E: But I want to see a culture like that develop in Solana. And for that, we need people to open source their code and verify the contracts have a centralized repository. Not centralized, but a repository where people can actually verify the contracts very easily and see what's going on. But yeah, with that, my favorite project in Ethereum was basis cash. It's like a basis protocol clone. They took the basis protocol whitepaper. It's a stable coin.
00:30:49.510 - 00:31:35.670, Speaker E: And they built it on Ethereum and just launched as an anon team. But that could never really exist in Solana today just because people would not trust something like that. So I just want to see an environment where people could just launch a project like that, build it and put it out there and people can just use it. And from that I would see, I think the TVL of Solana would skyrocket after that because then you just have all these forks of random projects to just all keep building and keep pushing out new things just like we see with Metaplex. NFTs only really got big in Solana because Metaplex made it really easy for someone to create a relatively trustworthy NFT where, you know, you're interacting with a candy machine, contract with Phantom, you can even see like if you're actually going to like get all your funds taken from you. And from that people are able to just like go into it and like not have to worry about like losing all their money. But I want to see something like that for just defi in general.
00:31:35.670 - 00:31:42.954, Speaker E: And I think contract verification is like the first step, but governance is also another thing. But yeah, just trustlessness in general I think is the most important thing.
00:31:43.574 - 00:32:11.458, Speaker A: Yeah, I have a, I have a somewhat just sense that I'm not like typically building on a regular basis. I have a little bit different perspective on what I'm excited about. And like, I think everybody kind of is probably also in agreement with us. I hope is that streamlining the developer onboarding and developer experience? Obviously it's been a huge challenge since day one. There was docs and there was Pow X. Now we're starting to see all these developers. I just saw somebody, I think his name is Brian Frail.
00:32:11.458 - 00:33:03.094, Speaker A: He just created a whole full medium or hacker hack to our dev two article on PDA's. Like people were going and finding all these gaps that have been confusing and they're now like writing content. And like, originally I was out there trying to find developers to help produce content. Now it's almost becoming a full time job to just capture that content and find it because people are just like coming onto Solana and making things and like, I know I wanted to kind of, since we have a few minutes left, one of the big ones here, I don't know if Armani's here, but, like, he is doing the Lord's work out there building anchor. And now it sounds like I see Ian tweeting about this all the time, that crates are coming out left and right. And, like, I mean, honestly, like, I think from. Most likely from the ETH community, like, that's going to be, like, the go to.
00:33:03.094 - 00:33:35.912, Speaker A: Like, there's, there's. I don't think we're at version one yet. On, on anchor, are we? Like, we don't have a fully. Do we know when that's coming? The fully audited, like, v one version? I think Armani gave me, like a month or two, like, kind of timeframe when then that would actually happen. Yeah. So. But I did think, like, just so we do have some time, like, what are your thoughts on that, Ian? Like, in terms of, like, anchor? Like, you guys started out Saber B, one straight Solana rust, and then part of that, still that.
00:33:35.912 - 00:33:39.226, Speaker A: But you've also built, like, some components. Yeah, yeah.
00:33:39.250 - 00:34:00.514, Speaker E: So the core saber contract, like, the actual swap, is not written in anchor, but every single other program we've ever used is built on anchor. But why anchor is really important. Is that. So? In Solana, you basically have to deal with these raw byte arrays to do everything. So you don't actually know what you're calling. You have to know what program you're calling in order to understand what's going on. But Ethereum is not that the case.
00:34:00.514 - 00:34:22.764, Speaker E: In Ethereum, you have these things called ABIS application binary interface, where you can actually see what's going on in a contract. So that's also important for this trustlessness, auditability stuff, where you actually can see what's going to happen whenever you do something with a contract. But, yeah, that's why I think anchor is really important in just onboarding a lot of people, not just for developer speed, but also for this auditability thing where people can actually integrate and see what's going on.
00:34:23.344 - 00:34:47.300, Speaker A: Yeah, super excited to see this happen. I know there's some anchor maxis out there now that don't even want to even look at, like, native Solana and Russian. So we got a couple minutes left. Did anybody have any final thoughts on, obviously we're talking about why Solana developers perspective? So, Ervin, did you have any final thoughts?
00:34:47.412 - 00:34:49.964, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. So I think I had that last third point.
00:34:50.044 - 00:34:50.984, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:34:52.244 - 00:35:48.424, Speaker B: So for us, it was very strategic, honestly, coming to Solana, and I mentioned the tech and the commander one thing. But, you know, personally as a founder and someone who's been since 2012, one of the most important thing are the people, right? And this matters because you're essentially as a founder or someone who's creating a product, you're going to dedicate your entire life for your entire weeks or weekends to really build on this ecosystem, right. So ideally, what you want is you want people that, one, have a strong conviction and vision for the product that they're building. You want, two, you want people that are eating their own dog food. So not just folks who are saying, we're building this. And you ask them, are you writing the code? Are you actually using the product? And you don't find that a lot. Right.
00:35:48.424 - 00:36:32.492, Speaker B: And three, you want people who are going to be there as you build a product and their ecosystem. And this is what we really found, like, when we talked to Anatoly, Raj, you know, Tristan, who's not here, was a key person, and Bartosz, when I talked to him, and now Jordan and Chase, you people are key. And this is what we see in these folks. Like, in all honesty, I think I told Chase earlier, I would say that Chase is one of the top developer advocates out there, because if you go on discord, you go on Twitter, he's out there. And so people do matter. And so if you're a founder or looking to create a product, you'll find those key things amongst the people that are building and those that are coming also in building Solana as a whole, as an ecosystem.
00:36:32.588 - 00:36:49.820, Speaker D: Yeah, I would definitely agree with that as well. I mean, I've talked to several ecosystem teams, I guess, on different l one s, and I think the level of support that Solana gives is just way beyond anyone else. And, yeah, really, really excited to be here for that reason.
00:36:50.012 - 00:36:51.024, Speaker B: 100%.
00:36:51.804 - 00:37:14.504, Speaker A: Yeah, well, we're kind of rounding it off here. Thank you guys for coming again. Bartosz, Lipinski, Irvin. Now, I'm forgetting all the names that I was kind of memorizing as I was coming here. Cardenas and Dylan and Ian Macleano. So thank you guys so much for coming. It was great to have all these different perspectives up here.
00:37:14.504 - 00:37:22.584, Speaker A: And that's it for our talk. So thank you, and we'll catch you around here.
