00:00:01.080 - 00:00:27.220, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Today we announced a brand new way to cement your memories as an NFT. And we open source the entire code base for minty fresh. Let me introduce the app and what it does. So here we have the app. Let me open that. It showcases all the photos that I have on my phone and then I can mint any single one in a very intuitive way as an NFT.
00:00:27.220 - 00:01:07.786, Speaker A: So let me pick this one, for example. So this is sunset at the Golden Gate bridge which is in San Francisco. So I put in some description, I just tap the mint button. This takes me to the wallet installed on the phone. So I signed the first message which basically is for me to upload the file on the blockchain. And we'll just wait some time for this to upload to ipfs which is the web3 way of like storing your images. And then the app asks me for a second signature that is actually to mint the transaction.
00:01:07.786 - 00:01:36.004, Speaker A: So I just swipe to confirm, put in my fingerprint again. And here we have minted the NFT. Let me reload this page which shows all my mint. And here we have our sunset image as an NFT. Let me also open the soulflare wallet that I have to showcase what nfts I have. And if the. And here we have the sunset image as an NFT on my soulflare wallet.
