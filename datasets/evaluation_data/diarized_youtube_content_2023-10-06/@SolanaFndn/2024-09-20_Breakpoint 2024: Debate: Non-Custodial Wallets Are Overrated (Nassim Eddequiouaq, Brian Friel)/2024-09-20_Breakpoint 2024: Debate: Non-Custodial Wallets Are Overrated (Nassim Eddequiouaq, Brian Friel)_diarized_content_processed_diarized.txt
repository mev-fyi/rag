00:00:03.600 - 00:00:56.285, Speaker A: Alright, welcome everyone. I am Sagar from A16Z and today I'm happy to welcome you to this debate on whether non custodial wallets are overrated. Our debaters today are Nas, who is a co founder of Bastion, and Brian from Fandom, everybody's favorite wallet, I'm guessing in Solana land. So yeah, please welcome Nas and Brian. Before we begin, I want to State that we, A16Z are investors in both Bastion and Fandom and so we're truly neutral for this debate. And let's begin with some opening remarks. I'll allow each of you three minutes to state your opening statements and state any key arguments you have for this.
00:00:56.285 - 00:01:13.185, Speaker A: So maybe I'll use a recent Solana block to decide who goes first. So I'm going to pull up Solana beach here and if it's a even number block, Nas, you'll go first. And if it's an odd number block, Brian, you'll go first.
00:01:13.265 - 00:01:15.449, Speaker B: Right? All right.
00:01:15.497 - 00:01:25.947, Speaker A: It looks like the last block produced but changed again, but the last one I saw was even. So Nas, you get to go first.
00:01:26.011 - 00:01:27.035, Speaker B: With your opening statement.
00:01:27.155 - 00:02:01.509, Speaker C: Cool. Well, first and foremost, thanks so much for being here. Thanks so much Brian for participating. I think that it's an incredibly powerful format for us to as an industry kind of like growing and really just thriving. We have to kind of like question and take care of the hard stances every so often, even though, you know, kind of like sometimes personally may have different opinions. So I wanted to start kind of like just a quick background on myself. I've been building in the kind of like wallet space and custodial space, kind.
00:02:01.517 - 00:02:03.213, Speaker B: Of like custody space for quite a bit of time.
00:02:03.309 - 00:02:21.383, Speaker C: Institutional side retail. Worked at Facebook on the wallet infrastructure and previously was at a 16z actually working with Cigar. And the way I'm thinking about it is that it's very important first as part of this conversation to establish the fact that custody and self custody is.
00:02:21.399 - 00:02:24.351, Speaker B: Not really a binary. Thank you.
00:02:24.383 - 00:03:07.159, Speaker C: Sorry, I was not talking close enough to the microphone. Custody and self custody are not really a binary choice. It's very much a spectrum that is actually pretty multidimensional based on different types of controls that can be pulled from a software perspective, a hardware perspective, operational security and so on. And so pretty important to keep that in mind as we talk. The second piece is actually there are two things to take into account. First is whether the wallet provider can actually move assets and perform actions on behalf of the user without the user's involvement. And can the user perform actions without the wallet involvement.
00:03:07.159 - 00:03:31.439, Speaker C: It's kind of like always important to think about the negative controls and the positive controls essentially as part of self custody. So having said that, I like to oftentimes just think about the history of wallet and adoption in the space. And the first question that I have is for people essentially to think about is who has onboarded the most users to the space? Who has onboarded the best measure to.
00:03:31.447 - 00:03:33.515, Speaker B: Give the 100 million people who have.
00:03:33.975 - 00:03:56.629, Speaker C: Wallets and some form of crypto assets in the wallet. And the reality is those tend to be crypto exchanges. The coinbase of the world, Binance, Kraken and many others. Even though wallets existed for a while before that, part of the crowd that had got like USB sticks and made mistakes by losing some of my assets and so on.
00:03:56.797 - 00:03:57.957, Speaker B: But I think that it really made.
00:03:57.981 - 00:04:02.477, Speaker C: It super easy for the vast majority of human beings to get into crypto.
00:04:02.581 - 00:04:04.581, Speaker B: The part that was pretty interesting is.
00:04:04.613 - 00:04:05.901, Speaker D: That right after this kind of like.
00:04:05.933 - 00:04:16.181, Speaker C: Initial onboarding, a lot of, you know, companies, you know, mine their wallet and obviously Phantom and many others have done it now, you know, Metamask and Phantom.
00:04:16.293 - 00:04:18.281, Speaker B: Have spent a tremendous amount of time.
00:04:18.353 - 00:04:24.673, Speaker C: You know, helping users graduate essentially from custody to self custody for users in.
00:04:24.689 - 00:04:27.873, Speaker B: A way that is, that is safe. It obviously is taking quite a bit.
00:04:27.889 - 00:05:06.783, Speaker C: Of time and you know, there are kind of like pitfalls and edge cases. But the part that is very interesting that we're seeing in the recent years is very much kind of like a recustodialization essentially of the the system, I feel like on the Web three side with embedded wallets, where we're actually trying to get back to social logins. We're trying essentially to abstract away as much as possible anything that is blockchain related. And as part of that we actually see wallet providers that have control over the authentication system, the authorization system and sometimes the key management system in a way that dictates who is allowed to.
00:05:06.799 - 00:05:10.137, Speaker B: Sign what in which, you know, condition.
00:05:10.201 - 00:05:32.601, Speaker C: So, you know, that's pretty much like whatever we're seeing from Poly Market, from Friend Tech and so on, you know, the ability to do very little with the wallet and very much kind of constrained to a single application in a way that is not that different essentially from a coinbase from in terms of user controls. So I wanted to kind of like start there and yeah, I'm very excited to.
00:05:32.713 - 00:05:35.343, Speaker B: I know that we only have three minutes to go over the head.
00:05:35.399 - 00:05:36.311, Speaker C: Initial thoughts.
00:05:36.343 - 00:05:37.551, Speaker D: But the one thing that I wanted.
00:05:37.583 - 00:06:15.289, Speaker C: To finish with is self custody should evolve in my opinion. Towards the same trend that privacy. So it's basically opt in and opt out, giving the choice to users rather than saying everyone should follow that and no one should have their data collected, for example. It's really a choice and giving the users the choice. And second thing is a lot of solutions out there are very much one line of code away from getting hacked. We saw that with the slope hack and many others even for self custodial wallets. So we very much like one login away and one software error or human.
00:06:15.337 - 00:06:17.745, Speaker D: Error away generally from getting your assets.
00:06:17.865 - 00:06:30.595, Speaker C: As an end user taken away without you being really involved in the process. Soft custody is giving you very similar properties to custody, often time in the way it's implemented today.
00:06:31.095 - 00:06:37.875, Speaker A: Awesome, thank you. So sounds like you're firmly on the non custodial wallets or overrated side of this.
00:06:38.215 - 00:06:39.767, Speaker B: Yeah, a little bit of nuance.
00:06:39.911 - 00:07:04.673, Speaker C: Yeah. And the one thing that I want to add is actually kind of like on session, we're seeing a lot of things with for example, like session, you know, kind of like session keys where we actually seeing kind of like pushing shared custody of things essentially going in this direction where South Korea wallets are trying to just give some form of kind of custody and control over the assets to kind of like central parties that are not the users. And yeah, I definitely think that in.
00:07:04.689 - 00:07:07.409, Speaker B: The way they're treated today, they're definitely.
00:07:07.497 - 00:07:09.329, Speaker C: Overrated and do not apply to the.
00:07:09.337 - 00:07:11.529, Speaker B: Vast majority of the human beings that.
00:07:11.577 - 00:07:13.977, Speaker C: I know outside of obviously these events.
00:07:14.161 - 00:07:14.809, Speaker B: Got it.
00:07:14.897 - 00:07:18.125, Speaker A: Awesome. Brian, do you want to state your position on this topic?
00:07:18.625 - 00:07:24.965, Speaker D: Yes. So I'm proud to say that I think non custodial wallets are completely underrated.
00:07:25.505 - 00:07:26.361, Speaker B: Nos.
00:07:26.513 - 00:07:31.705, Speaker D: That was great. That was surprisingly more nuanced and thoughtful than I thought you were going to come out here. I thought you were going to come.
00:07:31.705 - 00:07:34.925, Speaker C: Out guns a blazing.
00:07:36.145 - 00:07:40.345, Speaker D: Nas has done a lot, if you're not familiar with, he's done a lot of really extensive writing on this topic.
00:07:40.385 - 00:07:45.081, Speaker B: And his firm is really, I think, very forward linking in terms of regulations and everything there.
00:07:45.113 - 00:07:46.513, Speaker D: But I think, you know, you mentioned.
00:07:46.529 - 00:07:48.873, Speaker C: Something interesting there in terms of the.
00:07:48.889 - 00:07:50.265, Speaker D: Amount of people coming to crypto.
00:07:50.305 - 00:07:51.745, Speaker C: How are they being onboarded?
00:07:51.905 - 00:08:19.095, Speaker D: And we're proud at Fantom that over the last year we've onboarded over 7 million monthly active users to non custodial wallets on Solana. I think we're very proud of that because, you know, not just for us as a company that it was easier to build in Solana from a non custodial way, but we really believe that having access to self custody is incredibly important for the future of this industry and for the future of financial freedom. So.
00:08:21.435 - 00:08:22.515, Speaker B: At the end of the day.
00:08:22.635 - 00:08:27.283, Speaker D: Why does it matter? And what we think about it is self custody firmly aligns user incentives where.
00:08:27.299 - 00:08:28.531, Speaker B: We'Re putting users first.
00:08:28.643 - 00:08:33.707, Speaker D: If it's self custody and user has full access to a private key, they have the ability to fully exit a.
00:08:33.731 - 00:08:36.280, Speaker B: System that doesn't work for them, including phantom.
00:08:36.442 - 00:08:37.820, Speaker D: And we're at this really interesting point.
00:08:37.852 - 00:08:40.316, Speaker C: In time where not only on the.
00:08:40.340 - 00:08:57.604, Speaker D: Regulation side are things murky and it's unclear what maybe is considered self custody and non custodial, but we're also from a product side, really questioning what even is a wallet. We're seeing embedded wallets, come on. We're seeing telegram bots, come on. We're seeing social sign and recovery. And if you've read Naz's blog, he.
00:08:57.724 - 00:08:59.892, Speaker A: Has a lot of really great insights.
00:08:59.948 - 00:09:13.597, Speaker D: That take a lot of these providers down. And I actually agree with a lot of what he said where custody is a spectrum. But where I believe we stand is that not enough people are fighting for real self custody.
00:09:13.661 - 00:09:14.541, Speaker B: And at the end of the day.
00:09:14.573 - 00:09:19.957, Speaker D: It falls on us as industry leaders to push it forward. So when you look at something that.
00:09:20.101 - 00:09:21.669, Speaker B: You know is doing, claiming to be.
00:09:21.677 - 00:10:03.921, Speaker D: An embed wall, and at the end of the day their infrastructure has the ability to recover, you know, the majority of shards of keys in a shamir secret sharing, you know, scheme, let's say that you can see the writing on the wall and we all want to avoid another FTX situation. It's very tempting to say, well, we should just go full custodial, full regulation. But if you look at the history of technologies, you know, going back to like telegram radio, they tend to start very open with light like regulation. And as leaders form get market share, they tend to help influence regulation. That reinforces them. And I think it's on us as wallet providers to see the value in self custody and to push and fight for it. So I don't think we're pushing hard enough.
00:10:03.921 - 00:10:06.885, Speaker D: I think we need to keep pushing and it's our job and it's underrated.
00:10:10.545 - 00:10:15.913, Speaker A: All right, awesome. Thank you both for that. It sounds like you guys are like more friendly than I expected.
00:10:16.049 - 00:10:18.325, Speaker C: Oh yeah, it's getting started, don't worry.
00:10:19.465 - 00:10:38.255, Speaker A: All right, so obviously I've come prepared with some questions of my own and I thought we'd start with the easy stuff and then try to get into the weeds a little bit. Can I start by Asking each of you what wallets you use today. Maybe Brian, I'll start with you. What wallets do you use today and if you use more than one, why.
00:10:39.235 - 00:10:51.945, Speaker D: I'm a maxi, I use Fantom, but I also use Ledger, which I have to say I bring a ledger into Fantom as well. Also a proud Solana mobile owner, so I've used seapol within as well. So I don't know if you count those.
00:10:52.445 - 00:10:55.157, Speaker A: Okay, so are those like all the wallets used in Web3?
00:10:55.221 - 00:10:59.333, Speaker D: Well, we could get technical. We could say exchanges as well as.
00:10:59.349 - 00:11:00.837, Speaker C: Well, I think, you know, if we're.
00:11:00.861 - 00:11:04.765, Speaker D: Really opening it up to what we consider to be a wallet. Yeah, exchanges.
00:11:04.845 - 00:11:11.869, Speaker B: But for the purposes of what I consider to be an application standalone for managing keys, those are what they are. Awesome.
00:11:11.997 - 00:11:12.701, Speaker A: What about you?
00:11:12.773 - 00:11:35.145, Speaker C: Yeah, I have a, like different setups essentially with like hardware ledgers, different brands, you know, and kind of try to have redundancy there. Definitely use Phantom Metamask, a lot of central exchange stuff, I would say, and have some stuff other like highly custodial, like.
00:11:36.325 - 00:11:37.341, Speaker B: Yeah, entities.
00:11:37.493 - 00:11:41.685, Speaker A: Okay, so sounds like neither of you is really fully in one camp or the other.
00:11:41.725 - 00:11:41.901, Speaker D: Right.
00:11:41.933 - 00:11:46.517, Speaker A: Like it's not possible to be completely in the custodial wallet space.
00:11:46.581 - 00:11:48.909, Speaker C: But I don't think that we're really talking about us.
00:11:48.957 - 00:11:49.333, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:49.429 - 00:12:08.181, Speaker C: I think that the people that are on this stage, we've gone through a journey of multiple years of just understanding the pros, the cons, what makes it safe, just understanding the trade offs. We're not building necessarily for ourselves, we're building for a lot of people out there, just billions of people. And so I think that this is what we should be really focused on.
00:12:08.213 - 00:12:12.761, Speaker A: That's a great point. Is there something about your setup that you think like, my mom would never.
00:12:12.793 - 00:12:15.121, Speaker B: Be able to use everything about my.
00:12:15.153 - 00:12:21.497, Speaker C: Setup, like, I'm just happy if my mom spends like a day without asking me about like fixing the printer or.
00:12:21.521 - 00:12:23.889, Speaker B: The, you know, laptop remotely from, you.
00:12:23.897 - 00:12:42.081, Speaker C: Know, she's in France, I'm in the US and you know, she's like, she's like magic over the ocean. And I think that it's a lot of the same when it comes to crypto. I've been trying obviously to kind of like, you know, get my family on boarded and the reality that it really comes down to just central exchanges for a lot of the aspects.
00:12:42.233 - 00:12:43.721, Speaker B: Yeah, awesome.
00:12:43.793 - 00:13:00.885, Speaker A: Okay. One more thing I wanted to get clarified. Smart contract wallets, current abstraction, wallets, multisigs have recently become a bigger part of the wallet conversation where do these types of wallets fall in the custodial, non custodial spectrum, according to you?
00:13:01.425 - 00:14:19.545, Speaker C: It's a good question. I think that it really depends. They're kind of like the way I would try for everyone in the room to have a framework is essentially just authentication, authorization and then key management. Right. Like you essentially have these three kind of like layers and sometimes it kind of can be complex where you have like an embedded wallet that actually is kind of like the main kind of a key managing some on chain accounts. So it really comes down to like how are you thinking about each one of those things? Do they run together? Are they kind of like linked? If they're actually done sometimes separately by different parties, I would say that you end up with a fairly like highly like a lot of control essentially. I would say kind of a closer to custody than self custody in the sense that if the one thing that actually dictates who is allowed to sign what and when is actually the authentication system, then that can actually be spoofed, that can actually be manned in the middle, that can actually be intercepted and actually changing essentially the routes of the assets in a way that would make for example, the request from one person lead to the unlocking and usage of the assets of someone else.
00:14:19.545 - 00:14:36.521, Speaker C: I think that the big issue that people have like that misunderstanding that people have in the spaces, you know, self custody is like I'm the only one to see the keys, I'm the only one to have access to those keys. It's not what kind of custody is more about control.
00:14:36.633 - 00:14:37.025, Speaker D: Right.
00:14:37.105 - 00:14:57.315, Speaker C: And the ability essentially to get your keys to do something. And if you have the ability to get the keys to do something without the person's involvement, that's sufficient. And a lot of these systems actually tend to do that, which in some cases like works great. Like a lot of embedded wallets work great. Obviously love polymarket and others, but they can do a lot of things without my approval.
00:14:57.975 - 00:14:59.879, Speaker A: Brian, do you agree with that classification.
00:14:59.927 - 00:15:01.879, Speaker B: Of smart contract wallets?
00:15:02.047 - 00:15:06.647, Speaker D: Yeah, generally I think how we think things about Fantom evolving over time is.
00:15:06.671 - 00:15:08.799, Speaker B: We think of Fantom the application becoming.
00:15:08.847 - 00:15:10.647, Speaker D: An aggregator of many different types of.
00:15:10.671 - 00:15:11.799, Speaker B: Wallets you would use.
00:15:11.847 - 00:15:15.151, Speaker D: They all have them serve different purposes, have different trade offs to be like.
00:15:15.183 - 00:15:16.631, Speaker C: Tools in a tool belt.
00:15:16.823 - 00:15:18.351, Speaker D: I think there's a lot we could.
00:15:18.383 - 00:15:19.575, Speaker B: Do, you know, in terms of like.
00:15:19.615 - 00:15:33.463, Speaker D: Drilling down to like how do you generate the keys, how do you actually use the keys, how do you store them? I think what we're most concerned about as a wallet company, you know, we can put audits out every day, you know, if we wanted to.
00:15:33.479 - 00:15:34.047, Speaker B: But at the end of the day.
00:15:34.071 - 00:15:40.327, Speaker D: Like, are we actually able to recover and get a key unencrypted without a user's knowledge or concept?
00:15:40.461 - 00:15:42.667, Speaker B: And I think that's a place that.
00:15:42.731 - 00:16:01.595, Speaker D: We never want to go. We want to fully avoid that. We actually just announced like 30 minutes ago. So not to put on this file, put a new embedded wallet product, which we're really excited about. It's built on our own authentication scheme, but we were very intentional in designing it. It took us a lot longer than we could have done because we leveraged.
00:16:01.635 - 00:16:04.755, Speaker B: A new open source protocol called Juicebox.
00:16:04.875 - 00:16:09.919, Speaker D: To store the PIN shards that are used for encrypting, such that they're outside of Phantom's control.
00:16:10.067 - 00:16:12.159, Speaker B: So that even if Phantom went rogue.
00:16:12.207 - 00:16:33.431, Speaker D: And you had somehow you were able to get access to an encrypted secret somewhere, the encryption keys for that live completely outside of Phantom. And I think that's something that's not talked about enough with these embedded wallet solutions. It's like actually thinking through what are all the steps of what parties could go wrong and basically get recovered access, unencrypted access to my key.
00:16:33.543 - 00:16:34.799, Speaker B: Where would that happen?
00:16:34.967 - 00:16:36.103, Speaker D: And I think we as an industry.
00:16:36.159 - 00:16:37.239, Speaker C: Need to push that if we want.
00:16:37.247 - 00:16:39.745, Speaker D: To make self custody while it's accepted long term.
00:16:40.085 - 00:16:40.621, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:16:40.693 - 00:16:41.205, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:41.325 - 00:16:58.945, Speaker A: I think there's a burning question that most people attending this debate probably have. Not your keys, not your crypto is a core tenet of our industry at this point. Do you think custodial wallets might undermine that core belief?
00:17:00.645 - 00:17:03.277, Speaker D: Do I think custodial wallets undermine not.
00:17:03.301 - 00:17:04.925, Speaker B: Your keys, not your crypto?
00:17:06.865 - 00:17:10.753, Speaker D: I don't know if I fully understand the question, but I think the way I'd say, like, not your keys, not.
00:17:10.769 - 00:17:14.953, Speaker B: Your crypto is good in spirit, but even if it is your keys and.
00:17:14.969 - 00:17:18.001, Speaker D: It has your keys, you need to be thinking, who else can even get.
00:17:18.033 - 00:17:18.865, Speaker B: Access to my keys?
00:17:18.905 - 00:17:23.257, Speaker D: And thinking through that as well. Just because a wallet shows you your.
00:17:23.281 - 00:17:25.793, Speaker B: Key pair and your seed phrase doesn't mean it's safe.
00:17:25.929 - 00:17:28.201, Speaker C: I think trusting things to custodial wallets.
00:17:28.233 - 00:17:39.255, Speaker D: Work for a lot of solutions, but you also need to think, you know, what goes wrong there. I think Pasha's leading the way with, you know, regulation reporting all those strict.
00:17:39.295 - 00:17:40.183, Speaker C: Requirements, but at the end of the.
00:17:40.199 - 00:17:48.319, Speaker D: Day, custodial solutions will be subject to government intervention. And, you know, maybe you trust your government today. It's a different question of tomorrow.
00:17:48.407 - 00:17:50.943, Speaker B: So again, if you have tools in.
00:17:50.959 - 00:17:53.903, Speaker D: A tool Belt, you should have both got it.
00:17:53.919 - 00:17:59.697, Speaker C: And you don't think that it applies to self custodial wallets actually or event was that kind of like playing yourself in the city?
00:17:59.881 - 00:18:06.201, Speaker D: I think it's basically about different trust assumptions and I think that there definitely is basically a lot of this humans.
00:18:06.233 - 00:18:08.065, Speaker C: Are the issue and a lot of it.
00:18:08.225 - 00:18:19.377, Speaker D: And you should be able to distribute your assets I think between companies and software that you know, I don't expect most people to be fully building from source every line like a wallet that.
00:18:19.401 - 00:18:20.769, Speaker C: They read from scratch.
00:18:20.817 - 00:18:28.525, Speaker D: So I think we need to have all options on the spectrum available and yeah, we need to fight for self custody to be on that spectrum.
00:18:28.985 - 00:18:31.745, Speaker B: How? Can I just ask a question please?
00:18:31.825 - 00:19:00.641, Speaker C: Okay, so I have a question for you. How many like hops away from R essentially is phantom? Okay, I'm going to restart the question. How many hops away from being able to move my assets without my knowledge is phantom today? What would it take to move assets without your knowledge?
00:19:00.713 - 00:19:21.411, Speaker D: Well, you would have to fully like basically we don't store anything unencrypted on our side and it's all. I would recommend you read our most recent audit report which goes into detail on that. But its current state, there's no way for like a phantom employee or anyone else to get access to that. That's all happening on your client and your machine. So. Got it.
00:19:21.443 - 00:19:34.283, Speaker C: But someone is writing this code, right? Yeah, that's just pushing this code with like updates you guys launched. I saw like recently an update with you know, username which is actually pretty awesome. I think that like addressing is a.
00:19:34.299 - 00:19:36.451, Speaker B: Big thing to fix in the space.
00:19:36.603 - 00:19:41.463, Speaker C: But there are systems, there are people essentially involved in process.
00:19:41.519 - 00:19:41.831, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:41.903 - 00:20:09.951, Speaker C: And generally you tend to be one release away, one kind of like the wrong build. Maybe the thing like the test build ends up being the production build. You know, Apple doesn't verify those things or Google Chrome doesn't verify those things. So in a lot of ways Phantom is one hop away from being able to log my key. Just like a slope. Obviously there are a ton of controls in place. I'm just saying that it's something that is one hop away.
00:20:10.023 - 00:20:10.471, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:10.583 - 00:20:39.749, Speaker C: And everyone considered slow, you know, fairly self custodial to the point where like when things happen people said like oh Solana is hacked, but the reality is that they were one hop away from leaking those keys. So I guess my question here is not your keys, not your crypto is really just you're even with self custodial wallets with like the best efforts you're still hop away essentially I would say from turning into like full control over someone else.
00:20:39.837 - 00:20:43.813, Speaker A: Brian, I think I'll let you respond to that and then we're probably done with time.
00:20:43.909 - 00:20:45.357, Speaker D: No, and I'm going to continue the.
00:20:45.381 - 00:20:47.221, Speaker C: Debate like in front of the.
00:20:47.293 - 00:21:08.189, Speaker D: I think it's a great point. I think you need to be also bringing. That's why you're bringing in things like ledgers like Solana seed vaults where Fantom can't even get access to. That is important. Like I said, they're all tools in the tool belt. I'd say the same question also goes to the FTXs or the world which we all saw. And when that does happen, people reach for what they consider to be self custodial tools.
00:21:08.189 - 00:21:12.345, Speaker D: We need to make push on the other end of the spectrum of self custody to make that safe.
00:21:13.205 - 00:21:16.853, Speaker C: Ftx, by the way, the issue was actually with the fiat account.
00:21:16.909 - 00:21:17.173, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:17.229 - 00:21:22.545, Speaker C: That was actually like the lending was actually done on the ledgering on the fiat side. I don't think that it was on the crypto side. Correct.
00:21:23.925 - 00:21:29.083, Speaker D: I don't know those details but I wouldn't be surprised if they were loose with the fiat side. I wouldn't be surprised if they were.
00:21:29.099 - 00:21:30.091, Speaker C: Loose with the crypto side.
00:21:30.203 - 00:21:31.747, Speaker A: Yeah, it's possible but I'm probably not.
00:21:31.771 - 00:21:33.347, Speaker B: Going to speculate on what happened there.
00:21:33.371 - 00:21:33.739, Speaker D: Okay.
00:21:33.827 - 00:21:36.075, Speaker B: That was my understanding, but awesome.
00:21:36.115 - 00:21:37.427, Speaker A: It sounds like short.
00:21:37.531 - 00:21:38.027, Speaker C: So short.
00:21:38.091 - 00:21:38.723, Speaker A: It's so short.
00:21:38.779 - 00:21:39.451, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:21:39.523 - 00:21:42.215, Speaker A: I totally get it. Join us somewhere in the back for.
00:21:42.595 - 00:21:43.995, Speaker B: This debate continued guys.
00:21:44.075 - 00:21:49.523, Speaker A: But thank you for joining. I know there's so much more we.
00:21:49.539 - 00:21:50.883, Speaker B: Could have covered and probably should have.
00:21:50.899 - 00:21:55.235, Speaker A: Covered but it sounds like non custodial wads are overrated.
00:21:55.395 - 00:21:56.651, Speaker B: It depends.
00:21:56.843 - 00:21:58.655, Speaker A: Right? That's really the answer.
00:21:59.035 - 00:22:00.251, Speaker B: I think we both agree that there's.
00:22:00.283 - 00:22:01.815, Speaker D: A spectrum to this. Yeah.
00:22:02.195 - 00:22:04.419, Speaker B: Do we? I'm kidding.
00:22:04.467 - 00:22:27.515, Speaker C: I join us in the back to learn more. So the way I think about it is that I think that they're actually underrated for people who should be graduating essentially from custody at some point to have their own who have spent essentially enough time and the space like we should kind of like try to move as much as possible and again people just end up with both custodial wallets and south custodial wallets. That's kind of like I think the case for everyone here.
00:22:28.095 - 00:22:29.479, Speaker D: But I do think that they're highly.
00:22:29.527 - 00:23:00.635, Speaker C: Overrated for my mom, my sister, who ultimately just want to pay their bills, just want to pick up different things, just want to be able to gain access to the system and. Yeah, so that's really kind of like, how I'm thinking about it across the board. And I, regardless of this, really feel like it's a graduation process and that Fantom is actually doing a tremendous amount of work to make sure that people get to graduate faster than before.
00:23:01.615 - 00:23:02.719, Speaker D: So, yeah, I just want to kind.
00:23:02.727 - 00:23:04.575, Speaker B: Of, like, just give major props for.
00:23:04.695 - 00:23:21.005, Speaker C: I'm a user, so I'm a big fan, so I wanted to just state that, but I really. We'll see Custodial Wallets triumph for the vast majority of the humanity. Kind of, like, as an entry point for the ecosystem.
00:23:21.585 - 00:23:22.513, Speaker B: Yeah. Awesome.
00:23:22.569 - 00:23:24.113, Speaker A: I think, on that note, we're probably.
00:23:24.209 - 00:23:26.985, Speaker B: Going to have to get kicked off the stage. Thank you guys so much.
