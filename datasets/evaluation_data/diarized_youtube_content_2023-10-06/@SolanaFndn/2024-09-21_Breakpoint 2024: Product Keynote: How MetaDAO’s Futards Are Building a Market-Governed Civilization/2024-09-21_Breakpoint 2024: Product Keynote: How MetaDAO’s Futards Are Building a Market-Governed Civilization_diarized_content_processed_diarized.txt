00:00:06.880 - 00:01:05.577, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Profit and I am a contributor to metadao. Metadao builds markets for decision making. So I'm a big market nerd. I love markets. And recently many people have come to the conclusion that markets are a pretty good way to aggregate information. Polymarket being the notable example. Some people even go so far as to call polymarket the truth machine of who's going to win the election or whether monkeypox is likely to spread to the US and if we have a truth machine, it would make sense for us to try to use that truth machine to make decisions.
00:01:05.577 - 00:01:49.525, Speaker A: And so that's what we're doing. So how it works is you can imagine with an example of IBM deciding whether or not to fire the CEO. So the goal of IBM is number go up, right? They want to maximize shareholder value. And so you could create two markets. One on what would be the price of IBM stock if you were to fire the co, and what would be the price of IBM stock if you were to retain them. And say the market says that IBM would be worth $97 if you retain the CO and $106 if you fire the CEO. So the market is saying that IBM would be more valuable if you fire the CEO and you should fire him.
00:01:49.525 - 00:02:48.813, Speaker A: And so this is live only on Solana. So this is an example proposal that Dean's list out did where it was a proposal to revamp their tokenomics. And it turned out that the Dean, the people who bet in this market said that Dean would be worth more if the tokenomics proposal passed than if it failed. And so it passed. And what I'm excited to share is that soon we will have decision markets for any metric. So any possible decision. So a startup for example, could create a decision market on what's the probability that we're alive 12 months from now? If we pivot to this new business mode, a company could create a decision market on what would be our revenue if we add this new product or this new marketing campaign.
00:02:48.813 - 00:03:19.995, Speaker A: Or a government could measure what would be the expected lifespan of our constituents if we were to adopt this new healthcare policy. And so we believe that markets can re architect civilization. We think that the whole world will run on markets. This starts with metadow. Metadao is the world's first market governed organization. We don't have a board of directors. There's no Metadow Labs.
00:03:19.995 - 00:03:54.405, Speaker A: It's code running on Solana where people trade on whether or not individual proposals would be good or bad for the native token. And if they're good, they pass and if they're not, they fail. And we are early contributors to this dao and if you would also like to join, we are looking for engineering contributors so you can go to the site or to Docs metadow Phi if you just want to learn more or trade or to spin up your own market governed organization. Thank you.
