00:00:00.320 - 00:00:31.524, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Today I'm going to show you how you can make your Solana transactions up to 200 milliseconds faster. So here I'm in the Solana games preset, and you can see that just getting the block hash actually takes up to 300 milliseconds here. So. And you can actually very easily change this by adding a caching and saving the block hash for around 15 seconds. Because the block hash is valid for 30 seconds, there's actually no problem in just caching it and using it for a few more seconds. And, yeah, now, if I reload this.
00:00:31.524 - 00:00:44.256, Speaker A: So here, you can see now after I reloaded this, that actually all the requests getting the block cache from the RPC take now zero milliseconds. So try it out and make your apps more snappy today. Bye.
