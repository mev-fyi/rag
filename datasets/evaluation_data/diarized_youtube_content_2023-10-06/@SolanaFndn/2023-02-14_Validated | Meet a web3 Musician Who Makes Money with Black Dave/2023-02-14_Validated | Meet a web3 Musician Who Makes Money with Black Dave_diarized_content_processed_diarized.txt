00:00:09.240 - 00:00:32.292, Speaker A: I'm Austin, and this is validated today. I'm speaking with Dave Curry, aka Black. Dave Black. Dave is a musician and visual artist who uses web3 tools to build community around his work. But here's the thing about Dave. Unlike a lot of artists who migrated to web3 after building an audience in web two, Dave started his music career. Here he is, in every sense of the term, a web3 native musician.
00:00:32.292 - 00:01:13.360, Speaker A: We get into Dave's web3 origin story and explore the fundamental questions about experiencing music on web3. Dave argues that the friction of web3 onboarding, as compared to the ease of pressing play on Spotify, attracts a certain kind of user who is more proactive about their consumption of art. And that's a good thing. These are the kind of users who want to govern their favorite song like a Dao, collect album art variations as nfts, and buy social tokens whose utility is merely to fund an artist's idea. Black Dave has experimented with all of these and more in his web3 journey. So let's get right into it. Dave, welcome to validated.
00:01:13.512 - 00:01:16.360, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me. I'm so pumped to be here.
00:01:16.512 - 00:01:28.682, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really excited for this conversation. I'm looking forward to it. So one of the pieces I really want to start out with here is you started your career as a musician in web3. What does it really mean to be a web3 native musician?
00:01:28.778 - 00:02:06.094, Speaker B: The thing that has sort of set me apart from a lot of my peers who have had traditional music careers before getting into web3 is that my journey really started here. My earliest fans started in web3. I was someone who was onboarding people into nfts through clubhouse and started to get early fans through that before I even minted my first NFT, especially my first music NFT, because my first NFT wasn't actually a song. It's not like I don't have music on Spotify and on Apple Music, but it's that the priority is the music that I release on chain.
00:02:06.214 - 00:02:27.374, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super interesting. So, like, when you're thinking about that distinction, what does the space allow you to do in web3 that maybe you can't do in web two? Or why was I think. I think most people would look at being a web3 native musician and be like, oh, this seems harder than doing it the web two way. What about the web3 way? Like, felt right for the way you wanted to enter the space.
00:02:27.754 - 00:03:28.460, Speaker B: What I think is interesting about the traditional avenues of gaining fans and releasing music is that the more places you do it, the more silos you exist in. I think something that's really useful about web3 is that as long as I have the token address, I can direct everyone to one place, no matter where they participated in my journey. So as someone who's used a bunch of different platforms to release, I can say, okay, cool, everyone go to this website. And no matter which nft of mine you have, no matter where you got it, you can get in or you can do the thing. Because if you think about, like, if I have bandcamp or if I have a song in iTunes, if you download the song on Bandcamp, you can't go to iTunes and listen to the song. If you buy the song on the Amazon store, you can't go on Bandcamp and download it. And so with using smart contracts and addresses and things like that, I'm able to say, okay, everybody go to my website, and if you have the token, the song is there for you to download.
00:03:28.460 - 00:04:03.182, Speaker B: Not only that, but I can use it for other things, like merchandise and like tickets and whatever other experience I want to create. And then this is a bit of a contentious take. You know, the music NFT market hasn't found its value in the same way that the art NFT market has. But I'm able to give people things that theoretically will be of value later. I can airdrop things to these people. And as we continue to move more and more into a digital world, that's the reason that I think NFTs matter. They'll have things that were really exclusive to git because they had to be there.
00:04:03.182 - 00:04:30.456, Speaker B: And I think something about music is that a lot of it, you have to be there in order to really get what was so special about music at that time. It's kind of like if you listen to your parents talk about music and, like, the music they grew up on and the bands they may have seen, they'll talk about it in a way that you're like, this is just a CD, you know? And they're like, no, this is the greatest. And I think that that's really, really important in music is that you had to be there, whether it's physically or digitally.
00:04:30.640 - 00:05:02.840, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's such an underappreciated point of the streaming revolution, if we're gonna call it that. Is that removing an idea of ownership from your relationship to music and your relationship to art? I mean, you can make an argument that no one ever actually owned the CD. They were just licensing it. Like, you weren't allowed to actually go and, like, broadcast it on the radio or something like that. But there's something physical about having a record or a CD or making a choice, even in digital purchase, to say, I'm gonna buy this thing. I'm not just gonna browse through Tidal and click on something interesting to me.
00:05:02.952 - 00:05:50.244, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think so much of that, especially in music, is tied to the story of the artist, how you feel about the artist. Something that is very, very different from traditional music in web3 is that the artists are really, really present on the ground with the fans. And because of that, they're able to find out more who we are. It's almost like a hyper social media in a way. And because of that, I've been able to sort of meet people, gain fans, gain supporters that will support me no matter what, in the same way that I would support my favorite artists no matter what. And I think that that's really cool because one thing about me is I'll watch an artist's interview and that'll, like, have a big effect on whether or not I want to listen to their music.
00:05:50.244 - 00:06:32.314, Speaker B: And I think web3 is really similar in that way. And then when you talk about the ownership side, the people who have the NFTs, they truly have the power to sell it to someone else. And I think that that adds another layer. As somebody who comes from mmorpgs, someone who buys weapons and armor and things like that, and I can put it on the market in the game now, I'm able to actually realize, like, a real financial gain from it. And I think that that's so special for people who are getting in on what I'm doing, especially as someone who, as web3 was coming in, I was at the very beginning of my career. So as I grow, hopefully the assets associated with me grow in value as well.
00:06:32.714 - 00:07:12.168, Speaker A: I have some friends who are musicians. They all have a myriad of complaints about the web two music industry. I think if you look at folks who are on YouTube as youtubers, they all hate YouTube, they all have massive complaints about it. Almost anyone who makes their money as a creator doesn't really like how these platforms are structured. But there really hasn't been another option to go mass market. But hearing you kind of talk about your relationship both to web3 and musicians and artists that you personally enjoy the work of or believe in, I don't want to call it artisanal, but there's something that feels like it's much more grounded in a sense of community than a streaming platform can deliver. Would you agree with that?
00:07:12.256 - 00:08:02.904, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, totally agree. I think the thing that's really interesting here is that with streaming, a lot of that listening is really passive. A lot of that listening comes on the back of you doing something else. In web3, there are a lot of experiences, I think, where there are people who, and I've heard this before, who collect a lot of music, nfTs, but don't actually listen to a lot of the music, but they're very, very keen on supporting the person. And then I hear the other side, where there are people who only collect music that they would listen to. And then what they do is they create playlists of all of the NFTs that they own. But both of those people, I think, without regard to why they collect, have a connection with, with me, the artist, or any artist, and they wanna make use of that and show support in the most direct way they can.
00:08:02.904 - 00:08:41.074, Speaker B: And then I think, like, you know, I said this just a second ago, but, like, on the other side of that, they can realize something as I grow. And I think there are people who are really, really excited to get in early. It's like when you hear about someone who says, like, oh, I listened to them when they had so and so amount of listeners, and I think that web3 is a lot of that. And especially when you double that with how much space web3 has to grow in terms of adoption, not only were you early in the artist, you were early on the blockchain, and that's like a double cultural level up or double cultural flex. And so it's super exciting in that way.
00:08:41.454 - 00:09:40.564, Speaker A: I'm curious to go down this line of questioning. It's a little bit different than what we've been talking about, but I had a friend who used to work for a very independent record label. And one of the things that they did for the longest time is they wouldn't put their music on streaming because they felt like streaming was through that passive listening experience that you mentioned. They felt like it was almost a form of appropriation of music, that the actual culture of what they were trying to build, the convenience, actually was a barrier to what the artist's intent was with the work that they were trying to do. And that if you go back to the days of buying actual high quality files off the Internet, you have to load them on a flash drive and plug them into your stereo or something like that to actually access a flash of a song or something like that, it feels like web3 is kind of maybe the next generation of. By making something slightly less accessible, but still easy enough to figure out you can kind of keep the integrity of what an artist might be going for?
00:09:40.904 - 00:10:27.184, Speaker B: Absolutely. Oh, I feel like there's a phrase, anything worth having is worth fighting for is the phrase I'm looking for, and I believe that's true in music. The hard part about, I think, web3 and music is you have people who may be into what you're doing and maybe into the culture of what you're doing. And I'm a firm believer that culture is king or queen, depending on whoever. And with that, I think that there are people who are embedded in the culture that you're creating in web3, but haven't found web3. So you kind of have two cultural barriers in front of you. But if you're someone who is using the technology as part of your toolkit, then it's very important, I think, that the people who listen to your music or consume your content are in both cultures.
00:10:27.184 - 00:11:15.734, Speaker B: We're, I think, at a phase where we're trying to figure out how to make things easier for everyone who wants to listen to music in web3 or wants to consume an NFT or use any of the tech, but we're not there yet. And these barriers actually make the connection deeper. And so I totally agree. And on top of that, I think a lot about how, like, how important it is or how important it was. I still think it's important, but some people might feel a little differently how important it is to experience your favorite artist live. I think there are artists that I've loved that I saw live and felt a little less in love with, and there are artists that I didn't love, that I saw live and I was all about. And so I think that it's really important to have these experiences that require a little bit more work, but actually bring you closer to the artist.
00:11:16.194 - 00:11:35.538, Speaker A: One of the things that I really missed during the pandemic was that ability to go to a live show, because you're right, there's just, even if it's not the energy of the crowd, there's something different about that live performance component, and also that you kind of had to work for it a little bit. You had to get in a car or get on the subway and actually go somewhere and set aside time. It wasn't just like a passive experience.
00:11:35.706 - 00:12:04.334, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's the best, I think. And not only that, but thinking about not just you, but getting in the car with your friends and all being excited about it. Or, you know, I come from the era of forums and going online and talking to everybody about it, or even going on Soundcloud and looking at all the comments and then seeing like, there's just so much, I think, culturally that comes to be when you're having that real experience. But that real experience does come with barriers because digital has made things so easy.
00:12:04.974 - 00:12:11.494, Speaker A: What would you describe as the culture of what you're trying to build or curate? And how does Web three fit into that?
00:12:11.574 - 00:12:41.372, Speaker B: So for me, Web three is kind of the vehicle of a lot of my cultural ideas. I'm someone who grew up playing in rock bands. I'm someone who grew up watching anime. I'm someone who grew up really into street wear and sneakers and also making rap music, which is primarily what I do now. And so for me, those are the cultural points. I really just think about web3 as another means to proliferate that culture. I think that there are a lot of people, especially in web3, who are fans of anime.
00:12:41.372 - 00:13:18.182, Speaker B: I think there are a lot of people in web3 who are fans of sneakers, in streetwear and fashion. And so what I'm doing is I'm trying to create as many great experiences as I can around those cultural ideas. You know, in my discord server for a project I work on, we don't have an NFT chat. We only have cultural chats. It's an anime chat, a fashion chat, a sneakers chat, a gaming chat, and we don't have an NFT chat. If you wanna talk about nfts, feel free. But we're not particularly interested in nfts as much as we are in using the technology to push the culture.
00:13:18.182 - 00:13:24.218, Speaker B: And so culture, like I said earlier, is king or queen. And so that's how I try to move this culture first.
00:13:24.406 - 00:13:48.026, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's fascinating. So you mentioned that a lot of this kind of came to you through hanging out on clubhouse a bunch. I miss Clubhouse. I think it was like a very interesting discovery platform for communities in a way that Twitter, at its best, can be. What was that process like of going from hanging out in clubhouse to actually doing your first drop? And how'd that process go?
00:13:48.170 - 00:14:17.358, Speaker B: So I got on to clubhouse at the end of 2020 a bit before, like the NFT boom, quote, unquote. And I got on, actually, because of music. Atlanta rap music was running clubhouse for the longest time. And around that time, I'm from South Carolina, so close enough. And when you're in the south, it's all kind of one place. And so I managed to find an invite on the clubhouse. My friend had gotten one from his manager who had gotten one from a friend.
00:14:17.358 - 00:14:44.790, Speaker B: It was all these music people. And I get on and I'm going in all these music chats, and then I eventually start going into crypto chats, and there are very few of them. And then I started hearing about nfts. This was in December of 2020. And so I found a clubhouse room that was like, how to make an NFT in five days. That was the name of it. And it was like five 1 hour clubhouse rooms.
00:14:44.790 - 00:15:16.294, Speaker B: I went in, and on day two, I minted my first NFT. No clue. Just I had crypto that I had bought in 2017, so I already had crypto. I didn't have to go through the whole coinbase verification process that everyone else in the class had to. And I minted my first NFt, and it was just an unused cover for an EP that I was gonna put out. And when I did that, it was like, okay, this makes sense. But once that happened, I think January came around, beeple came around, and then everything went crazy.
00:15:16.294 - 00:15:43.386, Speaker B: And I actually spent a ton of time onboarding in web3. I like to brag that I've probably onboarded thousands of people into web3. I spent 810, 12 hours a day on clubhouse, just sitting on stage, just teaching people about nfts. If they had questions, I would answer them. If they had questions about how the blockchain work, I would answer it. If they had any questions, I would just answer them. And so that's actually how I built a lot of my community was through onboarding.
00:15:43.386 - 00:16:36.734, Speaker B: But on top of that, just like that energy was so insane. And I think, you know something that a lot of people love to talk about, bored ape yacht club wouldn't have done what it did without clubhouse. I think it was the perfect storm, you know, where an NFT dropped that people were interested in. And then people were able to go onto clubhouse and talk about it the same way that I was talking about how when you go to a show with your friends, you're all super excited and you all talk about it, and then you get more pumped for it, and then maybe you buy the shirt and maybe you buy the CD and maybe you buy the sweater or whatever. And I think that's kind of what was happening on Clubhouse, was there was this infectious energy around nfts. And then I think when we all moved to Twitter, it sort of shifted a lot, I think, towards people wanting to get more in a promotional mode and more into a professional and a businessy mode, as opposed to a really artistic space that I think was on Clubhouse.
00:16:37.154 - 00:17:32.458, Speaker A: Yeah, this is one of those things I've heard so many different opinions and views on, which is the intersection of clubhouse and nfts and then creating work on the blockchain. There's an interesting pipeline there for you because one of the criticisms of clubhouse in Twitter and wider culture was this was just a bunch of VC's hanging out with each other and talking to each other. And this sort of became a symbol for gatekeeping of the conversation and controlling access to who can participate in that kind of conversation. I think what I'm kind of trying to, like, get at here is like, your experience feels like something that was, is completely different from that narrative around what that sort of clubhouse into NFT creator transition was like, you know, as you're mentioning, like, yeah, I noticed this, too, on Clubhouse. Like, Atlanta was like, the place that a lot of the clubhouse stuff was happening before the NFT boom. Did you see a change in the platform as both NFTs and clubhouse started to take off?
00:17:32.586 - 00:18:04.342, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, I was still largely into trap music, largely into Atlanta rap music. I was working on music with, like, artists in Atlanta, producers in Atlanta, et cetera, et cetera. And on the NFT side, there were a lot of people who weren't into rap music, making nfts. And I think on the other side of that, something that a lot of us have probably forgotten about was how hard fine art pushed back against nfts in that time period. And so we were all, so much.
00:18:04.358 - 00:18:06.238, Speaker A: Of fine art is just gatekeeping.
00:18:06.286 - 00:18:41.270, Speaker B: Yes. Oh, exactly. And so we, the NFT community, had banded together around a version of a common cause. That was the things we are doing is fine art. And I think that that's so interesting. And even for me as a musician, I try to proposition this idea that music is also fine art, which is another conversation for another day. But then what happened was people wanted to become influencers, people wanted to become well known, people wanted to become big in the space, and they wanted to be the face of it.
00:18:41.270 - 00:19:33.364, Speaker B: And so what ended up happening was, I feel like a lot of sort of, like, factions arose, in a sense. You know, there were people who really loved certain communities and really hated other communities. When I was doing onboarding through clubhouse, I was like a core member, sort of of the first NFT club on Clubhouse, and it wasn't called NFT. So there was a club that was called NFT that showed up after. And so it's interesting how when everyone started to build their own communities, I didn't realize that everyone or I didn't realize how many people wanted to be the star of the show. And I think as. As Clubhouse gained more and more traction, as they opened up more, as more people were getting into nfts, everyone wanted to be the star because they're on top of, you know, being able to make money through selling nfts.
00:19:33.364 - 00:20:11.920, Speaker B: There was a lot of money in consultation, there was a lot of money in just doing all sorts of things that wasn't necessarily making art. But the only way, not the only way, but the main way that people's value is perceived was through things like how many followers they had, how many people showed up to the spaces they had, how many other people would say good things about them because the space was so early that we didn't have things that could really validate you, you know? And so your followers was that thing. It was very web, too. Social media, in a way. Super interesting to think about, but I didn't care. And I still don't really care. A lot of followers, not a ton, you know, but I have a lot of followers.
00:20:11.920 - 00:20:36.328, Speaker B: But all I'm interested in is getting the info out, getting my workout, and getting the culture out. But, yeah, I think as it grew, it got a little more catty. I have tons of funny catty stories. And then I think as it grew as well with the whole influencer thing, something that I think goes untalked about, and I'm confident still happens now, is a lot of hosts were getting paid tons of money for those spaces.
00:20:36.456 - 00:20:38.844, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like payola in the seventies and eighties.
00:20:39.184 - 00:21:09.104, Speaker B: Exactly. That was another reason to have a big following on Clubhouse, and everyone would be like, well, you can turn clubhouse into money if you're following Cyanough. And I don't disagree people were doing it. I just think that it wasn't. It wasn't a genuine move. And I think part of the reason that that first bull run in 2021 has the connotation that it does is because people were taking money everywhere for everything, and we should have moved a little bit more considered.
00:21:09.524 - 00:21:17.620, Speaker A: So walk us through, like, what collections do you have at this point? How do people actually engage with them, and what are they buying when they join the community?
00:21:17.812 - 00:21:51.898, Speaker B: Awesome. So I have a ton of collections, of course, since I started in 2020 and it's now 2023, my first real collection that I had put out was a nod to streetwear called flips. What I had done was I had taken logos of brands, flipped them to have crypto names instead. So, like, you know, like, I had the Chiquita banana logo, but instead ethereum instead of Chiquita and things like that. And that was my very, very first collection. So I didn't actually release music at first. And with that I wasn't even sure what utility was.
00:21:51.898 - 00:22:10.600, Speaker B: But I do have like, you know, the discord server and the normal things that you would have had. Actually, discord was barely a thing back then, but I had a discord server already for being a Twitch streamer. So I figured out how to do token gating and blah, blah blah. And I had a little discord community. I've got about 300 people in my discord. I've got about 200 collectors. So that tracks.
00:22:10.600 - 00:22:51.142, Speaker B: But I done that collection and then I did my first music collection in March of 2021. I think this may have been around the time that Blaux had done his large NFT sale. It might have been around the time that Latasha, the queen of music NFTs, had showed up and dropped her first music video and I had dropped a song and I dropped 20 pieces of visual art with the song. But every NFT collection came with a download link to the song from ipfs. So this is when I was really learning about unlockable content and utility and things like that. And of course I had the discord where I would drop things and have conversations with people and things like that. It wasn't quite a collector's discord, it was public, but there are private channels.
00:22:51.142 - 00:23:32.250, Speaker B: And I continued that journey by releasing more songs on Opensea and then moving into a couple of more curated platforms. I ended up getting on catalog, I ended up getting on sound. The main thing I think that a lot of people who join my communities get is just a more direct and anytime sort of access to me. And the last thing, the most recent thing I've made is something called Black Dave Token, which is essentially a creative funding mechanism that I created for myself. I minted a million tokens and they cost like $0.20 apiece. And the idea is that if you buy this token, you believe in the ideas that I have.
00:23:32.250 - 00:24:29.564, Speaker B: And the point is mostly that there are a lot of projects getting funding and not so much people getting funding, but when you think about when companies acquire other companies, sometimes they just want the people who work at that company. And I feel like there are a lot of people in web3 like that, that you're like, man, I really want to find a way to like get that person, even if not the project, because I believe in what they're doing. And so this is a skewed version of that where you don't actually get me, but you do sort of join the community of folks who support me. And then I talk to you guys about some of the ideas I have and some of the things I want to make in Web three, because something that I'm finding that's really tough in Web three, but I'm really dedicated to is showing that I'm more than a musician. And I think a lot of people in Web three are more than the thing that we know them for, and they want to be more than the thing that we know them for, but they haven't found the right vehicle. And so a lot of it's just community vibes. But, yeah.
00:24:35.704 - 00:24:41.220, Speaker A: So you have some songs that are also community governed. Right? Talk to me about that.
00:24:41.292 - 00:25:28.354, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I dropped a song called Sharp Back in 2021, at the end of 2021, and I dropped it as a fractionally owned NFT so a bunch of people could get in. And once it reached the three Ethereum price point, it was sold to the, to the community. There were 42 people who supported that. And what I did was I created a governance model around it and allowed the people who were the owners of the NFT factually to vote on the future of the song. So the first thing that I did that I allowed everyone to vote on was I said, okay, guys, should I release this song on streaming? And they voted yes, I think seven to one. And then the second thing I said was, how much should I pay myself? And there were only two options.
00:25:28.354 - 00:26:37.202, Speaker B: And I think this is kind of one of the things about creating a governance mechanism around your music is that you don't have to allow them to make every choice for you. You can decide what choices they get to make, but I think it has to be deep enough that they feel connected to the song when they make that choice. So I did those two things. Then the market crashed, and I am waiting. I'm actually about to restart soon, but the next sort of set of choices will be around things like marketing. We'll be like, what website should I submit this song to for playlisting? Do you guys know anyone I should email? What should the music video look like? How much of this, quote, unquote, treasury should I spend? Because out of my payment, the rest of the money was the treasury for the song. So it's like, how much of this treasury should I spend on my video? How much of this treasury should I spend on marketing and allowing the community to be involved in that? Something that I think is really special about this sort of model is that if the people who collect the songs have the ability to help the song go further, they may feel inspired to because they're invested in it.
00:26:37.202 - 00:26:48.330, Speaker B: And if, and if that helps the song, then when they sell it on the secondary market, they receive benefits from it. And so this is an early experiment in that. And so I'm just experimenting. I'm having a ton of fun with it.
00:26:48.522 - 00:27:22.878, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is fascinating because I think when most people hear a song owned by a dao, the obvious question there is like, but what I want is the artist's art. I don't want, like, you know, if you let every person in America determine what music sounds like, everything is going to sound like Taylor Swift and chance, and, you know, no shade at Taylor Swift or chance. But, like, you're not going to get immortal technique out of a Dao if everyone is contributing to what the actual content of the work is like. But what you're talking about is almost kind of like a giant, community owned record label at some point.
00:27:22.926 - 00:27:42.438, Speaker B: Yes. Oh, that's. That's. I think that's an amazing way to put it. You know, it's. It's that everyone, you know, when you talk about owning the art versus, like, participating in the art, I think that's kind of the thing is, this is sort of an extension of the art, as opposed to the final home for the art. You create it, and then you extend it to the community.
00:27:42.438 - 00:28:18.518, Speaker B: The community helps you build it better. And this doesn't even involve changing the song. Right. This is just, we have this product that we want to push, and I'm really excited about that. And I think that there will be a lot of music label models that come to be over time. But I think that this model and variations of this model are the ones that are most exciting to me. Because when you think about the complaints that people have about traditional record labels, we as artists, no longer own our music once we partner with a label, and now we have an opportunity to continue to own our music.
00:28:18.518 - 00:28:45.136, Speaker B: But the people who invest in what we're up to, and I hate using the word invest, but the people who support what we're up to, they also can see a reward if they work towards the proliferation of that piece of work. And so I like this idea where the artist continues to own, but the supporters also have a way to benefit. And I think that fractionally owned song that you then work on is a really interesting way to go about it.
00:28:45.280 - 00:28:52.720, Speaker A: One of the crazy stats that I had learned recently is that the average musician now tours something like four times more than they toured in the nineties.
00:28:52.792 - 00:28:53.584, Speaker B: Isn't that insane?
00:28:53.664 - 00:29:13.722, Speaker A: There's great parts about that. Yeah, there's great parts about that for, like, us as fans. But, like, that's a pretty brutal system if you're also trying to produce new work. And, yeah, I love this idea that there's ways that the monetization structures can be changed where artists don't necessarily have to go and be a part of that grind in order to make a living at the stuff.
00:29:13.848 - 00:30:15.194, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, I think something that I'm constantly at odds with, but also fully understanding of is, is the thousand true fans model where you, if you have a thousand people who spend $100, you have $100,000 in a year. I love that model. And I think that, you know, people entering web3, they started to sort of push that number down. They're like, it could be a hundred true fans now who want to spend a think. The reality for many, many people is going to be that it's going to be somewhere in the middle. It's going to be like a 5600 true fans where you have 600 fans who might spend 100, $5200, and then you'll still go on tour, you'll still have merchandise, you'll still take streaming revenue, you'll still do all of the traditional things. I think what's happening with the narrative around the thousand true fans versus the 100 true fans is they're both extremes, but I think that a lot of artists still want to perform on big stages and you can't perform on a big stage with 100 fans.
00:30:15.194 - 00:30:30.026, Speaker B: You can't perform Coachella with 100 fans. And you can live a life, you know, you can live, you can survive. And there are a lot of artists where that's their goal. I just want to own a house. I just want to get a wife. I just want to make music and not have to do anything else. And that's a great goal.
00:30:30.026 - 00:30:41.604, Speaker B: But I think there are also a ton of artists who want to be huge and they want to continue to, to try to be the biggest artist they can in the world. And I think of web3 as a vehicle for that. As opposed to web3 being the end all, be all for that.
00:30:42.344 - 00:31:24.188, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to tease that out more, but I think one of the things that, you know, if someone's a musician listening to this or they're an aspiring musician listening to this, there's a magic part of your story where you go from not having released music to releasing it directly to web3 and generating an audience that's, you know, substantial enough that you can do subsequent drops and subsequent releases. And, you know, this can be like the anchor of that community and that career that spirals out into other places. Where did those 100, 200, 300 loyal people for you come from? What was that process like of actually attracting them and saying, hey, I'm here in this space. This is what I'm producing. Are you interested in it?
00:31:24.316 - 00:32:11.020, Speaker B: I think that went through two sort of phases for me, and I think it might go through a couple of phases for a lot of artists who enter web3. So my specific story had a lot of onboarding involved. So I had a lot of people who were connecting to me as a person before connecting to me as an artist. A lot of people didn't even know that I had nfts out my first few months in the space, not until I released my first song. And so those people who were supporting me then may not have necessarily been fans of the music, but they were fans of black Dave the entity or dave the person. And I went through that for a bit for my first couple of drops where they were selling out, but they were selling out to people who may not necessarily be fans of the art itself, but were fans of the artist, which I'm fine with. Right.
00:32:11.020 - 00:33:00.660, Speaker B: Like, I think that as creatives, whatever reasons people want to attach themselves to us, we should accept and we should lean on. So I was accepting and leaning on it. And then after those first couple of drops and I started moving into the more broad music nft ecosystem, and my name started to get around a bit more, I started to get into a second space where I was finding people who were true music fans and they were looking for music that they liked. And so I was able to start to find people who were fans of the music as opposed to fans of the person. And so that was like a second sort of trip that I took. The way I think that that happened was just being present in those, like, clubhouse rooms, in those Twitter spaces. I wrote a lot about my experience.
00:33:00.660 - 00:33:46.654, Speaker B: I have a ton of things on my mirror about my journey in web3. I think every time I drop something, I would write a long mirror post about my mindset going into it. And I believe that through that and then through good work, people who were there for the music and were there for the culture were the ones that I started finding. So now I can go into a clubhouse room or a Twitter space, and people want to talk to me about anime or people want to talk to me about sneakers, or people want to talk to me about the new album that came out that aligns with the music that I make. But at first, there were just people saying, oh, yeah, Dave understands the blockchain. Dave understands nfts. And so I went through sort of two forms where it went from the Dave who was good at blockchain to the Dave who is good at music and good at culture.
00:33:47.234 - 00:33:57.618, Speaker A: So there's a whole business to be made on consulting on other artists drops, and you've done a little bit of that yourself. You were sort of an unofficial consultant on one of Snoop Dogg's NFT drops, is that right?
00:33:57.666 - 00:34:43.738, Speaker B: Snoop Dogg drop was an interesting story. The way that that went was Snoop Dogg had dropped a mix on Sound XYZ, one of the major NFT music NFT marketplaces right now. And it was like a 20 to 40 minutes mix. And I remember listening to it and being familiar with the artists who were on it. One of the artists that played on the very, very first song is this artist named Crayshawn. She got a record deal back in the early two thousand ten s, and her label ended up dropping her, but she had a really viral record at that time and she was on the first song. And I remember looking at it and saying, are there splits here? Do the artists get paid, you know, asking questions like that for all the artists who are on the mix? And I think we're still trying to figure out how djing looks in web3.
00:34:43.738 - 00:35:25.426, Speaker B: So I was a little bit early and a little bit aggressive in my stance, but it is what it is. And then I remember listening as well and saying, none of these artists on this mix, besides Snoop, are in web3. Why are you dropping in web3 but not working with artists in web3? I think that's the most obvious thing you can do as someone who exists in web3. And so what ended up happening was the founder of sound had hit me up and was like, Snoop's camp. Saw your tweets about this. It was a series of critical tweets, and they're interested in trying to figure out how to make it work. And so when they did their second drop, they actually picked up a few artists in web3 who had dropped on sound.
00:35:25.426 - 00:36:03.230, Speaker B: And I was one of them. So it was myself, Iman, Europe, Hinno and Meruf. The four of us had like a little sort of like web3 section of the mix. And then on top of that, we were written into the splits of the, of the mix. And so I thought that was a really huge move in the right direction. I think since then, too, you've seen snoop do a lot more collaborative work where he'll put out a mixtape and he'll call on artists who are web3 native and have them on the songs with him and then split the revenue with them. And so I think, like, you know, I don't want to take full credit, but I will say that I was definitely there, being vocal about the stance.
00:36:03.230 - 00:36:26.934, Speaker B: I think it's really hard in web3 to be critical of folks, because a lot of it still is a small form of a popularity contest. You don't want to be too hard, and you don't want people to be like, oh, all that guy does is talk down to people. But I do think that it's important to recognize opportunities, and that's how I try to think about when I'm being critical of things in the space.
00:36:27.754 - 00:36:49.874, Speaker A: When you're looking at the interplay between web two and web3, you talked a little bit about how that can be a component of a musician's success, and that doesn't mean they can't release their music on streaming services. What do you see as, from your view, the future of that model? How does this evolve into the future, and how does web3 fit into the music industry today?
00:36:50.034 - 00:37:41.308, Speaker B: Something I've been seeing a lot lately that I think is really exciting is artists will release the song in web3 first. That will be sort of the catalyst to create a campaign around the song in web two one, really, I think, interesting example is the artist Henno. So he has a song called neighbors that just hit a million streams, and it dropped as an NFT first. And using this model to get NFTs to our fans that exist in this space and have them sort of help us push the song forward. And push the song forward in a sense of, like, through the revenue that we generate through the music, we reinvest it back into the music. That's gonna be something that I think we're gonna see a lot of down the line, especially for independent artists. Another thing that I'm really excited about and that I'm personally trying this year, is using NFT sales to fund merchandise.
00:37:41.308 - 00:38:35.962, Speaker B: I think that's gonna be something that we're gonna see a lot more of. And then one of the, I think, oncoming big plays that we'll see is how NFTs and music factor into the metaverse. I think the metaverse is boring without music. The metaverse is boring with stock music. But the metaverse is fun with your favorite music in it. And so thinking about how, you know, as we move towards this more and more digital like lifestyle, how music ties into people enjoying digital spaces, whether that's through games on blockchain, whether that's through games in the traditional sense that NFT artists may be putting out, you know, there are platforms that exist that allow you to acquire licenses to use music through the blockchain. And thinking about, like, how that can really factor into music, I think if you're just selling music nfTs, you're selling yourself short.
00:38:35.962 - 00:38:49.814, Speaker B: There are so many other opportunities to make money the same as there are a ton of opportunities to make money in web two. Granted, a lot of them are hard to figure out. There are a ton of ways to make money in web3 that don't just involve selling a music NFT.
00:38:50.394 - 00:38:55.514, Speaker A: Who are some of your favorite artists producing music on web3?
00:38:55.594 - 00:39:18.900, Speaker B: Man, that's such a great question. I'm super glad you asked. I'm always like, man, I hope I have an opportunity to shout people out. Verite. She's a pop artist, but is one of the most web3 experimental people that I think exists in this space. Someone else that I am a huge, huge fan of, I think from a, from also a creative standpoint is Jamie Cornelia. Jamie can shoot video.
00:39:18.900 - 00:39:46.330, Speaker B: Jamie does graphic design. Jamie produces. Jamie is also a rapper and puts out amazing work and amazing media around every piece of content that they drop. Someone else that I love who's making latin music, reggaeton is excelencia. He's also another one who experiments a ton in the space. He's got a social token, he's got a strong community and a strong fan base. And he and I often will nerd out on the latest NFT thing in the DM's.
00:39:46.330 - 00:40:20.516, Speaker B: And then I think the last one I'll throw, and this is a really interesting one, I think Christina Spinae plays classical music. I found out about her on a polygon based music NFT platform. But she, I believe, plays violin and will make these sort of classical records that she puts on chain. When you think about like, especially like the art gallery space and those art gallery metaverse spaces, being able to have someone like Christina be the soundtrack to a Metaverse gallery is perfect. You know, I think it sets the vibe of fine art so amazingly well.
00:40:20.540 - 00:40:26.036, Speaker A: Definitely have to check them out. Dave, thank you so much for coming on the show today. This was a fascinating conversation.
00:40:26.180 - 00:40:50.852, Speaker B: You are amazing. You asked the best questions. I'm so pumped to be on this podcast. In specific. I know we didn't talk about it specifically, but something that I always say is that all the hypebeasts are on Solana. I believe that everyone who's into sneakers and rap music, all the stuff that I've been talking about this whole time, they're all on Solana. I just joined web3 so early that I haven't figured out my Solana strategy yet, so I'm coming for you guys.
00:40:50.852 - 00:41:01.252, Speaker B: I'm dropping music soon, but yeah, I'm super pumped to be here and I feel like this was such an amazing intro for me to all of you guys over there. So thanks for having me.
00:41:01.428 - 00:41:14.784, Speaker A: Of course. And if you ever want to chat, let me know. Validated is produced by Ray Belli with help from Ross Cohen, Brandon Ector, Emira Valiani, and Ainsley Medford. Engineering by Tyler Morissette.
