00:00:00.400 - 00:00:56.412, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's Changelog, where we go over the changes week by week on Solana. I am joined today by Jonas and let's get started. So this past week, Cardinal Labs released their news that they're going to actually shut down both their protocol and their services that they've been providing to the ecosystem. They've been really good developers and have provided a lot of great tools for people to use in the past, so it's very hard to see them go. What I'd recommend is if you are using Cardinal Labs as a developer, go look into any alternatives that there are to their rent scheme or anything else that they have built and make sure that you migrate over. There is. I believe it's a three week period before they're actually shutting down everything, so make sure you do your migration before then to avoid any issues.
00:00:56.412 - 00:00:59.824, Speaker A: Jonas, did you ever end up using cardinal ads in the past?
00:01:00.124 - 00:01:16.224, Speaker B: I haven't used cardinal ads, but I said that they're leaving because they were also very heartwarming comments under this, like a few hundred comments, everyone said, hey, sad to see you guys leave. And they did a great job. And everything is open source, so everyone still a great resource for the community?
00:01:16.604 - 00:02:02.586, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great that everything is open source so that people can still fork it and use it if they need to. Then another news. There is also Jupiter added their feature for Token 2022 adoption. So what you can do now is it will support routes with Flux Beam, which is the only Dex out there right now that has token 2022 support, and it will allow you to do basically use Jupiter and get token 2022 tokens. There's not many people using Token 2022 today, but it's cool to see this early adoption and we're really excited for when Token 22 gets full adoption at a later date.
00:02:02.770 - 00:02:21.584, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm also very excited about this one because there's also lots of discussions about what can be done with it now that wasn't possible before. There's also a new metadata standard which could be connected to it eventually and the confidential transfers and so on using some pools. So yeah, it's really nice to see the adoption of this program.
00:02:21.744 - 00:02:23.244, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really cool.
00:02:23.544 - 00:03:17.844, Speaker B: I think the next thing we have is there's currently a tooling round on cubic for the best tools on Solana currently built that you can now fund. So you can log in, approve yourself with some authentication methods, like for example, connect your Google account and your GitHub account and so on. And then you can provide some money to these projects, and then it will be quadratically increased. So if you spend a little amount of money to one of the tools that you really like, then it will be multiplied by some algorithm, and you basically give them more money with a little bit of grant you give them. So that's a really cool system. They're very cool tools there as well. Like, you can see the gum session keys, renaissance wormhole unity, SDK, cubic itself, tiny dancer caviar.
00:03:17.844 - 00:03:28.056, Speaker B: Check them out and pick your favorite ones and just put a little bit of money in it and see how it feels. This is a great test currently that's running.
00:03:28.200 - 00:04:16.122, Speaker A: Yeah. And also, if you do have a project, like a tool that you've been building in the Solana ecosystem, apply for the round and get your project in there so that it can be open for donations and be matched quadratically with the matching pool. It's great because we have a $20,000 match right now, and if people donate $1, I believe you get like $20 in match at $1 donation. So definitely get your projects in if you haven't already. And then in other news, there is also SRC 14 today. This is kind of like outlining all the different issues with SPL token and trying to rethink it for the future. So this outlines issues like barriers to innovation.
00:04:16.122 - 00:05:02.876, Speaker A: Because it's a single program, there's not clear governance, and then gives you some proposed solutions. Ultimately, this ties in very greatly with SRFC 15, which is interfaces, and SRFC ten, which is the traits. So those, all these different SRFCs are working together towards a common goal of making it easier to both create new tokens in the future, as well as new multiple programs that maybe follow one singular interface to do the same thing, both enabling innovation and less singular control over a program. So it's cool to see this coming out. Yeah.
00:05:02.900 - 00:05:13.950, Speaker B: If anything is bothering you about it, or if you have ideas how it could be better in the future, just come in here and write your comments. They are discussing it openly, so it's a great choice, great chance to help.
00:05:14.102 - 00:05:17.766, Speaker A: Yep. And then, Jonas, what kind of commits did you see this week?
00:05:17.950 - 00:05:39.078, Speaker B: I found one which is really nice. It lets you add the rust version to the Solana program, so there's not these accidental problems anymore, that you installed the wrong platform tools and suddenly you can't compile anymore. You run into some issues which are very hard to debug. So that's a very nice one to see. I hope this kind of make it in quickly.
00:05:39.246 - 00:05:48.358, Speaker A: Yeah, this would probably help out with some of the incompatibility issues that we've seen with anchor and native in the past, correct?
00:05:48.526 - 00:05:50.310, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
00:05:50.502 - 00:06:19.878, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Looking forward to being able to use this more often and having less incompatibility issues. And then in resource of the week, we have a few resources this week. One of them is Joe. Part of our Devrel team had released a new Solana tools repo under Solana developers.org. This is a place where you can go to look up all the tools that are out there that are within Solana.
00:06:19.878 - 00:06:36.080, Speaker A: So I'd recommend if you go there and you don't see your tool listed, make a pr, let's get it added so that we can have one singular location that has basically an awesome list of tools within Solana. And then what resource of the week did you see, Jonas?
00:06:36.192 - 00:07:25.376, Speaker B: Oh, there was a really nice pr from Bob Berger. I think he's called on Twitter, and here he is called a little bit differently, but he did a bunch of very cool compressed NFT utils in addition to the ones that are already there in the program examples. Now you can also, I think he has transferred mint and verify, which is also very nice because before it was kind of difficult to figure out if the NFT is actually valid in the program and he has an example for that. And maybe he also does more examples in the future. But this is really nice to see these examples being added. And if you have anything that you want to share with the community, some program examples, you can always open a pr and yeah, we're happy to look at it and merge it and they'll help everybody.
00:07:25.480 - 00:08:20.228, Speaker A: Yeah, Burger Ralph's been shout out to Burger Ralph. He's been helping out with a lot of different things in the community. Like one, this example is great because when I remember when compressed nfts came out, everybody was still chewing glass on how to do it on the program side. So this helps out a whole bunch. And then two, he's also been helping out a lot with on the Solana Stack Exchange and getting a decent amount of reputation there, which a general call to action if anybody wants to help out the future of Solana developers and you have a question, or maybe you asked a question in discord and you got an answer, push that question and answer to Solana Stack Exchange. The reason why we do this is that for all those questions and answers, they'll get indexed by the search engines. And then when people have issues in the future, they don't have to go to a discord server to, to get their answer.
00:08:20.228 - 00:08:47.338, Speaker A: They can just do a quick Google search, get their answer immediately from the stack exchange and move on. So both do the question and answers. And what helps us greatly is if you increase engagement by uploading good questions and answers on the Solana Stack exchange. All these things help make the Solana Stack Exchange a better resources for all Solana developers now and in the future. So please help us out with that.
00:08:47.476 - 00:09:04.710, Speaker B: Yes, and it's actually also a decent amount of fun because you get points when people upload your questions and approve your questions, your answers as correct. And you also get some badges and then you get some new abilities that you can review other questions and so on. So it's a fun thing. Let's all do it.
00:09:04.782 - 00:09:07.286, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Please.
00:09:07.470 - 00:09:16.154, Speaker B: All right. Thank you, everybody. Make sure to sign up for the game jam, which is coming up in July, and see you guys next week. Thank you for joining.
00:09:17.122 - 00:09:18.054, Speaker A: Right, bye. Me.
