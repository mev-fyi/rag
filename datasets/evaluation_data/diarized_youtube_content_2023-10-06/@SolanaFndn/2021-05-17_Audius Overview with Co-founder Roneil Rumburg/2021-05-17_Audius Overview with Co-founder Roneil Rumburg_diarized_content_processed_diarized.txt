00:07:34.714 - 00:07:51.616, Speaker A: Okay. And I think we're live. Frames are not dropping. Awesome. Hello, everyone. How's it going? Can you guys see us real quick? Actually, let me know if you can see us. I think we switched over.
00:07:51.616 - 00:07:53.232, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, they can see us.
00:07:53.288 - 00:07:55.768, Speaker B: Yeah, they're saying, what's up? We got this.
00:07:55.896 - 00:08:13.684, Speaker A: Cool, cool, cool. There's a little bit of an echo. That might be the room I'm in. If it's too bad, we'll fix it. But welcome, everyone. Today we have our really awesome guest. With us, we have Reneal Rumberg, who is co founder CEO of Audius.
00:08:13.684 - 00:08:26.364, Speaker A: Audius doesn't need much of an overview at this point, but if, Renee, you just wanted to take a couple minutes, let everyone know who you are, what you do, and just give us the overview of audience, then we'll kind of jump into everything.
00:08:28.264 - 00:08:40.120, Speaker B: Yeah, excited. Excited to be here and. Yeah, so you know what, actually, I think the echo is actually on my end. I have. I need to mute my twitch.
00:08:40.192 - 00:08:41.216, Speaker A: You do need to mute one.
00:08:41.280 - 00:08:50.608, Speaker B: Oh, there we go. All right. Yeah, I need to mute one. All right. Yeah, no, that was. That was my fault. So, yeah, excited to be here.
00:08:50.608 - 00:09:28.954, Speaker B: Audius is a digital streaming service that connects fans directly with artists and exclusive new music. That direct bit is really what we see the key differentiator here being between Audius and some of the more traditional digital content distribution tools that have preceded us. But, yeah, I saw someone said in the chat, just started using Audius. This thing is great. It's awesome to see. And I think more broadly, I hope all of you get a chance to check it out because it looks and feels like any normal web two product. But behind the scenes couldn't be more different.
00:09:28.954 - 00:10:01.828, Speaker B: Audius is fully decentralized. It runs on a network of node operators that are in the broader audience community, who host content, who host metadata, who have indexing services that index that. And yeah, all that put together ends up leading to a user experience that looks and feels like any other kind of music player, but is owned and operated by the very community that makes it valuable. So that's what we're super excited about.
00:10:01.956 - 00:10:30.754, Speaker A: I love it. One of the most interesting things to me about Audius is the fact that a lot of users don't know that there's web3 or blockchain technology on the back end of this. It's something you can log into, and unless you're actually looking for it, you can go through most of the experience without realizing there's decentralized technology behind it. Do you want to talk about why that's such a big deal for user adoption and how this is kind of revolutionary approach to what you're doing.
00:10:32.174 - 00:10:57.150, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't know if we would consider it revolutionary necessarily. We really just felt that. So my co founder Forest and myself both come from a more traditional product building background, and we are just like, we need to build something that anyone can use. That was just the goal here. And I think the benefit that that's provided. Right.
00:10:57.150 - 00:11:40.942, Speaker B: Is I think the majority of audience users don't know there's any crypto there. They don't need to know there's any crypto there. You can sign up for an account, you can engage with content, you can upload content without ever touching a wallet or anything else. The client will actually generate all that for you and the audience. Client is interacting with Solana and POA network in the process of that because we're still in the midst of wrapping up the migration from POA to Solana. The fact that someone can just go start engaging directly with this stuff without having any prior knowledge is so cool. I think that's led to today about 4.6
00:11:40.942 - 00:12:52.876, Speaker B: million people use audius every month. We have about 100,000 artists that have uploaded stuff to it so far. Yeah. I don't think we would have managed to grow to that size with requiring every user to install chrome extension and do all of kind of the things that all of us, and all of you all listening probably, too, are very crypto native people. But I think it's easy for us to forget that your average user doesn't have the same tolerance for hopping through all these hoops. So, yeah, I think rather than really revolutionary, we see ourselves as kind of iterating on and pushing forward the usability side of crypto product to the extent that we can, and trying to both steal the best patterns that we're seeing other people employ for user interaction with products, but also try to invent a couple of our own as well. We managed to kind of co opt and adapt tactics from.
00:12:52.876 - 00:13:00.492, Speaker B: From many others and then in a couple of key places, push things forward in a way that led to what you see today where you're at. Yeah.
00:13:00.508 - 00:13:17.384, Speaker A: And the 4.6 million is an incredibly impressive, impressive number. I know over the past three months you've seen incredibly quick compounding growth month after month from users. How many users did you have at the start of the year?
00:13:19.164 - 00:13:32.076, Speaker B: We. I think crossing over January, we had like, we had just crossed a million around that, or they were at like 1.21.3 million, something like that. Yeah.
00:13:32.220 - 00:13:39.744, Speaker A: That is so cool. Were there any specific factors that you can link back to being the catalyst for this extreme growth?
00:13:40.924 - 00:14:22.968, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a really good question. So, you know, a big part of what we try to do is understand our own product and understand our own growth, which is a funny thing that early on we could point to specific things and be like, okay, this change led to this increase in engagement. Today. It's quite difficult actually. We can do nothing for a week. There have been weeks where the dev team was very focused on not something that was user facing, like some engineering improvement, architecture improvement, whatever else. And growth will be just as consistent as when we're launching new things.
00:14:22.968 - 00:15:22.190, Speaker B: So what's interesting actually, I think with a social product there's sort of a network effect that kicks in at a certain size where new users are begetting more new users over and over and over again. And I think somewhere along the way, and it's hard to point to some precise moment where we cross over that threshold, but at some point audius network effect began to kick in and the product has kind of been growing itself since then, which is a cool thing. It's very cool. And don't get me wrong, we still spend a lot of time listening to the community and building cool new things, right. To try to help people engage and whatnot. But like it's, yeah, it's. Anyway, long story short, it's very hard to point to anything or any specific set of things as moving the needle there.
00:15:22.190 - 00:16:25.454, Speaker B: I do think that token launching was a catalyst for like a lot of the recent growth, but that's been since October or so. And that definitely did lead to kind of this inflection point in a lot of the key metrics. But yeah, I mean, outside of that specific one, we can see, of course, and anyone can go look at our public analytics in dashboard audius Co and see all of the things that I'm referencing here. There are new features launched, of course, that when people, people are engaging with them, that means there's net new engagement. That wasn't happening before. But yeah, I think it's just this slow, steady burn of stuff. You just gotta keep giving users what they want and what they're looking for and it's to some extent your job to try to guess it at that and try it and then see if they like it or not.
00:16:25.454 - 00:16:44.354, Speaker B: And if they don't, cut it out, if they do like keep doubling down. But yeah, it's a fun game. It's like it's so funny to think about though. Like we, you know, we, we kind of, you know, our team and the community more broadly built this thing that like no one really understands now. Right. Like I don't know what drives our growth. Exactly.
00:16:44.354 - 00:16:50.802, Speaker B: Right. And I think most people don't, you know, with, with the products that they build and that's, that's really funny.
00:16:50.978 - 00:17:18.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I mean, realized product market fit when you can continue to not do a whole lot and you're seeing this growth month after month or at least nothing noticeable in the front end. One thing that you guys have done recently, and I think it's been a big craze all around, is NFTs. And so I know audience recently did an integration with NFTs native on the platform. Could we kind of dive into that briefly?
00:17:18.434 - 00:17:19.074, Speaker B: Totally.
00:17:19.154 - 00:17:45.264, Speaker A: I'm going to try. I see a lot of, a lot of nonsense coming on the filter through this. See if there's anything helpful. And if you guys have any questions for reneal, drop them in here and we will try our best to answer them in real time. Cannot talk about price obviously, but anything about Audius. I did see some stuff actually about the App Store. Audius is available Google Play and the App Store, correct?
00:17:46.204 - 00:17:58.154, Speaker B: It is, yeah. I'd encourage you all to go sign up and check it out. Yeah. Super easy to download. Get started.
00:17:59.134 - 00:18:00.634, Speaker A: We'll drop the link in here.
00:18:02.694 - 00:18:49.590, Speaker B: Cool, cool. Yeah. So on NFT stuff. So where I think the audience community started to see sort of a interesting opportunity emerge was there are a lot of great tools for issuing nfts, for selling them to fans, running auctions, doing things like this. We really didn't see a great place to showcase nfts, to showcase folks collections and importantly for artists to showcase the things that they've minted and shared with their community. I think equivalent of your portfolio or your discography on Spotify. Right.
00:18:49.590 - 00:19:45.098, Speaker B: Like we felt that the NFT artwork that artists were producing should live alongside of their content and everything else. So yeah, Audius launched a kind of NFT gallery feature, or we call it collectibles in our parlance. I think we believe these will go beyond just, you know, the kind of current notion of what is an NFT today. But yeah, so there's kind of, there are tools basically to let you connect your various wallets in other metamask or phantom or whatever else it may be with your audience profile and like index all the nfts that are there and show them in a nice Ui. So. And yeah, I think that's kind of like, generally the things that we are most interested in doing. Like, there's.
00:19:45.098 - 00:20:30.054, Speaker B: There's some really cool things that with, like, the scale of audience that a product like Audius has that sort of, you know, give us a. I think, like an opportunity to take a unique angle or unique lens on existing markets, right. But find ways to adapt them to a more mass market audience. Right. Like, where, you know, only one person can buy your, like, super fine art, NFt, but, like, all of your fan base could still view and enjoy that. Right. And that was kind of the, you know, the way, I think, the way that we sort of found to bridge this activity into our product in a way that was like, sort of very, like, kind of meshed well with, like, a mass audience kind of.
00:20:30.054 - 00:20:46.444, Speaker B: Kind of a model, right. Which obviously is very different from. From the. Like, you're going to auction one NFT for, like, the highest price possible, kind of. Kind of a model, right. Just different. Like, different metrics drive all of these different approaches and whatnot.
00:20:46.484 - 00:21:20.674, Speaker A: So. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I think the gallery model is really interesting because it's like, you can go through and you can view the artist catalog that's uploaded to audius, but it's like, hey, what else is this artist currently involved in? Or what type of art are they interested in collecting? It gives you a more personal look into them as a person outside of just the music. I mean, being an artist is already an incredibly intimate profession, but then being able to experience that other side of them is a really cool idea, actually. Are there any particular artists that are really taking advantage of this feature yet, or an audience?
00:21:21.574 - 00:22:24.176, Speaker B: Yeah, there are quite a few. Rac and Blaux come to mind as to that, I mean, they're just so, like, crypto native as artists general, they were very quick to jump on it. But, yeah, there's actually a great set of launch partner artists like Tanner or so that helped us trial the feature pre launch and kind of helped us work out some bugs and stuff. There are always bugs. And then, yeah, I think in that first week live, we had like 500 or 600 artists actually kind of onboard their whole NFT collection to Audius, which was really cool and also important to note. So to get access to the collectibles feature as an artist, you actually have to stake some number of audius tokens. So there were 400 plus folks that went in and did all that and got it set up, which I think we still need to improve the usability around that whole flow.
00:22:24.176 - 00:22:47.044, Speaker B: But that was really cool to see and I think, yeah, last we checked, I think they're, you know. Yeah, it ran the gamut of like a few really, really big artists to all the way to, you know, there were a lot of like bedroom producers and stuff that were like, oh, like I've been collecting nfts. I want to show them somewhere. Like that's, that's cool. So yeah, yeah.
00:22:47.744 - 00:22:57.422, Speaker A: It's a gallery in your profile. How I didn't know that you had to still to get access to that. Is there minimal number of audience that you have to stake?
00:22:57.518 - 00:23:13.758, Speaker B: Yeah. So you need to achieve a silver badge, which is 100 audio basically. So you have to have 100 audio tokens in your balance to be able to access it.
00:23:13.886 - 00:23:28.534, Speaker A: Okay. So yeah, I think leading into that. This is another good question. I was actually talking to a friend of mine the other day about this, but the tier system in audius, can we kind of do a quick breakdown of how that works and the actual functionality of that within the platform?
00:23:29.714 - 00:24:14.394, Speaker B: Totally, yeah. So what Austin's referencing here is there are four tiers of audience feature accesses as we talk about them. So there's bronze, silver, gold and platinum. So these are achieved at different levels of token holding, of audience token holding. So bronze is ten, silver is 100, gold is 1000, platinum is 100,000. So like different kind of features are ascribed to each badge level. There's also like you on your audience profile, you get that little badge next to your name if you have one of those levels.
00:24:14.394 - 00:24:59.324, Speaker B: So yeah, it's kind of. What do you call this? It's a great way to sort of level. Sort of the access to various things that are consuming resources at the network level. Right. That's crypto economically why this exists, right. Is like there are some, you know, sort of features that require like broader network resources to be consumed to kind of access them. And for that reason, like limiting access to folks who are actively engaging with the token on the network, I think the community felt made sense.
00:24:59.324 - 00:25:24.044, Speaker B: But yeah, it's been quite surprising. Cool. I don't know what to describe it with. To see that someone went and got a platinum batch set up. That's 100,000 tokens. We put that there as we figured it would just be a flex. I don't know, maybe someone would set it up someday or something.
00:25:24.044 - 00:26:12.420, Speaker B: Also, you can achieve a badge through staked audience tokens, which is key to say it's not just holding tokens in your balance, actually like staking them. So there are some folks with very large token holdings that have staked hundreds of thousands or millions of tokens. And yeah, that was how the first platinum badge got unlocked. And I think there are a few more now, but yeah, it's just crazy to think someone has 100,000 of these tokens because they want to get that little thing next to their name. The only other there is a secret feature that platinum unlocks as well. So if any of you want to, you know, go achieve a platinum badge, you can find out for yourself. But it is still a still well kept secret.
00:26:12.612 - 00:26:36.688, Speaker A: I love it. We can't tell you what it is, but if you really want to know, depending on how curious you are, just go and stake 100,000. Audience. It's cool to see because I'd imagine that a lot of these token holders are artists themselves. And I think before we dive into this, there's been actually several really good questions, so we'll cover those in a moment. But it's cool to see. And I'd imagine like, I was just saying that a lot of these token holders are artists.
00:26:36.688 - 00:26:57.228, Speaker A: So it's awesome to see that they're able to invest in themselves through this token and it kind of empowers them. And that's the full circle experience here with Audius, is that it allows them to monetize in several different ways and invest in their platform or invest in their future through the platform with these tokens.
00:26:57.276 - 00:27:52.054, Speaker B: Oh, 100%, yeah. Like, and giving them the opportunity to earn those tokens too. Right. Was always the key of the project. Like, by contributing content, by making audience more valuable, the network actually turns around and like distributes ownership of itself to you, the creator, contributing that value. Right. And that's a really powerful kind of flip in incentives that I think, you know, more broadly social products in, in crypto we're going to see, and especially on Solana too, when you think about what very, very cheap to basically free transactions unlocks in terms of, it's possible to build all these awesome social features that actually settle on chain, whereas obviously you can't have someone pay $50 of gas every time you favorite a track or something like that.
00:27:52.054 - 00:29:18.768, Speaker B: I'm very excited for, I think, the promise of web3 more broadly and user owned and operated networks to be able to be realized by these tools. When a network can basically pay its users, its early adopters, to help make it successful and big. How does that compare to a traditional social product? Why would you use any product that's like not paying you to use it? Right. At a, at a certain point? So I think that like incentive structure, I mean, it's just such a powerful way to, like, you know, siphon or suck usage away from an existing product when you can go and say, hey, like, this product will, you know, help let you own part of it in exchange for. For you doing what you're already doing, you know, like. And in our case, that Soundcloud, right, is the thing we always point people to, right, and say, hey, you're giving away your content to SoundCloud, and SoundCloud's not paying you anything for it, and it's not letting you monetize it. Try a product that lets you build a relationship with your fans and engage with them, monetize them in any way you see fit, and it'll actually pay you for dealing with doing that as an early adopter.
00:29:18.768 - 00:29:38.008, Speaker B: Right. I think that's. That's a really powerful thing. It creates this kind of, like, you know, this almost FOMo or I don't know what the right way to describe it is, but people thinking like, hey, if I'm early in this new place, I can get to control more of it, own more of it. But then everyone feels that way and comes in and it almost, like, self fulfills itself as a result. Right. Which is.
00:29:38.008 - 00:29:39.264, Speaker B: Which is kind of neat.
00:29:39.424 - 00:30:02.688, Speaker A: Yeah. It's a community growth strategy, but it's the way to reward those early adopters that took a chance and a risk on something before others. Others did. I want to cover a few of the things here, and then I might put you on the spot after some of these questions. But when someone asks, when can they upload multiple tracks at the same time, too?
00:30:02.736 - 00:30:45.262, Speaker B: Audience well, great question. I love questions like this because you already can, actually. So if you go to the upload flow, you can basically click to either upload an album or a playlist at once. You can actually, in batch, put in and annotate all the tracks, and then they'll get uploaded. So, yeah, you can already, if you'd like to. I actually. I believe it also allows you to upload multiple tracks without tying them to a playlist or an album.
00:30:45.262 - 00:30:52.230, Speaker B: Although I can't recall specifically if that's the case. I haven't looked at this flow in a little while, but I.
00:30:52.302 - 00:30:55.154, Speaker A: Dropping a mixtape on Audius every week. Don't.
00:30:58.334 - 00:31:13.280, Speaker B: Oh, man, I wish. I wish. Yeah, no, I. Yeah, I do have a, like, you know, quiet account that's, you know, I haven't had the courage yet to see. That's what you get if you get.
00:31:13.352 - 00:31:22.448, Speaker A: Diamond, is you get access to renewed, unreleased mixtapes, specifically on audience oh, man, I don't know.
00:31:22.496 - 00:31:31.244, Speaker B: I feel like I need to pay you to want to listen to my unreleased, unreleased mixtapes. I don't. I don't think anyone, anyone should be paying to listen.
00:31:31.784 - 00:31:44.104, Speaker A: You know, it's the equivalent of. What was it? It was the Martin Scrasselli or whatever his name was with the Wu Tang album. The guy that made one copy, it was like a couple.
00:31:44.144 - 00:31:45.184, Speaker B: Martin Shkreli?
00:31:45.264 - 00:31:54.684, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's the equivalent to that. You stake a million dollars in audience and get access to some never before heard music.
00:31:55.664 - 00:31:56.444, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:57.144 - 00:32:26.938, Speaker A: So, yeah, I hope that answered your question. It was who PK RaSm about uploading multiple tracks. So there you go. There's another one that I'm assuming you get all the time that was around monetization compensation or monetization. Where was it? It was comparing Audius to Spotify. Oh. How are, how is the artist revenue compared to Spotify? I know it's very different.
00:32:26.938 - 00:32:30.754, Speaker A: Different models, but. And I'm assuming this is something that you all get asked all the time.
00:32:31.334 - 00:33:26.774, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, totally. So the models are quite different. So in Spotify, just for everyone's context, so you understand how that works, you give your content to a distributor who uploads it into Spotify for you. Spotify, on a quarterly basis, basically counts up all the plays that happen, and then they make a payment out to what's called a rights society. So there are these not for profit organizations in most countries, at least, speaking from the US and like, western Europe kind of perspective, which are the ones that I understand the most, there are these rights societies that collect revenue on behalf of artists. So they get the money, then they pay it to the distributor, who then pays it back to the artist. Now, if you have a label that you distribute with, put the label in between the distributors.
00:33:26.774 - 00:34:10.396, Speaker B: So artist gives content to label, who gives it to distributor? Who gives it to Spotify, who gives it to Rightsociety? Who gives it to distributor? Who gives it to label? Who gives it to the artist. What that ends up meaning is the way that Spotify works. Unfortunately, actually, depending on how you distribute the content, it gets paid a different rate. If you distribute via label, you'll actually get paid like a seven to ten times higher rate per stream than if you distribute independently. Now, a lot of folks ask, like, why is that? It's because the labels negotiated a better deal than, like, an independent person can. And that's part of the reason audience exists. Right? Like, it should not be a play.
00:34:10.396 - 00:35:34.370, Speaker B: Should be a play, right. But I think we kind of, you know, tried to think about monetization a little bit differently with the design of Audius and said, why is it that they're, you know, why is there one size that fits all for streaming monetization? Why not give artists flexibility and power to decide how they want to price, right? Like what Austin mentioned about, there's this Wu Tang Clan album where they produced only one copy of the album and auctioned it off to, you know, now it has this famous because this guy, Martin Shkreli bought it. He's now in jail. Federal Marshals seized all of his assets, including this Wu Tang album. I think at some point, or maybe they did already, they're going to auction this album like from a federal marshalls. And all of that lore kind of makes this collectible more valuable, which is kind of neat because it's like this crazy pharma, bro bought it and then went to jail, and then the government took it from him and then now they're going to sell it again anyway. Why can't a platform let an artist do something like that with their fans? All this leads into, how does audience think about monetization? We give artists a power to gate access to their content based on any input they want.
00:35:34.370 - 00:36:19.234, Speaker B: That input could be, you paid a dollar to listen to it or you paid a cent to listen to it. That input could also be like, do you own one of my NFts as an artist? It could be there's certain artists who, unfortunately, I can't share the name of here, who wanted to have a song playable only at a certain altitude so that you could only listen to the track if you were in a plane. Now, I don't know what. Yeah, right. It was a very cool idea. I don't know how you get some oracle to report the altitude that someone is at or do so in a trustless way. Actually, the way we kind of.
00:36:19.234 - 00:37:47.654, Speaker B: The best way we had come up with for it was to look at the ISP of the IP address, making the request to listen, and if you can get it, Panasonic and there are a few other ISP's that basically serve those satellite airplane Internet connections, maybe you could gate it that way. Why should that not be something the artist has the control over? Now, I can't say anyone is going to go get in a plane to listen to your music, but I'm also not going to sit here and say, you shouldn't be able to do that. I think that's the coolest thing about how this is approached, is when artists own the relationship with their fans and they can monetize it in any way they see fit. I mean, we know of artists kind of working on and wanting to engage on everything from, like, fan club sort of tooling so they can arrange fans around them in audience in some, like, paid manner to get access to exclusive content, to artists wanting to, like, charge $100 every time someone listens to their ultra set or something after they play the show. And, you know, knowingly limiting their audience with that price point, but knowing also that the people who are willing to pay that and. And listen, or really going to thoughtfully listen to that and engage with it in a way that they probably wouldn't engage with. Just the typical free track.
00:37:47.654 - 00:38:31.334, Speaker B: One of the things artists complain about so much is they feel like Spotify has cheapened their music, because Spotify is this jukebox of all the world's content that you can find forever. So artists are selecting not to release a lot of things there because I feel like it'll get commodified and cheapened in the process, which it is. Spotify intentionally commodifies music, which there's nothing inherently wrong with that other than that it's restrictive to say that that's the only way that we should be able to monetize music. And audius exists to create more flexibility and optionality in that.
00:38:32.214 - 00:38:40.318, Speaker A: What? There's been some really good questions, so we'll address that. It seems like there's a lot of people that are actually uploading music to the platform that are in here asking questions.
00:38:40.366 - 00:38:41.006, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:38:41.150 - 00:38:52.554, Speaker A: We'll be able to hit some of this in real time, but what music stream platform currently pays the most? Isn't it, wasn't it title for the longest time by like a pretty large margin?
00:38:52.894 - 00:38:53.670, Speaker B: Yes.
00:38:53.822 - 00:38:54.302, Speaker A: Okay.
00:38:54.358 - 00:39:37.296, Speaker B: Yeah. So on a per stream rate title paid the most by like, a good margin for a while, I think actually is still true. Still true today, although they don't quite have the same level of usage as they once did, especially because they had quite a lot of exclusive content at a certain time. And there were actually some really cool, innovative things. I think they did too. This idea of the evolving album song that gets better and better over time. You can come back and listen to the same album a month later and it'll like, maybe be a little bit different.
00:39:37.296 - 00:40:03.432, Speaker B: Right. I think that's a, that was like, a really cool idea, and I'm kind of bummed that, you know, that that hasn't been developed more. More broadly. But, but yeah. So per stream rates range from, you know, I think a little over a cent on title, if I recall correctly. Although I need to, you know, don't, don't quote me on that. I need to go check to a very small fraction of a cent.
00:40:03.432 - 00:40:57.564, Speaker B: In the case of Spotify, the per stream rate on Spotify is less than half the title rate. YouTube actually, surprisingly monetizes quite well for artists too. It's because video CPC's like the ad, sort of royalty revenue rates for video ads are much, much higher than they are for other forms of media. And like, a paid Spotify subscriber, actually, I think leads to less revenue for the artists they listen to than someone just watching a video ad on YouTube before they see the track, which is, like, pretty, pretty interesting. So, yeah, the rates are kind of all over the place. I think across the board, we feel that they're too low for obvious reason. Right.
00:40:57.564 - 00:41:50.964, Speaker B: And I think that's what happens when you try to make one size fits all streaming, right. I think for the majority of artists today, they see streaming as a loss leader and a source of marketing for the ways that they actually monetize, which are merch and touring. So, like, those are the two revenue streams that are kind of the majority of revenue for a given artist and doesn't have to be that way. Two thirds of revenue generated by the music industry more broadly is recorded music related. Just like so little of that is making it to the artist that at the end of all of that, artists are earning a single digit percentage of recorded music revenue. And from the broader music industry, artists only earned 12% percent of the total. So, like, when you add up.
00:41:50.964 - 00:42:06.584, Speaker B: Yeah, when you add up, like touring merch, you know, all the Spotify revenue, all the radio playing revenue, everything else, artists earn 12% of that, which is, like, insane. It's just completely insane to think about. Yeah. It's just.
00:42:06.624 - 00:42:19.430, Speaker A: There's just so many people in between that are taking a piece of the pie that just by the time it gets down to the person who actually made the music, they see twelve. Yeah, that's fucking nuts.
00:42:19.622 - 00:43:11.668, Speaker B: That's nuts. Yeah. When you think about when I described that sequence, like, there are like ten steps to an artist getting paid, right? And like, each of those steps, there's breakage, there's delay, there's, you know, things go missing. There was this music modernization act legislation passed in the US like, a year or two ago that actually allowed the performance rights societies to claim as revenue a very significant amount of money that they just couldn't figure out where to pay. There's like, you know, money that had been paid to them, it was like $1.8 billion by the time this act was passed. It was just literally like, and what incentive do they have to try hard to figure it out? The problem is the artists don't even know that there's money waiting for them, right.
00:43:11.668 - 00:43:35.572, Speaker B: So, like, you know, the right society just sits on this pile of money and earns interest off of it. And then they actually got the ability to claim it as revenue finally through that. Through that legislation that was heavily lobbied for by, you know, no surprise who. Right. The very folks that are able to claim it as revenue. No, no. Actually, the right societies themselves.
00:43:35.572 - 00:43:51.946, Speaker B: The labels didn't benefit from. From that one. The labels did benefit from the Music Modernization act more broadly, but they don't benefit from the rights society being able to claim it. It's just like. Yeah, it's just funny. There's no. I mean, where's the voice in the artist in all of that? Right? I think it's this.
00:43:51.946 - 00:44:35.206, Speaker B: You know, when you think about, like, unionization more broadly in, like, traditional workforces and, like, what. What that leads to. Artists have never been able to collectively organize in a way that they could actually, like, you know, get treated better. But the labels are collectively organized in a way that lets them negotiate these better rates. Right. So it's almost like when unionization is sort of works in the opposite way where it allows big institutions to get better deals than, like, the independent individuals. It's quite interesting, right? You think of unions benefiting the worker, but in this case, it's actually like, you know, yeah, I can talk about this first, but it's very interesting.
00:44:35.270 - 00:44:44.566, Speaker A: You're passionate about it, dude. And that's why people love this platform. It's just like the people at the top actually building out the product care. I'm sure you're seeing this.
00:44:44.590 - 00:44:44.830, Speaker B: There's.
00:44:44.862 - 00:44:48.342, Speaker A: There's a ton of really good questions that are popping in now. I think we. I think we filter.
00:44:48.438 - 00:44:50.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been kind of tracking them.
00:44:50.342 - 00:45:08.174, Speaker A: Along, but one of them was being able to, to. Being able to name your own genre. So a couple of people were saying they would love more functionality and options when uploading a song and picking a genre. I don't know if you have any opinions or thoughts on that.
00:45:09.114 - 00:45:18.626, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a really good question. We thought a lot about this. What was that? Sorry, who said?
00:45:18.650 - 00:45:21.018, Speaker A: I was just saying it was buffalo on the beat was the one that asked.
00:45:21.066 - 00:46:05.716, Speaker B: Oh, buff. Okay. Yeah, so we thought a lot about this sort of user experience, and it's a balance, right? So, like, when this question first began was, there's a community called Jersey Club that took a huge liking to Audius in its very earliest days. It's a super cool community. I'd encourage you to check out their music on Audius and elsewhere. But rel, one of the bigger artists from that rell, and there are a few others, that community got super excited. They pinged our Twitter, and we're like, oh, hey, can we have a Jersey club genre? And we didn't think anything of it.
00:46:05.716 - 00:47:17.666, Speaker B: We were like, yeah, sure. Why not? Adding that opened up this floodgate of folks basically requesting lots and lots and lots of different genres. And that prompted this broader thinking and some discussions within the community about how. How would it make sense to kind of, you know, like, not have this, like, run completely amok, but, like, give people freedom around. The problem is, the thing we could never figure out was, like, you know, there are genres that you can, like, search by and slice and dice within trending and elsewhere. And if there are, like, thousands and thousands and thousands of those, it just would become, like, the content would get so fragmented, you know, like, because is something electronic dance music, or is it dance music or is it electronic music? And those could be three different, like, string tokens, but they effectively. I mean, okay, I don't want to offend anyone by saying they're all the same thing, but, like, I think anyone can probably say that those three are, like, you know, probably kind of the same thing.
00:47:17.666 - 00:48:03.228, Speaker B: Right. And so anyway, where we ended up coming to, there's actually this tag finality in audience. So you can add as many tags as you want to attract. You can come up with whatever tag you want, and then you can search based on those tags and sort of, like, see. See what happens? Whereas a genre is something that's, like, there can only be one genre for a track, which is why the categories of genres need to be mutually exclusive. Right. But I think, you know, there's, of course, the understanding that, like, the ontology of genres is never going to encompass every kind of possible sub genre of music.
00:48:03.228 - 00:48:44.308, Speaker B: Right. It's an imperfect solution, but I think it's the one that, like, the community kind of, you know, ended up getting behind. I think when folks realized, like, this is, like, a more complex thing when you pick it apart. Right. But the tag feature did come out of that, and I think has ended up mitigating a lot of that concern. So, you know, in retrospect, I think a community like Jersey club probably should have been like a tag, not a, you know, not a genre, but it is, you know, they get that cred, right? They were like the first, you know, bigger, like, you know, music making community to really latch on to audience. So, you know, I'm glad they have that now.
00:48:44.308 - 00:49:12.856, Speaker B: Right. They love the fact that this platform recognizes their community in a very real way. And I think that is the thing that we've even debated just getting rid of the genre entirely because it is mutually exclusive and limiting. Maybe you could just reflect that in tags. So someone could tag their content with five different tags. Right.
00:49:13.040 - 00:49:29.144, Speaker A: It's not mutually general organization, though, for like, like, I don't know what the right word would be for like querying purposes, I guess. And then you can use tags to like customize everything a little bit more if your specific option is.
00:49:29.264 - 00:49:52.564, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's the best. That's exactly right. Like trending, for example. Right. If you tags would segment, like a free form, tags would segment the track base on, on audience. I mean, there are 400,000 tracks here, right? It's like not that trivial to go find. You can't search electronic the word and get electronic music.
00:49:52.564 - 00:50:45.772, Speaker B: You need more precise ways to query things, to your point. And I think that is to some extent what the genre provides, but it's really the programmatic, product derived querying that that helps playlist for, like, what are the top tracks in X, Y and Z genre that are just automatically generated by the system. For example, you couldn't really do that with something like tags. So anyway, yeah, it's a really interesting kind of issue and one that has a lot of contention within our community, and rightfully so, because people are very thoughtful about the buckets they want to put their art into. Right. And I think they should be right. Like, you are bucketing yourself by picking a genre.
00:50:45.772 - 00:50:52.464, Speaker B: So anyway, I mean, I get where it comes from, right? And I think something that still requires more work.
00:50:53.564 - 00:51:25.024, Speaker A: I just want to point out, like how cool this is. There's tons of artists in here, but like, what other platform can you jump on Twitch and like ask questions directly to the co founder? It's just like, things like this are really cool. And so I again, really appreciate you taking the time, reneal. And I'm assuming all the artists in here are really grateful for that as well. There's tons of good questions in here. Now, I think someone asked, when I upload a track, how can I associate it to my already created playlist? Currently I'm uploading the track separately and then go to the playlist and add the track to it individually.
00:51:27.524 - 00:52:17.824, Speaker B: This is a great question so you can upload tracks to a playlist if the playlist is brand new. Our upload flow right now does not support at upload time attaching something to a playlist. This has been a very frequently requested feature from a lot of folks in the community. So I think someone is going to work on it, hopefully soon. I think it's, yeah, it's just such a like obvious thing, right? They should be there, but like no one thought of it until now, you know, like people are wanting to use that. So yeah, I'll put it like coming, coming soon. Tm, right, as we say about everything, you know.
00:52:17.824 - 00:52:48.796, Speaker B: And if any of you out there want to, want to work on that, please feel free to. Everything in audience is open source if you feel strongly that should exist right now. Like go, go, go build it. And we would love to get that out to the world. It's just sort of a matter of prioritization and stuff from our specific team's work. But I do think we do plan to get to it eventually. But someone else can do it first.
00:52:48.796 - 00:52:54.464, Speaker B: We've seen that with a lot of other features like dark mode and a few others, dark mode is critical.
00:52:54.774 - 00:52:56.950, Speaker A: I do everything in dark mode.
00:52:56.982 - 00:53:25.534, Speaker B: Yeah, so we didn't make the first version of that. That was just someone. People for so long had been like, we want dark mode. We want dark mode. And yeah, you just had gotten around to it. So someone finally just made a custom cSS sheet and was like, okay, this is dark mode and there's a chrome extension that lets you inject custom CSS into websites. So like if you install that chrome extension, then install this guy style sheet, you could get dark mode.
00:53:25.534 - 00:53:58.690, Speaker B: And then that was finally you're like, okay, like, you know, it's time, it's like time to get this into the core release so people aren't having to jump through like five hoops to get dark mode. But it's funny, I guess it's amusing to some extent, like how much people care about small things like that. But I think it's important and even better, like giving people the power that care about dark mode to like go, go make dark mode if you want to, right? Like if you know, if you care about that, like you can, you can go do it. Like, yeah, yeah.
00:53:58.722 - 00:54:20.494, Speaker A: Someone actually just commented about that and said, I love the fact that you guys have a public API which makes the platform accessible to developers through current documentation. Though current documentation is limited to read only anywhere when documentation will be updated as showcase post request to an audience profile. I don't quite understand in what that's asking, but it seems like you.
00:54:20.614 - 00:55:15.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I get it. So the currently documented API is read only. So you can query tracks, you can play tracks, you can do that, but you can't upload tracks or do things like that. So there are three or four third party products that have integrated the right side of the audience API. It's another one of those cases of like, the project team like myself and our early folks that are working on Audius haven't had a chance to actually go through documenting and cleaning up the interaction patterns for the right side of things. So there's actually a case like, if you're interested in building something around that, feel free to reach out to our team. We can help you kind of get pointed in the right direction.
00:55:15.754 - 00:56:06.346, Speaker B: And more broadly, I think actually we want to look to the feedback of folks, folks like you and the early adopters of that API. There's a product called stereo load that lets you copy content from your Soundcloud over to Audius. And there are a few other things like that. That of course, to make that work, had to consume the right side of Audius, which obviously does exist because everything's open source. Anything that the Audius co client consumes, you can also consume, but it just might not be documented as well. So another soon TM, but feel free to ping us as well and we can help you get squared away if there's a specific thing you're working on there.
00:56:06.430 - 00:56:29.082, Speaker A: I love it, man. And I know we're coming close to the hour. I want to be super respectful of your time. So I was planning on asking you about advice for hackathon projects, but it seems like most of the people in here are artists. So, like, right now, who are your three favorite artists on audience, and are we allowed to endorse publicly and before we.
00:56:29.138 - 00:57:02.362, Speaker B: Oh, that's such a tough question. That is such a tough question. And so I always use this opportunity at least to try to highlight some really awesome up and coming folks in our community. So, you know, if I hopefully at least, you know, one of these three folks, no one, no one has, or, you know, for any of you listening, you haven't heard of at least one of these three. Austin, I know you know, camoufly, I love him. He's like my. Like, he's just such a.
00:57:02.362 - 00:57:24.974, Speaker B: He's been both an amazing community member. But like, you know, putting aside that, like, he is an individual is a fantastic person. Like, his content is amazing. And that is, you know, the more important thing I think you have. People's art should kind of stand on its own, and his. His certainly does. So I would encourage you all to go, to go check that out.
00:57:24.974 - 00:57:51.380, Speaker B: Another one that comes to mind is my world. His name is Mai World. Incredible producer and singer rapper. He kind of like, you know, his work is all, like, fully produced by himself. And it's fantastic. I mean, it sounds like professionally mastered work that you would hear from, like, a major, you know, music studio or record label. Right.
00:57:51.380 - 00:58:44.490, Speaker B: It's just super impressive, and it's great, great music, too. So would point you all to both of those and encourage you to check them out. I also want to highlight, rather than highlighting a third person, I'll highlight a feature that helps you surface really cool underground music. And Audius, there's this section of trending called underground trending. So basically from creators who aren't verified, who don't have, like, the check mark or whatever. And also there are some other qualifications. I think they're like, kind of being below following threshold and things like this, but it's kind of like a trending leaderboard chart for specifically folks in that.
00:58:44.490 - 00:59:46.346, Speaker B: In that kind of, you know, kind of in that more up and coming category. So would encourage you all to go spend some time there, too. There's a lot of cool stuff on, like, the core trending, but I think the power of audience is much more in its ability to give, like, new artists, new creators. Bedroom DJ's a place to actually get discovered because it's just not. There's no other platform today that actually does surfaces stuff from people that you may not have heard before. Spotify is great for if you want to go listen to Ariana Grande, sure, search her name and go listen to it, but you're not going to find things through their core features that you haven't really heard before. So I think that, you know, that's the thing that, like, I love, you know, it's always cool to see big artists get excited and get involved, too.
00:59:46.346 - 01:00:20.950, Speaker B: It's definitely surreal when, you know, Diplo and a few others signed up to Audius who, like, you know, I mean, there's so many, like, Rac and Blaux. Like, there are all these folks that, like, you know, I had followed forever and ever to see them use a thing that, you know, I had played a small part in. Building was really cool. But yeah, I think the underground trending is the place to be. That's where the next White Iverson or song like that is going to come from, because that doesn't happen on Soundcloud anymore.
01:00:21.022 - 01:01:03.954, Speaker A: I love it. I love it. I was going to drop the spelling, but I don't want to butcher it. Do you mind if you just take 10 seconds and drop all the links to those artists profiles that you mentioned? You mentioned camouflage in my world, I think for anyone who's not familiar, if you're an artist on Audius, what Renee was referring to is I actually worked directly with Camoufly. We found him on Audius, and we were looking for someone who to make a custom beat for the salon podcast, and we kind of reached out to him and we ended up working together and it was. It was really cool. And so it's kind of like, very serendipitous encounters can happen on platforms like this that don't really happen on other places anymore.
01:01:03.954 - 01:01:35.830, Speaker A: And so it was really cool to be able to work with him and he was awesome. So, yeah, shout out to camoufly. So that was awesome. That was a really good rundown of everything, I think, for everyone who has, because there's a ton of feature requests here that we weren't really able to get to. Reneal loves what when you tag him on Twitter with feature requests, so make sure you do that. If you search for Neil, he won't be hard to find. Or just look at the Solana Twitter account we've recently tagged him.
01:01:35.902 - 01:02:08.016, Speaker B: Yeah, please, please do. We're always all listening. Audius project is the audience Twitter. So also feel free to tag that if you ever have things you want to surface through our team and come hang out in discord, wherever we're all bouncing around. We're also, of course, been hanging out a lot in the Solana community, so feel free to find us at any Solana related things, too.
01:02:08.200 - 01:02:34.704, Speaker A: Amazing. Do you have any last words for everyone that's watching? This is also going to be recorded. So this will go up on the, on YouTube, and this will also be auto replay on the top of our Twitch. So anything that amazing, currently watching or that might be watching. Any suggestions? Obviously, sign up for an audience account and upload your music there, because everyone else sucks now. But aside from, what do you got?
01:02:35.924 - 01:03:08.338, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's. That's exactly what I was gonna plug. Go sign up for audius. Make an account. Crypto doesn't have to be scary, like the user experience thing. This is always what we and our team harp on so much because it's just, I think there's so much potential for really amazing things to get built with these decentralized tools and rails. And Solana is a big part of unlocking that.
01:03:08.338 - 01:03:48.984, Speaker B: You now have a free, you know, well, not free, but very cheap transactions and the ability to have instant confirmation. But, yeah, more broadly, you know, like, yeah, I'm just excited to see more kind of, like, things that are actually helping, like, mainstream normal people exist in crypto and. Yeah, see more of that. I also see a plug in the chat about merch. There actually is merch store potentially maybe coming out soon. You didn't hear it from me, but that's my alpha leak for the day. Keep an eye out.
01:03:49.924 - 01:03:58.356, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. There you go. I think that's it. Thanks, everyone, for hanging with us. And thank you, Reneal, for taking an hour to talk to myself.
01:03:58.420 - 01:04:09.956, Speaker B: Oh, anytime. I mean, thank you all so much for having me, and thank you all for attending. This was. This was fun. You got it. You got to go choose somewhere to raid now with. With everyone listening.
01:04:10.060 - 01:04:11.304, Speaker A: Yeah, for real.
01:04:12.804 - 01:04:17.724, Speaker B: Is there any other crypto twitch happening that we can. We can bring you all to?
01:04:17.804 - 01:04:18.460, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:04:18.492 - 01:04:20.500, Speaker B: I have software uses all of my.
01:04:20.532 - 01:04:23.864, Speaker A: Cpu or my mobile setup, and so I can barely do anything.
01:04:24.564 - 01:04:26.212, Speaker B: Oh, your obs setup?
01:04:26.268 - 01:04:28.552, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:04:28.748 - 01:04:32.720, Speaker B: All right. No raid party today. No raid party next time.
01:04:32.792 - 01:04:38.964, Speaker A: We'll bring you back on for sure. But, yeah, I appreciate you all. You're hanging out with us and have a good order now.
01:04:39.704 - 01:04:41.584, Speaker B: All right? Anytime. See you all.
