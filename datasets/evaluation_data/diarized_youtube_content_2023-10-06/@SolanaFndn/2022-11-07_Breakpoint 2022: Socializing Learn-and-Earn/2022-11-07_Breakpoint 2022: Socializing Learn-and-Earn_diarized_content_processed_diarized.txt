00:00:03.640 - 00:00:06.710, Speaker A: Hi, we are Sheila Lirio Marcello and.
00:00:06.822 - 00:00:10.014, Speaker B: Kevin Yang, co founders of Metacrafters, the.
00:00:10.054 - 00:00:56.044, Speaker A: Platform where builders learn from blockchain experts, earn rewards and stablecoin, and get hired. We've been heads down, focused on execution over the past ten months and weather our now chief twit, elon himself to Anatoly, our fearless visionary. For Solana, this rings true. Running a startup or coating rust is like chewing glass and staring into the abyss. After a while you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends. Kevin and I can relate. After each founding numerous startups, I founded Care.com,
00:00:56.044 - 00:01:16.144, Speaker A: as Amira mentioned, which we took global to 20 countries. And then we took public in 2014 and sold to IAC in 2020. And my buddy Kevin here most recently scaled the Philippines fastest growing online food delivery app to 100 million in revenue.
00:01:17.704 - 00:01:43.884, Speaker B: Thank you, Sheila. Now, why are we building again? Why do entrepreneurs and coders gravitate towards pain? Because we enjoy the art of building. Or at Metacrafters, we say crafting. We are creators. We are here to innovate. We are building in web3 and feel lucky to get paid to do what we love.
00:01:45.744 - 00:02:27.240, Speaker A: Wow. And now imagine if we started you off on your journey of eating glass even earlier. What if we paid you to go to school, to go to the metaverse, to learn to code, build, and chew glass? We're on a mission to advance 1 million web two devs to web3. If we want Solana to be truly successful, we need tools to scale how we build on it. And there is power in numbers. Metacrafters is a platform where devs learn and earn and land web3 jobs.
00:02:27.392 - 00:02:28.124, Speaker B: Wow.
00:02:29.704 - 00:03:14.308, Speaker A: Let's start with learn. At Metacrafters, we are unlocking accessible, high quality education across across the world through blockchain and a learn and earn protocol. We aim to be the leading educational platform in web3. Our high quality courses are taught by professional Solana developers working closely with the Solana foundation. We enlisted in exceptional experts and builders to create a Solana competency framework, almost like a Solana Major, that covers employable and valuable skills. And then there is the power of earn. The cost of entry for developers is super low.
00:03:14.308 - 00:04:15.234, Speaker A: Free to start. Upon completion of intro courses, developers can earn rewards for more advanced courses. A developer pays $100 but gets $200 back upon completing the course, they double their money. Where do you get that to go to school? They get this in the form of crypto utility tokens we call cred, its wrapped USD, stablecoin and governance tokens we call kraft that can eventually be traded and converted as well as developers complete courses, a proof of learn NFT gets inscribed on the blockchain. This mark serves as a developer's resume and is accessible to future employers. As a proof of skill, then we focus on ensuring they land a job. Kev that is our marketplace unlocks competitive opportunities with top employers and projects.
00:04:15.234 - 00:04:53.210, Speaker A: You can be the developer who builds the next killer app. But wait, there's more. For all of you out there who are already building on Solana, you can join us on this journey to train the next glass chores to join our community and be what we call a master crafter. You help us create courses and make money. While you're doing it. We split the earnings with you. A majority of the powerful earn model goes back to the crafters, and we also share it with our Solana course creators, an ongoing revenue stream for our mentors.
00:04:53.210 - 00:05:04.454, Speaker A: There are so many opportunities for the Solana community to build this with us, but let me turn it over to Kevin to unveil what we're building and announcing today.
00:05:04.794 - 00:06:09.904, Speaker B: Thank you, Sheila. Metacrafters is the best place for any programmer in the world to learn, earn and land your next Solana job. Metacrafters just released soul proof courses where builders can learn JavaScript and rust and earn rewards as they advance through the Solana track. From beginner courses where crafters can get started building on Solana using JavaScript, for example, airdropping Sol or minting NFTs with Metaflex, all the way to intermediate or advanced level courses where you can build a portfolio and ship real world projects including NFT collections, Twitter clones, and even liquidity pools. Wow. So let me show you a sneak peek to the Metacrafters soul proof experience. Let's say a crafter is looking to level up their skill and wants to get started with our brand new soulproof intermediate course.
00:06:09.904 - 00:06:56.294, Speaker B: Crafters will be guided by one of our Solana expert educators like Kesh Boshik, Isabel Sieh and Ivan Morrow. But let's start with Isabel. Isabel, by the way, is only 19, but already the Philippines top developer educator. She started a school called Girls will Code. She's also a TA at the Stanford CS department, and she'll be teaching us today how to deploy our very first hello world program in plain Solana. Now, who remembers doing that? Raise your hand if you remember your first Solana program. All right, so if you know, you know, and if you haven't, check this out.
00:06:57.034 - 00:07:22.884, Speaker C: Hi everyone. Welcome to the long awaited finale of this lesson with running the program. The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to just build everything. So we do that with NPM run build. The next thing that we do is we actually deploy. And then finally the last thing that we do is we actually run the program. And this is with NPM run starts.
00:07:22.884 - 00:07:34.054, Speaker C: So this is everything that happened. Firstly, we make a connection to the Devnet cluster and then we have the public key of the payer.
00:07:35.954 - 00:08:27.094, Speaker B: Here, Isabel walked us step by step to deploying our very first Solana program. But aside from coding videos, crafters will continuously practice with quizzes and coding projects. The randomized multiple choice quiz will reinforce new Solana concepts crafters have learned at the top right of this screen. It's also equipped with an anti cheating camera to make sure no bots are earning this proof of learn. Four out of five, not bad. But even better, crafters get to showcase the full range of their skill in the Metacrafters coding project, where crafters demo their project and teach us line by line how they've designed the program. Here's an example of Peng, who just completed the sole proof beginner course.
00:08:29.634 - 00:09:04.834, Speaker D: Hello guys. So this is my final project for the Metacrafters module two. And here I will showcase how I did the three requirements. So number one is create a front end with the small button titled create a new salon account that generates a new key pair and airdrops to solve to the newly created key pair. So this is where we generate the key pair upon clicking the button so we can see it here. So I established a connection here. If you take a look at it, it just connects to the devnet as a default, but you can also connect to different clusters as well.
00:09:06.374 - 00:09:48.800, Speaker B: Teaching, we believe, is always the best form of learning, and crafters will also get to show potential employers their skills. Once successfully graded, crafters will get rewarded. Our loot box drop of rewards. Yes, we are making it more fun to eat glass. Crafters will also get a proof of learn credential that unlocks exclusive job opportunities in the Solana ecosystem and cred stablecoin rewards, as Sheila mentioned earlier. What do you guys think? How cool is that? I wish I got paid to get to study when I was younger and feel like I was playing a game while I was at it. Back to you, Sheila.
00:09:48.952 - 00:10:33.724, Speaker A: Thanks, Kevin. Wow. Don't you love his excitement and passion? See, you're laughing. And it's because metacrapters is the community of builders and creators who are rallying together to share their knowledge and passion for blockchain and problem solving. There's a reason we call it metacrafters or crafting meta. Beyond developer mentors or master crafters who help create courses and lessons for students. The Solenite solenite house visual style and aesthetic was crafted by designers in the Metacrafters community.
00:10:33.724 - 00:10:47.544, Speaker A: We launched a global competition this summer called the Metacrafters Creator cup. And now let's hear from our winners. Encodemas and Team Zevol.
00:10:49.204 - 00:11:15.096, Speaker E: Hello everyone. My name is Kelly and I'm also known as Encodimus online for my multimedia treasure hunts. But I'm here to say thank you to the Metacrafters team for choosing my entry as one of the winners in the Creators cup challenge. This opportunity is not lost on me. It is hugely appreciated. The chance to showcase my work at Solana Breakpoint is amazing to me. Such a huge shock.
00:11:15.096 - 00:11:26.744, Speaker E: And the chance that I get to come here and be here to share it with everyone is even greater. Thank you all so much to everyone at Medicrafters and all of Kuka. Thank you.
00:11:27.364 - 00:11:33.300, Speaker D: Greetings from the Philippines. My name is Mark Jerome Boabe. I'm Kobe Maligaya, also known as Vedark.
00:11:33.372 - 00:11:34.868, Speaker C: I'm Natalie Bel Osma.
00:11:34.956 - 00:11:48.460, Speaker D: I just would like to say thank you to Metacrafters for hosting the creator's cup challenge, choosing us as the winner, and then showcasing our work here at breakpoint. We will treasure this opportunity you have given us.
00:11:48.572 - 00:11:49.324, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:11:49.444 - 00:11:55.454, Speaker C: Thank you for giving us artists the opportunity to show what we are capable of.
00:11:57.314 - 00:12:03.374, Speaker A: Now let's look at what Encodemus submitted in the competition. It's pretty dope.
00:12:05.274 - 00:12:57.504, Speaker F: Welcome to Solania, the home of the Solonites. On our archipelago, we have found the perfect balance of magic and science, speed and safety, as well as reverence for history and innovation for the future. From Cloudbreak peak to the depths of the Gulf Stream, the power of our sun, Helios, shines over the wonders of this mecca of beauty and efficiency. We move at light speed. All citizens have their own archivers, hard at work in the proof of history archives housed in each dwelling in Solania. Here, the knowledge is shared. Please come join us.
00:12:57.504 - 00:13:01.544, Speaker F: See what you may learn in Solania.
00:13:05.004 - 00:13:43.644, Speaker A: And by the way, Kelly is right here today, all the way from Japan. Him out here to be at breakpoint in this audience to see the power of this amazing community. Kelly, please stand. Thank you. Let's effing go, guys. Visit Solana dot Medacrafters IO to enter our solenite academy, it's free to start. Crafters can learn and earn and land their next web3 job.
00:13:43.644 - 00:14:18.374, Speaker A: A few of our live instructors are actually here this weekend. They'd love to meet you. And if you're interested in being a soul proof master crafter, many of you devs out there, if you want to mentor or be a course creator and earn money through us, please come find us. Or here's a QR code for efficiency and you can visit mentors metacrafters IO to get in touch. Learning something new Kev is effing hard. We've been there. Building companies are hard.
00:14:18.374 - 00:15:05.740, Speaker A: Too many of you know that. So why not have fun with fellow crafters while doing it and earn creds or USDC? We're building a platform that brings top quality educators a sleek and pretty dope ux, as you saw Kevin showcase. More importantly, we are building a community. Web three is about equal access for you mentors and mastercrafters out there. We have to break down boundaries around educational access in order to train and advance more developers. The next generation of talent is out there, more likely than not, the most influential, game changing web3 builders. Some of you are looking at me.
00:15:05.740 - 00:15:45.908, Speaker A: You're out there. They're in this room right now. Kevin and I, along with our entire team at Medicrafters, are inspired by what Raj Gokul shared in an interview with me recently in my podcast, Web that's w three b apostrophe d. He said, we are not waiting around. It's a theme of the Solana ecosystem. If something is technically possible and people are here that can build it, even if it's risky, we're just going to go take a swing and see what happens. That's exactly what we're doing with metacrafters.
00:15:45.908 - 00:15:56.054, Speaker A: We are building for the builders of web3. That's you. We aren't waiting around, and we are proudly chewing glass while we're at it.
00:15:58.034 - 00:16:01.802, Speaker C: As a blockchain developer, I believe web3 is the future.
00:16:01.938 - 00:16:08.954, Speaker G: How we build the metaverse now will unlock unstoppable potential, experiences and advancements we can't even imagine.
00:16:09.074 - 00:16:22.162, Speaker H: It feels like we're on the brink of something huge, and there's so much to learn still. But learning something new is hard. It's a hundred times easier to learn something together. Accountability and support are necessary if we.
00:16:22.178 - 00:16:29.946, Speaker G: Really want blockchain to be successful and grow. We need tools to scale it. We need a way to train more creators, to bring web3 to more people.
00:16:30.130 - 00:16:45.860, Speaker A: Metacrafters were on a mission to advance 1 million web two devs to web3, where devs learn and earn and land web3 jobs. We are the platform for builders to learn. Learn from blockchain experts, earn creds, and get hired.
00:16:46.052 - 00:17:00.424, Speaker B: Join your chain's house and invest in skills you'll need to succeed. The Sola Knight house has just released soulproof courses where builders can learn JavaScript, rust, and earn rewards as they advance through the Solana track.
00:17:03.084 - 00:17:12.964, Speaker A: The Sola Knight House is the first to be designed by creators in our own communities. We're on a mission to advance 1 million web two devs to web3.
00:17:14.904 - 00:17:20.640, Speaker B: Our doors are officially open to devs ready to learn, earn, and land their next web3 job.
00:17:20.712 - 00:17:28.944, Speaker A: We'll see you there, metacrafters thank you. Come build this with us.
