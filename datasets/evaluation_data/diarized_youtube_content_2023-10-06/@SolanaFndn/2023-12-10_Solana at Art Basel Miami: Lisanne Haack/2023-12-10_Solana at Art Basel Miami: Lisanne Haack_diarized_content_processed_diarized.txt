00:00:01.960 - 00:00:51.714, Speaker A: I'm Lisanne Haack. I'm a visual abstract painter that works with all kinds of mediums to try to express whatever I can't express into words. Entering the NFT scene, I actually saw the amount of possibilities that I could do to create art, and I just wanted to experiment where I like to blend all the different mediums and kind of jump from one technique to another. The digital enables me to play around way more, more so I can go back to that and then go back to the canvas. So all of that is, like, part of the process. The studio here, it's almost a copy from my studio at home. I wanted the viewers or the visitors here to kind of see a little bit of the background, how a piece is graded.
00:00:51.714 - 00:01:36.164, Speaker A: I discovered Solana. I entered the space, and when I dropped my first series, I was amazed with the reception of everything. And that kind of, like, pushed me to create. The best thing about the Solana community is that they don't make me pick if I'm a digital artist or a traditional painter or a 3d modeler. I can be everything, and I can express in every way in every medium. I want people to understand that digital art is more than just a JPeg. Our channel.
