00:00:04.160 - 00:00:28.134, Speaker A: Hello. Today I'm joined by Andrea from Magicblock. So, please tell us, what are you building? Yeah, sure. Magicblock is a framework for on chain games on Solana. We build an end to end stack client to protocol cross platform to enable game developers and studio to build the next generation of games on Solana. Cool. So what's your favorite feature? Like, what is the coolest thing that you unlock? It has to be bolt, our own chain game engine.
00:00:28.134 - 00:00:44.224, Speaker A: We are about to release the first version with Anisias, which is basically a paradigm that made game more composable. And so that has to be my favorite part of this talk, for sure. Really cool. I can't wait to get my hands on this one. Yeah. Thank you very much for being here. Thanks for having me.
