00:00:00.480 - 00:00:46.334, Speaker A: I got so excited as crypto started taking off because Reddit is where I dove in. R bitcoin is the community that inspired me to first invest in Coinbase back in 2012. R Ethereum was the community that got me really excited about what could actually be done with programmable money and this concept of building an Internet that was decentralized and truly in the hands of all the people creating content. And now what I am seeing here, especially within the Solana community, is nothing short of awesome. And we can just cut to the chase. And one of the reasons why I'm here is to announce a collaboration that we're doing. I have a venture fund called 776.
00:00:46.334 - 00:01:12.554, Speaker A: We're earmarking with the Solana Foundation $50 million to to invest in the next wave of social built on Solana. Because I think this new world, we were debating whether to do the announcement at the start or at the end. I'm happy we did at the start. It's good vibes.
