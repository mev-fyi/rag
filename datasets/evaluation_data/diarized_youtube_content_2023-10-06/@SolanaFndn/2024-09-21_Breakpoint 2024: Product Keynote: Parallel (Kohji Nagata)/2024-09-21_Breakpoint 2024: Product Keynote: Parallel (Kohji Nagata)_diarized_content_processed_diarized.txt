00:00:09.960 - 00:00:46.135, Speaker A: Hey, guys. Parallel is a game about epic battles, and I'm currently fighting my own epic battle against food poisoning. So apologies that I need to reference my notes here. For those of you who know us, you probably think of us as a card game, or maybe just somebody who argues with Hearthstone players on the Internet. But parallels so much more than just trading cards. It's an epic story about the future of humanity and how we might end up in a battle against one another for control of the planet. I'm excited to introduce you to Colony.
00:00:46.135 - 00:01:44.275, Speaker A: It's a one and a half player survival sim game powered by Solana and optimized for the Solana phone. The goal is to work alongside your AI and other players to help your colony survive disasters while gathering rare resources that you, as the player, can extract. In 2022, we launched an avatar collection. What makes Colony so special is that instead of directly taking control of these characters, they will be given a brain powered by an advanced LLM and a personality fine tuned by you. They will make decisions and operate as an agent in the parallel universe, and you as a player, will act as their guide, helping them through challenging situations and over time, helping them learn and grow. You might wonder how some of this plays out on Chain. We're excited to be joining Solana.
00:01:44.275 - 00:02:35.625, Speaker A: The skills, stats, progression and items you acquire in the game and craft will live on Solana. We're still working out some of the details, but all of these core tenants will be tied back to the prime ecosystem. This will allow the agents to autonomously use prime to interact on Chain. We really want Colony to feel like an infinitely emergent space you can explore with your agent through our game. The the world and the challenges will evolve around you and you'll need to work with your agent to find creative solutions, fending off pirates, raiders and environmental threats. You will work with your agent and alongside other the players of Excuse me. And alongside other agents belonging to other players in order to survive and thrive.
00:02:35.625 - 00:03:34.565, Speaker A: I want to tell you a quick story about what has been happening in some of our colony tests. We had a colony that was suffering from essentially mass depression, and one of the players told its colonists a story about how when they were young, their mother used to brew them mint tea and that would help sort of bring up their mood. And before this, mint tea wasn't something that existed within colony, but that particular colonist went to our dungeon master LLM and said, hey, is mint tea something that can exist within the parallel world? It said, yes. They were able to purchase mint seeds from the store grow mint and brew mint tea. And then from that point forward, mint tea was something that existed in Colony. And it's just sort of those personal experiences that you can bring to your avatar that will change the game for everybody else who plays. Now here's a short teaser of Colony.
00:03:44.685 - 00:04:02.775, Speaker B: Welcome to the Colony player. Since our last update on the game, our teams have made great progress all around. Colony is now fully playable on both iOS and Android devices. We have created richer worlds, expanded our.
00:04:02.815 - 00:04:04.195, Speaker A: Avatars collection.
00:04:06.415 - 00:04:21.915, Speaker B: And designed new and engaging NPCs you'll interact with. There are now many more activities and challenges waiting for you. We look forward to welcoming you to Colony very soon.
00:04:29.225 - 00:04:53.855, Speaker A: We're still fine tuning some of the game to make it as fun and engaging as possible, but we're excited to say that we're on track for a closed Alpha early 2025. And if anyone's interested, come find me. I actually have it running on my phone. I can show you a bit more than what was in the video. So just, I don't know, follow us on socials, join our discord and yeah, just be ready to experience the future. Thanks for having me guys.
