00:00:06.200 - 00:00:46.175, Speaker A: Hello. I'm going to start off with a hard truth. Web3 promised you ownership over the products you use, the things you believe in instead. Today you're being used as exit liquidity. The best teams follow an unspoken rulebook. Multiple private rounds by VC's points program to showcase adoption day one coordinated centralized exchange listings with market makers who control most of the float and drive and promote volume. That with token unlocks leads to down only price action.
00:00:46.175 - 00:01:28.215, Speaker A: This system is spawned by misaligned incentives. The result? Token prices inhibit community formation. Retail investors are left burned and disillusioned, exiting the ecosystem en masse. VC's constantly evaluating exit liquidity options. They don't want to be the last one holding the bag. The crypto fundraising system isn't just broken, it's toxic. You have to ask yourself, is this really the future of finance? If you can remember, there was a dream and that dream looked like accessible early rounds based on value, you can bring in things you believe in.
00:01:28.215 - 00:01:59.705, Speaker A: Not only for the elite. Rewarding value based on merit, not net wealth. Fair price discovery, not disconnected, fully diluted valuations. And investors and projects alike held accountable. It's a legion of value add individuals and groups, community VC projects working together to create something beautiful. However, this hasn't been possible. There's no clarity on legal legislation.
00:01:59.705 - 00:02:20.855, Speaker A: There's no way to say if investors are good or bad en mass. And there's absolutely zero accountability for many projects and for almost all investors. Until now. Introducing Legion. It's regulatory compliant. It supports pre TGE fundraising. So before tokens even launched as well as token launches.
00:02:20.855 - 00:02:58.793, Speaker A: Not a good looking site. The unlock the enabler. Much like in 2018 how regulation shattered the ICO landscape. Today Mikael is here to revive the idea the ethos of initial coin offerings. This new EU focused regulation allows teams from anywhere to fully compliantly raise and sell tokens to anyone in eu, qualified or not. Pre liquid token or token launches. The best projects can now raise fully compliantly again from the users that use the products as well as vc.
00:02:58.793 - 00:03:47.009, Speaker A: At the same time, however, it's not just about compliance, it's about better quality. The Legion reputation system ensures no bots, sybils and value extraction, ensuring you get very high quality value add network participants as part of your token holders and your equity holders. It keeps those investors accountable as well as projects for the founders. We aim to minimize overhead while maximizing the value per dollar invested. If you participate in an ecosystem and you bring value, Legion is your chance to make it. Let's have a quick look at Legion in action. So I'm a new user onboarding to the platform here I can come connect social accounts if I like.
00:03:47.009 - 00:04:23.253, Speaker A: This is fed in to kick off my initial Legion score my reputation layer I can connect wallets to show my on chain activity. Am I a perps user? Do I play with meme coins, etc. You can connect to developer your GitHub if you like. For contribution there's some compliance checks, we capture some information. Are you active? Are you a passive investor? What's your main value add and why? You can fill out this more later on. You also have an option to showcase some of your achievements both on chain, both clout or developer. Once you've landed you can see any investment.
00:04:23.253 - 00:04:51.325, Speaker A: You can track them. From here you can complete more of a detailed investor profile. We introduce this two way opt in that you typically get in private markets and bring it to the public markets. This is an example of investor profile typical check size, main value add what I'm looking for. You can also showcase if someone's chosen to make something public, their achievements. In this particular case contributing to a GitHub repo and being followed by Laura Shin. Of course you can track investments as well.
00:04:51.325 - 00:05:13.465, Speaker A: That's just a quick sneak peek and I'm excited to announce that compliant ICOs are coming to Solana very soon. If this excites you, follow Us Join the Legion at Legion CC or legiondot CC on Farcaster or Twitter. Thank you very much.
