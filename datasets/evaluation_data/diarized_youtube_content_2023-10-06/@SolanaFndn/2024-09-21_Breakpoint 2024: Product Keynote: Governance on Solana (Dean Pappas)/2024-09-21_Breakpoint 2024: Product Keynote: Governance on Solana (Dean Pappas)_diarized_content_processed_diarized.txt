00:00:04.720 - 00:00:43.765, Speaker A: Hello. So we're talking about governance. The governance ecosystem on Solana Governance has three main components. Measuring sentiment, how we come to decisions together as an organization, stakeholder engagement. Why do I even care to be an active voter in Treasury Management? How do we actually do things with these assets? On most chains, you've got one option in each of those quadrants and they kind of clunky speak to each other. They're not all on chain. It works on Solana because of composability.
00:00:43.765 - 00:01:15.005, Speaker A: Realms touches every single one of these protocols. We have multiple options across them. One of the ones that I'm very big fan of outside of realms, obviously is Metadao on the sentiment side. And I am a huge fan of Symmetry on the treasury management side. And of course, Jupiter and Bonk have done wonders in voter participation. Right now, Solana Governance is breaking records. We have the most voter participation across all daos, across all ecosystems.
00:01:15.005 - 00:01:56.573, Speaker A: We have two of the biggest DAOs by TVL and with greed, we had the most proposals of any DAO ever in history. Yeah, right now there are only five voting types I have on this slide, but trust me, there are many more. As long as you have a token or an NFT or some sort of on chain marker, you can create any kind of voting system you can think of. Most of this is done on realms. 97% of DAOs on Solana are on realms. $1.5 billion worth of TVL resides in realms treasuries.
00:01:56.573 - 00:02:25.955, Speaker A: Here you can make a dao within one minute and you can set up proposals that will execute a transaction the moment the vote is completed. And you can see that this is all done because of composability. Look how many different integrations there are. They're not all there. And there's many more. So how does this all work? You can create multiple wallets with different rules, different roles, different permissions for each wallet. All of it is transparent.
00:02:25.955 - 00:03:01.105, Speaker A: You can see every single voter, what they're doing, what they voted on, how they feel about their different proposals, and you can even hide it if you want to. Readable instructions. This is very important. You need to know what you're voting on. We have an ever growing library translating what the instructions actually do. And you can have warnings on them so that way voters know that if they vote on this one, it's going to do something critical to the dao. Of course, there's certain governance features that are only possible on Solana.
00:03:01.105 - 00:03:33.927, Speaker A: One of my favorite blinks. You can vote directly from Twitter. You can set up vesting grants. And if someone isn't doing their job or meeting their milestones, the Dao can vote to claw it back. This is one of the pet peeves I have and I love this feature set. If you are in the Dao, please for the love of God, stop doing swaps through multisigs. It's not decentralized and it's clunky.
00:03:33.927 - 00:03:55.567, Speaker A: We have two ways to go into the future with Realms. One, the Mango Delegate account. You set up a treasurer. They can trade whenever they want and they can only withdraw back to the dao. Say you want to get even more decentralized, get rid of a treasurer. The Dao votes on portfolio management through symmetry. It automatically rebalances the portfolio.
00:03:55.567 - 00:04:30.385, Speaker A: It automatically puts the assets into defi yield. This is the most decentralized way for a dao to manage its treasury. Of course, the coolest experiment in governance is Futar Key. That's also only on Solana, Metadao and Helium and Jupiter have shown that. You know what, if we don't have the tools, we can easily build them ourselves. With their own custom built governance systems. Mango, an exchange has a really cool way of doing a token listing.
00:04:30.385 - 00:04:58.085, Speaker A: If any of you have a token and you want to get it listed on an exchange, you know you have to pay a token fee, usually a listing fee. Here you set up a dao proposal. Ask the Mango Dao. Hey, do you guys want our token? So if you have a token and you want to get listed on a big exchange, you should look at Mango Bonk. They've used the Realm's new voter UI to increase voter participation. 10x and marinade. Michael was here before.
00:04:58.085 - 00:05:34.395, Speaker A: If you are a Marinade governance holder, you can choose how Marinade actually delegates its stake across the different validators. There are a lot more features. This is all I could fit on this slide before making it unruly, literally. We're outside of the area of trying to build new tooling. We're now in the exploration area, where we need to work with universities, where we need to work with policymakers to try to start experimenting on what's possible. Athens Dao is going to happen this year again where we only talk about governance. It's going to be in Athens, Greece in January.
00:05:34.395 - 00:06:26.635, Speaker A: Now I want to show you a quick slide, a quick video of some of the new UIs coming out in Realms later this year so you can start building today. The discord is like the treasure trove of all of our documentation. Also, we have Docs Realms. Today I'm going to be around. All this is open source, so reach out, start building. Really? Solana is the home of governance. Thank you.
