00:00:00.320 - 00:00:36.054, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to this week's episode of the Solana Changelog. I'm Colin, and I'm joined by my colleague Joe from the developer relations team at Solana foundation. And I guess, quick shout outs. The first one is the stack exchange. And yes, we do have our own stack exchange where people go and both ask questions and also provide answers for them for, like, typical issues that they're having whilst developing on Solana. Just want to remind everybody to go there, contribute to it. Make sure you're upvoting both good questions and answers, because it is actually an incredible resource for building on Solana.
00:00:36.794 - 00:01:03.986, Speaker B: Yeah, seriously, guys, I mean, think about in the future when you could just look up any kind of error you're facing or like, something funny that you've run into, like you can do with most really popular frameworks and things like that in web two. You'll be able to find those answers just, like, through Google. You know, we really want to see that activity, and there's also a lot of really great resources on there as far as the people on there from Solana and from different ecosystem partners. So totally use that.
00:01:04.130 - 00:01:24.652, Speaker A: One thing I also find interesting is that even sometimes I go to the stack exchange for a particular question, and I found that either I had asked the question myself previously, or I've even given the answer myself previously. But, yeah, just, like, the nature of building stuff, you kind of, like, forget things as you go along. So, yeah, so it's like an incredible, long lasting resource. So, yeah, definitely contribute to that.
00:01:24.748 - 00:02:07.886, Speaker B: The more the merrier, you know, comes up more than once. There you go. Another cool thing, too, to mention at the beginning here is if you guys are going to the next hacker house in Lisbon, or if you are going to attend any hacker houses in the future, maybe even other events, we are actually starting to use a bounty board provided by heavy duty builders, and these guys have really done a lot of great work. And basically what you'll be able to do is you'll be able to compete in challenges and earn points and kind of, like, stack up on the leaderboard and, like, all while kind of learning about Solana, you know, like, it's. There's some interesting challenges. Like, some are, like, take a look at some research and, like, answer some questions. Some are like, deploy a program that does a certain thing.
00:02:07.886 - 00:02:14.838, Speaker B: So it's really fun stuff. And, like, it gives you some cool stuff to do and learn while you're at a hacker house or something like that, really.
00:02:14.886 - 00:02:40.644, Speaker A: And it's like, who doesn't like to collect, like, cool, magic Internet points. Yeah, it was also, like, quite cool because I think we ran this in both hackathons that happened last week. One was cow hacks, the other one was hects. Don't want to gloat, but my university did beat Joe. So, yeah, it's kind of like a nice gamification as well, just by learning and building on Solana.
00:02:41.224 - 00:02:43.084, Speaker B: I'll get you guys next time, don't worry.
00:02:43.424 - 00:03:38.900, Speaker A: Yeah, you can try onto proposals. We have one that is the Lamport withdrawal authority. And I think this one is kind of like an interesting one because it's something that was actually proposed by a community member, which goes to show, like, proposals to changes on the network or validate a client doesn't only have to come from the core engineers. We in the community can actually also suggest these proposals and kind of get feedback from the core contributors to see what they think about it. And, yeah, this one in particular was around having a particular authority key just for withdrawing lan ports, because I think currently it's using the withdrawal authority. And this particular member think that, yeah, it's something that can probably introduce some kind of, like, risk because that withdrawal authority is used for so many things. They just want a particular key just to withdraw lan ports.
00:03:38.900 - 00:03:48.494, Speaker A: And again, this is just in discussion. And, yeah, you can kind of go to the GitHub to kind of see the content comments that the core contributors have had towards that.
00:03:48.874 - 00:04:23.752, Speaker B: That is pretty cool, though, if you think about it. I mean, you've got a community member proposing a new proposal that engineers are then, like, jamming on and, like, speaking to them about through the GitHub comments. And, like, this is obviously not the first time this happened. This happens a lot. So, like, it just goes to show that if you have a good idea and you really know, like, your stuff about at least the particular source that you're going to be proposing about, you can submit proposals and they'll actually get reviewed. And if it's legitimate and if it's a cool idea, like, the conversation will flow. It's kind of interesting, you know?
00:04:23.888 - 00:04:28.528, Speaker A: Yep. That's just the. Yep. I was just about to say the same thing. The beauty of open source.
00:04:28.696 - 00:04:49.078, Speaker B: Exactly right. Exactly right. So anyway, let's dive into some commits. So the first commit that I want to cover, we talked about it last week a little bit, the immutable deploy. So it's the Solana deploy command versus Solana program deploy. Last week we mentioned that you're going to be moved to program deploy. Right.
00:04:49.078 - 00:05:05.474, Speaker B: Because you're going to have to be using the upgradeable loader. That's officially done. Now. When that release comes out, that command will no longer be active. The Solano deploy. So last week was kind of like in testing. Now you got to use Solana program deploy and then you're good to go.
00:05:06.014 - 00:05:29.684, Speaker A: Oh yeah. And I think I also saw in that particular, uh, pr that you can actually still deploy immutable programs. You just have to pass the final, like Dash, dash final CLI argument for that. So, yeah, it's like you don't actually lose anything. Yeah. By migrating to Solana program deploy, it's just the newer, bigger, better version. Interesting.
00:05:29.684 - 00:05:55.964, Speaker A: Yeah. And the other commit that kind of caught my eye was around error messages. I mean, who doesn't love a good error message? Yeah. So yeah, doing the Lord's work on that. So yeah, there's improved error messages from the RPC. One instance of that was like the get FIFA message that kind of just returned an error of invalid length. But now you actually have a more specific issue of what actually occurred.
00:05:55.964 - 00:06:06.584, Speaker A: So like, yeah, I mean, we probably spend most of our time debugging code and figuring out what error messages actually mean. So anything to make that clear and better is like, it's a solid win.
00:06:06.894 - 00:06:48.302, Speaker B: Oh my gosh. Yeah, that's so good. That's great. And then if we want to get down to the resources. Now, another cool thing that we saw was Acheron crypto, as he goes by, who created solpgs on playground that we've actually covered a few times on here, that platform that ID now supports tutorials. So the proposal or the front end work, like the typescript stuff, like the support for different client side code has come a long way and now you can actually create a tutorial and provide a link where your tutorial comes up. Like you've got your test code and you've got like some docs about it and people can like interact with your tutorial.
00:06:48.302 - 00:06:49.910, Speaker B: Super cool stuff. Do you see that?
00:06:49.942 - 00:07:23.400, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I saw that and I think it's a huge deal because I think, yeah, it just kind of like makes the process of, I think not even just about onboarding new developers, but like teaching online is just going to go up a whole other level. Because it's not that, it's just tutorials, it's actually interactive tutorials as well, where based on certain things that the user has done, you can run some automated commands behind that. And I think even probably for our workshops, this is going to be a game changer. So shout out to Archeron for working on that. Brilliant.
00:07:23.472 - 00:07:35.844, Speaker B: Yeah. Workshops, all that. And plus, people are very familiar with these kinds of tools from web two, a lot of web based tutorials with ides, like all in one. And now we have one for Solana.
00:07:36.004 - 00:07:42.756, Speaker A: Pretty cool. Yep. Super dope. And yep, the Solana ecosystem is just hot. And it continues to get hotter with all of these changes.
00:07:42.900 - 00:07:43.876, Speaker B: That's right.
00:07:44.060 - 00:07:56.484, Speaker A: Yep. That wraps it off for this week of the Solana Changelog. I'm Colin, and again, this is my colleague Jo, and join us next week to hear the roundup of the changes. See you next time. Ciao.
