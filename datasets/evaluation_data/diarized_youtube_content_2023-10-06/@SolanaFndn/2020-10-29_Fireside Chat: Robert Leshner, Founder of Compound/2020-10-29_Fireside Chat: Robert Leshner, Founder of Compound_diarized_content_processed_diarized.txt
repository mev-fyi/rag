00:00:00.840 - 00:00:01.380, Speaker A: Hey.
00:00:04.054 - 00:00:05.942, Speaker B: And we're live.
00:00:05.998 - 00:00:09.062, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Welcome.
00:00:09.118 - 00:00:39.720, Speaker B: Welcome to the fourth event of the Solana wormhole hackathon. We have a really exciting guest today. We have Robert Lechner, who is the founder of Compound. He's going to be doing a 30, 45 minutes deep dive into all things compound. There's been a lot of exciting things going on, and so him and Tully are just going to have a friendly chat about it all. Quick reminder, registrations for the slender wormhole hackathon officially ended last night. And so hacking has officially, officially commenced as of.
00:00:39.720 - 00:00:55.584, Speaker B: As of this morning, and Will. Will go until the 14th. So we're excited to see what everyone ends up building. And two quick notes. There's a chat tab where you can drop any public communications. And we also have a questions tab if you have any questions, for Robert throughout the chat.
00:00:55.624 - 00:00:56.028, Speaker A: And.
00:00:56.136 - 00:01:01.236, Speaker B: And we'll take the last ten minutes to answer them all for you. So I'm gonna.
00:01:01.260 - 00:01:03.628, Speaker A: I'm gonna jump off. Totally. And I will.
00:01:03.796 - 00:01:04.984, Speaker B: I'll leave it to you.
00:01:05.564 - 00:01:19.064, Speaker A: Cool. Awesome. Really good to connect with you, Robert. It's awesome to have you here. So kind of like, do you want to give a brief background how you ended up in crypto and, like, how you started compound?
00:01:19.524 - 00:01:30.716, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, I have always been, in my heart, a little bit of mix between a finance person and a builder.
00:01:30.820 - 00:01:41.144, Speaker D: I started my career in finance working in interest rate markets, and had a lot of fun. Learned a lot, got really into the math and science of all of that.
00:01:41.724 - 00:01:43.308, Speaker C: And then along the way moved out.
00:01:43.316 - 00:02:31.924, Speaker D: To California and became a traditional sort of venture backed software founder and always was observing crypto from the sidelines. So started looking at bitcoin back in the day, did a little bit of mining in 2013, but never beyond just being a hobbyist. And then when ethereum came out, it was sort of an aha moment for me because I said, oh, you can actually program assets and value. Now, that's exciting to me. I like the idea of a new currency that would compete with existing currencies. But the idea that you could have essentially, like, a Turing complete programming platform on a blockchain to route logic and assets and wealth was mind blowing to me. I said, I have to do this immediately.
00:02:31.924 - 00:03:04.412, Speaker D: Immediately jumped in and basically built what was missing in the space, in my opinion, and also what I knew, which was creating interest rate markets for crypto assets. This started in 2017. It was before the word DeFi was a word, yet back then it was, hey, we can actually create an entirely functioning financial market running on a blockchain? That's crazy. Let's see if it even works. When we started, we had no idea.
00:03:04.428 - 00:03:05.492, Speaker C: If it would even work.
00:03:05.628 - 00:03:18.946, Speaker D: A lot of this was completely untested. No one was really building entirely new financial markets, you know, as executable autonomous code. And so, you know, it's been quite the journey since we've basically, you know.
00:03:18.970 - 00:03:24.854, Speaker C: Been operating for three years. And, you know, we're here now with two and a half billion dollars of assets supplied to compound.
00:03:25.194 - 00:03:30.654, Speaker A: Did you instantly think of it as a marketplace, as, like, a financial marketplace?
00:03:31.074 - 00:03:45.196, Speaker C: Yeah, we did. So, you know, early on, you know, from the very earliest moments, like, all right, well, how do you even build market on a blockchain? Well, we have to build the whole stack. We have to build a market.
00:03:45.260 - 00:03:47.904, Speaker D: We have to build an application.
00:03:48.244 - 00:03:49.212, Speaker C: If you go all the way back.
00:03:49.228 - 00:04:31.400, Speaker D: There'S designs for a mobile app to access compound. And over time, very early in 2017, we figured out the open nature of building on a blockchain means that we can just focus on one specific piece, which is creating a market and, like, making it accessible to other application developers and interfaces and, like, builders and, you know, really narrow in on just doing, like, one thing extremely specifically and very simply, and that's just creating an interest rate market. And it wasn't intuitive at first. Like, you know, day zero, we didn't get that. It took us, like, a couple, like, months of, like, just like, tinkering in the garage, you know, to realize that.
00:04:31.432 - 00:04:32.444, Speaker C: That was, like, possible.
00:04:34.194 - 00:05:31.754, Speaker A: That's super cool. Like, I had, like, I think similar, like, education as an engineer at Qualcomm. I, like, traded on the side, like, you know, interactive broker style trading with an API and never made, like, any money, just kind of. But I was fascinated by, like, smart contracts platforms when Ethereum came out because thought that you could kind of like, bolt Nasdaq on top of it. Like, didn't really think through all the implications of this until maybe like a year ago where as we were building the system, you know, you kind of start getting into the nitty gritty of it. How did the mechanics of the stuff actually works? And as you described, I think it's been pretty amazing for me to see how small pieces that are just a small thing, just, just a central limit order book or just a, you know, just a lending market or just an AMM can now all function together.
00:05:33.174 - 00:06:35.364, Speaker C: Yeah, it's so cool to watch it all unfold and, like, the research and discovery part and, like, learning, like, the nuances of the blockchain were like, you know, the first six months to a year of what we were doing, like, now, you know, in 2020, it's like, there's certain to be, like, very common patterns of, like, how you build an application. It's like there's shortcuts. It's like, oh, now everyone has pools of assets, and everyone is using some shorthand techniques to make a system work for thousands of users, as opposed to iterating over individual addresses or accounts and all these things, using indices to track value. But when we had to learn all of this stuff in 2017, there was nothing like, in the wild yet. Now, I envy Defi founders who are able to look at this whole spectrum of products that exist and say, okay, this is great. I like that. Let me cherry pick the best pieces from all these different things, as opposed to inventing everything for the first time.
00:06:35.484 - 00:07:09.196, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. This was also, like, I think people forget how early 2017 was for DeFi because everybody was talking about stuff of value that was, like, the only thing. And then stable coins were, like, just. Just starting to come out. And I was in this group, this Dex group on Telegram, and I was like, hey, Solana can kind of hit Nasdaq level speeds. I think we can actually run, like, a whole thing there. Do real price discovery, and, like, Kyle, like, multicoint.
00:07:09.196 - 00:07:16.174, Speaker A: Like, our biggest investor was like, dexes are dead. Don't worry. Don't focus on that. It's really funny.
00:07:16.364 - 00:07:18.090, Speaker C: Yeah, well, now they're feedback.
00:07:18.162 - 00:07:47.744, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, now I think, like, I just honestly believe that, like, if you have a system that can do state transitions as fast as the news, that's as fast as a market needs to be, and, like, these, these systems, like, can achieve that speed. We can actually have open, permissionless systems that have as good of a price as a centralized one, and that means that there's no need for these centralized services, you know, for the most part, for the big. For the big use case.
00:07:48.284 - 00:07:55.904, Speaker C: Yeah. If it wasn't, you know, going to be a Dex, what did he encourage you to, you know, focus on instead, as the first application instead of taking.
00:07:58.324 - 00:08:31.400, Speaker A: He didn't have that much foresight, but that was his sentiment. And then I think he. The idea of a fast blockchain was intriguing in itself, that we could kind of are like, kind of secret sauce. Like, I think, like, these systems are really hard, and when you bet on solving two or three computer science problems, you're kind of aggregating risk. You know, you're compounding the risk, right? Like, oh, oops. Hey, Austin, we. Oh, you're still there.
00:08:31.400 - 00:08:32.296, Speaker A: Right, okay.
00:08:32.440 - 00:08:34.976, Speaker C: I maximize your screen.
00:08:35.040 - 00:08:35.216, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:35.240 - 00:08:35.884, Speaker C: Okay.
00:08:36.824 - 00:09:05.374, Speaker A: Yeah. And like we got super lucky with a single. Solving a computer science problem just by sheer dumb luck. Was this like idea of using a clock outside of consensus, like actually constructing it. And the rest is just hard engineering problems. And I think that's why we've been fairly quick at building stuff and shipping it. But like, when you have like more complicated systems where unknown, unknown computer science problems, it just becomes harder and harder to estimate when anything gets done.
00:09:07.954 - 00:09:41.676, Speaker C: Yeah. Having a clock, I mean, it's such a hilariously simple example. The amount of times that we've struggled with very basic blockchain primitive things so far have been like, oh, there's not a clock. It's sort of like a consensus for miners. And it's like how do you build and measure interest rates over time in this specific nuance of how blockchain actually operates? Right. So that's what I love about sort of like going to like the most primitive level and like trying to unlock new functionality.
00:09:41.860 - 00:10:24.044, Speaker A: These are like hard problems, like almost philosophical to some extent. How do we as humans define time, right? Like there's, we've built a bunch of oracles, right? Like based on the sun, position of the sun and the sky and science, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This has been like an interesting experience. Cause I feel like we're taking the old world and rebuilding it much, much faster, even in some ways. Like governance. We went through 2000 years of governance evolution, I think in blockchain in a span of a decade.
00:10:24.744 - 00:10:45.944, Speaker C: We went through 20 years of R and D in, you know, a very small amount of time. You know, like, I'm just amazed at how much has happened like two or three years in terms of just like knowledge about how this stuff works and seeing new use cases and, you know, applications. Like, it feels like golden era. That's beginning right now.
00:10:46.484 - 00:10:58.834, Speaker A: You guys, I think have been a huge part of it. I'm not in the even just the use case itself that you're famous for, which is the interest rate, but I think on the governance side as well. Did you anticipate that being so important?
00:10:59.654 - 00:11:47.198, Speaker C: Sort of. So day zero, we basically had this vision where we said, okay, if you're going to build a financial market on a blockchain, the goal of it is that it runs on its own forever. And we knew there was going to have to be this giant leap between starting off as six engineers in an attic in like a building in San Francisco. Like, that's literally how we started. So like there's a financial market that just runs on its own forever, right? And we knew there was going to be this, like, gap between those two things, but early on, we just, like, waved our hands in the air. We're like, oh, one day there'll be, like, a dao or something that, like, manages it, like, the very, very first versions of the white paper. Like, oh, we'll figure out how to have it run on its own.
00:11:47.198 - 00:12:33.038, Speaker C: You're like, well, we'll discover and research in science, all of that later. The more important thing is, like, getting out a proof of concept, seeing if it works, how it works, like, how is it composable with other applications? Like, what happens next before making it permanent and, like, autonomous, like, forever. So we knew it was extremely important. We just didn't know what it was supposed to look like or what it supposed to be. And I actually think, like, at the end of the day, like, the goal is just make it run forever, right? And, like, governance is just, like, one of the words that gets used for, like, how do you make it, you know, sort of one upgradeable so I can improve because, like, it's just completely hardened. It's not going to run forever. It's going to be obsoleted in, like, two years.
00:12:33.038 - 00:13:23.866, Speaker C: So one is like, how does it improve? And the second is like, how can you make it so that it's essentially censorship resistant? Or, like, one person or one party can't just mess up the whole shot, right? Like, those are the two virtues. Like, they both have to exist. And, like, we looked at bitcoin as, like, a reference in a lot of ways because, like, bitcoin evolves not quickly by any stretch of the United nations, but, like, it evolves, right? And at this point, it's completely hardened. And so, like, we looked at other systems where they could evolve extremely fast. They weren't hardened at all. And there's this, like, trade off and this, like, competition between these two. So I think every, like, protocol or application or whatever needs to find its own, like, you know, trade off that it wants between, like, you know, upgradability and no one can mess it up.
00:13:23.866 - 00:13:56.790, Speaker C: And, like, it's not perfect. You can't have both, like, extremes completely. That's, like, I think, you know, technologically impossible at this moment. But we designed a governance processing system that we thought best achieved that for our specific application. And so I also don't think any of this is one size fits all. What works for one protocol or application isn't ideal for another protocol or application. What works for one blockchain isn't ideal for another blockchain and all these things, but I think we developed a lot of early research that other teams can learn from.
00:13:56.790 - 00:14:14.204, Speaker C: And again, cherry pick the best people pieces from and, like, learn from and, like, you know, like, apply them in new and interesting ways. We basically have, you know, what I believe to be like, a really good effort to make a system that's able to evolve and one party can't just mess it up or many.
00:14:14.584 - 00:14:37.144, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's awesome. I love how open you guys are about like building and letting other people build, like with your, with the, with your research. Right. I mean, that's really hard for, like, to balance that as a startup founder where you're working your ass off in a dingy, you know, 500 startup office. Right. Like on ramen. Right.
00:14:37.144 - 00:14:50.244, Speaker A: And then somebody uses your code. But it is, I think, humbling how quickly, like, the space flourishes because of that. Like, it makes me feel like I'm a small, you know, a small piece, but in a very important system.
00:14:50.824 - 00:15:36.418, Speaker C: Yeah. And, like, I kind of like, firmly believe in some of the sort of like, open source virtues, which is like, you know, one, the entire industry moving forward is good for both, you know, compound the protocol, compound engineers who originally built it. Like all these things, like, if the whole industry moves forward, like, that's a positive. Like a rising tide lifts all this. Right? Like, yeah, like anything we can do to, like, help just the whole industry go up is like a good thing. Like, even if, like, it doesn't necessarily necessarily directly add value us, it might indirectly add value to us. And the second is that like, even as people like, take some of the things we built, we think that it's not going to actually harm us.
00:15:36.418 - 00:16:11.764, Speaker C: We actually think that. All right, having more people using the governance tool and the framework, I don't see how it really harms companies. Even having direct works of compound, I don't like, think harm, combat. Right. It draws attention back to the original in a lot of ways. I'm a huge proponent of sharing. I think there's a lot of other approaches you can take, but I think just really making research available, making code available, doing all of these things is extremely positive for everybody and hopefully comes back to us in delightful ways.
00:16:12.144 - 00:16:24.204, Speaker A: That's awesome. I am like, so happy to see, like, open source ethos and projects actually win in the space over anyone that's building proprietary stuff. I don't even remember their names anymore.
00:16:26.664 - 00:17:24.474, Speaker C: And, like, there will be, you know, completely proprietary things that get built in this one of the scariest things is when like, you know, we have a massive technological incumbent like Google and Apple, Facebook and Amazon that wants to create a system like this. We're not going to have this same openness right at the stage we're at right now. I think it's a completely different framework than when one of those incumbents is really trying to compete against the ecosystem. So I am very curious to see how all this plays out. One of my core hypotheses is that there's going to be development coming from massive technological incumbents over the next couple of years. We already see it, some of the largest incumbents. We're starting to see it very quietly from some of the largest tech incumbents.
00:17:24.474 - 00:17:49.214, Speaker C: And so it's possible, and I hope that this sort of opens source like community builds, tools that get the critical mass and scale and integration to the point that they're not able to be disrupted. Otherwise we might be left with one of the virtues that brought so many people into the space being co opted. So I'm very curious to watch how this unfolds.
00:17:49.554 - 00:17:59.594, Speaker A: Yeah, me too. I hope we don't have the Google Android being the de facto Linux. Right. Like that. That happening to the space would be really sad.
00:17:59.934 - 00:18:04.794, Speaker C: It's possible though, like we're still so early that that's a very distinct possible.
00:18:07.774 - 00:18:42.994, Speaker A: I think like some of the nuances on finance are especially lending are really tough to get. Like we kind of live in a world where we have this idea of, you know, like a credit score oracle, that's fairly well trusted. Right? Like a company can kind of use it and give me credit and do you think that's going to be. A lot of people have tried this, right? Like Jane. And it's just too hard. Is that because that problem due to adoption problem, like they're just too early or is it just impossible? Like in your mind?
00:18:43.414 - 00:19:36.448, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great question. It's fun. Looked again at the limitations of like what's kind of possible on a blockchain. And we had to build a system that was completely self insulated where it was like, all right, the system only relies on the data of the users that bring value into the system, period. And we have to build something that works in that context. The system we designed was, you can borrow with an over collateralized position why we don't have to know anything about you. It's autonomous, it's instant, it's very easy to implement on the blockchain, but really with no access to the outside world and so everything we did from, like, you know, from the earliest stages of research, you know, we had to rule out, you know, using like, you know, the means of data that exists out there.
00:19:36.448 - 00:20:04.830, Speaker C: And like, credit decisions in the real world are now run with like, massive amounts of data information. I think at some point we might get like, hybrids where like, you know, outside of a block thing, where, by the way, on any blockchain, storage is expensive. You know, memory is expensive. Like, you know, everything is expensive. And like, you know, even on Solana, on every blockchain, right, relative to, you know, you have massive, you know, data centers and servers. Yeah. Right.
00:20:04.830 - 00:20:53.534, Speaker C: So I think at some point we might, like, wind up with these very interesting hybrids where you have data centers with just unlimited amounts of information able to crank the best decisions, but that serve essentially as APIs to blockchain. We might see all these things, and we're going to see lots of experimentation right now on chain. There's really just no good way to do anything that's not completely encapsulated in one system. Over collateralized borrowing is sort of a must for how compound operates, because each user brings all the value that's necessary into the protocol. But one day we might see a system where something like compound accesses information based on terabytes of data.
00:20:56.394 - 00:21:41.574, Speaker A: I think, like, have you guys thought, did you ever have the thought, like, I had this recently, but kind of watching circle and some personalized tokens as an opportunity to build a marketplace for, effectively, my credit score. My personalized token can then be used without changing the compound. I can collateralize that thing to take to borrow against ETH, and that is effectively over collateralized loans. But from your perspective, it's over collateralized, but from my perspective, it's fractional because. Because I'm betting my reputation, so to speak. I think, like, there's some. Is that doable? Do you think? Do you think that'll, like.
00:21:42.674 - 00:22:07.794, Speaker C: Absolutely. And, like, someone will like, have like, a fork of compound one day that uses like, personal tokens, right? And like, what are personal tokens? There's so far only like ten of them, you know? Right. But like, a number of people have just said, I'm going to tokenize myself different ways. Some have said it's a share of future income. Some have said it's an hour of my time. Some have said, I don't know what this does yet, but here's my name as a token. You can buy it.
00:22:07.794 - 00:22:30.160, Speaker C: And that would be like a very cool, like, shortcut to having credit, let's say scalability of that I would question because people are so unique and they each have to do their own tokens that have done that, that would be a really fun sort of like shortback.
00:22:30.352 - 00:23:02.584, Speaker A: So if anyone's listening to this that wants to build something like that, it's be trivial to, like, issue a token and Solana to do that. And I think, like, my feeling of, like, what's building a layer one is like taking these unscalable things and seeing what happens if we just allow them to scale to, like, you know, a billion people, 100 million people, some absurd number, right? Like, I think, like, a bunch of stuff will fall over, but the things that will succeed, I think will be transformative to the rest of the world. Like it.
00:23:03.284 - 00:24:05.302, Speaker C: Absolutely. So, you know, one of the reasons why I think DeFi found such critical mass so early in product market and on Ethereum was it doesn't matter that it's somewhat expensive and somewhat stock, right? It just doesn't matter if you're doing financial transactions, whether it's trading or borrowing assets. If it takes 45 seconds and it costs you $3 compared to existing finance, that's like mind boggling that something can happen in 45 seconds, right? Like, because existing financial transactions are just like, in general, like, for doing large trades or large just so slow and so expensive. Right? But it crowds out, like, so many things that aren't worth spending that much money. Like games were one of the original ideas where it's like, oh, you put a game on the blockchain, it's like, not really. Right. Nobody would want to play a game where every interaction is, like, slow and expensive.
00:24:05.302 - 00:24:46.124, Speaker C: Right? So that's a use case that doesn't work when you are focusing on having something that's like, I would say, like, very, you know, secure and expensive to modify. So I think, like, changing that framework and saying, well, let's make things like, cheap and scalable, I think you're going to see entirely new use cases that just didn't exist. They don't fit, you know, with that prior framework. And so I think you might still see, like, you know, a bunch of things like staying put because it works, you know, when it, you know, takes 45 seconds to $3, but, you know, other things that just can't function in there can flourish.
00:24:50.544 - 00:25:07.664, Speaker A: Do you, like, do you think? I guess this is kind of like, what are you predicting about the future, like, the next couple years? I can't possibly imagine the Delta from 2017 to now. Anything could happen, right?
00:25:08.164 - 00:25:51.134, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the Delta from 2017 to 2020 is going to look similar to 2020 to 2023. I honestly think that in three years the whole space could look radically different. When we find what is Defi, you might have people saying like, oh, I'm going to use like the JP Morgan compound. I think that's likely. I think you're going to start to see people plugging into open, permissionless blockchains that you would never expect. I think it's going to unfold extremely quickly. I think some of it's going to displace existing players.
00:25:51.134 - 00:26:32.144, Speaker C: I think some of it's going to hundred x existing players. And I think it's, you know, one of those things that like, it's unknown unknowns. Like, I just know the world's gonna be very different in three years just because like this has been such like portal ground of like knowledge discovery. Like, we didn't even know how things were supposed to work three years ago. Now we have glimmers. Like, here's how you build like financial applications on a blockchain. So I think now that we know there's just so much hunger and curiosity from governments, large companies, everything went down to individual developers that I think we're going to see a lot of moving on.
00:26:35.084 - 00:27:14.756, Speaker A: Same, I agree with you. I think we've kind of broken through a lot of the tech barriers. The last two years have been really massive for not just R and D, but actual implementation of like kind of the bottlenecks. I think ourselves and our competitors have done a tremendous job in actually like shipping stuff and getting those ideas out to, you know, outlive. So I think it's going to really accelerate in terms like every boom brings people into the space, and this new boom, I think, is bringing new people into the space. And now they have like all those crazy ideas. They now have all the tools to actually go execute on them.
00:27:14.756 - 00:27:17.194, Speaker A: So they have more options than they need in a lot of away.
00:27:18.454 - 00:27:22.434, Speaker C: I think the next wave is going to be unbelievable.
00:27:23.534 - 00:27:43.714, Speaker A: There's a question that I'm kind of interested that's on the board, the breakdown between compound uniswap and cook swap and that composability. Is that part of your vision? How do you guys view it as part of you're planning on it? Is this a roadmap thing?
00:27:44.684 - 00:27:47.364, Speaker C: Sorry, can you be more specific? I guess.
00:27:47.524 - 00:27:57.704, Speaker A: Are you guys building, building interfaces and tools that expand on compensability? Or are you thinking more like insular? Like we're adding compound features?
00:27:58.004 - 00:28:58.726, Speaker C: Yeah, so, you know, we're focused on, you know, really on compounds. Knowing that the ecosystem itself builds composability in ways that we never could. So the thing that we're focused on is expanding the surface area of how many people are actually able to tweak compound the protocol. This financial market with $2 billion, we're trying to increase how many different teams and developers are able to expand on it, knowing that some of them are going to just mash it up. If you just mash it up with another system, we're really focused on just enabling that, you know, expansion. So a lot of the governance tools that we built are so that community members or, like, other teams or other projects can, like, actually, like, propose and implement core changes to the way compound works. And so we're kind of, like, focused on enabling the expansion as opposed to, like, building the expansion.
00:28:58.910 - 00:29:14.200, Speaker A: Got it. That's very similar to us. Right? Like. Like wormhole. Like this thing, it's a bridge built by a different team, by our community, and it bridges two networks. And to me, it's. This is kind of like when you have any.
00:29:14.200 - 00:29:32.354, Speaker A: When you have two ecosystems, the bridges will be built. Like, some. Somebody will go and do it simply because there's now, like, opportunity to move stuff across. Right. It's almost like, kind of. Kind of happens on its own. Yeah, but we're definitely excited to, like, support these folks.
00:29:32.354 - 00:30:11.294, Speaker A: One thing that I've been kind of thinking about, too, is, like, the protocols that are being built, there's often this kind of misconception that they're capital inefficient because of this over collateralization. But my theory is that since all these pieces are open, that the actual positions themselves are collateral, are valuable. If I deposit collateral and I get the token back, that token is fungible and tradable as well. Do you guys see that, like, do you guys see that as. As a more accurate form of accounting than, like, a book at, like, I don't know, wells Fargo or something like that?
00:30:11.414 - 00:30:38.934, Speaker C: Absolutely. I mean, absolutely. So it's funny because, you know, we've had three versions of compound so far, version zero, which nobody ever got to play with. It was really just R and D. Version one, which was like, you know, it was a monolithic, smart contract deployed on Ethereum. And it was very simple. It was, you can put a token into the box where you can borrow a token from the box once you've already supplied an asset.
00:30:38.934 - 00:31:45.454, Speaker C: And in version two, we increased the sort of programmability of the assets inside compounds by saying, when you have a balance inside the protocol, we give you a second token that represents your balance that you can transfer, that you can trade, that you can move into like cold storage, you can do whatever you want with so that you can easily move the balances inside the protocol. And you know, that on its own is like crazy. Like if you have a, you know, bank account at JP Morgan, like you can't program your balance, right? Like you can't move your balance there except like by using like very specific tools that they give you. But being able to like let any developer move the balances inside compound, that alone was like one of like the sort of like massive inflection points and sort of like adoption and utility where the actual core protocol does nothing different. Like it literally didn't change at all. All we said was, and once you have a balance inside of it, you can just move that balance. That's it.
00:31:45.454 - 00:31:48.690, Speaker C: And I think that is just so powerful.
00:31:48.882 - 00:32:26.278, Speaker A: So I am like becoming religious about this idea because I feel like this is akin to like building small programs in Unix that operate through pipes, right? Like if I put a token in, into something protocol, I want a token out, right? And that's reversible, right? And to me, like this paradigm I think is like if you can build your design, your protocols to match that, then you're kind of building, I think, robust and secure accounting systems, right, for like risk or something like that. For specific kinds of risk you are.
00:32:26.366 - 00:33:01.334, Speaker C: I mean, you know, and it's just funny that like a token standard became the way that people thought about it. Like it didn't even have to be like a token standard, right? But it's just a standard to say value in any system you want to account for. You can track and you can move program. It doesn't have to be a token standard. We use a token standard that already existed to represent balances inside compound. And it's becoming more of a thing that happens inside defi now. It's like, oh, you always put a token in, you get a token out.
00:33:01.334 - 00:33:12.394, Speaker C: But it didn't have to be that. It could have been an alternate standard where we could have said, oh, there's a new set of functions called, you know, move or transfer balances.
00:33:12.694 - 00:33:34.434, Speaker A: Somebody would have wrapped him with a token. Somebody would have taken. I think the beauty of it is that like software, you know, flattens all roads, right? Like as soon as you give an opportunity, it's doable. And it's absurd how slow traditional fintech has been moving to making that possible. It's mind boggling.
00:33:35.564 - 00:34:45.035, Speaker C: Well, I mean, it's because like, you know, traditional finance and traditional fintech, like, operates with extremely narrow innovations. Right where you're taking one thing, you are partnering with all of the different existing incumbents that you have to partner with to get permission to use their systems, and you're making one very small and narrow iterative innovation on top of all of the other incumbents that exist. And you're often partnering with all of them and getting their permission to make a very small iterative improvement. And, you know, the thing that I find like, so massively powerful about everything happening in space right now is, one, don't need permission, and two, the innovations are not small and iterative. And that's why you're seeing this, like, exponential lift off in terms of what's happening in DeFi is because you don't need permission. And permission takes a long time, so you can get to market in like days, not years. And the improvements aren't tiny incremental efficiency gates, they're reinventions across the board.
00:34:45.035 - 00:35:24.184, Speaker C: And so the pace of progress in DeFi is just clearly exponential. And the pace of progress in fintech is extremely linear and very, like, lightly sloped and like that is a powerful magnet, one, to draw more adoption into the space, but two, to completely disrupt existing financial systems and incumbents. And I think, you know, the inflection point is already happening. Like the first two years of DeFi, everyone's like, this is so slow. It looks like this, and now everyone's like, this is crazy. It looks like this, you know, like, chart, but it's an exponential system as opposed to a linear.
00:35:25.484 - 00:35:45.092, Speaker A: Are you ever, like, lose sleep over the idea that there's a lot of the recursive valuations of moving one token to another one and then stacking these smart contracts, a single bug could kind of bring the whole thing down.
00:35:45.228 - 00:36:38.212, Speaker C: Absolutely, absolutely. So, I mean, this is like an important concept that, like, very few users in this space talk about or understand, and there's far less attention paid to it than there was even in like the year ago DeFi or two years ago Defi. You know, there's this concept of like, low level financial primitives and high level financial products. Okay, compound is like a low level financial, really, like, once you get past the technical risks and at this point, with everything that's been done, ideally the technical risks are understood to be extremely low. They're still non zero. Okay? At compound, they're still non zero, but they're extremely low as proven out with a shitload of audits as well as the effect. But right now, you can say the risk of a law in compound is very strong, still non zero.
00:36:38.212 - 00:37:06.216, Speaker C: Just like the risk of a flaw in bitcoin is non zero. Very, very, very low in nonzero. It's a low level system. It doesn't rely on, really any other financial products or systems. You know, if something else goes down, likely compounds completely unaffected. It's very low level system. But then you have products on top that compose compound and another system when you do, you actually have an exponential increase in the risk.
00:37:06.216 - 00:37:32.966, Speaker C: If you have a financial product that combines compound and a trading tool and it's a new system, you have probably three times the technical risk right away. And you have three times the sort of, like, market risk right away. Your risk in, like, one level higher is probably, like nine times. Okay, I'm just gonna estimate back of the.
00:37:33.110 - 00:37:34.194, Speaker A: That's accurate.
00:37:35.014 - 00:37:46.798, Speaker C: It's nine times riskier. You're nine times more likely to lose your money by building a system that composes compound and something else into a new clock. Right. We can even say it's an order of magnitude higher risk.
00:37:46.846 - 00:37:47.454, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:47.614 - 00:38:15.090, Speaker C: Right. You then have systems that compose these other systems. It's probably an order of magnitude and orbit every hop. Higher you go, you have ten times the risk. And in existing financial markets, people are very good at asking the questions about what are all of the risks packaged into this. People are extremely aware of all of the risks, and they map them out. What are all the things that can go wrong all the way down the stack in deep.
00:38:15.090 - 00:38:46.980, Speaker C: Right. Today, people are extremely bad at that. And it's one, because there's not that many people that have seen a whole generation cycle of screw ups, right? And two, like, people, like, aren't trained yet to care about those risks and those problems because they haven't burned people enough times. But, like, in existing financial markets, you know, all the return goes to the people who analyze risks the most carefully. Yeah. And that's not happening. So people don't understand the difference between.
00:38:46.980 - 00:39:58.026, Speaker C: Between, like, you know, a low level system, like, compound, and, like, a system that's so high level that it composes, like, 15 other protocols and systems. And you're like, yeah, why would I want 4% of compound when I can get 6% in this thing up here? And you're like, oh, my goodness. Buyer galore, man. People are getting burnt, right? Like, you know, a few days ago, there was a system called harvest over on the Ethereum blockchain was like, harvest is so high level in the stack that it's like, God, they composed a lot of different risks like, users didn't care. I get 20% in harvest versus 4% down here, and it's like you're taking 100,000 times the risk, and you saw a blow. You know, this is going to happen until people as a ecosystem get trained to start asking this question, looking at it a certain way, eventually, I think the market will sort of, like either sort of, like, self regulate. When I use that term, self regulate, I don't mean like, with, like, trade associations and things like that.
00:39:58.026 - 00:40:13.250, Speaker C: I mean, like, the industry will start to, like, you know, police itself and ask the same questions and be like, what? Where does that return come from? Like, what are the crazy, like, joshuas that could exist and make the risks that could exist to get there? And I think.
00:40:13.282 - 00:40:19.018, Speaker A: Have you ever, have you ever talked to Tarun? I mean, that's his day job, is modeling this stuff.
00:40:19.146 - 00:40:25.010, Speaker C: I talk to Tarun every day. So me and Tarun, we have a small investment fund together, so we actually.
00:40:25.162 - 00:40:26.706, Speaker A: Oh, right, yeah.
00:40:26.850 - 00:40:53.944, Speaker C: Investment projects in the space together. So we spend a lot of time asking all of the questions like, what can go wrong? What don't users see yet? What doesn't see? And, like, are they building a financial product or market that, like, actually makes sense to, like, deliver, you know, value to people for a long time coming? And, like, a lot of the things in the space right now, people just don't know yet are deeply flawed.
00:40:55.044 - 00:41:31.778, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, like, we're gonna have basically, like, people running Monte Carlo simulations on these giant state machines and, like, trying to see what were the risk factors. And I think the world that we build will end up being much better and more responsive because of this, like, idea that everything's a token, you immediately start adjusting the risk on the market. If these markets are open and permissionless and these systems are, like, analyzable by engineers, it'll be a better world. Like, I 100% believe that.
00:41:31.906 - 00:42:11.224, Speaker C: Absolutely. Like, my. My personal hypothesis is that, you know, over time, more and more of the systems are gonna, whether you call it AI or machine learning, whatever. There's gonna be, like, machine operated oversight and management and calibration of all financial problems. And the glorious thing about building on a blockchain is that you're making an open system that can be fully machine operated. Existing finances run fundamentally with spreadsheets and contracts. That's extremely hard to machine operate something that spreadsheets and contracts.
00:42:11.224 - 00:42:24.194, Speaker C: It's going to be inefficient. It's extremely easy to machine operate something that's like a computer program deployed on the blockchain, like, that's like as ideal as it was.
00:42:25.214 - 00:42:54.724, Speaker A: So I had this, like, you know, in the super early days, you know, I was like, brimming with vision and I, you know, like, I kind of saw these systems as like, the only place where true general purpose AI could form is inside one of these chains. And, you know, us as like, running the validators of doing and trading and, like, getting tokens in return. You know, we're ants. We're not aware of the. Of the anthill. Right? Of the intelligence of the anthill.
00:42:55.384 - 00:43:11.300, Speaker C: Crazy. Like, yeah, like, we might be building a system, an infrastructure that's just more fundamentally ideal for more rapid evolution and iteration later where like, the operators of these financial markets are just going to be robots.
00:43:11.472 - 00:43:23.624, Speaker A: Yep. I guess. Let's ask. Let's look through some questions. There's some interesting ones popping up. I've asked one already. There's another one from Ben.
00:43:23.624 - 00:43:40.124, Speaker A: Do you think about the future of compound from a base layer chain approach? Like, are you thinking Ethereum, or are you thinking it's probably going to be Pareto efficient chains? Picking a certain use case probably be compound will work on multiple of them.
00:43:40.544 - 00:44:25.638, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think if compound works on ethereum, which for the record is expensive and somewhat slow, it can work anywhere, and I think it works better than like a trading system. So on a trading system, slow is like a disaster. You don't want something that takes 45 seconds, right? But for like, borrowing, you know, you probably don't care if it takes you 45 seconds to borrow an asset or 545 seconds to begin earning interest. So compound itself is one of the few applications I think has an extremely natural fit with ethereum. I think it works phenomenally on it, and therefore there's less of a need for another chain to be like the logic layer for this system. But another change should absolutely be the logic layer.
00:44:25.638 - 00:44:29.474, Speaker C: If it's like, we need to have fast trading, that's extremely.
00:44:31.474 - 00:44:49.522, Speaker A: So. Like, from my perspective, I kind of see like, all smart contract platforms as fungible block space. It's just like some memory that people agree on. And it doesn't really matter if compound is providing lending services on Ethereum, because you can move those tokens through a bridge to Solana and then trade them.
00:44:49.538 - 00:44:50.618, Speaker C: And then move them back.
00:44:50.786 - 00:44:52.014, Speaker A: Nobody cares.
00:44:54.154 - 00:45:52.054, Speaker C: I think works great on code bridges between Ethereum and Solana, then you kind of actually prefer that the base settlement is on the chain. That's like, yeah, we know it's extremely expensive and slow, and we know that it focuses on having a huge amount of block certainty and finale, it's actually okay to port assets back and forth and run them in compost. So I think it's going to naturally evolve as other chains sort of pop up. There's going to be more and more bridges between Ethereum and other chains, and I think it's going to naturally start to extend versus building something for the first time on a new blockchain. I don't think you have the same value. I see this web evolving between Ethereum and Solana and other blockchains and compounds following the trail of those wormholes and that web between.
00:45:52.514 - 00:46:37.822, Speaker A: So I think what else is, what to me is also, like, somebody that's always thinking about optimizations is that these protocols provide almost like they can smooth away any kind of like, technical complexity of dealing with the underlying consensus. If you have something that needs to wait for 90 seconds on Ethereum and so Solana, you don't actually have to wait. That if I can issue a token and I can borrow from a pool and compound it can settle and repay my debt as soon as this bridge completes. Right. But I can actually go start trading instantly. So then the interest I'm paying is this like 92nd, like, settlement time on, like, actually moving this thing over. And to me, that, like, this stuff is complicated.
00:46:37.822 - 00:46:58.310, Speaker A: It's going to compound the technical risk. But I think, like, like, software flattens all roads. And to me, like, I think there's a ton of opportunity to give people both a really super fast path and a really secure path where we're kind of reducing the real risks. Right. Like collusion risk or intrusion risk and those kinds of things.
00:46:58.462 - 00:47:21.962, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I mean, without a doubt. And I think it's gonna be really interesting to watch sort of how involved. I mean, again, like, you know, I think it comes down to, like, what is the natural use case being created with compound? You know, it's really like a fire and forget product. You're like, I'm going to supply an asset to compound for three months. Like, I'm not going back for another three months. Yeah, right.
00:47:21.962 - 00:47:36.756, Speaker C: And if you're going to be, like, using it for three months, like, proactively, it doesn't matter whether you start at 12:00 p.m. Or 12:01 p.m.. Right. If your horizon for the position is three months. Right. Or if you're borrowing for three weeks. Right.
00:47:36.756 - 00:47:53.464, Speaker C: But other systems where it's like market prices changing, if there's a trade that has to occur, the difference between 12:00 and 1201 for like, trading an asset is like night and day. And so I think it really comes down to like, the innate nature of the product.
00:47:54.044 - 00:48:12.344, Speaker A: So do you guys, are you thinking of like a hybrid approaches where you have like, cause the collateral and the borrowing is tied to some price, it's tied to some price feed? Like there is effectively a risk engine that kind of liquidates.
00:48:13.004 - 00:48:54.454, Speaker C: There is so. And the risk engine allows the community to liquidate. So we basically create like a capitalist free market and like incentivize different actors to come in and just shop risk, which has always been super effective. And we love there is. And the reason though why this system works the way we've designed it is because we assume that it might take minutes or even an hour if something goes horribly wrong. For a price to be updated, the system relies on significant excess collateralization. You say, all right, well, you have to have an extra 20% value because how long does it take for someone to liquidate you? It might take the amount of time it takes for an asset to drop 20%.
00:48:54.454 - 00:49:16.966, Speaker C: Could be an hour, could be a day. Right. And so it relies on the assumption that things aren't instant. If you have this instant, you know, assumption, instead of requiring an extra 20%, you might require an extra like 10%, but you would still have like, you know, a conservatism and how you allow people to interact with the problem. Cool.
00:49:17.150 - 00:49:38.114, Speaker A: And this is where I think, like, it would be interesting to see if it's possible to design the risk engine running on a faster portion and the settlement occurring on back compound. I think that's totally doable. In effect, bridges provide not just token transfers, but RPC's. Hey, did this thing happen remotely?
00:49:38.274 - 00:49:39.014, Speaker C: Yep.
00:49:41.114 - 00:49:49.514, Speaker A: Cool. I guess. Do you see any other questions on there that seem interesting to you?
00:49:50.094 - 00:49:51.874, Speaker C: I've not been looking at the questions.
00:49:55.414 - 00:49:58.554, Speaker A: Yeah. What projects or protocols are you most excited about?
00:49:59.574 - 00:50:48.858, Speaker C: That's a great question. I have been spending a lot less time thinking about things that are not compound lately, but the things that are most exciting to me are actually in the AMm space. So right now we're sort of in this like quasi renaissance ideas about how to make efficient automated market makers exist. Whether it's on Ethereum or Solana or anywhere. I think we're entering this like really exciting, sort of like discovery and research phase of like industry, where, you know, for better, for worse, most of the trading on most of the existing exchanges is done by automated market makers. It's just software that is trained to make, to buy and sell at different prices based on different logical conditions. All the market making in the world today is automated.
00:50:48.858 - 00:51:06.984, Speaker C: It's no longer. All market making is automated. We're evolving from these very simple approaches and methodologies of automatically making a market by being like, just throw a ton of capital into a bucket. And there's a formula that.
00:51:09.364 - 00:51:11.660, Speaker A: Ignore the Arb losses, right?
00:51:11.812 - 00:51:47.404, Speaker C: Yeah. There's more intelligent approaches to programmatically be willing to buy and sell an asset. So I'm, like, deeply excited about all the different. By the way, there's, like, hundreds of experiments right now of, like, how do you have a market being made on a blockchain through software? Right. There's, like, so many things that go into that umbrella, but I think that's really probably, for the next couple years, the most interesting corner of the space for innovation to occur. And I think there's going to be a lot of innovation.
00:51:48.304 - 00:52:38.600, Speaker A: I'm really excited about that, too. And I've. I guess this is me, like, being very bullish about Solana, because I think, like, the CRM spot market is the kind of information that is extremely valuable to compute, an imm that can actually get rid of some of the current inefficiencies. The fact that you have Alameda and Jamp creating that bug means that they ran their risk engines and they're giving you this information for free in a now securely atomic box that you can read. This to me, is, I think, the huge advantage of. Of, like, a hybrid, these hybrid states that can be composed against each other. And this isn't like amms versus clubs.
00:52:38.600 - 00:53:26.044, Speaker A: I think this is actually both complimentary, because I think an Amm in the same system allows investors to kind of blindly click next and deposit their value into something that is passive. It's passive income effectively, but they're leveraging this other system that's dynamic and with a very sophisticated risk engine that can take a hedge position on serum and finance. You can't do that from inside the box. But leveraging that, I think, is massively valuable, and it's beneficial for both, because now you have more depth, the market now is deeper, and that's good for everybody. To me, this is, like, the coolest thing. Like, composing both of these worlds together is now possible.
00:53:26.824 - 00:53:27.924, Speaker C: Gonna be awesome.
00:53:29.024 - 00:53:39.924, Speaker A: Cool. On that note, I think we're at our, like, four minutes, five minutes out. I don't know if there's anything else you want to, like. Is there anything upcoming that you want to share about compound?
00:53:41.144 - 00:54:11.830, Speaker C: Yeah, so I don't leak Alpha, so nothing to share but, you know, I will say I'm always excited by things happening in this space. I try to be, you know, open to chat with pretty much any founder, any team. If you're working on something super cool, just hit me up on Twitter, hit me up on Telegram, you know, would love to just sort of, like, learn about what you're building and see if I can be helpful as somebody, you know, active in this place. So don't ever hesitate to reach out. I'm always going to be a sounding board for new ideas.
00:54:11.982 - 00:54:21.874, Speaker A: That's. I would honestly, if you're listening, take that. Taken Robert up on that because him and Tarun are probably one of the smartest people I've met.
