00:00:04.160 - 00:00:11.118, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, GMGM. I'm Nick from the Solana Foundation Devrel team. And welcome to the changelog. Jonas, how are you doing this week?
00:00:11.286 - 00:00:14.854, Speaker B: Hey, I'm doing great. I'm very excited about the hackathon that's going on.
00:00:15.014 - 00:00:45.992, Speaker A: Oh, I'm so excited about the hackathon. We got hyperdrive hackathons in full force, started a couple of weeks ago. You know, you've got this, this awesome page, this phenomenal graphic. I love staring at it for a while. All the details you can find on Solana.com hyperdrive. If you're looking to participate in the hackathon, including all the prizes that are available and developer resources, the Devrel team is also hosting office hours in the Solana hackathon discord at Discord GG Hyperdrive.
00:00:45.992 - 00:01:16.360, Speaker A: So please stop on in. We've got office hours twice a week, again, hosted by the Devrel team at Solana foundation. And then, you know, if you're looking for any other events that are going on in the ecosystem, check out the community events page@solana.com. Events it's loaded with not only events that are being put on by the Solana foundation, but there's an open calendar for anyone in the community to submit any events that they're doing to this shared calendar. So please do check it out and submit your events if you know that there's one going on in the ecosystem.
00:01:16.552 - 00:01:50.176, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. There's so many cool events in here now, which I didn't know that happened. And now you can just find them all in this nice, convenient list and just join them. And also, if you're still searching for ideas, there is build superteam fun, and there's a big list of projects that you could build also from different companies. And yeah, just nice ideas. If you're still searching for something, it's a very good inspiration. And if it's one of the tracks who also sponsor prizes, then maybe it's also a good idea to build on their ideas.
00:01:50.176 - 00:02:32.992, Speaker C: Actually, first we want to talk about this request for products, which is a big opportunity. If you want to build something, there's a request for product, which means that there's a grant that you could potentially get by implementing this feature here or this program. And it's about security tokens and real world asset program. And you can find it in the Solana forum. And I recommend you also read through the SRFC twelve because there's a bunch of information on it here, and you should join in discussions if you're planning on building this. There's also this big graph here. So what it basically is, it's building on top of SPL tokens, and it's.
00:02:32.992 - 00:02:41.084, Speaker C: Maybe you can help me a bit there, Nick, but I think it's tokenizing certain real world assets, like real estate, for example, right?
00:02:41.424 - 00:03:36.484, Speaker A: Yeah, basically, from my understanding, it's this proposal. This request is basically to get someone to, someone from the ecosystem helped build this unified program on Solana itself to help bring real world assets to the chain. And effectively, you can think of it like a wrapper on top of SPL program that adds a bunch of functionality and checks, including ways to link off chain assets and off chain data like real estate, to on chain tokens, like an NFT, something that's non fungible, and giving some various controls about transfers of ownership and things like that. And. Yeah, Jonas, like you said, if anyone is interested in maybe participating in this and wants to apply for this grant, you can find the details on the SRF three page. And please do apply for the grant. Like applications close at the end of September, and we really look forward to seeing all the applications that come through.
00:03:36.904 - 00:03:48.714, Speaker C: Yeah, sounds like a really interesting project. Also includes KYC, for example. But let's look at some of the commits. Maybe. I think you picked a few interesting ones this time.
00:03:49.054 - 00:04:34.222, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. There's two good commits that I saw. The first one is adding a new syscall data point. So you can actually get, you could request within your program, within your rust code, you can actually request the compute units that your program has already consumed. For the longest time, you've actually been able to change how many compute units you're, your program is actually consuming. You can request a higher balance, but now you can actually programmatically determine how many compute units you have consumed, and you can take action accordingly within your program. So I think that'll be a really nice little ergonomic feature that will allow programs that do more complex things to actually determine if they need higher compute unit and handle different actions based off how many compute units they have actually consumed.
00:04:34.222 - 00:05:02.934, Speaker A: And the other commit that I thought was interesting is it's all around ZK. It's basically just a simple refactor to the ZK token proof program, making it so the actual compute units that are consumed by the ZK program are exposed. That way you can actually figure out the exact number of compute units consumed, and it's just a small little refactor, but it's ZK is the hot topic these days. Privacy on chain. It's all the rage.
00:05:03.714 - 00:05:41.292, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I'm very excited about privacy as well. And Helios, which is an RPC provider on Solana, wrote this very nice article about how you can have privacy on Solana, actually, and it's especially highlighting two protocols. It's elusive. It's a company from Germany which provides you the possibility to do private transfers. And then there's light protocol, which works on ZK proofs on chain, and very well, verifiable functions and so on. And yeah, I would totally recommend you to check this out, read through this.
00:05:41.292 - 00:05:52.324, Speaker B: It's very interesting. It comes also with some full code examples for elusive and light protocol. And yeah, it's very interesting. Check it out.
00:05:52.484 - 00:05:55.104, Speaker C: The next thing is that the Lampard Dao ended, right?
00:05:55.404 - 00:05:58.544, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, not the Lampport Dao, but the hackathon.
00:05:59.084 - 00:06:06.044, Speaker C: Not the Lamport dao, but the hackathon organized by Lampard Dowling called Opos Hackathon.
00:06:06.204 - 00:06:34.624, Speaker A: Yeah, the oposs hackathon winners were officially announced. You can see them here in this thread by the Lamport Dao discord's Twitter account. And there's over 65 winners, give or take, that have actually been able to claim prizes during the hackathon because of all the various tracks that were, that existed. So it's really great to see if you build something for the Opus hackathon. Like, congratulations. Thanks for participating. And don't forget to check out all the other projects on cubic and see what everyone that won.
00:06:34.964 - 00:06:45.484, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a big fun to just like scroll through the submissions and have a look at them. There's also many games in there. It's like, it's crazy how many, how many things people build. Yeah.
00:06:45.524 - 00:06:58.620, Speaker A: Especially in such a short time period, in just under a month. Like, so, so many cool things were built. Look forward to seeing what everyone builds for the hyperdrive hackathon, too. It's going to be great. All right, I guess let's go ahead and wrap up this week's changelog. Thanks for joining, everybody, and we'll see you next week.
00:06:58.772 - 00:06:59.996, Speaker C: See you next week, everybody. Bye.
