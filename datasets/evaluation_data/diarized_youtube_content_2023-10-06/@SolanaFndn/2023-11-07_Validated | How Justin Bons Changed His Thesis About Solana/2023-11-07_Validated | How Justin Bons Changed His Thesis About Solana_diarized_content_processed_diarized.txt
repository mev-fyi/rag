00:00:04.920 - 00:00:07.118, Speaker A: Justin Bonds, welcome to Validated.
00:00:07.286 - 00:00:12.838, Speaker B: Thank you. It's really wonderful for you to invite me here today, and I'm excited to speak to you.
00:00:12.926 - 00:00:16.834, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, this is an episode I wasn't sure we'd ever do.
00:00:17.534 - 00:00:41.184, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a bit of a surprise to me as well. But I think it's important that we're able to change our mind over time. So I think I might as well just call out the elephant in the room while we're here. Historically, I've been a very large Solana critic, and I think over the last few months, let's say I've really warmed up to Solana in a number of different ways.
00:00:41.684 - 00:01:20.322, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to talk about that. But I also think you do a few things that are pretty rare for someone in this space to do. The first is you change your mind. The second is that you articulate and take positions that I think most people who are on the capital side don't do. If you look at most of the theses coming out of large VC's or even like actively traded funds, they're very broad. They seem to never want to put their bet on a specific technology. They always want to talk about a category of technology or talk about a type of application that could potentially take off.
00:01:20.322 - 00:01:42.464, Speaker A: Even when they're making really strong statements, you very rarely see them saying, this company is going to succeed, this protocol is going to succeed, this protocol is not going to succeed. So I kind of want to start a little bit with your background and how you sort of decided that that sort of sharp articulation of a specific thesis was something you wanted to be sort of putting out there in public.
00:01:42.764 - 00:02:10.452, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you for pointing that out. And now I would love to talk about that in more detail. And I think part of the reason why is I'm not in an average investor in cryptocurrency. I think you see a lot of VC's out there. You see a lot of traders, you see a lot of quantitative approaches. But I'm very much taking a value investing, long term value investing approach into cryptocurrency.
00:02:10.452 - 00:03:30.910, Speaker B: As part of that is I'm really a blockchain researcher first, really looking at the fundamentals and trying to understand the fundamentals. And as part of that, really think about some of the big questions in the cryptocurrency space. And I think if you're doing long term value investing in cryptocurrency, like my firm is doing cyber capital, then I think a lot of thinking about cryptocurrency revolves around some of these big questions like do we scale with monolithic or a modular approach? Do we do on chain governance or do we do off chain governance? Is it proof of work or should we do proof of stake? Should we have deterministic or non deterministic block production, et cetera, et cetera. And I think there's these really big questions and I think if you're able to answer these questions, then I think things become more self evident down the road. And I think that's where you could say I take a very different approach to most other investors in the space. And I think that's also what leads me down a contrarian road as well. And that's something I've chosen to be very public about as well and calling out things that I disagree with a lot of the time and going out of my way to critique things when I see problems with things and taking a strong position.
00:03:30.910 - 00:03:57.264, Speaker B: And sometimes I'm going to go against the grain or I'm going to go against what the majority think. And I think that's not an approach that most vc's in this space take. They tend to go with the majority, they tend to follow the waves, whereas I think there is more opportunity, at least for me as a long term value investor, there's more opportunity in seeking areas where the majority of people might be wrong.
00:03:57.644 - 00:04:25.754, Speaker A: Yeah, so I want to dig into that a little more because I think when people say they're a long term investor in crypto, sometimes they mean nine to twelve months for you. What is that sort of perspective of your long term vision? How many years or what time duration are you normally looking at and thinking about? And how do you sort of go about identifying and codifying what those values are that you think will produce returns over that time horizon?
00:04:25.834 - 00:05:15.942, Speaker B: Oh wow, that's a great question. There's actually a lot to unpack there, obviously. So first of all, I think there's two questions. I think the first question would be how long is your time arise? And the second question is how do you evaluate what is value, what is good fundamentals in this space? So ill start with time horizon specifically to cyber capital and its mandated, its investment philosophy and strategy. I think when we invest in a cryptocurrency, we invest with the mentality that we could still be holding this cryptocurrency in a century from now. So really thinking long term on terms of civilizational timescales. I mean the reality though is that we might buy an asset with the intention of the long term.
00:05:15.942 - 00:06:12.170, Speaker B: But the reality is that cryptocurrency keeps changing, the competition keeps changing, the technology keeps evolving, and our understanding of the fundamentals keep changing as well. So based upon those changing fundamentals, we keep switching around positions, and quite dramatically, even really, cyber capital is now the oldest cryptocurrency fund in Europe. I founded it in 2016, and in 2017, we were very public about not holding any BTC at all in the fund, being critical towards BTC in this case. And that was a lot more controversial back then than it is today. And I think as part of that, we really try to switch the position. For instance, one month, there might not be a lot of movement at all. Another month, like 10% of the portfolio might have changed.
00:06:12.322 - 00:06:37.092, Speaker A: It's funny because you look at something like 100 year time horizon, and there's just so many assumptions. I mean, even on a ten year time horizon, the number of assumptions you have to make that goes into being confident over even ten years is high. So I'm curious, because, again, most folks in the space are not thinking about that long. Most folks, even in the equities investment space, are not in that sort of time horizon.
00:06:37.188 - 00:06:53.580, Speaker B: I should also clarify something here. I think when we, as from a researcher's perspective, we have that mentality is like, could this still be something that exists in 100 years from now? But I think from an investor's perspective, I should say, because we don't expect investors to wait 100 years to see a return.
00:06:53.732 - 00:06:54.932, Speaker A: That would be one heck of an ARR.
00:06:54.988 - 00:07:00.192, Speaker B: More like a three to five year horizon is what we recommend to our investors as a minimum.
00:07:00.388 - 00:07:41.324, Speaker A: Got it. That's still an amount of time that is hard to predict in this space. This gets into the values that you've identified for cyber capital in terms of what you. And it thinks in terms of what will make something successful within that time horizon. I want to get into that, but then also talk a little bit about that thesis development out of those values, how you actually can say, here's a series of values that we believe in will make something successful over the long term, and here's how we can see where a protocol is today and how we extrapolate that out five years into the future.
00:07:41.984 - 00:08:37.992, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. And you also touched on something interesting. I mean, this company's been running for close to seven years now. I've been a researcher in this space for a decade now as well. And I think, but at least when you're working with a team of researchers and you're working in this kind of organized way, and you're building up investment principles over time, and you're building up a research database and you're developing all of these lessons, and then you're developing your theories and your principles, then there is a lot of built up knowledge, so to speak, and experience that you can draw on. So a lot of the time, we might see a particular idea might come across our desk and we're like, oh, well, we already saw this in 2018, and that didn't work out very well. Or like, oh, well, we've explored a lot of the ideas that people think, and you potentially have already been tied in the past as well.
00:08:37.992 - 00:08:53.884, Speaker B: And I think, I think people underestimate the breadth of experience I think that we have in cryptocurrency as a whole already. And in terms of that, history, and always frustrates me when history repeats. But I suppose that's part of the tragedy of humanity as well on so many levels.
00:08:54.994 - 00:09:33.608, Speaker A: I'm curious on that because in some ways, yes, absolutely. I think in the last bull market run up, you saw a lot of people who were around in 2018 sort of saying is he really should take some profits because this isn't. And then there are other people who are like, yes, we're up 12,000% on our meme token in the last twelve months, but don't worry, we're going to 24,000%. And you saw that dichotomy really strongly. But I think one of the pieces that was interesting to see is in the sort of like the market we're in now, which is not really a bear market in anything but price. Right. Developer activity is still really high.
00:09:33.608 - 00:10:19.140, Speaker A: User activity is still high. There's ideas now that are buildable and that folks are building and have gotten adoption that couldn't be built a few years ago, or at least couldn't catch on a few years ago. And so I'm kind of curious. This is, I mean, to take a step back for a second. I think the macroscope of what we're talking about today is how you bring new information into an existing thesis and be willing to rewrite that existing thesis. And I would say one component of that is that there's a lot of stuff that didn't work in 2020 into 2021 that is starting to work in 2023. And that if you were talking about sort of, we have this huge breadth of experience from the last ten years, that's completely true.
00:10:19.140 - 00:10:30.476, Speaker A: But I think payments are probably finally at a place where the technology is sufficiently built up enough that it actually works, that USDC is dependable enough you can build a payments product.
00:10:30.540 - 00:11:27.824, Speaker B: Well, in that example, I think it's very important to identify why a particular use case didn't work. So I've been beyond frustrated in terms of cryptocurrency history. So far we've had BTC, which was always intended to scale and pivoted and didn't scale. And I was very vocal part of those block size debates, which at least makes me very consistent till this day in my criticisms towards BTC. And then we had Ethereum, which was for many years committed to scaling on chain with sharding. And really, as of last year, completely pivoted away from scaling on chain and focusing on a L2, quote unquote L2 scalability roadmap. And to me, that was really one of the biggest tragedies for me.
00:11:27.824 - 00:11:55.216, Speaker B: But I think it's part of that. It's very important to identify why. I've never given up on this idea of payments. I've always rejected this idea that 99% of use cases won't work because there's no capacity. I mean, I think just a blockchain that doesn't have capacity is just a bit of a joke to me. It's like, what are we even doing here? What's even the point? And I can understand where I'm coming from. I would like to loop back a little bit as well to your last question about evaluation.
00:11:55.216 - 00:13:06.444, Speaker B: I think we're touching on it now as well, in terms of how do we evaluate a cryptocurrency? Or at least how do we do that? Or how do I do that? I think for me, as a value investor, I've got a very large focus on utility. So I really think that there's an immense value in the utility that blockchains are able to bring to the table. And that value is expressed in different ways. I mean, we have these tokens that are critical in terms of the functioning of the blockchain, and one characteristic that Solana shares with Ethereum, as well as its economic model in terms of having tail inflation combined with fee burning. This is one of the reasons I also actually really like Solana. Now, if I look at it objectively, and there's a few more maybe we can touch on later. For me, in terms of evaluation, I look at things like what is the capacity of the blockchain? What is the governance of a blockchain? What is the consensus algorithm? What is the internal state of the politics? I think it's very important to take a holistic view here.
00:13:06.444 - 00:13:59.004, Speaker B: What security trade offs are possibly being made here. So I think for me, it's taking this holistic view, even multi disciplinary approach, where you might combine things like computer science, economics, political philosophy, among other things, to really understand the bigger picture of a cryptocurrency. Because you can't just look at a cryptocurrency from a one dimensional perspective. You can't just say, oh, it's good or it's bad because of this reason or that reason. Theres a huge scale of different parameters to consider. And I think, at least for me, as an investor and as a believer in cryptocurrency, I think decentralization is of the utmost importance, scalability is of the utmost importance. Thats why im also of the belief that the blockchain tilemo can be solved, or I would even argue it already has been solved, actually.
00:13:59.004 - 00:14:26.164, Speaker B: And I think thats really what has been, you know, defining my journey in so many ways is that I want this empowering freedom, enabling technology to be usable by everyone. That's where it really shines, you know, and that's been part of our focus, both as an investor, but also as a believer in this movement. You know, I found a place where I can happily combine those things.
00:14:26.744 - 00:15:00.884, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to talk a little bit about something you said there, which is organizational politics. I think a lot of times people look at blockchains and they just do a technical audit, they do a network audit, they look at how many on chain transactions there are, and they really don't think about that human side. And I think implicitly, there is an assumption in a lot of people that humans are messy, but it'll sort itself out. What do you view as both good and potentially not good signs when you're evaluating the more messy human side of an organization?
00:15:01.884 - 00:16:12.620, Speaker B: Yeah. So governance is one of my specialities, you could say, in cryptocurrency, and there's a lot to unpack there, really. So I've been a big advocate of on chain governance for many years, but I think maybe it might sense to just wind back a little bit and to understand where I'm coming from. So part of the reason I even started, you know, speaking up and switched from a lurker to a participant, let's say, in cryptocurrency, is because of what happened in BTC, where BTC was pivoting from one side to another. So back in the early days in 2014, I was on Bitcoins Hawk, and I saw all of these, let's say, computer scientists and developers discussing the question of who decides how do we even decide whether to take half a or path b. And that's when I really felt, hey, I can actually contribute to this discussion because that was my background. I have a background in the humanities personally, so political philosophy and history, among other things.
00:16:12.620 - 00:17:39.331, Speaker B: So for me, I was like, okay, well, this is great, because now I can start thinking about, I can start factoring in human nature. And part of the reason why I even believe in cryptocurrency in the first place is that blockchains are uniquely able, through, let's say, cryptographic economic game theory, they're uniquely able to align incentives of human beings. And one of the things that initially really attracted me to cryptocurrency is that I saw a potential, a power for us to actually have new political experiments, new ways for social coordination, a new way to kind of have this kind of single sources of truth, right? That doesn't just rely like, unlike, let's say, a lot of democracies. And I think a lot of the dysfunctions we see in democracies are due to, say, a populist that isn't as participatory or well informed or enlightened or have good ethics, then maybe we would ideally want them to be for the democracy to function in the most optimum way. Cryptocurrency doesn't depend on people's goodwill. It depends upon, like I said, economic incentives. And that's something that I realized, that if we can modify human behavior in such a way through economic incentives, then that is actually, that's unbelievably powerful.
00:17:39.331 - 00:18:43.674, Speaker B: That's actually a type of evolution of, say, the division of powers, if you will, in terms of, or the separation of certain aspects that were once part of the state can now be privatized. I mean, I saw this as being this really big deal in terms of civilizational progress. And I think the challenge, and I think governance, I genuinely believe this. I think governance is probably one of the biggest unsolved problems in cryptocurrency yet. I think part of the challenge, and we're facing dilemmas here, is that what I saw happen in BTC in terms of this, quote, unquote, off chain governance, or what, what they call social consensus, is that effectively you have a centralized group of developers that end up deciding on the course of what a cryptocurrency is going to do. You can get ten people in a room together, I would argue ten to 20 people in both BTC Ethereum and I would say Solano as well. And I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing at its stage, but it's something we need to acknowledge.
00:18:43.674 - 00:19:30.424, Speaker B: You get those people together, you get them all to agree to a particular course of action, and then you come out together with that course of action and that's what's going to happen. That's the real politic behind the scenes. So, I mean, that's why also as an investor, also as a researcher, we're very dependent upon the core team doing the right thing. So I would argue that even if you implemented on chain governance, even if you added proposal voting, this would still happen. I don't actually think decentralized governance even functions unless you're at a much larger scale. And this is kind of the dilemma. It's a chicken before the egg problem, right? But however, if you implement the decentralized governance too late, the system might already be captured to a point where.
00:19:30.424 - 00:20:27.248, Speaker B: To a point where you can't actually implement it. So, for instance, if the system's at a very large scale and you have this balance of power and you have these people kind of all, or say the system's captured and you have someone that's already effectively controlling the system, if you're saying, okay, we are now going to implement decentralized governance, you're basically asking them to give up their power that goes against their human incentives, so to speak. So governance to me is really about considering the corruptibility of human beings, considering that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It's about mitigating those negative effects so that we can have a system that optimizes also for good decision making instead of relying on the leadership. But this thing only functions at a massive scale that we haven't even reached yet. And that's why we're so dependent upon teams initially. So, sorry, that was a bit of a rant.
00:20:27.296 - 00:20:27.816, Speaker A: No, no.
00:20:27.920 - 00:20:29.440, Speaker B: Things for you to maybe comment on there.
00:20:29.472 - 00:20:35.624, Speaker A: So I've been laughing this whole time because like my background is government and political science.
00:20:35.704 - 00:20:37.632, Speaker B: Oh, we have that in common then. Fantastic.
00:20:37.688 - 00:21:49.988, Speaker A: Yes. And all of my kind of undergraduate work and I actually thought about like going and working and on a PhD coming out of school and this was on treaty compliance frameworks and international freshwater management treaties because that's exactly what we're talking about here. It's a finite, scarce resource that no one has a complete monopoly on. But you have to build governance frameworks that two countries that hate each other potentially, or at least two governments that hate each other, like India and Pakistan, have fought several wars but never turned the water off to one another. And that is a massive success of treaty frameworks. There's so much of political science that can come into this blockchain space and really help us make things that are both more compelling and more usable for folks. But at its core, the thing that brought me into this space was the idea that if we get the philosophy of self governance and self custody into more people's minds, as opposed to the idea of government being something that happens to you, as opposed to something that you have influence on, we can fix a lot of the problems in the world today that there's too many folks who just sort of say, well, we'll let the government fix it.
00:21:49.988 - 00:22:00.796, Speaker A: And at some point you have to be the government in order to fix things that are large enough. They require lots of buy in. So it's kind of funny that we have that similar background there.
00:22:00.940 - 00:22:15.794, Speaker B: Yeah, no, certainly. And we're actually part of a rare breed in cryptocurrency. I think usually people have the more technical background. So it's like you can get a, you can get a computer scientist learn political philosophy, or you can get a political philosopher to use computer science.
00:22:17.054 - 00:22:49.354, Speaker A: Yeah, it's so funny because this is the thing I talk about all the time with folks, is that I think the hardest problems for blockchains over the next ten years is not going to be technical, it's going to be social. That the technical side. Right now, it used to be computer science and now it's just software engineering, which is not the little software engineering, but it's just work. Like we fundamentally know what we're trying to do. How we build it matters, but how we build it is like the human side of it building. It's actually just work at this point.
00:22:49.814 - 00:23:52.148, Speaker B: Well, I mean, it depends what you're building towards, right? So part of the reasons I've become more bullish on Solana is actually due to Ethereum's failures to scale on so many ways. And it's like, well, why? Why did it give up on sharding? Why they saying it's not possible? And while other blockchains are scaling, that's the most damning thing to me, for them to say it's not possible to scale and then competitive blockchains are scaling. And that to me, while preserving decentralization, I might add that to me is very damning. That to me is okay. I actually think there is a, and I actually think it's the same thing, this l two scaling narrative. I think it's, to a large part because of a disproportional amount of funding that exists for L2s as opposed to layer one development. So from a developer's perspective, there's a lot more money to be made.
00:23:52.148 - 00:24:38.570, Speaker B: Like, we're talking about billions of dollars in these tokens in VC investments and companies that are being spun off. I mean, be it arbitrum and optimism and these things in Ethereum, or be it blockstream and chain code labs and BTC. I actually think this is a major conflict of interest. And I think if you say, well, developers are totally in charge of this system and it's effectively a type of quasi dictatorship, if you will, which I think is completely undefendable when it comes to know what's supposed to be a decentralized blockchain. I think that's a major perverse incentive. And I've seen this happening twice now, happen in bitcoin, happened in Ethereum. So I'm like, okay, this is a systemic flaw in governance.
00:24:38.570 - 00:25:21.224, Speaker B: And BTC and Ethereum has been very vocal on, they're against on chain governance. They're all for off chain governance. So what does off chain governance mean? They're like, what does that mean? Who actually gets to decide in an off chain governance system? Okay, I'll tell you, it's basically old school politics, but without any of the checks and balances, without any transparency, without any accountability, it's just lord of the flies. Okay, okay. If you know anything about political philosophy or political science or history, you know that that's a very, very bad idea. That's just throwing the sheep to the wolves.
00:25:21.844 - 00:25:32.024, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny in a weird way. We are talking about regulatory capture here. Yeah, some amount of core contributor.
00:25:32.724 - 00:25:35.264, Speaker B: Was this technically a corporate capture, maybe?
00:25:35.564 - 00:25:55.884, Speaker A: Yeah, something like that. The incentives of the people who are actually now building most of the code has divorced from the interests of the people actually using the network and the original founding ideals of what a network is. Exactly. So here's my question. Do you think any network can actually survive this?
00:25:57.344 - 00:26:55.008, Speaker B: I think blockchains are very good at surviving. So if I were just a nitpick a little bit, I would say, sure, there's a big difference between surviving, thriving, or even keeping dominance. So, no, I think ultimately no blockchain will thrive or keep any sort of dominance if the system becomes captured like this, especially in a very perverse way that effectively cripples the blockchain. I'd like to point that out because I'm very unconvinced that a quote unquote layer to scaling ecosystem is able to provide a good enough ux and for that reason, I would say that that's why I think that if Ethereum continues on its current path, I'm convinced we'll lose its dominance. And BTC is clearly way overdue for losing its number one position in this market. It's becoming a bit embarrassing at this point, frankly speaking, but we'll get there.
00:26:55.056 - 00:27:23.434, Speaker A: Yeah. It's funny, because back in 2020, I was working at Bison trails, and one of our major initiatives there was building ETH, two staking infrastructure, and that included a whole educational component of it, too. Yeah, I remember sitting down and going through this stuff. This is when we were still talking about sharding, right? There was supposed to be 56 shards that were going to launch based on the beacon chain, and then from there would scale up to hundreds, if not thousands of shards someday.
00:27:24.454 - 00:27:32.606, Speaker B: I love that. Yeah, well, that's what I signed up for. I'm, like, on chain scaling. Yeah, I'm a BTC refugee. This is great. Then you promised, right?
00:27:32.630 - 00:27:43.250, Speaker A: And then there were going to be data availability shards, and then that fell off. The execution fell off, and then the data shards actually fell off as well. And I guess I'm kind of curious from.
00:27:43.322 - 00:27:49.594, Speaker B: Well, from the perspective, is a form of data sharding, data availability sharding, technically, yeah, that's true.
00:27:49.634 - 00:27:54.722, Speaker A: But it still seems very limited in terms of how much data we're actually adding, at least to me.
00:27:54.818 - 00:28:28.480, Speaker B: And it's very unbelievably reminiscent. Again, I'm going to keep repeating this theme of history repeating itself. But what they're doing with data availability, sorry, data availability sharding, is they're doing something that pretty much only benefits L2 s. They're creating this kind of separate field where now L2s can put their data in cheaper. Right. But this siding does not cover execution. So no layer one transactions, no layer one smart contract logic or anything like that.
00:28:28.480 - 00:29:07.624, Speaker B: No, it's just data availability for. And the thing is, the amount of gas that the L2s are spending is around 1% of the total net network. Right? So all that they're doing is they're not relieving the network as a whole. They're just giving the L2s this kind of advantage, saying, oh, well, now you have this separate field where you can put the data in that you need. Right. Reminds me a lot of SiGwit, by the way, I'm not sure how familiar you are with this history, but in SiGwit, they created a separate field which literally had an arbitrary 50% discount, which would specifically benefit the lightning network. Right.
00:29:07.624 - 00:29:56.916, Speaker B: And they did this instead of just increasing the block size limit. So, I mean, this just strikes me as being kind of exactly the same thing. So, you know, Ethereum is not scaling at all, basically that, that 1% of relief is pretty much negligible at this point. And I might add the amount of fees that L2s are collecting. So, as you know, for a while there, Ethereum was deflationary because of the fee burning, which is great. And I think for the last month or two months, if I know quickly, it has not been deflationary, it's actually been increasing in its total supply. Well, if Ethereum had simply scaled, and let's say all of the transaction in the L2s were now on the layer one, ethereum would be a deflationary again, and only 1% of the total gas fees are actually going back to Ethereum.
00:29:56.916 - 00:30:16.424, Speaker B: These L2s are quasi parasitical on the chain at this point. Don't get me wrong, I don't think all L2s are bad. I think there's use cases where L2s make sense, but restricting the layer one in favor of L2s, that's a travesty in my opinion.
00:30:17.404 - 00:31:11.392, Speaker A: Yeah. And I've always found it interesting that the folks who are true believers in l two s, and, you know, like, say what you will about like the folks who are true believers, but like, there are some very smart, technical people who really believe in the l two architecture, they will tell you that l two s are ethereum, that this is the natural scaling future of Ethereum. And the piece that's always been interesting for me is, well, then why? Why are more people not comfortable transacting on them? And that's always been, that sort of lock for me is like if you were creating a true l two architecture that felt the same to folks emotionally as transacting on Ethereum, that would be a different effect. But the fact that people are even still bothering to transact on Ethereum today means the l two vision, at least in my view, is still nowhere near fruition, whether you believe in it or not. We don't have the l two implementation today that we were promised by the l two folks.
00:31:11.448 - 00:32:03.122, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think it's actually unsolvable, and I'll get into that a little bit. It's. So I think a true scaling solution should be part of a coherent whole, so to speak, so that from a user's perspective, you don't need to know about L2s or shards, or paralyzation, or separate mempools in the case of Solana. And I think that L2s fundamentally cant solve that because what theyre essentially doing is theyre saying, okay, were going to let the free market, instead of l one developers doing l one development, theyre going to say, no, the free market is going to solve this for us. The free market is great. I love the free market, im a capitalist, but not all things should be solved by the free market.
00:32:03.122 - 00:32:57.996, Speaker B: I think something that Ethereum did right was unleashing smart contract. Just make a touring complete and specific dapps can be built out. Unleash that to the free market. I thought that was a great idea. That's, I think one of the main reasons Ethereum was successful and bitcoin not scaling. And I think that in the case of attempting to solve it that way, what you end up with is massive fragmentation. So then you'll have hundreds of solutions, right? And some of those solutions are going to have admin keys, and some of those solutions are going to be custodian, and some of those solutions are going to have centralized sequences, okay? And in order for a user to have to navigate that now is just way too much to ask, right, because it requires so much more user choice like these ethereum l two folks will say, oh no, no, we'll solve the UX options, we'll just abstract it all away.
00:32:57.996 - 00:33:56.050, Speaker B: No, but you can't, because if you abstract it away, you take away user choice to a point that it would be wrong. Right? Let's say we have an ecosystem of 100 l two s. You can't make it seamlessly interoperable because you can't say, have a purely decentralized, proper cypherpunk l two seamlessly interoperate without any user input, with a chain that maybe has admin keys or has to go through a trusted bridge. All of these things present extra risks and a user needs to be informed of those risks. So to me, I don't see how this kind of quote unquote free market of, of L2 s whatever, solve the problem. If you enshrined the L2 s, or did like based l two s, where the l one validators actually confirm, you know, are actually responsible for those roll ups, then you could have an ecosystem of enshrined roll ups where it would be perfectly seamless and interoperable. I'm actually open to that potential solution for scaling, but that's not what Ethereum is doing.
00:33:56.050 - 00:34:45.474, Speaker B: And I think even if it decides to do that in the future, the power of these L2s, the, you know, the amount of income they're making, it's going to be too entrenched. It's going to be too much to politically overcome. You know, I mean, I mean, in theory, we can change the code of any blockchain, right? We can fork any ledger. But what we need to evaluate is what's the probability of change in this directions? What are the incentives one way, and what are the incentives the other way? This is part of, like, how to do a real political analysis, right, to actually predict what decisions are going to be made. And I think, I don't see how Ethereum is going to get out of this one. I mean, I'm trying to best to shout off the rooftops, hey, this is a terrible idea, but I'm really struggling to see how this can be solved without just voting with our feet.
00:34:46.654 - 00:35:13.378, Speaker A: Yeah, it's so funny, this whole conversation. I'm laughing this whole time because there's so few people who are really thinking about this stuff this way. And this is like, like, I remember when Greenpeace came out with that whole change the code campaign for bitcoin, right? What, what, whatever you think about the change, there are so many folks who are like, it's bitcoin. You can't change the code. I'm like, of course you can change the code. It's all social consensus. There's no bitcoin corporation that's stamping a, you know, this is bitcoin.
00:35:13.378 - 00:35:19.994, Speaker A: This is not like if everyone running nodes decides like, hey, we're going to change something. Like, it's changed. That's it.
00:35:20.034 - 00:35:33.236, Speaker B: That's how it goes. I think bitcoin core needs to give it a stamp of approval or no change will happen. I mean, that's part of my critique of BTC is that effectively you have a single party that can act as gatekeeper to all decision making.
00:35:33.420 - 00:35:36.100, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, and hold on, hold on.
00:35:36.132 - 00:35:47.180, Speaker B: The majority of nodes decide on governance. I mean, that is such a ridiculous idea. No, no, I mean, it's like, I mean, proof of work was invented as a civil prevention mechanism, right?
00:35:47.212 - 00:35:47.492, Speaker A: Yes.
00:35:47.548 - 00:35:56.144, Speaker B: It literally says in the white paper by Satoshi, you can't base consensus on one ip. One vote doesn't work.
00:35:56.484 - 00:35:57.584, Speaker A: It doesn't work.
00:35:57.884 - 00:36:22.144, Speaker B: This is just, you can spin up thousands of notes trivially. So this idea of like, oh, no, it's like, this is it. This fantasy of like, no, this is this perfect meritocracy, this perfect egalitarian utopia where the best ideas always win and we're all open minded and we all sing Kumbaya and bitcoin just represents perfect decentralization. It's a delusion. That's not how things work.
00:36:22.484 - 00:36:46.692, Speaker A: Yeah, completely. And this reminds me of the other Ronin bridge hack, where there is that guy that shorted Axie when he noticed all the ETH was gone, and no one believed him for four days until they bothered to check. And that's just like, these markets are perfect information. They have all the information. It's literally all unchained, and we still couldn't even be bothered to look and see if the ETH was still in the bridge or not.
00:36:46.828 - 00:36:47.164, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:47.204 - 00:36:59.732, Speaker A: Like, this is the thing that always, like, the paradox of this space for me is that we've never had more open and more perfect information systems, and somehow it seems like we've never been worse informed about what's actually going on on them.
00:36:59.788 - 00:37:03.724, Speaker B: Well, that's. That's where human beings are the floor in the system, right.
00:37:03.804 - 00:37:04.300, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:04.412 - 00:37:34.954, Speaker B: And that's where we need to hammer out better kind of designs of governance to kind of mitigate that and to formulate that, you know? Yeah, it's a wild ride, but I think it's part of that. I'm thankful just to be part of this time period and to be able to put my weight on the scales a little bit in terms of one way or another. I think Solana has, they don't have decentralized governance, but there has been a talk about it, and they're not against it, as far as I understand.
00:37:35.454 - 00:38:06.654, Speaker A: Yeah. So the governance model on Solana right now is basically validator stake weighted upgrades. So the validators effectively vote on upgrades by adopting new software that includes feature activation. So, for example, if we're going to increment something from by .1 to another version, that code for a new version of an on chain program or something like that would be included in the software update package that goes out, I should say, was like a core piece of SPL code.
00:38:06.694 - 00:38:07.174, Speaker B: Wow.
00:38:07.294 - 00:38:28.278, Speaker A: And then once 80% of the network adopts that software version, then the feature is activated at the next epoch boundary. But if the folks running valid validators just decide, nope, we don't like that change, we're not going to upgrade the software. There's no way to force that through. But it's not running through like a DaO based governance. It is validator stake weighted governance.
00:38:28.326 - 00:39:08.964, Speaker B: Cool. No, no, that's, that's a very good start. And that's, that's one of the starting principles for me. It needs to be stakeholder based. So that that you already have that enshrined in the culture or in the social contract, I think is a very powerful thing. And I might also add one of the things that, you know, I don't think many people realize the significance of this, but one of the things that also makes Solana more attractive to me, and part of the reason why my view has changed is you also have multiple clients implementations on Solana. And I just think that's so crucial for any type of real decentralization, because if you only have one client implementation, it's effectively a one party system.
00:39:08.964 - 00:39:28.356, Speaker B: You only have one party that's actually competent at making changes, then, yeah, there's no choice. I mean, validators can vote, but they're voting for the one party. It doesn't make sense. Right, exactly. So in that sense, that now you have, I believe it's called fire dancer. Right. And there's some others maybe in the works as well, but that I find very.
00:39:28.356 - 00:39:50.530, Speaker B: That's one of the areas where I felt like BTC was very weak. And actually Ethereum has that as well. Ethereum actually has multiple clients implementations as well. To its credit, it's one of the things that really did right, along with totally smart contracts, along with its economic model. Just want to. I'm giving a lot of shade to Ethereum, but it's worthwhile pointing out the things it's got right. People find it difficult, right.
00:39:50.530 - 00:40:05.854, Speaker B: To kind of criticize something and then also praise it. I don't know. I found people, it's way too tribal sometimes to kind of. To be able to do that. It's like it's either all good or it's all bad. I find that a bit frustrating sometimes. Maybe I spend too much time on Twitter.
00:40:06.034 - 00:40:14.334, Speaker A: No, I think that is a lot of the worst parts about this space are sort of the idea that in order for my protocol to succeed, yours must fail.
00:40:14.454 - 00:40:14.758, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:14.806 - 00:40:30.046, Speaker A: And that is like, just so unhealthy because there's at most 30 million daily active users of blockchain. Like, the tam is so huge. Like, we don't need to be worried about, like, the ordinal rankings in the top ten chart, at least in my opinion.
00:40:30.150 - 00:41:27.738, Speaker B: Yeah, no, no, certainly. And I'm excited to see where Solana is going to go in terms of future governance mechanisms. I'm a big fan of self funding mechanisms, where you take part of the block award, put that towards the treasury, because that perverse incentive that I mentioned before, I think self funding mechanisms provide a l, one biased source of funding which can actually counteract the corruption of, say, external funding sources, and it potentially makes a blockchain more competitive. I will acknowledge there's a lot of waste in such a system, inefficiency in such a system as well. I think that trade off is highly worth it. Longer lock in periods to prioritize long term decision making over short term decision making, or some sort of curve. At least with the longer you lock it in, there's a lot of different things you can do in terms of the governance design to improve those outcomes.
00:41:27.738 - 00:42:16.464, Speaker B: And that's an area that I have a lot of interest in. Considering what's been happening in cryptocurrency, considering how some of the turns and pivots and twists have been pretty disappointing when it comes to ethereum for me, that's why I've started to see, okay, so I'm this big monolithic scaling advocate, and I really don't like this l two scaling roadmap. And I will also add, actually, I wanted to mention this because in my early critiques of Solana, I actually critiqued the lack of fee markets and attributed that to some of the instability. And I'll add, the Solana community is very graceful. There's a few people calling me out saying, I don't know what I'm talking about, but that's pretty power. The course, that's one thing about a completely voluntary system. You can't control who joins.
00:42:16.464 - 00:43:09.512, Speaker B: But I think that's most of my technical critiques from back then have actually been addressed. You have fee markets now. And so it fixed most of these technical critiques. And to me, that was very like a big deal. Combine that with the economic model, combine that with some basic on chain governance, combine that with multiple client implementations, and really, that Solana has, I'm going to be honest with you, I was kind of expecting the whole typical VC kind of pump and dump pattern where it's kind of, you have this hype cycle, and then predatory vc's kind of just dump and give up on the thing and then move on to the next thing, and then the hype cycle continues. And I've seen that so much in cryptocurrency. And that was somewhat, I have to admit, somewhat my expectation of Solana.
00:43:09.512 - 00:43:48.516, Speaker B: But then we kind of reached this point where it's like, hey, wait a second, the ecosystem is still being built up. It still has this kind of prominent mind share like past that kind of the normal kind of cycle there. And that's where I was like. And then today, where it's really gained a lot of, how do I put this kind of traction and become very representative of a symbol of monolithic scaling? Even you will. It's like, okay, this is now a natural ally to me. If I look at it objectively and all these different factors, then, yeah, I have to change my mind. And I'm happy that I did.
00:43:48.516 - 00:43:54.924, Speaker B: I'm always happy in these cases, at least, when I change my mind for the better. I'm always sad when I have to change my mind for the worse.
00:43:54.964 - 00:44:48.206, Speaker A: But so I actually want to go back to that and not to relitigate the early days and go point by point with you on that, because that's not good use of anyone's time. But when you first looked at Solana, what did you see that sort of gave you pause, and that sort of gave you that conviction to put out some messaging in the early days and as recent as sort of a year ago, talking about how you thought the salon of philosophy was wrong, what were the things that you as a researcher were looking at in the early days and being like, these are red flags for me. These give me concerns. And then we'll get into the follow up, too, of how your position actually changed on that as the years went on. But walk me through what that sort of initial research was like to the point where you felt it was worth publicly stating something like that.
00:44:48.360 - 00:45:44.232, Speaker B: Yeah, and I do a lot of public critiques of a lot of different cryptocurrencies. I wasn't just focused on Solana, obviously, but, yeah, I think for me, Solana takes a very extreme approach, you could say, to the dilemma. I mean, they are throwing, they have very high node requirements, let's say. So to me, I felt like that was, there's trade offs to be made in terms of scalability and decentralization. And I felt like Solana was going too far into those tradeoffs. I felt like it was making it too centralized, let's say it was making it too risky. I think there was a time period, I think over a year or two years, the network went down like twelve times or something like that.
00:45:44.232 - 00:45:49.896, Speaker B: I've lost, I know the last time I counted, at least it's debatable. Some people say eight, but I don't.
00:45:49.920 - 00:45:51.904, Speaker A: Know, more than was acceptable.
00:45:51.944 - 00:45:52.192, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:52.248 - 00:45:53.296, Speaker A: I think we can all agree on that.
00:45:53.320 - 00:46:18.548, Speaker B: I don't think a blockchain should go down at all, honestly. And other blockchains have shown that that can be done. So I felt like. But to its credit, it hasn't gone down now, for how long has it been like six months or something like that, or, I don't remember exactly February. Is that when? Right, so it's been a while at least. So I'm pretty pleased with that. Um, so to me, I felt like, okay, they're, when they're making these trade offs.
00:46:18.548 - 00:46:46.052, Speaker B: Right. And also I had a critique of a lack of fee markets. I was always of the belief that fee markets are actually critical, even in a highly scalable blockchain, to, to regulate and to like, prevent, you know, certain types of attacks or problems. Right. So was that it was that also combined with the non deterministic block production? That was also an issue for me somewhat, and I believe that's still the case. But the balance of the evaluation has changed.
00:46:46.188 - 00:47:14.456, Speaker A: What part of it, sorry, I'm curious, what part of the non deterministic block production? Because Solana's got a strange architecture where transactions have to say, here are all of the accounts and here's all the state I want to talk to before it executes. We often refer to that as deterministic transactions, whereas ethereum transactions are non deterministic, which is part of why you can only do one thing at a time.
00:47:14.520 - 00:47:16.616, Speaker B: I mean to say deterministic. Sorry.
00:47:16.800 - 00:47:17.360, Speaker A: Oh, okay.
00:47:17.392 - 00:47:22.184, Speaker B: Yeah, got it. Yeah, no, I didn't check all my notes before this, but.
00:47:22.224 - 00:47:23.072, Speaker A: No, no, you're good.
00:47:23.208 - 00:47:29.240, Speaker B: It was the fact that you're able to predict the next validator. That's what I mean, of deterministic.
00:47:29.392 - 00:47:31.584, Speaker A: The leader schedule is determined ahead of time.
00:47:31.624 - 00:48:19.212, Speaker B: Yeah. And I felt there's a trade off to be made there because that's potentially allows you to specifically target the next validators in line with potential DDoS attacks. And then it might be easier to reach a 51% threshold, potentially as well, using that type of attack. So that's something I was critical of in terms of the grand scheme of things. And that in particular was even particularly more problematic without fee markets because then you could also crash things a bit more and etcetera. So for me, it was really in the grand scheme of things. And I still think, I still think sharding, if I'm being completely honest, I still think sharding is a better approach in awe.
00:48:19.212 - 00:48:54.004, Speaker B: But actually I also see a future where potentially Solana might be shouted in the future as well. And I've seen some clients even do it not on the consensus layer, but, and I think that's also very interesting. I think paralyzation actually lends itself very well to that approach. But I think what made me change my mind. So those are some of the things I was critical towards, I think what made me change my mind is that nothing is perfect. And if I'm evaluating all these different factors, like, okay, sure, I like sharding more, okay. And I like non deterministic block production more.
00:48:54.004 - 00:49:05.208, Speaker B: Like, all those things are still true. I like fee markets. It did fix that. Right? I like multiple clients implementations. It fixed that. I like ETH's economic model. Solana also has that.
00:49:05.208 - 00:49:40.676, Speaker B: Right. So if I'm balancing, like, I'm saying, nothing is perfect, and I'm invested in over 30 different cryptocurrencies. Right? Nothing is perfect. So for me, to me, like, it's also, like, the best technologies don't always win, or what I think are the best technologies won't always win, you know, and also community matters. And also, like, a certain critical mass of defi activity matters a lot. Right? And I felt like Solana gained that. And what succeeds in markets is more than just about what I think is the quote, unquote, perfect design.
00:49:40.676 - 00:50:18.012, Speaker B: Something, sometimes something is just good enough. All right? And I think Solana is that. And sure, I still think sharding is technically a better approach, but Sloane is still able to achieve a very high TPS, and I also still believe in Moore's law. So I'll agree on that, too. Whether a sharded blockchain will become more dominant or whether Solana becomes more dominant, I'm okay with either scenario. I'm okay creating win win scenarios where it's not a take or market either. And so, in that sense, I'm reflecting.
00:50:18.012 - 00:51:08.514, Speaker B: And part of what I do internally as a researcher is we got price target models where we have over 100 different parameters that we evaluate in order to see, okay, what kind of point score does this give us relative to its current market capitalization? This is part of the value investing that I do. I'm like, okay, Solana scoring actually pretty high here. I have to be objective. I have to, like, bite my tongue after writing these extensive critiques and saying that, you know, Solana is terrible, that, you know what, Solana is actually pretty good, and face the backlash for that and have some damn intellectual honesty. Okay? And I think that's, I'm struggling a bit, as you can see, to explain my change of mind. But that's. I think that's it to a large part.
00:51:08.884 - 00:51:54.134, Speaker A: No, look, I appreciate you going through this. I know it's never easy to sort of say, hey, here was something I was vocal about, and here's a new opinion I have that's not congruous with that original one. I think this is something that is deeply lacking in the blockchain industry in general, is a willingness of people to admit when they've changed their mind, let alone to sort of come out and say publicly, hey, for the record, I have changed my mind. It doesn't mean I won't change it back again. But here's my current thinking. How did you sort of get personally comfortable with that idea that you were going to both articulate a very strong position and then potentially a few months later, articulate a very different position on the same topic?
00:51:54.474 - 00:53:13.160, Speaker B: Well, I think for me, I think my philosophy background I find incredibly helpful for me. So I think being able to reason and understanding, you know, rationality, these type of things, it's, it's, you know, and I've always been a big believer in, um, in, in Socrates living an examined life, right? To always question your own beliefs and always, you know, try to, you know, eliminate that bias is there's what I want to believe and there's truth, right? Based on my rationality, there's my emotional self. My emotional self might believe one thing, but then if I'm being objective and I'm actually applying my reasoning and my ability to argue and my ability to reason, then I think that's what's really helped me, and that's part of the enlightenment. It's part of the gift of philosophy that we have as part of our civilization. And I think I really believe in that. I really believe in pursuing truth and having intellectual honesty and being able to change my mind. I think that's so important, because if you can't change your mind and approach things with humility, you can never really learn.
00:53:13.160 - 00:54:07.518, Speaker B: You're, well, very limited, at least in your ability to learn and your ability to evolve. So I've really put that, I mean, in terms of my own ethos, I've put that front and center in terms of how I think about cryptocurrency and how I approach everything in life really well. Most things, at least in life, is I approach it with a very self examined perspective. And I think we need a lot more on that. In cryptocurrency, people get very emotional and tribal, and they get tunnel vision and they can't see the forest and the trees. And I think the ability to understand logical contradictions and fallacies and create argumentaries and all of these type of things are incredibly, incredibly powerful tools for clear thinking. I think in the modern world, I think people are, a lot of people, and I think you, you'd probably appreciate this as well.
00:54:07.518 - 00:54:30.428, Speaker B: A lot of. Well, I mean, so, so you refer to political science. I think there is. There's certainly a lot of science in political thought, but there's very large segments of political thought that are certainly not a science because they come down to subjective value judgments. And I think. I think. I think a lot of people in the modern world think that science can answer all of our questions, but it can't.
00:54:30.428 - 00:54:56.116, Speaker B: You know, science is an offshoot of philosophy, and there's things like, there's things that science can answer. Science can answer things about the material world and. And what the reality is of our material world. Right. Philosophy can answer things about, you know, right or wrong, or, you know, concepts, ideas, ideas that don't just exist in the. In our world. Ideas that exist in our mind.
00:54:56.116 - 00:55:45.176, Speaker B: So what is a good idea? What is a sound idea? What is an idea without contradiction? Can you make a pot and ideas like a pot that doesn't leak? You know, if you can't, if you can't poke holes in it, if you can't, if you can't contradict it, if you can't find any fallacy, then it's a good idea. And I think that's not in the realm of science, that's in the realm of philosophy. So I think understanding that distinction is important. And that's part of what I do in cryptocurrency, as a critic, is I try to think rationally about these things, and that's how I'm able to go against Ethereum. That's how I started in this world in 2013 as a passionate bitcoiner. I was able to evolve from going away from bitcoin and supporting bitcoin cash, actually. And I'm proud of that.
00:55:45.176 - 00:56:29.144, Speaker B: Even though I think there's a lot of misinformation around the history around that. I think maybe that's a bit beyond this podcast to get into that. And then leaving bitcoin, leaving bitcoin cash, going into ethereum now, becoming more critical of Ethereum and being more supportive of alternative layer ones. And I'm going to keep changing my mind. And some people might point that out as a weakness, but I think that's a strength, and that's because I'm really putting that front and center. And yeah, I really hope that if anyone calls me out for a contradiction or a mistruth, that I'm always able to correct myself, that I'm always able to say, hey, I'm wrong. And sometimes that I'm able to approach a subject with ignorance and have an open mind, you know?
00:56:29.964 - 00:57:15.478, Speaker A: Yeah. I like your piece on relying really heavily on this idea of science that maybe isn't something science actually ascribes to the sort of the scientism we've seen over the last few years. That's sort of taken over a lot of. A lot of thinking in place of where people maybe used to lean on philosophy. Now they've found this is sort of an interesting intersection of monotheism and programmer brain. That sort of, I think, leads you to thinking we're all living in a simulation, but then also leads you to thinking that there's one perfect technical solution, and if we can only get that, that somehow our perfect system will be achieved, which is very much feels like we're going back to 1890s philosophy.
00:57:15.606 - 00:57:34.214, Speaker B: Yeah. No, no, you're right. And I think a science. Sorry, a programmer brain. I like that, actually. That's that idea that like, oh, well, no, this is the scientific truth. Or when I hear bitcoiners or ethereum, a lot of ethereum community members now, they're saying, oh, no, no, all the scientists agree that this is the best approach.
00:57:34.214 - 00:57:51.674, Speaker B: Oh, no, this is scientific truth. How could you deny that? Layer two scaling is not the best approach. You know, that's. That's. And that's also the opposite of what good science is. Right? Good science should be able to question these things and also, you know, interject. But the interjecting of values, that's where philosophy comes in.
00:57:51.674 - 00:58:12.254, Speaker B: Right? So for me, a value is, hey, you know, users shouldn't be exposed to admin keys. What's science's opinion on that? I don't think science has an opinion on that. Right. There's a value here. Like what? Why do we. Why does science even care if people lose money? It doesn't. Right.
00:58:12.254 - 00:58:59.174, Speaker B: Human beings care. Philosophy cares about that. So, yeah, I think that's where we need to draw a certain line and that's where we need interject a little bit more of the humanities, because blockchain is not just a scientific experiment, it's a social experiment. I think people and social experiments are living things and we need to look at that objectively because we're part of it, which adds a certain bias being in it ourselves. Right. Historians in the future will be able to look back at this period with a lot more objectivity, but being part of it, we have to recognize that these are social experiments and we need to learn from them. And when they don't do what they're supposed to, and we unable to create course we need to iterate and we need to go to the next one and then we need to go to the next one until we get it right.
00:58:59.174 - 00:59:34.904, Speaker B: And that's, I think, where we are. That's why if Ethereum doesn't change course, it's going to be not the first biggest blockchain. It's not going to be the second biggest blockchain that's going to be dominant in the future. It's going to be these alternative layer ones, in my view. Because if you don't give people that capacity, if you don't empower people with scaling, then I think it's just the whole exercise becomes an excise in futility. If you don't have decentralized governance, it's all just decentralized theater. And that's not what I signed up for.
00:59:35.244 - 00:59:41.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you. Well, Justin, thank you so much for coming on validated today.
00:59:41.572 - 01:00:32.054, Speaker B: Thank you. This was a really good discussion. I really enjoy this and you've praised me a lot for changing my mind, and I'll take the opportunity just to praise you for so having the open mind to have me on here. Even though I've said some things about Solana that were pretty harsh, I can reflect on that now. And yeah, I really appreciate that and I'm just glad to speak to your community and I really want to promote the values of decentralization and I want cryptocurrencies to succeed. That's why I'm here to a large measure, and I don't care what free letter ticker achieves those goals. Ultimately, ultimately, I'm a pluralist and that's why, yeah, I'm here.
01:00:32.054 - 01:00:33.326, Speaker B: So thank you so much.
01:00:33.350 - 01:00:35.314, Speaker A: I respect that. Thank you.
01:00:41.174 - 01:00:44.054, Speaker B: You, our.
