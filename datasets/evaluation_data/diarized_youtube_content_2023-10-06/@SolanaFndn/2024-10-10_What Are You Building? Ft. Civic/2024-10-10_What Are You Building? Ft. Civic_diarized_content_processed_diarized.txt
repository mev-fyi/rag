00:00:00.280 - 00:00:24.137, Speaker A: Titus, what are you building? So we're building this cool thing called permission smart contracts. It's like this concept of having an identity component. When you're building these automations on chain, the way it works is you add a attestation on chain, like a signature if somebody's like a real person. And then you use that in your dapp to keep bad actors out. And you can do that with Civic Path. Now you can go to civic.com or go to docs.civic.com,
00:00:24.137 - 00:00:37.285, Speaker A: you can get a key for free, essentially, and start working on it. Like you can use Testnet Devnet for that as well. It's live on Solana, so go check it out, try it out. We're waiting to talk to you. If you have any issues, like any interesting use cases, let me know.
