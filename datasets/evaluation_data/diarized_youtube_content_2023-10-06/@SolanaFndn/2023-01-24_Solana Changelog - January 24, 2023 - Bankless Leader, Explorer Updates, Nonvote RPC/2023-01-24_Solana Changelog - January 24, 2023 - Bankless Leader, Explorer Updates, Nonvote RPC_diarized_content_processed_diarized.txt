00:00:00.640 - 00:00:28.578, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Welcome back. We are back again. Another week with some more changes, and this time we're going to break down what we saw for the week of the 13th through the 19th. So just want to quickly call out that we had a report come out. It was electric capital talking about some of our developer ecosystem updates, some of the stats around who's building on Solana. And they said that we are the fastest growing developer ecosystem, surpassing about 2000 devs in 2022.
00:00:28.578 - 00:00:45.754, Speaker A: So huge news, second only to ethereum. Great to hear that. And honestly, to all you guys who helped with that number and, like, are continuing to build, good on you. Happy to have you guys here and let us know what you need. But without further ado, let's get into the proposal. What did you guys see for that?
00:00:45.914 - 00:01:44.244, Speaker B: So the proposal highlight for this week is Simd zero zero five, which is bankless leader. And I think I've seen Anatoliaci speak a lot about this on Twitter, so it's quite an interesting one to look at. And so the banker's leader is a proposal that says that the leader isn't going to be responsible to execute transactions, is just going to do like, the minimum amount of work to produce a valid block. And all of the other validators in the networks who going to be receiving those entries, they're the ones that are responsible to execute those transactions. So this is quite good because then the lead, the, the leader would only be tasked with the ingress of transactions and sorting and filtering out the valid transactions, which actually allows it to kind of be more efficient in kind of like, packing and utilizing the block space. So it's quite an interesting one. Again, there's, like, lots of comments to kind of look at in the proposal.
00:01:44.784 - 00:01:49.844, Speaker C: Cool. Does that mean that there's going to be two leader schedules?
00:01:50.384 - 00:02:16.944, Speaker B: I didn't see that, but I think probably, like, the leader schedule stays the same. Just the one. But it's just that the current leader doesn't have to execute the transactions. When the entries are propagated to all the other validators in the network, they have to execute those transactions. I think the main difference is, like, the leader doesn't execute the transactions anymore. They're just responsible for filtering out the valid transactions and packing it into a block.
00:02:17.364 - 00:02:27.000, Speaker C: Okay, so you have that leader schedule of like, hey, there's one that's validating the block, and then there's one that is doing the packing the block and there's passing between the two.
00:02:27.172 - 00:02:27.872, Speaker B: Yep.
00:02:28.008 - 00:02:29.944, Speaker A: Oh, okay. That makes more sense.
00:02:30.104 - 00:02:59.804, Speaker C: Yeah. And then some commit highlights that we had this past week. So there are a lot of different changes that happened. So one is the get performance samples of adding non vote transactions to the RPC call has been added so it's counted on the bank. It's now exposed on an RPC call. So you can get better numbers of the tps running between like vote and non vote transactions. It can help, you can help out that that's going to be, I believe in 115.
00:02:59.804 - 00:03:41.764, Speaker C: So whenever we upgrade the cluster or if there's a RPC already running that, you can try that out. There's also a different set of things that are being built for like Explorer. There's like, hey, there's some misleading success logs that in the program instruction logs have been kind of fixed. And then there's like a toggle for raw transactions so that you can actually see the raw transaction. And then you can use that in like inspect or something on the Explorer. And I think there's also like support for monikers for the Solana tokens. So those are like short names on the different tokens and you can use those in the Explorer too.
00:03:41.764 - 00:04:20.344, Speaker C: And then kind of not exactly a change that's happening right now, but a kind of cool change that I would totally, if you have not look into. So there's something called, they're calling it program runtime v two. There's a lot of different changes that go into this. It's discussed in detail in the previous, last Friday's core community call. Definitely check out that video. And you can understand better of like from the engineers themselves of how does program run to runtimev two work and what does it bring to the table for developers? A lot of really cool developer improvements.
00:04:21.764 - 00:04:27.584, Speaker A: Very interesting. You guys covered that in the core contributor call then? Core community call.
00:04:28.004 - 00:04:32.984, Speaker C: Core community call, which happens currently once a month. So it happened last Friday.
00:04:33.804 - 00:04:46.204, Speaker A: That's excellent to hear. Yeah, a lot of really cool stuff there. And you know, some of it's like kind of further out, but it'll get you excited. If you've ever like written a lot of on chain stuff, you'll know exactly what they're talking about.
00:04:46.284 - 00:04:46.944, Speaker C: Cool.
00:04:47.244 - 00:04:56.780, Speaker A: Yeah. So for resources, we came across a particularly awesome course that, you know, these guys that threw this together, guys, either.
00:04:56.812 - 00:05:24.974, Speaker C: Of you, they just kind of reached out to us saying that here's a course that we built. And when we had some people review it, they said it was one of the best courses that they saw. So this course is by career booster. They created a full Solana and rush programming course for beginners up until intermediate developers so that you can get started on Solana just from nothing, basically using this course.
00:05:25.534 - 00:05:44.174, Speaker A: Yeah, and I went through it a little bit too. It is well put together. It's done by two people named Mick and Blaze, according to, like, the homepage there. So shout out to you guys, thanks for putting this together. And your site gives me a lot of, like, Tony Hawk's pro skater vibes. I dig it. So, you know, great job, great course.
00:05:44.174 - 00:05:47.914, Speaker A: Happy to be sharing that around and helping use that to get people onboarded.
00:05:48.574 - 00:05:48.998, Speaker C: Yep.
00:05:49.046 - 00:05:55.162, Speaker B: And I think that's actually built by the team called Ideasoft, based out in Ukraine. So that's quite interesting.
00:05:55.338 - 00:05:56.930, Speaker A: Idsoft. Okay, cool.
00:05:57.042 - 00:06:07.754, Speaker C: That's awesome. All right, so thank you for once again coming and listening on to the different changes that we go through each week. We'll see you next week. Ciao.
