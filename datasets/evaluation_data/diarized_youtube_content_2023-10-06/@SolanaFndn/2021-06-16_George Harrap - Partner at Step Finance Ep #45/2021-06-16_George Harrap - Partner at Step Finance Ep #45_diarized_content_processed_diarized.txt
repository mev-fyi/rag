00:00:12.440 - 00:00:20.590, Speaker A: Hey, folks, this is Anatoly, and you're listening to the Solana podcast. And today I have George with me who is one of the co founders of SEp Finance.
00:00:20.702 - 00:00:22.310, Speaker B: Nice to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:00:22.382 - 00:00:29.622, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. I'd love for you to introduce yourself and let folks know how you got into crypto and blockchain.
00:00:29.718 - 00:01:01.262, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I mean, I've kind of been in crypto for a bit over ten years now, so checking crypto and building companies in this space and all this kind of stuff, it's been kind of every day of my life for the last ten years. So, yeah. Early bitcoin miner, first with AsiCs, was one of the first batches of those was first batch FPGA's. It was 1% of the bitcoin hash rate at some stage. And that's sort of how I got into it was, you know, when bitcoin was just a. A website for a bunch of nerds on the Internet.
00:01:01.262 - 00:01:28.578, Speaker B: There was no anything, really. There was a bitcoin.org website, an IRC chat, that's about it. But it sort of piqued my interest because I was interested in electronics engineering at the time. So, yeah, I got into it just mining and building stuff in my room, you know, GPU, sort of cherry rigged setups and so on. And, yeah, essentially, in 2014, I decided to move to Hong Kong. Started crypto remittance company, was the first crypto remittance company called Bitspark.
00:01:28.578 - 00:02:04.488, Speaker B: We operated in about six different countries, sending money around the world using crypto faster, cheaper and so on. And, yeah, I think sort of through that journey led me to where we're currently at in Solana, and what we're doing at step finance. I got together a team of a couple of friends of mine who I've known again for years, have also been in crypto for quite a while. And we thought, you know what, one of the things that's really missing in the Defi ecosystem is a DCA sort of contract. That's how we got started, was just building a DCA contract. Wasn't possible on Ethereum, way too expensive, not really that scalable. We looked at Solana, we entered the hackathon.
00:02:04.488 - 00:02:43.754, Speaker B: Just betting hackathon. I think that was great earlier this year. And, yeah, essentially from there we decided that, you know what? The DCA is good, but what Solana is really lacking is one sort of place to bring everything together, right? So it's like all of your positions in one spot where you can visualize everything. It's not like oh, can you like go check on this random website over here where your money's at? And I don't even know what's happening with that money because it's like not linked in one place to the other money over here and a different LP. So yeah, just bringing everything together in one place and that's sort of where we're at with step now is being this portfolio manager and aggregator across the Solana ecosystem.
00:02:43.874 - 00:03:20.414, Speaker A: That's awesome. That's cool that you got into this. Just reminding, I think people really forget how janky everything was and how weird it was to even like start doing that. I remember looking at bitcoin when it was pretty early days. There's still people mining with CPU's and I was like, I'm a firmware engineer, I can build an FPGA for this. And then like immediately there was an FPGA out and somebody announced an ASIC. And the hilarious thing was that they delayed shipping the ASIC to customers so they couldn't find it first.
00:03:21.814 - 00:03:45.870, Speaker B: I flew to Kansas City to actually go and see them building it. Yeah, it was like that was delayed six months and so on and that sort of thing. Right? So, yeah, it's pretty crazy. I took out a loan to buy that thing, which I couldn't afford. I was a student at the time. I was working just a crappy job, you know, sort of doing a degree on the side, but I took out a loan like whatever the max the bank would give me. And I think it was like twenty k at the time.
00:03:45.870 - 00:03:51.994, Speaker B: I'm just like put it into mining. Six month delay, but eventually it paid itself off, which is all good.
00:03:52.974 - 00:04:08.514, Speaker A: Yeah, that was like the least worst scam in all of crypto history. Of all the scams that came after, those guys actually built hardware. They just like needed some cash flow.
00:04:10.174 - 00:04:19.876, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Like, it could have been great. They could have made something of it. It could have been a great company in the ecosystem. But yeah, hey, sometimes it doesn't go that way.
00:04:19.980 - 00:04:44.548, Speaker A: Yeah, it like really, I think in my mind, like really made me understand what crypto was. It was this like weird wild west free for all of people building everything they can think of. And I find that like, it's the most exciting part of the space is that like, anything is possible that you can, you can kind of like have these wild ideas and go out and do them.
00:04:44.596 - 00:04:45.084, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:04:45.164 - 00:05:02.988, Speaker A: When you guys kind of started building out this idea for Sep finance, are you thinking about solving today's problems that all this stuff is extremely awkward. Or do you imagine a world where DeFi is finance? We're no longer calling it Defi. It's just called finance.
00:05:03.076 - 00:05:26.092, Speaker B: Yeah. I think about this quite a lot, and I often say that I'm most excited about crypto now than I have in, you know, since my early mining days. Like, back in the early days, it was like, wow, this thing's whole. It's new. It's got so much potential. Like, you know, we can go a long way from here. And I think it's that sort of matured over the years of, okay, there's this thing called bitcoin.
00:05:26.092 - 00:05:44.804, Speaker B: You can use it to pay for stuff. Okay. You know, it's a coin, and you can trade it and it's another currency. But I think when we're talking about Defi, like, you're actually talking about a lot more than that. You're talking about a whole financial system. And I can't see myself going back to the old ways of an old financial system. Like, every time I use a bank, I just get mad.
00:05:44.804 - 00:06:19.956, Speaker B: It's just annoying. It's terrible to use. Like, right now, I have some bank who's asking me for an empty 103 that's like a trace using the Swift network that costs $50. All of this would be so much simpler if banks just had a TX id, right? So in the defi world, like, just problems of sending people money or getting a loan or any of these things are just so much, like, infinitely simpler and better and cheaper and more transparent and so on. So I don't really see a world where we go back to the way things were. I think we only go forward. Defi only continues to grow.
00:06:19.956 - 00:06:42.184, Speaker B: And, yeah, maybe it's not called, like, decentralized finance. There's probably going to be people that slap a logo on top and a pretty app and stuff and make it usable for the masses, and that's fine. But the point is that the underlying infrastructure is a quantum leap for whatever the traditional system is using. And I'm pretty excited about that whole setup.
00:06:42.304 - 00:07:25.264, Speaker A: Yeah, me too. I think it's almost like a necessity. There's just no way that government run bureaucracies can't keep up with how big the finance world is getting. It's almost like the 2008 crisis was like, there's no way for them to analyze all the data. And Defi seems like a necessity in the sense that you can actually sandbox the risks and protocols you have borrow lending with clear risk factors that everybody can compute. It really seems like if you didn't have that. You're just going to have these crazy traders, like that guy from a family office that took up 50 billion in leverage, just lost it all in one day.
00:07:25.264 - 00:07:37.130, Speaker A: Yeah. Talk about, what is it? Shiba token is like, everybody knows what it is. We don't have to pretend.
00:07:37.202 - 00:08:17.694, Speaker B: Well, I think the legacy system is, like, just getting memed to death. Like, you mentioned Shiba token, right? Like, everyone's just buying, like, dog coins and whatever they can find because they know that the whole system's kind of a bit nonsense. So might as well just go and buy a dog coin, right? And see if you can make some money while you're at it, right? So I think we're in that transition phase where people are sort of realizing that, you know what? Like, I'm not going to be logging onto my bank and then not working between the hours of 05:00 p.m. And 09:00 a.m. And not being available for two days a week and, you know, taking a week to send someone money, like, that's just a fundamentally bad system, and I think everyone agrees, so it's just a matter of time, I think.
00:08:17.814 - 00:08:54.542, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. This was, like, maybe six months ago. I was in a chat with Andrew, and he kind of referred himself as level three developer that he's not working on the core protocols. He's just trying to make applications for humans that really try to, like, make it easy to do all this stuff. And I thought that was enormous sign of maturity of the space that we're, like, past the point of people trying to do all this, like, low level, like, geeky stuff. They still are, right? There's still a big pile of innovation there. Do you kind of see yourself at that point? Like, you guys are, like, actually building products for humans?
00:08:54.718 - 00:09:27.910, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I guess, you know, I wouldn't compare myself or us to Andre, but certainly, like, building products for humans, I think, is. Is important. But on the other hand, like, I also think that people will get there. So there's sort of two approaches, right? There's a lot of people that are building very geeky products, you know, tech people, high barrier to entry. You've got to understand crypto. I used to think that that was a bad model or at least something that couldn't gain enough traction. But I think over the last, say, year or two, crypto has gained so much traction.
00:09:27.910 - 00:10:00.606, Speaker B: There's so many users that are just using it natively, that it's actually okay for that to be your target audience. So I think you can build a viable business just based on people that are in crypto. I mean, it's, I don't know, like 50 million, 60 million. Last time I heard a number of people that are, like, natively in crypto that's only going to grow and go up. But, yeah, having said that, there certainly will be a place for these portals into and out of the system. I spent a lot of years solving the fiat problem with remittances, right. So sending money in and out for countries in the world that don't have a viable banking system.
00:10:00.606 - 00:10:30.276, Speaker B: So, like, if you're in Indonesia and you're in a small village, like, you know, you're not using Defi to do stuff, so you've got to use some sort of portal to get into and out of this system. So I think people will be using these portals and, yeah, I think they probably will be on the edge of the infrastructure divide between, like, the DeFi systems and the tradfi systems. And there's probably a lot of value to be had there. But ultimately, I think everyone will just start doing stuff in DeFi. If you can. Like, if you can, you will. Yeah.
00:10:30.300 - 00:11:13.670, Speaker A: The 50, 60 million number is really interesting. I remember the Internet was like around 40 million in 1996. That's when I started using it. I was like AOL, basically. And I thought it was really, really exciting when a few years later, when you started getting to 150 million people, you saw things like six degrees, MySpace and those rapidly built on top of each other until you hit Facebook. Those applications that connect massive numbers of people, I think, are coming in crypto and pretty excited what that'll look like. I think that's when we'll start seeing the inflection point of going from.
00:11:13.670 - 00:11:15.374, Speaker A: This is not DeFi, it's just finance.
00:11:15.414 - 00:11:15.566, Speaker B: Right?
00:11:15.590 - 00:11:22.966, Speaker A: There's like, the Aave bank has a trillion under management and running on Solana, I hope, but we'll see.
00:11:23.110 - 00:11:45.400, Speaker B: Exactly. Like to segue Solana in there. I think in many countries of the world, and probably the majority of the world's population, fees are a big problem. So, like, having something that's scalable and cheap is really important. And also the local currencies, there's 180 different countries in the world. Most of them have their own different currencies and they're all terrible. None of them really hold value.
00:11:45.400 - 00:12:21.402, Speaker B: So, like, if you're in, you know, Nigeria, you don't really want naira. If you're in Ghana, you don't want setis. This is not a long term play. Everyone knows it's kind of a nonsense thing. So I think people want to get into a system where they can not only the stored value sort of narrative, but be able to do stuff that they couldn't otherwise because they were geographically limited. And I think you've got to have a system kind of like what Solana is doing low cost fast, to be able to reach that point. Like, these people are not going to be paying dollar 80 in uniswap fees to swap a coin on Ethereum.
00:12:21.402 - 00:12:47.520, Speaker B: So there's got to be some sort of solution there to bridge the gap. And that's why I think the rise of these, you know, Defi chains in the last sort of year has been really good for the system. Like, there's just more products, there's more people building stuff, and that's good, and that gets more humans into the system. And, yeah, I think, you know, there's obviously Solana is, you know, a great use case, but, yeah, just the more people using defi, the better, wherever they happen to come in from. So, yeah.
00:12:47.592 - 00:12:57.042, Speaker A: Do you think. Do you think people will trust. Do you think people trust bitcoin to the level more so than their local currencies already?
00:12:57.178 - 00:13:20.430, Speaker B: I think so, yeah. I think. I'll give you an example. Like, a couple of years ago, I was invited to Tajikistan with the UN. That was part of, you know, what we were doing at bitspark at the time. But in that country, two banks collapsed and everyone lost their money, and that was within, like, the last five years. So, like, if you were in that country, like, your opinion of the financial system is, like, you have no opinion of the financial system.
00:13:20.430 - 00:13:57.390, Speaker B: They just lose the money. People use taxi drivers and bags of cash to send it around. So I think that it's very geographical specific, but most of these people will be digital natives. They will look at something like crypto as the solution to this financial problem of storing their money. Maybe they think they get into bitcoin and they look at the stored value narrative, and that's great, cool, whatever. But I think fundamentally, if you need to transact, you're probably going to look at some sort of defi solution. Maybe it's a stable coin that you want to use or get a loan in or something like that, so there's just fundamentally way more options.
00:13:57.390 - 00:14:04.910, Speaker B: And, yeah, it's much better than being geographically bound to whatever horrible sort of fiat system you're currently in.
00:14:05.062 - 00:14:18.928, Speaker A: Are people looking for. Are they afraid of, like, the bitcoin volatility? Is that a thing? Or people, like, actually, like, fully committed to believing that even if there's short term volatility, that it's the future.
00:14:19.016 - 00:14:44.480, Speaker B: I think people certainly are wary of volatility. The thing is, like, we all, when we talk about volatility. Volatility compared with what? Reference to what? That's the question to ask, right? So if you reference it to USD, then sure. Like, it can be quite volatile. If you reference, like, people, the old adage of, oh, one bitcoin is always one bitcoin. It's like, cool. When people start thinking that way, then it won't matter.
00:14:44.480 - 00:15:44.094, Speaker B: But right now, it does matter, and people still reference it to paying the rent in their local currency. So I think as long as people are still paying the rent in their local currency, volatility will be a thing, people will be concerned about it, and it's always going to be there. But we might reach a point, an inflection point in the world, like, where it becomes like, if 5% of your gdp is using crypto, it's kind of a small problem, and then maybe 10% and then maybe 15%. At what point in time do the scales tip? And everyone just goes, well, might as well just go all in on this crypto thing, because everyone, it's just a fundamentally better way. You've got a mobile app, maybe from one country or currency, that's limiting, and then you've got this whole defi ecosystem, which is unlimited. So what are you going to choose? So I think that are we going to get to a point where it goes from, like, 5% of GDP to 50% of GDP? Like, is it ever going to go back to 1%? I don't know. I don't really see it going backwards.
00:15:44.094 - 00:15:49.622, Speaker B: I only see it really going forwards, and I think that's going to be good for the world.
00:15:49.718 - 00:16:15.784, Speaker A: Yeah, it really feels like it's only going to go forwards at this point. I don't know when the growth is going to slow down. Maybe at the 50 percentile. Yeah, I guess one thought that I kind of. I've been curious is, are you guys thinking of, like, a future where you're like a neo bank? Like that there's like, build pay and, like, consumer banking services and sub finance. Like, is that part of. Part of the vision?
00:16:15.824 - 00:16:41.824, Speaker B: No, I mean, I've looked at that world, to be honest. So it's just like, there is a lot of moving pieces, and often the moving pieces are terrible to manage and very disparate. Like, there's no API for banking. Right? Like, like, I used the example of Indonesia, 80% of the population don't have a bank account. Okay, cool. How are you going to reach them? Okay, well, you need a cash in, cash out, endpoint. What are they using? 711 equivalent.
00:16:41.824 - 00:16:59.008, Speaker B: Okay, does 711 have an API? No, they don't. Even if they do, it's terrible. So it's like you have to do a lot of work to try and solve this problem. And I think it's better for us at step to just be focusing on like, okay, people will be out there providing these portals into and out of this world.
00:16:59.056 - 00:16:59.510, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:59.632 - 00:17:22.174, Speaker B: And once you're in this world, then, hey, we're happy to be that portal for you and tell you what's happening and link you to all the different projects and aggregate and blah, blah, blah. But yeah, sort of solving that piece of in and out. Happy to partner with people that are solving the problem, but we certainly don't want to dip our hands into getting involved in all of that space because it can get messy pretty quick.
00:17:22.514 - 00:17:52.934, Speaker A: Yeah, it is like, like you said, it is extremely a bunch of annoying problems that are really hard to scale. Like, it's hard for like a small team to go solve them all. I don't know if it's like such a huge barrier to adoption yet. I think, like you said, people that are really interested in crypto, they'll find a way to get into it, and once they're in, they're in. And it's almost like if they weren't interested in it, it doesn't matter how low the barrier to entry would be, they're not going to jump in anyway.
00:17:53.314 - 00:18:26.550, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, maybe there's a point where people don't need to like quote, be interested in crypto to get in. Like, I see some of these defi protocols that just focus on the lending and they're like, hey, we're just a savings account and that's it. We just give you x percent in us dollar coins and that's like a really easy value proposition for people to understand. You don't have to think too hard, you don't have to think about collateralizing loans and blah, blah, blah. So, yeah, I think that it will just branch out into lots of different specializations. Some people will solve the simple problem problems, some people will tackle the hard problems. That's cool.
00:18:26.622 - 00:18:34.942, Speaker A: Yeah. What is your vision for like step finance in the next five years? Like kind of the, where do you guys want to see yourself?
00:18:35.118 - 00:19:11.146, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, we started step as well for the hackathon. It was originally, the concept was a DCA contract. Right so it was a place where you put your money and you can buy crypto over some set time period. We branched beyond that being this platform where everyone can visualize not only their investments, but also we want to integrate with all of these other projects and be able to have it all there in one place. But what we also talk a lot about is the aggregation piece, the analysis piece as well. So in the case of Solana, there's a lot of disparate components.
00:19:11.146 - 00:19:53.676, Speaker B: There's like three different amms. They're not connected together. Even within the amms, liquidity pools are not really connected together via a router. There's a lot of small little problems which we think that we can at least help to resolve there in terms of maybe being this aggregation layer across the Solana ecosystem for people swapping or people yield farming. I really appreciate you mentioned, Andre, before, what yearn has been doing in the yield farming space. I think that's a space as well for investment. People want to put their money somewhere, they want to get a number apy out and that's it.
00:19:53.676 - 00:20:30.756, Speaker B: And they want to kind of forget about it. So, you know, yield farming and aggregation, I think is another play for us. So yeah, you know, it's, there's a couple of these different value accrual mechanisms which we're looking to add to step. And our vision is firstly, we've got to be that place that has the user attention. I think of step a lot as monetizing user attention. So we all have these tabs which we look at every day, like Coingecko, everyone uses their metamask on ethereum every day. They're these places, these things which you use every day, and they always have user attention.
00:20:30.756 - 00:21:14.914, Speaker B: We want step to be that place and we see that as hugely valuable. So if you're always checking step or managing your portfolio via step, that is great, that's the position we want to be in. So I think success for us means that are we doing that and are we the place that people want to be, and are we keeping everyone's attention? If we're not, then we've got work to do. If we are, then great, let's keep doing it. So yeah, I think for us at step, it's the aggregation play, it's the visualization play, the portfolio management. But yeah, it's just being that place that has people's attention and you have people's attention if you're doing useful stuff for them. So we've got to do useful stuff for people, otherwise we won't have their attention.
00:21:14.914 - 00:21:19.998, Speaker B: So, yeah, there's a lot of things baked into that, but that's the general overview.
00:21:20.086 - 00:21:55.492, Speaker A: That's awesome. The use case, I think, is one that I really like, because it is at that human level that we don't have to innovate at some, like the finance side or point even the layer one side, but it ties things together. One of the things that I really care about is this idea of censorship resistance and how DeFi can enable it. Just wondering what you guys think about layer ones, and what is the function of these systems in your mind? What are we supposed to do for you?
00:21:55.668 - 00:23:06.684, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think Defi isn't defi unless it has some censorship resistance. Right? So now, I used to think that it was a binary question, is it decentralized or is it not? And people will then go, okay, well, how do we measure decentralization? And then they'll spout about proof of work and mining pools, and then somebody will say, well, three pools have 51%. And people go, no, the miners can control, you know, all the node operators. So I think now, I actually think that decentralization probably more on a spectrum, and there's a lot of different ways that you can think about decentralization. But the fundamental principle, I think, is that somebody can't control your money for you, and they can't make decisions for you. I think if it is the case where someone can make a decision that can control your money or account or wallet or something like that, then I would say that that is centralization, and we need to steer away from that. So, yeah, I think that censorship resistant for l one s, there's probably only really a few out there which have a good shot at it in the DeFi world, right? We've got ethereum, we've got Solana.
00:23:06.684 - 00:24:02.354, Speaker B: BSc has been getting traction, and there's people talking about other ones, but it's pretty much those three at the moment, which have a lot of the users and the attention. Now, people say a lot of things about the other two, but I would say that in the Solana world, like, things are fast, things are, I would say, sufficiently decentralized for it to meet the criteria of, nobody can control my money and nobody can make decisions for me. I think if we can achieve that and meet that goal, then that's the main thing. And, yeah, I think that all l one should focus on just being that place. And if you can provide the right developer tools, like, people will come and people will start building on it, and it's really up to the app developers and the Dapp developers and whatever, to go and build the use cases. Right. It's the l one's job to be that solid foundation and it's everyone else's job to go and build cool stuff that's useful.
00:24:02.354 - 00:24:11.870, Speaker B: So nobody's going to build cool stuff that's useful if the foundation is like quicksand. So, yeah, it's important to have a solid foundation. Yeah.
00:24:11.902 - 00:24:38.224, Speaker A: Also, I mean, if the layer one tries to build everything, you end up in the same kind of problem. I think consensus did a lot of good work for Ethereum, but also, like, metamask is the main wallet that people use and it's not great and is innovating at a pretty slow pace. Same thing with infuria and like Etherscan, despite like, those are kind of the standards. If they were like teams that were like, hungry, they would move a lot faster.
00:24:38.844 - 00:24:39.484, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:39.604 - 00:24:54.952, Speaker A: You as a founder, do you guys, like, see the growth right now? Are you grow as fast as you can mode or are you, let's build product, let's iterate and zero in on the use case.
00:24:55.128 - 00:25:36.622, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, for us right now, we've had a few things happening in the last month, shall we say, before the token launch, we were just focused on building out some basic integration. So hooking up with mangoes, orca serum pools, being able to show you what's happening on your dashboard. Okay, that's a very basic MVP, and that's something that we can get out there. Number two is we had a token launch, and the idea behind the token is it's a way to create user stickiness. And one of the things, like getting back to my previous comments about being that place which has users attention, having a token certainly helps achieve that. So that sort of furthers our goal of being this place that has a user's attention.
00:25:36.622 - 00:26:19.156, Speaker B: And once you have their attention, well, they're going to be doing stuff on your platform. So there's all of these different productive things which you can do, which can pay a fee or earn fees, and then that goes back to token holders, and you have a closed loop system there. So for us at the moment, we're still kind of in the build phase when we're just connecting with all of these different projects. Probably most projects on Solana right now have a private group with us to talk about integration in some way. And what does that mean? Well, it just means just being that place that we can at least get information from these different contracts and display it for the user. That's sort of where we're at right now. So probably the next couple of weeks, months just focused on integrations and these sorts of things.
00:26:19.156 - 00:26:57.332, Speaker B: After that, it's more about this value accrual, the different fee paying things. What would people pay a fee for? What are they willing to pay a fee for? Once you have their attention, are they willing to use your service to. To do something else, which maybe they could do elsewhere? But the point is that they're with you right now, they're not elsewhere. So you need to be able to make sure that you can be able to monetize that and get on top of it. So for us, the sort of the value accrual stuff is maybe a later stage. So probably two months from now or something. But, yeah, for us right now it's just about these integrations.
00:26:57.332 - 00:27:02.926, Speaker B: It's getting coverage of the ecosystem and. Yeah, just being that place that, that everyone wants to be in Solana.
00:27:03.030 - 00:27:22.166, Speaker A: Awesome. That's a great vision. It's a fun time to be in that moment in the company's life as you guys doing these integrations. What kind of, like, there's a hackathon going on. What would you want people to work on? What is like a missing piece in the Defi ecosystem?
00:27:22.230 - 00:27:57.472, Speaker B: Yeah, I always say to the people that are looking to integrate, it's like, if you can make our lives easier, then that's the best thing. So many of these different platforms, they might be like, they might have a custom API or something which is maybe not in a production ready state or something like that. So that's probably something which is not going to be easier for us to integrate and focus on. But I think that there's a lot of teams out there that are building the useful blocks that we've seen happen on Ethereum before. So, like lending protocols. Right. I want to see more of them.
00:27:57.472 - 00:28:48.994, Speaker B: There's a couple of, like, stablecoin different solutions as well, which I think we can sort of grow on Solana and have a lot of native uses for that. There's prediction markets coming up, there's NFT marketplaces, which I think is. Is interesting. I think that's probably a space which can do really well on Solana because NFTs is. It captures a different audience to the Defi people. Like, we've seen that in the media recently, right? Like people are getting their first taste of crypto, buying some JPEG images for like $1,000. I'm joking, of course, but I think Solana being this cheap and fast way for people to be able to do that gives a good opportunity there for builders to like make Solana the NFT place because, yeah, why would you be paying massive fees to be using nfts? Normal people don't want to do that.
00:28:48.994 - 00:29:22.750, Speaker B: New people to crypto, they don't want to do that. So I think there's a good opportunity there. And yeah, at the end of the day, I don't really know what they will come up with in the latest hackathon. I'm just super pumped to see what it is and whatever it is, we want to be that place that is integrating Natad and showing your product to the world. So we have a couple of things that we're working on where we might have like a showcase of platforms which can do x functionality. And that might be. I mentioned lending before, right.
00:29:22.750 - 00:29:52.652, Speaker B: And it might be able to show you a bunch of different platforms that are all doing lending. And, you know, what can they provide you? What are the rates, what's happening with them, this kind of stuff, and just put it all in one spot. So it's kind of like we want to help these projects get more exposure as well. So I think that's another thing that would be exciting as well to try and kickstart them and just put them in front of an audience because at the moment it's kind of like, hey guys, come use my product. You've never heard of me. I came into existence a week ago. That's about it.
00:29:52.652 - 00:30:04.468, Speaker B: Hope you find my website. But if you're actually on this one place step and then we're exposing people to that, then maybe we can help increase the traction in Solana ecosystem.
00:30:04.596 - 00:30:25.338, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm super excited about the hackathon, too. We it's double the number of registrations since last time. It doesn't mean that there's 7000 rust devs out there, but I think if there's, if there's somebody in crypto that can write a lick of code, I think they've heard about the Solana hackathon. So we want to see what people accomplish.
00:30:25.506 - 00:30:27.354, Speaker B: Yeah, that'd be awesome.
00:30:27.474 - 00:30:45.684, Speaker A: Are you guys, since I find that, like, folks that started in bitcoin first tend to be way more receptive to rust than people that are coming from Ethereum. What's kind of your impression on contract development or like smart contract development?
00:30:45.804 - 00:31:24.402, Speaker B: Yeah, I think certainly Rust has a long way to go in terms of the dev tooling and the support documentation, these sorts of things. Certainly one thing Ethereum's done well is it has a lot of those tools that are already built out. So if you're like a new dev to the ecosystem, like you can, there's all of these different things which you can go and look at and use every day in your workflow. Not quite there yet for a lot of what's happening in the Solana ecosystem, but it is getting built. And B, it's still early days. Ethereum's been around for quite a while, and Solana is newer. I think it will eventually get there.
00:31:24.402 - 00:32:03.024, Speaker B: I think it also puts a barrier to entry for quality on Solana. What we've seen with BSC being EVM compatible, you just see a lot of copy pastes, right? And there's a lot of projects which, like, change a logo, go put it on another chain, and hey, presto, I just launched a project. Solana is kind of immune to that because of the rust barrier. So you have to level up if you're going to build something on Solana, which I think is probably a good thing. And it means that the people that are doing stuff on Solana probably need to think about things a lot more, which is great. And, yeah, the quality of the projects rises. So, yeah, I think that the dev tools will get there.
00:32:03.024 - 00:32:37.674, Speaker B: We've certainly. My co founder, Aaron Zero V, he's been getting stuck into it. He didn't know rust beforehand, taught himself long term c developer. So I think it's welcoming for people from that perspective, is that, look, if you know some c, you can probably get into rust, and then you can just start making cool stuff on Solana. It's fairly straightforward. I guess you've just got to maybe do a little bit more work than a solidity tutorial, of which there are many, but that'll come in time.
00:32:38.134 - 00:33:04.456, Speaker A: Yeah, that was an unexpected result of this, that this barrier to entry filtered out for really high quality. And we were pleasantly surprised. That was a key part to early bitcoin days, too, that this understanding that you need to go build these optimized GPU systems, the people that were willing to do that were not like, your typical day to day. Like, people just seeking to make a buck.
00:33:04.520 - 00:33:04.816, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:04.880 - 00:33:25.036, Speaker A: They actually understand, like, PCI buses and things like that and go through the. Right. Like, I think that that's really important to building a community. Like, for folks that are, like, out there building stuff, you know, focus on quality, like first. You can always optimize for quantity later.
00:33:25.220 - 00:34:05.408, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think. And it's also good for the early people that have that skill to be incentivized to, like, be the first ones to go in there and build something cool. Right. So, you know there is a, there's a high Roi for the time that you spend doing something in this space. Like you use the bitcoin mining perspective, right? Like there is high Roi. If you put in the effort to understand these command line bitcoin mining algos, like back in the day, your time was well spent doing that. I think the same is true for learning how to make adapt your time productivity wise versus something else that you could be doing.
00:34:05.408 - 00:34:16.916, Speaker B: Like the ROI for this is way higher. So I think certainly have a look at it because there's probably not too many other things that would have such a good use of your productive time.
00:34:17.020 - 00:34:23.172, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I think this is kind of the highest leverage software you can write right now are smart contracts.
00:34:23.268 - 00:34:23.944, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:24.764 - 00:34:32.428, Speaker A: Are you worried at all about like the stacking of risk between, like all of these protocols?
00:34:32.556 - 00:35:31.354, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, in my previous days at my last company with remittances, like we, we built six exchanges, we launched 13 stable coins, we built our own router. Like all of these different things between these different chains, having our own nodes, things going down at the 02:00 a.m. And who's on to fix it? Oh, we're asleep and the person is not awake for another 6 hours. And users around the world are getting mad because things are not working. So, yeah, those problems, one of the cool things is that if you're building in this space, there's maybe less of them, or like a lot of the backend infrastructure is kind of outsourced to the blockchain itself, which is pretty cool. So that's what I appreciate a lot about this space, is the ability to build these things that are fairly lightweight, and you don't have to be worried that things are going to go down in the middle of the night. Obviously.
00:35:31.354 - 00:36:26.484, Speaker B: Still, building a rust contract which custodies people's money, that's high risk, and it could all disappear tomorrow. So I think for us, we want to focus on building on top of things which already exist and finding the value added mechanisms there which are kind of a light lift. That's at least our strategy for the moment, is that if we get too stuck into looking at building our own ground up rust contracts to do some crazy investment strategy, sure, we could do that, but I think our time is probably more productively spent elsewhere at the moment. And it's a lot less stress when you're trying to grow at the moment. Like growth in the early stages is like, you got to be pumping stuff out, you've got to have things to be able to show, and that probably doesn't mean spending the next four months building a rust program and then takes another two months to get audited. And even then, it's not really a surefire thing. Right.
00:36:26.484 - 00:36:36.460, Speaker B: Like, it could disappear tomorrow. So, yeah, we're weary of it, but we kind of want to focus on the areas which don't involve that high level of risk.
00:36:36.572 - 00:36:58.124, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good strategy. I think what I found that's really important in any kind of development is how quickly you ship product and iterate. This isn't every Silicon Valley startup book. Ship as fast as you can. Listen to your customers. Iterate. Do it again.
00:36:58.124 - 00:37:19.880, Speaker A: I wonder if, like, a lot of what has to do with, like, adoption in the space is this ability for, like, founders like yourself to have almost, you know, zero level of support that they need to provide. Like, once you ship it, it works, and doing it at a global scale, like, I wonder how much of the crypto adoption is just driven by that, that ability to iterate.
00:37:19.992 - 00:37:45.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I I think it's, um, probably Andre has good comments on this as well from his blogs, but I think the ability to ship something and then it kind of just runs is really cool. You cut out a lot of that maintenance, overhead, time, DevOps, backends, all this kind of stuff, which is just an impediment to growth.
00:37:45.072 - 00:37:45.352, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:45.408 - 00:38:07.816, Speaker B: So if you can just get something out there, okay, it's something to build upon. Ship it, it's done. Build the next one. You know, iterate on it. I think that's a good strategy for, like, smaller teams. Like, for us, we're only three people, right? So we can't be building everything on day one. So especially for smaller teams, if you can reduce the workload, that's a good idea.
00:38:07.920 - 00:38:20.294, Speaker A: And this has never, I think, existed for finance, for money, right? Like, I think all the previous cycles of innovation and finance were driven by much bigger firms like banks.
00:38:20.334 - 00:38:20.534, Speaker B: Right?
00:38:20.574 - 00:38:31.102, Speaker A: Like, they came out of, like, traditional firms with some innovative people there. But this startup engine is pretty cool to see it in a new space.
00:38:31.238 - 00:39:03.778, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, usually you can't iterate fast in the finance world because, like, the legacy systems are just massive impediments, right? So even if you're, oh, cool, I'm some fintech app, and my app can do all of this cool stuff. Okay, well, you can't actually do that cool stuff because in order to really do anything, you need a banking license, by the way, that's $50 million. By the way. It takes two years to get by the way. It depends on the different countries and all these different arcane systems. So yeah, massive impediment. And it means that the only people that can really play in that space are the incumbents.
00:39:03.778 - 00:39:34.414, Speaker B: And what's their incentive? Like, they own the infrastructure, why would they bother doing anything else in the remains world? Like western union owns 180 countries or 200 countries for cash outs, why would they bother building something different? They're the only game in town. So I think in the DeFi world you can just iterate way faster because you don't have any of these problems. And yeah, there's no people that are just these gatekeepers which are just annoying and horrible to work with.
00:39:34.514 - 00:39:43.274, Speaker A: If we could just do this for like healthcare and education, man, the world would just like the entire world would go to the moon.
00:39:45.174 - 00:40:33.230, Speaker B: I think Khan Academy is the future, right? Like why do, why do people need to spend so much money? Like going to a school. Like you go to a school and it's maybe you, probably your particular school and your particular geography probably statistically doesn't have the best teachers in the world, right? So why don't you use a system that selects for the best and then displays that to people and then that's your education system. So yeah, I really appreciate what's going on with Khan Academy. I think that's the way to scale that whole old world because, yeah, I mean everyone going to a school for twelve years and sitting in a classroom and everyone looking at the front and there's a whiteboard and you write stuff in a pen and paper, that's 200 years old system. It was made in Prussia for prussian soldiers, you know, to essentially help the state to, you know, enforce.
00:40:33.302 - 00:40:34.190, Speaker A: Look what happens to them.
00:40:34.222 - 00:40:41.470, Speaker B: Solidarity. Yeah. What happened to them. Yeah, yeah. So there's got to be a better way.
00:40:41.542 - 00:40:52.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree that. And like healthcare, like, it's just so frustrating how terrible it is. Like, and you know, especially over the last year, you saw it just fail all over the world.
00:40:53.294 - 00:41:31.484, Speaker B: Yeah, I think some places like the easier you can make it, the better. You know, in my time in Hong Kong, Hong Kong has a very good health system. Private too, where there's like 86 insurers in a geography of about seven, 8 million people. So. And that's because to get an insurance license is fairly easy and for an individual person you can get like elite coverage for like $1,500 for male mid twenties in a fairly high risk category. So I mean that's pretty good, right? When you compare that to what governments sort of charge. And why is that? Well, because a lot of people can innovate.
00:41:31.484 - 00:41:59.954, Speaker B: They can go and build stuff. Like, there's 86 different, you know, licenses that you can or people that have a license that can go and build stuff. So, yeah, I think it's kind of like this. If you get more people building on it, you get the network effects. Right? And we see that in crypto where the more people building on things, they can build on top of each other, they can borrow from each other. But if you have systems like legacy finance where there's just like one guy who's running it, that's just going to be bad. Yeah.
00:42:00.414 - 00:42:48.274, Speaker A: Oh, man. If somebody is like, ambitious enough to do like a self insured pool model during this hackathon, where you just like, get 10 million people around the world to, like, pay for each other's healthcare, that would be so awesome. That would blow my mind. I find that during Defi summer, you saw this explosion of tokens and ethereum. 99% of them were outright scams. But the really cool part about it was this massive formation of capital and social networks and humans around the world around this idea. If you can pull that off with something useful like healthcare, I think that could really revolutionize how that industry behaves.
00:42:48.274 - 00:42:54.186, Speaker A: But it's tough, right? Like, you need like a thousand founders to try it for one of them to succeed.
00:42:54.370 - 00:42:56.626, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
00:42:56.810 - 00:43:21.224, Speaker A: Well, pleasure talking to you, George. I mean, you're like one of the, like, in my mind, it's always like finding those founders that are willing to eat glass for like a couple years to, like, build a product that's the hardest part in the space, and we're lucky to have you. It sounds like you've eaten some glass. Building remittance business before. You kind of know how much work it takes to build a successful company.
00:43:22.004 - 00:43:56.414, Speaker B: Yeah. Done the rounds. No, I'm super pumped to be where we're at at the moment and just working with cool people as well. And you can just talk to people that are just frog images on the Internet and that's all it needs to be. Like, you don't need to focus on all these other stuff and work contracts and blah, blah, blah. It's like anyone can contribute from anywhere in the world that has a cool idea and you can put it forth and hey, maybe it gets implemented or you can go and implement it yourself. So, yeah, just the ability to work with cool people.
00:43:56.414 - 00:44:00.898, Speaker B: I really appreciate this time around. It's a lot of fun.
00:44:00.986 - 00:44:03.734, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, same all right. Thank you so much.
