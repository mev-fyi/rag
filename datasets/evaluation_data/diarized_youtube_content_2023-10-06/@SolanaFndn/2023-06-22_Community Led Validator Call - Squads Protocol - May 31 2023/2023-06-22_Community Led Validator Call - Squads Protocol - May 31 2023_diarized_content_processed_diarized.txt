00:00:00.440 - 00:00:50.160, Speaker A: So for those who don't know who I am, I'm Thomas from squads. I'm leading roles and content there. And Bastian, who's here, is our developer lead. And yeah, the idea of having me here was basically to present you the feature we built at squad to basically allow you to manage the retro authority offshore validator with the multisig. Maybe a quick recap before we go into the matter. So, I mean, I'm sure most of you know, like the restore authority, how it works, but just I think quick recap around it can be great. So basically, this key acts as a master key.
00:00:50.160 - 00:01:47.060, Speaker A: It can allows control over the most valuable assets of your validator. So it can be the restoring the reward, changing the commission rate, and as well as the validator identity. And right now, most setups of validator is pretty basic. So most validators simply use a simple key, like a ledger or Cli wallet. And this is not the most optimal setup for most evaluation, especially for teams, because it brings several issues. The biggest one is basically you give all the decision making power to some, to one key, one people, and thus it's easier for unauthorized actions to happen. So let's say you're two guys managing a validator.
00:01:47.060 - 00:02:58.644, Speaker A: It means if you're using a ledger, one person will be able to trigger bad actions like withdrawing the rewards without noticing you, which can be quite difficult for collective management. And on the other hand, the biggest issue with using only one key is basically that it can get compromised pretty easily. And as soon as the trace is now, your assets are compromised and you cannot go back. So it's quite not the most optimal setup to manage the withdrawal authority. And as I've said, it's quite, quite important to secure it in a good environment because you don't want your validator to be affected by maybe your co founder who wants to do a bad action, or just because you got malicious malware in your computer or whatever. So that's where basically multisig comes into play. If you don't mind, I can share quickly.
00:02:58.644 - 00:03:52.826, Speaker A: Give me one sec. Just a graph about multisig. I think it can be easier just to illustrate how it works. So, for those who don't know what a multisig is, it's basically a special program that holds assets on chain, and it's governed by multiple private keys instead of one single key or sq phrase. So when you create the multi seq, you add several owners to it and you set the threshold to execute transactions. So every time you want to perform a transaction for moving the assets held within it, you need the threshold to be reached. So that brings additional value for you to manage the assets like the withdrawal authority key.
00:03:52.826 - 00:04:34.462, Speaker A: And it can manage any unchained assets, basically. So multisig can manage treasury assets like SPl tokens like USDC, SoL and so on, but also authority keys. So if you are deFi protocol, you can manage the program authority there. If you have a token, you can manage the token mint authority. And for validator, you can manage your withdrawal authority with it, basically. And it allows you to split the control over your withdrawal authority to several stakeholders. So if you, you are three people managing your validator, you can basically add three keys or four.
00:04:34.462 - 00:05:34.044, Speaker A: It depends on what setup you want, but the idea is basically to split the ownership, the control of the withdrawal authority among multiple people. So every time you want to perform an action, let's say you want to change the commission, you want to restore the rewards, it will trigger a proposal and basically it will require multiple people to sign until the threshold is reached. So that allows you basically to prevent unauthorized actions on it. And although let's say one of the key of the multi seq is compromised, it doesn't affect at all your restaurant authority, and you can easily remove it with the other key of the multisig. So that's basically what we built at squad. So I have actually presentation for it. Give me just 1 second.
00:05:34.044 - 00:06:44.178, Speaker A: So that's basically what we built at squad. So not only for the rest of the key, but basically an interface to create multi seqs and then manage on chain assets like the Withdrawal authority key. And then from there you can do, you can benefit from all the advantages I mentioned before. So collective management, splitting the ownership of the withdrawal Authority, and basically since you also manage to restore authority from MLT SIG, you can restore the rewards directly to it and also store your revenue in a secure place, basically. And on top of that, we made everything to make sure that it's the safest multisig on Solana. So the biggest one, I think is the immutability part. So we burnt the authority key of the multi seq, of the squad's multi seq program.
00:06:44.178 - 00:07:31.634, Speaker A: That means besides do, besides you, no one can access or move your restore authority key or your assets that are held within your multi seq. So you're the true owner of it. The code is also open source. It has been audited multiple times by Autosig Neodym, and you can basically check the logic behind it. And it's right now, I think the most used Multisig, Antonio. I mean, all the biggest projects right now are using it. Jupiter, radium, drift, Camino, jitto, Soland, ellipsis, example.
00:07:31.634 - 00:07:48.284, Speaker A: Quite a lot. And, and that's, that's pretty much all that. Although I mentioned a lot that Multisig is mainly adapted to teams and so on. Yeah, wanted to add something.
00:07:48.744 - 00:08:16.888, Speaker B: I just wanted to ask a question while you're in this section. So let's say the squad's website went down or died. Is there tooling that I could use to do signing without having to go through any website? Maybe doing it from the command line in some way that allows multiple, you know, participants to sign a squads based multisig without just because what if, what if there's a, you know, your website goes offline and suddenly I need to do something critical and I can't do it? So can you address that?
00:08:17.056 - 00:08:21.840, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, best I can jump on this one, I think you. Yeah, sure. Yeah.
00:08:21.872 - 00:08:52.468, Speaker C: Right now we got a CLi tool. I can send a link if you want. It's open source on GitHub and we got an SDK. Right now, the CLI is pretty basic, so you will be able to do the basic function. You can execute transaction, you can vote on it, you can move mostly everything. The goal would be to have more action possible from the CLI, but yeah, with the CLI SDK, if your website goes out for some reason, you can still access it. So if you go a bit deep inside the CLI, you can add whatever you want inside.
00:08:52.468 - 00:09:09.824, Speaker C: And so you will be able to recreate mostly every function you need. And we, as the SDK rhino, you can do mostly anything. Like, I know alias is like nearly not using the UI. They only use the SDK to generate everything. So you, you can, clearly, I can send you the link for both if you want to try now.
00:09:13.044 - 00:09:54.896, Speaker A: Awesome. And yeah, lastly, I also wanted to mention that it's true that it's mostly built for teams and organizations, but it also works for single operators, because the idea behind. Okay, wait a sec, I'm gonna answer the question in the chat just after. Yeah, basically the idea with a multi seq is to reduce the risk that will happen by using only one solution, like a hardware wallet. So you don't want to rely on one single entity, one single key for the security of your business.
00:09:54.960 - 00:09:55.658, Speaker C: Basically.
00:09:55.816 - 00:10:50.942, Speaker A: And let's say you use only one hardware wallet to hold this key. If for whatever reasons, something happened to it, like a malicious upgrade is pushed and it affects your assets, you cannot go back. It's too late. Well, if you have a multi seq, you can reduce those risks by basically adding two hardware wallets from different brands. And this means even if one key gets compromised, something like the brand fucked up for some reason, it's not a big deal for you because you've already split your ownership with another brand. And even though, let's say we take what happened with Ledger, to be honest, I think it's fine. I will trust Ledger.
00:10:50.942 - 00:11:46.504, Speaker A: But again, we are in crypto and you never know. So if you want the highest level of security for your withdrawal authority key, that's something you can consider and that some validators are doing, like Michael from Lane did it, for instance, last week. So really, Multisig is not only about only for teams and organizations, but also for individual single operators. If you want the highest level of security for it, it will for sure add some complexity. Every time you want to withdraw, the rewards, change the commission. You'll have to use two keys, but at the end, it's a trade off. For better safety, I can maybe quickly show you the interface of the app so you can see how it looks.
00:11:46.504 - 00:12:13.124, Speaker A: Just one sec. Basically, from the squads interface, you can go under. Developers click on validators and azure validators from it. So add the name, the identity.
00:12:15.064 - 00:12:15.376, Speaker D: And.
00:12:15.400 - 00:13:00.430, Speaker A: Then the key pair, and basically delegate the restaurant key to your squad. And once it's done, you'd be able to manage. So we'll see. Not here, but I can go back. But basically from here, you'd be able to manage the commission rate, withdraw the rewards, or if for whatever reason, you want to go back and transfer the restore authority key to your previous wallet, you can do it from the squad interface again. And from there you can restore the rewards to it. So it also adds all the advantages of multi seq.
00:13:00.430 - 00:13:23.606, Speaker A: So you'd be able to manage the sol. You can also, if you're in the US off ramp with our conflow integration, directly within your bank account. So that's also something nice. But yeah, the main. The main goal here is to present the validator feature. So, yeah, that's. That's pretty much all about it.
00:13:23.606 - 00:14:12.234, Speaker A: So I'm curious to know your thoughts, questions on this. And, yeah, really don't hesitate to be vocal on this. Like, if you think that something is missing, that for whatever reason, sucks, I'd love to know why. I truly believe that it adds, like, benefits for you, for your operations as a validator. So unless maybe you're in the single operator and you're using the vamp program for Zante two, I think like having a multi seq for managing the rest of the key makes a lot of sense. Can maybe check the chat quickly?
00:14:13.374 - 00:14:25.054, Speaker D: Yeah, I wanted to go into the CLI a little bit deeper. So right now with the CLI, are you able to establish the multisig and manage it or only manage it?
00:14:28.834 - 00:14:31.334, Speaker A: Hassan, you want to jump on this one?
00:14:32.874 - 00:14:54.744, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good question, because didn't use it lately. I think we get a possibility to create from. But shall we get a look? And if it's not the case, I will have the functionality because it's not really too complex to add it right now. I think it permits you to create it and manage. Let me run it. I must have it on my computer.
00:14:56.604 - 00:15:01.064, Speaker D: Okay. And then. But at a minimum, with the CLI, could you pass back?
00:15:02.364 - 00:15:04.904, Speaker C: So, yeah, you can create a difference.
00:15:06.684 - 00:15:23.124, Speaker D: And then at a minimum, as Ann said, let's say the website's down. So could you pass. So could you sign transactions using the CLI or at least pass the authority back to the original wallet using the CLI in terms of recovery options?
00:15:25.304 - 00:16:04.444, Speaker C: So, yeah, you can sign and do proposal execution from the CLI. Right now for the veil part, we don't have the viaductor functionality in the CLI. So technically, if you want to get it out, you need to be able to craft yourself the transaction and use maybe more DSDK rather than the CLI. But if this is the kind of usage you can have, we can clearly have it. Maybe like during, I don't know, for this week, but maybe next week we can have the basic functionality. So you can at least do the move back with rotority to something else. So that will permit you to be able, at least if something go really wrong to get it back from the CLI here.
00:16:04.824 - 00:16:08.294, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. Just some type of fallback mechanism, I think would be helpful.
00:16:08.334 - 00:16:09.074, Speaker C: Yeah, sure.
00:16:09.894 - 00:16:15.794, Speaker D: And then being able to do it from whatever hardware wallets you support, I guess, as well.
00:16:19.294 - 00:16:49.724, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Brian asked if squad charge a fee in the interface. Not at all. So everything is free. The only thing that you pay is the gas fees, but to delegate, to restore authority, to withdraw the commissions, to do any operation within squads, you don't pay any additional fees. Again, the gas fees.
00:16:49.724 - 00:17:29.652, Speaker A: But to be honest, we are working on a new version of squads. So V four. So V three won't change. It's immutable. We cannot do any change to it. But we're working on a new, a version of squad and that will include a subscription model where we will be able to charge some for some features, but the basic features won't be included in this. So that means the validator part, as soon as you don't have like ten restaurant authority keys, it should be fine.
00:17:29.652 - 00:18:10.104, Speaker A: You won't pay anything. It's only for really power users that use quad a lot for multiple programs. Treasury and the idea is also to add integrations within squad and to basically have some sort of partnerships with integrated protocol. So for instance, you're able to use Soland site options realms within squat, so you can use remotely seek to interact with DeFi protocols. And we want to offer more of that. And in that case, we'll take a fee on that. But again, it won't change your experience at all.
00:18:10.104 - 00:18:36.060, Speaker A: And our goal is really to offer the best experience for managing on channel assets on Solana. And so we don't want to charge for basic stuff. Michael asked at Breakpoint, you showed a dedicated value data management CLI. Is that not available anymore? I wasn't there at that time. So maybe Bastian, you can answer this one.
00:18:36.252 - 00:19:13.586, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it was the Bayed one. Bayed was only made at the moment to be imageable and so permitted, but it's not the same CLI tool as the actual v three one that became immutable later. But if some of the functionalities were already here in Bayes, I can probably just copy fast. Right now I'm just preparing my ticket so I don't know where I can ping you guys when the functionalities are out for the CLI and if you want to communicate. But yeah, we'll have it pretty soon on this and I will see what we can extract from Bayes to have it on the new CLI. If you want to migrate on the.
00:19:13.610 - 00:19:46.514, Speaker A: Three year, I think we can ping you on the Selenada discord channel if that works for you guys. Yeah, we'll keep you posted on this. Any other thoughts, questions? Is there someone who thinks that's great at all? Just curious just to hear some thoughts on this.
00:19:49.654 - 00:20:06.434, Speaker E: Well, I can just add on my side that last week I migrated my validator to using a squads multisig, so I don't have much to add, but basically to say that it works, which I think is the main thing.
00:20:07.694 - 00:20:08.894, Speaker A: Oh, Michael.
00:20:08.974 - 00:20:55.616, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the main concern is also not like, you know, a lack of trust in ledger or anything like that, but validators obviously want to protect their withdrawal authority. It's the most valuable key. And if you use a hardware wallet, you still have that seat backed up somewhere, right? On a piece of paper maybe two pieces of paper. So it's still a singular kind of point of failure if that gets in the wrong hands. So in my case, I just used squads to basically set up two hardware wallets. So even if a single seat is compromised, it doesn't affect the validator. So that's my approach here.
00:20:55.640 - 00:21:14.930, Speaker B: Just to add to that. I mean, you can, with the hardware wallet, do something kind of cheesy that's similar. My hardware, I have it on paper, but I split the paper into five papers and they're in five places. So it's like you can't get them all unless you get all five papers. But, you know, that's just a cheesy way to accomplish something somewhat similar, in a sense. You can do that.
00:21:15.082 - 00:21:38.580, Speaker E: Well, one of my hardware wallets is actually split up with a Xiaomiya secret thing into three. So it is kind of both. So it's two hardware wallets which are further subdivided. But yeah, obviously you can absolutely do that. It's just an additional layer of security. But it works is the point I want to do.
00:21:38.652 - 00:22:02.354, Speaker B: Yeah, my point is not to say that it's not. There are all bad ways to do it, it's just that there's not one way to do it. There are many ways to do these things, and everyone's going to have to choose the way they find best works best for them. I think the squad thing is awesome. And because it's so well designed and sort of, you know, there's a whole team behind creating usability. And I think that's very, very valuable. And I think people who want multisig, this is a great solution for that.
00:22:03.774 - 00:22:27.764, Speaker A: Thanks. Thanks, Prashet. All right, I think no one has any more. Any question? Yeah, branch to. Yeah, yeah, just 1 second, Chris. Brian, just to under fees. Yeah, we need a sustainable business model for sure.
00:22:27.764 - 00:23:11.824, Speaker A: That's on our roadmap. But I don't think it makes much more sense to charge for like transaction fees, like every time you do an action within squad. So the goal is more like to offer higher features. And if you want like better customer support, if you want really to use at max capacity squads, then you can take a subscription for it. And also to basically bring value within the squads platform and with partners or other protocols. Let's say, for instance, you want to stake your soul, you want to land your soul. I don't know.
00:23:11.824 - 00:23:35.404, Speaker A: You want to provide liquidity for your token share defi protocol. That's something valuable for teams to offer that. And we can take a fee by working with those partners. So that's the idea. And it doesn't like affect your experience at all because we really want, we don't want to add frictions with those fees and so on. Yep, that all sounds great. Looks good.
00:23:37.044 - 00:23:37.444, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:37.484 - 00:23:40.064, Speaker A: Chris, you wanted to touch something?
00:23:40.844 - 00:23:48.864, Speaker D: Yeah. Which hardware wallets do you support? Is it dependent on a wallet that connects to your interface or is it integrated directly?
00:23:49.644 - 00:23:51.104, Speaker A: Which wallet we support?
00:23:51.524 - 00:23:53.784, Speaker D: No, I'm sorry. Which hardware wallet do you support?
00:23:54.564 - 00:24:01.612, Speaker A: Ledger Keystone, one key. So the biggest ones, yeah, we are.
00:24:01.628 - 00:24:35.324, Speaker C: Following the wallet standalone. So right now if something is going widest on our, it will be already detected. We got mostly all the big adapters. I think the only native adapter right now on other wallets is only ledger, I guess. But if you use Phantom backpack or whatever that do a bridge, everything will work, I guess, if it's implemented. But if there is new order wallet that goes something like ledger with their own adapter, we can add it pretty fast. And if it's following the new standard made by Jordan, it will go right in without us doing any change.
00:24:36.064 - 00:25:03.924, Speaker A: For Keystone, for instance, you can use software, so the software extension and for one key you can use wallet connect. So those are the biggest ones on Solana, I think. And they are all compatible with squads. You just need either to use hot wallet or the wallet connector extension.
00:25:06.704 - 00:25:07.444, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:25:11.144 - 00:25:31.974, Speaker A: Awesome. I think. I think we don't have any more questions. Thanks guys. It was a pleasure to present the whole feature. And again, if you have any questions, you need any assistance or whatever, just ping me or drop me a message and we'll help you. With pleasure.
00:25:32.354 - 00:25:49.134, Speaker D: Thanks guys. Going to drop your discord ids in the chat? Yeah, thanks. All right, so Zach, you want to give a brief introduction to that? I guess.
00:25:52.284 - 00:26:28.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll keep it really, because it's already been presented a couple times. I'll just drop a real quick link in the chat to the GitHub repo that has a lot of documentation. There was already a video that I made in one of the validator meetings where I described it. So you can go read that if you want, go watch that if you want that kind of description. But you know, it, it's the opposite of what, you know, what squads is doing. It's no well designed UI. It's the simplest possible thing.
00:26:28.794 - 00:27:03.082, Speaker B: And it's really just what I think the vote account should have been structured as to provide, you know, a separate set of keys to control different aspects instead of having essentially one key rule everything. And so it's the smallest possible layer around the regular vote account program. It's been audited. It's written in very simple code. It's a very small program. It's non upgradable. I did everything I could think of to make it as much of this most minor incremental addition to the regular vote account program as possible.
00:27:03.082 - 00:27:30.866, Speaker B: And it just provides you to split your. Instead of going wide, like squads would do, where you have multiple people having, you know, control over one key, it goes deep. It has five keys instead of one key so that you can. And it separates the actions that each of those keys can take so that you can more directly control the level of exposure that you want for each of those keys according to, you know, what you're going to do with that key. It's totally optional. I'm not even pressing anyone to use it. Use it if you want, don't use it if you don't want.
00:27:30.866 - 00:28:02.108, Speaker B: I don't even care. I use it because I hope you all eventually have commission and can earn, you know, vote rewards. But when you do, you'll find that it's a bit of a pain to, like, move those around. So I have automated scripting that runs every day that just rebalances my accounts, and you can't do that if you have to have a human in the process, like doing the signing. So I have. My withdrawal is actually controlled by a key. They can do nothing else except withdraw, and it's stored in a place where it can run in a script daily in a fairly safe place.
00:28:02.108 - 00:29:06.168, Speaker B: And if that gets lost, then all that or gets compromised, that the worst that can happen is someone can get one day's worth of rewards that haven't been taken since the previous day, which would suck, but it's not the biggest deal in the world, and I would just replace that key. Since the way that vamp works is with a hierarchy of authorities, I can just replace that key using one of the authorities I already have and keep in a safer location. Yeah. So then, in terms of squads, I talked already with Thomas about this, and what it could add to squads is if, you know, it can add the deepness while still allowing the wideness. So you could, if it was integrated into squads, then you could use it to set up your vote account such that you had multiple keys that you could then have multiple signing authorities for. So you could, if you had a really complex organization, have one group of people that are responsible for having authority over withdrawing, doing nothing other than withdrawing rewards or rebalancing accounts and other people that have authority over other actions and you could maybe use a different squads, multisig for those people. But honestly, we're getting into pretty esoteric use cases, and I don't know that anyone's ever even going to do that.
00:29:06.168 - 00:29:52.172, Speaker B: But the other thing that vamp does is it, as someone said, it would be really cool if we had a way to limit commissions in addition. So it has a feature where voluntarily, you can choose to set a limit on your commission so that you cannot change it except, you know, within the limits that you've set. And that may be useful to some people because they may want to give promises to stakers about commission that they want to be able to put some, you know, bite behind instead of just making a promise that they made. As we've seen people break those promises all the time. They don't mean anything, really, but this will actually allow that promise to mean something if you really want it to. I personally am against commission promises, so I don't even think that's something people should be doing. But if you're going to do it, this at least a allows you to have some weight behind that promise.
00:29:52.172 - 00:30:26.964, Speaker B: The only thing I'll add is that it's possible that the delegation program may want to use vamp, and we've had some discussions about it just as a way to protect themselves from, you know, getting rug pulled on commission. But that's not relevant to anyone. That's not the delegation program because that's going to be their, you know, they're going to drive that requirement if they want it. So anyway, I gave the link to vamp, and if you want to read more about it, I'm always happy to answer questions about it. Just think of it as the most minimal possible addition to the vote account program to give what I think should have been the original structuring of the keys within that program.
00:30:27.984 - 00:30:28.884, Speaker A: That's all.
00:30:33.184 - 00:30:39.884, Speaker D: Right. Thanks. Does anybody have any questions on that? If not, we'll move on to the pr discussion.
00:30:40.784 - 00:30:42.484, Speaker A: Should I stop recording now or.
00:30:45.244 - 00:30:50.044, Speaker D: So did you say stop or. Sorry? Yeah, stop. Oh, yeah, stop.
