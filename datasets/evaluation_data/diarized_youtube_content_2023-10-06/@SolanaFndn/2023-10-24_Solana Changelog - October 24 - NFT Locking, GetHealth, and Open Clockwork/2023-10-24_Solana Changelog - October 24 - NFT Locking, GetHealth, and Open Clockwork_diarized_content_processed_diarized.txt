00:00:03.840 - 00:00:35.792, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Welcome to this week's Changelog, where we go over the changes week by week that happen on Solana. My name is Jacob and I'm joined by Jonas. And just as a heads up, breakpoints are just around the corner. So if you are a developer and want to get one of those discounted tickets, make sure you apply for a developer ticket on the Solana.com breakpoint. The tickets are available up until October 25 for that discounted rate, so don't miss out on applying for a dev ticket if you are a dev.
00:00:35.792 - 00:01:10.504, Speaker A: And then next up we have the core community call. So last week we had the core community call on feature gates and the future of future gates within a multi client world. Joe Caulfield should have presented on that. So if you're interested in reviewing that, if you missed actually watching it, you can go on to the YouTube channel for Solana foundation or go to the core community call repo in order to view that call. And then the hackathon just ended a few weeks ago. And Jonas, do you wanted to talk about that a little bit? Yeah.
00:01:10.544 - 00:01:36.044, Speaker B: So the hackathon has ended and the winners will be announced, actually at breakpoint. So I can't wait to meet you all there. And if you want to look a little bit of the projects that have been made, there are, there are some really great projects in there. Chase actually made a thread about it and there are, I think, over 150 projects who replied to this thread, and you can just scroll through them and have a look at them. So it's very interesting.
00:01:36.204 - 00:02:22.764, Speaker A: Yeah. And another thing is that if you haven't announced your project on social media, Twitter or whatever, make sure you do marketing is half the battle. Getting your project well known is half the battle on winning these hackathons, because you have to not only create the product, but then have that go to market strategy to where you get the users on your project. So definitely reply to chase on here. Go talk about your project on Twitter and any other social media that you may use. Our commit of the week is this commit by Stevie about changing the githealth endpoint to compare optimistically confirmed slots. So previously it was kind of like coarse to use githealth and it didn't really, it wasn't exactly super reliable.
00:02:22.764 - 00:02:53.104, Speaker A: This one kind of uses the optimistically confirmed slots instead that you kind of pull from gossip, which makes it a lot more reliable. And it kind of removes or diminishing the slots behind value on like a process restart. So you can see here, it's like a really cool change, because even Michael Vines was like, hey, this actually works. Definitely look into the change if you're interested in how exactly it changed git health for the better.
00:02:53.404 - 00:03:24.494, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds very interesting. Another thing that we found is that clockwork, as you may have known, turned down their maintenance of the clockwork SDK recently. But there's now an open clockwork branch and there are a few people from super team Vietnam who took it over and now working on it. So if you're interested in keeping this alive, you can just go in there and contribute and we can all work together to keep it alive and that everyone can do on chain automation. Again, cool.
00:03:24.534 - 00:03:31.154, Speaker A: And I know you use clockwork for a lot of your game examples, right? Like what are some of the different ways that you've used it in the past?
00:03:32.054 - 00:03:58.834, Speaker B: Yeah. So for example, our game example, Solana 2048, uses it to pay out revolts every Sunday automatically to the first three players. And the other game that we built, the other example, the seven Seas game, you can actually, on the sea, you can turn on the wind, and then it moves all the ships automatically every 2 seconds. So there's actually a lot of use cases for games. So I would love to see it live on.
00:03:59.734 - 00:04:19.044, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, it would be really cool if anybody wants or is interested in joining the open clockwork initiative to go reach out. I think it's tuan on Twitter, or you can just reach out to them on GitHub as well. So it's another cool open source project.
00:04:19.464 - 00:04:31.644, Speaker B: And if you need like a quick replacement, for example, for now, probably you need to fall back to some script, or you can use trigger for example, or switchboard functions. So I think they all also have some kind of automation functionality.
00:04:32.024 - 00:05:24.724, Speaker A: Cool. And then another resource that we wanted to highlight is Armani and the backpack team made a change that kind of locks your collections within your wallet. Now it's a wallet only feature. So if you do something outside of the wallet, it does not affect you or does not actually lock the nfTs. But the way that it works is quite literally only possible in Solana. As Armani says in his tweet, it's actually really cool and how simple it is that what he did, so that it would lock the mad lags within your wallet. So basically, whenever you make a transaction, you have a list of writable accounts, right? If the writable account is a NFT and the wallet that you have on your UI side is saying that you locked it, it will prevent you from actually using that transaction.
00:05:24.724 - 00:05:45.984, Speaker A: So this kind of, like, it's a very simple change, but it's a very powerful change based off of just the Ui, you can lock the accounts and prevent you from accidentally draining your mad lads or even other things within your wallet because you have locked it. So it's a cool but simple change.
00:05:46.804 - 00:06:01.052, Speaker B: Yeah. I love it. It's such an easy idea and it was such a big impact. It's really, really cool. Yeah, everybody, I think that's already it. I can't wait to see everyone at breakpoint. If you don't have a ticket yet, don't forget to buy your tickets in time.
00:06:01.052 - 00:06:10.724, Speaker B: There's currently the. The late early birds tickets available and. Yeah. See you, everyone in. I think it's only two weeks. Bye bye.
00:06:10.884 - 00:06:11.564, Speaker A: All right, bye.
