00:00:12.600 - 00:00:22.942, Speaker A: Hey, folks, this is Anatoly, and you're listening to the Solana podcast. And today I have Dan Gansberg with me, who is the CEO, co founder of the Hero Network. Awesome to have you.
00:00:22.998 - 00:00:25.530, Speaker B: Thanks, Tully. It's great to be here. Happy to be here with you today.
00:00:25.662 - 00:00:31.714, Speaker A: Awesome. Would you want to kind of talk about how you got into crypto and what Hero network is all about?
00:00:31.794 - 00:01:07.174, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So my background has largely been in derivatives trading. I started my career on the floor of the Chicago board of Trade during my summers home from school when I was 18. And right out of college, I started trading us treasury bonds at first. And then a couple years later, I got into kind of like, I guess, the third or fourth inning of the Internet boom when tech stocks were really starting to roll. And so I started trading tech stocks. It actually got me off the trading floor and did that for a number of years, eventually worked my way back to futures.
00:01:07.174 - 00:01:41.220, Speaker B: I started actually trading the short end of the yield curve and then all the way up to, like, 2011. I joined a proprietary trading firm that two of my friends had co founded and eventually ended up becoming the chief operating officer there. And while I was there, 2015, Bitcoin had a lot of what seemed to be upside optionality. It had gone. It was coming out the back end of the bear market, I think started in early 2014. I thought there was good optionality in it. It started buying some bitcoin and sent me down the rabbit hole.
00:01:41.220 - 00:02:32.624, Speaker B: And by 2017, I was all in on crypto and ended up parting ways with the firm. And in 2018, my now partner, a guy who, he was running an agricultural options market making desk at our firm, he left a few months later and then joined me. We started trading together, trading crypto together. And while we were trading, we ended up conceptualizing hero. And really, the idea was to just find a more simplified, little bit more fun way of interacting with the market and trading. And a lot of it came from seeing a lot of retail traders make their way. Everyone was finding their way to BitMex and without too much experience over levering and rinsing the remaining crypto that they had left.
00:02:32.624 - 00:03:27.088, Speaker B: And it was hard to see after a while. And so we said, hey, can we find a way that we can really balance the emotional or the financial side and the financial reward that comes with trading? Kind of introduced some of the emotional side of social and gaming and things like that, and came up with this idea to build this more simplified way of trading the market, which was really a combination of a cash or nothing digital option with a paramutualized payoff to it. And that ended up becoming what is known on Hero IO as Moonwrecked. And we built that in the last half of 2018, launched it in 2019, had been building the platform ever since. So we now have. Hero IO have three specific products. One is that moon Rect, which is the paramutual, and then two products that are other light, exotic options.
00:03:27.088 - 00:04:41.894, Speaker B: One is a one touch, and one is a little bit more analogous to a vanilla option, but has some different tenants to it. Out of that, we always knew that we wanted to take the steps towards eventually progressively decentralizing the platform. And this past year, it was kind of a combination, I think, of what our view of the universe was as a whole, and kind of what was happening socially in the world. And it just seems like the time to make the transition was now. And what we had decided to do is that it kind of came out of that, and it also came out of the fact that we were on a b, two b basis. We were starting to get a lot of interest for white labeling of our existing products, and we knew there was some difficulties with that potentially around regulation and whatnot. And so it just made sense for us to say, like, well, what if we started to disintermediate this and build a network out of it? And at the center of the network, kind of lay the groundwork for in plumbing for what are these various types of derivative protocols that operators can come build on or attach as nodes to individual users can come on a web3 basis and access it very easily in a non custody way.
00:04:41.894 - 00:05:38.284, Speaker B: And kind of that with what was going on in the world at the time, and also kind of where we think the world is going, which we do think that this whole concept of networks and scaling networks, something like an exchange, I feel like exchanges, they're almost like, in the future, and you kind of look out like the world will look like in ten years or so, let's say. And you really have these networks as like pillars for different purposes. And exchanges, in my mind, almost feel like public utilities in a way, and really building the plumbing and tooling that will allow any operator or any user to come and build on top of it using these kind of unique, light, exotic protocols that we're creating, which ideally should give people a more simplistic way to interface with various types of derivatives and give them some level of optionality, no pun intended, to access the market kind of in new and creative ways.
00:05:38.364 - 00:05:56.060, Speaker A: Do you think the tech that we see for exchanges, even centralized ones like binance, FTX. Is it ahead of the, what you would find at, like, New York Stock Exchange and NYSE? Or, I mean, like, CME or are we still kind of behind? Like, is this.
00:05:56.212 - 00:07:10.584, Speaker B: I think in the, like, I think from a technology perspective, it's. It's not too much different from what I experienced in legacy markets, other than the fact that maybe, at least in crypto, that some of the exchanges aren't quite as advanced on the connectivity side. I think they're obviously doing things in the legacy world and much more higher frequency and connecting via fixed protocols or things like that, that you don't really get on a lot of the exchanges that exist in crypto today, but some of the things that I think are, that you don't get are really on the financial side. In my mind, being able to go to FTX and actually lend your assets to me is pretty amazing. And you kind of have this way of always keeping your capital working. And without this concept, without this middleman of an FCM, which is something that exists in the derivatives world and legacy world, without, like, that middleman is usually the one that's kind of keeping that spread. Or they're taking your capital and aggregating it up and then relending it or earning interest on it while you're utilizing their pipes to trade through an exchange.
00:07:10.584 - 00:07:45.992, Speaker B: Without that middleman there, that creates a lot more opportunity for market participants. And that's one thing with FTX, for example, that I love about it, is that, that a lot of that opportunity is being given back to the end user, which is something that really doesn't exist. You're generally not capturing any float on your capital when you're depositing cash, for example, to an FCM. And the fact that you can go to FTX and lend your money on an hourly basis at pretty competitive rates is really compelling. So I think that's something that really, in my mind, is pretty awesome.
00:07:46.128 - 00:07:49.444, Speaker A: Is that, like, lack of competitiveness? Like, why?
00:07:49.524 - 00:07:52.508, Speaker B: Why does it exist?
00:07:52.596 - 00:07:57.540, Speaker A: Why doesn't it exist in, like, an e trade? Like, why, why can't they learn?
00:07:57.612 - 00:08:18.618, Speaker B: Oh, because I think because that's how e trade, like, makes most of money either. You know, I actually don't have the real answer to that. But what I do know is that, like, with at least when interest rates are above zero, that one of the ways, like a futures clearing merchant, for example, makes most of their money is by taking your money and then reinvesting it, you know, much like a bank would.
00:08:18.716 - 00:08:19.158, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:19.246 - 00:09:06.008, Speaker B: And so they're capturing that float. And you have to think like, let's say you have $20 billion sitting on your books at an FCM and then like, if, you know, government paper is paying 3% and you can take the majority of that, like, all the unencumbered cash that's sitting in your books and earn 3% on, say, you know, even if it's on 10 billion, it's quite a bit of free cash that's coming back to, you know, to you as a company. And I think you're going to have to chop some hands off to get them to let that go. So I think that's why you don't get it on those markets. And if you do, it's always like, hey, we'll pay you a 0.3% annualized percentage rate on your money. But they're obviously making a much wider spread of that.
00:09:06.008 - 00:09:26.458, Speaker B: And I'm not saying that they're not doing that in legacy exchange markets and crypto or they're not going to be doing that in Defi. Now, obviously that is one of the drivers of what's going on in the whole defi space. But at least here the yields are much more competitive now or much more lucrative for the end users.
00:09:26.586 - 00:09:42.014, Speaker A: Yeah, it's rent seekers, man. I love the calling it chopping hands instead of disintermediation.
00:09:44.754 - 00:09:53.450, Speaker B: I think this intermediation is our way of approaching, which is the smart way, as opposed to the old Chicago way of your signature or your head or your blood.
00:09:53.522 - 00:10:13.794, Speaker A: Yeah, that's crazy. Like, in my mind, I think those entities that have so much to lose from adoption of crypto effectively have lost already. Yeah, because like this is just software, right? Like it is, like it's unstoppable because it is just code.
00:10:13.874 - 00:11:05.606, Speaker B: It's the coolest part about it and one of many reasons. But once it starts to really capture, feel like we're on the right side of the hockey stick at this point. And so as things scale, it just gets harder and harder. And look, you're seeing it every day. You're seeing more and more this crossover from legacy markets. And I get on the phone with a lot of, whether they're CEO's of prop firms or some of the executives from the FCMS and some of them got on it pretty early and you know, fortunately, like when I was at DV trading, like we captured, there was a guy there that had gotten into it pretty early and fortunately for all of us had brought it to everybodys attention and ive always been super grateful for that because I probably would not have really gotten into crypto probably until 2017 at the time. But it got me in early and it just got turned off by so many for so long.
00:11:05.606 - 00:11:38.580, Speaker B: And I just feel like theres going to be so many people that are going to be rushing in to try to come in late. And a lot of those legacy games that kind of strong armed kind of the smaller or the up and comer or the disrupter out of markets, I feel like just crypto as a whole, regardless of the ecosystem that you're part of, is just collectively grown much larger and kind of capture resistant at this point. It's going to be very difficult for these guys to do anything but kind of fall into line.
00:11:38.732 - 00:11:42.824, Speaker A: Yeah. Which is, I think, exciting for all the disruptors.
00:11:43.524 - 00:12:55.462, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Exactly. It's, you know, and it's one of the things that, you know, from our, like, we started very centralized and we kind of are like, in this thing where we're working backwards and, you know, and progressively decentralizing hero and that's definitely been tricky as there's not like, there's not too much by way of like playbook on how to do it correctly and definitely have surrounded ourselves with good counsel and the accounting firms and whatnot to make sure that, you know, that we're doing this in a sequenced way that allows the network and allows hero and the participants in the network to ideally, you know, eventually take this on. And, you know, we want this network to, and I say to our team, it's like, look, we're just laying the groundwork here. And we've already started to bring in a couple of groups that have experience, whether it's engineering teams, guys that have worked on Solana core, which is really exciting to be working with those guys and bringing these guys in. I say to my team all the time, we want this to outgrow us as fast as possible. And one of our measures of success is us becoming somewhat irrelevant to the network.
00:12:55.462 - 00:13:05.326, Speaker B: And we're really kind of committed to that path at this point. And I do think it's, you know, it's the future kind of how things are going to operate in the world going forward.
00:13:05.390 - 00:13:35.096, Speaker A: So, yeah, like, building networks, I think, is like, I think one of the coolest parts of this is that's so different from traditional finance, I think, in my mind, or even like, traditional startups, like, we're not building a SaaS, there isn't like, we're not trying to twist somebody's arm into a subscription. Right. You're actually trying to get them into the ecosystem and like give them stuff away for free as much as we can.
00:13:35.160 - 00:14:36.760, Speaker B: Totally. I mean, I'm sure you've experienced this as much as anybody. You talk to people that are just kind of getting their head around it, especially if they come from like, you know, a deep finance background, like over the last 20 years. They will look at you like you are absolutely crazy and you're like, wait, what? You're driving all the value of your network back to your community and your token, you're not keeping it as revenue to your company. And I was like, well, no, that's not how this works. But ultimately, when you step back and think about it, it puts you in a position to grow so much larger and so much more in such a different way that truly does capture effects of partially of what all this was set out to be in the first place. And really capturing those network effects and scaling, it's really exciting to see our community has been so supportive of it and we're just really excited to be going down this path.
00:14:36.760 - 00:14:37.364, Speaker B: Now.
00:14:37.944 - 00:14:42.392, Speaker A: I think that 90 stack firms actually get this.
00:14:42.488 - 00:14:42.942, Speaker B: Sure.
00:14:43.048 - 00:15:07.810, Speaker A: They, like, they gave everything out for free to grow as fast as they could. And there was like the shift where like those business models, like the ad based ones were basically dried up and like everything went back to subscription. You got to pay for it every month or something like that. You're trying to, like, we went from a world where everything on the Internet was free to where everybody's trying to kind of like extract their rant from you on the Internet. Totally.
00:15:07.882 - 00:15:41.834, Speaker B: It kind of went from like I was reading something, I forget who wrote it. There's a book around the community capitalism. Somebody was making a comment on it and it was really simple and just what do they say? They said from 2000 to 2010 was shareholder capitalism and then 2010 to 2020 was consumers and then 2020 forward is really community capitalism, which community capitalism in a geographic sense is somewhat analogous, but like, just in a network sense, I think it's kind of what's going to be happening here.
00:15:41.914 - 00:16:15.046, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really good way to put it. I've never heard that term before, but that's kind of interesting. I thought that the coolest thing at a Defi summer was this like rapid formation of communities, you know, around capital. Right? Like capital is a part of it. But also the only thing that really identified them was this token. As silly as yams was, there were 10,000 people that all came together around one thing.
00:16:15.150 - 00:16:50.100, Speaker B: It's so cool. And it had those effects of being a part of community and something larger than you, which is almost these maslowian things like religion. In a way. I want to be careful saying that, because I think it's when the wrong people hear that, they go, oh, of course. But we know that's not the case. We're all putting effort into a community. And I related it just like I'm jewish and obviously had ties into Israel, and there's these very socialist style communities that are called kibbutzim.
00:16:50.100 - 00:17:13.092, Speaker B: And it's effectively like these communities that live off of their land. It's all self governed, and it has whole hierarchy systems, and it's like their own cities almost, and. And for the most part, self sustaining. Right. And, like, it's so relatable. It's like so much of what we're doing are things. I mean, you always say this about everyone says about finance.
00:17:13.092 - 00:18:15.774, Speaker B: This is totally true. Like, we're not necessarily reinventing the wheel on things like yield, capture, or the different ways to, like, actually trade, but we're just, like, kind of reinventing the how and, like, the infrastructure behind it. But it's kind of, to me, is like the same thing around, like, community capitalism. And this concept of building a network where every network participant is putting forth some type of effort effectively to help the others in some way, shape or form. And being rewarded for it is like a big kibbutz. I love it kind of has those same tenets to it. And so I I've really, like, gone down that wormhole and, like, done a lot of reading around it and, and have had a, you know, it's been really fascinating, and especially me coming from, like, I came from a background and, like, you know, a lot of people that come from the trading world, and obviously, you're close with Sam, who's probably one of the most well known traders in our space and just an exceptional trader and businessman and everything.
00:18:15.774 - 00:19:00.264, Speaker B: But you come from this world, especially in prop trading, where it is very the bottom line. What determines your fate is your p and l. And that's really it. It's really just about, it sounds horrible, but it's just about making money and really being able to transfer that in a way that you can set up your ecosystem where so many people can benefit. You don't need to know who these people are for the most part. The fact that you can totally disintermediate it, and your effort in the ecosystem ties directly to your reward and setting up kind of fair schemes for that. And, man, there's just a lot to chew on and there's a lot for us to be building, so.
00:19:00.264 - 00:19:01.676, Speaker B: Super excited.
00:19:01.820 - 00:19:12.614, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, same. I love the kibbutz analogy. There's a bunch of them, right? So, like, switching from the Ethereum kiboots to the solana kiboots.
00:19:16.434 - 00:19:30.174, Speaker B: Totally, totally. They all have their own flavor, right? One. One lives off of, one lives off of a certain type of potato, the other, like, bases everything they do, and, like, a green, leafy lettuce. Very, very defi summer ish.
00:19:32.114 - 00:19:33.414, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
00:19:34.254 - 00:20:09.554, Speaker B: That's funny. I think we're headed into a really exciting direction. And you also have this thing with everything that's gone on the last couple years, even socially, it all just, like, as bad as so many things happen, it just was like a signal to the world that things needed to change. And I think what we're doing at crypto is both socially and financially, and just everything is. We're really just kind of reinventing how. How things are going to work. And I find it hard to, you know, as you said before, it's, uh, it's kind of past that point of no return.
00:20:09.554 - 00:20:18.110, Speaker B: How it fully integrates and how it plays out, I don't think any of us can, you know, going to be able to predict it 100%. Right. But I think we're all positioning it fairly well.
00:20:18.182 - 00:20:27.834, Speaker A: Is it, like, development for these products, like, these financial products? Is it harder on for, like, an open network versus an exchange?
00:20:28.234 - 00:21:45.900, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, it's definitely different. I think the first thing you have to remind yourself is that you can't always just go back and do a hotfix once you're on chain. If things go haywire, that's definitely not good. But really trying to think about it in the context of the tenants of the product and how do you build it in a way that if you have some limitations or some kind of fence around what you can or can't do with it, it's kind of in this place right now where I think even building on Solana, almost everything we're doing is around the token, obviously, and not the hero token, but just tokenizing different aspects of the products that we're building. And that, to me, is something like, okay, half the engineers are just building on it, moving fast, and the other half are like, how can we make this even more efficient? Like, what can we do with this to make it even better? And I think that's kind of pretty cool. And I think one of the things of, like, building to it, to a network like Solana, too, is that fact that it is kind of open sourced and, you know, for the most part. And the fact that our team comes up with a certain way to look at things, it maybe changes the course of how new projects come on Solana and build as well.
00:21:45.900 - 00:22:44.184, Speaker B: And, you know, I think that's pretty neat. And the, you know, just in terms of building the products again, yeah, it's going back to like, the building and legacy. I think it's probably easier to build certain aspects of it. But I definitely think some of the, like, it's really, when you kind of get down to like the granular items and like, can I create something that has, is pretty much apples to apples, like to what I would deliver centrally? And, you know, part of that is probably what exists in the ecosystem today. What can we compose with that are tools to help us make our product more commercially viable or like the products that are being built on our network more commercially viable. And like, you kind of have some of those, those elements that depending on the ecosystem you're in really work. But, yeah, I don't know if I gave a good answer there, but definitely, definitely has upsides and challenges.
00:22:44.564 - 00:23:28.152, Speaker A: Yeah, the hotfix thing is like a hard problem. And like, you know, we have support where you can actually, like at the loader level, make the program upgradable and go change the bytecode. But yeah, the challenge there is that, like, how do you tie that into governance, right. If you, if it's like, and that opens up this whole like kibbutz building question, what is, what flavor of kibbutz are you building to? Do you want everybody to have like an equal share? Do they want you, do you want to elect a set of devs that have like the right to hot patch stuff? Like, it's, it's, these are like fun human problems, which I think you hit.
00:23:28.168 - 00:24:11.092, Speaker B: The nail on the head and like, you know, and we're still relatively new to it, so you obviously are, have been deep in the weeds on it. But I think that that idea for me of like stopping for a second and going, wait, I can't just make this decision and do this at some point. Obviously, that has to transition to do we need to allocate to a certain set of devs and have that voted on to make this hot patch or everything across the entire spectrum of the ecosystem. And just remembering that that is one thing that definitely takes some getting used to that I would say is arguably probably more simplistic in the centralized world, but ultimately ends up being worth it, I think because you do want to get to a point of sufficient decentralization.
00:24:11.188 - 00:24:37.208, Speaker A: So, did you closely follow the sushi saga? I thought it was amazing that. How quickly that kibbutz formed, that there was this, like, new token new meme. A bunch of people loved it, and everything fell apart. It just, like, blew up. Right. Like, but enough people were, like, within the overall crypto community. Right? Like, we.
00:24:37.208 - 00:24:39.000, Speaker A: We weren't even part of ethereum.
00:24:39.072 - 00:24:39.488, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:39.576 - 00:24:50.960, Speaker A: But we were, like, watching it closely because we were, like, tangentially attached to that, and we're, like, nobody wanted it to fail. And there was, like, enough of a kind of, like, kibbutz's around it.
00:24:51.032 - 00:25:09.982, Speaker B: That rally. That rally together. It was like the clans that said, like, hey, we're not gonna let this thing go to shit. And so that, to me, is. Was pretty incredible. And it's funny how, like, social media plays into it so much also. And it's just kind of, like, our most common form of communication in crypto and.
00:25:09.982 - 00:25:28.836, Speaker B: And how that, like, kind of the virality of that story and kind of just how it spread and then what came out of it and watching it all kind of unfold in real time was pretty. Was pretty amazing, but, yeah, that's so funny. You're making the kibbutz reference to sushi swap. I like it.
00:25:29.030 - 00:25:41.724, Speaker A: I don't think it would be possible to, like, the difficulty with building a community, I think, intentionally, is that, like, it's hard to, like, get that ball rolling. Like, with sushi, it, like, kind of rolled itself.
00:25:42.104 - 00:25:42.504, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:42.544 - 00:25:58.078, Speaker A: And that's. That's like a, you know, you can't replicate it. Right. Like, the real, like, work is, like, takes years to, like, get all the folks together, get them connected, start, like, figuring out where, like, this community value, like, capture happens.
00:25:58.166 - 00:26:02.598, Speaker B: Totally. What would you feel like with Solana? What was kind of the inflection point?
00:26:02.686 - 00:26:10.246, Speaker A: We had a set of validators that just kind of loved the idea that hardware could make the thing go faster.
00:26:10.390 - 00:26:11.154, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:12.254 - 00:26:37.712, Speaker A: There's just a group of people that are pc builders that are nerds about optimizations, about network problems that have basically, they've done DevOps all their life. They've understand hardware and they work with it. And our idea was that, like, hey, we can take the skills that you have. Right. Like, the thing that, you know, and make this, like, really fast thing that could disrupt all of the world's finance.
00:26:37.768 - 00:26:38.192, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:38.288 - 00:26:42.924, Speaker A: And that was enough to bring them together. Right. Like we needed them. Right. That was, like, the key part.
00:26:43.744 - 00:26:49.008, Speaker B: Were they. Were they guys you knew? Were they teams that you knew or they just randomly came forward like, around.
00:26:49.056 - 00:27:23.498, Speaker A: That time, cosmos kind of like they were about a year ahead of us, but they kind of put together this, like, validator community, and a subset of those folks were like our people. And it's not like they left Cosmos. They're still running Cosmos zones. A bunch of them run, you know, cosmos and a bunch of other Cosmos networks. But, like, we, like, needed them. And they're like, oh, this is cool. Like, they were needed, right? There's like a huge, powerful effect of, like, if somebody, like, is trying to build something and they need your help, like, legitimately, it's like a very, it's a thing that brings people together.
00:27:23.666 - 00:28:14.674, Speaker B: I love it. That's so true. Actually, when we first launched hero and we just stealth launched it and gave out some token, the token had no value at the time. We just gave out some tokens to people and said, hey, try this out to 30, 40 people. Then it took off. I remember having so many people who had no idea who they were hitting me up saying, how can I help? How can I help? Whether it was developers, a lot of people in the community, and it's just to see people attach onto the, to this, like, thing, to me that there's something so powerful, whether it's being an engineer or being part of a community or whatever, like, there's something so powerful in just being a part of something that's larger than you are, that that has meaning and has purpose and really just, like, committing to it. It's really, I think, just from the human element, it's very empowering.
00:28:14.674 - 00:28:22.018, Speaker B: And I think it's amazing to see it's something in crypto that's like, to me, it's like, definitely one of the more positive aspects of the industry.
00:28:22.186 - 00:28:46.642, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's what makes it so sticky is that people are working on it, not like, you know, the money helps. Right. The money is what allows you to go full time, but if it disappeared, you would still kind of do it as a hobby. Right. And that gives it, like, this really, like, long term survive survivability. Like, you know, FreeBSD, there's still people building.
00:28:46.698 - 00:28:47.334, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:47.714 - 00:28:48.454, Speaker A: Like.
00:28:50.514 - 00:30:18.552, Speaker B: It'S funny on the money aspect, and there's obviously so many people that are here just for the financial incentives that exist, and obviously the trading aspect is there and whatnot. But I always try to think about, you have to take a step back and realize how progressive and how early of a world that we operate in. And you're almost like, if you're here as a speculator, you're almost like saying, okay, I'm willing to be the test bunny and like, even more so with my capital. And it's funny to see, like, I think you kind of can see a lot of people that get into the space because they hear about it and they hear about, you know, bitcoin going from 3000 to 60,000 or whatever and they don't realize that they're actually like a part of a massive experiment that iterates like, basically as fast as lightning. And there's nothing that it's the most uninhibited form of experimentation in finance and just in engineering and just everything all at once. And it's funny when you see people when they're like, well, I came here with $10,000 and I made a million and then it went to zero, all in eight weeks. And the fact that that happens, but I kind of look at that as like the, the in kind of that Gartner cycle, that hype cycle that exists with projects is like, it's the market's way of just saying like, hey, I'm willing to fund you for the long haul.
00:30:18.552 - 00:31:32.094, Speaker B: And like, the question is, like, does that team, like, are they taking that capital from that like kind of initial hype and idea that they're building and can they take that and then kind of, you know, put a plan in place that gives them, like, does this ultimately have long term objectives? Like, one thing that I love that serum did was that seven year lockup. And it sounds so counterintuitive in crypto with the speed that things move. But that was a signal for me, for example, of like, wait a minute, serum is not here to build something really fast and kind of make it, make it cool and exciting and then everyone will forget about it five minutes later. Its really here to build the plumbing and tooling that will one day, hopefully, the New York Stock Exchange is going to build on top of or the Chicago Mercantile exchange or some form of that that becomes as large. And its such a strong signal. And I also think its kind of a testament to where were at just in the cycle of crypto as a whole of starting to see more and more projects. And obviously when youre building big layer one blockchains like salon and stuff, you want this to survive generations, obviously.
00:31:32.474 - 00:31:37.574, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I think this is going to be like my life's work at this point.
00:31:38.914 - 00:31:52.770, Speaker B: I would guess so at this point. Yeah. If somebody doesn't go on the Internet and look your name up and know that, like, this is your life's work at this point, then. Yes, probably. But I agree. Serum was very impactful for me. It got me thinking a lot about, about hero.
00:31:52.770 - 00:32:14.854, Speaker B: And just again, like I was talking about when we were beginning of our discussion of, like, the timing of things and just like that, the time was right to really start moving towards decentralizing this and kind of getting this to a place that far outgrows us or our efforts. And, you know, and this has turned, definitely turned into my life's work at this point. So I can totally empathize with that.
00:32:15.474 - 00:32:23.914, Speaker A: You know, I thought this was going to be like a conversation about options and, like, finance, but it's awesome that it's about, like, community building. And Mkibut says.
00:32:25.894 - 00:32:31.110, Speaker B: That'S funny. That's. Yeah, look, the, the option stuff is, it's great.
00:32:31.142 - 00:32:31.582, Speaker A: There's.
00:32:31.678 - 00:33:35.464, Speaker B: I do have a much larger looking, you know, kind of maybe it's more philosophical view of kind of where the world will be. And, you know, a lot of that is, you know, what is my part in that? Like, what kind of path do I want to set forth for the, for the hero community at least like, kind of put the kernels in place and then let the community kind of drive it from there. And that, to me, really is kind of that philosophy going with like, okay, my place in this really is building these very simple protocols and make those raw protocols very easy to build, too. So large operators can then come and easily attach to them. And those large operators already have massive user pools and presenting, hopefully we're creating that plumbing and tooling for them that they can then take those and build the types of products that they want off of those and then provide it to their user base and create value.
00:33:37.124 - 00:33:59.842, Speaker A: That's awesome. I think that the space is so early that building out and, like, testing all these financial money legos and building the kabbutz around them, it's like those might survive, right? Like, there's like a chance that this might be still the same thing happening 100 years from now.
00:34:00.018 - 00:35:24.332, Speaker B: I feel like you're spot on. And, like, we're building the pipes for, like, for the kibbutz to have water, you know, and then, you know, they, the kibbutz will iterate towards complex drip irrigation, which is, you know, a feat of the miracle that you can grow plants in the middle of the desert now because of it. But when they were figuring out how to get water in, like, it was just about figuring out getting water in and not necessarily, you know, the advancements that a, you know, a bunch of engineers from Technion were going to figure out. So. So, yeah, I feel like that coupled with the restating of infrastructure in finance, and with that comes things like trading. And I think theres going to be so much more merging, which is another one of our early hero theses of the merging of finance with gaming and what can be traded, what can reasonably be traded, what can be hedged. There's all this stuff that's this big ball of wax that's moving around across these different market segments that I think we were trying to capture a bunch of those, but the reality, and I think we're the real value, what has to be there are those foundational elements first and really building that plumbing and that's really what Hero Network is dedicated to.
00:35:24.508 - 00:35:33.604, Speaker A: Awesome. On that note, is there anything that you'd want to tell our users where to find more about hero and what to look forward to?
00:35:33.984 - 00:36:49.828, Speaker B: Yeah. So pending on when this podcast goes out, we're going to be rolling out our light paper. We've been keeping things relatively stealth, and there's definitely value in hyping things, but we kind of think what we have is something pretty special, as I think most founders do. And we're really thinking about this for, you know, to be here for the long term and just building a lot of hype up front didn't really seem optimal for us. So we just have been kind of building the initial kernels of what will end up being the foundations of the hero network. And we're going to start rolling out sometime in the beginning to middle of April, and we'll be sharing our light paper. We're definitely iterating on things like amms and how we look at those, trying to add some level of sophistication, like we're creating something called, we call Sam as a kind of semi ode to Samfreed, but it's smart, automated market maker and the concepts behind that is really moving past this kind of form of somewhat naive market making, where ultimately somebody that's putting capital into a liquidity pool, most of them aren't really going to have an idea of how to optimize that.
00:36:49.828 - 00:37:46.624, Speaker B: They're just doing it for whatever purposes, whatever their incentives are, but actually attaching an oracle, which is really like a probability oracle. And we're doing this in our paramutual markets first because those are much more simplistic in how choices are made in terms of position, because it's not related to price sensitivity or you don't have different types of complex orders going in. It literally is, will this market be higher or lower. Over this time period, the payout of each side is paramutualized. So it's depending on what each side's weight is in the total pool will determine how that side is paid out and the ideas around the underlying option, and then the paramutual payout. There are sets of teams that are already actively trading on this product that are committed to being the initial teams behind it. And what they'll do is submit as a contract before a contract goes live.
00:37:46.624 - 00:38:24.516, Speaker B: Like, as it's getting closer to the launch of that contract opening, what is the optimal position for that liquidity pool to take such that over n number of contracts that it ends up like zero to slightly positive ev, and then they're incentivized by sharing part of the transaction fee that comes out of it. And so those are the probability nodes. And then they submit those to a probability oracle. And then that Oracle is basically interacting with the order management system that is managing the liquidity pool. And then from there, it basically will take its position in the pool and more intelligently provide liquidity.
00:38:24.580 - 00:38:29.500, Speaker A: Is it the same pool as like the serum spot market, or is this like a different pool?
00:38:29.612 - 00:38:53.200, Speaker B: Different pool. These will be their own liquidity pools initially. Got it. And they're going to be specific to the paramutual markets, which is the first protocol that, that we're launching. And then we're just going to test the effectiveness of all that. And then we've already started kind of iterating towards doing this with the next protocols that are going to be launched, which are variations on, like, vanilla options and on different light exotics.
00:38:53.272 - 00:38:54.024, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:38:54.144 - 00:38:55.816, Speaker B: Yeah, we're excited. Very excited about it.
00:38:55.880 - 00:38:59.912, Speaker A: Cool. Well, yeah, thank you for being on the show. This was an awesome conversation.
00:39:00.008 - 00:39:00.504, Speaker B: Yeah, totally.
00:39:00.544 - 00:39:03.440, Speaker A: And like, you guys are rocking it. Love, love all the progress.
00:39:03.512 - 00:39:18.372, Speaker B: Thanks, man. I really appreciate it. And, yeah, we're obviously super excited to be a part of the Solana community. It's been such a good vibe with the entire community. It's like very great support and excited to really be a part of it and help it grow.
00:39:18.468 - 00:39:19.524, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much.
