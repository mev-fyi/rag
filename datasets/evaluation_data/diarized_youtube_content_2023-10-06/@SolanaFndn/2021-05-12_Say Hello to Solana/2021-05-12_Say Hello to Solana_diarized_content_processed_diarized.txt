00:00:00.360 - 00:00:43.234, Speaker A: Let me ask you a question. Tired of high fees and slow transactions? So are we. Public blockchains have opened the door for anyone with an Internet connection to create and access digital markets. The global financial system has the potential to become more innovative, efficient and democratized. But there's a problem. Legacy blockchains don't scale, and therefore the crypto apps built on top count either. As usage has increased, so have the fees and transaction wait times, preventing crypto ecosystems from reaching their full potential.
00:00:43.234 - 00:01:37.974, Speaker A: Enter Solana. The Solana blockchain is fast, really fast, and it's low cost, with average fees less than a cent per transaction. What's more, Solana empowers developers to rapidly experiment and deploy apps using composable building blocks, while never dealing with additional friction introduced by sharding or fragmented L2 systems. Lastly, Solana is censorship resistant and scales as its ecosystem grows to billions of users globally, meaning the network will remain open for applications to run freely and transactions will never be stopped. Yes, Solana is truly unstoppable, now and forever. So say goodbye to slow transactions and high fees. And say hello to Solana, where you can build crypto apps that scale today.
