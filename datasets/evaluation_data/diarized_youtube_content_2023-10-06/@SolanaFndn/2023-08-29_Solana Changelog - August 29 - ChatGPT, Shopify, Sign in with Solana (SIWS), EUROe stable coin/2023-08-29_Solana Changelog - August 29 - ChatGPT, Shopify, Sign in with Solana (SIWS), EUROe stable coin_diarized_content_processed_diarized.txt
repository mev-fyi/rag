00:00:00.560 - 00:00:42.714, Speaker A: Hi, this is John with the Solana Foundation Devrel team. Today I'm joined with Colin for this week's Changelog. To start off this week we have the OpenAI chat GPT plugin now live in the OpenAI plugin store. It's an open source repo that you can use as a reference implementation for integrating AI with Solana. All you have to do is go to chatgpt, enable plugins, go to the plugin store and search for Solana to test out the plugin. Next we have the euro e stablecoin launching on Solana, so we now have a euro representation of a stablecoin on the Solana network to further expand payments and real world applications. Next we'll move on to Colin to introduce this week's commit highlights CoLIN Yep.
00:00:42.874 - 00:01:54.104, Speaker B: The commit that I picked out for this particular week is for the Solana install ClI. Now shall I say? Finally, you can now list all of the current installed Solana versions that you have on your machine. Even for me personally, that's actually such a great win because having to navigate and almost reinstall versions that I'm pretty sure that I had already, this kind of just makes that experience a hell of a lot smoother. And then moving on to recesses of the week, this week we saw almost like every single team launching a new feature or doing something cool. And in no particular order. The first one I wanted to pick out was sign in with Solana, and this was released by Phantom and was worked also worked with Jordan Sexton, who's an engineer at Solana Labs, which kind of just makes the almost like the signing in feature so much simpler. So rather than having to connect your wallet and then sign a message, this sign in is just like one method that you have and also standardizes the the message that has to be signed to in quotes, authenticate a user.
00:01:54.104 - 00:02:10.448, Speaker B: So this is really cool. It's also open source and I believe it also follows the sign in with Ethereum spare quite closely. So that's definitely something to look into. And I believe there's already four or five dapps that have integrated it, so it's really cool. Definitely check that out.
00:02:10.616 - 00:02:45.914, Speaker A: In addition to the sign in with Solana integration by Fantom, we also have the a Shopify integration with Solana Pay announced this week. This will allow merchants to more easily integrate their payment checkout flow with Solana to even further help with real world integration of Solana and merchant use cases. Next we have the elusive announcement for private token swaps on Solana, which further enhances the Solana Defi ecosystem. Go to elusive app to test it out. Colin, was there anything else you saw for the week that you'd like to share?
00:02:47.214 - 00:03:22.586, Speaker B: Yes, actually. So there was two other resources that I wanted to highlight. One of them is Solana Playground. And if you don't know what Solana Playground is, is the quickest and easiest way to start development on Solana directly in your browser. Now, it actually supports the rust analyzer. So now as you're writing your programs on the browser, you can easily see any errors or any suggestions and improvement that the RoS analyzer has. So that's a very, very almost like much needed feature added to the Solana playground.
00:03:22.586 - 00:04:19.092, Speaker B: And not to be confusing, Ironforge also launches a product called Playground, which I guess if you're familiar with web two, and used something like Insomnia or Postman to kind of make HTTP requests and kind of like see all of the API calls. Playground is an environment where you can experiment with ionforge's API. So it allows you to do a number of things like look at the accounts, runtime, transactions runtime, and it actually supports a whole host of programs. I believe there's about more than 50 or so programs that you can interact with directly from the playground environment. So that's definitely something called launch by ironforge. And that wraps us up for this week's episode of Solana Changelog. Definitely join us again next week, and don't forget to subscribe to the newsletter.
00:04:19.092 - 00:04:21.724, Speaker B: But for this week, that's it. Thank you.
