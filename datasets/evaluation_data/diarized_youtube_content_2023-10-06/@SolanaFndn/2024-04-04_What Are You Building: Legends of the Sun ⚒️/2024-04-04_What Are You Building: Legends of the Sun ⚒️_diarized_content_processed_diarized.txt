00:00:04.120 - 00:00:06.598, Speaker B: Hello. Today I'm super excited to be joined by Spacemandev.
00:00:06.646 - 00:00:07.358, Speaker A: So please tell us, what.
00:00:07.366 - 00:00:08.022, Speaker B: Are you building?
00:00:08.158 - 00:00:29.836, Speaker A: We're building a number of things. All of it centers around legends of the sun, which is this unity web two game. From there, we're going to mint those items in that game as compressed objects. To enable that, we have generalized compression. Anyone can use this composable feature. From there, we're going to take that and build a central limit order book, which is only possible on Solana, where you can trade these low liquidity items in a fast and easy fashion.
00:00:29.940 - 00:00:34.900, Speaker B: It sounds amazing. That's like a super composable framework and can't wait to try it out.
00:00:34.972 - 00:00:36.348, Speaker A: Only possible on Solana. Awesome.
00:00:36.396 - 00:00:37.564, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Absolutely.
