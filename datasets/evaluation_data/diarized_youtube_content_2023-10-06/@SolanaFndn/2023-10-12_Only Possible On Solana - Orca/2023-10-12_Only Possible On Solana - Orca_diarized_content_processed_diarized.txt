00:00:00.360 - 00:00:05.606, Speaker A: I think our unique journey of founding Orca would have only been possible on Solana.
00:00:05.670 - 00:00:11.914, Speaker B: It was the technology that allowed us to focus our energies on what I think is the fun part, creating cool products.
00:00:28.554 - 00:00:29.842, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Etaro.
00:00:29.978 - 00:00:32.894, Speaker A: And I'm Ori. And we're the founders of Orca.
00:00:33.514 - 00:00:36.362, Speaker C: Orca is the marketplace for Solana.
00:00:36.458 - 00:00:45.874, Speaker D: It enables anyone to buy or sell tokens for a fair price. What we're trying to build for the future is a better way, or a.
00:00:45.914 - 00:00:48.290, Speaker C: New way to do capital formation.
00:00:48.482 - 00:00:58.548, Speaker D: We want to do this in a way that's much more Internet native, much more digital. And in our opinion, what that means is it's built on something like a blockchain.
00:00:58.676 - 00:01:06.972, Speaker A: And so what Orca is, is really this bridge, I think, between all these different protocols which express themselves in the forms of tokens.
00:01:07.068 - 00:01:09.124, Speaker D: And there's a lot of additional complexity.
00:01:09.164 - 00:01:15.332, Speaker C: That'S required to figure out how to trade tokens seamlessly from one person to another.
00:01:15.508 - 00:01:17.996, Speaker D: And that's where Orca steps in.
00:01:18.100 - 00:01:23.454, Speaker A: More so than really just a marketplace. Orca is also this defi lego that.
00:01:23.494 - 00:01:26.234, Speaker B: Allows people to actually build other things.
00:01:27.414 - 00:01:51.410, Speaker A: What I think is really exciting is reframing it to not be about the technology, but being about what people can actually do. Like, of course, it's made up of programs. The different programs will interact with each other, and it's possible for programs to use orca, but at the end of the day, those programs serve the purpose of empowering people, of creating economic opportunity, of making it easier to actually do.
00:01:51.442 - 00:01:53.906, Speaker B: Capital formation and get an idea off the ground.
00:01:54.010 - 00:02:04.178, Speaker A: And so really just bringing it back to what are we spending all this time building the technology for? It's to increase the capabilities of people. Solana's core technology is a blockchain.
00:02:04.226 - 00:02:05.850, Speaker B: But it's not just a blockchain.
00:02:06.002 - 00:02:15.714, Speaker A: It's this way of recording data and accessing data that is incredibly fast, reliable, secure, affordable, and decentralized.
00:02:15.834 - 00:02:19.418, Speaker D: What immediately stood out with Solana was kind of.
00:02:19.418 - 00:02:23.754, Speaker C: Kind of this almost maniac focus on.
00:02:23.914 - 00:02:28.298, Speaker D: Low latency and high throughput. And that really clicked with us.
00:02:28.426 - 00:02:30.346, Speaker A: We've already been through the days of.
00:02:30.370 - 00:02:31.906, Speaker B: Dial up, we've been through the days.
00:02:31.930 - 00:02:33.674, Speaker A: Of having to wait for anything to.
00:02:33.714 - 00:02:38.130, Speaker B: Happen when using a web application. Whereas with Solana, what we were able.
00:02:38.162 - 00:02:42.138, Speaker A: To do is create something that actually had no waiting time.
00:02:42.186 - 00:02:44.122, Speaker B: And that was really radical, to be.
00:02:44.138 - 00:02:46.746, Speaker A: Able to create something that feels nearly instant.
00:02:46.810 - 00:03:07.242, Speaker C: Yeah. So there's a direct way, a very, very direct way in which building on Solana increases accessibility. And that's just the low fees, the fact that users can trade, and the marginal additional cost is just, you know, 0.001, Sol or whatnot. That dramatically decreases the barrier.
00:03:07.338 - 00:03:09.106, Speaker A: With Solana, you actually don't need to.
00:03:09.130 - 00:03:18.858, Speaker B: Spend any of that effort that currently people are doing right now to create these kind of like, hacks or workarounds to get scalability, performance, et cetera. Like, if you get those things out.
00:03:18.866 - 00:03:20.106, Speaker A: Of the box, then you actually have.
00:03:20.130 - 00:03:23.304, Speaker B: A lot more room to spend your mental energy on innovation.
