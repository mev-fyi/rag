00:00:04.720 - 00:00:06.554, Speaker A: Matt, welcome to validated.
00:00:07.174 - 00:00:08.534, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Awesome.
00:00:08.694 - 00:00:40.714, Speaker A: One of the things I am really looking forward to talking to you about today is your role at thesis. I want to talk a bit about the merger of Keep and Nucypher that went into creating the threshold network for folks not familiar with it. I think mergers in this space are rare. They usually don't work, but especially they're usually rare among 2d decentralized network. So I really want to talk about that a bit. But primarily here today, I want to talk about threshold BTC. Um, because.
00:00:40.714 - 00:00:48.622, Speaker A: Love it, hate it, you can't ignore it. Bitcoin is the backbone of collateral and defi nowadays.
00:00:48.718 - 00:00:49.134, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:49.214 - 00:01:26.374, Speaker A: And so you know what that means though, is bitcoin is of course a network where there are no smart contracts and taproot people. I'm sorry, there are still no smart contracts. Uh, there's no real smart contracts on bitcoin that exist today. And so what that means is every instance of bitcoin that exists somewhere else in the world on someone else's network, whether that's bitcoin on Ethereum, bitcoin on Solana, bitcoin on centralized exchanges. Yeah, those are all custody versions of bitcoin. Bitcoin is inherently custodial when it exists on someone else's network. But not all custody solutions are created equal.
00:01:26.374 - 00:01:51.154, Speaker A: Some of those are centralized through trusted providers like Bitgo, who is behind wrapped bitcoin, which is sort of, I'd say probably the market dominant version bitcoin that exists today. And then some of that is through other decentralized custody solutions. And this is where threshold network comes into play in the TBTC product. So I'm excited to get into all of this here today with you unvalidated.
00:01:51.854 - 00:01:53.474, Speaker B: Sam, where do you want to start?
00:01:54.054 - 00:02:08.454, Speaker A: I want to start with the threshold network itself and thesis and the origins of TBTC, for those. I'm not sure if actually you know this, but back in the days, I used to work for bison trails and, you know.
00:02:08.534 - 00:02:09.550, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:09.582 - 00:02:24.294, Speaker A: And so the launch of Keep and Nucypher were actually two of the protocols that we helped support the Genesis for back in 2020 at Bison trails. So it's really cool to kind of have gone like full circle on this.
00:02:24.374 - 00:02:24.846, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:24.950 - 00:02:50.924, Speaker A: You know, at this point we were talking about like Genesis of people being like, I want to lock up some ethnic for a certain period of time, run some nodes, earn some tokens. But this was back in the days where I think pure play utility protocols were launching as almost their own entire network. I want to talk a little bit about where the vision for the threshold network came from.
00:02:51.464 - 00:03:22.104, Speaker B: Let's see. So I guess a little bit about me before TPTC and threshold keeping you cipher is I got into the space because I had a side hustle at my first startup, buying and selling gift cards. And I realized I could buy them for $0.60 on the dollar, solid for 95. I launched a website that did that, and PayPal immediately was like, no, no, no, that's great finance. You're out of here. And so that's actually how I got to bitcoin.
00:03:22.104 - 00:04:14.068, Speaker B: And I mentioned that because that has since spun out, become a completely different company, which is fold. But the reason that I mentioned that is because the reason that im interested in bitcoin is ultimately the same reason I got involved for the first place, which is I dont want to see people get deplatformed, I dont think, but there should be someone deciding what is or isnt a good use for your money. And frankly, just as an entrepreneur, I knew the solution, and at the time, bitcoin was the solution. So fast forwarding to TBDC, we started building keep. And the idea with keep was I very quickly, when I got into Ethereum was like, oh, cool, this makes a lot of sense. Smart contracts make sense. It just clicked with my engineer brain.
00:04:14.068 - 00:05:40.810, Speaker B: But what I immediately struggled with is thinking about all the applications where you have data, for example, Social Security number, and most of the time in adapt, you just want to keep that data local, right? So like, look, this user should only have access to this data, but every once in a while, you actually need private information to be socialized. So maybe you don't want every counterparty to have access to the data and clear text, but you need them to be able to say, no, I'm confident it was this person with the Social Security number, or I'm confident that it's the same person with the same Social Security number. And so this was the battle days. This is 2017, 2018. And so we were like, okay, well, how would you build an EHR on top of Ethereum? How would you work with health data? As we dug more and more into some of these problems and some of the apps that we wanted to launch, which had to do with gift cards and all sorts of weird bits of gray finance, as paypal might call it, we realized that there was this missing piece, which is, okay, well, how can you actually custody private data off chain in a way that is still something you can reason about on chain? So you still need to be able to say, no, no, im confident this person has access to this particular credit card number or gift card number or social or whatever. And so thats what originally led to me spending time on keep. So the mathematical technique used here is multi party competition.
00:05:40.810 - 00:06:30.584, Speaker B: And we hear about NPC all the time today because people are talking about it in wallets. But in 2017, this was something that really hadnt been applied to chains at all. The only idea of privacy at the time was zcashs version of privacy, which is a very specific application of starks. So thats what originally got us into keeping. But it didnt take long before we realized that the best immediate application for all the multiparty computation we were playing with was actually breaching. So when you look at bitcoin, its like looking at an alien culture. So if youre in Solana, if youre on Ethereum, you have a very specific kind of technology first or technology optimistic way of looking at the world.
00:06:30.584 - 00:06:45.620, Speaker B: Most of those elements of bitcoin culture left. They left after the block size debate. But it's not because the small blockers were wrong. Small blockers were definitely right. Like history has shown that on, you know, they were right.
00:06:45.652 - 00:06:51.844, Speaker A: Wait, let's go into that for a second. Tell me why these small blockers were unequivocally, definitely right.
00:06:51.924 - 00:07:25.226, Speaker B: So here's why. I think they were unequivocally, definitely right. And this isn't true of every network, but bitcoin. Its entire premise and purpose was about being first and about being unbreakable. And the whole crypto market has been built. The most terrifying thing about the flippening, and if that ever happens, it's not, oh, my God, my bags, or whatever. It's, how does the space work? If bitcoin is not number one, how do we reason about things? And a lot of people say, oh, it works fine.
00:07:25.226 - 00:07:38.746, Speaker B: It could be ETH or solar this or that or the other. But I would argue that, no, I think we probably need another four to eight years before we're really confident. No, I know. I'm here to provoke you, Austin.
00:07:38.810 - 00:07:56.878, Speaker A: We're six minutes into recording or off the rails, and I love it. So I want to push you on this. Yeah, please. Because I think I'm one of those people who sort of like, yep, bitcoin's useful. Bitcoin's great. Bitcoin is not a part of the day to day lives of almost anyone. Right.
00:07:56.878 - 00:08:05.830, Speaker A: Like, you know, and I don't mean that as a derogatory term for bitcoin. I don't think much about the bond market? I don't really feel like the bond market is like the underpinning that keeps.
00:08:05.862 - 00:08:09.714, Speaker B: The size of the bond market. Yeah, no, I hear you.
00:08:10.694 - 00:08:12.126, Speaker A: So I'm not going to tell me.
00:08:12.190 - 00:08:15.374, Speaker B: I won't try to completely convince you because that'll take more than the hour.
00:08:15.414 - 00:08:28.310, Speaker A: We'Re, but give me, give me your, give me your argument for why. Um, the flipping is as a cultural moment, something that people should be at the very least paying attention to and thinking about.
00:08:28.422 - 00:08:49.954, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So um, so I'm going to talk a lot about people who are outside the space rather than how we feel inside the space because I think it's pretty different. A lot of people outside the space think everything is bitcoin. Every cryptocurrency thing is bitcoin. Either they think that or they think that every cryptocurrency thing is a dog themed scam. Thats about it. They dont have like theres not a lot of nuance.
00:08:49.954 - 00:09:40.708, Speaker B: If you look at a chart from one to 3000 assets, its easy to talk about one. The second you start talking about two, youve introduced why, whats the difference? And when you talk about 1020, 30 40, suddenly to understand that list of assets, you need to really be deep in our space and say no, no, no, this thing over here with this sticker youve never heard of, it is a scam. But this thing actually, it's just a very choice token and you have to have all this rationale. People suddenly are being asked, well, are you excited about the tech of Solana? Are you excited about the economics of Ethereum? So there's all this nuance that I think is incredibly difficult for people out of our space to keep track of. So that's my like in group versus out of group, right? Sure. Does that kind of make sense? So like if, if we don't have a number one that people can understand, I don't see how they're going to understand the next few hundred.
00:09:40.816 - 00:10:03.504, Speaker A: So I guess my argument would be that gold does not actually run the world economy anymore. And that like, yes, like you can look at gold and on one level you can be very intrinsically like, okay, I get it. Shiny metal, valuable. That seems to make much more sense than a mortgage backed security or pork barrel futures on the other side. Like gold, shiny thing, money.
00:10:04.604 - 00:10:05.228, Speaker B: Sure.
00:10:05.356 - 00:10:13.554, Speaker A: Why you can't eat it. It's actually not that rare. Like there's a whole bunch of reasons why, like like the gold standard didn't.
00:10:13.594 - 00:10:39.374, Speaker B: It's funny to be you brought up gold, not me. Have you noticed I haven't set digital gold once. I haven't played into any of that. I've just said if something is number one, it's not number one anymore. I think that the world right now looks at crypto as an asset class. And I think when they think about that asset class, what they're mostly thinking about is the properties of bitcoin. And I think that asking them to understand the top 100 and market cap is really big.
00:10:39.374 - 00:11:11.734, Speaker B: And so I think if and when, ill stick with if. I guess if there is a flipping, I think that the amount that the world is going to need to understand about crypto to differentiate between all of these different assets, its pretty incredible. And frankly, if they take the time to understand, well have already won. Right? Because well have told every person. So maybe what I'm saying is we shouldn't get too excited about the flipping incoming too early because I think it could. I frankly think if you kill the space happens too early.
00:11:13.274 - 00:11:24.810, Speaker A: Isn't that sort of like saying if apple becomes more valuable than a national currency, then that national currency? I guess the analogy, it's more like.
00:11:24.842 - 00:11:30.034, Speaker B: Saying if Apple is more valuable than USDA and that would be shocking. Yes.
00:11:34.214 - 00:12:00.894, Speaker A: Interesting. Is Aramco more valuable than the saudi sovereign wealth fund? Now, I think the answer is no because they owned a bunch of Aramco. But I think there's an existential question there about, well, implicit in that assumption, and this is where we bring it back to threshold. Bitcoin is that bitcoin is the reserve currency of blockchain. Do you think that's accurate?
00:12:02.474 - 00:13:11.728, Speaker B: I think that it should be. I think first, the reason the Aramco saudi thing doesn't work out is because Apple being larger than USD is important because USD is the world's reserve currency being larger than another small country or even in other large countries, you know, currency or GDP or whichever specific country specific HIPAA you want to use, its not that big a deal. Its when something goes from being number one that everyone believes deeply its number one, to being number two, that all of the economic rules get reset. So right now in our space we have this rough four year cycle. And okay, im not trying to predict prices, but like what else has a rough four year cycle? Right? So I guess my point really is just that doesnt mean bitcoin needs to be number one forever, it means the second its not, the space is going to change a lot and we should make sure were ready. But yeah, bringing it back to TBTC, I think BTC should be collateral cross space. I think that a lot of us have a tendency to think that whoever wins should have the best tech, a lot of us who arent bitcoiners.
00:13:11.728 - 00:14:00.288, Speaker B: So basically everyone else, the whole rest of the space. I think that feels like theres this race between tech and speed. Sometimes they care about reliability, sometimes they dont. But theres this kind of fight. And so its easy to say who cares about bitcoin? But instead of trying to convince you that bitcoin is good collateral, I think its probably easier to just say why in the world are we talking about real world assets which require all sorts of nonsense to get on chain and obviously can never really be fully natively on chain when we have bitcoin. Thats twice the size of its next crypto asset that we can pull onto these chains. So I think really, when Im talking to people who are already sort of crypto pill and theyre already like, no, no, no, its about the tech and its about this smart contract, this part of defi, this permissionless, this.
00:14:00.288 - 00:14:16.412, Speaker B: Well its like you should reach for bitcoin first because real world assets, like who cares if you tokenize the skyscraper and put it on chain? Because thats one quarter away from being worth nothing. And I think we can do better with bitcoin and the existing on chain assets.
00:14:16.588 - 00:14:24.252, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess let me just kind of strongman a counter here, which is that bitcoin isn't actually on chain if you're not on bitcoin.
00:14:24.348 - 00:14:24.604, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:24.644 - 00:15:00.398, Speaker A: On every other network, as we talked about, there's some form of custody risk. And I think I would actually say at this point, the smart contract risk in EVM space or the SVM space, or basically any smart contract risk is probably higher than the existential risk that, I don't know. Let's just say that the US government eminent domains, a skyscraper in New York City, I think that's probably a less likely event to happen. Or that the fundamental property rights of tokenized minerals in the United States get changed than a smart contract gets hacked on Ethereum or Solana.
00:15:00.446 - 00:15:46.774, Speaker B: Sure. So let's say we can't get perfect non custodial interaction with bitcoin. There's still a whole variety of other things. My favorite way to measure the decentralization of a system, and using the word decentralization, is already a huge flag. But let's just let it lie for a second, is how many doors have to be knocked down before you can make something stop. So it's one door for real world assets usually it's one court order or one off the store. And even bitcoin, without built in interoperability with our other chains, we can get into thousands of doors before these assets can be, Kirsten, compelled or censored.
00:15:46.774 - 00:16:11.276, Speaker B: Now, it's not perfect, don't get me wrong, but I still think that that's such a huge improvement over real world assets. And so, yeah, I think that's the argument I'd make. And also I think bitcoin will get bigger faster than your real world assets will get censorship resistant. So that would be maybe my follow up. Yeah.
00:16:11.300 - 00:16:39.024, Speaker A: So I think this is where sort of TBTC comes into play. Because you know what you said about knocking on a thousand doors. Historically it's been one door, right? It's been one company that controls most of the represented bitcoin between one network and another. Whether that was an exchange or whether that was a custodian. Fundamentally, there is still one court order. Now it's targeting a legal entity, not an individual. But that's the same thing with a skyscraper.
00:16:40.284 - 00:17:05.222, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So the idea with KBTC is to take what WBTC has done, which is to make the posable and tool. I mean, depending on who you are. If you're a bitcoin, you're like, we are gracing defi with our presence. And if you're a defi person, you're like, okay, well, finally bitcoin is caught up, so you can take whichever side you want. But, um. But the idea with TBTC is to do the same thing, to make bitcoin composable, to make it work like any other token.
00:17:05.222 - 00:17:29.344, Speaker B: Um, but it's to do it in a way that, um. Yeah, you're not just like calling Mike bell sheet. You're not just reaching out to the bitco like trust company, but you actually need to, um, hit up a lot of people to break the guarantees of the system. It's not perfect. It's TPTCV one, I would say. Actually, TPTCV one, I might almost say was perfect. It was just incredibly expensive and capital hungry.
00:17:29.344 - 00:17:41.116, Speaker B: V two is much cheaper and easier to use. But now we're slowly having to increase the decentralization and make that number go from 20 to 200 to 2000. Yeah.
00:17:41.140 - 00:17:45.324, Speaker A: So let's get into V one and V two. How does threshold bitcoin actually work?
00:17:45.484 - 00:18:19.884, Speaker B: Yeah, so TB two, CB one, it was a pretty, I say it's a simple idea. It wasn't a simple idea. It was this concept that, okay, bitcoin can't really be moved to another chain. So there has to be a custodian somewhere. So what we did was we said, okay, what if our custodians are three of three multi six that are chosen randomly? So right now we're just talking about three random people in the world that you trust with your bitcoin. Clearly not a great mechanism, right. But then you go to the next step and you say, okay, they have to be stakers in the system, okay, so they have something and they have to put down some other collateral.
00:18:19.884 - 00:19:21.716, Speaker B: So in TBTCB one that was just ETH, they put down 150% of the BTC that they would be protecting in heath. And so suddenly it's like you have a bridge that is relying on custodians to not steal, but then you take something of the custodians and then you can prove if they've been dishonest and you can take their assets. So thats cool, except for it launched around the same time as ETH two. And what weve learned from Defi summer and ever since is capital efficiency is king, right. So if everyone is trying to stake their ETH, stake their soul, they dont want to also stick it in a system like this where the returns that theyre going to get are just like bitcoin bridging fees, which are not super rich in aggregate theyre nice, but individually its not great. So what V two does is instead of these three of threes, we say, okay, well what if now you have a system thats 51 of 100 and what you introduce, and we use this in cryptography all the time, but not very much in cryptocurrency is this assumption called an honest majority.
00:19:21.820 - 00:19:22.436, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:22.580 - 00:19:37.620, Speaker B: So that is a huge security model shift. Right. Suddenly youve gone from, people are putting down all of these assets to people are staking to participate, but theres no way that the assets that they put down will cover the assets that could be lost in the bridge. Pretty bold. Yeah.
00:19:37.652 - 00:19:59.904, Speaker A: I mean, it's interesting because in v one, right, you have to trust two things. In v one, right, bitcoin will be valuable in the future. And if you're a bitcoiner, sure. The second is that the relative price between ETH and bitcoin will not diverge by more than 50%. Because if you're truly a bitcoin, maxi, and you're like, look, we're going a half a million dollars a token.
00:20:01.874 - 00:20:02.186, Speaker B: I.
00:20:02.210 - 00:20:07.618, Speaker A: Think the most bull case for bitcoin would blow past that 50% over collateralization pretty quickly.
00:20:07.786 - 00:20:13.754, Speaker B: Right. And now you've set up all these stakers who are actually taking a position against bitcoin, right? Yeah. Fundamentally, they don't want to be liquid.
00:20:13.794 - 00:20:17.410, Speaker A: Participating in v one. TBTC is short of bitcoin.
00:20:17.562 - 00:20:52.470, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So I mean, the most obvious place where this was a problem with v one, it was clear when we hit around 2500 BTC that there wasn't going to be a lot more ETH coming into the system. But the most obvious place was actually talking to stakers where they're like, why do we have to manage all these assets? Why do we need to manage an E B two C exposure? That's not what we want. We were early on in keeps lifecycle, so we had tokens to sort of COVID for that risk, but it was really uncomfortable and it was difficult to participate in the system. So v two removes all that. But what you're gaining is scalability.
00:20:52.470 - 00:21:03.954, Speaker B: What you're losing is economic assurance. Now you're saying, do I have probabilistic assurance? Am I, am I very confident that these people, most of them are honest?
00:21:04.254 - 00:21:37.720, Speaker A: And so why should someone trust the folks who run the threshold network, not like a centralized entity, but all the nodes? I think if you're looking at a network like Solana or Ethereum, the incentives are internal to that network, right. If you're running a Solana validator, you receive inflationary rewards, you receive transaction fee rewards. Same on Ethereum. If fundamentally the point of a network is to secure another type of asset which could theoretically become worth a lot more than that network, how does that game theory work?
00:21:37.872 - 00:22:14.756, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a serious asymmetry here, right? So there's this asymmetry between the assets that you're protecting and the people who are protecting it. And what it comes down to is, and this is where it gets really fun with game theorists. What model do you have of human behavior? Yeah. Do you believe humans are either honest or malicious? That's it. Either they're honest or they're malicious relative to a given system. Do you believe there's all these ideas of passive malice and passive honesty, but you know, how you can really look at it is forgetting about whether or not the participants are honest and just talking about whether they get hacked.
00:22:14.940 - 00:22:15.732, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:15.908 - 00:23:06.054, Speaker B: Right. So an argument that I would make in the favor of TBTC is that most holders have been doxxed, very heavily doxxed, from private sales, from keeping nucypher from a variety of exchange elements like, you know, it's permissionless to buy tea into stake, but the vast majority of people who have staked and it's something like 30% of the supply already very heavily doxed. So one is, you know, are they going to be malicious if they're incredibly heavily doxed? So the next is, okay, probably not. Let's go to our next level. What if they all get hacked? And this is where you really care about diversity of infrastructure. If everything is running on bison trails for some effort, Coinbase cloud. Everything's running on Coinbase cloud, or everything is just running on one particular operator.
00:23:06.054 - 00:23:30.112, Speaker B: Eventually, the DPRK is going to go after that. Eventually, someone with enough resources will take advantage of that asymmetry. Even if the people participating have an honest majority. I think that's where most of our job securing the system on the dev team side is. We're fairly confident that we have an honest majority. And I can tell you what we can do if we don't think we have it. We've got a lot of fun little levers.
00:23:30.112 - 00:23:36.764, Speaker B: The Dow can pull pretty quickly to cover that. But the biggest is just making sure that there are enough independent operators participate.
00:23:37.064 - 00:23:51.294, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm curious, because I think if you had to encapsulate the bitcoin view of the world in a nutshell, it's that you can't trust, trust people, and they are fundamentally malicious. Would you. Is that your worldview?
00:23:52.674 - 00:24:33.882, Speaker B: I think what I learned from V one, and really from years outside of just working on bitcoin, is that that is a fantastic perspective to take if you're building what you believe is the only way to save the world and their opportunity and a new freedom, money. I think if what you're. If what you believe and what you think you're doing is building interoperability between chains in a capital efficient way, I think it's like, well, clearly you have to relax that up. I mean, all of society breaks down if you don't relax that at least a little bit. Right. And absolutely, yes. Right.
00:24:33.882 - 00:24:34.170, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:34.202 - 00:24:35.986, Speaker A: So, I mean, I guess what I'm.
00:24:36.010 - 00:24:51.286, Speaker B: Saying is I keep my foot in both camps. Am I a doomer a little bit? Do I have children and trust them to public education? Yes. Do I grow all my own food? No. And so I think we're kind of in a similar spot here, pragmatically.
00:24:51.470 - 00:24:56.502, Speaker A: I mean, the fundamental bitcoin prepper argument falls apart when you realize they still need ISP's.
00:24:56.678 - 00:25:18.962, Speaker B: That's right. Exactly. Yeah. So this is the balance that I've found, and I think what I've seen is that ultimately, what I think people want is they want their money to work for them, they want to be able to not ask questions, not ask permission. Every time I use my debit card, it feels like, mother, may I? And I. I'm like, oh, it didn't work. Did I get a text? Let me check.
00:25:18.962 - 00:25:41.324, Speaker B: Like versus what we want with both bitcoin and TBTC, is this like mother, may I situation should never happen. Now, of course there's additional risk in using a bridge. Its always going to be safer to have bitcoin on l one on a five of nine multisig and some of the hardware wallets you buried various places. Absolutely.
00:25:41.364 - 00:25:44.580, Speaker A: That is statistically no one does that.
00:25:44.692 - 00:25:53.184, Speaker B: No one does that. And the reason no one does that, outside of it just being a huge pain in the ass, is because the tooling in bitcoin, frankly, is so difficult.
00:25:54.204 - 00:26:11.304, Speaker A: An electric multi signature society too. I think its also an important thing to note that. I don't know, there's always been this, like, the thing that always has turned me off from bitcoin as a community, not as a token or an asset or something like that, is that.
00:26:13.324 - 00:26:13.676, Speaker B: There'S.
00:26:13.700 - 00:26:55.518, Speaker A: This fundamental assumption that you can't trust anyone. And yet we trust like five core contributors of bitcoin to maintain the whole thing. We trust Kazakhstan to run 30% of the hash power. There's a lot of, I would call it ostrich introspection going on, right? Or it's like I'm only going to look at the tiny little piece and then my head goes in the sand for the rest. And so I'm kind of curious, how has threshold been received by the bitcoin community? Obviously, I think the folks who want to use bitcoin on Ethereum or Solana are thrilled that they no longer have to deal with a centralized custodian. But what is the result from the actual hardcore bitcoiners been?
00:26:55.696 - 00:27:03.114, Speaker B: Yeah, so I have never met a hardcore bitcoiner really. And I. Well, let me finish.
00:27:03.154 - 00:27:03.650, Speaker A: Sense.
00:27:03.762 - 00:27:36.104, Speaker B: Since 2014, I have never met a hardcore bitcoin that privately didn't play with every single other piece of tech that we all play with now on Twitter, I find them all the time. They tell me about their time preference and about their stake and I hear all those things, you know? And look, I mean, honestly, I'm a little bit. I'm a little part of that culture. Like, bitcoin taught me to save money. I did not understand how to save money before. I didn't understand like, what my place in society was, who was relying on, like, bitcoin has taught me a lot. And that culture, not even just the tech, but the actual culture has taught me a ton.
00:27:36.104 - 00:28:08.266, Speaker B: But yeah, I mean I most of the people who are the loudest hardcore bitcoiners or people who you think was shot about the system privately, play with it. And so I think the question becomes how much you will under risk. Right. So for me, I wanted to buy a house and all I had was bitcoin. And thats what got me to start TBTC is I said, I have bitcoin and id like to, can I get a house now? And theyre like, oh yeah, show us your bitcoin. I was like, here. And theyre like, well sell that and come back in 30 days and well pretend you didnt tell us.
00:28:08.266 - 00:28:43.142, Speaker B: And well say your source of funds is what? And im like, no, no, im not a criminal. Im just asking like, hey, I have hard money. Im good for it. Could I not take on so much debt? Could I just take a little debt so I can buy a house? And so I think a lot of people are most interested in seeing their property work for them. And for some people it might be okay, 95% is in their hoddle stash in that five of nine that they buried across the country, but maybe it's just 5% that they'll play with. I think a lot of people, it's probably more like 50% to 80% that they'll play with. And 30% is like savings that they're never going to touch.
00:28:43.142 - 00:29:18.244, Speaker B: So I guess all that to say what I found is that bitcoiners have been pretty, pretty down. What they don't like is they don't always like Ethereum. You can't say the e word. And I think one of the exciting things bringing TBTC to Solana is, you know, Ux is still rough. We're working on making it better, but people can kind of skip that. I think that there is a group of people who, they're fine with other chains, Wyatt Lee, but they do still worry about the flipping. And I think that's where like it becomes a cultural question rather than a technology question.
00:29:18.584 - 00:30:00.224, Speaker A: Yeah, the cultural thing is always, it was interesting for you to say sort of so strongly that you're worried about the flippening. And the reason, I guess, for me is that it's always felt to me like the analogy I sort of always think of is like the greek city states arguing with one another and fighting these little cute wars. And then just, you know, someone sweeping down the peninsula and being like, well, that was cute. But like, we've taken over now. And it's always felt to me that, like, this, this sort of inter crypto war between, like, whose culture is holier than thou? It just. It always feels to me like it's missing a lot of.
00:30:00.264 - 00:30:01.560, Speaker B: You just put your finger on it.
00:30:01.632 - 00:30:02.072, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:02.168 - 00:30:18.844, Speaker B: Tokens are religions and the worst civil war. Right? The worst wars are civil. And. And it's brother on brother, and it's over. Tiny differences that are totally, in the grand scheme of things, irrelevant. So, like, I mean, this is my whole. People like to talk about, like, the money.
00:30:18.844 - 00:30:39.504, Speaker B: Money versus tech. Yeah, right. And they talk about that in crypto. And I'm like. And culture and experience. There are all these other, like, pretty polarizing axes in our space. So I think the biggest thing, like, I'm an engineer who likes to design mostly decentralized protocols, right? Like, that's my thing.
00:30:39.504 - 00:31:03.290, Speaker B: I like to do the game theory, I like to do the mechanism design. But I feel like the thing that crypto has taught me is that people like to fight, that when they don't have anything to fight about, they'll invent sports and that all of our tickers are, I don't know, most of the trappings become religious or tribal very quickly.
00:31:03.392 - 00:31:32.684, Speaker A: So I would agree with you on that. But I would actually potentially say the reason the US dollar and the US financial system runs the world is it's not a religion. It's a ruthless, practical capitalist machine. And if what we want to do here is fundamentally create a religion, like, cool, that's cute, but I don't know if, like, there's a reason the US dollar world and there's no religion that runs the world, but there was.
00:31:32.844 - 00:32:17.604, Speaker B: Right? So, like, what, what would it require? Like, year would maybe be my counter. What would it require for the world to leave USD? And it's like, it's hard to imagine anything short of. I mean, I guess we continue to abuse the system and exclude people, so, like, we continuously erode its neutrality, but it does seem like a worldwide religion might be one of the things that could get big enough to convince people to switch. I don't disagree with you, though. Ultimately, if we're not building credibly neutral technology, there's no reason for people to switch. And if our arguing about various doge variants is expressed in the actual financial system we built, people shouldn't join. We deserve to be obscure.
00:32:18.984 - 00:33:10.694, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's like the piece that always. Okay, so I've used this analogy before for folks who listen to the show, but, like, Twitter listened to its customer base too much. And that's why it never succeeded. Whereas, like, Facebook is like american football, right? American football, you think it's this like good old american sport and it's like they rewrite the rules every five years. Like football of a decade ago and football played today have almost no relationship to one another. And besides, like, the team names are the same, right? Like, there's fundamental changes that go on, but it's this sort of national mythology that it stays the same. And I guess the thing that I always see about the bitcoin world is it's sort of like, you know, I brought the analogy up before about the gold folks, right? Because the folks who are still screaming about gold are still screaming about gold.
00:33:10.694 - 00:34:10.854, Speaker A: They're just screaming in a very small corner that no one pays any attention to. And I guess my concern has always been that, like, if that part of the blockchain industry is the part that stays, the part that is the most successful, the flippening for me is actually crypto going mainstream. It's not necessarily. And there is like, yes, going mainstream hurts. There's going to be a certain amount of this self custody absolutionism that does not survive crypto going mainstream. The question for me there is always, and I hate to say this, I mean, I love to say this, but threshold is a part of that, right? It's a part of the erosion of the yeoman standing in a castle in a field where there's no one else around him and that sort of rough and tumble american citadel self custody spirit. And instead threshold comes along and says, hey, man, there's a really good condo association over here.
00:34:10.854 - 00:34:13.162, Speaker A: Like totally, we got a pool, right?
00:34:13.218 - 00:35:00.374, Speaker B: Like so, so look, it's funny right now, we've been talking about, you know, crypto Twitter and how we view bitcoiners. But this kind of comes back to my original thought, which is I'm, I'm pretty sure that most people view crypto as just one thing. And I actually don't think they see the stake and I don't think they hear about savings. I don't think they've ever heard the words time preference. I think that what they see is all of us and then they see a big orange be. So part of me is like, Austin, well, lets just call the CEO of bitcoin and get this sorted out because this messaging is messed up and we got to get it all aligned. So look, I agree with you, obviously, if we could all move as a group and we could say, no, no, were building credibly neutral money.
00:35:00.374 - 00:35:12.280, Speaker B: We believe finance is a human right. We believe that individuals should have privacy, and we think that institutions should be afraid of individuals. Okay, it sounds pretty founding fathers, but there's a version of that.
00:35:12.312 - 00:35:13.484, Speaker A: Yeah, that's Eric forh.
00:35:13.784 - 00:35:45.950, Speaker B: Right. So, I mean, I guess what I'm getting at is just I don't think that the rest of the world views all of crypto. Like right now we're talking about sort of like bitcoin culture. I think that. I don't think they hear about the self custody stuff. And I think most people who have touched the space are just used to losing money on coinbase or binance. I just think that if bitcoin is not number one, whoever is number one, that's a chance for a narrative reset and they better nail it.
00:35:46.062 - 00:36:01.164, Speaker A: Yeah, it kind of reminds me of this is before I was born, but reading about the history of the free software movement and about how to them open source was a horrible bastardization of the values of computer science.
00:36:01.324 - 00:36:56.734, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, well, I mean, it's also a great example when we're talking about civil wars of like oss versus. Anyway, we could, we could nerd out, but yeah, I mean, sorry, going back, we've gone completely off the rails and it's been fun. Look, if you're a bitcoiner, what I'm trying to offer, what we are trying to offer, what threshold wants to offer, is a way to make your money useful. If you were a bitcoiner who is afraid that bitcoin is going to become irrelevant, what we're trying to build is a life raft. So I think it's like, I don't necessarily care if slaughter Ethereum people, I mean, not that they're the primary critics, but if they don't like TBTC, it's like, well, we're trying to help the people with the bitcoin. And I think what they want is mostly just, I have a lot of equity locked up in this asset and I would like to be able to leverage it. I like to be able to get USD.
00:36:56.734 - 00:37:32.102, Speaker B: That said, its been really interesting to see the people from the rest of crypto and who do want to hold bitcoin because I think in Solana in particular, what ive seen is the dows are interested in diversification. Then what ive seen in Ethereum and with ordinals is that we have another project at the studio thats ordinals project. And some of the survey work weve done, weve seen that something like 75% to 90% of ordinals users that weve been able to reach were Ethereum users first. Interesting, isnt it?
00:37:32.158 - 00:37:33.494, Speaker A: I would not have guessed that.
00:37:33.614 - 00:37:39.802, Speaker B: No, I had no clue. I had no clue. And im still like it was at least 5000 people. Just to give you an idea. It was pretty.
00:37:39.998 - 00:37:45.618, Speaker A: For those who aren't familiar, ordinals are an analogy to an NFT on the bitcoin network.
00:37:45.786 - 00:37:58.614, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So I just think that there are a lot of quiet people in the space working across all these things and they don't care what we're saying on Twitter and they don't care about our culture wars. They just want their money to be useful. I think those are the people that we're voting for.
00:37:58.954 - 00:38:14.728, Speaker A: Yeah. It's funny when you kind of put it that way, that there is. I mean, I would say that in some ways the flippening of bitcoin by something else is almost inevitable. The same way that it's hard to.
00:38:14.776 - 00:38:15.768, Speaker B: Stay number one forever.
00:38:15.856 - 00:38:29.480, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean it's not even that. It's just like synthetic financial products are worth far more than hard financial products. It's just a function of the multiplicative effects of finance is that the thing that is not the thing will always have more value than the thing.
00:38:29.672 - 00:38:30.404, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:31.224 - 00:39:11.168, Speaker A: And so it's interesting to think about like how does bitcoin kind of navigate that? I think there's a world where the bitcoin network, and this would, to be clear, never happen in a million years, but if there was a core contributor group that was interested in how do we keep bitcoin relevant? You would have native bitcoin on multiple networks. You would have some sort of like cosmos esque bitcoin oracle network that would be able to sort of manage the distribution of bitcoin out to multiple areas. And it's kind of funny because in some ways that's a little bit between TBTC and wormhole. That is sort of what you guys are trying to do, just without the blessing of the core contributors.
00:39:11.336 - 00:39:34.104, Speaker B: Spot on. What else would you do? You would have a tiny tail emission and you would have part of your fee model burning BTC so that it ended up balancing out. Absolutely. And I think like earlier I said bitcoin life raft. That is like the most incredibly arrogant. I don't, I don't need to build bitcoin a life raft. Like, I think it's going to continue to be bitcoin no matter what I do.
00:39:34.104 - 00:40:03.546, Speaker B: But I do, I do want to make sure that stays relevant across our space and I don't want it to just become the one over financialized. Like, oh, yeah. Oh, I bought some bitcoin. Oh, you mean the ETF? No, that's not what I mean. That's the, you know, the real opposite of, like, non custodial is this, like, over financialization, where it's like. Because there's nothing cool to do with bitcoin on chain. Everyone just learns about the stock market and trading these fights.
00:40:03.650 - 00:40:37.644, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like the biggest onboarding that Robinhood ever had was bitcoin. And it wasn't for the sake of bitcoin. It was that people started buying bitcoin, and then they were like, what more interesting stuff can I do? And then they discovered options trading. It's kind of funny, but the way we talk about it is so zero sum because even you say, like, oh, a life raft for bitcoin. That is a totally valid analogy. But the other slight spit on that is maybe what bitcoin actually needs is a container ship, because right now its an economy that has zero inflows and outflows.
00:40:38.344 - 00:41:16.844, Speaker B: The funny thing about this particular moment, mentioning zero inflows and zero outflows, is our work making bitcoin more useful. I struggle to say that it will bring more people to the space. I dont think thats what ill do. I think its like the way that I look at this. Im considering pulling a whiteboard into the video, but it might be a little bit too much. The way that I look at this is you have this funnel, and today, lets say the top of the space for all of crypto is coinbase finance or whatever. Maybe its something like fold, or maybe its something like river or swan.
00:41:16.844 - 00:41:52.076, Speaker B: Then you go down. If youre looking at as a bitcoin holder, like the next level down is, maybe it's like moving your bitcoin to a ledger. And then there might be one more level down, which is like running a lightning node. But then you look at the other way that people go. And I think what often happens is you buy bitcoin on one of these things, then you're like, oh, my God, look at all these other tickers. Then you buy all these other things, and then slowly you find your way on chain, and you're like, okay, so now I've got phantom or metamask and, and then I go down, and now I'm on uniswap. And then you go all the way down.
00:41:52.076 - 00:42:32.444, Speaker B: You're like, okay, now I'm nine x leverage doing some weird interest rate arb, and there's just a lot more. But it's all in our space. And so I think that's what I really want to see with bitcoin is like, it's a really poor outcome for me for people to buy bitcoin and leave and just leave it sitting versus all of these other places where their lives could be impacted. And, I mean, I guess I just named a lot of financial products, so I promise there are other ways. But, you know, so I think that's what I really want to see with TBTC is to make that funnel deep and interesting and to basically completely slay it as pet rock meme.
00:42:32.744 - 00:42:48.944, Speaker A: Okay, I want to ask you kind of a little bit more of an existential question here. This is very popular David Hoffman tweet, which is something along the lines of, crypto wasn't invented to make you rich, it was invented to set you free.
00:42:49.244 - 00:42:49.984, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:50.524 - 00:43:23.104, Speaker A: First off, I think on its face, great statement. We can all sign up for that. So why is everyone so worried about the price? Fundamentally, every time you talk to someone about bitcoin, the thing that they're focused on is the price of bitcoin. It feels like there's a, there's a, how do I put this? There's a duality here where it's like, it feels like, because the only thing bitcoin can do is go up and down. That's the only thing anyone ever talks about about bitcoin. Whereas, like, the more. And yes, there's all this, like, oh, is ETH going up? A soul going up?
00:43:23.184 - 00:43:23.616, Speaker B: Sure.
00:43:23.720 - 00:43:44.174, Speaker A: And like, at the end of the day, like Solana and Ethereum are smart contract networks that are designed to be used. They're not designed to be held. And sort of like, where do you see the interplay there between usability and this abstract concept of freedom?
00:43:44.794 - 00:44:04.756, Speaker B: Yeah, so that is a great question. Okay, so let me get the cheap responses out of the way so we can get to the good stuff. So, cheap response. Oh, well, that's not the true bitcoin. That's not. So theres like a no true Scotsman thing, I think, where people say, well, a hole that you know about bitcoin is going up and down. You havent really bought bitcoin.
00:44:04.756 - 00:45:18.484, Speaker B: Youve bought an entry and a ledger somewhere, and theyre still controlling you. Yada, yada, yada. So, look, if youre listening to this podcast, youve heard that. Weve all heard that. The truth is theres a serious trade off between freedom and, I mean, individual liberty and consequences, and people want to be free to make their own choices, but it is difficult to remember that that means you will suffer the consequences of those choices. And so, I mean, the way that I would like to see the world and the way that if I have my druthers, like, where we're pushing the pendulum of history is toward more personal responsibility. It's toward more planning, it's toward thinking about yourself and your family and recognizing that the political situation around you can change very quickly, recognizing that, no, like, you were very lucky to be born, say, in the US, but that doesn't mean that you're never going to have a hard time.
00:45:18.484 - 00:45:33.582, Speaker B: So I think that it's now taking a totally different tech. People didn't really use signal for a long time in the industry. We did. And then a lot of security people did, but it wasn't widespread.
00:45:33.638 - 00:45:35.646, Speaker A: But my normies are on signal now.
00:45:35.790 - 00:45:38.794, Speaker B: Right, but normies are on signal now. Do you remember what happened?
00:45:40.054 - 00:45:40.794, Speaker A: No.
00:45:41.414 - 00:46:16.766, Speaker B: Bunch of protests in the US. So over, I mean, since really since like a little pre Trump to now, this mix of like, you know, like Black Lives Matter and anti roe and all of these things started leading to more and more normies going to protests. And they're like, what should I do if I go to a protest? They're like, oh God, you got a download signal. And. Right. And I think that in some ways, our space, one version of our space is signal. It doesnt matter until you need it.
00:46:16.766 - 00:46:51.024, Speaker B: And then suddenly half of the economy moves over because theyre going to a protest or because there was a breakdown. So thats the bitcoin view of the space. And I think theres also a techno optimist view of the space, which I think is what a lot of smart contract chains are building toward. And the truth is, I want to see both. Right. I want to see that if you are being oppressed, that you have another option and that you have an escape valve. But I also want to see us build a world thats more equitable and fair and efficient from the ground up.
00:46:51.024 - 00:47:07.824, Speaker B: And I think that we can do both those things. I think thats probably the difference between me and a lot of bitcoin only people. And thats also probably the difference between me and a lot of smart contract folks. A lot of them think theyre building the future. And I think, well, that's part of what we're doing. The other part is we're defending what people already have.
00:47:08.124 - 00:47:13.384, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that makes a lot of sense that your life has led you to threshold debt.
00:47:15.044 - 00:47:29.264, Speaker B: So we've talked a lot about TBTC, and obviously, I've gone my orange pelled laser eyes. I've gotten some of that out of my system. But I guess it's worth talking a little bit about the threshold merge as well, because I recognize that it's uncommon.
00:47:29.584 - 00:48:10.430, Speaker A: Yeah, the merge is fascinating because, like, I think there's a world where, like, look, everything is obvious in hindsight. That's one of the truisms of the technology industry. But there is a real world where, like, I am old enough to remember when the bitcoiner said lightning was the devil, right? And this sort of idea that, like, two networks that are doing ancillary things that are not quite the same things could come together and actually literally go through a decentralized merger, how did that come about? And talk to me a little bit about how that actually resulted in threshold on the other end.
00:48:10.582 - 00:48:44.990, Speaker B: It's been surprising, actually. Bison trails played a role, too. Don't worry how this happened. So keypad built TBTC, and v one was out. The world was using it, and we were looking at v two. We're asking ourselves, like, what compromises can we make and what changes can we make to make this thing way too difficult to use in b one for stakers, but also just for depositors. How can we make it simple? So, as we were working on this, we heard about another network that was considering, like, another team, really, because networks don't consider things.
00:48:44.990 - 00:49:26.864, Speaker B: We heard about another team that was considering launching a incredibly decentralized bitcoin backed token. And that was the decipher tune. And so the funny thing about keeping Nucypher is we were always kind of frenemies, so we had a lot of mutual respect for each other. And we had similar people who we would call out in the space who were examples of folks who like to say, oh, decentralization, or whatever the technical signing buzzword was that they might not follow through and actually build. And so both teams had a lot of respect for each other, and we also had a lot of community members in common. We had bison trails in common. We had just some investors.
00:49:26.864 - 00:49:54.802, Speaker B: So we had a lot of people in common. And when we heard that this team was considering doing this token, I started getting concerned. It's easy to be like, we have to be the only. It's easy to just get very defensive when you hear about competitors. And my thoughts around a new cipher like bitcoin token was a couple of things. One, it's like, oh, they could actually do it. They could actually do it well.
00:49:54.802 - 00:50:23.124, Speaker B: And the other was that, why would we waste our energy building these competing things when we could build one. So some community members actually reached out and connected me and McClain. One of them was flipping Bryson trails. We had a couple others on discord. Victor Bunyan, I'm guessing Victor, indeed. Yeah. So Victor and then a few other shared members reached out and they actually kind of brokered a call between me and McWane.
00:50:23.124 - 00:50:53.438, Speaker B: I will admit that first call, I did have a little bit of whiskey. I'm not much of a drinker. But it was just, it was a strange call and a strange time. But, you know, I think what we both did, and I think oftentimes how when something goes from competition to cooperation, how it works is you just have this mutual decision to put all your cards on the table. And we already knew, look, we have these committee members who have been telling us to find a way to work together, service providers, investors. So let's just put our cards on table. So we did.
00:50:53.438 - 00:51:27.760, Speaker B: And I said, look, this is what we're doing. I've heard you guys are doing this. Is there a way for us, I think I was the first one to say, is there a way for us to do this together and to offer the off of the branch? So what happened after that got really weird. Right. If this were a private m and a, there would be board discussions and relationships between shareholders and all of these other components that the market has sort of figured out how to do. Right. So it's like, oh, you have your investment bankers and you have your advisories and there's just an entire ecosystem that's been built.
00:51:27.760 - 00:51:28.016, Speaker B: Sure.
00:51:28.040 - 00:51:32.552, Speaker A: It's usually even laid out in the founding investment documents and corporate charter.
00:51:32.608 - 00:51:59.756, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly, exactly. So you have all this stuff and it's like everyone knows a little bit about it. If nothing else, they've seen something on tv. Right. But for what we were doing, we had no clue. There were a few things that we made clear and then we started moving into larger and larger community discussions. So one of them was that we knew from Nucypher's side there, and this was from their team, and it became a community thing from their team.
00:51:59.756 - 00:52:27.768, Speaker B: They said, there will be no token holder left behind if we do something like this. It has to always be possible for anyone to opt in or to opt out. So that's pretty weird. And it makes sense, like, no one wants to miss a snapshot. You don't want people who are on an exchange to get messed, whatever. But that was the first constraint and then the one that I pushed and really that Ole keep pushed was we want to be treated as equals. We do not care what the price is between these two assets.
00:52:27.768 - 00:53:07.886, Speaker B: That is completely irrelevant to what we're doing. If we are going to create a new network where anyone from either old network can migrate over, then the price is irrelevant and it should be 50 50. And then what that became is me and McLean were like okay, cool. Both of these are hard for a variety of reasons, but lets do it. And we each wrote proposals and then at that point it became the beginnings of the threshold down. So people from each side would write proposals on the new cipher side and write proposals on the keep side and they iterated and they iterated and iterated. And I think the incredible thing is that they ended up stopping iterating on something that they were happy with.
00:53:07.886 - 00:53:57.842, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but things that I've learned just because you have a decentralized network doesn't mean that someone's not going to step up. And you know, when something needs to get done there are still people and there are still community members that have to step up and actually do it. For me and McLean we had to have that first call. But then after that most of the postals weren't us and people put aside their time to write them and kind of think through the mechanism. Other things that we've learned if someone else were doing one today, it's kind of remarkable that neither team or community built a lot of accountability into this system. So we didn't build in anyway for either person, either group to earn in. We didn't build KPI's or milestones or anything like that.
00:53:57.842 - 00:54:20.204, Speaker B: What we relied on instead is, well, anyone can always opt out by downgrading to the original token. I think that's also interesting. We set it up so that either group could exit, but we didn't set up the various KPI's I've seen in traditional m and a. Yeah, all very weird.
00:54:20.364 - 00:54:41.396, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. So I guess my question would be, do you think the ability to exit was real? Like this is the thing you hear all the time is like just because someone like I technically have the ability to opt out of the US dollar financial system, but I practically don't.
00:54:41.580 - 00:55:31.886, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I think at the beginning the ability to exit in a merge like this was really important because if there weren't an economic majority in the state token, it's just you just created a new token and that's it. But I think that the more I really haven't seen any people use that other than right at the beginning. And I think the longer we go without people using it, the less and less and less likely it is that people ever would. Right? Because eventually it's like, okay, well, the new asset, people know, and at some point, people will have never heard of keep them. I've never heard of Noom. And exchanges delist things and say, and they tell their users these things have merged. And so it's like, even though we left that ability to exit for people on chain, a lot of people off chain exchanges had to make decisions.
00:55:31.886 - 00:55:57.834, Speaker B: Maybe they listed all three. Maybe they combined their order books into one. They did all sorts of weird stuff, and we didn't really have any guidance for them because this was the first time we had seen this done on chain. So maybe that ability to access it wasn't real, but it definitely, in the first three, four months, was absolutely something that anyone could have basically used to kill merge.
00:55:58.534 - 00:56:08.814, Speaker A: Well, Matt, I think that's about all the time we have today. Thanks for coming on and chatting about bitcoin and watching threshold and the crazy journey that got you.
00:56:09.354 - 00:56:11.394, Speaker B: Oh, thank you, Austin. Really appreciate you having me.
