00:00:03.560 - 00:00:24.674, Speaker A: Long time no see. I am Ben Sparango. I am the head of BD at Solana Labs, joined here today by some of the folks both in infrastructure, in the Solana ecosystem as well as the Defi ecosystem to talk about how institutions are coming to Defi. So to start, I'll open it up, let everybody introduce themselves and their project.
00:00:25.514 - 00:00:48.134, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Marius. I'm the co founder of Hubble Protocol. It's a protocol where you can take loans against bitcoin ETH Sol in a stable coin called USDH, which you can then take and buy more bitcoin to leverage up, or you can take it to Camino Finance, which is the place where you can earn yield on market making vaults based on stablecoin exposure only.
00:00:50.194 - 00:00:50.554, Speaker C: Sure.
00:00:50.594 - 00:01:01.994, Speaker D: So I'm Mike Milneso, head of sales for Europe, Middle east and Africa over at Copper. For those that don't know is we started off first and foremost as a custodian, and that's evolved to be a broader safeguarding and trading infrastructure provider.
00:01:03.094 - 00:01:31.424, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Oye Omer. I lead product strategy for web3 in fireblocks. So Fireblocks is the biggest custody solution provider for financial institutions. We deal with a whole range of customers from traditional banks that we just launched with BNY, all through providing infrastructure for web3 companies and some of the more ambitious projects out there. So happy to be here.
00:01:32.284 - 00:01:42.944, Speaker E: My name is Oliv. I'm the co founder and CEO of friction. Friction is a Solana Defi protocol that builds portfolio management legos, or strategies that sit across the risk reward curve of Defi.
00:01:43.924 - 00:01:54.354, Speaker F: Hi, everyone, my name is Will Barnes, co founder and CEO, Jet Protocol. Jet is a fixed rate, fixed term borrowing protocol built on an order book.
00:01:55.414 - 00:02:16.994, Speaker A: Thanks, guys. So, to kick it off, I want to talk about institutions and what that means to everybody here. People have different definitions of what institutions coming to DeFi means. So would love for each of you to just touch on what does an institution mean to you? Who are those players and how you're interfacing with them?
00:02:18.054 - 00:03:08.504, Speaker B: I mean, for us, institutions is just by definition, not retail people that have money to invest on behalf of someone else most of the times. So we talk to, we try to figure out who can use Hubble and Camino, and we try to reach out to funds and other investors and see who can they recommend. Who is this product for? And the best, you know, the best client, we thought would be, you know, hedge funds that are crypto native, that, you know, have interest from outside traditional investors. They want to have some crypto exposure. And most of them, when we talk to them, they say, you know, we have some stable coins. We have a mandate that we can invest some stable coins, earn some yield on them we can deploy. But, you know, we need to do all the due diligence and make sure we stay on stable, stablecoin exposure only.
00:03:08.504 - 00:03:20.124, Speaker B: So it's Defi funds or VC's which have a defi strategy also like a liquid fund, and they do some farming. This is our kind of. These are our connections.
00:03:21.784 - 00:04:04.714, Speaker D: Sure. So, I mean, I think we've all been sat on panels now for years saying, you know, institutional capital's coming, institutional capital's coming, and, you know, it's pretty much on every single one of these things. And I think the truth is it's really only, and it comes down to your definition, of course, which I'll come on to, but it's only really happening now, at least in our opinion, over the course of the last six, nine, maybe twelve months or so, that you are seeing the traditional buy side players really weighing in and go past that testing stage of, we've got 100, 200 grand in this thing, and they're really now starting to deploy serious capital, more so on the centralized side, not so much in defi right now, but yeah, for us, that's the real definition. Then, of course, you've got the crypto native version, which is your standard crypto native hedge fund with five to 100 million AUM prop firms, VC's, as were mentioned, and so on and so forth.
00:04:05.774 - 00:04:27.098, Speaker C: Yes. I mean, so I have to agree, I think. But when we talk about institutions, it's not like a one size fits all. There are many types of institutions with different risk appetites, with different portfolio, and actually different expertise when it comes to actual trading. Right. It depends on their background, but what we see is a wide range. Right.
00:04:27.098 - 00:05:21.524, Speaker C: For us, eventually, we want to give them the ability to pursue any strategy, any investment strategy that they like, maybe centralized, like CFI through exchanges or DeFI through protocols. So, I mean, you want to give them the entire range of actually pursuing their strategy and make sure that they can easily and securely just like implement that strategy and execute on it. For us, I think it's like the main, I guess I wouldn't say focus, but one of the main challenges is to go out to these ecosystems and understand and how we look at all the different very ambitious protocols and give our customers a way to execute on that and tie that all to one ecosystem. So I think that's what we're seeing.
00:05:22.584 - 00:05:51.834, Speaker E: Yeah, I think some good points made so far. The way I think we bucket it in three categories generally, is you have crypto curious institutions, crypto native institutions, and then Defi native institutions. So as we try to dive in on the institutional side, one thing that's really important to us is the guiding principle of risk. So what is the risk profile of the institution? How much capital are they looking to deploy? What level of risk are they willing to take? And then how do they isolate smart contract risk in their traditional portfolio management or strategy management policies? And a big focus for us is trying to bridge that gap.
00:05:51.874 - 00:05:52.050, Speaker A: Right?
00:05:52.082 - 00:06:05.294, Speaker E: You need custodial solutions like copper and fire blocks. You need reporting solutions that don't really exist in DeFi today. So a lot of it is on kind of one off basis, as Omer mentioned, but a ton of work we have to do to make the onboarding smooth for them.
00:06:06.954 - 00:07:14.344, Speaker F: I think of institutions mostly as people who trade professionally for their job, not retail, or people who just day trade, generally someone who's formed a company and they sign up with exchanges and arbitrage and all kinds of stuff like that. But typically they are doing this for a full time job. And we've been thinking mostly about pretty small institutions, I would say firms to do like, or individual traders who do $5 million of volume weekly, which is pretty, actually pretty substantial amount of volume for a trader on DeFi. But then as you go up the stack, if you have a big bank, that's going to be an integration that takes years. And there's just fundamentally different institutions from a big bank to a startup. A big bank is funded perpetuity almost, and startup, very scrappy and small, big mismatches and potential integrations. And yeah, we think about that when we approach integrations as well.
00:07:15.324 - 00:07:41.084, Speaker A: So when institutions are coming to each of you, you guys are in, the three of you are DeFi applications, the two of you are custodial providers. You are being approached with different questions from these institutions. So starting with the custodial providers, Mike or Omer, just when an institution approaches you guys, what's important to them? Why are they coming to you, and why are they using your services?
00:07:42.384 - 00:08:27.098, Speaker D: Sure. So on our side, we usually want the first point of contacts for that question of what don't we know? Like, these institutions haven't really dabbled in defi yet. They are moving in, and they just want to understand the broader scope of where is the risk? What have you seen go wrong in the past? How can we mitigate against that? What is best practice? And then how do we wrap not only the risk analysis component around that, but the governance piece as well. I mean, fundamentally we are still operating in an asset class that is anonymous with very little path for recourse. So every part of the conversation has got to be grounded in that context. So for us it really is a broad statement. If they don't have specific questions, they're not asking EVM versus non EVM, they're going big picture, how do we protect the assets? And then from there we can generate alpha afterwards.
00:08:27.098 - 00:08:30.094, Speaker D: But it's getting comfortable and putting governance around all of this.
00:08:30.574 - 00:08:30.934, Speaker F: No.
00:08:30.974 - 00:09:34.550, Speaker C: So I definitely agree. I think that there's a first question of why Defi, how defi, how do we do that? How do we make it secure? How do we put the controls in, let's say on evms? How do I not give an approved for infinite amount of this token to that protocol that I don't know what's going to happen in the future. So these are the basic security questions that, that come up. But I think for the more defi native funds, it's always about how do you get more protocols? They're always leading the pack, always saying ok, so when is this change? Like what chain, can you repeat that? It's like ok, we'll go out and check it out and see. They're always pushing the envelope on all these because they want to utilize the security they want to utilize. They want to have one system in which they manage all their funds and deploy from there. But then on the other hand, they always keep pushing the envelope on more and more chains and more and more protocols.
00:09:34.550 - 00:09:37.950, Speaker C: So I guess it's both of these.
00:09:38.062 - 00:09:50.200, Speaker A: Sure. To quickly double down on that. I think both of you have products by which you make it easier for your clients to utilize deFi. So copper s, copper Connect Fireblocks has a similar product.
00:09:50.302 - 00:09:59.028, Speaker C: Yeah. So the extension and also our wallet connect integration and our Defi SDK, which you can actually automate stuff programmatically with DeFi.
00:09:59.156 - 00:10:17.284, Speaker A: So can you explain like the design considerations around that and why a large Aum institution would be more inclined to utilize your product to interface with DeFi than like custodying their own assets and interfacing directly from a ledger or a phantom wallet?
00:10:17.624 - 00:10:41.272, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, so that's kind of an easy question in that regard. Right. So do you want to utilize like I think both copper and fireblocks, right. We provide like a highly secure and very flexible system to actually operate on. So you want to utilize first our security protocol and then our governance. Right. In terms of who needs to sign what, at what amount and which day and all of that.
00:10:41.272 - 00:11:42.080, Speaker C: So you would need to want to put that governance, they want to take all these, let's say, treasury management type of setup that went through the CFO and the CISO of the company to make sure that no one's going to run off with anything that they're not supposed to, and eliminating a single point of failure. So they take that as the default. This is where we need to originate all our transactions from. And then from there they just go, okay, so how do you make that easy for us to actually go out and do that? So in an iterative manner, we just build more and more. And as I've said, even the Defi native institutions, they're actually more grant. They don't need, like, at some points, they don't even need like a metamask like experience for their traders. They actually automate all those stuff with like, using programmatic access, right? Super savvy, super smart, trying to do yield generation on top of multiple DeFi protocols.
00:11:42.080 - 00:11:45.696, Speaker C: So you need to provide that access as well. So it's like this whole range of.
00:11:45.720 - 00:12:24.860, Speaker D: Experience, and I think actually very similar to what you've mentioned there. There's that whole governance piece, right? It's fundamentally, who can add a whitelist to a new smart contract? Who's doing the audit for that? What are the permissions, et cetera, that you can layer on top of the team and then actually going a step further than this. Okay, let's say we do all the governance, but it turns out fundamentally we were wrong. We're interacting with a contract that has malicious code, whatever it may be, and something goes wrong. How can you then segregate that environment to at least put a backstop on your maximum loss, so to speak, should something go wrong. So one thing that we've been working on and released quite recently is actually segregated environments per protocol. So, for example, let's say you've been in Defi for a while, you're comfortable with EVM chains, et cetera.
00:12:24.860 - 00:12:40.934, Speaker D: You can have one segregated environment, no single point of failure, et cetera, there, and you can have that team with one set of permissions. But then let's say you then move to non EVM Solana, whatever it may be. And fundamentally, you can put a more cautious structure and governance around this with less capital and keep those two things entirely segregated.
00:12:41.314 - 00:12:42.174, Speaker F: Got it.
00:12:42.554 - 00:12:53.646, Speaker A: And then moving over to the DeFi teams, I'll start with you, Will. When you guys are interfacing with institutions, what are the things. What are the questions that they're surfacing to you guys? And how are you guys building products to better serve those needs?
00:12:53.770 - 00:13:49.264, Speaker F: Yeah, they're usually, most are pretty sophisticated, and they know more than they could talk to blockchain about you with you, but they don't actually understand what the protocol does, what a DeFi protocol does. But I think that's even common among people who are in DeFi are like, when you look at a protocol at face value, you're not really sure what it does. You have to really dig in the docs because they do really esoteric stuff. It helps. I found, especially for a credit fund, just in particular, like, if you can explain it and say, with this protocol, with our protocol, you can remove all your loan servicing costs, because they understand that immediately think, okay, saving costs here. And then you can just add things like quick settlement. You can access it a continuous market at any time, and then it handles everything thereafter for you if it needs to liquidate.
00:13:49.264 - 00:14:18.342, Speaker F: And like, for them, when they do a lot of manual paperwork, if they, I mean, credit funds are pretty manual in general, they like that, and then they're attracted to it. Want to learn more about it. But of course, a big fun like that is slow moving. You have to sort of, you know, work it into the discussion. But they, like, they definitely always see the value. Yeah, it helps when you just explain, like, cost savings or like, how convenient it is for you. Yeah, that's also.
00:14:18.342 - 00:14:47.774, Speaker F: Convenience is one thing. Has to be convenient. And, yeah, there's always security. I think that is because they see the headlines, and they'll talk about the headlines when you talk to them. And you always have an answer for that. Always. The headlines are usually pretty sensationalist, but I think, all in all, they're really impressed with the level of dialogue between institutions nowadays compared to 2018, it's like night and day difference.
00:14:47.934 - 00:15:01.678, Speaker A: Yeah, it sounds like they're much more willing to work with us to find a common solution. And some of you guys are building products to service them. You guys just announced a product today. Would you like to touch on that?
00:15:01.806 - 00:15:40.718, Speaker E: Yeah, we're really excited to launch friction institutional today, which is what we think DeFI's real first attempt at onboarding institutional grade DeFi clients may not be DeFi native today, may not be crypto native today, may be very crypto curious, but very savvy in the traditional markets. We think this is a big unlock for DeFi because it enables a couple of things. All these people come to us, institutions come to us and ask for three things, really. They ask for security, they ask for risk management, and they ask for real yield. And to get them these three things requires a lot more than what most of DeFi offers today. We were talking about this behind is like there's no standardization of risk metrics in DeFi today. You need verified identity, you need on and off chain risk score tracking.
00:15:40.718 - 00:16:33.044, Speaker E: So the first product, under friction institutional, is going to be an institutional credit product, which brings under collateralized lending at a fixed rate, fixed term into DeFi with meaningful amount of lender protection, borrower diversification and duration risk management. We think without these things, the crypto credit markets will have a tough time scaling, particularly as we see treasury yields rise across the traditional world and DeFi starts to become uncompetitive, frankly. So we have a lot of work to do as DeFi platforms, as the people who onboard users into DeFi to build that experience and really build a relationship business out of this too. I think relationships are a big part of what Defi needs to scale. And a lot of us on stage here are working really actively to onboard some of the institutions who are kind of sitting at the fence and haven't really understood DeFi for what it is. So transparent risk management and real yield is something we think will drive the next big cycle of defi adoption from institutions.
00:16:33.744 - 00:16:34.176, Speaker F: Varys.
00:16:34.200 - 00:16:34.976, Speaker A: You want to touch?
00:16:35.120 - 00:17:21.694, Speaker B: Yeah. When we talk to institutions, they want to know what's the yield and what's the risk. Basically, you know, a lot of the times the yield advertise is not realized. You know, you can have like 20% today, but 3% tomorrow. So they want to see historical realized APR and they want to know what the risk is. And some of them, quite a lot of them, they go really deep into what testing framework they use. How many tests do you have on your codebase? How many audits? Can I see the audits? Is there a multisig, is there governance? How long have you been alive? Sorry? How long has the protocol been alive? Did you have incidents? They go really like, you know, very diligent into assessing this.
00:17:21.694 - 00:18:14.514, Speaker B: Some of them, you know, there's different levels of tolerance. They want to see how many users, you know, proof of, you know, like kind of like social proofing or like proof that you haven't been. There have been no incidents. And they want to see the code they, they send like their quant or their engineer to check out the code, you know, they, they don't, you know, they see the news, like you mentioned, you know, and they're like, don't want to be part of any, of any exploits. So this is number one. And after that they ask, okay, what's the product? How do you make, how do you earn any yield? And they want to deconstruct the yield between, you know, wherever there are fees. What are the emissions part? How long are the emissions going to last? And after that, once they're happy, you know, there's a long, long process.
00:18:14.514 - 00:18:37.512, Speaker B: We have multiple calls. They ask, who are the founders? What have you done before? It's really diligent. And then ultimately they start with like a small amount, they put a small amount, they check it out. They claim the yield, they give us feedback. And then if they're happy, which some of them are, they continue and they provide back feedback to us.
00:18:37.648 - 00:19:20.396, Speaker A: You brought up a great point. There is that one thing that has continually plagued crypto is just hacks. Software inherently has infinite unknown unknowns, and you're never going to be fully certain that something is rock solid and can't be manipulated in some way, either from a code level or from an economic perspective. So what are some ways that you guys are seeing people iterate on security measures, getting better audits, building in insurance funds to kind of build more consumer confidence? Because fundamentally, none of us want to put our assets into Defi protocols if there's a risk of you losing your principal. So whoever wants to go ahead.
00:19:20.500 - 00:20:00.274, Speaker B: Yeah, we've been thinking a lot about risk because we have been talking to these institutions and we realized that we added measures that literally mimic the things that are in traditional finance. Some of them are literally, you know, some of our people in our team used to work in traditional finance and say, look, this is what we did in the bank. And then we implemented it and we realized it makes so much sense. So we had things like, you know, withdrawal net withdrawal caps. So, you know, we limit the amount that can be taken out of the protocol or over four hour period, and then it gets reset. So even if there's an exploited list, it's capped. We're adding like, price bands on oracles.
00:20:00.274 - 00:20:27.064, Speaker B: I think SPF was mentioning that they do that on the risk engine. So if it's a stable coin, cap it at 1.5 and below 0.5, at least halt the protocol or halt deposits or things that could harm the protocol in case these things happen. So they're really traditional finance. We're a little bit reinventing the wheel, but a very fast space because it's just smart contract code. So we can test.
00:20:27.064 - 00:21:07.038, Speaker B: We have the feedback loop is quite fast. Yeah, that's it. And basically risk management. So we realized when we launched Hubble that we have to do risk management. We thought, we're writing a smart contract, but we have to think about volatility and liquidity and price drops and stuff like that. And more and more people, like, for example, gauntlet, are building these Monte Carlo simulations where you can predict or, like, with, like, 95% confidence, say what? What will happen in case, if this token drops by 30%, given the existing liquidity? Is your protocol at risk? Can you liquidate? Do you have enough, you know, liquidity on the x?
00:21:07.206 - 00:21:39.432, Speaker D: Yeah, Mike, and I think the point you raised there, Ben, I mean, that's fundamentally the obstacle to broader adoption, right, from the tradfi market that's moving in. I mean, it's kind of hedge fund 101. You take all the capital, hedge the principal, and generate alpha with whatever strategy you're running from there. And crypto is a very unique asset class insofar as you're almost risking 100% of the principal on every single transaction. Fundamentally, if you send this to the wrong wallet address, if you've got assets sitting on exchanges, smart contracts, whatever it may be, you've almost got this prevalent risk consistently running on that. So there are ways to solve it. On the centralized exchanges, that's something that we've done.
00:21:39.432 - 00:21:58.984, Speaker D: But on the DeFi side, I think that's where we have seen much lower adoption as compared to the centralized. Like, you can almost assess your credit risk. You can see what's going on. You can assess the balance sheet, etcetera, smart contracts, incredibly opaque, and there are very few people in the world that are truly capable of assessing that risk. So I think it's really hitting the nail on the head. But I'm sure you guys see similar.
00:22:00.244 - 00:23:20.750, Speaker C: There are actually two questions, right? I mean, how do DeFi protocols actually make sure that they're as secure as they can be from, like, I guess, a financial logical layer that they have in their background? And, like, how can investors or, like, institutions or retail protect themselves against, like, if something goes wrong, right? I mean, these are two. Those two carry the burden, like, different, right? So, for institutions, obviously, they need to have, like, a reliable wallet infrastructure that is secure and also allows them to kind of, you know, either pull their funds out when something happens or to have monitoring capabilities of, like, the DeFi protocols that they're in and make sure that they cut their losses on the chance that there's an exploit. So, again, putting your policies in place, making sure that you're not overexposed that everything that you do fit exactly the manifest of the portfolio and the risk management that you actually taken into consideration, that's on the institution side, on the customer side, on the defi side. Listen, maybe I have a little bit of a different. Of a, like, it's a different opinion. I think it's a rapidly evolving ecosystem. Like, where we were, like, two years ago is not even close to where we are right now in terms of, like, the range of the products that are being served.
00:23:20.750 - 00:23:52.682, Speaker C: You just spoke in, like, a real world asset panel. Right. I mean, we're constantly iterating, and those iterations, they're costly, right? I mean, but, like, they're failing fast and improving. And failing fast and improving will keep seeing. Unfortunately, we'll keep seeing some of these. But I think it's a price that you pay for innovation, and this whole space is just fueled on innovation and pushing the envelope and doing these types of things. So, yes, there is a price, but the gain in five to ten years will be amazing, the way that I.
00:23:52.698 - 00:23:56.522, Speaker A: See it, Udav, and will quickly, before we're wrapped up here.
00:23:56.618 - 00:23:56.802, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:23:56.818 - 00:24:32.590, Speaker E: I think the concepts about the policies need to be put in place by protocols. Like you all mentioned, protocols across defi that requires some element of standardization. I think what we find particularly interesting is the concept of insurance in DeFi. We think traditionally, friction's kind of core product has been around the concept of call and put options. Obviously, put options are a very good reflection of the price of insurance, if you can properly price them, that is. And something that we're particularly attracted by is the concept of insurance funds, which you alluded to. If you look at what the United States does as the Federal Depository Insurance Commission, the FDIC, they insure $9 trillion of assets with a deposit insurance fund of about 120 billion.
00:24:32.590 - 00:24:36.054, Speaker E: So it's like a 1.2% reserve ratio.
00:24:36.134 - 00:24:36.350, Speaker F: Right.
00:24:36.382 - 00:24:42.526, Speaker E: And this is responsible for essentially bailing out banks that are defaulting. Well, the thing about DeFi is we don't have a central governance structure like this.
00:24:42.550 - 00:24:42.686, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:42.710 - 00:24:49.614, Speaker E: That's kind of one of the value premises. So we're exploring a lot about building these things and always interested in chatting with folks who are in the same space.
00:24:49.774 - 00:24:56.414, Speaker A: We're unfortunately out of time. But thank you guys for joining us today, and thank you to the panelists for coming up here. Thanks.
