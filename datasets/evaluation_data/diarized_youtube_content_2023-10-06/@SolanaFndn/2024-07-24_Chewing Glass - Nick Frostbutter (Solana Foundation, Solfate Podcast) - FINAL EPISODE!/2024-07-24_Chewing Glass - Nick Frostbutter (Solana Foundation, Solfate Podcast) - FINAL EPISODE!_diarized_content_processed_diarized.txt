00:00:00.400 - 00:00:02.382, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other, we're not gonna make it.
00:00:02.486 - 00:00:07.478, Speaker B: Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew. Most of the time, I work in.
00:00:07.494 - 00:00:09.998, Speaker A: A glass jar and lead a very uneventful life.
00:00:10.134 - 00:00:20.070, Speaker B: A face full of glass hurts like hell when you're in it. That's weird. That glass looks half full to me. Eating glass. Eating glass is staring into the abyss. Glass. Who gives a shit about glass?
00:00:20.150 - 00:00:25.890, Speaker A: Who the fuck is this? It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass.
00:00:26.870 - 00:00:29.250, Speaker B: Gotta get some safety goggles next time.
00:00:38.850 - 00:01:04.950, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, and welcome to Chewing glass, the show where we talk to developers building the Solana ecosystem. Today is a very special and a very sad day. It is the final episode of Chewing Glass. It has been an incredible journey and a great time here, so thank you all. So we're going to end this with a special guest. I don't know how special he actually is. Nick Frostbutter.
00:01:04.950 - 00:01:19.626, Speaker A: He's a Dev rel for Solana foundation, and he's an incredible one at that. He has his own podcast called Sulfate Pod, and we'll talk more about that a little bit later. So let's kick it off. Nick, how is it going, man?
00:01:19.738 - 00:01:26.110, Speaker B: Gm, it's going well. Excited to be here, and I feel honored, truly honored to be the final guest of chewing glass.
00:01:26.600 - 00:02:00.220, Speaker A: Yeah, man, we've been, I think, two to two and a half years ago, roughly one. One person per episode or one person per month. So it's been great. And just because you have your own podcast, I think it was, like, fitting that, like, maybe we do a little torch passing around this, and because you're doing a lot of similar stuff to what I've been doing on chewing glass, except for some reason, you guys have doing a lot more guests than I have, which sounds like. Like a lot of work. It is, but cool. So let's kick it off, man.
00:02:00.220 - 00:02:01.600, Speaker A: How's everything going?
00:02:01.680 - 00:02:28.442, Speaker B: Things are going well. I have been basically fully invested and focused on blinks and actions. They just launched about a week ago to the public. The whole Solana community has been really about them. It's been really amazing to see people building super cool things and using the tools that, you know, some of us at Solana foundation put together, and then all the amazing things that dialect has put together, too. And it's just the whole community is running with it, and it's amazing.
00:02:28.626 - 00:02:42.290, Speaker A: Sweet. Let's dive into that here in a little bit. So let's, like, jumping back into, like, our normal, standard operating procedures here. At chewing glass, where we're very strict about these things and we were very serious people.
00:02:42.450 - 00:02:42.954, Speaker B: Make sense.
00:02:43.002 - 00:03:02.226, Speaker A: So, no. So I really want to learn about sort of like. Like, you're obviously a dev rel at Solana foundation. That happened in some way, but there's obviously a huge history before. There's a huge history before that. I don't know how huge of a history, but there is one. So let's figure out a little bit about Nick Frosty behind the scenes.
00:03:02.226 - 00:03:19.044, Speaker A: So just to start out, like, on the questioning, like, have you, or did you go to school for cs? What's your background? How did you get started? What was the origin story of Nick and his career? Just like, in general?
00:03:19.172 - 00:03:24.004, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I have an abnormal path in crypto for sure.
00:03:24.132 - 00:03:25.120, Speaker A: I'm not surprised.
00:03:26.940 - 00:03:52.300, Speaker B: So I don't have a college degree at all. I never studied computer science formally. I'm completely a self taught developer. I taught myself back in middle school 20 years ago now, and I've loved programming ever since. And instead of doing the common route that a lot of people that are passionate about computers do, they go to university and get a computer science degree. I joined the Navy instead. I joined the military.
00:03:52.300 - 00:04:15.730, Speaker B: I did about almost ten years in the US Navy. I was operating nuclear reactors and submarines, specifically maintaining a bunch of electrical equipment as a nuclear electrician, went through a bunch of education and certifications through, like you would imagine for all of that, and then eventually transition out of the military into Solana full time, and been at the Solana foundation ever since.
00:04:16.510 - 00:04:19.390, Speaker A: So how long were you actually in the Navy?
00:04:19.510 - 00:04:23.890, Speaker B: It was about nine and a half years is when I was in. So I round up to about ten.
00:04:24.270 - 00:04:27.086, Speaker A: Wow, that's a nice tour of duty you had there.
00:04:27.158 - 00:04:27.486, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:27.558 - 00:04:37.260, Speaker A: So while you were in the Navy, you were teaching yourself to code? Or, like, when did, like, what point? And, like, in your. In the last, like, nine years or whatever, had you taught yourself to code?
00:04:37.560 - 00:05:27.508, Speaker B: Like I said, it started back in middle school and high school, so I was young teenager teaching myself how to code a lot of YouTube videos, articles and stuff online. Started with PHP and learned some java. I know you're quite fond of Java, then. When I actually joined the Navy, I basically had zero free time on my hands to do anything programming. I tried to dabble with it a little bit here and there. When I was actively on my submarine, when I was stationed in Hawaii, I was, you know, it varied week to week, deployments and things, and then even non deployments, working hundred hour weeks, a lot of the times doing assorted equipment overhauls and things didn't have a whole lot of free time. And what free time I did, I tried to get some sleep, and a couple of years ago when I, after I left Hawaii, I left my boat to a different, different location where I'm at now.
00:05:27.508 - 00:05:56.710, Speaker B: And I was running like a training simulator there. I had a lot more free time. So I basically, the first chance I got, dove back into code, relearned a bunch of software development things, picked up all the new hot frameworks. There's new ones that come out every week, it seems. And I tried to learn Vue js react and really dove into the JavaScript ecosystems and then dabbled with some other languages and then eventually just kind of stumbled in the Solana. And then here we are.
00:05:57.370 - 00:06:58.484, Speaker A: Yeah. The crazy part about, like, doing chewing glass is like, the amount of people that have come through here, like, we just had, like, we have like, cloak dev, like, obviously. Who's come through here? Dean from like, Solana Turbine, WBA just came through here. Like, a lot of these guys and Carlos as well from Juicer. So many people in Solana ecosystem, from what I've seen, not all of them, obviously, but a lot of them, at least the ones who were coming onto the show, have interesting backgrounds, and none of them were formally trained, like, in software, just like a lot of people who, just like, I mean, Carlos was working in, he was doing wine photography, and then he was working in a cafe to teach himself to code, you know, and so there's, it's crazy that there's so many people like. Cause whenever I was, I'm an old man, but back, you didn't do that. Whenever I was in school, like, you went to, you went to school for these things because it was impossible to get jobs in that way.
00:06:58.484 - 00:07:22.726, Speaker A: So, yeah, you have an interesting thing because when we, when we talk about this stuff, we talk about people sort of like career history. And your career history is essentially nine years in the navy doing stuff with nuclear weapons. And then Solana, which is nuclear reactors, not nuclear weapons. Nuclear. Well, they power them. Let's it agree to disagree. No, but anyways, like, so let's, let's talk about that.
00:07:22.726 - 00:07:53.214, Speaker A: So we'll, we'll just dive into this stuff. I remember one day, me and Jacob, Jacob Crete had to develop a relations. We're talking and we were just talking about like, the docs need help desperately. They hadn't been touched, really truthfully updated and I don't know, since they were written, for the most part. Yeah, I remember just like, classic, the way that I just do this. I just sent out a tweet and I just said, who knows how to do documentation? And then you responded, I do. I do them for, like, nuclear reactors.
00:07:53.214 - 00:08:28.390, Speaker A: And I was like, probably do Solana. And I remember sharing that with Jacob, and I'm pretty sure he reached out to you. And so that's, that's kind of like the story there, but, yeah, like jumping, jumping back a little bit. Like before. Solana, like, what was your, what was your experience with crypto in general? Did you have any idea? Let's start in the lead up to how you ended up on crypto Twitter in the first place. What was your experience with general crypto? Bitcoin? Were you buying? Were you trading, what were you doing?
00:08:28.510 - 00:08:41.457, Speaker B: Yeah, my crypto story is I mined bitcoin on a laptop back in the day when that was still feasible, I lost the laptop. Don't have that anymore. Very sad to come to that realization.
00:08:41.593 - 00:08:42.297, Speaker A: One of those guys.
00:08:42.353 - 00:09:04.489, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It wasn't very many, but it was like maybe one or two at the time. And at the time of mining it, it was shortly after the bitcoin white paper came out. I was very convinced that the idea of a truly Internet, true Internet money has incredible power for the world in a lot of different ways. And I read, is that in hindsight.
00:09:04.529 - 00:09:06.620, Speaker A: Or did you actually, like, believe that?
00:09:06.660 - 00:09:32.150, Speaker B: No, no, I did. I did absolutely believe it. Like, it was. I mean, I believed it as much as, like, a high schooler could. You know, it's like, oh, this, this Internet money, it's something that, like, the, the idea of proof of work, being able to, like, run some software on your computer and be able to, like, earn money from it, like, that was very fascinating to me. I came, I come from, like, not a very wealthy background, very lower middle class upbringing. And, like, we didn't have any spare money to do anything.
00:09:32.150 - 00:10:09.276, Speaker B: So I was always trying to find different things to do on the Internet that I could, you know, I had access to a computer and not much else. It was a very crappy computer, which is why I learned software development things, trying to figure out how to make the computer better. Discovered Linux and all that and the. Yeah, so, like, the idea of, you know, Internet money that people can just use and they can get it without having to spend money necessarily, like, directly, that was a very interesting idea. So I tried mining it, mined some, and at the time, it was worth like a couple of pennies or something. And I was like, oh, cool. This laptop ran for like two months straight, and I got four pennies.
00:10:09.276 - 00:10:37.990, Speaker B: Like, you're like, okay, whatever. And then I kind of, like, forgot about it and didn't really try to push forward with anything there. I remember I used mountain Gox at one point, throwback. And the, and then, like, I finished high school, went out to the real world, got a job, and then eventually joined the Navy. And during my time in the navy was when, like, ethereum became a thing. Had no idea. I didn't see anything.
00:10:37.990 - 00:11:17.090, Speaker B: I had, like, I kind of alluded to earlier, didn't have a whole lot of free time, didn't have a whole lot of Internet access. You know when you're in a giant metal tube under the water, 10,000 leagues under the sea, we don't have Internet on that. So I basically saw nothing crypto for several years. And then when I got transferred out of Hawaii off my boat, I dove back into all things tech, and blockchain and crypto were kind of popping off. It was right around February of 2020, which, like Covid and everything, everyone had a lot more free time. And crypto was really popping off in a lot of different ways. And I started doing some research into what was new.
00:11:17.090 - 00:12:00.908, Speaker B: I actually started following you, and you were doing some Twitter spaces at the time of, like, what is Solana? Why is it different? And I was trying to research of, like, what's the difference between all these different blockchains? I had made some Internet friends that were doing a, I don't know if I call it a startup, but they were doing, like, a crypto project that was in the arbitrum ecosystem. They were originally thinking for Polygon, and they did it in arbitrum. It was basically like a game. And I was trying to figure out how to build blockchain applications and write a smart contract. And then I realized, holy crap, this is really expensive on EtH Mainnet. This just is out of reach for a lot of people still. At the time, it was out of reach for me as well.
00:12:00.908 - 00:12:27.526, Speaker B: I didn't deploy anything. I did a lot of front end stuff, which is why I dove more into all things front end and started getting more accustomed to the front end development side. And, yeah, sometime around there, I had met some crypto friends. I actually got to meet one of them in person for the first time this year at ETH Denver, which was really fun. We had been, like, adjacent Internet friends and acquaintances, I guess, for a couple of years. Finally got to meet him in person. It's always fun.
00:12:27.526 - 00:12:56.476, Speaker B: And I was just trying to figure out what was going on. And, like I said, I'd been following you for a little while. A lot of Twitter spaces, a lot of research. I remember a Twitter space with, I think it was you and Raj and some other people, and I riffing on, like, why I saw in a different. And I was like, ooh, fast and cheap. That's, you know, that's appealing for a lot of ways. And then there's that faithful tweet that you put out one day of who wants to help out with documentation? And then I think my actual response was something to the effect of, I like docs.
00:12:56.476 - 00:13:07.470, Speaker B: I can help. And we just started talking, and you were like, you should talk to Jacob. And I'm like, who's Jacob? I don't know who this is. And now Jacob has been my full time, immediate manager for year and a half now.
00:13:08.130 - 00:13:32.730, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. I love these origin stories. They're always, like, super cool to, like, hear how this happens, and, like. And I always try to, like, point this stuff out because there's, like, a lot of people, like, just getting into code or. Or maybe they've been coding for a while and thinking that they need to have all this crazy experience. But, like, sometimes it's just, like, a matter of raising your hand and saying, I like docs, and then, like, it can set your. And then you get that job.
00:13:32.730 - 00:14:08.510, Speaker A: You don't waste that opportunity, and. And you essentially, like, just work your way up into, like, doing some really cool stuff, which is obviously where you are right now. I'd like to maybe talk, like, just because, like, your. Your story's a little bit different. And, like, we don't have a, like, a ton of, like, history of, like, career to talk about. So, like, maybe we spend a little bit more time talking about, like, your initial. We'll get into, like, some of the other, like, newer stuff later, but, like, your sort of initial experience, like, coming into Solana as, like, not a formally trained background as an engineer, but somebody who knows how to code.
00:14:08.510 - 00:14:27.710, Speaker A: Then you come into Solana, and you start writing docs, and also along the way, you're probably building and figuring this out. What was the experience for you when you started and when you came into this whole thing? Because obviously, Devx is improving every day, but when you came here over a year ago, I don't know how has it been, like, a year and a half yet?
00:14:28.010 - 00:14:29.442, Speaker B: It's been almost two years now.
00:14:29.546 - 00:14:49.172, Speaker A: It's been almost two in the ecosystem. So two years ago, we've come a long way. Even though people don't really understand. Like, there's incremental changes, and you. You don't notice them because they happen slowly over time. But, like, when you joined, what was your experience like? Were you just like, holy shit, this is messed up. Like, everything from docs to whatever.
00:14:49.172 - 00:14:50.852, Speaker A: What was. What was that like for you?
00:14:50.916 - 00:15:12.938, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the experience was. Was rough, but it's. One of the things to understand is, like, how people learn, and, like, one of the ways that I've had to learn different ways. And I. My last three years in the navy, I was, like, technically an educator doing. I got trained on how to educate people. So I have a little bit of an understanding of how people learn, and I fully recognize the way that I learn.
00:15:12.938 - 00:15:48.836, Speaker B: It's from reading and doing, really, it's that doing part. It's building something, especially with code. It's build an application, build something that does a thing. So that's how I approached it. So when you had said, we need help with docs, I started reading the docs, and I was like, yeah, these are. These are kind of difficult to understand, especially for someone who doesn't have a lot of context of, like, what is blockchain and what is Solana specifically? There's a lot of assumptions that were baked into those docs written by who I now fondly know as the core engineers. And there was a lot of assumptions.
00:15:49.028 - 00:15:50.164, Speaker A: We'll just blame Trent.
00:15:50.212 - 00:15:54.876, Speaker B: We can just blame Trent. I mean, he's a great community manager. He does the Lord's work there.
00:15:54.988 - 00:15:56.000, Speaker A: He's incredible.
00:15:57.000 - 00:15:59.860, Speaker B: But, yeah, there's. I think it was actually Greg wrote a lot of them.
00:16:00.200 - 00:16:00.928, Speaker A: Yep.
00:16:01.064 - 00:16:01.740, Speaker B: The.
00:16:02.800 - 00:16:11.808, Speaker A: They didn't really teach you how to do anything. There's, like, lots of long form paragraphs about, like, what is this stuff? Versus, like, here's how you do some things.
00:16:11.944 - 00:16:33.366, Speaker B: Yeah, it was. It was very much like that. It was really deep, but still high level. Like, it didn't get into, like, it's like, the network level things, not the application layer of, like, hey, you're trying to build a product. You're trying to build a Dap or a smart contract, a program, whatever. You're trying to build a thing that people will use. That's not at all how the docs were structured at all.
00:16:33.366 - 00:16:47.078, Speaker B: And it was. It was really rough to go through them. They weren't organized well at all either. And so I was, like, trying to figure out how Solana works. I was. I had never looked at Rust ever before I started digging into the rust code base and.
00:16:47.254 - 00:16:48.478, Speaker A: Are you writing rust code now?
00:16:48.534 - 00:17:21.431, Speaker B: No, still not. I've written like one anchor program before. I read rust. I can like read Rust and figure out what's going on now, but I still haven't really had the time to learn to write it. But I still periodically dig into the agave code base to look at what's going on and help figure out why people are running into problems. I have all sorts of knowledge rattling around in my brain now about how recent block hashes work and why the error message you get doesn't really make sense, but it is there for a reason. Yeah.
00:17:21.431 - 00:18:13.352, Speaker B: So I started diving in, building some stuff and trying to figure out what could be better worked on updating a bunch of documentation and making it a little bit more clear for people to make it more approachable to people that are newer to the Solana ecosystem, and then started working on written guides and things of like, here's a direct tutorial on a jobs to be done sort of idea of like, you have a task you're trying to accomplish. Here's a tutorial, whether it's video or written, of like, how to do that thing. And after doing that for a couple of months, Jacob basically tried to hire me full time. And it was at that point when he realized I was actually in the military. And I was like, yeah, I can't really quit my job yet. And he's like, why not? You're in the US, you're an american, just quit your job. I'm like, ah, but like military and contracts and stuff, and take a court martial, it's fine.
00:18:13.352 - 00:18:49.650, Speaker B: I mean, don't recommend. So it was, it was a lot of fun, though, trying to figure out how the systems work and how to explain it to people. And like, you have to have at least a decent understanding of like, how to build a thing before you can adequately explain it to someone else. On how to build a thing, you need to, I truly believe you need to be able to like chew that glass, and that's the only way you're going to be able to explain the pain points and how to get around those pain points for people. And ideally, you fix those pain points so that way people don't hit the same problems you did. That's like development experience. That's a developer experience, rather.
00:18:50.030 - 00:19:20.370, Speaker A: So between the time you started roughly two years ago and now, like, what's the difference in our documentation? Because I've seen them, like, the experience of at least navigating and the content, it's a lot more readable. Somebody who isn't super heavy in depth technically can come through there and like learn how to build on Solana. So, like, what are the main differences from the documentation, from what they used to be to what you sort of like helped to get them to today?
00:19:20.830 - 00:19:59.372, Speaker B: I think probably the main differences would be that how they're structured and like how you can actually go through them now. They were kind of scattered. They weren't organized very well because they were all kind of like slapped in after the fact. And then as new things would get added, they would be slapped in as well. So we started going through and rearranging them and making it a little bit more clear, rewriting some of those really crusty pieces or some of the old pieces of content in there that were either just not true anymore because the salon of runtime had changed. There's maybe a new feature, RPC methods deprecated, that sort of thing. And then we also expanded on the docs, we added in other documentation within it.
00:19:59.372 - 00:20:43.778, Speaker B: Then also we have this idea on the Devrel team of the developer portal, developer hub, whatever you want to call it, Solana.com developers. It has not just the documentation, it has a bunch of information. There's a whole bunch of written articles and guides on how to develop random applications and how to do different things, both including front end stuff with JavaScript, and also rust, including native and Anchor. And so it's like collecting all of these things in one place where people can more easily find it, for one. And the big thing that has changed is that right now, the content is updated, it's up to date for what is valid and not deprecated on Solana, with a couple of exceptions, for the.
00:20:43.794 - 00:20:44.930, Speaker A: First time in history, for the first.
00:20:44.970 - 00:21:52.478, Speaker B: Time in a long time, I think that's one of the biggest things that I've seen change since I joined the ecosystem, is that there was a lot of content that people, and this still happens, but it's a very conscious thing that we're trying to help solve. A lot of people will create content in, whether it's a video or documentation, or a written guide published on medium or dev two or something, and they never go back to update it. It'll have old, outdated content which either just has deprecated functions that haven't been removed yet, so it still works. But a lot of the times it'll reference protocols that no longer exist because they shut down, or they rugged, or a protocol just changed their program, their deployed program. So people will go through these educational materials to figure out how it works. And then they hit so many friction points, so many roadblocks because the guide that they're following just does not work anymore. So by bringing a lot of that into this developer content hub, the Solana foundation dev rel team can help the ecosystem to keep it updated.
00:21:52.478 - 00:21:59.650, Speaker B: So that way new people as they come in, they don't keep hitting those same roadblocks. They can find new experience issues and then we can help solve those.
00:22:00.070 - 00:22:33.140, Speaker A: Yeah, that was really the hardest point, and especially in the earlier years, because you have metaplex, you have anchor. These guys are making changes and it's not their fault. They're trying to improve their product. But if you look at Ethereum, for example, things don't change very often. So the shelf life of a piece of content, like is years on Solana. In the earlier days, the shelf life of a contest could have been 24 hours, though, if like somebody shipped a change in one of these protocols, like the next day. That's just, and like, that's just the way that it was.
00:22:33.140 - 00:22:36.268, Speaker A: And it was horrible. It's greatly improved.
00:22:36.324 - 00:22:59.420, Speaker B: There's definitely benefits to like the immutable contract idea and the mutable contract idea. Like on one hand it's nice because like, you don't have those types of breaking changes, but on the other hand, from the developer experience perspective, it's like I can fix bugs in my program and then redeploy it in the updated code. But sometimes you deploy hello world at first and then you need to remove a bunch of instruction handlers.
00:22:59.880 - 00:23:57.564, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So the point that you were sort of just hitting on is like you were hired eventually full time, came out of the military, saw a tweet, came on as what we call external advocates, was sort of like this unofficial name for somebody who's doing some part time work for us. You were helping out with the docs, eventually got hired full time with the title or not, maybe not the actual title, but like you were coming on to do docs, now you're, now you. Within a short amount of time you were essentially like a full blown Devrel. So how has that sort of experience been? Like, I kind of want to touch on this, especially for some of these listeners that are like, there's a sort of debates happening right now and almost all the time is like, what the hell is Devrel do? And so you came on as a docs guy and like, that's part of what some Devrel does. But then you've gone on to like doing some of the portal stuff and like improving the developer experience. You do workshops, you do like, like the public sort of social media stuff to make people aware of these things.
00:23:57.564 - 00:24:11.566, Speaker A: So what's that, what's, what's that journey been like for you from just completely very little software experience to now being like a Devrel at Solana foundation? Like, it's, it's a, it's a big jump. And you do a lot more than just docs, obviously. Now.
00:24:11.708 - 00:24:54.176, Speaker B: Yeah, every week looks different, which I personally find very fun and interesting. Like we mentioned earlier, it's like blinks and actions are the hot thing right now. I'm doing a lot of work with that, workshops and SDKs and guides and docs and all of that, but it does vary. And, like, I've gotten this question a couple of times from people of, like, what is Devrel and what does Devrel do? And, like, my answer, I should probably write like a blog post about this because I keep getting asked, but my answer is like, honestly, it varies significantly based off of a couple of things. One, based off the organization and like, the ecosystem you're in, the technology you're using. Like, I am Dev rel at the Salana foundation. I'm not like Dev rel at Stripe.
00:24:54.176 - 00:25:28.156, Speaker B: Like, those dev rel role roles will look vastly different. The ideas are still the same. You're still trying to educate people and make their development experience better through education, through tooling and workshops and things like that. Documentation, but it looks different when you're trying to, like, at Solana foundation, we're trying to push the technology of Solana. We're not trying to sell a direct product. So, like, the way that you do that just looks different. And then also because the Solana Foundation Devrel team, like, we're trying to stay lean.
00:25:28.156 - 00:25:52.016, Speaker B: All of Solana foundation, like, our goal is to stay lean as possible. So we don't just hire people for one specific niche of Dev rel. Everyone is a jack of all trades. Everyone has focus areas. Mine initially started out as documentation and written content, and then we all kind of do documentation. Now we all do workshops. Everyone has a different focus.
00:25:52.016 - 00:26:12.498, Speaker B: I do a lot of front end stuff because that's what I have the most experience in. We have Jonas, who loves games and game development, has a decade or more of experience in game development. He focuses on games, things. I've never developed a game, so I don't ever touch that. So, like, each of us has, like, crossover and, like, crossover is good because we are all jack of all trades.
00:26:12.634 - 00:26:57.176, Speaker A: And now you have, now you have Bree, who's a rust expert. So, like, kind of like filling out, like, yeah, so, like the foundation Deverell is essentially advocating and showing people how to build on the core technology. Like advocating and like how to build on Solana generally. But like, there are protocols out there that have specific, like, that are hiring Devrel to build on their protocol and teaching people how to do that. But Solana Foundation Devrel is like, here's how you get started to build on Solana at like the core levels, like on Rust, on Anchor, on web3 js, and obviously like some new technologies like token extensions and blinks and actions as well, just like the things that are more broadly just this is the core of like Solana.
00:26:57.288 - 00:27:35.336, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like how to use the generics of the blockchain vice, like how to use a specific platform, like a specific product, like squads or jup swaps or whatever. It changes week to week, though. I think it's a lot of fun. It's especially fun. Probably my favorite part of the Devrel job is I get to see some of the new stuff before it comes out and I get to help build some of the first example proof of concepts for a lot of it. I did it with compressed NFts and state compression when I first joined. I got to tinker with it and figure out how it works, talk with the engineers that built it, and that was a lot of fun.
00:27:35.336 - 00:27:50.380, Speaker B: Now I get to help out with blinks and actions. But yeah, my favorite part is probably being able to build all those random example applications. Basically I can just build whatever I want and it counts as work, counts as dev Rel work. So that's a lot of fun.
00:27:51.040 - 00:28:34.340, Speaker A: So what would you say to like, because there are a lot of people, I see a lot of comments that like, engineers are like upcoming engineers who are just starting to get curious about like Dev Rel, what type of person like, because you're you sort of, I'm assuming that you never expected your career path to land you as a dev rel and potentially didn't even really know what they did. Like most people, when I was first offered a Devrel job at another blockchain project, I was, I was like, what the hell is that? And I had to like Google it and like sort of just made shit up as I went. But like what? Like anybody who's starting to get interested, like what's the profile? Or like what, what would these people, like, be interested in that would make them like, have a passion to do Devrel?
00:28:34.760 - 00:29:09.714, Speaker B: I think probably at the core it's probably like a passion for helping people, helping to educate. Cause that's like, in a nutshell, like, that is the job description. Like, you're helping people and you're educating. That education looks different and the way that you're helping people looks different depending on whatever Devrel niche you're in. But I think if you're passionate about helping people and educating and you like code Devrel, you are an engineer. You are writing code. How that code gets used is going to look different based off the specific dev rel role you have, but you still are writing code.
00:29:09.714 - 00:29:22.784, Speaker B: A lot of people think Dev Rel is only a marketing thing. You're only writing content and articles and videos and like, some people just don't think of that as like writing code. But you do write a lot of code. And I think for anyone.
00:29:22.832 - 00:29:24.260, Speaker A: I didn't, I didn't write any.
00:29:24.560 - 00:29:26.140, Speaker B: Well, you had people to write code.
00:29:26.520 - 00:29:35.760, Speaker A: That's true. I also was essentially just like Solana Steve Ballmer, where I sort of just like got all hot and got all hot and sweaty and screaming on Twitter.
00:29:35.840 - 00:29:37.312, Speaker B: But you had the hair, though, so it was good.
00:29:37.376 - 00:29:39.020, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:29:39.680 - 00:29:58.870, Speaker B: But I think for anyone who's trying to get a started in blockchain, Devrel is probably the easiest way to get started because, like, one, it's very approachable. It's like, hey, can you build something? Can you teach someone how to use the technology? That's a pretty approachable thing. There's a low barrier there. Well, a lower barrier.
00:29:58.990 - 00:30:01.782, Speaker A: And a lot of, a lot of people say that teaching is the best way to learn.
00:30:01.846 - 00:30:02.542, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:30:02.646 - 00:30:08.858, Speaker A: So having to, like, teach somebody to do something, you're essentially teaching yourself at the same time. And I'm sure you've experienced that.
00:30:08.934 - 00:30:52.084, Speaker B: Yep. And that, that circles back to, like, what I was saying earlier about, like, I know how I learn and it's, it's helping other people, teaching other people because, like, from the educator perspective of, like, I don't want to look like a fool when I'm teaching someone something that I have no idea, like, I feel terrible. So I want to make sure that I understand it extremely well to be able to teach it. And then it's like being receptive to feedback of like, hey, you, you said something that was weird or wrong. Um, can we talk about that? And then, you know, I'm always willing to be more educated. But, yeah, starting in Devrel is, I think, probably one. Starting in web3 is probably one of the easiest, actually easiest things to start in for the one reason of, especially if you're an engineer, it's Devrel.
00:30:52.084 - 00:31:19.232, Speaker B: You can do the job of Devrel without ever being paid to do it. So you can show a true proof of work, of what you're capable of doing by being on social media, by creating Twitter threads, creating videos, writing articles, you can do that and demonstrate that you can perform the job of Dev Rel. Which means you are proving to the public these companies and founders that need to hire Devrel people for their product in public.
00:31:19.296 - 00:31:39.738, Speaker A: Writing in public, teaching in public. In the early days, I would literally, it was hard to find people. Nobody really knew about Solana. So if somebody would write an article or reference implementation, I was like the LinkedIn, but for Twitter guy that I would jump in your DM's be like, hey, I saw your thing. What are you doing? Do you want to like come over here and hang out and work for me?
00:31:39.874 - 00:31:51.074, Speaker B: Yeah. And we still do that. We're looking for externals. Anyone who's interested in Devrel things, shoot me a DM. We're looking for more external people. Just like I got started. Just like John Liu got started, just like Jonas got started.
00:31:51.074 - 00:31:56.814, Speaker B: Chase Jacob Creech. It's how almost all of us got started as this like external Dev Rel.
00:31:56.982 - 00:31:59.086, Speaker A: Which is essentially just like works really well. Part time role.
00:31:59.158 - 00:32:02.206, Speaker B: Yeah, it's basically a part time somewhere like 10 hours a week.
00:32:02.398 - 00:32:40.910, Speaker A: Yeah. So shifting gears a bit, you've said blinks in actions like 69 times. So I know you really want to talk about this, but like, before we get into that, because I know that's. Before we get into that, like, let's. Because these are like pieces of technology that are recently be released that are really exciting things. But before we get the blinks and actions, let's talk a little bit about some, one of the ones right before that, which is token extensions, and just sort of like talk about what that actually is for everybody. We don't need to get too in depth, but essentially this is an extension onto the token program where you can do a lot of really cool stuff.
00:32:41.370 - 00:33:41.030, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the best way that I like to explain token extensions are typical SPL tokens. Like a typical token on the Solana blockchain that people are used to, but having the ability to use these extensions, which are basically standardized code that's already deployed and usable to add custom functionality to your tokens. You can basically pick and choose recipes in a cookbook. You're picking and choosing the ingredients for that recipe and the final dish, the final meal you're making is your token that has unique properties that other people don't necessarily have on theirs, they're not required to have. You can do all sorts of really interesting things like you can have an interest bearing token with the interest bearing extension, which is basically a native interest on the token that just accrues at the protocol level. And you can have native metadata on chain attached to the token using the metadata extension.
00:33:41.030 - 00:34:31.670, Speaker B: It's these really interesting, basically primitives that you can pick and choose to enable on your token at almost no development effort. So it shortcuts the amount of time it takes to build these very common things that people want with their tokens. And you can basically have like if you're deploying a token with a CLI, with the SPL token CLI, you just pass it a single flag of give me this token extension, give me that token extension. And then when you create it on chain, it's there. You don't have to do anything else. Same thing if you're doing it with JavaScript or rust, you just declare what token extensions, you give the configuration for that particular extension and then that's it. You don't have to write thousands of lines of code or hundreds of lines of code in order to enable all of these really powerful functionality within tokens.
00:34:32.010 - 00:35:22.180, Speaker A: Yeah, and I feel like people, because when we usually talk about token extensions, a lot of the times it's at a very technical level, but like the innovation that can be done on these things, token extensions are essentially just an extension of just a normal SPL token. But as an example, something that wasn't used to be possible is now you can add a transfer fee onto an SPL token. There's probably tons of ideas like okay, transfer fees, that's great. But if you think about it from a product point of view, there's probably some really interesting, underexplored, like, reasons why you would do that, like outside of just trying to make more money by like people transferring your token. So it's in a nutshell, there's. How many token extensions are there?
00:35:23.080 - 00:35:36.270, Speaker B: I think there's more than a, more than a dozen or somewhere around a dozen. And like, in theory there could be, you know, more if the maintainers want to add more. John Cinque is amazing, always adding more things. There's quite a few.
00:35:36.570 - 00:35:42.258, Speaker A: So, token extension, where can people learn more about all the different token extensions?
00:35:42.354 - 00:35:47.562, Speaker B: Solana.com tokenextensions okay, well that's simple enough.
00:35:47.746 - 00:36:13.630, Speaker A: All right, now to the part where you've been waiting for specifically, let's talk about actions and blanks. Last week, a huge announcement between dialect and Solana foundation and lots of people in the ecosystem who have been actively sort of like working around this. What are blanks and actions? Why are they useful? How is it going to make an impact? Just let me have it. Let's understand what's all the fuss about.
00:36:14.410 - 00:36:58.602, Speaker B: The fuss is because it's so cool. At their core, Solana actions are basically you have a typical web server that. It's an API, just like a rest API. You have an API that returns you metadata and a Solana transaction that Solana transaction can do. Anything a Solana transaction can do. That's like what Solana actions are. So it's like a standard interface specification to where any clients like a browser extension, a wallet, a mobile app, they can basically know how to get this transaction and the metadata associated with it from your API server to the client to the user in order to sign that transaction.
00:36:58.746 - 00:37:09.110, Speaker A: So what makes that powerful? What makes that useful on a non technical level? Because you sort of describe the API. What's useful about that?
00:37:10.290 - 00:37:12.030, Speaker B: I think it's most useful because.
00:37:13.850 - 00:37:14.138, Speaker A: How.
00:37:14.154 - 00:37:58.112, Speaker B: Should I phrase this? It's a standard that allows you to get a Solana transaction. So it makes it so anyone can have true composability, even easier composability, where you can have, any application can immediately get transactions from another application. So you can do all sorts of interesting things there. Someone else could compose on top of the Jupyter swap, even easier now. So it removes a lot of assorted friction points that a lot of people can have. Then it ties into Blinks, which blinks are basically the front end version of it. It's a standardized user interface that takes that metadata about what this action endpoint is supposed to do.
00:37:58.112 - 00:38:39.410, Speaker B: What is this transaction supposed to give me? It gives you the standard metadata about it. And you can display an interface, you can inject it into the page right now just on x.com. comma, on Twitter. It makes it so the user, like a person can immediately, they can see a link that's shared on social media or in theory, any website. They can get a user interface that allows them to connect their wallet to these websites that they're already at. It's the truest form of bringing crypto to where users are and what makes it a superpower, it makes it incredibly interesting to me is that we currently have blinks on X.com. comma, on Twitter.
00:38:39.410 - 00:39:12.160, Speaker B: The Twitter developers, the maintainers of Twitter, they had to do zero work for it. The browser extensions that people already know and love, you phantom, soulflare, backpack for their wallets. They already have their crypto wallets. The browser extensions handle it. They just make it happen under the hood. So it makes it so these browser extensions and any action client, any blink client can basically give this user interface to people where they're already at on the Internet and allow them to interact on the Solana blockchain to do anything a transaction can do.
00:39:12.660 - 00:39:41.966, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, just to sort of paint a picture for everybody listening, what I've started to see is like people are creating these custom blanks and they're sharing them on X. And instead of like, having to go to some protocol, I can just, I see somebody's tweet, it's a blink. It says stake on my validator. Or like, minthe's NFT directly from Twitter. I hit the button, wallet connects, boom, boom, boom, and it's done. And like, this is, this is extremely different in the past because you would have to go to some protocols website, maybe it's confusing.
00:39:41.966 - 00:40:03.766, Speaker A: You have to like, connect your wallet. You have to figure out what that, like, how this whole thing works. But now it's just a button. It can be, it can be many different things, but a button on Twitter that says stake with me, minthe's NFT. Or do any type of transaction directly from, like, the entry point can be anywhere on the web. It could be Reddit, it could be discord, it could be telegram. Currently, X is the only place where it's supported.
00:40:03.766 - 00:40:08.654, Speaker A: But in the future, people will be able to interact with blinks all over the place, right?
00:40:08.742 - 00:40:33.054, Speaker B: Absolutely. That's the goal. All over the Internet, anywhere people are browsing. The Internet could, in theory, display these user interfaces, these blinks, to allow people to connect. There's a lot of really interesting ways that this could appear outside of just social media. Sure, crypto Twitter, great and all, but, like, not everyone's on crypto Twitter. Like, there's other social media platforms that people use, but there's also not social media.
00:40:33.054 - 00:40:49.806, Speaker B: Like, imagine one of my things that I'm really enjoying to think about is email. People use email all the time. Like it or hate it, most jobs require it. People love email. I know you do. People love email newsletters, though. They're very passionate about their email newsletters.
00:40:49.806 - 00:41:32.176, Speaker B: Creators publish content all the time using blinks as a standard within the Solana ecosystem and across the Internet. It can make it so a creative can publish their works, whether it's some sort of art visual medium, or it could be written content, like they're publishing a substack newsletter, they are delivering email newsletters to you directly in your inbox. Imagine if you're on@gmail.com comma. You get an email newsletter from your favorite newsletter that you've been loyally subscribed to for a while, and you have a button right then and there to immediately be able to get a transaction immediately. Tip the artist, tip the creator. You can immediately mint that as an NFT.
00:41:32.176 - 00:41:37.168, Speaker B: You could claim a limited edition collectible just because you're already there in that one place.
00:41:37.304 - 00:41:56.008, Speaker A: And that's, like, essentially anywhere on the canvas of the Internet, like, medium articles, like, anywhere, wherever where you can visibly see something online that a blink could exist there, which makes it much easier than having to go to a website and do x, y, and z. Like, now it's like they're bringing the blockchain to you.
00:41:56.104 - 00:42:02.060, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. So it's very exciting. I'm excited to see all the cool things that people built.
00:42:04.120 - 00:42:19.244, Speaker A: So that sounds awesome. Everybody seems excited. I actually. It shut down Twitter for a day, basically. I didn't see anything else on my feed. That was pretty wild, to be honest, because it's so exciting. You saw people from other ecosystems, like, even in, like, the EvM world, being like, holy shit.
00:42:19.244 - 00:42:22.900, Speaker A: Like, this is. This is awesome.
00:42:23.020 - 00:42:26.996, Speaker B: Punk 6529 was like, wow, this is cool. And I was like, yes, we got them.
00:42:27.068 - 00:42:30.076, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So Solana is not just meme coins, is that what you're saying?
00:42:30.148 - 00:42:31.520, Speaker B: Yeah, we're weird.
00:42:32.100 - 00:42:46.166, Speaker A: Who would have thought? I want to move along a little bit and talk about one other thing. Obviously, we talked at the beginning of the show. This is the. This is the very last episode, um, of chewing glass.
00:42:46.278 - 00:42:47.110, Speaker B: Sad day.
00:42:47.270 - 00:43:12.966, Speaker A: Yeah, sad, sad day. Can we get the, uh, the crying, like, sound bite added to this? We've never done that before, but, um, just pretending like I'm Joe Rogan or something like that. Get you a mix. So we talked about this a while ago. I invited you on and saying, like, hey, I initially, I had said, hey, do you want to take over the show? But you. You respectfully declined because you actually run a similar podcast to mine, which is called the Sulfate Pod. You and James.
00:43:12.966 - 00:43:14.966, Speaker A: James whatever his last name is.
00:43:15.118 - 00:43:17.090, Speaker B: Run Apocalypse. I don't know.
00:43:17.830 - 00:43:22.270, Speaker A: I don't think I've ever tried to pronounce it, actually. I was just like, I don't think I have either.
00:43:22.430 - 00:43:25.638, Speaker B: Pacheco Panchenko. I don't know. There's no way to know.
00:43:25.774 - 00:43:54.760, Speaker A: We'll just call that correct. So, anyways, part of this was essentially like, there's other great podcasts out there. You know, we have lightspeed pod and we have unlayered and stuff. But you do, you do very similar stuff to what I do on the show. You talk to a lot of developers and founders and a lot of cool stuff. So I think we wanted to sort of discuss your podcast, like what it is, pitch the audience why they should be start to watch your podcasts, because now they're not going to see my beautiful face anymore.
00:43:54.840 - 00:43:58.144, Speaker B: I mean, I don't have the luxurious hair that chase has. So there's.
00:43:58.192 - 00:43:59.656, Speaker A: I can donate. I can donate some.
00:43:59.728 - 00:44:22.596, Speaker B: Bet. I'll put it on the shelf. I've got all sorts of shelf. I have a fake plant that Vibhu sent me because he rugged me on my fake plant. That was a Christmas present before, you know. Yeah, yeah. So, like the elevator pitch for sulfate is we talk with builders and founders in the Solana ecosystem, and, you know, anyone can be a builder doing random things.
00:44:22.596 - 00:44:50.752, Speaker B: A lot of times we do end up talking with, we lean more technical than less technical because James and I are both developers that are both very passionate about the Solana ecosystem. So we've had, you know, Chase has been on the show before. We've had tons and tons of the big names that you would expect. We had Toli on the, on the show, which was very interesting. We talked almost nothing about Solana when Toli was on the show. And we. Yeah, so we, we talk with builders and founders that are doing interesting things.
00:44:50.752 - 00:45:14.346, Speaker B: We dive into a lot of the, the why of why they're building and, like, why they're taking certain approaches. We get this actually a lot. Our guests, when they come on, a lot of them have told us after recording of like, wow, you guys asked a lot of questions. I wasn't expecting founders. They launch a product, they go on the podcast circuit. They do a bunch of interviews, answer.
00:45:14.378 - 00:45:15.626, Speaker A: The same question over and over again.
00:45:15.658 - 00:45:37.888, Speaker B: They answer the same question over and over, and we don't ask those same questions. A perfect example I love to give of this is Armani came on. He's been on the show twice now. Armani came on. The first time he came on, mad lads had just launched. It was the hotness that was going on in the chain. All the cool things they were doing with backpack and xnfts and we didn't talk about any of that.
00:45:37.888 - 00:45:49.160, Speaker B: We were basically like, hey, Armani. Yeah, mad lads are cool. We each have one. They're cool. I like the art. And what are your thoughts on building a community? Like, you're building a community in blockchain. You're building a startup in blockchain.
00:45:49.160 - 00:46:21.830, Speaker B: You're a founder. Like, what's your founder mentality? The second time harmony was on, backpack exchange had just launched, and we're like, it was the hot topic. And we're like, yeah, backpack exchange is cool, but let's talk about global compliance. What does compliance mean? You're operating in certain jurisdictions and why these decisions that you're making? So that's the things we talk about. Toli was on Solana Mobile. I think chapter two had recently been announced of, hey, it's going to be a thing. And we basically talked about nothing.
00:46:21.830 - 00:46:29.218, Speaker B: Solana, we talked about him being passionate about the human body and pushing the human body to limits. At the very end, it was like.
00:46:29.274 - 00:46:30.698, Speaker A: Did you talk about underwater hockey?
00:46:30.754 - 00:46:50.220, Speaker B: We did talk about underwater hockey. We talked about founder mentality and things like that. At the very end, he's like, I guess I should mention Solana mobile in chapter two, I guess. And we're like, cool. Sounds good. But I guess that's the long elevator pitch. Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
00:46:50.220 - 00:47:25.930, Speaker B: We started it before I joined the Solana foundation, and I just kept it going. And it's been a lot of fun being able to have these conversations with the people that we all see from crypto Twitter, and it's humanizing the people that are building. You always get a different Persona of a person from crypto Twitter vice when you have a direct conversation with them and you can ask them interesting questions and, like, kind of figure out how their brain works a little bit and, like, why they're either personally or professionally making the decisions they're making. I find that very, very interesting. And.
00:47:26.670 - 00:48:04.274, Speaker A: And that's kind of why, like, I continue to do the show, like, up until now, is because, like, having these conversations, learning people's origin stories, being surprised every episode, when you hear something from somebody that, like, you never expected, it's like, it's. It's fun for you to do, like, on your podcast, but it's also great to sort of peel back those layers and then, like, let other people see and, like you said, like, humans, like, animal pfps on Twitter and really sort of, like, getting behind it. And I like that you guys do the non sort of, like, standard questioning around, like, people who are, like, launching a project and doing all that sort of stuff. Awesome pod. What's the Twitter at? So people can find you?
00:48:04.362 - 00:48:09.858, Speaker B: Sulfatepod. S o l f a t e. Cool.
00:48:10.034 - 00:48:26.834, Speaker A: All right, so check it out since you will no longer be seeing me anymore. Nick and James do an incredible job. So check out soul hip pod. And so we're going to wrap this up. We're going to do a quick speed round. I always do this for every guest. We have three questions.
00:48:26.834 - 00:48:34.550, Speaker A: One is like, what sucks about Solana development? The beginning of your existence, if you will, error messages.
00:48:36.170 - 00:48:55.920, Speaker B: There's a whole bunch of stuff that have been updated recently and fixed recently. People need to update their packages, error messages. And then dependencies are always dependencies. A lot of efforts going into fixed dependencies across the ecosystem, multiple organizations, we're just not quite there yet. It's gotten better, just not quite there yet.
00:48:56.080 - 00:49:06.434, Speaker A: These things are incremental. And eventually, if you just stopped paying attention today and then you came back in one year, you would notice the major change. But when it's incremental, like, you have a recency bias.
00:49:06.482 - 00:49:07.954, Speaker B: It's really what it comes down to.
00:49:08.122 - 00:49:14.150, Speaker A: Exactly. You're just like, nothing's changed. Like, go back to the old way and then tell me that nothing's changed.
00:49:14.610 - 00:49:20.830, Speaker B: I take it as a success note when Noah Prince is complaining about JavaScript, that means things are getting better.
00:49:21.210 - 00:49:31.324, Speaker A: Yeah. So what's, okay, so now that we said what sucks about Solana? What's great about Solana development? Like, for you personally, it's the people.
00:49:31.412 - 00:50:04.290, Speaker B: Hands down, there's always so many people that are building interesting things. A lot of them are sharing it on social media and discord and telegram chats. But it's people are building things and you can ask them about it and you can just get real nerdy. And that's one of my favorite things to do is just nerd out with developers that are building cool things. I'll just randomly shoot them a DM or just ask publicly on Twitter and be like, this thing that you did was interesting, or this was weird. Why did you do it like that? And they'll just answer and you could just like, get that feedback immediately and that's like amazing.
00:50:04.410 - 00:50:32.214, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. And final thing, what sort of advice would you give to anybody watching this show? Like, assuming there's like some up and comers, there's some people that are thinking about getting into development. And it also as pertains to Devereux as well, since that's another, like, route or avenue that people could take. Like, what's the advice that you would give for somebody who's, like, thinking about taking that plunge or just getting started? Because lots of people jump into these things and they give up. They feel intimidated or whatever. So what's, what's some advice you would have on that?
00:50:32.302 - 00:50:56.694, Speaker B: Yeah, start now. The classic adage, the best time to build a tree was or plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is now. It's now. Start building your tree. You can start showing your ability to work with the Solana technology in all its shapes and forms. You can create content, and that is hands down an easy way, probably the easiest way to get hired within the ecosystem.
00:50:56.694 - 00:51:18.510, Speaker B: If you're trying to shift full time, show your ability to contribute to the ecosystem in good, productive ways and people will notice. Feel free to tag me. Tag chase. Chase will keep posting on Twitter. He's never going to leave that place. And that's probably the biggest one. And the other one is probably pay it forward.
00:51:18.510 - 00:52:01.880, Speaker B: If you are new to Solana, you have a different perspective or new to development, or you're new to a particular section of it, you have a fresh perspective. Pay it forward by a bringing up that perspective of like, hey, maybe this documentation was weird or didn't exist. This tooling gave me weird error messages. If you either create an issue, at the very least, please create GitHub issues tracking for all these things, all these friction points that we can fix as an ecosystem and make better as an ecosystem. That's kind of like the pay it forward is like if you run into a problem, you can either solve that problem for the next person to make it easier for everybody else. That's just death by a thousand cuts. We can remove some of those cuts.
00:52:01.880 - 00:52:05.440, Speaker B: That's probably the easiest way. Those two.
00:52:06.140 - 00:52:15.684, Speaker A: Yeah. And if you are interested in Devrel roles, make sure to look up Nick Frosty on X Twitter. What's the handle? Nick Frostbutter.
00:52:15.732 - 00:52:16.842, Speaker B: Nick Frosty.
00:52:17.036 - 00:52:17.582, Speaker A: Nick Frosty.
00:52:17.606 - 00:52:24.810, Speaker B: I'm Nick Frosty everywhere except for discord because some monster took it and I have an underscore in my discord. It's the only place I have an underscore.
00:52:25.830 - 00:52:40.570, Speaker A: Well, cool. Nick, thanks for joining, man. Thanks for having me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, it was great. I'm glad to have you on. Like, I'm, I'm hope, I'm hoping lots of fans of the show end up going and becoming fans of soul fate pod, if they're not already.
00:52:40.570 - 00:52:57.776, Speaker A: Again, everybody, thank you for everything. This is the final episode. This is the final farewell. But, you know, I'm still terminally online, so it's not like I'm going anywhere. I'm just not going to be on camera anymore. All right, Nick, cheers again. Thanks for coming.
00:52:57.776 - 00:53:01.472, Speaker A: And I won't see you next time. Bye.
